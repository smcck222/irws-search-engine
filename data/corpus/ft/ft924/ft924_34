FT  23 OCT 92 / People: Sir John Quinton heralds new era at Wimpey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Clifford Chetwood, chairman of Wimpey, is saying goodbye after 40 years
with the company.
Two years ago Sir Clifford (right) relinquished the dual posts of chief
executive and chairman and is now to be replaced as non-executive chairman
by Sir John Quinton (left) who stands down as chairman of Barclays Bank at
the end of this year.
It is the first time that Wimpey has gone outside the group for such a
senior appointment. Sir Clifford, who became chairman in 1981 and chief
executive a year later was groomed by Sir Godfrey Mitchell, the man who
turned Wimpey from a small west London stonemasons into the country's second
largest housebuilder.
Sir Godfrey, who as a young army captain acquired Wimpey in 1919, dominated
the group's management until his retirement more than half a century later.
By the time Sir Clifford took over, the management structure was generally
seen to be inadequate for such a large group. Financial arrangements had
been handled by Sir Godfrey - who was vehemently opposed to any borrowing -
and by two other directors.
Housebuilding in the UK had risen to account for a disproportionate amount
of the group's annual profits which left it vulnerable to a sharp decline in
the UK housing market.
Much of Sir Clifford's time was taken up in reorganising a group of separate
businesses run by 17 separate, largely autonomous, regional companies.
The task of turning such a large ship was always going to be difficult. Sir
Clifford's efforts were eventually frustrated by the collapse of the UK
residential and commercial property markets at the end of the 1980s.
The task of steering the group to better climes has fallen to Joe Dwyer,
chief executive, and to Sir John Quinton.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Management: All change for a successful corporate revolution
 -Christopher Lorenz argues that companies must be more radical in
regenerating themselves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To most business people, the word 'transformation' is a synonym for
'change'. They would certainly apply it to corporate reshaping of the scale
achieved at British Airways under Sir Colin Marshall, at Grand Metropolitan
under Sir Allen Sheppard, or at SmithKline Beecham under Robert Bauman.
But to many academics and consultants, the word stands for nothing short of
a revolution. Which is why quite a number of them are muttering that none of
the three contrasting cases really justifies the use of such a dramatic
word.
Under Sir Colin BA has been transmogrified from operations-minded laggard to
marketing star, while Sir Allen has led Grand Met away from messy British
conglomeracy to focused global leadership - albeit also with a new
dedication to the customer. Bob Bauman has masterminded Beecham's unusually
successful drugs merger with SmithKline.
In this sense, complaint about 'transformation' falls into the same category
as many people's growing dislike of the loose and ubiquitous term 'change
management' to describe anything from the introduction of a 'total quality'
programme to a complete revolution in the way a company is organised, or
behaves.
But the trouble with 'transformation' goes further than that. To use the
well-trodden language of leadership research, Sir Colin, Sir Allen and
Bauman are all undoubtedly 'transformational' leaders whose achievements are
very considerable indeed. But with the greatest possible respect to all
three, none has had to accomplish quite the sort of transformation (in the
sense of revolution) which now faces, say, John Akers at IBM. Not only are
Akers and his senior colleagues having to stage-manage an internal
revolution in organisational structure, market-orientation and managerial
behaviour, they are trying to do so at a time when the company's competitive
environment is in turmoil and its strategy in virtual tatters.
The shadow of IBM hung very clearly over the annual three-day conference
last week of the international Strategic Management Society, on 'strategic
renaissance - the transformation of economic enterprise'. Held in London
this year, it was attended by more than 500 managers, academics and
consultants from around the world. Its speakers included not only Sir Allen,
Bauman and BA's Sir Colin, (on 'From Bloody Awful to Bloody Awesome'), but
also senior executives from ABB, Shell, Unilever and elsewhere, plus a host
of top business academics.
The talking point of the event was a speech by Richard Pascale, whose
consulting, book-writing and teaching at Stanford University have made him
one of the most sought-after American advisers on how to accomplish radical
change.
To him, transformation involves not only 'a discontinuous shift in an
organisation's capability', but also 'the ability to sustain that shift',
which can be far harder. 'Part of it is to do with altering the future,' he
declared last week.
As Pascale pointed out, the difficulty of detecting the need for a
transformation even in the midst of success ('or excess') was illustrated
starkly in the mid-1980s. Only five years after the 1982 best seller, In
Search of Excellence, was published, all but 14 of its 43 'excellent'
companies had either grown weaker or were really on the slide, in spite of
the best efforts of their bosses to improve things.
In a memorable accusation at the audience around him, Pascale declared:
'This shows we don't know what we're doing.' In 50 years' time, today's
business academics and consultants might be judged to be as foolish as the
doctors of the middle ages, he said. The latter examined their patients and
then, in all sincerity but whatever the malady, applied leeches. And, of
course, gathered fat fees.
Faced with the need for change, companies come to a fork in the road, argued
Pascale. About 80 per cent take the easy route, stripping themselves 'back
to basics', searching for the doctor's latest tools and techniques - and
going on to risk stagnation or decline.
Only a fifth of companies take the much tougher, alternative route. This
involves three big steps: what Pascale called 'inquiring into their
underlying paradigm' (that is, questioning the way they do everything -
including think); attacking the problems systematically on all fronts,
notably strategy, operations, organisation and culture; and 'reinventing'
themselves in such a way that the transformation becomes self-sustaining.
This is deep stuff. So deep that it embraces not just 'doing' new things but
also what Pascale called 'being' (or 'living') them. In other words, the
heart must be transformed, as well as the head. Or, in the jargon of
academic 'learning' theory, intellectual learning must be matched by
emotional learning if any kind of transformation is to become really
'embedded'.
All of which is far easier said than done, as can be attested by Grand Met,
SmithKline Beecham and other companies which have accomplished deep but not
quite 'transformational' change. Though Pascale puts BA in the
transformation category, the conference mutterers would not. But they would
concur on beleaguered IBM.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Management: Going for the capitalist option: Perks / A look
at the growth of employee share ownership schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Employee share ownership is like motherhood and apple pie; everyone seems to
be in favour of it. Those on the right believe that employees who are given
a stake in capitalism will be more productive and less inclined to
disruption. Those on the left argue that workers are entitled to share the
fruits of their company's success.
The popularity of such schemes is such that nearly 1.5m employees and
directors are estimated to have received shares or options worth more than
Pounds 3bn in the year to March 1991. According to a recent survey by the
Confederation of British Industry, 44 per cent of companies offer
share-ownership schemes to at least some of their employees.
During the early 1980s, however, it seemed that the benefits of share option
schemes were mainly confined to directors. There was an intellectual
rationale behind the trend. By creating a commonality of interest between
directors and their institutional shareholders, both could benefit. The 20th
century barriers between the owners and the managers of capital could be
partly broken down.
The problem was the 1980s bull market. Directors made small fortunes through
their options, regardless of individual or corporate performance.
Institutional shareholders started to impose limits and performance targets
to prevent excessive dilution of their shareholdings. In the late 1980s and
early 1990s, the problem has been turned around. Tumbling stock markets have
left many directors with options which are not profitable to exercise -
'underwater' in the jargon.
This is not to say that schemes have lost all popularity. 'Options are
recognised as a status symbol,' says Damien Carnell of New Bridge Street
Consultants. By the end of financial year 1990-91, some 4,721 companies had
executive-based schemes in place.
But governments have worked hard to encourage the adoption of all-employee
schemes by, for example, allowing directors to receive discounted options in
schemes which are open to all the workforce.
One all-employee plan achieving growing popularity is the save-as-you-earn
scheme. A total of 972 schemes had been approved by the end of 1990-91, with
more than 500,000 employees taking part.
Under such schemes, employees are given options to buy shares in five or
seven years' time - and the exercise price is normally set at a 20 per cent
discount at the time the options are granted.
In addition, employees are given 'interest' in the form of a bonus at the
end of the five or seven-year period. This bonus now represents the
equivalent of 12 monthly contributions after five years, and 25 monthly
contributions after seven years. That translates into compound annual
returns of 7.5 per cent and 7.38 per cent respectively.
This interest is tax-free, and so represents an attractive return even if
the options become worthless. If the employee does make a gain on the share
options, that is subject to capital gains, not income tax.
Since each individual is entitled to realise Pounds 5,800 of tax-free
capital gains (after allowance for the effects of inflation) in a financial
year, most people can avoid paying tax on their gains; simply by selling
their shares over several years or by placing Pounds 3,000 worth in a single
company Personal Equity Plan, on which no CGT is payable.
Up to Pounds 250 a month can be saved via this system and the gains can be
huge. In 1986, for example, Wellcome employees were given the right to buy
shares in five years' time for Pounds 1.29. Just after the end of the five
year period, those who had invested Pounds 50 a month (Pounds 3,000 in all)
would have been entitled to shares worth more than Pounds 24,000.
As word has spread among the workforce of the advantages of such schemes,
more and more employees have signed up. Some companies with substantial
workforces have encountered dilution constraints, where they want to issue
more shares than their institutional shareholders will allow.
One route round the dilution problem is the employee share ownership trust.
This is a body with certain tax advantages which is able to buy existing
shares in the market - thus avoiding the need to issue new shares.
Trusts have often been used as part of management buy-out plans to encourage
cross-company support for the deal. Usually, such schemes involve no
financial commitment on the part of the employee; instead the trust buys the
shares - using a loan guaranteed by the company - and then gives them to
workers. Provided the employee holds the shares for five years, the gift is
free from income tax. Although many employees have prospered through such
plans, whether any of these schemes actually represent an effective means of
widening share ownership is doubtful.
In many cases, directors and employees sell their shares as soon as the tax
rules allow. In effect, therefore, share schemes are often merely a complex
way of giving staff a delayed cash bonus.
Carnell says that companies are trying to find ways round this problem by
looking at alternative structures such as restricted share schemes - under
which executives are given free shares which cannot be sold for a set period
 -or equity partnership schemes - under which companies give matching free
shares to executives who are prepared to commit their own funds to
purchases.
It has yet to be proved conclusively that either director, or
employee-based, share schemes benefit companies in the long run in terms of
improved profitability. And companies where employees have a significant
stake in the equity are still a rarity.
But as long as schemes continue to receive the support of the politicians
and tax authorities, it is hard to see them going out of fashion.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Raymond Hunter, appointed active underwriter of Sturge syndicate 122 this
week, is one of a selected band of qualified actuaries to occupy prominent
positions at the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Hunter, 45, is an experienced insurer of North American liability insurance
and an expert in medical malpractice, lines of insurance where the ability
to calculate the right level of reserves is vitally important. A mathematics
graduate and an Associate of the Institute of Actuaries, Hunter was formerly
senior underwriter of non-marine special risks at Terra Nova Insurance.
Terry Hayday, the chief executive of Sturge Holdings, which manages
syndicate 122, describes Hunter as 'clear in his ideas and clean cut' and
says that members' agents - who channel Names into syndicates - have been
impressed by his style.
In a separate move, Colin Owen, 41, has been appointed deputy chairman of
Sturge motor and personal risks. Owen has been at Lloyd's since 1967 and is
active underwriter of syndicate 718. Owen is also chairman of the Lloyd's
Non-marine Association's personal accident sub-committee.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Alan Langlands, who joined the National Health Service as a management
trainee in 1974, moves into the high-profile post of deputy chief executive
on January 1.
He will replace Andrew Foster, who has been appointed to head the Audit
Commission following Howard Davies's move to become director-general of the
Confederation of British Industry.
Langlands will deputise for Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, and will
head the service's performance management directorate which aims to improve
the quality and cost-effectiveness of health care.
He is currently general manager of North West Thames regional health
authority, one of the four regional authorities responsible for overseeing
health services in London and south-east England, and his new post will be
filled on secondment from the region.
His promotion will put him at one remove from the controversy about to break
out over proposals to close hospitals in the capital.
A graduate of Glasgow University, Langlands, 40, has held a range of other
management posts in the NHS, including manager of London's Middlesex and
University College hospitals. During the late 1980s he had a spell as a
health care management consultant.
The new post will test Langlands' patience with train travel. Arrangements
are in progress to move the head-quarters of the NHS management executive
from London to Leeds, and senior officials are likely to find themselves
spending a good deal of time in transit between the new Yorkshire
headquarters and Whitehall.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (16): At least you
get your money back - What's New? / These are nervous times in the equity
markets, and the life companies are sympathetic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER A rocky five years for equity investment, five-year money-back
guarantees have been showering on to the market with the frequency of autumn
leaves.
Three of the latest offerings - all single-premium insurance bonds -
highlight some of the main variations in terms and conditions.
With Lloyds Bank's Black Horse Life, the Guaranteed Capital Bond guarantees
to pay back at least the original investment after five years. Seventy per
cent of the money goes into a fixed-rate bond guaranteed to produce 100 per
cent of the initial investment at the end of five years, with the remaining
30 per cent spread over up to 10 Black Horse Life unit-linked funds. The
minimum investment is Pounds 3,000, with a maximum of Pounds 100,000.
The guarantee does not apply if investors cash in early.
As well as money back after five years, Laurentian Life's Capital Protected
Bond guarantees a percentage of any gain in the FT-SE 100 index over the
period.
On investments of between the Pounds 5,000 minimum and Pounds 19,999, the
guarantee is full return of the initial investment or 115 per cent of the
five-year rise in the Footsie. On Pounds 20,000 to Pounds 49,999, the
respective guarantees are 101 per cent of the initial money or 116 per cent
of the FT-SE 100 rise, with a maximum return of 101.5 per cent of the
initial money back and 116.75 per cent of the Footsie percentage rise on
investments of Pounds 50,000 and above. There is no upper limit on
investments.
However, the gain is taxable at the life company rate, and the guarantee
applies only at the end of the five-year period, expiring on December 17,
1997.
Laurentian points out that investors who come out of the bond before the
five-year stage are unlikely to recover their money in full.
With Citibank Life's Capital Guarantee 100, the guaranteed return of 100 per
cent of the FT-SE 100 rise is after basic rate tax but before the initial
charge of 5 per cent. So investors would get approximately 95 per cent of
the Footsie rise, tax paid.
As the bond is to be backed by financial derivatives, it should reflect the
value of the index more directly than bonds linked to life funds holding
component stocks of the FT-SE 100.
Investors who pay an additional 3 per cent charge on the initial investment
(the minimum is Pounds 3,000) can lock in the gain on the index if this
should hit 50 per cent above the level when Capital Guarantee starts on
December 11, 1992, at any time during the life of the bond. This means that,
if the index falls back after a 50 per cent rise, investors who have bought
the lock-in will have their returns rebased from the point where the index
had risen by 50 per cent.
After one year, Capital Guarantee bondholders will be able to take out a
loan from Citibank equivalent to 40 per cent of their initial investment in
the bond. Interest on the loan will be charged at 3 per cent over Midland
Bank base rate.
At present, this would come to an annual percentage rate of 12.6 per cent.
The only guarantee with 'Pepit', a new investment trust from Foreign &amp;
Colonial, is that F&amp;C will be sticking to its contrarian policy of trying to
buy when others are selling and selling as prices rise.
Investment manager Jeremy Tigue said the strategy had worked well after the
1987 crash and after the invasion of Kuwait, and the group was hoping that
now was a similar time in the UK market.
Qualifying for the maximum Pounds 6,000 Pep investment, the Pepit trust will
initially have about 90 per cent of its investments companies in UK
companies, with 75 per cent in FT-SE 100 stocks and the rest in smaller blue
chips. The remaining 10 per cent will be invested in continental companies,
such as Bayer, Siemens and L'Oreal.
Mr Tigue said the UK was a better place to invest than the rest of Europe at
present, being further down the recession route. He explained that F&amp;C would
concentrate on big international companies with large overseas earnings, so
as to reduce dependence on the UK economy.
Initial expenses are limited to 2.5 per cent of the gross proceeds of the
share issue plus VAT, while the annual management fee is to be 0.4 per cent
of gross assets plus VAT.
The gross dividend yield on Pepit, after expenses, is estimated at 4.5 per
cent annually, with a one-third/two-thirds split between the interim and
final dividends.
Japanese warrants, one of the most volatile forms of financial instrument,
are the main portfolio component in a Luxembourg hedge fund denominated in
sterling, to be launched by the Cresvale group.
Cresvale says it will aim to neutralise the underlying equity market risk of
buying warrants by taking short positions in equity index futures, and use
currency options and futures in an attempt to remove the impact of exchange
rate fluctuations.
Such techniques do not come cheaply. Although the fund does not have a
front-end charge, it levies an annual 1.75 per cent management fee, plus a
steep performance-related fee based on the appreciation in the fund's net
asset value during its financial year. For example, if net asset value per
share rises by between 15 and 20 per cent, 10 per cent of the excess
increase above 15 per cent goes into the performance-related fee.
Aimed primarily at institutional investors, the fund is on offer to
sophisticated private investors with a minimum of Pounds 10,000 to invest.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (15): Volatile forex
climate upsets the rules - Bonds / Long gilts have been hit by inflationary
fears, but index-linked may benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN

<TEXT>
THE KEY to bond market performance over the past three months has been in
picking the right currency.
The gradual collapse of confidence, in the wake of Denmark's rejection of
the Maastricht treaty in June, has eroded the theory of 'convergence' - that
progress towards European monetary union would drive down European interest
rates. Then, the appearance of untenable strains within the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) created turmoil in the foreign exchange market, which has
dominated bond trading.
Volatile foreign exchange conditions have reversed traditional criteria for
bond investments. Instead of looking for economic slowdown to push bond
yields, weak economic conditions have become signals of potential or actual
currency weakness. Since investors are focusing on currency considerations,
a strong economy, normally negative for bonds, has become a positive sign
that the currency will prove a safe haven from the turmoil in the foreign
exchange market.
For sterling investors, the Deutsche Mark bloc - German Bunds, Dutch and
Belgian bonds - has provided an attractive harbour in the storm. For the
year to date, Bunds have provided returns of 22 per cent for sterling based
investors, compared with 8.3 per cent in local currency terms, according to
JP Morgan's benchmark government bond index.
As well as offering currency gains, the strength of the D-Mark means that
the Bundesbank still has plenty of room to cut interest rates, unlike most
other European central banks.
Defensive positioning against further currency turmoil is expected to remain
a priority for investors. The Yes vote in the French referendum on
Maastricht, in September, failed to glue Europe's exchange rate system back
together, and pressures within the system show little sign of abating.
'Fixed-income investors should overweight funds in the core European bond
markets,' according to Mr Adrian James, international bond strategist at
NatWest Capital Markets. 'Investment in other European markets carries a
much higher degree of currency risk, and is probably best limited to
short-term instruments.'
Under these conditions, the high-yielding bond markets are still likely to
be shunned. Italian and Spanish bond markets attracted a massive inflow of
foreign investment in recent years, as yields tumbled on expectations of
convergence. But doubts about the future of European monetary union have
severely undermined both bond and currency markets. The return on benchmark
Italian government bonds in the third quarter was -2 per cent for sterling
based investors, compared with -1.1 per cent for Spanish government bonds,
according to the JP Morgan index. At the start of the fourth quarter, prices
were still in freefall.
'There may be a gross undervaluation of the lira at these levels, but the
fact is that no one can say where the floor is,' said Mr Michael Burke,
international bond strategist at Yamaichi International.
The other markets to have benefited from a flight to safety from European
bonds are the US and Japanese bond markets, despite the low interest rates
on offer.
Despite rather jittery market conditions ahead of the US presidential
elections, there are expectations of further interest rate cuts, and the
dollar is being viewed as a relatively safe haven.
In Japan, signs that the economy is weakening rapidly are boosting
expectations of further declines in interest rates, and the bond market has
also benefited from weak stock prices. However, some analysts are concerned
that the negative economic data could result in a bout of currency weakness.
Switzerland has also enjoyed a revival of its traditional role as a safe
haven for investors.
Despite the dangers of navigating foreign exchange risk, the returns offered
by international bond markets are likely to tempt investors away from the UK
gilts market, which is currently offering rather poor prospects.
Although short-dated gilts have received some support from expectations of a
further interest rate cut, the longer end of the market has been severely
hit by inflationary fears, exacerbated by the economic policy vacuum left in
the wake of sterling's withdrawal from ERM. One area which could stand to
benefit is the index-linked sector, which has held up well in recent
turmoil.
Unit trusts investing in international bonds have dramatically outperformed
comparable gilt funds. According to data from Finstat, international bond
funds have provided an average return in the last three months of 8.5 per
cent, compared with 0.4 per cent for gilt funds. (Going back nine months,
the disparity is smaller, with 9.8 per cent for international bond funds and
7.4 per cent for gilt funds.)
In the past three months, Legal and General's international bond fund leads
the 26 international fixed-interest unit trusts tracked by Finstat, with
returns of 13.3 per cent. Guinness Flight's unfortunately-named Emu Trust
recorded a 0.5 decline in September, perhaps not surprisingly.
However, given the volatility of currency markets, bonds may not be the best
investments, particularly for retail investors. There are distinct
advantages to putting cash on deposit, because of the lower risk.
'Retail investors probably won't miss out on very much if they keep their
money in cash deposits. At this point in the economic cycle, cash is king,'
said Mr Burke.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Improved liquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDITY problem that dogged the sterling cash market in the early part
of this week eased yesterday after most of the shortage forecast by the Bank
of England was removed in the early round, writes James Blitz.
For most of this week, the sterling market has been very illiquid. This is
partly because of the reluctance of dealers to offer bills to the Bank at
current dealing rates, fearing that there will be another base rate cut to
follow last Friday's.
Last week, for example, the Bank issued a 26-day repurchase agreement at the
9 per cent structure of base rates, only to signal a cut in base rates two
days later. Dealers would not want to be caught out by such a move again.
There are also big shortages in the market. This is partly due to the tax
collection period which begins around now, leaving banks short of funds.
But one discount house dealer said that the market continues to be hampered
by the absence of a broad base of liquidity. Discount houses, he said, do
not have many bills to offer the Bank, because commercial banks are no
longer obliged to deposit a minimum proportion of funds with the London
discount market.
As a result of the shortage, the overnight rate opened yesterday at 18 per
cent, with 1 month money offered 1 3/8 per cent above base rate.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.8bn in the morning. But,
to the surprise of some players, Pounds 1.3bn of bills were sold to the Bank
in the early round.
One commercial bank dealer suggested that the bills had been offered by a UK
clearing bank which wanted to get the short-dated rates down to manage its
book. The bank could have 'locked itself in' to lending money at 9 7/8 per
cent in the morning, later borrowing money on the interbank market as the
rate dropped to 8 3/4 per cent.
The move helped to push short-dated rates down. Three-month money closed at
7 3/4 per cent offered, down  1/4 per cent on the day. The December short
sterling contract, which hit a low of 93.25 before the early round in the
cash market, rose to a close of 93.36 at the end of trading. Strictly
speaking, this assumes that 3-month money will be trading at 6 1/2 per cent
by Christmas.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar volatile against DM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR zig-zagged against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday,
staging another rally against the German currency in Thursday's Asian
trading but slipping in Europe as dealers took short-term profits, writes
James Blitz.
The D-Mark was stronger against the dollar and European currencies on
Wednesday after the Bundesbank engineered a smaller cut in money market
rates than expected. However, traders pushed the dollar up to a high of
DM1.5250 in Asia overnight, partly reacting to rumours that Mr Boris Yeltsin
was planning to resign as President of Russia.
Yesterday morning, this move was reversed and the dollar moved back to a low
of DM1.5035 in Europe. Mr Robert Parry, President of the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, helped the currency down by saying that the Fed could
ease interest rates again because of the sluggishness of the US economy. The
dollar closed at DM1.5100 against the D-Mark, up nearly a pfennig.
There were signs yesterday that the market is still unsure when the dollar
will stage a fundamental rally against the D-Mark. The market did not
respond to a surprisingly upbeat set of jobless data, with claims for the
week to October 10 falling to 368,000 from 383,000.
However, Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, said
that the market remains fundamentally bullish about the US currency. 'There
is pent-up demand for dollars,' he said, claiming that the majority of
potential dollar buyers have still not come into the market yet. He believes
that a break through DM1.53 would see more substantial investor interest.
Sterling rose against the D-Mark in Asia, partly buoyed by the dollar's
rise, but mostly helped by the House of Commons' decision to support the UK
government in a vote on the closure of the UK coal mines. The pound closed
at DM2.4500 against the D-Mark, up nearly two pfennigs.
Sterling's moves are increasingly difficult to assess because the UK
authorities are increasingly committed to cutting interest rates, paying
less heed to the exchange rate. Mr Ian Beauchamp, chief economist at Hambros
Bank in London, says that the only way of judging it is by its trade
weighted value, which he puts at DM2.55. 'When it is below that, we have to
assess how bad Britain's political situation is, and, right now, it is very
bad,' he said.
Fears that today's European Monetary Committee meeting in Berlin heralds a
realignment of the European exchange mechanism continued to evaporate
yesterday, and most European currencies looked firmer against the D-Mark.
The Italian lira closed at L877.6 against the D-Mark from a previous L879.6.

AEROPORTS de Paris, which runs the Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports, has
recovered from the disruption caused by the Gulf War and more than doubled
net profits in the first half of the year.
During the first half of last year the Paris airports, like those in other
capitals, were badly hit by the dramatic decline in air travel for the
duration of the war.
However, the market has since recovered and, despite the economic slowdown,
which has had a strong effect on business travel, Aeroports de Paris managed
to increase net profits by 138 per cent to FFr215.1m (Dollars 42m) in the
first six months of 1992.
The number of passengers using its airports rose by 5.1 per cent overall
compared with 1990, the year before the Gulf War. However, this reflects a
sharp increase of 9.7 per cent in international passenger traffic and a
decline of 2 per cent in the domestic market.
Paris is one of the few European capital cities to have experienced an
increase in international tourism this year, partly because of the opening
of the EuroDisneyland theme park in April.
Aeroports de Paris saw turnover rise by 17.2 per cent from FFr2.37bn to
FFr2.78bn in the interim period while operating profits shot up by 50 per
cent from FFr330.8m to FFr495.5m.

<TEXT>
LEIF HOEGH, one of Norway's biggest shipowners, suffered a slide in
nine-month profits to NKr135m (Dollars 22m) from NKr454m in the same period
last year. The result stemmed from a weak dollar and poor markets for
tankers and dry bulk carriers.
The performance was far below average analysts' forecasts of a profit of
around NKr200m, but the group said it was satisfactory in light of
prevailing market conditions.
Freight income in the first nine months of this year fell by NKr125m to
NKr1.58bn as operating expenses rose by NKr86m to NKr362m. Last year's
comparative figure for profits included a NKr154m gain on the sales of ships
but no gains were registered during this year.
Leif Hoegh forecast operating profit for the year to reach NKr300m,
substantially down from NKr694m in 1991.
Vard, the Norwegian cruise-ship and ferry owner, saw losses for nine months
fall to NKr8.6m (Dollars 1.4m) from NKr62.6m last year, helped mainly by
growth in ferry traffic and a decline in operating expenses. Group operating
revenue remained steady at NKr4.113bn compared with NKr4.114bn last year.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cheap steel imports push Usinor
Sacilor into loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
USINOR SACILOR, the world's second largest steelmaker, yesterday announced a
sharp swing to a FFrs360m (Dollars 70.5) net loss in the first half of the
year, which it blamed on weak demand and a fall in prices, worsened by
'massive' cheap imports from eastern and central Europe.
The French state-owned group complained that the European Community market
was being swamped by imported steel at prices 'incompatible with the rules
of fair competition'.
To make matters worse, the devaluations of the British, Spanish and Italian
currencies forced Usinor Sacilor to slash its margins in those markets to
compete against the lower prices offered by local producers. The group said
net losses in the current half were set to be 'very distinctly' worse than
in the first six months.
The loss, which followed a FFr3.1bn deficit in 1991, the first for four
years, compares with a FFr875m profit in the first six months of last year.
Interim sales fell by 6.5 per cent to FFr48.11bn from FFr51.44bn. Operating
profits dwindled to FFr144m from FFr1.09bn.
Flat products, like steel sheet for the motor industry, were profitable, as
were engineering steels and stainless products. But there were losses in
long products, like beams and wire for the construction industry. Usinor
Sacilor was running down stocks and cutting back on working capital in an
attempt to adjust.
The company said the outlook was gloomy. Demand had fallen sharply in the
current half, driving prices down.
Like several other European steelmakers, the group has cut production in
line with the fall in demand. This has centred on Sollac, the flat products
unit, which is to trim output by 20 per cent over the final quarter,
compared to the same period of last year.
Usinor Sacilor is in the forefront of attempts by Eurofer, the EC steel
industry grouping, to obtain European Commission help for 'improved
functioning of the internal and external market'. Among others, the company
wants more help from the commission in attacking the recent rise in US steel
import duties.

verdict

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN bank creditors to Efim, the Italian state holding company put into
liquidation in August, will today give a preliminary judgment on the
government's plan to repay all the debts of the group and its wholly-owned
subsidiaries.
Though welcomed in principle, bankers have expressed caution ahead of
details of the government's proposals. Though some had hoped to find fuller
information in the decree published earlier this week, it shed little light
on how creditors will be treated.
'In principle, it's a good thing,' said Mr Guido Rosa, the chairman of the
foreign banks' association in Italy. 'But there are so many things yet to be
defined that all options are open.'
Bankers want to know how much of Efim's debts the government intends to
repay in cash. They would also like to know how the remainder, probably in
the form of bonds, will be paid. An earlier proposal to offer bank creditors
lira and Ecu bonds at interest rates well below market rates aroused
protests.
'We want to know what sort of bonds the government will issue, the interest
rates and maturities,' said one banker. 'And many lenders are concerned
about the treatment of loans to subsidiaries of Efim, like the Agusta
helicopters group, which are not 100 per cent owned by the parent company.'
Bankers will be able to discuss the matter at a November 3 meeting with Mr
Alberto Predieri, the special administrator running Efim.
Further information could emerge around mid-month, when the government is
expected to disclose how the group will be restructured, while the treasury
itself may also issue further technical details on the treatment of
creditors.
The government has already revealed preliminary plans to break up Efim's
industrial activities. Siv, its big glass making subsidiary, is to be
auctioned. The company could interest a number of Europe's leading glass
producers.
Efim's aerospace and defence businesses, concentrated in Agusta and Oto
Melara respectively, will be transferred to the IRI state holding company on
a fiduciary basis, pending an eventual sale. The two companies, whose debts
will be assumed by the government, are likely to come under the wing of
Finmeccanica.

<TEXT>
SANDOZ, the Swiss chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, reported a 9 per cent
increase in sales to SFr11bn (Dollars 8bn) for the first nine months to
September 30. The result benefitted from favourable currency movements.
The sales increase was satisfactory given the recessionary pressures, the
turbulence of the European monetary system and the dollar's weakness, the
company said.
The group expects an increase in profits for the first nine months because
of innovative products and strict cost management.
Mr Raymond Breu, group treasurer, said staff levels would continue to fall
at the Basel headquarters. Hundreds of jobs have already been cut in the
chemicals division.
The pharmaceuticals and nutrition divisions' manufacturing operations in
Europe were being rationalised, said Mr Breu. A plant was being built in
Ireland which has a favourable tax regime. Some European nutrition plants
could also be shut, he added.
All divisions improved their revenues. The largest, pharmaceuticals,
increased sales 10 per cent from SFr4.69bn to SFr5.17bn. The group said the
growth of its new drugs Lamisil, an anti-fungal, Sandostatin, a cancer
treatment, and Lomir, a blood pressure medicine, had been particularly
gratifying.
The nutrition business, which includes Ovaltine and Wasa crispbread,
increased sales by 20 per cent from SFr1.12bn to SFr1.35bn.
The chemicals division increased sales 5 per cent from SFr1.78bn to
SFr1.87bn in spite of difficult market conditions, said the company.
Agrochemicals increased sales 2 per cent from SFr949m to SFr970m, although
in local currencies there was a 1 per cent decline. Seeds increased 9 per
cent from SFr801m to SFr876m.

SCA, Sweden's second largest forestry group, experienced a sharp slump in

Earnings after financial items fell 96 per cent to SKr62m (Dollars 11m) from
SKr1.54bn a year earlier, as sales slid to SKr21.1bn from SKr22.2bn.
Restructuring inflated earnings in the first eight months of 1991 by
SKr501m.
Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, SCA chief executive, said prices for sawn timber,
pulp, linerboard and paper were 'exceptionally low'. The impact was
exacerbated by Finland's November 1991 markka devaluation.

<TEXT>
DASSAULT Aviation, the French fighter aircraft and business jet group,
suffered a sharp fall in profits during the first half of this year.
The company reported a fall in net profits of 43 per cent from FFr193.8m in
the first six months of 1991 to FFr111.1m (Dollars 21.7m) in the same period
of 1992 on sales which rose by 4.1 per cent to FFr6.48bn.
Dassault has sustained a sharp contraction in turnover since 1990, when it
made sales of FFr16.7bn in the full financial year. Its turnover fell to
FFr14.35bn last year and, according to the company, should rise to around
FFr15bn this year.
Mr Serge Dassault, chairman, recently announced that the group had secured
orders with a value equivalent to three years' revenue. Dassault yesterday
confirmed that the orders received in the first half of the year were worth
FFr5.29bn.
However, the company said that it did not expect the flow of orders to
continue at the same pace in the second half. Dassault has invested heavily
in two long term projects - the Rafale aircraft designed for naval and
ground attack and the Falcon 2000 business jet. Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the
pharmaceuticals subsidiary of the Rhone-Poulenc chemicals group, saw net
profits rise by 29 per cent from Dollars 201.9m to Dollars 261m in the first
three quarters of the year. This has fuelled an increase in earnings per
share from Dollars 79.9 to Dollars 90.6 over the same period.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: DAF defers preference dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAF, the Dutch commercial vehicle maker in which British Aerospace has a 16
per cent stake, is deferring payment of a dividend in 1992 on its
convertible cumulative preference shares.
The move, announced yesterday, caused a sharp drop in the heavily
loss-making group's share price which hit an all-time low, with the ordinary
shares falling 14.8 per cent to Fl 11.5 from Fl 13.5, while the preference
share price dropped 13 per cent to Fl 12.
DAF said yesterday that the management board believed that it was 'not in
the interests of the company to make a dividend payment at present in view
of today's circumstances'. The dividend was due to be paid on November 1.
The company raised Fl 250m (Dollars 132m) through an issue of convertible
preference shares in September last year to bolster its battered balance
sheet.
The preference shares are supposed to pay a cumulative dividend of 10.5 per
cent per year and must be converted into DAF ordinary shares in four
instalments from June 1, 1995 to June 1, 1998.
DAF is in its third year of heavy losses in the face of the steep recession
in the commercial vehicle industry in the UK, its most important market.
It cut its net loss significantly in the first half of the year, however, to
Fl 97.4m from Fl 179.1m in the corresponding period a year ago.
DAF is still holding talks on forming a 'strategic alliance' with
Mercedes-Benz, the world's leading truck maker, including the possibility of
the German group taking an equity stake, while at the same time it is
seeking additional loan funding of Fl 210m in credits backed by the Dutch
and Belgian governments.

WOULD THE second world war have happened in a different way and with
different consequences if an 18-year-old Winston Churchill had not fallen
out of a tree?
In 1893, Churchill was playing with some friends in Branksome Dene Chine, in
Poole. There was a wooden bridge, at treetop height, across the chine.
Churchill decided to jump from the bridge to the top of a tree, and then
climb down the tree to the bottom of the chine. Instead, he slipped and fell
almost 30 feet, knocking himself unconscious, rupturing a kidney and
breaking a shoulder.
While he was convalescing he spent a lot of time at the House of Commons,
became fascinated with political life, and resolved to become an MP. If he
had not fallen out of a tree, would he have entered politics and become
prime minister?
What do incidents like this have to do with a portfolio of investments? They
help to show why economists are so often wrong. You cannot predict the
unpredictable.
Economic models can point to possibilities - but it is people who make
things happen. Even a few, determined people, can bring about dramatic
changes, either within a country or within a company. An understanding of
people's behaviour and an absorption of 'sentiment' can often be a better
predictor of events (including share prices) than economic models. But even
this can be overturned by unexpected events. The period between now and the
new year seems to be full of unpredictables, and this has a bearing on
investment strategy.
The British government has problems with the EC. The British economy shows
few signs of revival. In Germany there are enormous problems with racial
unrest and the unfulfilled expectations of the east Germans.
In the countries that used to be the USSR, there are so many problems that
it will take strong and determined action to resolve them.
In circumstances like these, what do I do with this portfolio? It is one
year since, with some trepidation, I started with a notional Pounds 10,000
to 'invest'. That has now grown to Pounds 15,328 - a rise of more than 50
per cent in 12 months. The portfolio was considerably helped by the takeover
of its investment in Taveners by Toms Fabrikker, a Danish chocolate and
confectioner manufacturer. This turned an investment of Pounds 2,450 into
cash of Pounds 5,985.
Its investment in Pentland Group, where the shares have outperformed the
market, also helped the portfolio, which received a dividend from that
company of 1.3125p per share.
High interest rates on cash deposits have also helped. The only black spot
has been its investment in Gestetner, where 1,500 shares, purchased at 183p
each, were sold for 132p each when I became concerned that Gestetner's
turnround (or takeover by Ricoh, its recent large investor) appeared to be
taking longer than I had hoped. I still feel that Gestetner is a reasonable
investment, taking a five-year view, but in current circumstances the
portfolio errs on the side of caution and prefers cash and other
investments.
In the summer Quarterly Review, I stated that the portfolio would consider
buying 1,000 shares in Fisons if they fell to around 175-185p and looked as
if they would not fall much further. Having correctly anticipated Fisons'
sharp falls earlier this year, but believing the company is basically sound,
when the shares reached 168p on August 28 the portfolio made its purchase.
This is still a high-risk investment. If the shares fall to 130p and appear
to be on a continuing downward path, then they will be sold. I hope,
however, that Fisons' plans to sell its horticultural interests will be
successful and a good price obtained, or that a much speculated takeover bid
may occur for the whole of Fisons.
With the September devaluation of the pound, Fisons' prospects ought to have
improved.
The portfolio will retain its shareholding in Pentland, despite its decision
not to proceed with the planned acquisition of Adidas sportswear. This
demonstrated the company's excellent reputation for caution, and Pentland
will benefit from a Pounds 20m foreign exchange profit on the aborted deal.
The continuing development of Speedo swimwear and Pentland's other interests
ought to make this company a good long-term investment. However, if Pentland
shares fell to 105p and looked as if a general market downturn would take
them lower, then the shares would be sold. (My own personal pension scheme
has a modest shareholding in Pentland).
Now, I have to consider what to do with the portfolio's remaining cash
holdings.
I asked a friend who works for a major international banking and
stockbroking firm what he is currently advising. He said: 'The quick profits
of the past are no longer to be anticipated. Rather than seeking profits,
people should be looking to conserve their wealth. It is all too easy to
lose money now.'
I tend to agree with him; but, as the portfolio has done so well so far, I
thought it ought to engage in a highly speculative gamble. Even if the
gamble does not work, at least the portfolio will not have lost all its
earlier gains.
The portfolio will risk Pounds 920 by buying 8,000 shares, at 11.5p each, in
a very small company, Burlington Group. It has a market capitalisation of
less than Pounds 2m. (My personal pension scheme has held shares in this
company since May 1989, when it was known as Gold and Base Metal Mines, but
has steadily increased its shareholding - still very modest - over the years
as the company sold its investments in overseas mining shares).
In his August 18 interim statement, the chairman of Burlington pointed out
that the company's 'portfolio retains substantial cash deposits and
short-dated gilt-edged investments . . . we will maintain a high liquidity
ratio.' The interim statement also revealed net assets per share of 17.52p
and after-tax profits for the six-month period of Pounds 41,500.
Burlington would seem to be ideal for someone wanting a company for a
reverse takeover, rather than risk the uncertainties and costs of a new
flotation. However, the shares should not be chased too far, as, in the
past, they have tended to rise and fall rapidly. For example, even this year
they have ranged between 7.5p and 14.5p.
The portfolio will also keep an eye on Allied Colloids. This appears to be a
very well-managed company engaged in the manufacture and sale of speciality
industrial chemicals. Pre-tax profits for the year ended March 28, 1992,
were Pounds 42.1m - an increase over the previous year of Pounds 3.2m. On
turnover of Pounds 254.5m, only Pounds 40.8m was in the UK. The rest was
overseas, so it should benefit from a devalued pound.
This year, the company's shares have traded in the 162p-220p range. If the
shares fell to around 170-180p, the portfolio would consider buying 1,000,
provided the economic situation did not look as if further sharp downturns
in markets were about to occur.
Thus, the portfolio maintains a fairly cautious approach, has a reasonable
amount of cash and has set limits at which it can divest itself of certain
investments before any catastrophic losses occur.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: Lord
Justice Bingham completes 11 month inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD JUSTICE BINGHAM completed his 11-month inquiry into BCCI this summer
shortly before being appointed as Master of the Rolls, the most senior civil
court judge in England and Wales. Sir Thomas Bingham, 59, is regarded as
having one of the best intellects on the bench. Those he interviewed for the
inquiry describe him as personable but rigorous.
The only son of two doctors, he was educated at Sedbergh and Balliol
College, Oxford. He was called to the Bar in 1959 and rapidly earned a
reputation as one of the brightest commercial lawyers of his generation and
a brilliant advocate. He was appointed to the High Court bench in 1980 and
to the Court of Appeal in 1986.
In 1977 he was appointed to head the inquiry into Rhodesia sanctions-busting
by UK oil companies. In 1989 he was the first judge to speak out strongly in
favour of the Lord Chancellor's proposed reforms of the legal profession.

Luxembourg agrees Dollars 1.7bn payout plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A LUXEMBOURG court yest-erday approved the Dollars 1.7bn compensation plan
worked out by BCCI's liquidators and the Abu Dhabi majority shareholders.
Assuming creditors do not appeal against the decision, the judgment clears
the way for compensation payments to begin next year.
Mrs Maryse Welter, the principal judge in a three-person tribunal, said
yesterday that creditors who objected to the plan had not come up with a
credible alternative. Separate legal action against Abu Dhabi would be 'long
and costly', and the result uncertain.
She authorised the liquidators to sign the Dollars 1.7bn 'contribution
agreement' with Abu Dhabi, and the 'pooling agreement', which would pool the
proceeds from liquidation of BCCI's various operations.
Courts in the UK and in the Cayman Islands sanctioned the deal earlier this
year. But the court in Luxembourg, where BCCI had its brass-plate
headquarters, demanded more information from liquidators and the majority
shareholders before taking a decision. The first court hearing was in June.
Mr Julien Roden, one of the Luxembourg liquidators, said after yesterday's
formal judgment that he believed the plan was in the best interests of all
creditors and an appeal would be counter-productive. 'If an appeal is made,
then the whole story of payments to the creditors will be postponed for
months and months,' he said.
In a ballot on the package, conducted at the Luxembourg court's request over
the summer, the scheme received the backing of about 90 per cent of
creditors who voted. The Luxembourg judge said that had been a deciding
factor in the court's decision to approve the package.
Certain creditors had maintained their opposition to the plan, arguing that
the court should consider the damning US report on the bank's collapse by
Senator John Kerry and the UK report published yesterday by Lord Justice
Bingham. But the court decided not to take the reports into account.
Once the agreement between Abu Dhabi and the liquidators is signed,
creditors will be asked to prove their debt and to waive all further legal
claims against Abu Dhabi.
Mr Roden said yesterday that the liquidators hoped to recover 'a dividend'
of 30 per cent-40 per cent for creditors. He warned that liquidation would
be slow, taking at least three or four years.
He said that the first tranche of payments, based on the compensation
scheme, should be paid by the middle of next year. Further payments would be
made each time a further 5 per cent dividend was realised from the
liquidation.

on Major rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont, the chancellor, told MPs yesterday that he would
vigorously pursue all the recommendations made by Lord Justice Bingham in
his report into Bank of Credit and Commerce International, which was closed
by the Bank of England in July last year.
Mr Lamont leapt to the defence of Mr John Major, the prime minister, and
other Treasury ministers past and present over their role in the supervision
of BCCI before its closure.
Claims by Mr Gordon Brown, shadow chancellor, that Mr Major must accept a
share of the blame for the BCCI debacle were 'absolutely disgraceful', Mr
Lamont said. The report made it 'quite clear', he added, that the conduct of
Treasury ministers including Mr Major was 'not open to criticism in any
respect'.
Labour should accept that the real responsibility for what had happened lay
with the criminals who 'perpetrated the fraud', rather than seeking 'to get
whatever miserable political advantage they can out of this'.
Mr Lamont also defended the conduct of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Bank
governor, in the face of repeated Labour calls for him to resign. 'I do not
believe it would be right to call for the resignation of the governor of the
Bank of England,' he said, adding that he had 'every confidence' in him.
Repeatedly questioned on the subject of compensation for BCCI depositors, Mr
Lamont offered no additional help over and above that provided by existing
schemes. He said that Pounds 50m in compensation had already been paid to
9,000 people out of a figure of up to Pounds 85m that could be paid out.
'I do not believe we should have a system of 100 per cent compensation,' he
added. He sought to differentiate the position of BCCI depositors from those
affected by the Barlow Clowes collapse on the grounds that, in the case of
Barlow Clowes, no relevant compensation scheme was in existence.
Mr Lamont was also dismissive of the recent US report into BCCI published by
Senator John Kerry, saying that he did not accept its findings. The document
made 'some wild allegations which were incorrect'.
Mr Brown focused his remarks on the question of responsibility, asking
whether it was 'right that junior Bank of England officials should alone
shoulder the blame'.
Mr Lamont should accept that Mr Leigh-Pemberton's statement in April last
year that BCCI was in pretty good shape constituted 'something of a
misjudgment'. Far from the Treasury being uninformed, they knew full well
that there was a problem and chose to do nothing more.
The refrain was echoed by Mr Alistair Darling, a Labour Treasury spokesman,
who said that 'many people think it is high time that those who took
decisions must stand up and take responsibility when things go wrong'.
Mr Keith Vaz, Labour environment spokesman who has campaigned on behalf of
BCCI depositors, was among those to demand Mr Leigh-Pemberton's replacement.
Mr Vaz told Mr Lamont: 'The credibility of the governor of the Bank is no
more. He should apologise for what has happened and you should sack him.'
A series of written questions tabled by Mr Vaz later elicited the
information that the 'total direct costs' of Lord Justice Bingham and his
inquiry team had amounted so far to Pounds 595,000.
Mr Brian Sedgemore, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, asked
whether Mr Leigh-Pemberton stood 'outside the laws of England'.
In an early-day motion, Mr Sedgemore had suggested that a Serious Fraud
Office inquiry into allegations of corruption concerning Bank employees
related to BCCI may have been prematurely wound up 'for political reasons'.
Addressing the difficulty of international supervision of banks, Mr Terence
Higgins, former Tory chairman of the all-party Treasury and Civil Service
committee which published its own BCCI report earlier this year, said it was
essential to have 'someone to regulate the regulators'.

Appointed men are no strangers to regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEITHER Mr Ian Watt, the man named to head the Bank of England's new special
investigations unit, nor Mr Peter Peddie, the head of the new specialised
legal unit, is a newcomer to the regulatory scene, Norma Cohen writes.
Mr Watt, 59, a partner at KPMG Peat Marwick, has made investigation work and
liquidations his specialty. In 1971 he was a joint liquidator of
Rolls-Royce, while in 1982 he became the Department of Trade and Industry's
investigator into insurance broker Alexander Howden. In 1986 he headed the
DTI's investiga-tion into the share-support operation surrounding Guinness.
Most recently he was one of the joint liquidators to parts of Drexel Burnham
Lambert, the US-based investment bank which collapsed along with the
so-called junk bond market.
Mr Peddie, 60, who recently retired as a partner at Freshfields, the City
law firm, has been involved in work for the Bank since 1975. He has been a
member of the Law Society's committee on company law for the past 20 years.
Mr Watt, who was one of the assessors to Lord Bingham's enquiry, said he
feels his primary role is 'to help banking supervisors develop some antennae
for smelling out fraud' rather than to mastermind a radical overhaul of the
supervisory process. 'There is an overriding need for the regulators to
identify the suspect banks and show their willingness to deal with them
firmly,' he said.
He said that among the early warning signs which ought to alert bank
supervisors are corporate re-organisations that place key parts of a bank in
geographic locations not easily reached by regulators. Also, the existence
of large loans to a handful of organisations or a sudden shift of auditors
ought to alert regulators.
Mr Watt said he would also increase the use of outside expertise such as
audit firms by the Bank and step up communication with other supervisory
bodies.
Mr Watt will report directly to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the
Bank, and Mr Eddie George, deputy governor.
Mr Peddie will have direct access to both men but on a daily basis will
report to the director of banking supervision and the director of money
market supervision. 'I see my task as bringing a legal focus to supervisory
issues,' said Mr Peddie.
Critical to their effectiveness, both men say, are proposals outlined by the
chancellor to make it easier for regulatory bodies to share information with
each other and for punitive measures that the Bankcan take short of the
so-called 'nuclear option' of closing a bank down.

investigators support criticism

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS investigating the BCCI affair were cautious in their reactions
to the Bingham report yesterday but generally agreed with criticism of the
Bank of England, Price Waterhouse and Abu Dhabi.
Mr Jonathan Winer, an aide to Mr John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat
senator who released his own BCCI report earlier this month, said the
Bingham conclusions appeared to be 'consistent with our own report'.
Mr Winer said the underlying problem was 'that the rules governing bank
regulation and the international movement of capital need to be reviewed in
order to make sure there is not a repetition of BCCI'.
The Senate BCCI investigator pointed to a danger underscored by the Bingham
report that 'national boundaries are readily permeable'. Mr Winer said that
without greater transparency, as well as co-operation among regulators in
the leading industrialised countries, 'we will continue to be vulnerable'.
The Kerry report used harsh language to criticise the Bank, and Mr Kerry
even said that the Bank had effectively covered up the BCCI affair by not
acting in 1990 when it received initial indications of the fraud. The Bank
rejected Mr Kerry's conclusions.
Three weeks ago Mr Kerry also disclosed that Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority
shareholder, was the target of an investigation by the office of Mr Robert
Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney.
In New York Mr John Moscow, the assistant district attorney who has
spearheaded the Morgenthau BCCI investigation, said the Bingham report
showed that electronic funds transfer technology 'may be defeating
regulators'. He said a new generation of regulators or a new philosophy
would be needed in order to tackle the problems posed by such technology.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal:
Governor outlines stronger measures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, made this
statement yesterday in response to the Bingham report:
'Lord Justice Bingham has made some significant criticisms of the Bank's
supervisory approach and draws attention to a number of very important
lessons to be learned. I have announced today a series of important changes
in the Bank which will strengthen our supervision in the future, and
especially our approach to fraudulent or criminal activity.
'The changes include the appointment of Ian Watt, a distinguished and
experienced accountant, to head a new special investigations unit at the
Bank; this will pursue any suggestion of fraud or criminality and ensure
that necessary action is taken either by the Bank or by other authorities.
'They include the appointment of Peter Peddie, who has great experience of
the City and the Bank, to head a new legal unit to make sure that the Bank
uses its Banking Act and other powers to the full.
'They include measures to make the contribution of the Board of Banking
Supervision even more effective.
'And they include strengthening of communications within the Bank and
between the Bank and government.
'I believe our supervision will benefit greatly from these measures, taken
together with the new minimum standards for international supervision agreed
earlier this year in the Basle committee, and the measures announced by the
chancellor to strengthen our Banking Act powers and to create new
inter-departmental ma-chinery for the investigation and pursuit of fraud.
'I am conscious of the acute distress that the fraud in BCCI has caused to
thousands of innocent depositors and businessmen. The scale of the fraud was
unique and was concealed from auditors and supervisors around the world for
many years. No supervisor, however alert and sophisticated, can give an
assurance that fraudulent conduct will never occur, or that people will not
lose money because of it. Our objective is to make such frauds increasingly
difficult to perpetrate and to conceal.
'Our supervisors do an exceptionally difficult job, in circumstances where
their successes are necessarily unseen, and I am pleased that Lord Justice
Bingham has commended the professionalism with which the UK region of BCCI
was supervised by the Bank.
'There have been many cases where our supervisors have played a crucial role
in successfully protecting depositors by ensuring that banks maintain
prudent standards, by identifying and dealing with weaknesses before they
be-come a serious threat, and by programmes of remedial action.
'The general record is good, and I believe that Lord Justice Bingham is
right in saying that the present system of supervision has served the
community well. I want our supervisors to have the resources, training and
above all the support they need to do this difficult but critical job. That
is why Lord Justice Bingham's recommendations are so important, and why we
are implementing them in full.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bingham Report - Investigation into the BCCI scandal: The
main recommendations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Call for exercise of informed judgment
Lord Justice Bingham concludes that the BCCI shutdown should not lead to
greatly intensified supervision of all banks, or to the substitution of a
code of detailed rules for 'the exercise of informed judgment'.
He does not recommend 'any radical recasting' of bank supervision.
Supervision ultimately relies on the 'skill, alertness, experience and
vigour' of supervisors, but he makes a number of detailed suggestions to
strengthen it:
UK banking supervision
The Bank of England's board of banking supervision lacked important
information needed to fulfil its role over BCCI. The board's members should
be alerted to 'any fact which even might cause their antennae to twitch'.
The Bank's traditional techniques of supervision based on trust, frankness
and a willingness to co-operate 'on the whole have served the community
well'. But the Bank needs to be alert to the possibility of fraud, astute in
recognising it, and active in investigating it.
The Bank should establish a trained and qualified special investigations
unit within the supervision division to consider all warnings and suspicions
of malpractice, and ensure that they are investigated effectively.
The Bank should take steps to strengthen its internal communications, which
were exposed by the inquiry as 'a significant weakness'.
The Bank should strengthen its legal unit following the BCCI affair. The
main value of such a unit is not to warn supervisors of what they cannot
lawfully do, but to ensure they are aware of the full extent of their powers
under the law.
The Bank has powers to refuse or revoke authorisation on the grounds that a
bank cannot be effectively supervised, and to make banks locate their head
offices in the country of authorisation. If its hand would be strengthened
by a change in law, this should be done.
European Community
The principles that European Community states should stop supervisory
'forum-shopping', that a bank's place of incorporation is treated as its
home, and that head offices should be in the same state as registered
offices should be articles of the Second Banking Co-ordination Directive.
The directive should explicitly confer on EC states the right to refuse or
withdraw banking supervision in the case of bank structures considered
inappropriate for bodies carrying out banking activities.
There should be an EC directive establishing a banking deposit guarantee
scheme in all member states, and imposing the guarantee obligation in
respect of qualifying liabilities in member states other than the bank's
home state.
International supervision
There should be some form of international monitoring of supervisory
standards, possibly by the Bank for International Settlements.
Whenever a 'financial centre that offers impenetrable secrecy' is involved
in the affairs of a bank, that should be sufficient reason for any
supervisor to refuse or revoke authorisation.
Disclosure
There should be a UK review of the circumstances under which bodies
discharging public functions should be allowed or required to pass
information about a bank's activities to each other and to regulatory
authorities.
There should be an international database listing those whom a supervisor
has found to be not fit and proper to be a director, manager or controller
of a bank.
Auditors' duties
Auditors should have a legal duty to report to the Bank anything they know
to be relevant to a bank's fulfilment of criteria in the 1987 Banking Act.
They should also have a duty to provide information reasonably requested by
the Bank for supervisory purposes.
All companies in a banking group should have the same accounting dates.
A report covering all aspects of accounting and annual controls should be
commissioned annually from the reporting accountant of a bank incorporated
outside the UK, rather than every four or five years as at present.
The Bank should consider introducing checks and remedies to prevent
organisations under the common control of banking groups from having
opportunities for fraud and manipulation.
The Bank should have the power to require a separate audit of banks
domiciled outside the EC.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (27):  A vehicle for
expatriates, rather than stay-at-homes - Offshore Funds, A resident,
domiciled Briton is liable for tax on his worldwide income wherever it
arises. The Inland Revenue does not care whether the fund is based in London
or Luxembourg / Survey of Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN

<TEXT>
OFFSHORE FUNDS have a rather mixed image in the UK. There is a general
perception of (ill-defined) tax benefits for investors; but also an
impression of risk, probably created by the Barlow Clowes affair.
In theory, however, offshore funds are the product of the future. In 1989,
the European Community introduced legislation relating to Ucits
(Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities) - with
the aim of ensuring that the same fund can be sold across Europe, from
Fishguard to Frankfurt. Fund management companies dream of creating
billion-dollar funds by tapping the wealth of the rich of Europe.
To date, progress has been relatively modest. The main reason is that there
is no real salesforce available to market offshore funds, so that investors
have tended to stick with the domestic institutions they know. In Europe,
most investors tend to buy investment products from their domestic banks;
and even in the more open market of the UK, 'there are a limited number of
financial advisers who are registered to sell offshore funds', according to
Martin Harrison, of GT Management.
There is one ready market for offshore funds - expatriates. People working
abroad - a growing trend within the EC - can enjoy tax benefits from keeping
their savings outside their home country.
For resident British investors, however, the tax advantages of investing
offshore are rather limited. A resident and domiciled Briton is liable for
tax on his worldwide income, wherever it arises. The Revenue does not care
whether the fund is based in London or Luxembourg.
Offshore funds, unlike their onshore counterparts, can pay gross income to
their investors, but this apparent advantage can be somewhat illusory. The
funds themselves may have to pay withholding tax (a tax deducted at source)
on their income. In the case of a fund holding UK equities, a UK-based
investor might actually find himself at a tax disdvantage if he invested
offshore.
There may be a cashflow advantage for British investors from receiving gross
income from an offshore bond fund. Such funds frequently invest in Eurobonds
and the like, which are not subject to witholding tax.
Just mentioning the words 'offshore' and 'bonds' in the same breath fund
inevitably conjures up the image of Barlow Clowes. The good news is that
there has been some tightening in investor protection since the mid-1980s.
Some countries - Bermuda, Guernsey, Isle of Man and Jersey - have investor
compensation schemes; others (Canada, Ireland, Luxembourg and Switzerland)
have 'SIB recognised' local regulation.
The offshore market does have some non-tax appeal to investors. The first is
that many funds use single pricing, which is a lot easier for the investor
to understand than the complicated mix of bid, offer and cancellation prices
that afflicts the unit trust market.
The second is the umbrella-fund structure which many management groups have
established. Initially these structures had capital gains tax advantages
(which have now been removed), but they still allow for relatively easy
switching between funds.
Fidelity International launched an umbrella range of Ucits in 1990 in the
teeth of the Gulf crisis. Barry Bateman, managing director of Fidelity, says
the range has consistently grown, gaining about Dollars 150m of funds since
launch. The company has concentrated on Germany and Austria and has recently
started advertising direct to the retail investor.
Lewis McNaught, of Gartmore, says that his group's umbrella fund has so far
been sold to investors in 79 different countries although 60 per cent of the
money derives from UK holders.
When all is said and done, most investors will only be attracted to the
sector if they believe that investment performance is superior. However,
comparisons are difficult. In many cases, the sectors do not exactly
correspond. For example, Finstat has one UK equity sector for offshore
funds, which is the rough equivalent of four onshore sectors (growth,
general, smaller companies and equity income).
A further problem is that offshore fund performance figures are quoted on an
offer-to-offer basis. This makes sense because of the use of single pricing,
but does not allow for the initial charge, which the investor pays
separately. Onshore funds are quoted on an offer-to-bid basis, which allows
for the effect of the initial charge. The result is to give a 6 per cent or
so advantage to the performance figures of offshore funds.
Nevertheless, in those sectors where comparison is possible, offshore funds
come off quite well. Over the five years to September 1, the average
offshore gilt fund rose by 54.2 per cent, compared with 33 per cent for
onshore funds. North American offshore funds (up an avearge 5.8 per cent
over five years) also performed better than their onshore equivalents (down
3.1 per cent).
The day of the pan-European fund may yet come. But as the events of the
autumn have shown, the path to European integration is not smooth, and
cultural differences may delay the development of the offshore market.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (13): Where to
shelter if inflation returns - Remaining outside the ERM would have
implications for UK portfolios
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK MARKETS have faced more than their usual share of imponderables in the
past three months. But one question particularly exercising the minds of
many analysts is: 'What if the pound stays out of the exchange rate
mechanism and inflation returns?'
If inflation is coming back, then, for the private investor, the most
obvious move is into index-linked products. The simplest are index-linked
National Savings certificates, which guarantee to beat inflation by 4.5 per
cent if held for five years. If inflation should approach double figures
again, the returns on these certificates would dwarf the 6.75 per cent
available on the 39th issue fixed-rate certificates.
Index-linked gilts also have their attractions, although their yields
dropped sharply in the week following Black Wednesday, as bond-traders
decided to guard against inflation. Even large equity houses are now talking
about using index-linking for a substantial part of their funds, as a
bulwark against higher inflation.
International bond markets are also attracting attention from many advisers.
With German interest rates likely to come down next year, the argument is
that European bond prices will rise. Both the dollar and Yen also have
supporters.
This might explain why Richard Boyton, of the Boyton Group, would put
clients' money into offshore current funds, international bond funds, and
index-linked gilts. He comments: 'Interest rates worldwide will come down,
and I remain unconvinced that sterling will not sink lower against a basket
of currencies.'
The other traditional hedge against inflation lies in the equity markets.
The years of the squeeze on price rises have coincided with poor returns for
the markets. What factors would most help a company's shares?
Jonathan Powell, a director of Newton Investment Management, looks at the
implications of a permanent departure from the ERM. He said:
'We wouldn't be able to do what the Germans have done, so the other option
would be to do what the US is doing. That means lower interest rates, and
going for growth. If you do that, manufacturing is the winner. When you take
into account the currency factors, then that means, in particular,
manufacturing companies with overseas earnings, either exports or overseas
business.'
He points to Glaxo, BOC and Unilever as shares to watch in this scenario.
Other analysts agree that it is important to look for dollar-earners. Eric
Hathorn, director of research at Henderson Crosthwaite, also points to the
importance of 'defensive' qualities - companies with a relatively stable
core business, which will not be knocked too hard by renewed recession. That
leads to the large classic 'blue chip' international traders such as
Unilever, GEC and ICI.
So the prime sectors to look for are:
Pharmaceuticals
This sector includes several big 'international' stocks, such as Glaxo,
SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome. More important, it has recently been hit
hard by speculation in the US that Governor Bill Clinton will win the
presidential election, and then introduce strict price controls on drugs.
Several analysts believe that this speculation has been overdone, and that
there might now be a significant 'buying opportunity'. Mr Hathorn said: 'I
think it's unlikely Clinton would do that, and the prospects for that sector
remain brighter than most. Glaxo, in particular, has a strong range of new
development products.'
It is also, of course, the arch-defensive sector, because people continue to
fall ill and take medicine even in times of inflation.
Conglomerates
This is an untidy sector, which includes most of the companies that might be
expected to launch takeover bids, such as Hanson.
Mr Hathorn points out that the sector has been very quiet for a while, but
sentiment that the market is bouncing up, which would follow any return to
inflation, would make it much more likely for the conglomerates to start
making bids, before prices took off. Hanson's bid for Rank Hovis MacDougall,
at the beginning of this month, was cited as an example.
Other Industrial Materials
This awkwardly-named sector includes some companies which might normally be
thought of as conglomerates, such as BTR and Tomkins.
Oil &amp; Gas
Most of the companies in this sector are international earners. They also
benefit from recoveries in manufacturing. Thus the prospects for such as
Shell Trading &amp; Transport, or BP, should be healthy.
Are there any areas which should be specifically avoided? Unfortunately, the
names in this list include several sectors which have already endured
protracted underperformance:
Property, Building Materials and Contracting &amp; Construction
The three sectors most closely tied to the property market face continued
difficulty. As Mr Hathorn puts it: 'I am concerned that they are not going
to get the over-capacity clearing in a hurry. From the property angle,
there's far too much development property remaining unoccupied.'
Kenneth Levy, head of fund management at Capel-Cure Myers, points out that
construction companies enjoyed something of a 'bounce' in their share prices
before Black Wednesday, but he thinks a return to inflation would, in the
short-term, be very bad news for them. His strategy would be to avoid them,
and hedge by buying overseas earners.
Smaller Companies
Mr Levy says: 'In the short-term, you would have to be careful about smaller
companies.'
His reasoning is that a return of inflation would dampen any hopes of
interest rate cuts, and with it the possibility that small companies could
borrow cheaply.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (22):  Single
pricing would highlight those 'extras' - Charges, Changes are in the
pipeline, powered by the fund management industry and by regulation / Survey
of Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS

<TEXT>
COMPARED WITH other investment products, unit trust charges are relatively
easy to calculate. However, this is not necessarily an advantage.
Despite pressure from regulators, life assurance products - generally more
expensive than unit trusts - come with no obvious price tag. So unit trusts
can lose out in comparison.
The unit trust industry is therefore debating whether to make its products
even cheaper. Current unit trust pricing is tightly determined by legal
regulations.
Charges can usually be broken down as follows:
Bid-offer spread. This quaint piece of phraseology is borrowed from
share-dealing. It is intended to allow for the costs incurred by the unit
trust in trading.
The investor buys units at one price (the offer) and sells at another (the
bid). The difference between the two can vary substantially, but the average
is probably around 6 per cent. That means that, if you invest Pounds 1,000,
the immediate resale value of your holding is just Pounds 940.
The bid-offer spread reflects two underlying costs. Unit trust managers
invest in shares and face the bid-offer spread imposed by equity
marketmakers. They pass this cost on to investors via their pricing
mechanism.
The second and normally larger cost is the initial charge. This covers the
costs of setting up your investment, including administration, paperwork,
and the unit trust company's sales costs. A typical initial, or 'front-end',
charge would be 5 per cent, of which around 3 percentage points would
reflect the commission paid to the salesman or the independent financial
adviser. So out of a Pounds 1,000 investment, Pounds 10 might go on
share-dealing costs, Pounds 20 to the manager and Pounds 30 to the salesman.
There are ways of reducing this charge. If you approach the management
company direct, with a large enough sum, say Pounds 20,000, you may be able
to negotiate a smaller spread. And a fee-charging adviser should be able to
rebate commission, although a fee will be payable instead.
Management charges. These are ongoing, and are deducted from the value of
the fund each year. Again, they are expressed as a percentage of the fund,
typically 1 or 1.5 per cent, and are intended to pay for the management
costs - paying for research, software, and fund managers' salaries.
When you look at unit trust statistics, these will be quoted on an
'offer-to-bid' basis, so that they take fair account of the actual costs
faced by investors. Some companies quote figures on an offer-to-offer basis
 -so take care.
None of this seems simple (unless you have ever read an account of a life
office's charges). But significant changes are in the pipeline, powered both
by the fund management industry itself and by regulation.
Moves are afoot to allow single pricing. Funds would have only one price,
and any extra charges would, very visibly, need to be shown as an addition
to this. Those who want to invest the maximum in a unit trust personal
equity plan (Pep) already have the charges made clear to them; they pay the
maximum Pounds 6,000 plus, typically, the Pounds 360 of charges on top. This
could produce a powerful push towards cutting overall charges.
Regulations do not stop innovative methods of charging for unit trusts, if
held within a Pep. This has resulted in moves by Fidelity and then Gartmore,
who cut the front-end charges on their Peps from 5 per cent to 2 per cent.
However, investors who discontinue their Pep within a year pay 3 per cent
extra. This goes down to 2 per cent within two years, and 1 per cent within
three. After three years, there is no exit charge. The idea is to encourage
long-term investment.
Scottish Equitable has also done away with its 5 per cent front-end fee
altogether, and replaced it with a flat fee of Pounds 45 plus VAT - less
than 1 per cent for those who invest the maximum Pounds 6,000. However,
Scottish Equitable has introduced an extra 0.875 per cent annual charge,
which may help it reclaim some of its lost profits.
Will this lead to a price war? Robin Berrill, of Henderson Unit Trusts, is
adamant that it will not. His group has no intention of further cutting
front-end charges, and he says such a move could lead to many managers
leaving the industry. This could mean less competition for the consumer.
He is also angry that concentration on unit trust pricing has diverted
attention from the charges paid for life products, which are still in
general much higher.
But lower initial charges need not necessarily damage fund managers'
profits. More than half the charge goes straight to the salesman. And if the
perception of lower charges brings in more investors, managers can profit
from the effect of a larger annual management charge.
In February, Murray Johnstone, the Glasgow fund manager, slashed its
front-end charge from 6 per cent to 1 per cent (while increasing its annual
charge from 1 to 1.5 per cent). The effect on its business was dramatic - in
the year to June 1991, sales of Pounds 4.2m were out-balanced by Pounds
13.9m in repurchases. In the year to June this year, sales increased to
Pounds 15.2m, while repurchases dropped to Pounds 12.0m.
The problem lies with intermediaries - fund managers that adopt this
approach cut themselves off from most advisers, and must rely either on
direct investment from private investors, or on fee-charging advisers. Can
British fund managers distribute enough funds this way?
The experience in the US, where regulators allow much more varied charging
structures, is encouraging. While many mutual funds - the American
equivalent of unit trusts - are sold through insurance brokers and
representatives, with similar front-end charges to those levied here, there
is also a range of 'low load' funds. These have much lower front-end
charges, and are sold direct to the public, via press and other advertising.
Fidelity, the biggest fund manager in the US with funds under management of
Dollars 182bn, charges between 2 and 3 per cent front-end for equity funds,
with no initial charge at all for bond and money-market funds. An American
spokeswoman is quite clear about it: 'We charge less than 3 per cent, and
that's the way we've grown. We sell direct to the customer for the most
part, and we try to give the best value for the least cost. That's the theme
on which this company was built.'
However, the US market is much larger than the UK, and it is easier to
attract enough investors to make 'low load' and 'no load' funds profitable.
In the UK, Fidelity itself believes that the low-load route would be
impossible. It may even be that the move to lower charges is merely a
reflection of the desperate need of managers to drum up business.
But whatever the reason, a choice of charging structures can only be
excellent news for the consumer.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (26):  If you can't
beat the index, join it - Performance, Conventional fund managers' failure
to outperform explains the attraction of 'tracker funds' / Survey of Unit
Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE MOST important detail you need to know about a unit trust before you buy
it is, unfortunately, something that nobody can tell you - how it is going
to perform.
Unit trust performance statistics are complex, and can tell you which trusts
have performed best in the past. But nothing can tell you how well they will
do in the future.
Your best bet is to examine a trust's consistency. One that regularly
finishes in the top quartile (top 25 per cent) of a sector, without
necessarily setting the market alight, is probably a better bet than one
which occasionally tops the tables but at other times dips. This suggests
aggressive, possibly speculative, fund management. But nothing is certain.
It is even more difficult to work out what it is fair to expect from a
trust's performance. As a consumer, you will want to know how a trust can
measure up to rival fixed-interest products. Can a unit trust be relied upon
to beat a building society account, for example?
The performance of the last five years suggests that it cannot. But the last
five years appear to have been truly exceptional.
Another point is that unit trusts tie themselves to investment in certain
markets. If the market as a whole is down, a fund manager cannot be expected
to deliver a significant gain.
One lesson of this is that investors should always regard picking a unit
trust as a strategic decision as much as anything else. There is no point in
putting money into an excellently managed Japanese smaller companies trust
if the Tokyo market collapses.
Managers are limited to an extent by the performance of the market in which
they invest, and this is measured by indices. A trust which underperforms
the index has some explaining to do, even if its price has significantly
improved.
That, unfortunately, means that the whole industry has some explaining to
do. Over the five years to September 1 this year (an unflattering period to
choose), the FT-A All-Share, including all its yield, managed to increase by
19.65 per cent. In theory, this should do slightly worse than the average UK
unit trust, which is able to reinvest income in a growing fund. But in fact,
the average UK equity general unit trust, according to Micropal, fell by
4.47 per cent over this period. For UK equity growth, the figures are even
worse - a drop of 16.34 per cent over the same period. The UK equity income
sector has registered a drop of 6.87 per cent.
Over 10 years, the average general unit trust increased by 291.91 per cent,
which sounds quite good - until you discover that the total return on the
All-Share rose by 395.5 per cent over the same period. Income funds came
closest to matching the index, with an average growth of 331.22 per cent.
Only nine out of the 48 which have been going this long have actually beaten
the All-Share.
Under-performance is tolerable when the market is doing well - but over the
past few years it has put fund managers in a very unwelcome spotlight. In
essence, the average manager is bound to underperform. The index represents
the average performance of all investors, but it does not allow for costs.
In recent years, many managers have been hit because they held shares in
small companies, which have performed worse than the larger companies which
dominate the indices.
The failure of conventional fund managers to outperform explains the
attractions of 'tracker funds'. These make no attempt to beat the index, but
instead set out, using various complicated quantitative techniques, to match
the index exactly. Generally, this will mean holding on to a large batch of
shares and trading relatively infrequently.
However, as the composition of indices changes periodically, and unit
trusts' open-ended structure dictates that the number of units in
circulation must move from time to time, these funds cannot be totally
inactive, and so index targets will not be exactly matched.
But tracker funds do cut down substantially on the amount of fund managers'
time that needs to be spent in active management. As a result, reduced
charges are possible, although so far in the UK only Gartmore has taken an
initiative in this area, with no initial charge and an annual charge of only
0.5 per cent.
Other UK tracker funds have been launched by Swiss Life, Legal &amp; General,
Royal Life and Morgan Grenfell; and also by James Capel, which has launched
several tracking various world indices, and offers a portfolio management
service switching from index to index.
All have been launched within the past five years, so that fully
satisfactory judgments on their performances are not yet possible, but
things are looking good. After charges are taken into account, the tracking
error is small. Over three years, Gartmore's fund is down 0.96 per cent
(compared with a 3.97 per cent rise in the All-Share), but it is still 4th
out of 85 in its sector. Royal Life's is 20th and Morgan Grenfell's is 21st.
All three are therefore in the top quartile - a powerful argument in favour
of keeping them in a portfolio, at least as a ballast against potential
losses elsewhere.
Talented fund managers who go out of their way to pick individual stocks can
bring home big profits - for example, Capability Special Situations leads
the UK Growth sector over 10 years with growth of 635.22 per cent, and is
still second over one year. But many others fail to beat the index.
And if you think the market will recover, putting some money into a tracker
fund, eliminates the risk of choosing a manager who fails to capitalise on
the opportunity.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEPTEMBER'S LATE boost from devaluation and a UK interest rate cut was
gratefully received by the collective funds sector, but only served to
improve the recent performance of most unit trusts and investment trusts
from dreadful to poor.
But are better times around the corner? A devaluing or floating currency has
been beneficial to equity-based funds at most times during the past 25
years. The few years before and during the entry to the fixed-interest
culture of the Continental members of the European exchange rate mechanism
proved highly difficult. But you can only be seriously optimistic if you
disregard the government's anti-inflationary claims - with an ultimate sub-2
per cent inflation target - and assume a more traditional rate of decline in
the value of money in Britain.
Certainly the five-year performance figures continue to favour fixed income.
Several gilt-edged and preference-share unit trusts are showing rolled-up
values of more than Pounds 1,500 over five years, a performance that only
one UK equity fund and half a dozen North American funds have been able to
match. The gilt and fixed-interest sector average of Pounds 1,358 after five
years, and the similar international fixed interest average of Pounds 1,365,
have beaten all the other sectors out of sight. The closest challenge is
from the Far East ex-Japan sector with Pounds 1,153.
However, the equity sectors are about to strike back. From the end of this
month, the five-year figures will exclude the damage from the October 1987
crash. That should add Pounds 250 or so to the average five-year performance
in the equity sectors when the sums are done for the end of December -
assuming, of course, that there isn't another crash.
But the leap in performance will be, of course, a purely statistical effect,
and will do nothing for the portfolio value of the many investors who piled
into unit trusts in the first nine months of 1987. Few were buyers
immediately after the 1987 crash.
Looking at the shorter-term returns, the UK sectors continue to reflect the
difficulties faced by income funds, which have been plagued both by dividend
cuts and consequential share price declines, so that on average the income
funds have underperformed UK general unit trusts by 5 per cent in the past
year.
Internationally, only the Far East ex-Japan funds have done at all well,
mostly thanks to Hong Kong. However, the American funds have kept their
heads above water and have scored particularly well over two years (starting
from a point of deepest pre-Gulf War gloom).
As for the investment trusts, in general they have lost their performance
edge over unit trusts, but the trusts in the UK income growth and
international general sectors appear to have fared quite well in mostly
unhelpful circumstances.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (23):  Savers put
the tax-break before the return - Personal Equity Plans - Peps have been the
saving of the unit-trust industry - but investor blindness has helped, too /
Survey of Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT TRUST Peps acted as the Seventh Cavalry of the investment scene earlier
this year. But it was the unit trust groups selling Peps who were being
rescued, rather than investors, whose experience since 1987 has sometimes
had the feel of a financial scalping.
With marketing parties likely to muster soon for another onslaught, once the
1987 crash drops out of the five-year performance statistics, recent history
can provide some useful perspective for anyone with cash to allocate.
Packaging them as tax-free Peps has lately been almost the only way to
persuade investors to buy unit trusts. Helped by pre-election scares about
the possible removal of tax breaks, Peps accounted for 84 per cent and 75
per cent of total net unit trust sales during the first and second quarters
of 1992 respectively. Net sales of unit trust Peps hit a record Pounds 336m
in the three months to June - double the figure for the second quarter of
1991.
This was described by Philip Warland, director general of the Unit Trust
Association (UTA), as 'a remarkable achievement in a personal savings market
which saw outflows from building societies and the great attraction of
National Savings.'
He could just as well have saluted the degree of investor blindness induced
by the idea of freedom from tax.
'Tax-free dividends are seen as being of paramount importance in the
decision to take out a Pep,' said Save &amp; Prosper, reporting last year on a
survey which sampled at random 2,000 of its then 55,000 Pep-holders. The
survey, still the most comprehensive available, found that 77 per cent of
Pep investors ranked tax-free dividends as very important. The 'ability to
produce better returns than a building society' got second rating with 66
per cent, followed by freedom from capital gains tax with 62 per cent.
An astonishing 52 per cent of S&amp;P Pep-holders said they had bought the plan
with nothing particular in mind, against 35 per cent who intended the Pep
proceeds for either a lump sum or regular income on retirement.
The unit trust Pep investors were predominantly men (65 per cent) with an
average age of 52, married (74 per cent) and in full-time employment (52 per
cent).
About seven in 10 were standard 25 per cent rate taxpayers, despite the fact
that the tax advantages of Pep are greater for people on the 40 per cent
rate.
However, as it turned out, tax was one of the least of worries for many Pep
investors. Few of them saw a capital gain during the period since Peps were
introduced in 1987; and, because of Peps' tax-free status, losses could not
be offset against any gains elsewhere nor carried forward.
S&amp;P's best-performing unit trust Pep available since January 1987 was
Scotshares, which showed a 52 per cent gain up to mid-September, including
gross income reinvested. But since the original investment limit was Pounds
420, this meant that the actual gain could have been just Pounds 219.
At the other end of the scale, the S&amp;P UK Smaller Companies Growth unit
trust Pep, launched in August 1987, had reduced Pounds 420 to Pounds 320 by
mid-September 1992, a 24 per cent loss. Larger losses have been possible
since the increases in investment limits. For instance, Pounds 3,000
invested in S&amp;P's European Smaller Companies Pep at the beginning of 1990
was worth just Pounds 2,113 by September 14 this year - 30 per cent less. On
the same offer-to-bid basis, allowing for the cost of cashing in the Pep,
Pounds 6,000 invested at the beginning of July 1992 in S&amp;P's UK Growth of
Capital Portfolio Pep was worth about 9 per cent less in mid-September.
Hopes of returns better than building societies could deliver were generally
dashed, as revealed by statistics from Micropal, covering the five years
from September 1, 1987. None of the 91 unit trust Peps covered managed to
equal the Pounds 61 earned risk-free on Pounds 100 in a building society
account. The closest would have been Newton Income, with a return of just
over Pounds 57. But, as Newton's Jonathan Powell explained, the Newton
Income unit trust was not available in Pep form until 1989.
the Newton Income Pep since then, compared with an estimated overall total
for Pep-holders of between 200,000 and 250,000. Figures are vague, as some
members of the UTA count each year's Peps separately, while others
consolidate Peps held by individual investors. Total Peps number somewhere
over a million.
So far the UTA has no precise details of where Pep money is going, though
informal soundings suggest high-income unit trusts as the logical
destination.

postpone capital repayment and save for the long term
</HEADLINE>

REPAYING THE mortgage could be easier than you think.
The classic way is through a 'repayment' mortgage, whereby you repay chunks
of the capital you have borrowed, over a 25-year term, as well as paying
interest.
Repayment mortgages are cosy. But they carry a big opportunity cost. You
have no access to that money once it has been handed over to the lender.
If you opt for an 'interest-only' mortgage, then you only pay the interest
on the loan. Instead of paying capital back to the lender, you can use that
money instead for long-term savings.
If that money is invested sensibly you should be able to make a profit when
the time comes to repay the capital.
After 25 years, you will have to repay all of the capital in one fell swoop.
That can unnerve some people, but inflation, for once, has tended to be the
borrower's ally. In 1967, you could probably have bought a property for
Pounds 5,000 - a sum which, 25 years on, is within some people's monthly
credit-card limit. However, the house price deflation of the last few years
shows that this trick cannot be relied upon to work indefinitely.
This is why interest-only mortgages have a reputation for being risky. They
can be, for the lender - for all they know, you are a spendthrift, who makes
no plans for the future, and goes bankrupt just before the end of 25 years.
But they do not need to be risky for either party, provided a serious
commitment to saving for the capital sum is made at the outset.
This explains the popularity of the endowment mortgage - an interest-only
loan which comes tied to a capital repayment vehicle. Endowments also carry
the undeniable attraction of a 'sum guaranteed'. In other words, they
guarantee to pay you at least a specific fixed sum after 25 years.
Additional bonuses can be added on top of this, and you will usually buy an
endowment on a conservative assumption for future bonuses.
But endowments are inflexible, and effectively force investors to hold on
for 25 years by offering substantially lower rates of return if policies are
surrendered early. There are more tax-efficient alternatives for those with
a little imagination.
Some lenders, such as the Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester building society, will
offer an interest-only loan, based simply on a discussion to establish
whether applicants are responsible borrowers. C&amp;G is adamant that this is a
'no-strings attached' mortgage - the society will not require you to take
out life insurance cover for the value of the capital. Also, there are no
redemption penalties if you happen to be able to repay some capital early.
How much difference does this make? At the beginning of this month C&amp;G were
offering 8.25 per cent fixed for two years for loans, both repayment and
interest-only, of 80 per cent or less of the value of the property.
On a loan of Pounds 60,000, monthly payments would be Pounds 426.87, with a
repayment mortgage, and Pounds 360.94 interest-only. The Pounds 60 saved can
be used for long-term saving.
If Pounds 100,000 is borrowed, monthly payments would be Pounds 745.83 for a
repayment, and Pounds 635.94 interest-only.
The odds are that the nature of the loan will change several times over 25
years. So cheap joint-life first-death convertible renewable term assurance
may be the answer. To cover Pounds 100,000 this will cost you Pounds 15.20
per month for five years, or Pounds 21.90 per month for 10 years, according
to Mark Bolland, of Chamberlain De Broe.
Now the choice is how to do the saving. The two most tax-efficient vehicles
for long-term savings now on offer are personal pension plans (PPPs) and
personal equity plans (Peps). Mortgage 'packages' revolving around both are
available, but neither has yet been particularly popular.
PPPs are very long-term. You cannot get at your money before you retire
without losing tax advantages, but these are massive - your premiums are
grossed up when you pay into the fund, which pays no tax. A PPP also brings
free life cover with it, which may be a benefit.
They are less flexible than an endowment. But their superior tax position is
attractive, as the table provided by the accountants Stoy Hayward makes
clear.
PPP mortgages' problem is that they can tempt you to leave paying off your
debt until you retire. Then, when you do so, you might find a large chunk of
your pension lump sum has to be used to pay off the mortgage. As a rule,
pension planning is an exercise which should be undertaken for its own sake,
and not linked in with the mortgage.
This points towards Peps. They are paid for out of net earnings, but are in
other respects as tax-efficient as pensions. You have complete freedom over
when you access the cash in the Pep, and over how you spend it.
In all these respects they are superior to endowments. However, even over a
long term, investors might be bothered by the total exposure to equities
which Peps entail, so they should be topped up with tax-efficient cash
products, such as Tessa accounts and National Savings.
The big danger with Pep savings is that savers give up when returns are
looking bad. But here the flexibility of Peps again scores. The discipline
of an endowment comes from penal surrender values, which are no good to the
consumer. You can put money into five different Peps over 25 years, and
spread risk - the same exercise with endowments would be ruinously
expensive.
So an interest-only mortgage has great attractions for anyone prepared to
take their financial destiny in their own hands. As Mr Bolland puts it: 'The
lenders are treating the borrowers as sensible adults.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (25): A more
flexible route than an AVC - Retirement Planning, You can use the money as
and when you wish, with no obligation to buy extra pension / Survey of Unit
Trusts
</HEADLINE>

FEW EMPLOYEES qualify for the maximum permissible pension and benefits from
their company pension scheme, and so may need to boost their income in
retirement.
The most tax-efficient method is by paying additional voluntary
contributions (AVCs). But an AVC scheme is inflexible, because the benefits
must be taken when employees take their pension from the main scheme.
Moreover, under all AVC arrangements made since April 1987, the accumulated
value of the contract cannot be taken as a cash sum, but must be used to buy
a pension.
Personal equity plans (Peps) offer employees either an alternative savings
vehicle to AVCs or a way to supplement an AVC.
Although investment into a Pep does not qualify for tax relief, unlike
investment into an AVC scheme, in all other respects a Pep matches an AVC in
tax efficiency, with investment in a gross fund and the proceeds being free
of tax.
In addition, a Pep has a flexibility not available to an AVC. Employees can
cash it at any time: they do not have to cash in simply because they are
have started to receive their company pension. Nor are they locked in if
they want to cash the Pep before they start to take a company pension.
This can be important if you have invested in an equity-based fund. With an
AVC contract, you must cash in when taking the pension, irrespective of the
state of the market. So if the market is depressed at retirement, you
suffer. With a Pep, you can wait for a time when the market is more buoyant.
More important so far as most employees are concerned: the accumulated value
is taken as a tax-free cash sum, to do what they like with it.
A further advantage of a Pep is that the investor can receive dividends
tax-free, boosting income while leaving the capital in the Pep.
Alternatively, a bigger boost to income can be achieved by purchasing an
annuity with the cash from the Pep.
Employees who are within a few years of retirement will need to make large
contributions to an AVC contract in order to produce a significant increase
in pension. For example, a cash sum of Pounds 5,000 would buy a pension of
only Pounds 36.88 a month for a man aged 65, and only Pounds 27.86 a month
for a woman aged 60, with the pension increasing by 5 per cent a year. If
allowance is made for a spouse's pension on the death of the employee, the
pension would be even lower.
In such circumstances, the employee could well decide that a cash sum is
preferable to the pension that the sum would buy, and that a Pep is better
than an AVC contract. In which case, certainly for the financially
unsophisticated, a unit trust Pep is usually preferable to one investing
direct in equities.
A great number of unit trust Peps are available, covering most sectors of
the UK equity market, and employees may at first be confused. There are,
however, certain general considerations that should be taken into account:
1, The employee is likely to be more concerned with capital growth than with
income; so he would be looking at growth-orientated unit trust Peps.
2, The Pep represents savings on top of the pension secured by his main
company scheme. Consequently he can afford to take risks for the opportunity
of greater growth. This means that the more volatile sectors, such as
recovery funds and smaller companies funds, may be worth consideration.
3, The UK equity market is currently unsettled, and this may deter employees
from investing in unit trusts. However, they need to keep in mind that,
historically, equities have always outperformed fixed-interest investments
and cash over all but very short periods.
4, Employees should check the charges that are made on unit trust Peps.
Finally, in selecting a unit trust Pep, they should check both the
investment record of the trusts they are interested in, and the reputation
of the investment managers.
At retirement, most employees exercise the option to forego ('commute') part
of their company pension in exchange for a tax-free cash sum. (Employees
retiring from public sector schemes automatically receive a tax-free sum).
Many want to boost their income in retirement, but also to preserve their
capital.
Until this year, a high-income unit trust, investing in selected UK
equities, had provided investors with a steadily rising income over the long
term, while the unit value had also risen to match the loss of value through
inflation.
This year has seen many unit trust managers having to cut income
distributions as companies have reduced their dividends. So the current
depressed condition of the UK equity market may not seem conducive to
investment in unit trusts. However, past records show that equity values
have recovered steadily from periods of reduced values; while companies
generally try to restore dividend cuts as soon as practicable.
At retirement, employees should also consider the so-called Fourth Age -
usually regarded as the time when they will reach 75 and could well begin to
require special care. So retirement is not necessarily the time when savings
end and they can go on a spending spree. They need to think of the future
and the possible special expenses during the final years of their lives.
The cash sum that becomes available at retirement could be set aside for
this purpose, but the underlying investment must provide a return that
matches inflation. Unit trusts still provide that hedge - though, because of
their volatility, they should be regarded as long-term investments. But a
retiring employee, investing for that Fourth Age, has at least 10 years in
which to save.
If immediate income is not a requirement, then the investment could be made
in growth-orientated trusts, with the option of switching to an income trust
at a later.

Fortunately, the crash will soon cease clouding the five-year numbers /
Survey of Unit Trusts

<TEXT>
THIS YEAR has seen both crisis and opportunity for the unit trust industry.
During the gloomy summer stock markets, investors deserted the sector, with
net repurchases running at Pounds 141.7m in July. Prospects for equity
returns seemed unappealing, and the trusts could hardly champion their past
performance figures - many had recorded a loss over the five years since the
peak of the bull market in 1987.
Nevertheless, unit trust managers were handed one marketing advantage. The
budget allowed unit trust personal equity plans (Peps) to qualify for the
full Pounds 6,000 annual limit. Previously, the sector had been losing a lot
of Pep business to investment trust new issues.
And even in bear markets, the sector's inherent flexibility means that it is
able to switch its marketing effort to bond funds and cash trusts  - an
option not available to investment trusts.
But the unit trust industry still needs to take action in two areas: charges
and performance. Over the past few years, while the latter has been
dreadful, the former have increased, creating a double squeeze on investors.
Charging has represented a thorny problem for trusts. The bulk of the
initial charge has traditionally been needed to pay financial intermediaries
a 3 per cent commission to sell the product. So abolishing the charge would
mean finding a way of selling the trusts directly to the public.
But selling directly requires a substantial advertising campaign - and
without an initial charge, the fund managers would have no cash flow to fund
such a marketing drive.
There are ways of making money in fund management without an initial charge
 -as US managers have shown. The trick is to build up a sufficiently large
fund, so that the managers can earn their profit from the annual fee alone.
But the US market is much bigger than the UK, and has a greater tradition of
direct selling to the public - so the feat is a lot easier to achieve on the
other side of the Atlantic.
This year, British fund managers have shown signs of trying to address this
problem. A succession of management groups has cut the initial charge, in an
attempt to stimulate investor interest in their funds.
They have 'reclaimed' the charge in different ways, but normally via a
higher annual charge or an 'exit' fee. The former has the benefit of
simplicity, and allows the manager to use the extra portion to pay
intermediaries. The exit-fee route is designed to encourage long-term
investment, by gradually reducing the charge over time.
Part of the impetus for this change has been provided by Peps. In order to
take maximum advantage of the tax break, intermediaries have been urging
investors to write out a cheque for more than the Pounds 6,000 limit - with
the excess representing the initial charge. The effect has been to draw
charges to the attention of the investors, and thereby create consumer
pressure for change.
This factor may dent the industry's enthusiasm for single pricing. The idea
sounds good; the whole paraphernalia of bid, offer and cancellation prices
could be swept away in favour of one price, which investors would get
whether they were buying or selling. Unit trusts would become far easier for
the average investor to understand.
But the corollary to such a change is that charges would have to be shown
separately. Instead of investing Pounds 5,000 at the offer price (and thus
effectively paying Pounds 300 in charges via the bid-offer spread),
unitholders would invest Pounds 4,700 and pay Pounds 300 in charges on top.
The difference would be cosmetic, but it might open the eyes of investors to
what they had previously been paying.
Eventually, the UK market might develop into something like its US
counterpart, with no-load, low-load and high-load funds (all named with
reference to the size of their initial charge) all competing for investors'
money.
However, although the issue of charging is important, it should not be
allowed to obscure the issue of performance. What the sector really needs is
a bull market in equities. Only when unit trust growth figures start to
outstrip building society returns can the industry recover some of its lost
popularity.
The performance factor is about to improve. From November, the crash of 1987
will disappear from the five-year figures. Since the crash pushed the UK
markets down by around 35 per cent in a month, there should be a substantial
revision in the unit trust performance tables, with many funds moving from
negative to positive territory.
Nevertheless, the past few years have made private investors view any
equity-linked product as a quick way to lose their capital. The answer could
be guaranteed funds, where the investor is ensured that, whatever happens,
his original capital will remain intact.
It is possible to offer such products by using the options and futures
markets. In so-called 90-10 funds, 90 per cent of the money is invested on
deposit and grows to repay the original capital; the other 10 per cent is
used to play options and futures in order to get the exposure to equities.
To date, however, it has been impossible to offer this facility within an
onshore, open-ended fund structure.
Even if managers get round these difficulties, sophisticated investors will
always realise that a guarantee comes at a price - normally the lack of any
income return.
Experienced equity investors will probably be increasingly attracted by
tracker funds - trusts which aim to match the index. Although professional
fund managers claim that they can beat the index, few are able to do so. A
tracker fund will nearly always have above-average performance in a rising
market - and thus bring a measure of certainty to investors bewildered by
the 1,400 or so trusts currently on offer.
In the ideal world, a British investor would be able to choose from a range
of tracker funds with no initial charge - and place them in a Pep just in
time to enjoy an old-fashioned bull market. Unitholders, dream on.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Bush urges Americans to shun Perot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday urged Americans not to 'waste' their votes
by supporting Mr Ross Perot, the independent candidate, in the presidential
election. 'I don't think he can possibly win,' he declared, 'and I think he
knows that.'
Mr Perot promptly countered with an advanced screening of his latest
television commercial, in which he says: 'You are throwing your vote away
unless you vote your conscience' and 'don't waste your vote on traditional
politicians.'
Campaigning in the west, Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate, said he
thought a resurgent Perot could draw more votes from him than from Mr Bush,
but he declined to criticise Mr Perot directly.
Turning his fire on his fellow Texan at last, Mr Bush told a TV interviewer
that Mr Perot 'has some nutty ideas and makes some crazy statements about me
giving Saddam Hussein permission to take the northern part of Kuwait.' The
world, he said, was a bit more complicated than Mr Perot's simplistic
approach implied.
The president, who has been hammering Governor Bill Clinton with joyous
abandon all week, predicted he would win on November 3.
The latest poll evidence is mixed. Some report a contraction in Mr Clinton's
lead; others do not. All detect an increase in support for Mr Perot, but by
varying amounts.
A new NBC poll released last night gave Mr Clinton 47 per cent, Mr Bush 28
per cent and Mr Perot 19 per cent - three times as much as he was getting
two weeks ago. This was similar to an ABC poll of registered voters who
watched the trio's TV debate on Monday night, where the split was 48:29:19,
compared with 52:29:11 before the debate.
Three other 'tracking' polls, which measure sentiment daily, give Mr Clinton
a smaller lead and Mr Perot a smaller surge. The USA Today/CNN split was
45:32:15, a separate ABC survey had 44:32:16 and Battleground 46:32:17.
Mr Bush's attrack on Mr Perot yesterday not only returns the latter's TV
assault on him on Monday, but also follows the assertion by aides to the
independent candidate that Mr Bush himself is 'no longer a factor' in the
election.
'We think Bush is down so far he can never recover,' Mr Clay Mulford said.
'If you take 30 per cent of Clinton's vote and put it with ours we can win,'
he went on to claim.
Mr Orson Swindle, the campaign director reprimanded by Mr Perot for his
criticisms of Mr Clinton, repeated them and said only Mr Perot represented a
vote for change. This is being pressed in the massive new television
advertising blitz which is due to start tonight.
The Clinton campaign's concern is that the anti-Bush vote might be split too
much for comfort, particularly in the mountain states where Mr Perot has
long been popular but where the Democrats hold real hopes of breaking the
Republican monopoly.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Internal Revenue Service is challenging several hundred million
dollars of tax credits claimed by US banks on loans to Brazil.
In a test case brought to the US Tax Court by Riggs National Bank, a small
Washington DC bank, the IRS says US banks claimed 'phantom' credits for
withholding taxes paid in Brazil in the mid-1980s.
Although the Riggs case involves relatively small sums, the IRS said in
court filings that Citibank, the big New York-based banking group,
'presumably has the largest stake in the outcome'.
Citibank officials declined to comment on the case, but the bank is involved
in a suit with the IRS on the same subject.
The IRS says Riggs produced receipts for taxes paid on loans it made to the
Brazilian central bank, but contends that the central bank in fact never
paid any such tax to the Brazilian treasury.
'The fundamental purpose of the foreign tax credit is to avoid double
taxation, and there simply was not taxation in Brazil,' the IRS said in
documents filed with the tax court.
The IRS has been broadly successful in similar cases it brought earlier
against banks involved in lending to other Latin American countries such as
Mexico, but some of the legal issues remain in dispute.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Franco seeks far-reaching fiscal reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Itamar Franco, Brazil's acting-president, has abandoned plans to impose
new emergency taxes in favour of a sweeping fiscal adjustment to be
introduced by the end of the year, in order to cover an expected Dollars
20bn shortfall in the budget next year.
He rejected proposals from his economic team on Wednesday night to introduce
two stop-gap taxes - one on cheques and another on items such as fuel and
telecommunications - that would have left restructuring for next year.
Instead, he said he wanted to take advantage of his current political
support in Congress to push through structural changes requiring
constitutional amendments in an 'all or nothing' strategy.
'Let us be daring]' he was quoted by ministers as saying, as he outlined
ambitious plans to redress completely the balance between the federal
government and states and municipalities.
Under the constitution, most revenues are divided among local governments,
while most responsibilities remain in the hands of the cash-starved centre.
Mr Franco is well placed to tackle this controversial issue. Brought to
power three weeks ago by a popular movement and a Congressional vote to
initiate impeachment of President Fernando Collor, he has the most support
in Congress of any president in recent Brazilian history and intends to
exploit that.
Unlike Mr Collor, Mr Franco is working closely with politicians, involving
congressmen, state governors and mayors.
Fiscal reform has long been viewed as vital for the struggle against
inflation, but has always been put off because of the difficulty of
obtaining Congressional approval. A 25 per cent real fall in tax revenue
over the last two years and the rise in inflation to 27 per cent a month
have injected new urgency.
The Brazilian Senate has approved the issue of Dollars 7.2bn in bonds for
unpaid interest on the country's foreign debt, accumulated during a debt
moratorium in 1989-90.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Skulduggery on the low road to Congress: George Graham finds
candidates slinging mud as they seek seats in the Senate and House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush has spent much time on his campaign trips lamenting
that this is the dirtiest political year he can remember.
Some commentators have agreed but the presidential race has seemed genteel
in comparison with some of the mud-wrestling contests in Congressional
elections across the US.
Incumbent members have faced uphill struggles against opponents who have
gleefully leapt on, and often distorted, the number of cheques they may have
overdrawn at the now defunct House of Representatives private bank.
Some, however, have been accused of much, much more; Congressman Steny Hoyer
of Maryland, chairman of the House Democratic caucus, for example, is the
target of radio advertisements which stop a whisker short of charging him
with condoning cocaine sales by employees of the House post office, under
his authority.
Mr Hoyer, however, can take comfort from the fact that it is his
institutional role which is under attack.
Others have seen their personal lives come under close and critical
scrutiny. An election in a Georgia district just north of Atlanta is widely
seen as the most vituperative battle so far. It is between Congressman Newt
Gingrich, the minority whip in the House and number one on the Democratic
hit list of Republicans they would like to see defeated, and Mr Tony Center,
a trial lawyer. The latter ran radio advertisements calling Mr Gingrich a
'deadbeat dad' for failing to make child support payments to his ex-wife.
'The same Newt Gingrich who used taxpayer money for his limo had to be
ordered by the court to pay for his kids' heat and electricity. No more
perks, no more lies, no more Newt,' the Center ad said.
It also accused Mr Gingrich of serving divorce papers on his wife the day
after her cancer operation. A Gingrich spokesman said divorce papers were
never served.
Mr Gingrich countered with a television advertisement accusing Mr Center of
working to withhold child support payments from two children whose mother
had not paid him the legal fees she owed.
'Center actually sued to strip a four-year-old and a one-year-old of their
child support to pay his own legal fee. He even claimed his own fee mattered
more than the children's food, medicine and shelter,' the ad said.
The level of abuse in the race is viewed by campaign managers as an
indication of how close it is likely to be. The district ought to be
Republican, but Mr Gingrich is a newcomer to the area, and won his party's
nomination by only 980 votes after a heated primary.
In the Colorado Senate race, dirty tricks have also run wild. Mr Ben
Nighthorse Campbell, the pony-tailed Olympic judoka and jewellery designer
who is now the only Native American in Congress, had to fire two aides who
called in under false names to a radio show featuring his opponent, Mr Terry
Considine, and tried to lure him into expressing an extreme view on
abortion.
Sometimes, however, the mud flies back in the thrower's face. Mr Rick Reed,
the Republican with the near -impossible task of challenging Hawaii's
popular Senator Daniel Inouye, resorted to advertisements claiming that he

Mr Reed has been forced to withdraw the ad, and has been rebuked by Hawaii's

votes,' Mr Jossem said.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Compass revises Gardner bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPASS Group, which last July failed in its bid to buy Gardner
Merchant, Forte's contract catering company, is preparing an offer for the
non-UK parts of the business.
The contract caterer and private hospital operator has not yet approached
Forte to discuss buying Gardner Merchant's foreign operations, but it is
thought it will do so next week.
After the collapse of negotiations last summer, Forte ruled out Compass as a
possible future buyer of Gardner Merchant. It is likely, however, that Forte
will examine any approach to buy Gardner Merchant's foreign business with an
open mind.
Forte is believed to be negotiating to sell the business to the Gardner
Merchant management, although it has rejected reports that it will sell it
for less than the Pounds 400m it has laid down as the minimum price. A
management buy-out would be backed by CinVen, the UK's second largest
venture capital investor.
Forte said yesterday that Gardner Merchant would not be sold unless three
conditions were satisfied. The first is that the minimum price would have to
be achieved. The second is that Gardner Merchant would not be broken up and
the third that the Gardner Merchant senior management team would remain in
place.
If the subsidiary's management could raise the Pounds 400m, it would have
little difficulty in satisfying the remaining two conditions.
A bid from Compass to buy Gardner Merchant's foreign business could make it
easier for the management to buy the UK operation.
Gardner Merchant is particularly strong in the Netherlands, where it is the
market leader. It also has operations in France and Germany, which are
believed to be of particular Interest to Compass.
Compass is thought to be less interested in Gardner Merchant's US operation.
It is possible, however, that this could be sold to ARA Services, the US
company which joined Compass in its original bid for Gardner Merchant.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Morgan Crucible to establish ADR programme
in early 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN CRUCIBLE, the carbon, ceramics and speciality materials company, is
to establish an American Depositary Receipt programme early next year.
The issue is likely to be made through the Bank of New York and will allow
certain institutional investors and employees to hold the securities.
Mr Bruce Farmer, chief executive, said the group is unlikely to extend the
programme beyond the first phase at this stage and would therefore not be
forced to move to full quarterly reporting.
The ADR programme will put managers of Morgan Crucible's 30 US operations in
closer contact with the group, which at the last half-year derived 38 per
cent of sales from North America. Only 16 per cent of group sales were in
the UK.
The North American operation is producing a varied performance. Growth is
beginning to accelerate in parts of the thermal ceramics division through
sales of new products, such as filters for safety air bags in cars.
Mr Farmer believes such new products should soon begin to kick start what
has become a mature business with falling operating profits.
Sales from carbon activities are supported from the substantial increase in
the number of electric motors required in new cars - each requiring
commutators and brushes. However, the group's National Electric Carbon
subsidiary has been hit by recession and has been less successful moving
into new markets.
In technical ceramics, growth from new areas, such as biomedical products,
was almost offset by a decline in traditional areas, including provision of
materials for white goods.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hoskins rebels join battle with directors
next week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL SHAREHOLDERS in Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale brewer,
will join battle with the directors at the company's annual meeting on
October 30.
Mr Richard Cattermole, leader of the dissident group, said yesterday that a
number of board resolutions would be opposed. He claimed to have the support
of shareholders with at least 30 per cent of the votes.
Hoskins reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 83,060 last year, but
extraordinary charges reduced the net gain to Pounds 16,625. In the previous
12 months, there was a loss of Pounds 167,553 after an extraordinary charge
of Pounds 238,267.
Mr Cattermole's main targets are Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, and his brother,
Mr Robert Hoar. Resolutions to remove them from the board have been tabled
for an extraordinary meeting on November 18.
Mr Cattermole said yesterday that he had no intention of trying to reverse
his company, Ryan Elizabeth - which has 52 licensed outlets and five hotels
 -into Hoskins.
Replying to criticisms that he had no experience as a director of a quoted
company, he said: 'Ryan Elizabeth made net profits of Pounds 294,000 last
year, and Pounds 308,000 the previous year. We have to abide by rules that
are not all that different from those for running a public company.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker sells phoneline arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT WALKER has sold Interactive Media Services, its telephone information
business, to a management buy-out for Pounds 12.7m.
IMS operates the Rapid Raceline, Rapid Cricketline and Rapid Golfline
services which give callers to an 0891 telephone number up-to-date
information on those sports.
Brent Walker, the betting, pubs and property group trying to reduce its
heavy debts through asset sales, has received Pounds 10.7m cash and is
lending the buy-out the other Pounds 2m, at a 5 per cent interest rate. This
will rank below the mbo's Pounds 4m of senior debt, and will be repaid after
the senior debt has been repaid, probably by October 1996.
Mr John Brown, a director of Brent Walker and head of its William Hill
betting chain, and his deputy Mr Robert Lambert, will receive up to Pounds
1.7m of the proceeds of the sale. They had an equity interest in the
telephone business dating back to an agreement they made with Mr George
Walker, former chairman and chief executive of Brent Walker, in September
1989 when the company bought William Hill.
The other Pounds 11m of the sale proceeds will be retained by Brent Walker.
The buy-out is led by Mr Bill Wilson, managing director of the company. It
has Pounds 7m of equity backing from 3i, Murray Johnstone and County NatWest
Ventures.
The purchase price compares with net assets of Pounds 1.5m at December 31
1991, and net profits last year of Pounds 2.45m.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Sketchley flat at Pounds 3m but reinstates
interim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKETCHLEY, the textile rental and dry cleaning group which was on the brink
of collapse two years ago, reported virtually flat profits of Pounds 3.1m
for the 27 weeks to October 2.
The pre-tax result, which compared with Pounds 3.18m for the 26 weeks to
September 27 1991, was helped by a 59 per cent fall in interest charges to
Pounds 625,000 (Pounds 1.51m). Sales were Pounds 1m lower at Pounds 53.7m.
An interim dividend of 1p is declared. Last year's interim was passed.
Earnings per share rose from 4.1p to 4.2p.
The government's climbdown on the immediate closure of 31 pits was welcome
news at Sketchley, which supplies workwear for British Coal's 44,705 miners.
However, the group said the 10 pits earmarked for closure would have little
effect on full-year profits.
Sketchley had been budgeting for a steady decline in the number of miners
since 1990, when there were about 90,000. This year, the group had counted
on less than 45,000 miners and a further decline next year. If the
government's initial plans had been carried out, there would have been about
14,000 miners after the closures.
Mr Tony Bloom, joint deputy chairman of the management team brought in two
years ago to rescue the ailing group, said Sketchley was ready to hit the
acquisition trail. However, it had been more difficult than expected to find
suitable purchases.
During the six months, Sketchley continued to bolster the balance sheet,
with gearing falling from 31 to 22 per cent. The group aimed to reduce this
to between 15 and 18 per cent by the year-end.
Trading had been difficult in the six months, with the dry-cleaning business
suffering declines in both sales and profits.
Mr Bloom said the difference between a good and a bad year came to just
three customers per shop per day. There was little other than economic
upturn which could entice those customers in, he said.
Textile rentals actually increased profits, and Mr Bloom said the outlook
continued to be good. Several larger contracts had been won, including
supplying J Sainsbury and Unigate.
COMMENT
The writing may have been on the wall for British mining, but at least
Sketchley read it in time. The new contracts go a long way to meeting the
loss of coal business. Analysts guess that Sainsbury's alone could represent
Pounds 13m in sales over three years. Then there is Unigate, with an
estimated 10,000 workers ready to don the Sketchley gear. But the best news
yesterday might well have been the dividend. Although the company resumed
pay-outs at the end of last year, the interim declaration offers good hope
for a maintained final at the very least. The one big cloud hanging over
this vastly changed company is the highly uncertain litigation with
Eurocopy, which could run to claims of more than Pounds 9m. That shadow is
not likely to disappear for at least three years. However, as a recovery
play, Sketchley could have some attractions. Forecasts of about Pounds 5.5m
this year leave the group on a prospective p/e of about 13 times.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Disposal benefits behind 13% advance to
Pounds 4.7m at Ferguson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPOSAL of its loss-making businesses enabled Ferguson International
Holdings, the labels, hangers, communications components and printing and
publishing company, to report a 13 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 4.7m in the six months to August 31.
Mr Michael Saint, managing director, said: 'We took the medicine last year.'
In the 12 months to February 29 1992 pre-tax profits tumbled 43 per cent to
Pounds 6.63m.
Turnover of continuing activities - at Pounds 61.8m - grew by Pounds 4.7m,
almost the same as the contribution from discontinued activities last time.
The company sold SBF of Philadelphia and Wirewares and Harkwell Cartons of
the UK. It also closed Harkwell Labels &amp; Tags.
Trading profits on continuing businesses rose to Pounds 5.15m (Pounds 4.95m)
 -discontinued activities incurred losses of Pounds 233,000 last time. The
pre-tax line was further helped by a Pounds 100,000 reduction in interest
payable to Pounds 450,000, as borrowings were reduced from about Pounds 10m
to Pounds 6.64m.
Mr Saint said that 67 per cent of trading profits derived from the UK, 21
per cent from the US and 12 per cent from Europe, though the group was
seeking to lessen its dependence on the UK, he added.
The labels division, which makes textile labels for garments and non-textile
labels for food products, lifted trading profits to Pounds 2.73m (Pounds
2.23m) on turnover up at Pounds 28m (Pounds 23.3m), helped by the
acquisition of Globus Druck of Germany.
Hangers suffered from a fall-off in demand in Germany and the Netherlands,
where the division has a 60 per cent market share. This led to a 3 per cent
reduction in turnover to Pounds 15.6m. Trading profits fell to Pounds 1.33m
(Pounds 1.49m).
Profits of the communications components side, the US cable TV parts
supplier described by Mr Saint as a cash generator to buy tooling and
machines for the other divisions, declined to Pounds 718,000 (Pounds
920,000) hit by competitive pressure on margins and unfavourable exchange
rates. Turnover rose at Pounds 8.93m (Pounds 8.27m) mostly because of the
acquisition of Interstate Cable Enterprises.
Printing and publishing lifted profits to Pounds 372,000 (Pounds 312,000) on
lower turnover of Pounds 9.32m (Pounds 9.5m).
Earnings rose 1p to 9.3p per share and the interim dividend is unchanged at
4.25p.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Linx Printing shares at 14p premium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares of Linx Printing Technologies, a maker of continuous ink jet printing
equipment, ended their first day of trading at 144p, a 14p premium to the
price at which they were placed last week.
The company joins quoted Domino Printing Sciences and a small handful of
British companies that have successfully developed commercial applications
for high technology breakthroughs.
One of the two venture capital backers, MTI Managers, which represents 18
institutions with 37 per cent of the equity, has not disposed of any of its
stake during the flotation which values Linx at Pounds 20.8m. The other
backer, Paribas, has sold some of its holding.
During the ink jet process tiny droplets are given an electrical charge and
then deflected electronically as they are squirted from the printer head.
More than 120,000 droplets are projected each second.
The printers are placed at the end of production lines to print bar codes or
sell by dates on boxes, bottles and other produce with minimum operator
intervention. The process has been used to print on fibre optic cable.
Mr Derek Harris, chairman, said the group would use its stock market quote
and the technological expertise within the group to expand. 'We would like
to develop more in the product identification market,' he said.
Linx is the first successful flotation for MTI Managers. The group, which
specialises in technology start-ups, has invested Pounds 800,000 since Linx
was launched in 1987.
Of the Pounds 4.7m proceeds of the flotation, Linx has raised Pounds 1.3m
after expenses while shareholders have taken out Pounds 1.5m.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Crops glut reduces Albert Fisher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALBERT FISHER, the food processing and distribution group, which yesterday
reported a sharp drop in profitability in the year to August 31, said
substantial rationalisation had taken place across the group.
Mr Tim Howden, chief executive in Europe, said: 'Three-quarters of our
profit shortfall in Europe was in fresh produce, where our management faced
the most difficult market conditions in recent memory.'
Operating profit in the European fresh produce activities fell from Pounds
15.2m to Pounds 7.5m. Profits advanced in the first half but deteriorated
markedly in the second six months.
Underlying growth in production coincided with lower than expected growth in
demand. The situation was aggravated by early and abundant crops throughout
Europe and intense competition for banana sales.
Food processing in Europe saw operating profits dip to Pounds 28.4m (Pounds
32m), but the group said results had held up well in adverse market
conditions. The division had been enlarged by the transfer in of the frozen
fruit and vegetable activities.
The production of sauces and dressings had been concentrated into two
factories from three. The frozen vegetable business experienced a difficult
year, affected by plentiful supplies and strong competition, while the
remaining businesses in the division produced results close to or above the
previous year's outcome.
The European seafood side achieved operating profits of Pounds 7.67m (Pounds
6.71m). The group said the five seafood companies had now been formed into a
separate division for management purposes, which should produce sourcing
benefits. The division's profits were held back by cockle supply problems, a
poor market for warm water prawns and low demand.
The North American fresh produce businesses saw operating profits drop from
Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 10.8m. Results at the half-year had been under
pressure due to the continuing impact of recession on the food service
industry, supplying hotels and cruise lines, which is responsible for the
majority of sales.
In the second half favourable growing conditions in the US resulted in a
produce glut similar to that in Europe, causing further pressure on prices
and margins.
The group said: 'Economic conditions in the UK and North America remain
severely depressed and weaker economic conditions are now being experienced
in continental Europe.
'While an early improvement in economic conditions is not foreseen, it is
unlikely that the combination of conditions which gave rise to the current
produce glut will continue to the same extent in the coming season, although
the present surplus of produce will overhang the market for some time to
come.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (21):  A way to iron
out the market's bumps - Savings Schemes, It's known in the jargon as
'pound/cost averaging' - you buy more units when they are cheap and fewer
when they are dear / Survey of Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVINGS SCHEMES are a gentle way into unit trusts, likely to appeal to those
who want to dip their toes into equities or are unable to invest a large
lump sum.
The ability to build up savings cheaply and simply is one advantage; another
is that, by making payments on a regular basis, the investor is protecting
himself from stock market volatility.
A monthly contribution of Pounds 20 a month (the minimum for all schemes,
apart from Pounds 10 at Prosperity), might buy, for example, 20 units at
100p. However, if the unit price falls to 50p, you will buy 40 units.
Conversely, you would get only 10 units if the unit price rose to 200p.
In other words, you buy more units when they are cheap and fewer when they
are dear. This is known in the jargon as 'pound/cost averaging'. Of course,
if the market falls relentlessly, this is little consolation: you are still
losing money. But there is no point in investing if you think that prices
are going to fall for ever.
The unit trust industry has come to appreciate small savers since net new
sales fell in the wake of the 1987 crash - from Pounds 6.3bn that year to
Pounds 1.8bn in 1988. Regular savers proved more reliable than other
investors, and the guarantee of money coming in through the savings schemes
was a mitigating factor in performance after the crash, says Mintel, the
market research organisation.
The industry has since become far more interested in marketing through the
vehicle of personal equity plans (Peps - see page 21). Figures from the Unit
Trust Association show that virtually the only way to sell a unit trust
these days is on the back of a Pep.
The annual limit of Pounds 6,000 in a unit or investment trust Pep is the
equivalent of Pounds 500 a month in a savings scheme. If, therefore, you are
thinking of investing large sums regularly, you might consider doing so
through a savings scheme into a Pep, in order to benefit from capital gains
and income tax exemption. However, most companies stipulate a much higher
minimum for payments into a Pep than the Pounds 20 to Pounds 50 for ordinary
savings schemes.
Remember that, when times are good, you may be able to afford a higher
contribution to a regular savings scheme, but that if you do have to cut
back on personal expenditure, it becomes important to have the flexibility
of a savings scheme with an affordable minimum.
Most funds also expect you to build up a minimum amount through your
savings, usually Pounds 500 or Pounds 1,000; and if you are unable to do
this, you may be obliged to sell your units. It is therefore worth bearing
this in mind before committing yourself.
Meanwhile, as the tables show, the best performance of schemes over 15 years
has been more than double the best over 10 years - an indication of the
greater gains to be had over a longer period, combined with the compounding
effect of reinvesting income.
N&amp;P has the singular achievement of showing the best results over both
periods, but only two other funds - James Capel Income and M&amp;G Midland &amp;
General - feature in both tables. Moreover, it is noticeable that the best
performers over 15 years have been in the UK market, particularly the UK
Equity Income sector. The picture is more mixed over the 10-year span,
because the unit trust industry vastly expanded its range in the 1980s.
But the tables underline the difficulty investors face in spotting a
potential high performer. Even if you had picked the best sector for the
15-year period, UK Equity Income, there was no guarantee that you would also
have hit upon the top-performing fund.
Over 10 years, Pounds 50 invested in N&amp;P's UK Equity Income fund would have
turned a total investment of Pounds 6,000 into Pounds 15,735, a return of
over 150 per cent. However, few investors are likely to have picked the
winner, and the average unit trust's performance has been much weaker.
This is particularly true of the shorter-term performance of unit trusts,
hard hit by the crash. If you had invested in the average unit trust over
the five years ending August 1 this year, you would have incurred a loss,
turning Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 914, according to Money Management, the
monthly magazine for professional advisers.
So investing through a savings scheme is still not a guarantee of profit, or
of quick returns. But it does represent an alternative to the more
frequently marketed long-term savings instrument, the endowment policy.
Since a unit trust savings scheme is a pure investment contract - unlike an
endowment, which is a mixture of savings and life cover - the long-term
returns are likely to be higher. In terms of tax efficiency, a unit trust
Pep is superior. And the flexibility of a unit trust Pep - there are no
penalties for early surrender - offers a clear advantage over an endowment.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (30): Ageing
pop-pickers still believe in yesterday - Alternative Investments / The
Beatles dominate a memorabilia market that twice a year draws the fans to
London's salerooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<TEXT>
IF, TUCKED away in your loft, you have that photograph of John Lennon that
he autographed in 1962, or a poster for a concert at Liverpool's Cavern Club
around 1960, or a fan letter signed by one (or ideally all) of the Fab Four,
you own a modern antique, with a value, a small value, at auction.
Sales of pop memorabilia are one of the few sectors of the art market that
have so far bucked the recession. When Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips
held their annual summer sales in London in August (bunched in the same week
to lure over the big buyers in the US and Japan), they sold around 85 per
cent by value of the thousand-plus lots on offer. Prices, and demand, are
lower now for the more commonplace items, but star lots attract star prices.
This market is dominated by the Beatles. About 40 per cent of the lots on
offer this summer related to the band, and certain major buyers, like the
Japanese, are interested in no one else. There is a thriving replica of the
Cavern Club in Tokyo, to say nothing of an enthusiastic fan club; and many
rich Japanese have their own personal shrines to the Beatles.
Other pop idols are collected, notably the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson,
Prince, Buddy Holly, Jimi Hendrix and Madonna; and, by dying, Freddie
Mercury has improved his retail value no end. But the Beatles remain
supreme. Elvis Presley material is rare in the UK, and the market for him is
concentrated in the US.
But the UK started pop memorabilia auctions, in 1981, and twice a year its
major sales attract the big players, in particular the various Hard Rock
Cafes, which, in their quest to decorate their dining-rooms with physical
reminders of the stars, tend to underpin the market. There is also a good
attendance by fans who, in the prosperity of middle age, can afford to buy a
memory of their youth.
Ask Hilary Kaye, of Sotheby's, who pioneered the concept and whose saleroom
still dominates (keenly chased by Christie's South Kensington), what items
she is most excited to accept from a mass of, usually rejected, material and
she answers: manuscripts of Beatles songs in the original hand of Lennon or
McCarthy.
In August, she had a wonderful selection, which neatly pinpointed the
commercial pulling power of the four - Lennon out in front, followed by
McCartney, with Harrison and Starr some way behind. John Lennon's lyrics for
A Day in the Life more than doubled their estimate in setting the top price
of the sale at Pounds 48,400, while McCartney's She's Leaving Home trebled
the forecast at Pounds 45,100. In comparison, the lyrics of While My Guitar
Gently Weeps, by George Harrison, sold for Pounds 9,350.
The salerooms go to great lengths to check the authenticity of the material
they offer, and a good provenance improves prices greatly. The late Mal
Evans was the 'gofer' of the Beatles, and film of the boys in India sold by
his family realised Pounds 23,100. In the same way, a sign for the Casbah
Club, where the Beatles played when they were still the Quarrymen, sold by
their former drummer, Pete Best, more than doubled its estimate at Pounds
13,750.
There are fashion cycles in pop memorabilia. At one time, merchandising
associated with the Beatles was very popular, and a pair of stockings
decorated with Beatles sold for Pounds 100. Then a warehouse was discovered,
packed with unsold stock, and this sector bombed out. Copies of the Beatles
fan magazine have also proved remarkably prolific.
But scrapbooks kept by adoring fans can still do well. One, whose enthusiasm
lasted from August 1962 to April 1963, accumulated enough rare photos,
letters, and signings to be worth Pounds 4,950 at Christie's. And, after a
period in the doldrums, gold discs made a comeback in the same sale - one,
from a set of perhaps 10, produced to commemorate the sale of 500,000 copies
of Sergeant Pepper, beat its forecast at Pounds 2,200. If it had been a gold
disc given to a Beatle it would have made much more.
Signed photographs and programmes, letters and fanzines, these are the stuff
of pop auctions. Most items sell for Pounds 500 or less. Only the very rare,
the extremely personal, or the obviously valuable momentos make high sums.
The top price ever achieved was the Pounds 1.77m, paid for John Lennon's
psychedelically decorated Rolls-Royce. The second highest is the Pounds
198,000 paid for Jimi Hendrix's Fender guitar.
One area that is growing in popularity is costumes. In August, Sotheby's
sold the gold basque worn by Madonna on her Blond Ambition tour for a modest
Pounds 9,900. By comparison, Elvis Presley's one-piece Shooting Star stage
outfit made Pounds 128,600 - and a pair of Buddy Holly's spectacles, Pounds
26,027. A stage outfit worn by Prince sold for Pounds 9,020 this year, and
even Bob Dylan, whose grumpy personality should scare off fans, saw one of
his jackets sell for Pounds 6,600 in August.
Only in recent sales has memorabilia been offered which is associated with
currently performing artists: the salerooms prefer to rely on the patina of
past reputations. Death also boosts prices, although a Marc Bolan archive
disappointed at Christie's in August. But so flamboyant are Madonna and
Michael Jackson and Prince that they have forced their way into the public
attention while still in full song.
On the back of pop, the auction houses have started to sell the flotsam and
jetsam of the cinema, with Charlie Chaplin's bowler hat realising over
Pounds 80,000 and a Marilyn Monroe dress almost Pounds 20,000. But momentos
of television personalities have failed to excite collectors.
Most treasured scraps from teenage crushes on pop stars are worthless, or
valued at Pounds 200 or less. Yet the auction houses are amazed at the
quality of goods still turning up, especially relating to the Beatles.
In just a few years they seem to have spewed forth memorabilia like a
catherine wheel. British collectors are well placed to turn up treasures
that will be highly valued in Japan, Germany and the US. And even the most
unlikely objects can find a buyer - this year Christie's sold a small piece
of toast left on his breakfast tray by George Harrison 30 years ago.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and the US governments yesterday failed to reach an 'open skies'
agreement but said they would resume negotiations soon to try to liberalise
air transport between the two countries.
After three days of intense negotiations in London, the two sides said there
were still several difficult issues to be resolved before an agreement could
be reached.
No date has yet been fixed for a new round of talks, but the UK department
of transport said the negotiations were expected to resume 'soon'.
Both the Bush administration and the UK government appear keen to reach an
agreement which would clear the way for US government approval of British
Airways' proposed acquisition of a 44 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars
750m.
But the three largest US carriers have mounted a fierce campaign against the
BA-USAir deal, pressing the US not to approve the transaction unless it can
secure greater access to the UK for US airlines.
BA is expected to announce today an agreement to rescue Dan-Air, the
financially troubled independent UK carrier.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ford sees Dollars 174m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD Motor, the US vehicles group, indicated yesterday that it expected to
lose around Dollars 174m in the third quarter.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission Ford said it
expected losses in the period to be 'about Dollars 400m less than the
Dollars 574m loss in the third quarter a year ago'.
The figure is in the middle of analysts' expectations, which range from
around Dollars 110m to Dollars 200m.
Ford, which plans to release its results next week, said it expected
'continued improvement in earnings over 1992, assuming that US and European
economic conditions and industry volumes improve'.
The company also said it had increased the sum it intended to raise under an
offering of perpetual preferred stock from Dollars 1bn to Dollars 1.15bn.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: McDonald's earnings hit new high
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
McDONALD'S, the world's largest hamburger chain, has reported record
third-quarter earnings. Results were strong in both domestic and overseas
operations, despite weak economies in the UK, Japan and several other of
McDonald's markets.
Third-quarter earnings were Dollars 289.2m, or 79 cents per share, up 12 per
cent from Dollars 258.7m, or 71 cents per share, in the same 1991 quarter.
Worldwide sales hit Dollars 1.9bn, up 11 per cent from Dollars 1.78bn last
year.
For the nine months ended September 20, McDonald's reported earnings of
Dollars 730.7m, or Dollars 1.99 per share, up from Dollars 659.2m, or
Dollars 1.80 per share for the same 1991 period. Year-to-date sales were
Dollars 16.2bn.
McDonald's domestic sales rose 5 per cent for the third quarter, and the
nine-month period, but because of value pricing and an increasingly
competitive environment, earnings in the US were flat.
Outside the US, sales rose 23 per cent in the third quarter, due to
restaurant expansion, currency conversions, and higher sales at existing
units. Earnings rose 21 per cent for offshore operations.
The company said sales were particularly strong in Australia, parts of
western Europe, and parts of Asia, including Hong Kong and Singapore.

CONTROL Data Systems reported a modest profit for its first quarter as an
independent company. It is the equipment portion of the former Control Data
Corporation, which was split into two companies in May.
Third-quarter net earnings were Dollars 206,000, or 2 cents per share, on
revenue of Dollars 114m. In the same period last year, when the company was
part of Control Data Corporation, net losses were Dollars 2.8m, or 27 cents
per share, on revenues of Dollars 135.7m.
During the 1992 third quarter, Silicon Graphics, a computer workstation
manufacturer, invested Dollars 14.4m in Control Data Systems for
approximately 10 per cent of the common stock of the new company.
For the first nine months of 1992 the company reported revenues of Dollars
363.6m, down from Dollars 424.8m in the same period of 1991. Net losses were
Dollars 144m, including restructuring charges, compared with net losses of
Dollars 15.6m in the first nine months of 1991.
Sun Microsystems reported a big drop in first quarter earnings. The computer
workstation manufacturer said that high component costs for new products had
lowered its profit margins.
Net income for the first quarter was Dollars 4.8m, or 5 cents per share,
compared to Dollars 26.8m, or 27 cents, for the same period a year ago.
Revenues hit a first quarter record of Dollars 855.9m, up more than 13 per
cent from Dollars 754.9m in the first quarter of 1992.
Wall Street analysts had been projecting net earnings of around 22 cents per
share for the quarter.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (7): Insider tips
don't survive in fresh air - Serious Riches / In any case, the owners of a
field-sports agency for blue-chip clients have their portfolios managed on a
discretionary basis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN THE seriously rich have to relax.
And that is how the business of Christopher Orssich and Mark Firth has come
to prosper. Between them, they now own Roxton Sporting Agency, the biggest
field-sports agency in the UK.
The company, located unobtrusively above a sporting shop in Hungerford,
Berkshire, has a workforce of only eight; but a quick look at its letterhead
shows that it is well-connected - its two non-executive directors are a
senior vice-president of merchant bank JP Morgan, in New York, and Baron
Benjamin de Rothschild, scion of the great European banking dynasty.
Typical clients on the hunting, shooting and fishing expeditions that they
organise in Britain and around the world are of similar financial calibre.
One of the perks of the job is that both of them regularly accompany their
shooting parties, and also scout out new locations before sending out any
new clients.
It's not a bad way to earn a living. However, any thoughts readers might
have that 'inside' information on share prices, which almost invariably
crops up during conversations, is in any way superior to what you can learn
from doing your homework should be dispelled.
A few years ago, Mr Firth tried a totally notional experiment. He recalls:
'One year, just when insider dealing was all the rage, I took all the share
tips I was given and bought a nominal Pounds 1,000-worth of all the dead
certs I was given, and held them as long as I was told to keep them.'
The result of the exercise made him all the happier that he had avoided
temptation - at the end of the day, after brokerage fees had been taken into
account, he would have incurred a 20 per cent loss. So much for inside
information.
All of this explains why both Messrs Orssich and Firth, both now with young
families, have opted to have their share portfolios managed on a fully
discretionary basis. This means that the fund managers only follow
broadly-set instructions, and are not obliged to inform their clients before
buying and selling shares.
Mr Orssich, who had a few highly-pressurised years in the City as a
stockbroker before moving into field sports full-time, uses Murray
Johnstone, the Glasgow-based firm of fund managers which also has an office
in London. He started to keep his portfolio there after several brokers had
moved there from his previous managers, Henderson Administration. He now
uses Murray Johnstone to cover most of his personal finances, and finds
their professional service gives him invaluable peace of mind.
The remit he gives them is taken straight from the guiding principles of
running the business: 'If I had to find a parallel between the shooting
business and the financial world, I would say the great lesson was to deal
with blue-chip stocks mainly.'
For, just as he found large blue-chip companies to be the most reliable, so
the wealthiest and best established clients could be most relied upon to pay
promptly, and to use the service time and again. So Murray Johnstone has
been instructed to aim for blue chips, and avoid anything too speculative.
Murray Johnstone also arranged a charitable educational trust scheme to pay
for school fees. Mr Orssich is aware that inflation is high and can imperil
the assumptions on which such schemes are designed, but he remains confident
that the difficulty of meeting this large expense will be much reduced.
Mr Firth has also now found his way to Murray Johnstone, who are under
similar instructions to keep to blue chips. He also has a portfolio of
American shares, thanks to an inheritance.
A large share of his wealth is tied up in the company, of which he is the
leading shareholder - a tidy stimulus to ensure that everything is done as
efficiently as possible. The company is small and has few overheads, but
there is a medical insurance scheme to cover them.
Some of his previous financial experiences have been less happy. He has a
personal pension with Laurentian Life, into which he has paid Pounds 1,200
per year over the last five years. 'I've now got my five-year valuation for
it and it stands at Pounds 4,800. Contributions so far are Pounds 6,000.'
He means to set up a pension via Murray Johnstone at the end of this year,
but remains deeply unhappy with his current personal pension.
Other insurance dealings have gone rather better for him. Roxton has
negotiated a very good deal on 'pluvius' rain insurance, which is
understandable. Bad weather, which can ruin a day's field sport, poses a
very real and regular threat in many of their locations, but the company now
has a cheap 'bulk' deal.
Mr Firth was also a member, or 'Name', of Lloyd's until 1988, when he left
after a shooting friend who worked as a Name told him that the risk-reward
ratio was going the wrong way. He made a profit for the 1988 underwriting
year, and all his accounts are closed.
However, losses made at Lloyd's by Names who did not withdraw in time have
had a noticeable effect on business this year, as have problems in the
economy in general. Yet in a way, the business is recession-proof. According
to Mr Orssich: 'An average day's shooting is from Pounds 500 to Pounds 1,600
per person. The people who spend that kind of money on a day's sport for
themselves tend to be at the upper end of their profession.'
So, while there are fewer property developers among their clients than there
used to be, demand stays reasonably constant. Plans to expand the business
further are also well advanced. As Mr Firth puts it: 'You can safely say
that the one way to go to any country in the world was to go and shoot
something. I sent people on shooting holidays to Mongolia six years ago. I
was offered woodcock shooting in King Zog's hunting lodge in Albania six
years ago.'
This is one of the less-heralded results of the fall of the Iron Curtain.
Field sports have always been strong in eastern Europe - apparently the late
President Ceausescu of Romania still holds most of the major European big
game records - and the opportunities to expand there have now increased.
Salmon are so plentiful in Russia, compared with Scotland, that many anglers
are willing to go to the trouble of making an expedition to Siberia in
pursuit of the hobby.
A little exploratory zeal in business, and extreme prudence in finance,
should mean that Messrs Orssich and Firth continue to profit to the full
from the thrill of the hunt. And the seriously rich should continue to
derive the relaxation they crave.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (2): The bull market
was the anomaly, not the crash - Black Monday revisited, A salutary
anniversary / Five years on, the lesson of 1987 is that shares are a
commodity, just like anything else
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market crash of October 19, 1987, was perhaps the day when the
1980s free-market dream turned sour. Thatcherism and Reagonomics had
liberalised the financial sector, and it seemed, for a while, that markets
and economies were destined to head ever upwards.
But then the Dow Jones Index fell 508 points in a day, spreading panic to
the rest of the world's stock markets. It took weeks for markets to settle
down and resume some semblance of 'normal' trading. The optimism of the
mid-1980s has yet to return.
Reaction to the crash went through several phases. At first, memories went
back to the Wall Street crash of 1929, which ushered in the great depression
of the 1930s. World governments lowered interest rates, in an attempt to
prevent a repeat of the slump.
Then, as markets stabilised and economies continued to grow, the crash
seemed merely to prove to many that the financial markets were divorced from
the real economy. The only people who had suffered, it appeared, were the
Porsche-driving Yuppies, and few shed any tears for them.
Now that the world economy has gone through its recent traumas, the crash
can be reassessed. It seems to have been an early sign that the deregulation
of the financial system, and a consequent explosion of bank lending, had
resulted in an unsustainable explosion in asset prices. Share markets,
usually a leading indicator, were among the first to discover the worst;
property markets have since been forced to absorb the same lesson.
When banks lend money, they often use assets as security. When asset prices
are rising substantially, it is good business for both banks and borrowers;
and the speculative bubble is inflated further. When the bubble bursts, and
asset prices fall, the banks' 'security' proves illusory; both banks and
borrowers lose heavily.
The 1987 crash proved the undoing of many over-ambitious entrepreneurs who
had borrowed heavily, using shares in their companies as security; their
business empires depended on market values which the crash destroyed.
In retrospect, it seems obvious that it was the bull market of the early
part of 1987, and not the crash of October, which was the remarkable
occurrence. If, at the start of 1987, you had told an equity investor that
the FT-SE 100 Index would rise by 40 per cent over the next five-and-a-half
years, he would probably have been moderately satisfied with the prospect.
In fact, all that rise was achieved in the first six months of 1987; for the
last five years, share prices have struggled to regain, and pass, their
pre-crash levels.
Sadly, most private investors will not have kept up with the market. Many
will have piled their savings into shares and unit trusts in 1987 (July and
September 1987 were the peak months for unit trust sales). They will have
sold out for a loss, disillusioned, before now. Indeed, the average UK unit
growth unit trust fell 16 per cent (even with income reinvested) in the five
years between August 1987 and August 1992.
The private investor always seems to lose out in a bull market. Indeed, it
is almost the definition of a speculative boom when the average man starts
to get excited about investing. The injection of a sudden extra tranche of
demand pushes prices up to unsustainable levels.
The commodity does not seem to matter: there was once a speculative mania in
tulips. But when the next-door neighbour boasts about the profits he has
made in the equity market, it is time to sell.
Of course, the same principle applies to bear markets. The bottom of the
market occurs just when many private investors have finally sold all their
shares in disgust.
It would be wonderful if FT readers could learn the lessons and become
successful contrarians, selling at the top and buying at the bottom.
However, successful contrarians are, by definition, a minority.
Many investors will have given up on equities for good. Indeed, there is a
significant school of thought which argues that bonds, not shares, will be
the top-performing asset category of the current decade. Bond investors have
traditionally been battered by inflation, but the 1990s could be the era of
low inflation (good for bonds) and low economic growth (bad for equities).
Equity enthusiasts would argue that shares will still beat bonds in a low
inflation environment, and indeed there is some historical evidence to that
effect. But retired investors may well decide that the security of gilts,
and the high real interest rates, currently on offer, are too attractive to
miss.
Those who do not depend on their savings for income need to think twice,
however. The tax system still favours equities over gilts, since the former
provide a significant part of their return in capital gains. Most people do
not come even close to using their annual CGT allowance (Pounds 5,800 in
1992-93), so much of their return on equities will be tax-free.
If you are still brave enough to invest in equities, what lessons can you
learn from the Crash?
Equities are only for the long term.
Those who suffered most from the crash were investors who bought at the
height of the bull market and sold out a few months later, when share prices
had tumbled. To long-term equity investors, the crash was merely a blip in
the progress of their fortunes.
According to the BZW equity-gilt study, Pounds 100 invested in equities in
1945 would have grown, with gross income reinvested, to Pounds 28,513 by end
1991. The same sum invested in gilts would have grown to just Pounds 1,209.
Progress for the equity investor has not always been smooth. The original
Pounds 100 rose in value fairly steadily to reach Pounds 1,284 in 1968,
before falling back to Pounds 1,113, rising again to Pounds 1,968 in 1972
and then plummeting calamitously to just Pounds 677 at end 1974.
So those who bought shares in 1972 would thus have seen their wealth eroded
by two-thirds in two years (and the picture is even worse after inflation
and tax). But the BZW figures show that by end 1977, they would have been
back in profit and by end 1980, their wealth would have more than doubled.
Fundamentals cannot be ignored.
Those buying shares in the summer of 1987 were ignoring the evidence of some
of the most fundamental stock market ratios.
When the market reached its peak in July 1987, the yield on the FT-A
All-Share index fell to 2.85 per cent. That level had only been reached
before in 1972, just before the start of the 1973-74 bear market - which
should have been a warning sign. Since yields have an inverse relationship
to share prices, when yields are historically low, the obvious corollary is
that shares are historically expensive. The average yield on the All-Share
since 1965 has been around 5 per cent.
Another fundamental factor is the relationship between returns on gilts and
those on shares. In the summer of 1987, this ratio was 3.2 - in other words,
you could get three times the income return on gilts that was available on
shares. For much of the late 1970s and 1980s, the ratio had varied between 2
and 2.5.
So, in 1987, gilts looked much more attractive relative to shares than they
had previously; either gilts were cheap or shares were expensive (or a
combination of the two). But investors were carried away with the
exhilaration of the bull market.
Stock market movements are often handy indicators of future economic
problems.
The 1987 Crash does seem to have been a warning of the unsustainability of
the 1980s boom and the debt-related problems we have suffered in the 1990s.
Note also how, in 1990, politicians and most economists were telling us
there would be no recession. But the stock market fell over the year - for
the first time since 1976. Not that the markets are infallible. The stock
market rise in 1991 anticipated an illusory recovery in 1992. So perhaps
markets are better predictors on the downside than on the upside.
Shares are a commodity like anything else.
Why did investors rush into equities in 1987? Because they had risen in
price. Normally, a buying spree by consumers only occurs when prices are
'cheap', such as a January sale. It was strange logic that saw investors buy
shares because they were expensive. Evidently they felt that the normal
rules did not apply to shares. The crash proved otherwise.
In time, the cycle will come round again. Investors will gradually forget
the excesses of the 1987 bull market; soon the crash will have dropped out
of unit and investment trust five-year performance figures. In the 21st
century some time, some new economic consensus will determine that the world
is headed for self-sustaining growth; and thus traders will argue that the
old stock market ratios no longer apply. Yields will fall to new lows and a
new crash will come due.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (6): Compensation
took three years - Hindsight / When a pension transfer was misused, help was
needed from many quarters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN FEBRUARY 1989, John Brewer, a company director from Nottinghamshire,
received a shocking letter from the managing director of his brokers:
'Dear Mr Brewer, I am most truly sorry to say that I have let you down very
badly. I have used part of your pension transfers to keep my business
afloat. I have no excuses for this. The reason I am telling you now is that
I am going to make amends and to cease trading.
'My wife Jennifer knew nothing of this and I am truly sorry.'
That letter was the starting signal for a three-year fight for compensation.
Mr Brewer had to wait until April 23 this year before he received a cheque
to reimburse him for all that had been stolen.
Consumers can take heart from the fact that the compensation eventually
arrived - but the details of the intervening three years, which were spent
haggling with life companies, solicitors, bailiffs and regulators, are
harrowing.
Mr Brewer only gained compensation after enlisting the support of his new
financial advisers, Towry Law, and his MP, Mr Kenneth Clarke, now the home
secretary.
He had first had contact with Upperstock, the broker, when arranging
insurance for his textiles company. Upperstock had converted his business
partner's pension funds into one fund, and transferred them to Devonshire
Life, a life company which is now part of Acuma.
Mr Brewer, already aged over 60, was advised to do the same, and did so. He
gave instructions for the funds from his three pension schemes - with Allied
Dunbar, Standard Life and Target Life, totalling Pounds 30,060.36 - to be
transferred in a lump-sum single payment to Devonshire Life.
In July 1988, Upperstock wrote to him saying that the lump sum had been paid
to Devonshire Life. This was not true.
The next six months were spent unhappily trying to gain confirmation of the
deal from both the broker and the product provider. Devonshire Life said it
could only give information to its agent. Upperstock procrastinated - the
papers, it claimed, were being processed, lost in the post, or left on the
desk.
In fact, Upperstock was engaged in a juggling act. The pension plan it had
opened involved regular monthly premiums of Pounds 2,500, to be dribbled
slowly into the new pension plan. This was a far worse deal for Mr Brewer
than a straightforward lump-sum investment would have been. But Upperstock
could use the balance to keep the brokerage afloat.
A total of Pounds 12,500 was paid to Devonshire Life before the policy
lapsed in November - three months before Upperstock admitted that there was
any problem at all.
Under the original terms of the contract, the policy could lapse without
value. Thus Devonshire Life initially declined to pay any compensation.
But in May 1990, after the company had been taken over by Acuma, and after
permission had been received from the Inland Revenue, the Pounds 12,500 was
finally paid to him.
However, the life company could scarcely be expected to provide the rest of
the money, totalling almost Pounds 20,000, which had never been paid to it.
The other avenue he pursued was to retrieve the money directly from Mr
Raymond Gorman, the managing director of Upperstock. He had initially
offered to sell his house, and reimburse Mr Brewer with the proceeds.
Mr Brewer employed solicitors to obtain a charge over his broker's property
 -an expensive and time-consuming process. But his hopes had been cruelly
raised.
Three lenders had prior charges over the house, and in any case the house
could not be sold at auction. It was eventually repossessed by the building
society, nullifying all the expensive efforts which had been made to obtain
a charge on the building - the solicitors' bill was Pounds 1,036.27.
His verdict on the solicitors is blunt: 'They achieved nothing and cost me a
lot of money.'
Fortunately, Towry Law, whom he had approached for financial advice,
reported the matter to the regulators. Upperstock had been authorised by
Fimbra, the watchdog for independent intermediaries, and so the matter was
covered by the Investors Compensation Scheme.
Mr Brewer was entitled to think that he had an open and shut case - after
all, the broker had written to him to admit embezzlement.
But he was not prepared for the painstaking process which unfolded. Working
with the Investors Compensation Scheme was no easier than with the
solicitors.
Towry Law first contacted Fimbra in October 1989. Fimbra wrote to Mr Brewer
for the first time six months later.
At the end of May, the ICS wrote to him for the first time, with a list of
eight questions. He answered them by return of post. From then on, the
watchdogs, to use Mr Brewer's own words, 'kept moving the goalposts'. 'Every
time you thought you had got there, they moved the goals again.'
In January 1991 - almost two years after receiving his broker's mea culpa -
the ICS wrote to tell him that there could still be no guarantee of
compensation, because Upperstock was not in formal insolvent liquidation.
They failed to provide him with any more explanation, so Mr Brewer now wrote
to Kenneth Clarke. Mr Clarke then gave the regulators a hefty prod.
Unfortunately, the law was also a problem. A dispute between Fimbra and the
Securities and Investments Board over exactly who was eligible for
compensation needed to be settled at the High Court, and Mr Brewer's claim
had to be put on ice. Meanwhile, in April 1991, the ICS sent him two
follow-up questions - 11 months after receiving his replies to the first
eight.
Mr Brewer answered them by return of post. Five weeks later, the ICS sent
him another seven questions to answer.
Now, at last, things seemed to be moving. The High Court decided to take a
broad view of the scope of the ICS rules, meaning that he was eligible for
compensation. Then, in September, Upperstock was declared formally in
default.
Mr Brewer breathed a sigh of relief. After 30 months, he was at last going
to receive his money.
A month later, the ICS sent him a 'preliminary information form'. Aghast
that matters were still only 'preliminary', he filled it in and sent it by
return of post. Was relief finally at hand?
It was not. He spent the next four months providing formal authority for the
ICS to gain access to the records of the insurance companies involved. Then,
in April, he had to make a formal oath that the information he had provided
was true.
Compensation - including interest - did not arrive until April this year. Mr
Brewer remains very grateful to Towry Law, and to Kenneth Clarke.
'Ultimately, I'm happy that I've been adequately compensated, but the
regulators took too long to do so and caused a lot of worry. It's a big
shock to find you have lost such a big sum of money so easily.'
In particular, he believes the ICS process could be streamlined down to
filling in one form. But at least the compensation arrived, in time for Mr
Brewer and his wife to start their retirement. 'It was a once-in-a-lifetime
experience, I hope. I can look back and laugh about it now.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / Political battle in Moscow becomes heated
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE roaring political row in Russia continued yesterday, as Russian
President Boris Yeltsin warned the parliament against 'skidding to the
right' and General Alexander Rutskoi, the vice-president, demanded the
immediate sacking of six cabinet ministers and said that the privatisation
plan was designed to 'rob the country'.
The level of polemics has become increasingly bitter, as the pro- and
anti-government camps increasingly cast aside restraint. The government side
is very much on the defensive, warning of efforts to destabilise the cabinet
and the presidency - while the opposition, having refused the request from
Mr Yeltsin to postpone an inevitably hostile Congress of People's Deputies
from December to spring, is now hotly demanding cabinet resignations.
Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, one of three ministers under fire from
parliament for briefing foreign journalists on the likelihood of a move
against Mr Yeltsin, repeated his charges yesterday in and out of parliament.
Earlier, he had said that his warnings of efforts by hardline forces to
'introduce nationalism and chauvinism' were meant to alert Mr Yeltsin to the
threat to his position. 'It is not so much a matter of attacks on the
government, but of efforts to unseat the president himself - the only
legitimate representative of the Russian people'.
Gen Rutskoi was reported by a Moscow newspaper as saying that the question
of the cabinet should be considered on the first day of the congress.
Meanwhile, a statement from the doctor of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary speaker, said that he was suffering from 'extreme exhaustion'
caused by intensive work, sleep restricted to five hours a day and heavy
smoking. On Wednesday, a group of democratic deputies said that they
believed Mr Khasbulatov had been under the influence of drink or drugs,
following a meeting with him after he had been led from the parliament.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Serbian rivals face the final showdown: Milosevic is capable
of pushing the Serbs into civil war if he fails to get his way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE final showdown between the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, and
the Yugoslav authorities is approaching following the seizure this week by
Serb police of the federal interior ministry in Belgrade.
That action proved that Mr Milosevic, although increasingly isolated, will
stop at nothing to remain in power. It also indicated that he was ready to
use force in his power struggle against Mr Dobrica Cosic, the Yugoslav
president, and Mr Milan Panic, the federal prime minister.
The latter are attempting to strengthen the constitutional powers of the
rump Yugoslavia at the expense of eroding Serbia's powers. Mr Milosevic may
use the attempt, however, to try to destroy the federation, rather than
relinquish power
Mr Milosevic is backed by a 50,000-strong police force and thousands of
paramilitary fighters, veterans of the war in Croatia and Bosnia, while the
top echelons of the army support Mr Cosic. The loyalty of the lower and
mid-ranking officers is not known.
Mr Milosevic's main pillars of political support include the Socialist
(former communist) party, and its ultra-nationalist satellite parties;
Serbian state television; and many managers of state enterprises who are
political appointees and who see their fate depending on the survival of Mr
Milosevic.
Opposition leaders, intellectuals, and the Serbian Orthodox Church have
already called on Mr Milosevic to resign. They have thrown their support
behind Mr Cosic, a well-known writer who is seen as the spiritual father of
all Serbs. Montenegro, the other republic in the new Yugoslavia, has also
swung behind the federal government.
With these battle lines clearly drawn, and a showdown increasingly likely,
as Mr Panic warned yesterday, the Serbian leadership is increasingly
clashing with the Yugoslav government at every step. For instance, whenever
any progress is made at the peace talks in Geneva, Mr Milosevic, through his
nationalist allies, repeatedly tries to derail the process by challenging
the authority of President Cosic and Mr Panic.
Following the Geneva agreement for the Yugoslav army to withdraw from
Prevlaka, Croatia's southern Adriatic peninsula, Mr Milosevic sharply
criticised President Cosic.
Mr Milosevic has also tried to undermine Mr Panic's moves towards a
reconciliation with ethnic Albanian leaders of Kosovo, who, if provoked by
Serbia, could rebel in Serbia's southern province.
Kosovo's Serbs, who make up 8 per cent of the 2.1m population, are backed by
a powerful police apparatus, and still revere the Serbian president for
ruthlessly bringing the province under the direct control of Belgrade in
1990.
But Mr Cosic, a grandmaster of Balkan politics, understands Mr Milosevic's
Machiavellian manoeuvres, and is prepared to abandon Serbia's policy of war
in order to rejoin the international community. In an address to the federal
parliament last week, Mr Cosic warned of the dangers of civil war in Serbia,
and called for the immediate disarming of political parties and paramilitary
groups, which are armed by Mr Milosevic and his allies.
However, the key disadvantage of the federal government is that it does not
exert enough control to disband the fighters. The seizure of the interior
ministry by Serb police was Mr Milosevic's way of showing he is still boss
of Serbia.
Yet despite Serbian television's smear campaign against Mr Panic, and to a
lesser extent Mr Cosic, the two men appear to have gained popular support in
contrast to Mr Milosevic, whose popularity has slumped following a year of
war - and the imposition of United Nations sanctions which are precipitating
economic collapse.
The average annual wage has plummeted from Dollars 3,000 (Pounds 1,840) per
capita to Dollars 1,000; Belgrade economists estimate that sanctions will
reduce industrial output by a further 50 per cent over the next few months;
300,000 workers have been laid off; and hundreds of thousands of workers are
expected to be sacked by the end of the year, increasing the possibility of
social unrest.
The most obvious obstacle to stability in Serbia and the former Yugoslavia
remains Mr Milosevic. Pushed into a corner, he is at his most dangerous,
believing he has nothing to lose by dragging Serbia into a civil war.
Indeed, he is prepared to break up the reconstituted Yugoslavia, following
the same pattern used with Croatia and Bosnia. Then, Mr Milosevic showed
that if he could not dominate the federation, he was willing to destroy it.
All expectations that Mr Milosevic would resign under foreign and domestic
pressure so far have proven false. He remains the most powerful politician
in the Balkans. The chance for peace in the region hinges on the outcome of
the power struggle in Belgrade.

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE resignation from parliament of Mr Antonis Samaras, a former foreign
minister, has boosted the beleaguered Greek government's chances of
defeating its populist critics on the question of recognition for the
ex-Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, writes Kerin Hope in Athens.
Mr Samaras, whose hardline views on Macedonia are rejected by the prime
minister, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, stood down on Wednesday night after a
stormy meeting of the ruling New Democracy's parliamentary group.
The government's one-seat majority in the 300-member Parliament remains
safe, as another ND politician will fill the empty seat. There are no
provisions in Greece for holding by-elections.
Mr Samaras was sacked as foreign minister last April for advocating that
Greece should close the border with Macedonia unless the Skopje government
agreed to change the country's name.
Greece wants Macedonia to choose another name for international use, to
avoid implying a territorial claim on the Greek province of the same name.
With Mr Samaras out of the way, the prime minister can try to win popular
support for his compromise on a double name for Macedonia.
However, the government would again be in serious danger if the European
Community reverses its decision last June not to recognise Macedonia under
its present name.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK warns Gibraltar on EC's regulations
</HEADLINE>

   MADRID, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Government has told Gibraltar that it must implement the European
Community's single market regulations even if they appear to undermine its
aspirations of becoming an international offshore financial services centre,
write Tom Burns in Madrid and Robert Mauthner in London.
Britain argues that, since Gibraltar is still a crown colony, albeit with
certain self-governing powers, it is the UK which is responsible for the
implementation of EC decisions. London has stressed that it is the UK
government which would be arraigned before the European Court if Gibraltar
failed to apply EC rules.
The Gibraltarians, however, do not see the problem in quite the same light
and, in tough discussions with British officials, have made clear their deep
reservations about applying some EC rules.
In addition to the longstanding fears among Gibraltar's 30,000 population
over Spain's claim to the colony, there is now concern over a possible
constitutional crisis should London and the EC try to enforce their views.
Mr Joe Bossano, Gibraltar's chief minister, warned this week that, if the
colony's economic progress was hampered by major differences with London,
the situation could become 'critical.'
Mr Bossano said that although no decision had yet been taken by London, the
issue has been brought to a head by Gibraltar's ambivalent status as a
dependency of an EC state.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Nations relief flights to the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo
started again yesterday in a desperate effort to build up stockpiles before
the winter sets in.
'We have no choice but to resume the flights. We are trying to minimise the
risks to the pilots. The land routes from Split across Bosnia have been
closed,' said Mr Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for
Refugees in Geneva.
All flights were suspended on Wednesday after fighting escalated throughout
Bosnia. The suspension fuelled fears that the city's 390,000 inhabitants
risked death, not only from constant bombardment from the surrounding hills
which are held by Serb forces, but from the bitter cold and starvation. Mr
Redmond said temperatures were likely to slip several degrees below zero by
this weekend.
Fighting in western Bosnia between Croat and Moslem forces disrupted all
overland aid convoys earlier this week. Instead, the UNHCR will try to enter
Bosnia from Belgrade, the Serbian capital, at the weekend. The UNHCR plans
to fly in 18 flights a day to Sarajevo, but the onset of winter, coupled
with heavy fog, which settles on the city for several days at a time, could
slow the operation.
'The people need not only food and medicine but covering for their windows,'
said Mr Redmond. He added that 150,000 apartments needed plastic sheeting.
In neighbouring Croatia, European Community monitors yesterday confirmed
that Croatian army units had launched an offensive around the Prevlaka
peninsula on the Adriatic.
The clashes followed the withdrawal of Yugoslav federal troops from the
peninsula under an agreement signed in Geneva by the presidents of Croatia
and the rump Yugoslavia.
The EC monitors, who were confined to their hotel by Croat forces during the
offensive, said Croatian artillery units fired on Bosnian Serb positions
holding Croatian territory.
The EC team lodged a strong protest with the Croatian government because
Croat special army units were using white vehicles similar to those used by
the EC, thus endangering the lives of the monitors.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (5): A tax refuge
that offers flexibility and income - The experts' panel, Single-premium
investment bonds / It may be convenient to switch between funds, but Peps
have reinforced the unit-trust alternative
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGLE-PREMIUM investment bonds are often referred to as the life assurance
industry's answer to unit trusts.
Their chief selling point used to be their tax status. The bonds pay
corporation and capital gains tax within the fund, but this means that the
investor's income tax is treated as having been paid. Therefore, no
basic-rate income tax, and no capital gains tax, need be paid on the lump
sum proceeds of a bond. It is also possible to withdraw up to 5 per cent of
the value of the original investment as income each year, with any tax
liability postponed until the bond is encashed.
Their other big selling point is flexibility - you can switch between
unit-linked funds within one bond, usually free of charge, making life much
easier than it is for those who wish to switch between unit trusts.
However, the introduction of personal equity plans (Peps) has made unit
trusts much more tax-efficient, while the high charges and commissions
associated with life assurance products also weigh down on single-premium
bonds. Do they still have a place?
David Harris, of Chantrey Financial Services, says it is difficult to
generalise, but points out that, according to an individual's circumstances,
there are still many cases in which the bonds can be useful as a
tax-planning tool. Charges and investment performance are the two criteria
he uses when selecting a company.
He says: 'The Scottish Equitable Bond has a low initial investment level of
Pounds 1,000 and will accept additional investments of Pounds 500. The
contract can be split into identical policies of only Pounds 100, which
could prove a useful tax-planning tool. The bond offers the facility to
invest in up to 13 funds, including an ethical fund and an index-linked fund
investing mainly in government securities. The majority of funds offered by
Scottish Equitable appear in the top quartile of investment performance for
medium to longer-term capital growth.
'The Skandia Life contract has a slightly higher minimum initial investment
of Pounds 3,000, and will accept additional investments of Pounds 1,000. The
major feature of this contract is its outstanding and unrivalled choice of
investment fund links. There are currently over 250 funds to choose from,
managed by the major investment management houses in the UK. There is access
to unit trusts, investment trusts, index tracker and building society funds,
and switching between funds may take place without administrative charges.
'Skandia Life also produce a comprehensive range of trust wordings, and the
bond may be used as the basis for specialist inheritance-tax planning
schemes or as a single-premium whole life policy for inheritance-tax
planning.'
John Bridel, of Towry Law, points out that Money Management, the
professional advisers' magazine, lists more than 1,000 different funds, so
that independent advice is essential.
He says: 'The majority of investment in the 1980s in this sector was into
accumulation funds, where the income earned from the capital investments is
accumulated on a daily basis and reflected in the unit price. Hence, if
withdrawals are made for 'income', then units are encashed and the number of
units held within the investment reduced. This is all very well when values
are increasing, but less attractive in a falling market.
'The most popular type of fund is the managed fund, where the managers
spread the investments between equities, property and fixed interest and
between various geographic sectors. Our current recommendation is Allied
Dunbar Managed, due to its consistent unit-linked performance.'
Mr Bridel also often recommends distribution bonds: 'These separate income
from capital so that, unlike accumulation bonds, withdrawals can be made
without encashing the units purchased by the original capital investment. In
addition, such bonds are often designed to produce an above-average income,
and invested in a portfolio including gilts and other fixed interest, income
shares of investment trusts and high-yielding equities. This is a relatively
defensive mix, and has done well over the last five years when stock market
returns have generally been disappointing. Our current recommendation is the
Sun Life Distribution Bond, which is a consistently strong high-income
performer and has defensive qualities.'
John Cole, Managing Director of Berry Birch &amp; Noble, finds the allure of
investment bonds diminished.
'We are certainly recommending the use of investment bonds to our clients
less frequently than in the 1970s and early 1980s,' he says. 'The particular
attraction then was that the underlying investment in the bond could be left
to grow, with no additional income tax applying to a higher-rate taxpayer
until funds were withdrawn.
'Whilst all of these attractions remain, their importance has lessened as
tax rates have reduced and more tax-efficient areas, such as Peps and Tessas
have been launched. These days the performance of the underlying investment
has taken on a central role, rather than relying to such a large extent on
tax incentives.
'Switching can be a dangerous game, and it does not pay to be too
aggressive. Broadly-based managed funds have their attractions, and
certainly there are a number which have performed consistently well over the
years. The CCM Vanguard Fund through NM and managed by Capel Cure Myers has
been a top performer over more than 10 years and is one of our current
recommendations. Similarly, the Sun Life Distribution Fund has a creditable
long-term track record.
'Adaptations of investment bonds would include the Sun Alliance Protector
Bond, where investment is made in the top 100 UK companies with a guarantee
of returning at least the value of the initial investment after four years.
Then there is the Providence Capitol Building Society Bond, which offers a
variable rate of return linked to building societies but is currently
standing at a very acceptable 8.3 per cent, net of basic rate tax.'
Robert Noble-Warren, of Murray Noble, admits: 'I've always had a sneaking
affection for single-premium bonds, ever since I learned how easy it is for
them to transfer one's investment from one market to another. In times of
trouble, it seemed to me, it makes a lot of sense to keep your options open
and be able to scoot off to a safe deposit fund.
'Practically all single-premium bonds now offered by life companies provide
switching facilities like this, and the dealing costs are really very
reasonable. But it does not always work out in life like it says in the
brochure. I remember, over the October 1987 crash, trying to get a price for
some of our clients to move them to fixed interest. I was given the option
of dealing at the next day's price (which I had a horrible feeling would be
down 15 per cent), or next week's price (which, in the furore of the crash,
was outrageously far in the future).
'Today, almost every life company deals at the next (daily) valuation. This
gives them a certain advantage, which I'm not sure they always use with
total impartiality.
'Secondly, I appreciate the chance to use single-premium bonds in tax
planning. Where a client is on the borderline of not quite using all their
personal allowances, it is pleasing to be able to give them more income
without breaking their right to have a gross-paying building society
account. For retired couples, such withdrawals will not prejudice their
claim for old-age allowance (which is restricted when income rises above a
certain level).'
Mr Noble-Warren is also enthusiastic about their uses when held offshore,
for those who are taking up overseas employment. Proceeds can then be cashed
with no UK tax liability. Two companies which Murray Noble often uses for
this purpose are Albany Life and Clerical Medical International.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (4):  Baby-talk at
the checkout - The Plowshares / In which John plans a nest-egg for his
godson, and Mr Stagge suggests the friendly approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JOHN PLOWSHARE is spending a happy Saturday morning at his favourite
domestic chore, the weekly family shop at the supermarket.
He is rarely allowed to do this on his own, but today he has managed to
shake off his wife Alison at the garden centre. He is ensconced at the
biscuit section, when a hearty voice hails him from tinned goods.
It's Mark Stagge, of John's stockbroker Stagge &amp; Hoppitt, clearly in relaxed
weekend mode.
John realises that their encounter is fortuitous. 'I've been meaning to give
you a ring,' he tells Mark. 'I'm going to be godfather to the child of a
friend of ours. I thought it would be a good idea to put a bit of cash away
for him on a regular basis, and I wondered if there was a more intelligent
way of doing it than just putting it in the building society.'
Mark's gives a large grin. 'It's interesting you should ask, because I've
just been through exactly this decision-making process for my nephew.'
The pair advance round the supermarket, pushing their trollies and
discussing ways of giving money to a child. By the time they reach frozen
foods, they have agreed on the main point: that this is money the child must
not be able to touch until he is at least 18, by which time it should be
sufficient for him to use in paying for further education or as a deposit on
a house.
John is interested to hear that Mark is not keen to commit too much money to
his nephew: 'I think about Pounds 200 a year should do it. And I feel that I
want to make small regular payments, rather than a lump sum.'
John, still feeling rather short of cash in these recessionary times, is
happy to agree.
Mark explains that one of the most popular ways of saving on a child's
behalf is through National Savings, particularly the Children's Bonus Bond.
However, despite its many attractions, the bond is not available as a
regular savings plan. Moreover, the maximum holding for each child is Pounds
1,000.
Nor is Mark convinced that a fixed-interest savings product will produce the
best returns for his nephew's savings. 'Longer term,' he says, 'I believe
equities will provide a better return.'
Consequently, Mark had asked around, and found that a friend of his was
saving for his niece through a friendly society. 'This,' he explains, 'is a
society registered under the Friendly Societies Act, which exists for the
provision of certain mutual benefits and tax-exempt savings products for
children and families.
'Apparently, this friend got a mailshot with teddy bears all over it, and
found that friendly societies offer regular savings plans for children.
'These are designed to run for a minimum of 10 years, but they can be
adapted to allow for saving over 15 years - which is perfect timing for me,
because my nephew is six at the moment, so he'll be 21 when the plan runs
out. You can contribute up to a maximum of Pounds 200 a year and, best of
all, you can pay by direct debit.'
Mark and John have now reached the wine department, and there is a lull in
the conversation as they engage in that part of the shopping which requires
particularly serious thought. As they reach the tonic water, Mark resumes:
'These plans are totally tax-free. This means that, when young Tarquin
reaches the ripe old age of 21, he can either sell the policy and take all
the proceeds tax-free, or elect to take a regular tax-free income and leave
the balance to grow further. Alternatively, he can leave the money to grow
tax-free until the lump sum is most needed.
'A further advantage is that the money can be invested in a managed equity
fund, which suits my investment approach, combining both aims of achieving
security and above-average capital growth. What's more, the tax-free
environment means that growth could be even higher.'
'Need all the money go into equities?' asks John, warily.
'No. There's a choice of a unit-linked or a with-profits plan. I've chosen a
managed fund, in which case, the money goes into a mixture of UK and
international equities, fixed-interest stock, gilts and property.'
The pair have finally reached that place of great stress, the supermarket
check-out. So it is not surprising that John's thoughts turn in a certain
direction:
'What about charges?'
'You might at first consider them a trifle high,' admits Mark. Typical
charges on a unit-linked regular savings plan with a friendly society would
be: the 5 per cent bid-offer spread, a 0.75 per cent annual management
charge, and a 40p-50p handling charge on each premium if you pay monthly.'
John is slightly taken aback. 'I hope that's all?'
'Not quite. The initial cost is between 40 and 50 per cent of the first
year's premium - that's the cost of setting up the plan.'
'Yes, they do sound a bit on the high side,' observes John, signing his
credit-card slip with the check-out girl's ballpoint.
'But what you must remember,' explains Mark, 'is that these plans are meant
to run over 10 to 15 years. Then the charges don't seem nearly as fierce.'
As they push their trollies across the car park, a further thought occurs to
John: 'What if I want to stop the contributions? Say I can't afford it - or
I find that I have a prodigal godson?'
'You can stop at any point and cash it in, and as godparent you'll get the
money in trust for your godchild. But during years one to 10, because it's a
tax-free device, you can't have back more than you put in. After year 10,
you can have the value of the units tax-free.
'Alternatively, you could make the plan paid-up, so that the money stays
where it is until the child is 16, when he can have it.'
Since their cars are at opposite ends of the car park, the conversation
ends.
'Give me a call if you want any more advice,' says Mark, as he moves off in
the direction of his K-reg Granada.
John, persuaded that the friendly society route at least deserves
consideration, pauses to make a note on the back of Alison's shopping list:
'Ring M at S &amp; H'

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (1): Don't go back
to the old ways yet - Keynote / Equities and houses may again look tempting.
But beware - the recession still has some way to go
</HEADLINE>

AT THE beginning of July, you could buy 2.90 Deutsche Marks or nearly 9.8
French francs for your pound, and in a speech on the tenth of that month
chancellor of the exchequer Norman Lamont fiercely attacked proponents of a
'cut and run' policy for interest rates and the exchange rate. The
credibility of the UK's anti-inflationary policy, he insisted, 'would be in
tatters'.
Well, by the end of the quarter the tatters were flapping noisily in a gale
force wind. On Black Wednesday, September 16, the pound was forced out of
the European Community's exchange rate mechanism. By the end of the month
the sterling exchange rate was falling through DM2.50 and FFr8.50, declines
of some 13 per cent over the three months, and it has dropped further since
then.
It has been a traumatic time for investors, who have been faced with violent
fluctuations in the markets and have had to decide hastily whether to make
fundamental shifts in their portfolio structure.
A portfolio designed for the ERM would have been heavily defensive and
geared towards fixed-income securities, which promised to pay off well in
conditions of declining inflation. Government long-dated securities, for
instance, yielded just over 9 per cent in early July, against underlying
inflation of little more than 4 per cent. That inflation rate appeared
likely to fall to between 2 and 3 per cent within a year, and prime minister
John Major was rashly holding out the promise of zero inflation in due
course.
News of a further slight contraction in the economy during the previous
quarter, however, dashed the one-time hopes of a post-election revival, and
served to put pressure on the stock market. It also began to undermine the
whole credibility of the government's economic strategy in the opinion of
foreign exchange traders.
Events moved surprisingly quickly as a classic summer foreign exchange
crisis began to engulf the whole of Europe. The trigger was the setting by
the French government of September 20 as the date for the referendum on the
Maastricht Treaty.
Fundamental misalignments within the ERM - notably, overvaluation of the
lira and the pound - had been tolerated by the markets for some time, but
the developing political crisis began to encourage banks and corporate
treasurers all around the globe to reassess the risks and to shift their
positions towards the safety of the DM.
In London, share prices, already depressed by the crumbling of the economy,
began to retreat at the prospect of a battle to save sterling. The Footsie
index fell from 2521.2 on June 30 to hit the year's low of 2281.0 on August
25, a drop of almost 10 per cent. The day before Black Wednesday it was
little higher, but as it became clear that the government could not save the
pound share prices began to rally. Temporary threats of 15 per cent interest
rates made no difference, because they were regarded as incredible. As
sterling was cast adrift, share prices jumped and by the end of September
the Footsie was back up to around 2550, actually a 1 per cent advance over
the three months.
Shares have a long tradition as hedges against devaluation, and against the
domestic inflation that nearly always follows along behind. But on the other
hand, bonds, such as the government's gilts, are highly vulnerable to
inflation. Thus gilts, which had been making gains right up to the middle of
September, were suddenly in headlong retreat. As Norman Lamont had unwisely
spelt out two months earlier, it began to look ominously like 'the end of
the battle with inflation'.
Institutional investors rushed to adjust their portfolio structures into a
post-ERM mode, buying foreign currency bonds and, at home, diving rather
clumsily into index-linked gilts, the only corner of the gilt-edged market
that offers protection against inflation.
Index-linked gilts tend to be traded only on a small scale, and in the past
year or two there has often been more interest from private investors (for
whom they offer great security and tax efficiency) rather than the big
institutions. By mid- September the real interest rate (the return over and
above inflation) offered by index-linked gilts had drifted up to an amazing
4 3/4 per cent. But in the next two weeks that real yield tumbled by more
than half a percentage point, and in fact index-linked gilts turned out to
be the best-performing of all the significant domestic investment categories
in the third quarter - which was not, however, saying a great deal.
As the government opted, however reluctantly, for the 'cut and run' option,
investors obviously had to adjust their views on future inflation. Just
before Black Wednesday, the gap between the yield on fixed-coupon and
index-linked gilts (which is the best available measure of the market's
expectation of inflation) narrowed to about 4 per cent. It subsequently
widened to 5 1/2 per cent.
With sterling crashing, better pickings were naturally available to
investors overseas. A simple D-Mark deposit account would have given a
return of 17 per cent or so to a UK domestic investor. Returns of about 20
per cent were available in some of the overseas bond markets. However,
overseas stock markets were often moderately weak, and so local share price
losses offset part of the gains in terms of sterling. For example, the
FT-Actuaries world index, in sterling, showed only a modest capital gain of
8 per cent during the July-September quarter (but spare a thought for German
investors, who saw the world index fall by 6 per cent in D-Mark terms).
Still, the world's sickliest major stock market, Tokyo, picked itself up
from the bottom in mid-August with the help of a Japanese government
economic rescue package. The FT-A Japan index was up 8 per cent during the
third quarter in yen, and by 21 per cent in sterling.
At home there was a glimmer of light in the gloom. Amidst all the currency
mayhem, sterling interest rates eventually fell by a percentage point on
September 22, giving a modicum of relief to millions of mortgage borrowers.
Cheaper money - together with the potential boost for exporters from
devaluation - gave some hope that the economy might begin to recover. It has
to be said, however, that the evidence emerging in the third quarter
indicated that the economy was slipping further into recession.
Certainly, house prices were continuing to fall steadily. But should
investors nevertheless re-embrace their old 1970s and 1980s philosophy and
concentrate their resources in houses and equities, in the belief that these
assets have proven value in an inflationary economy?
It is beginning to look that way, but first the bottom of the recession has
still to be weathered. Until it becomes clear exactly how bad it is going to
be, asset prices, like Norman Lamont's reputation, could continue to look a
little ragged.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (28): Faraway places
offer rewards and hazards - Investment Trusts / As developing countries
liberalise their economies, there should be higher investment returns. But
spread the risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT fashions come and go, but one of the most recent trends has been
the appeal of 'emerging markets'.
The concept is relatively simple. The economies of developing countries tend
to grow at a faster rate than those of the industrialised nations.
Many of these countries have now discovered the benefits of capitalism, and
are liberalising their economies to encourage both the growth of stock
markets and foreign investment.
The combination of fast-growing economies and private sector expansion
should lead to higher investment returns.
That, at least, is the theory. Problems arise in practice because stock
markets in such countries are underdeveloped, and share-trading lacks
liquidity. Accountancy standards are often less rigorous, and political
instability is commonplace. The result is alarmingly volatile stock markets.
In such markets, investment trusts have an important function to play. They
(and their unit-trust brethren) will represent the only practical means of
buying shares in such markets for all but the most intrepid private
investor. And the 'closed end' nature of an investment trust means that it
is not forced to sell shares in an illiquid market in order to repay
investors; it can afford to be patient.
Of course, there is still plenty of risk involved. That particularly applies
to those funds which concentrate on a single country. The danger is that the
trust is launched at a time when that country is 'fashionable', which
effectively means that share prices have already risen substantially.
Investors pile into the issue, and since the trust represents one of the few
ways of gaining access to the market, the shares trade at a premium to asset
value.
Then, inevitably, the market tumbles, the country goes out of fashion, and
the investor faces a 'double whammy' - a falling asset value and shares
which fall from premium into discount.
These risks can be reduced by investing in one of the global emerging
markets trusts, which have shares in a wide range of countries. Except on
very rare occasions (such as the 1987 crash), emerging markets do not seem
to move in unison.
Over the three years to September 1, Templeton Emerging Markets is the top
investment trust in this small sector with a 70.4 per cent gain; over two
years, the regional Latin American Trust is top with a 65.7 per cent
increase. But it seems likely, as the decade progresses, that more funds
will be offered to investors in this field.
WHEN SPLIT-CAPITALS ARE RESTRUCTURED
THE WORLD of split-capital investment trusts is complex enough. But the
process of restructuring a split trust can be the financial equivalent of
sub-atomic physics.
The issue is nevertheless important to those many private investors who
backed trusts on the grounds of their tax efficiency and the set wind-up
date. If, when that date comes, instead of getting cash, those investors
merely get another security with a new wind-up date several years hence,
financial plans may be disrupted.
Why are the lives of split-capital trusts extended? A cynic's answer would
be that it is in the interests of the managers and directors to do so,
because they will continue to receive their fees.
The industry's defenders would counter-argue that extension can often be in
the shareholder's interests. Those who have made extensive capital gains can
postpone paying tax, if they 'roll over' their gain into a new security,
instead of taking cash. And those owning high-yielding income shares may
well wish to continue receiving the income stream, rather than invest in
lower-yielding securities elsewhere.
In any case, restructurings must be approved by 75 per cent of the
shareholders, indicating that it would be difficult to extend the life of a
trust in a way that was inimical to the financial well-being of investors.
Indeed, the restructuring of Yeoman Investment Trust failed in August when
it was clear that the proposals would not get the 75 per cent majority. A
major problem was that the income shareholders of the trust were not offered
a cash exit. Two substantial institutional income shareholders decided to
vote against the proposals.
One result of the failure of the Yeoman restructuring may be that future
deals will have to involve a cash exit for all shareholders. Only then can
deals be fair to those shareholders who were relying on the wind-up for
their financial plans.
But Yeoman's share register was dominated by institutions who knew which
levers to pull. Whether shareholder action will be as effective in the case
of some of the more recently floated split-capital trusts, whose registers
are dominated by private investors, is a moot point. But that is an issue
which will not arise until the mid-1990s.
TRUSTEE BUSINESS HELPS DIVIDEND YIELD
LAW DEBENTURE Corporation is one of the smaller international investment
trusts. But its investment performance shows that it should not be
neglected.
It was first in the international general sector over the three, five and
seven years to September 1, and second over the one- and two-year periods.
Over seven years, Pounds 1,000 invested in the trust (with dividends
reinvested) would have grown into Pounds 3,129.
Law Debenture was founded way back in 1889, as a company specialising in the
corporate debenture (in other words, asset-backed bond) market. It is now
managed by Michael Moule, of Touche Remnant, who also looks after Bankers
Investment Trust (third in the sector over seven years).
Although the fund's investment policy is relatively conventional, Law
Debenture has built up a substantial business as a trustee for loan
programmes and pension funds, which has given it a steady income stream.
When Law Debenture was appointed as trustee to the Maxwell pension fund
(after the tycoon's death), it received a sudden burst of publicity.
The importance of the trustee business, says Mr Moule, is that it has
allowed the trust to offer a relatively high dividend yield without
investing in the high-yielding stocks which have been so battered in the
recent recession.
Another factor behind the outperformance of the trust is that, while the
portfolio has been 65 per cent invested in the UK, the bulk of its overseas
holdings have been in the strong US market. The trust also had minimal
exposure to the battered Japanese market.
The success of the trust, however, has caused a problem for potential
investors. In mid-September, its shares were standing at a 10 per cent
premium to net asset value, according to County Nat West. Of course, that
move from discount to premium has helped existing investors (and improved
the performance figures). But new investors will be aware that it is not
normally considered sound investment strategy to buy trust shares at a
premium.
HOW CHARGES TAKE THE SHINE OFF PEPS
THE INCREASE to Pounds 6,000 in the annual personal equity plan limit for
most investment trusts has been good news for the sector. But investors
should still be aware of the danger that charges can easily outweigh the tax
advantages of a Pep.
For most people, the capital gains tax exemption is never going to be more
than a theoretical benefit. Only a small minority of investors can look
forward to annual inflation-adjusted gains of more than Pounds 5,800 (the
1992-93 limit).
It is, accordingly, the income tax exemption that is the key benefit of a
Pep. But the initial yield on an equity-based product will inevitably be
much lower than that available from a building society. The income tax
benefit of a Pep is thus lower than you might expect.
At the start of September, the average UK general investment trust yielded 6
per cent. So someone who invested the full Pounds 6,000 could look forward
to a gross annual income of Pounds 360, and a tax saving of Pounds 90 (for a
basic-rate payer) and Pounds 144 (for those on the higher rate).
Such savings are likely to repay charges very quickly. The problem comes if
a basic-rate taxpayer invests a smaller sum in a lower yielding trust.
Take the Martin Currie scheme, launched in September, which used a flat-fee
system of a Pounds 50 entry fee and a Pounds 60 annual charge. Higher-rate
taxpayers investing the full Pounds 6,000 in the high-yielding Securities
Trust of Scotland could earn back such charges in tax-savings within a year.
But a basic-rate taxpayer investing Pounds 2,000 in Martin Currie's European
Trust (yielding 0.4 per cent) would take around 50 years to earn back even
the first year's charges. He would be far better off investing in the trust
without the Pep 'benefit'.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (19): Keep an eye on
your deposit if you rent through an agency - Living in someone else's house
means wear and tear is a constant worry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE UK is overwhelmingly a property-owning society, with the private rental
sector accounting for only 7.4 per cent of the total housing stock.
But for a variety of reasons, many people are now becoming tenants.
Some foresee a prolonged period of low inflation and high real interest
rates, so that owning property may not be the good deal it was for much of
the 1980s. Others have sold their homes and are renting on a short-term
basis while looking for the right property to buy.
Once you have settled the economic arguments, the main drawback to renting
is that you are living in someone else's property. You are unlikely to be
able to redecorate the place to your taste, and if you have children (or
lots of parties) you will be constantly worried about wear and tear to the
property.
Until the 1988 Housing Act, it was arguably more desirable to be a tenant
than a landlord. But, as the accompanying article explains, the renting
sector shifted in favour of landlords once the Act had come into force on
January 15, 1989, doing away with protected tenancies for new tenants.
A landlord, instead of needing grounds for possession in order to evict a
tenant, can now evict them at two months' notice once the first six-month
period under the new assured shorthold tenancy is up.
Finding a property to rent
People usually find a flat or house through the classified columns, estate
agents or a letting agency.
The advantage of the last is convenience, though the drawback is that you
pay for the service. (If you find a property through an estate agent, the
person wishing to let it pays.)
The collapse of a number of letting agencies in the past few years has
highlighted the risk that tenants could lose their deposit. There are no
legal requirements, comparable to those required of solicitors or financial
advisers, for the holding of deposits in separate client accounts.
John Andrews was one of the lucky ones. He used the letting agency, Busy
Bees, to rent a flat in Finsbury Park, London, but was upset about the
amount of money extracted from him:
'They wanted one month's deposit, a six-week arrangement fee for finding the
place, and one month's rent in advance. I had to write out a cheque for near
on Pounds 1,000.'
Busy Bees went bust a year ago. Mr Andrews had already moved on and
recovered his deposit from the agency, but others lost the money they had
left with it.
Ensure that the letting or estate agent is a member of the Association of
Residential Letting Agents, or the National Association of Estate Agents.
The association gives guidelines to member firms, including the stipulation
that tenants' deposits be put in a separate account. You are entitled to
have this deposit returned to you with interest.
Do not pay a fee to a letting agency until it finds the place you are
renting - it is illegal for the agency to extract money from you before
then.
The tenancy agreement
If you rented on or after January 15, 1989, you will fall into one of three
categories of tenant:
1. Assured shorthold tenant. This is now the most common form of tenancy
arrangement. Your tenancy is for a fixed six-month period, during which you
cannot be evicted. At the end of the six months, the landlord can evict you
but has to give you two months notice.
2. Assured tenant: This gives you greater protection. You have a right to
stay for a fixed period of time unless the landlord has grounds for
possession - there are about 20 grounds. The rent can be assessed by the
landlord once a year.
3. Non-assured tenant: If you are neither of the above, you are likely to be
a non-assured tenant. People who have a resident landlord may not realise
that they fall into this category. Those who do not pay rent, or have a
company let, are also non-assured tenants.
You have few rights as a non-assured tenant, and could be given only four
weeks notice to leave, although your landlord would have to go to court to
evict you, according to Shelter.
Many people do not realise that a verbal agreement is just as legally
binding as a written agreement. 'In many cases it can be better,' said John
Goodwin, of Shelter, 'because a written agreement tends to have a lot of
exclusion clauses.' But take a friend who can act as a witness to back you
up if necessary.
If you sign a written agreement with your landlord, have it looked at by a
solicitor, the Citizen's Advice Bureau or a Housing/Law advice centre.
Moving in
You will be required to pay a deposit, usually equivalent to a month's rent.
You should certainly not agree to more than two months' rent unless your
tenancy is more than 21 months. Shelter's advice is that, when paying the
deposit, you get a written statement from the landlord, stating clearly how
much deposit has been paid and whether or not it is returnable. Also, get
the landlord to state what it could be used for, such as breakages or unpaid
rent.
If there is no inventory, take one yourself and get the landlord to sign it.
If you are presented with an inventory, carefully check all the items, and
if you notice defects on some items, tell the landlord - you do not want to
be told that the bath has to be replaced because you chipped it, when you
had noticed that it was chipped when you moved in.
Rents
The new Housing Act means that landlords can charge the market rent, rather
than a 'fair' rent as previously required. They can also review the rent
every year. Under the assured or assured shorthold tenancy, you are not
eligible to take an appeal for a fair rent to a Rent Office. If you think
you are being charged above market rent, you should contact the Rent
Assessment Committee or your local Citizen's Advice Bureau.
Problems
A common problem is a refusal by the landlord to pay for necessary
maintenance of the property. But since he is obliged to do structural
repairs and to ensure that the amenities are working, you can take him to
court.
The Small Claims Court will resolve disputes involving sums up to Pounds
1,000 for a small fee.
Another common problem is that the landlord withholds the deposit when you
move out, saying that it will be needed to clear up the mess you left
behind. A practical, but not strictly legal, way of anticipating this
problem is to withhold your final month's rent to offset against the
potential loss of the deposit.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (18): The law
protects you from bad tenants and low rents - As the slowdown in the housing
market brings letting and renting back into fashion, the Review offers
advice to families who are obliged to move
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF THE road to hell really is paved with good intentions, then there can be
no doubt that the devil is reserving a particularly hot spot for the men who
devised the Rent Act of 1977.
It was intended to protect tenants from unscrupulous landlords, by giving
them security of tenure and the right to apply for the registration of a
'fair rent'.
In fact, the Rent Act drove many landlords to withdraw their properties from
the market, causing a shortage of rentable properties and pushing up rents.
However, the recession is creating a revival in the private rental sector.
Many homeowners, unable to sell their properties, are looking to let their
houses in order to provide a source of income.
But how do you avoid getting stuck with an unwanted tenant at the end of the
term? And how do you avoid getting stuck with what you consider to be an
unrealistic rent?
Fortunately, the lawmakers created a solution to the problem in 1988 - the
'assured shorthold tenancy'. This is a fixed-term tenancy of not less than
six months. It is intended to be a balanced package, which offers the tenant
a reasonable, if limited, amount of security and the landlord the right to
recover possession if he so desires.
The tenant has two elements of security. First, the landlord cannot (save
for exceptional circumstances) end the tenancy for at least six months. Even
then, the tenant cannot be turned out of the property without notice.
In reality, however, the tenancy is weighted strongly in favour of the
landlord. If the agreement is drafted properly, he can insist that the
tenant leave after a minimum of six months.
Another bonus for the landlord is that there is very limited control over
the rents payable under an assured shorthold tenancy. It is possible for a
tenant to apply to a body called a 'rent assessment committee' for a ruling
that the rent is excessive.
However, the committee does not have to consider such an application, and is
not allowed to make a ruling unless certain strict criteria are satisfied.
What if the tenant proves to be your worst nightmare, smashing the furniture
and annoying the neighbours with endless parties?
Your letting agreement should include a right of 'forfeiture', entitling you
to terminate the agreement if the tenant misbehaves. But be warned: the
definition of 'misbehaviour' can be a complex legal issue, and a court order
is needed in such cases.
Setting up an assured shorthold tenancy is relatively simple. Prior to
creating the tenancy, the landlord must serve on the proposed tenant a
statutory notice in a prescribed form. If you have found your tenant through
a letting agency, then it should supply you with copies of this notice,
together with a standard letting agreement. If you are going it alone, then
both can be obtained from a legal stationery office, such as Oyez.
The notice specifies that the tenancy is to be an assured shorthold tenancy;
the letting agreement must provide for a fixed term of not less than six
months, and provide that the landlord cannot terminate the agreement before
then. This is absolutely essential if the legal conditions are to be met.
Save for these requirements, the parties are free to agree whatever terms
they like. However, if the landlord has any sense, he will include in the
agreement a right in his favour to terminate the tenancy at some time after
the six-month minimum.
Once you have created the tenancy, you then take one last but very important
step. You mark your diary not once but twice. One of the dates is when the
tenancy expires. The other entry should be several months in front of that
date and should read: 'Time to make a decision about the tenancy'.
When you reach the decision date, if everything has gone well, you may wish
to grant another shorthold tenancy to the same tenant. If so, you simply
agree the new rent and any new terms with the tenant, exchange new
agreements and effect your new tenancy. It is very important that the new
agreement is concluded prior to the end of the first term.
Provided that the premises are the same as those originally let, there is no
need to serve another assured shorthold tenancy notice. It is, however,
essential that the new tenancy is created on or before the date the original
fixed term expires.
But you may well want to regain possession of the premises, or replace the
tenant. Much will depend on the termination clause which you originally
inserted in the agreement. You might, for example, include a right to
terminate the agreement at any time after six months, by giving one month's
notice.
If the tenant argues for a longer agreement, then you could have a 12-month
term, with two months' notice of termination. The options are limitless.
Should you fail to include a termination clause, or want to obtain
possession after the end of the fixed term, the whole business becomes more
complicated. When the fixed term expires, a 'periodic statutory tenancy'
will arise. The periods of this statutory tenancy will be dictated by the
regularity of the rent payments under the fixed term. This will, of course,
mean that most statutory tenancies will be monthly tenancies.
The tenant will be entitled to remain in the premises on the same terms and
at the same rent as those of the fixed term. The periodic statutory tenancy
may only be terminated in accordance with the provisions of the 1988 Act.
However, this is not a total disaster. All that has to be done is to serve a
notice on the tenant informing him or her that you require possession of the
property. Not less than two months notice must be given. (This procedure
cannot be used to obtain possession before the end of the fixed term, and if
the tenancy has continued beyond that date, the notice must expire at the
end of one of the 'statutory periods'.)
In theory, a court order is needed to back up this notice. But do not fret:
the law is on your side. The court must make an order for possession in
favour of the landlord if he has followed the stipulated procedure (detailed
in the Housing Act 1988).
As a consequence, there is little point in the tenant's insisting that a
court order be obtained. If the tenant should prove blind to reason, then it
will be necessary to serve a further notice on the tenant and to apply for
the court order. This second, or 'section 8', notice must be in a prescribed
form and notify the tenant of the court
proceedings. The order can be obtained from the County Court, whose
procedures are relatively user-friendly.
However, before you rush off to create your first assured shorthold tenancy,
you should check whether the proposed tenancy will qualify. Not all
tenancies can qualify as an assured shorthold tenancy. The letting must be
to an individual or individuals, not a company. The tenant must occupy the
premises as his only or principal home, and it must comprise a separate
dwelling. Thus, a weekend bolt-hole will not qualify, nor will holiday
lettings.
Another exclusion concerns premises shared with a resident landlord. Whether
or not a landlord constitutes a 'resident landlord' is a complicated
subject. But a tenant in a typical flatshare situation, where the other
sharer owns the flat, can enjoy no security of tenure, and cannot be granted
an assured shorthold tenancy.
Finally, if the tenant already enjoys security of tenure, either via the
1988 Act or the old Rent Act of 1977, the tenancy cannot be converted to an
assured shorthold tenancy. Yes, horror of horrors, the Rent Act (as amended)
is still with us, and will continue to be so until all the tenancies created
before January 15, 1989, expire or are terminated. Throw another log on the
fire, Satan]

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (24):  Vehicles for
a subdued economy - Bond Funds, As charges fall, it could be worth paying
for management expertise / Survey of Unit Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOND UNIT trusts have played the role of fund management Cinderellas in the
UK. Unit trusts have traditionally been viewed as vehicles for equities, and
equities alone.
UK companies have, in any case, had a history of using equities, rather than
bonds, to raise finance. This leaves British investors without the culture
of investing in bonds which is common in other leading economies. In the UK,
investment in bonds traditionally means investment in gilt-edged stock
issued by the government.
Then comes the tax dimension. Invest in gilts directly, and you pay no
capital gains tax (CGT). Invest in them through a gilts unit trust, and you
do. So funds are an actively tax-inefficient way to invest.
Finally, there is the issue of cost. Buying gilts is easy - you can do it by
filling in a form at the post office. But managing a gilt portfolio requires
expertise and time. It may not be as tricky a job as keeping track of
thousands of listed equities, but resistance to paying front-end and
management charges is understandable.
All this may explain why only 2 per cent of unit trust funds in the UK are
in bonds, compared with more than 80 per cent in Germany and more than 30
per cent in the US. Another problem, according to investment manager
Guinness Flight, has been the high level of inflation in the UK, which harms
real bond yields more than it does the yields from cash and equities.
But now the climate of opinion is changing. With equity markets volatile,
many analysts still predict low inflation and low growth for the rest of
this decade. The belief among some commentators is that returns on equities
will not be much higher than those on bonds.
This view has been most closely associated with Norwich Union, which last
year cut the proportion of its life fund invested in equities from 70 per
cent to 60 per cent, and switched to bonds. NU predicted that the real
annual rate of return on equities would run at 8 per cent, compared with 6
per cent for bonds. During the 1980s the return on equities was 15 per cent.
Given the lower risk profile of bonds, and the possibility for more secure
financial planning, this makes the case for bond investment that much
stronger.
The fund management industry has gone some way to make bond funds more
attractive by cutting charges. In July, Fidelity slashed initial charges
from 5.25 per cent to 3.5 per cent, with an annual management charge of 1
per cent.
Fidelity's decision was based both on price competition and on the outlook
which it perceived for bonds. Also, Fidelity is keen to broaden the UK's
unit trust industry, believing that the concentration on equities, when
equity returns are in the doldrums, could have much to do with the problems
the industry is experiencing in selling products in general.
In August, Invesco MIM more than matched Fidelity by cutting initial charges
on its international bond fund from 5.25 per cent to 1.05 per cent, and
annual charges from 1 per cent to 0.5 per cent. Invesco had found that
portfolio managers were increasingly reluctant to pay a standard front-end
fee. Keith Crowley, of Invesco, stressed that the move did not mean the
company had lost confidence in equities. He said:
'If one is in the camp that believes the next major move in interest rates
in the world is going to be downwards, it makes sense to have part of your
portfolio in an international bond fund, which gives you a yield of more
than 7 per cent, and where there are reasonably good capital growth
prospects for the next 12 or 18 months.'
Then, in September, Abtrust launched two new funds, Aberdeen Gilt Growth and
Aberdeen Gilt Income, neither of which has any front-end charge at all. This
makes 'bed and breakfasting' - selling units and re-buying them the
following day to establish a fixed gain or loss for capital gains tax
purposes - very cost-effective, and removes gilt funds' tax problem. Annual
charges are 1 per cent.
Guinness Flight also altered the charges on the existing three bond funds -
which make up its monthly income plan - Premium Fixed Interest, Emu and
Global High Income. Annual management charges are 0.5 per cent for Premium
Fixed Interest, and 0.75 per cent for the other two.
Initial charges for large investments, were also cut - sums between Pounds
1,000 and Pounds 9,999 pay 3.5 per cent, with charges of 2.5 per cent from
Pounds 10,000 to Pounds 24,999, 1.5 per cent from Pounds 25,000 to Pounds
49,999, and 1.0 per cent for investments greater than this.
With charges as low as this, it could well be worth paying for fund
management expertise. The bulk volumes in which international bonds are
traded also make DIY portfolios impracticable.
Fund managers have also noticed some of the possibilities of portfolios
including bonds. For example, CGT is payable on international bond funds,
but at least investors are allowed the standard indexation allowance. This
allows for funds to be constructed with a high yield, plus a tax-efficient
loss after indexation which can be used to offset gains elsewhere in a
portfolio.
Mercury last year altered its gilt fund to hold international bonds, so that
this was possible; and a similar structure has been adopted by Guinness
Flight.
Albert E. Sharp has launched a trust that invests both in international
bonds and in convertibles (bonds convertible into equities) which allow a
broader spread of strategic options. When the time seems right, the holding
of convertibles can be increased to give exposure to equities without
sacrificing yield. Recently, the fund has been heavily invested in bonds.
Equities' poor performance, although in many ways a statistical fluke, also
makes bond funds look better. Over the five years to September 1 this year,
15 of the top 25 of all the 871 available unit trusts came from the gilts
and fixed interest sector.

FT  23 OCT 92 / International Company News: US airline results reflect fares
war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE parlous state of the US airline industry was underscored yesterday by
the third quarter losses posted by Delta Air Lines and USAir Group, and by
the decline in profitability at Northwest Airlines.
Mr John Dasburg, Northwest's chief executive, criticised American Airlines'
summer fare sale for damaging the entire industry. 'Their actions drove the
entire industry under water during what normally is a profitable quarter,'
he said.
Mr Thomas Roeck, Delta's chief financial officer, also blamed fare slashing
during the peak summer travel season for the disappointing quarter, although
he did not point to a single culprit.
Delta, one of the three US 'mega-carriers,' unveiled a net loss of Dollars
106.7m, or Dollars 2.64 a share, compared with net income of Dollars 13.1m,
or 17 cents, last year. The company had an operating loss of Dollars 162.5m
in the three months compared with operating income of Dollars 26.6m a year
ago.
USAir Group, the US airline in which British Airways wants to invest Dollars
750m for a big minority stake, narrowed its third-quarter net loss to
Dollars 55.4m, or Dollars 1.45 a share, from a deficit of Dollars 81.4m, or
Dollars 2.06.
The company also reduced its operating loss in the three months, to Dollars
35.7m from Dollars 45.4m. Revenues advanced to Dollars 1.7bn from Dollars
1.6bn.
Mr Seth Schofield, chairman and chief executive who had blamed domestic fare
wars for the group's weak second-quarter results, said there was evidence of
fares returning to "more compensatory levels'.
The quarterly loss at the air line subsidiary also narrowed, to Dollars
58.3m, on revenues of Dollars 1.6bn, from Dollars 74m, on revenues of
Dollars 1.5bn the previous year.
Its operating loss stood at Dollars 44.5m in the quarter against Dollars 53m
a year earlier.
The passenger load factor stood at 65.4 per cent, up from 60.7 per cent last
year. For the first nine months, the group suffered a net loss of Dollars
203.3m, or Dollars 5.16, against one of Dollars 306.9m, or Dollars 7.40.
There were fewer shares outstanding in the 1991 period. Revenues rose to
Dollars 5.1bn from Dollars 4.8bn.
The airline unit had a net deficit of Dollars 191.1m in the first nine
months of 1992 on revenues of Dollars 4.7bn. This compares with a deficit of
Dollars 284m on revenues of Dollars 4.5bn last year.
Northwest Airlines, the fourth largest US carrier which was privatised in a
Dollars 3.65bn leveraged buy-out in 1989, saw third-quarter earnings decline
to Dollars 46.5m from Dollars 105.1m a year ago.
Revenues rose 3.4 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 2.22bn, while expenses
grew 8.3 per cent to Dollars 2.15bn.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK still out to lure Euro-bank: London's undimmed ambition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE British government is maintaining its battle to bring the mooted
European central bank to London, in spite of sterling's exit last month from
the European exchange rate mechanism.
A plan to establish the European Monetary Institute (EMI) as the forerunner
to a European central bank will be high on the agenda today when EC treasury
and central bank officials meet in Berlin.
However, it was not clear last night whether the officials, gathering for an
informal session of the European monetary committee, will discuss the site
of the EMI. Under the Maastricht treaty, European governments intended to
decide the venue of the EMI by the end of this year, ready for it to come
into operation in 1994 in the second stage of economic and monetary union
(Emu).
This timetable has since been thrown into doubt by the uncertainties over
the fate of the treaty.
A spokesman for the British Treasury said last night that the UK was
sticking to its view that London would be the best possible site for the
operation of the EMI and, later, for the central bank itself. 'This remains
our view. . . We shall put it forward in all the appropriate fora,' the
spokesman said.
Britain will continue to play a part in discussions on Emu, despite its
forced departure from the ERM on September 16. But maintenance of the
Treasury's line backing London as the site for the EMI may attract growing
opposition, and possibly ridicule, from other EC countries.
Spain is expected to use today's meeting to make an active call for the EMI
to go into operation on time. It also wants the mooted institute to play a
stronger role in co-ordinating intervention in support of weaker currencies
in the ERM - a key part of overall Spanish arguments for reforms of the
exchange mechanism.
Mr Carlos Solchaga, the Spanish finance minister, proposed earlier this
month that ERM central banks pool their foreign exchange reserves to marshal
greater ammunition against currency speculators.
Other countries such as France have proposed in the past that the EMI manage
these reserves. This idea is, however, opposed by Germany and the
Netherlands, which want reserves to remain fundamentally under national
control.
Spain also wants agreement on intramarginal intervention - a pact between
ERM members that forces central banks to begin intervening before currencies
reach their ceilings or floors.

after 8 months

<TEXT>
REPOLA, the Finnish forestry and engineering group, made a FM415m (Dollars
87m) loss for the first eight months of the year, compared with a FM607m
deficit in the same period of 1991.
It achieved a 7 per cent increase in consolidated net sales to FM14.95bn
from FM13.92bn, and an operating profit of FM818m, nearly double the 1991
figure of FM426m.
Repola said that it would make a financial loss for the whole of 1992
because of the weakening of the Finnish markka since it was floated on
September 8. On the day of the float, the company's net liabilities in
foreign currencies totalled FM5.5bn. Repola said the increase in its export
revenues would cover exchange losses in less than a year.
The company forecast a further improvement in its operating profit during
the last four months of 1992.
It added that shutdowns during the summer had brought a further loss to
Repola. But the present results were 'a clear improvement' on the same
period of 1991, despite an oversupply of printing papers which had kept
capacity utilisation rates low, reduced newsprint prices, a slack demand for
investment and the higher cost of financing.
In its forestry activities the company made a profit after financial items
of FM121m for the first eight months, compared with a FM323m loss for the
same period last year. Net sales rose by 2 per cent to FM 8.92bn from FM
8.73bn.

MINNESOTA Mining and Manufacturing Company, the adhesives and coatings
conglomerate, yesterday unveiled a 14 per cent increase in earnings. Net
income jumped to Dollars 338m or Dollars 1.54 per share in the
third-quarter, from Dollars 296m or Dollars 1.35 last year.
The results were slightly better than analysts had expected. Mr LD DeSimone,
chairman, said earnings benefited from a good performance in US
manufacturing operations, a weaker dollar and a lower tax rate.
Of the 19-cent share increase in quarterly earnings, the company said about
7 cents came from operations, about 7 cents from positive currency
translations, and about 4 cents from a lower corporate tax rate.
For the first nine months earnings rose to Dollars 948m, or Dollars 4.33,
from last year's Dollars 898m or Dollars 4.08 per share.
Sales advanced 6.6 per cent to Dollars 3.6bn in the quarter, from Dollars
3.38bn last year and for the first nine months they were up 3.9 per cent to
Dollars 10.51bn, from Dollars 10.12bn last time.

DE BEERS of South Africa yesterday welcomed a new arrangement between Russia
and Yakutia, the region which produces 99 per cent of Russian rough
diamonds, claiming it would end uncertainty over who controlled the Russian
diamond business.
Mr Gary Ralfe, head of De Beers' London-based Central Selling Organisation,
which dominates the world diamond trade, also said he believed that there
would be no Russian attempt to renegotiate an agreement giving De Beers a
virtual monopoly of sales of Russia's uncut diamonds before the deal expired
in 1995. That was at odds with earlier threats by Mr Leonid Gurevich,
parliament's co-chairman on a state commission examining the diamond
industry, who last night invited Mr Ralfe to his office for talks that may
produce more bad news for De Beers' quest for certainty.
Mr Ralfe said none the less he expected parliament today to endorse
Almazrossii-Sakha, the newly-created joint stock company giving 40 per cent
control to Yakutia and 32.5 per cent of the shares to the Russian
government. The remaining shares are to be held by unspecified statutory
bodies, he said.
'What I'm happy about is that there should be clarity or relative clarity
where before there was uncertainty,' he said during a visit to Moscow
coinciding with parliament's vote on the project. 'We want to be dealing
with a single authority which speaks for the whole of the Russian diamond
business.'
The new company is to be headed by Mr Valery Rudakov, who resigned this
summer as chairman of the state conglomerate grouping both gold and diamonds
with a bitter complaint that centralised control was disappearing.
Mr Ralfe added he had received assurances from Yakutia that it would not
team up with a Japanese company to set up a diamond-cutting plant and
suggested that if the project did go ahead, it would be with De Beers.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: 'Acceptable' buyer sought for Cherry
Blossom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade, has accepted
undertakings from Sara Lee Corporation and Sara Lee Household &amp; Personal
Care that it will sell the Cherry Blossom shoe polish brand to an
'acceptable' buyer within 12 months, writes Peter Pearse.
Sara Lee already owned the Kiwi brand and acquired Cherry Blossom and other
brands from Reckitt &amp; Colman in October 1991. The MMC concluded that owning
both the dominant brands would create adverse effects on competition.
The MMC was particularly concerned with the 'self-selection' market saying
that the Cherry Blossom acquisition had lifted Sara Lee's share of that
market segment from 44 to 74 per cent.
This could provide the group with scope to increase prices substantially
before putting its high market share at risk, it suggested.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Kwik Save buys 12 Grandways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KWIK SAVE, the UK's biggest discount chain, has bought 12 Grandways
supermarkets from privately owned William Jackson for Pounds 13.6m.
The deal comes only a week after Argyll, the supermarket group, paid William
Jackson Pounds 23m for nine stores. The sale to Kwik Save marks William
Jackson's exit from the increasingly competitive supermarket sector. The
family-run company intends to focus on the convenience store market.
Kwik Save said yesterday that the stores, based in Yorkshire and Humberside,
were 'an excellent strategic fit'.
Mr Keith Lovell, finance director, said the difference in price paid by
Argyll and Kwik Save could have been down to 'basic economics . . . A
discounter like us could not afford to pay as much as the majors.'
Kwik Save will fund the purchase through bank borrowings. Mr Lovell said
gearing would remain 'negligible' even after the acquisition.
Earlier this year, Kwik Save had targeted a debt to equity ratio of less
than 10 per cent by the year-end. The acquisition would not be dilutive, he
added.
The 12 stores, which will be handed over on a phased basis, would add
approximately Pounds 45m to sales on an annual basis. They are mostly larger
than the average Kwik Save target of 8,000 sq ft.
Mr Lovell said the company would trade out of 12,000 sq ft in the bigger
stores, and convert the remaining space for rental to concessions.

FT  23 OCT 92 / Search for security: Last-ditch efforts to reach an
agreement on capital adequacy in the securities markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The lurches in financial markets in recent weeks should give pause for
thought to anyone who has deposited money in a bank.
True, most banks have made a small killing trading in the foreign exchange
markets, at the expense of central banks (and taxpayers) across Europe. But
how well protected are they against the shocks that can buffet currency or
equity markets?
Not well enough, according to many banking and securities regulators. It is
timely, therefore, that this weekend will witness the latest attempt to
forge an international agreement on the minimum levels of capital needed by
all banks, as well as securities houses, which operate in securities
markets.
At its annual meeting in London, Iosco - the International Organisation of
Securities Commissions, a grouping of securities regulators from more than
50 countries - will try to reach agreement on a capital adequacy regime
which has already been under discussion for more than three years.
Banking regulators, under the umbrella of their own international club, the
Basle committee on banking supervision, have virtually concluded their own
deliberations in parallel talks. But given the way the issue has been
stalled for much of this year, a final resolution may still be some way off.
The planned international agreement is not the first of its type. Banks'
credit risks will be subjected to common capital adequacy rules from the
start of next year, when the so-called 'Basle accord' comes into force. This
requires banks to hold capital equal to 8 per cent of their assets.
That, however, only catches part of each bank's exposures, Apart from the
risk of loans going bad, banks also face possible losses from movements in
interest rates, currencies and equity markets - the sort of market movements
that can wipe out the value of a securities portfolio or leave foreign
exchange traders nursing big losses.
Also, underwriting or trading in shares creates risks which are very
different to those on loans. This is because the value of equities rises and
falls on expectations of a company's future profits, movements which usually
have no bearing on whether a company is going to repay a loan when it falls
due.
These risks have risen sharply as banks have moved more aggressively into
the securities business - in part, ironically, prompted by the higher
capital costs imposed by the Basle accord on traditional banking business.
Many bank regulators already have their own rules governing these exposures,
but there is no internationally agreed approach to such capital
requirements.
One man has been largely responsible for holding up agreement this year. Mr
Richard Breeden, chairman of the US's Securities and Exchange Commission, is
also chairman of Iosco's important technical committee. According to several
people who have been involved in the discussions, it is his concerns which
account for the delay.
Mr Breeden's objection concerns the amount of capital that securities
companies must set aside to cover their risks on equities. At the start of
this year, banking and securities regulators - Mr Breeden among them -
agreed broadly on a 2 per cent requirement to cover the 'specific' risk in
shares (as distinct from the general risk of markets as a whole falling).
Since then, though, the SEC has vacillated, pushing earlier this summer for
a 4 per cent minimum capital level.
Securities companies claim such levels are unnecessary, given the
sophistication of modern hedging techniques that limit the risks of holding
securities. They would make the cost of doing business in the securities
markets more expensive.
Any compromise that left the US with a 4 per cent rule and the rest of the
world with 2 per cent would damage the US's position as a centre for
international securities business, and could even drive trading in US
securities off-shore.
If Iosco can't reach agreement, then it may have wrecked its chances of
becoming a credible international regulatory body for good. The Basle
committee has made it clear that it will release its own proposals for
consultation soon, with or without the agreement of Iosco.
The organisation, created in the 1970s by the SEC to act initially as a
pan-American agency, has never achieved the same international credibility
as the Basle committee. Securities regulators in Anglo-Saxon countries such
as the US and UK spend much of their time looking nervously over their
shoulders at their banking counterparts, concerned that the gradual
domination of the securities industry by banks will make their job
redundant.
Taking the lead in the development of international capital adequacy rules
has been Iosco's main chance of establishing itself on the financial map. If
it fails to grasp this opportunity, then its hopes of acting as a leading
force in the development of financial regulation around the world will come
to nothing.

FT  23 OCT 92 / UK Company News: ACT buys ailing NMW in Pounds 3.8m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WORSENING in the finances of NMW Computers has forced the company to
accept a bid from ACT, the Birmingham- based computing services group, at
18p a share - 56 per cent less than yesterday's opening price.
The cash offer from ACT, formerly known as Apricot, values NMW, which
specialises in services and software for the UK securities business, at
Pounds 3.8m. NMW shares fell by 23p to 18p. ACT's shares rose 4p to 147p.
In June ACT spent Pounds 2.1m to take a 25.4 per cent stake in NMW at 40p a
share. It had to get special dispensation from the Takeover Panel to bid for
the company at less than the price at which it bought its stake.
A sudden deterioration in its finances led to NMW, which could no longer
count on its banks for support, to recommend ACT's discounted offer price.
However, speculation that ACT was planning a full bid for NMW had already
pushed up the company's share price.
There is a share alternative of one new ACT share for every eight NMW
shares.
Higher than anticipated costs incurred in developing NMW Charterhouse, the
software business specialising in debt recovery and the Lloyd's insurance
market, was mainly responsible for a pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.23m for the
half year to June 30.
This compared with a profit of Pounds 278,000. Losses per share of 5.7p
compared with earnings of 0.9p. Sales slipped to Pounds 4.9m (Pounds 4.98m).
While NMW would not talk about the deal yesterday it is understood that
trading performance has been so poor that, without considering the problems
at Charterhouse, restructuring would have been necessary.
The depth of the problems at Charterhouse did not come to light until
management changes during the summer and it was considered better to give
the shareholders all the bad news at once rather than allow it to dribble
out.
ACT said it would reorganise Charterhouse to stem the division's losses of
Pounds 1.2m.
Stockbroking operations at both companies will be integrated.

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (17): Anxiety over
Europe - The Professionals / The four believe that Germany is heading for
recession, and that this spells wider danger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you can keep your head when all about you
Are losing theirs . . .
THE PAST tumultuous month has been a time to recall Rudyard Kipling's famous
test of manliness.
Indeed, it must have been close to the mind of Newton's Howard Beaufort,
when he said in his latest market commentary: 'A refusal to panic, combined
with a reasoned and continual re-appraisal of the changing investment
circumstances, are the maxims for weathering the present storms.'
Perhaps the most most sanguine will have been Baillie Gifford's Douglas
McDougall: with 60 per cent of his portfolio outside the UK, he has reaped
significant windfall gains, at least in sterling terms, as the pound has
tumbled on the world's foreign exchanges. His 15 per cent French bond
holding will also have provided a much needed point of strength.
Howard Beaufort has also been swift to emphasise that more than half of his
UK equity holding - which now amounts to 48 per cent of the portfolio - is
in exporters, or significant overseas earners.
Needless to say, the problems of the government in restoring confidence in
its economic management skills have played a large part in the turbulence of
the UK equity market over the past month. Our professionals do not expect
Britain's exit from the European Monetary System to lead to any substantial
cuts in interest rates, or a quick sprint for inflation-inducing growth -
which means they continue to favour 'high quality growth stocks' rather than
cyclicals. But some remain more skittish than others.
There is consensus that Germany is heading towards recession, in part
because of what Gartmore's Paul Myners calls Bonn's 'monetary overkill'.
They agree with Howard Beaufort that this spells wider European dangers:
'ERM or no ERM, a recessionary and increasingly uncompetitive Germany spells
danger for European economic growth.'
With currencies in the 'Deutsche Mark block' now so strong against sterling,
the temptation to liquidate European holdings is considerable  -
particularly in view of the consensus that the dollar is set to strengthen
further after a little local difficulty around the US presidential election.
The four agree that bonds continue to provide a safe haven, and that the
Pacific region has a monopoly on economic buoyancy for the medium term.
Beyond that, their strategies remain as contrasted as ever:
Douglas McDougall (Baillie Gifford) plans to cut his European equity
holdings from 25 per cent to 20 per cent, transferring these funds to
south-east Asia, which now also accounts for 20 per cent of the portfolio.
Instead of boosting his bond holdings, he has halved his French bond stake
to 7 1/2 per cent, and used the proceeds to buy US bonds.
He is keeping aloof from the US equity market, where he sees the public,
corporate and personal debt overhang as a brake on the economy. He sees
Japan retaining its basic economic strength, but says equities are too
expensive after the market's recent recovery. He plans to add to his 5 per
cent holding 'at lower levels'.
Paul Myners (Gartmore) agrees with Douglas McDougall about the US markets,
but has divergent views on Japan, using the recent rally in Tokyo to get out
of the market. 'It is clear what a mess Japan's economy is in,' he says.
He has moved with the strongest conviction in Europe, where he foresees
looming recession and currency turbulence. He has sold his entire 15 per
cent equity holding, adding instead to his bond holdings - 10 per cent in
Europe and 5 per cent in the US. He has also raised his equity holdings in
Asia (ex-Japan) by 5 per cent to 17 1/2 per cent, being convinced that
strong market performances will be enhanced by currency gains.
Howard Beaufort (Newton Investment Management) mixes strong views with
rather more gentle action. He is selling a 4 per cent holding in Spain on
uncertainty over its currency, and is mixing the proceeds with some of his
cash to buy a 6 per cent holding in a Dutch bond.
Rather than shifting out of UK equities, he favours exporters and
overseas-earning counters. He nevertheless acknowledges that 'devaluation
and a floating currency puts very high risk premiums back into the price of
UK financial assets'.
In response to deepening gloom over Europe's economic prospects, he is
concentrating on 'established growth areas' like food-manufacturing and
pharmaceuticals, and on dollar or D-Mark earners in the 'virtuous core' of
Switzerland, Holland and France. Tim Howe (Singer &amp; Friedlander) looks to an
early end to volatility in the UK, but is trimming his equity holdings by 2
per cent to 58 per cent, and remaining a holder of 'quality
internationally-based equities'. He is also resisting any shift to cyclical
stocks.
He expects the D-Mark to weaken in 1993 'as the reality of (German)
stagflation becomes apparent', and expects currency volatility in Spain. So
he is capturing some currency gains by trimming European holdings by 3 per
cent to 7 per cent. He has used this stake to buy US equities, where he
feels the chance to take advantage of a strengthening dollar outweighs the
danger of a 'triple dip' in the US economy.
In contrast to Paul Myners, he is adding to his equity holdings in Japan,
while taking profits in Hong Kong and selling his Latin American holdings.
The net effect of this is to trim his stake in the Pacific region from 8 per
cent to 6 per cent.
He remains a 'happy holder' of D-Mark bonds, but plans to reduce this
holding as German interest rates fall. Meanwhile, he has locked into a 5 per
cent holding in UK gilts 'to protect the portfolio from falling UK base
rates and to lock in a gross redemption yield just over 9 per cent.'

FT  23 OCT 92 / FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance (29): Sexual
equality is not as simple as it sounds - Pensions / With a common state
pensionable age of 65 seeming likely, how can one best prepare for it?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC SHORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN WILL have to wait longer before they can receive a state pension, if
the government accepts recent proposals.
The Social Security Advisory Committee dropped a bombshell when, in evidence
to the government's inquiry into the equalisation of state pension ages, it
re-commended that women receive the state pension at age 65, the present age
for men, instead of at 60.
The committee admitted that its reasons were financial - the estimated
Pounds 3bn saved each year by making women wait for their pension could be
spent on raising the social security benefits paid to the poorer sections of
the community.
It is a solution which accepts that the resources available for social
security are finite. One lesson from the last general election was that,
while people supported the proposals for higher benefits, they were not
prepared to pay for them through higher taxes or higher National Insurance
contributions.
But pensions and retirement are not related solely to financial
considerations. Employment policy and social trends also have an impact on
attitudes.
Over the past decade, men have been ceasing work well before state pension
age. The 1991 labour-force survey, published in the Employment Gazette of
April 1992, showed that more men are stopping working before age 65, even
though they do not receive a retirement pension from the state until they
reach age 65.
There are two main reasons for this. Employers, when reducing their
workforce, have tended to make older employees redundant; while many
employees want to cease working before age 65, either because they have had
enough of work or because they want to do something different while they are
still young enough.
The present employment pattern is different among women. The number working
beyond age 60 is comparatively small, but it is growing. The Department of
Employment does not expect these numbers to increase significantly, but its
predictions are based on the present pension ages.
Taken together, the figures show that only two out of three people are
working beyond age 55, so that one may safely assume that large numbers of
men and women will cease work well before reaching 65.
Although Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, has given no
indication of the government's likely action, it is expected that it will
raise the women's pension age to 65, with a suitable run-in period, despite
the trend towards earlier retirement. If this does happen, what can
employees, both men and women, do to ensure that they have an income if they
cease work before age 65?
There are two courses. The first and more practical is to look to the
private sector, either through an occupational pension scheme or by making
arrangements for a personal pension.
Many occupations, such as banking, insurance and the Civil Service, have
traditionally retired their employees at 60. Several other schemes now have
a common pension age below 65 for both sexes.
Where such schemes integrate their benefits with the state basic pension, it
is common for them to pay men an additional bridging pension from retirement
until age 65, to replace the single person's state pension. So if the
government does equalise at age 65, occupational schemes with integrated
benefits will be under pressure to pay bridging pensions to both men and
women until age 65.
However, the latest survey from the National Association of Pension Funds
shows that more occupational schemes are setting their common pension age at
65. These could come under pressure from employees to provide generous
early-retirement benefits, together with bridging pensions.
Employees in occupational schemes would need to consider making further
savings provision themselves, such as additional voluntary contributions
(AVCs) and personal equity plans (Peps).
A move to equalise pension ages at 65 would send a signal to employees who
are not in occupational schemes that they cannot rely on the state for their
pension if they stop working early. They would need to make their own
provision through personal pensions, which allow individuals to take
benefits from age 50.
However, employees will need to make substantial contributions in order to
secure worthwhile early-retirement pensions, because there will be less time
to build up a substantial fund, and annuity rates are lower at an early age.
The second approach, favoured by many in the pensions industry, is to press
for a system of flexible retirement - that is, employees would be able to
retire at a convenient time over a period, such as between ages 60 and 70.
This looks attractive on paper, but there are a number of flaws, such as who
would decide when the time is convenient - the employee or the employer?
So long as entitlement to the state pension depends only on employees
reaching a certain age, not on whether they have ceased work, most will take
the pension at the earliest possible age, even though they may still be
working.
Employees can currently defer taking the state pension for up to five years,
receiving an enhancement when it is eventually taken. Few take up this
option, even when they continue working. And this would be likely to happen
with a flexible pension age, thereby negating any flexibility, unless
entitlement to the pension also required employees to cease paid employment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So he was after all - awarded the military cross. Peter Phillips, joint
liquidator for the personal estate of Robert Maxwell, divulges that he has
himself set eyes on the thing - thereby silencing those unkind souls who had
been inclined to doubt the late tycoon's claims regarding the official
recognition accorded his war efforts.
Along with other possessions from the Oxford home, Headington Hill Hall  -
such as a single bottle of Chateau Mouton Rothschild 1945 - the cross will
be sold by Sotheby's at public auctions in November and December. A portion
of the proceeds from the sale will go to Maxwell's widow, Elizabeth. 'But if
she wants the cross she'll have to bid for it', Phillips explains.

<TEXT>
SYNTEX, the US pharma-ceuticals group, said yesterday it was implementing a
cost-cutting programme that would involve restructuring some of its
administrative and marketing organisations and eliminate a number of
positions.
The cuts, almost unprecedented in the drugs industry, follow the statement
by Eli Lilly, another US group, that it was taking a charge of Dollars 519m
to close manufacturing facilities.
Syntex said it would reshuffle some of its research and development
activities to focus on the most promising programmes. The company said the
move followed disappointing results during the first two months of its
fiscal 1993 first quarter.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Arts: James Saunders play re-opens Criterion - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the loveliest theatres in London, the Criterion in Piccadilly Circus,
has re-opened after a four year pause for refurbishment. It looks
resplendent from inside and out. You can still hear the sound of the
underground beneath, though perhaps the trains run a little less frequently
than they used to.
In one way the place might never have closed. It has come back with Making
It Better by James Saunders whose Next Time I'll Sing to You and A Scent of
Flowers made him seem a promising playwright in the early 1960s.
It is not that Saunders has gone backwards, merely that he has failed to
develop. Here we are with a rather slight, well enough written play that is
not going to offend anyone; nor excite them either.
For the culturally aware, there are two references to Graham Greene within
the first few minutes. There are also the comforting background and voices
of the BBC World Service.
Jane Asher playing Diana Harrington must be one of the few actresses who can
claim to sleep with the entire cast. Not that she is a nymphomaniac; there
are only three, apart from herself.
In order of appearance they go as follows: her husband, who has decided to
'come out' and therefore leaves her; an old Czech, who has defected in the
pregnant year of 1968 and whom she picks up in a pub; and a young Czech who
has first been the male lover of her husband.
On stage it all looks quite innocent. The setting is London, the time 1989 -
the year of the real Prague spring. (Saunders has previously worked on
Redevelopment, one of the plays by the Czech President, Vaclav Havel). There
is still a little spying going on, but not nearly enough to make a plot.
The Czech connection is simply that both Diana and her husband have
previously worked for the BBC in Prague. Now they are back in Bush House,
the headquarters of the BBC's overseas broadcasting, where it seems that
Czechs are two a penny.
Here there are a few jokes. One had forgotten what asinine programmes the
World Service puts out between news bulletins: snatches of Buddy Holly and
helpful documentaries on the spread of science and technology.
'Well, of course,' says the announcer, 'the history of telecommunications is
still developing. Next Wednesday we shall be talking to the man who tried to
put a telephone in every village in India.' Possibly this is Saunders being
satirical; it struck me as the funniest line in the play.
Making It Better is not a bad piece, just a bit slow. Ms Asher is a very
professional actress who would be better still if she had sharper lines.
Larry Lamb as her sometimes husband looks exactly like the sort of man you
would expect to meet in the World Service of the BBC.
David de Keyser and Rufus Sewell play the old and young Czechs respectively.
It is mildly surprising to find that the director is Michael Rudman;
normally he goes for something more ambitious. He had already directed
Making It Better at the Hampstead Theatre earlier this year, so perhaps he
sees hidden depths.
The best news remains that the Criterion is back on the map.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Survey of Leman Region (4): Deep roots in Lausanne / Profile
of Bobst
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOBST, the world leader in cardboard packaging machinery, started life just
over 100 years ago as a humble print supplies shop in Lausanne. Although it
now employs 5,400 people worldwide, production continues to be centred in
Lausanne, almost all of it for export.
Like many Swiss companies, the original family remains intimately involved
in the company's affairs. Descendants of the founder, Joseph Bobst, and his
son, Henri, retain a majority shareholding with two other families. Mr Bruno
de Kalbermatten, company president, is Henri Bobst's son-in-law. Of the nine
executive directors, four are family members.
It was Henri Bobst who, in 1940, invented the first automated die-cutting
press for making cardboard boxes. The company now makes machinery for
manufacturing and printing cardboard and paper packaging of every shape and
size, from the famous triangular Toblerone boxes and cigarette packets to
corrugated casings for safe delivery of domestic appliances.
Last year, Bobst had a worldwide turnover of SFr1.13bn, while consolidated
net earnings were up 18 per cent to SFr71m despite the global recession.
Although growth has slowed this year, the company is still predicting
satisfactory results for 1992 - in sharp contrast to the difficulties now
being experienced by many other Swiss machinery manufacturers.
Two-thirds of Bobst's sales go to Europe, with North America accounting for
10-20 per cent. Bobst has dominated the market in these countries for
high-performance, extremely reliable machines, and some 8-9 per cent of
turnover is spent on research and development.
However, the group is also expanding its medium-price product range of
simpler machines. This is partly to tap growing markets in the developing
world - a quarter of worldwide sales last year - and partly to serve
increasing demand in the industrialised countries from recession-hit or
smaller companies seeking a cheaper alternative. Nearly half Bobst's total
sales last year were of medium-priced machines.
Bobst's global network is chiefly focused on sales and after-sales service.
Although the group has machining and assembly plants in the US, Brazil and
Japan, these are intended chiefly to maintain a notional manufacturing
presence in these markets. In Europe, Bobst has affiliates in France,
Germany, Denmark and Italy, bought as going manufacturing concerns with
their own distinct product ranges. Some 60 per cent of the group's total
production by value is still based in Lausanne.
Family links as well as tradition clearly give the company deep roots in
Lausanne and, more generally, in the Canton of Vaud. However, Mr Andreas
Koopmann, Bobst's production director - with no family connections - says
there are also economic advantages.
Chief among these is a highly skilled workforce. 'Even the simplest of our
packaging machines has 21,000 parts', says Mr Koopmann. 'Our production
requires a lot of technical know-how.' He says the Swiss apprenticeship and
technical schools system 'gives us the people we need'.
Mr Koopmann also cites Lausanne's central position in Europe, where most of
Bobst's production goes, good communications and Switzerland's tradition of
labour peace. Taxes are relatively low, the economy prosperous despite a
nasty recession, and the quality of life is high.
There are also disadvantages. Costs are high, not only for labour but for
land, buildings and energy. Bobst faces a constant battle to curb costs,
making full use of techniques such as 'just-in-time' stock control, and has
recently introduced 'work islands' or autonomous teams that have enabled it
to reduce support staff and boost productivity.
Another problem has been recruitment of qualified workers in tight labour
market conditions, although current high unemployment means this is not the
constraint it was.
Perhaps most importantly, the political and planning environment is not very
encouraging for industry wanting to establish or expand. Bobst's French
affiliate, S. A. Martin, recently built a new factory in the Lyon area. From
purchase of the land to completion of the building took 18 months, including
obtaining planning permission for re-zoning. A comparable exercise in Vaud
could take four to eight years, says Mr Koopmann.
Bobst has no intention of uprooting from Lausanne, or shifting more
production abroad. But like most successful Swiss exporters, the company is
a staunch supporter of closer European integration through the European
Economic Area (EEA) and eventual Swiss membership of the European Community.

THE STATE-OWNED Trinidad and Tobago Oil Company has received a USDollars 18m
loan from the Caribbean Development Bank to help finance a programme for
on-shore and off-shore secondary oil recovery and to improve the volume of
refinery throughput.
The bank, based in Barbados, said the Trinidadian project would cost Dollars
411m, and that financing was also being obtained from the Inter-American
Development Bank, the Japan Import-Export Bank, the Commonwealth Development
Corporation, the European Investment Bank and the oil company.
The programme will double the capacity of the company's refinery at
Pointe-a-Pierre in Southern Trinidad, the bank said, and the increased
demand for crude will be met by improving the secondary oil recovery
on-shore and off-shore.
It is anticipated that the programme will yield the secondary recovery of
just over 13m barrels of heavy crude from onshore fields in the first phase.
This will be followed by the secondary recovery of 17m barrels of lighter
crude from offshore fields. Refinery throughput, which has been about
100,000 barrels a day, will be increased when capacity is expanded to
160,000 b/d.

<TEXT>
HUTCHISON Whampoa is attempting to find a new partner for its UK
telecommunications subsidiary as British Aerospace has indicated a desire to
sell its 35 per cent stake in the company.
But Mr Simon Murray, Hutchison managing director, was adamant yesterday his
company's stake would not be sold.
He said Hutchison would withdraw from an aggressive push for new cellular
telephone licences beyond its core markets, reflecting concerns over its
expansion into telecommunications. But Mr Murray said the company was
proceeding with its multi-billion dollar expenditure into the UK.
Hutchison, Hong Kong's most rumour-plagued company, was hit by another wave
of market speculation yesterday over reports that it is to dispose of all
its non-Hong Kong telecommunications operations.
Mr Murray said that some smaller loss-making operations had been shut, but
there was to be no large-scale retrenchment. The company's HKDollars 7bn
(Dollars 903m)personal communications network would be completed by early
1994 and he was optimistic it would be profitable by 1996.
'Hutchison Telecommunications is doing very well overall. It will make more
this year than it did last year,' said Mr Murray, who was confident that the
freeze on new projects would ensure this side of business remained on track.
The continued under-performance of its shares suggests investors remain
unconvinced.

MARSH &amp; McLennan, the world's largest insurance broker, yesterday reported a
small decline in third-quarter profits, to Dollars 69.7m after-tax.
This compares with Dollars 74m in the same period a year ago, and translates
into earnings per share of 97 cents, down from Dollars 1.02.
Marsh, based in New York, also takes in the Putman Group investment services
business and the Mercer employment benefits operation.
Third-quarter operating profits amounted to Dollars 125.1m, against Dollars
133.4m in the same period of 1991. Revenues totalled Dollars 730m, up from
Dollars 679m.
The latest figures brought after-tax profits to Dollars 251.7m for the first
nine months of the year, little different from the Dollars 251.3m recorded
at this stage last year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMR, the parent company of American Airlines and one of the three largest US
carriers, yesterday revealed a third-quarter after-tax loss of Dollars 85m -
the worst result it has recorded for a July-September period.
The summer months are when airlines traditionally make much of their money.
Even in 1991, a bad year for the industry, AMR posted net third-quarter
profits of Dollars 70m.
Mr Robert Crandall, the company's chairman, yesterday called the results
'very unsatisfactory'. He blamed the domestic fare wars which generated
extremely cheap tickets for summer travel earlier this year. 'Our
third-quarter revenue problem was caused primarily by very low domestic
yields,' he said, pointing out that yield fell from 12.52 cents a year
earlier to 10.66 cents in the third quarter of 1992.
'The impact of this on American was compounded by the fact that American's
domestic system is the largest in the industry and represents a large
percentage of our total revenues.'
Hurricane Andrew, which caused damage in southern Florida and Louisiana in
late August, also had an adverse effect, he said, as did 'the fact that the
company, because of previously-scheduled aircraft deliveries, grew more
rapidly during the third quarter than most other airlines."
However, American, which is seen a bellwether for the troubled US airline
industry and traditionally kicks of the carriers' reporting season, had
already warned it would be in the red during the three months, and more
optimistic comments about prospects ahead helped its shares to gain Dollars
1 1/8 yesterday at Dollars 62 1/8 .
Mr Michael Durham, finance director, said the recent firming of fare levels
made the outlook 'somewhat brighter than a few weeks ago', but he declined
to speculate on when AMR might return to profitability. He noted an autumn
fare promotion covered tickets for travel through much of the fourth
quarter, retarding recovery.
Shares in American's competitors also rose on the news. Delta gained Dollars
 3/4 at Dollars 59. UAL, parent of United Airlines, added Dollars 1 1/2 at
Dollars 120 1/8 .
The loss takes AMR's total deficit after tax in the first nine months of
1992 to Dollars 231m. In the same period of 1991, the airline made a net
loss of Dollars 115m. Third-quarter revenues totalled Dollars 3.73bn, a 5.9
per cent increase on last year's figure, and for the nine months were
Dollars 10.82bn against Dollars 9.48bn.
In the third quarter, American's load factor - the percentage of seats
filled with paying passengers - advanced from 66.8 per cent a year ago to
72.3 per cent, reflecting the boost in passenger traffic generated by cheap
fares. But the 'break-even' load factor also increased 62 per cent to 72.5
per cent.

FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Credit Lyonnais homes in on BfG - The
battle over the sale of a German bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THERE have been two bids for Germany's BfG bank in recent weeks
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one from a bank and one from a baker.
The offer from Mr Horst Schiesser, proprietor of a Berlin bakery, is in
keeping with the farce and intrigue which has characterised the long-running
cross-border imbroglio over Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB) -
Germany's second-biggest insurance company - and its BfG banking subsidiary.
However, this offer from Mr Schiesser, a man famous in Germany because he
once made an audacious but unsuccessful bid for the whole of eastern German
industry, was rejected out of hand by AMB.
Far more serious, from the point of AMB shareholders, is a bid that will be
put on AMB's table today by Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman of Credit
Lyonnais, one of France's largest banks.
He is meeting Mr Wolfgang Kaske, his opposite number at AMB, and is thought
likely to offer somewhere between DM1.8bn (Dollars 1.13bn) and DM3.6bn for a
60 per cent stake in BfG, Germany's sixth-biggest bank. Also attending the
meeting will be Mr Hans Matthofer, chief of BGAG, the trades union holding
company which is BfG's other shareholder.
Credit Lyonnais is keen to get into the German banking market, and BfG is
the only sizeable bank in Germany which is up for sale. Although there is
bound to be haggling over the price, it seems certain that a deal will be
done. This will pave the way for a resolution of AMB's fate.
AMB, with annual premium income of DM12bn and a market capitalisation of
around DM3.5bn, is the second-biggest participant after Allianz in the
German insurance market, Europe's largest. It bought its 50 per cent plus
one share stake in BfG five years ago in the hope of developing
cross-selling opportunities. Instead, it acquired a severe headache: the
troubled BfG has cost its shareholders several billion D-Marks and nearly
cost AMB its independence.
The imminent deal over BfG was the keystone of this summer's surprise
rapprochement between AMB and Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the big
state-owned French insurer. Mr Helmut Gies, chairman of AMB's supervisory
board, went over the heads of his management board - and shareholders - and
struck a deal with the French. Mr Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, then chief
executive, resigned in protest. Under the terms of the deal, AGF would help
find a French buyer for BfG, while the two big insurance companies would
work towards forging a closer business alliance.
Relations between the two, which had plumbed depths of hostility, have
improved dramatically. Unconfirmed reports suggest that representatives of
AGF and Dresdner Bank, its German ally, are about to be appointed to the AMB
management board.
So is the saga complete? Not quite, says Mr Nicolaus-Jurgen Weickart, a
Frankfurt lawyer. He has played an important role in Germany's limited
number of hostile takeovers. He intends to marshal the forces of AMB's
independent shareholders to challenge the AMB/AGF rapprochement. Acting on
behalf of a single, unidentified client who owns a 1 per cent stake in AMB,
he has gathered together a further 9 per cent of the company's shareholders
who, he says, are opposed to the deal.
'I find it astonishing that the ordinary shareholders in AMB have not had a
say in all this,' he says. 'The whole affair smacks of corporate Germany
putting together deals under the table in smoke-filled rooms. There has been
no transparency at all.'
In the absence of hard-and-fast rules governing takeover activity in
Germany, it is standard corporate practice to try to wrestle control by
buying a large blocking stake rather than making a full takeover bid. Mr
Weickart claims that the French are on the verge of obtaining effective
control of AMB - without having to pay a premium for that control and
without even making an offer to all shareholders.
Therefore he has taken steps which, he claims, may force AGF to make a full
bid for the company, to the benefit of ordinary institutional and other
shareholders. If this happened it would be a sensational development for M&amp;A
in continental Europe.
His strategy hangs on the fact that under a quirk of German corporate law,
AGF does not yet have full voting rights on its 25 per cent-plus stake. It
is up the AMB management board to recognise these rights, as it has said it
would do as part of this summer's reconciliation.
Mr Weickart's legal initiative means that shareholders will get the
opportunity to vote on the sale of BfG and on the move to recognise AGF's
votes at an extraordinary general meeting. AGF will not be able to vote its
full holding with the result that despite the support of large AMB
shareholders like Dresdner Bank and Munchener Re, the big Munich reinsurance
group, the vote may be close. If the vote is lost, AGF may be forced to make
a full bid.
A key role will be played by Fondiaria, the large Italian insurance company
which owns 20 per cent of AMB but whose interests have been marginalised as
a result of AGF's manoeuvres, Mr Weickart says.
The prospect of a closely-fought extraordinary general meeting - likely to
take place around the turn of the year - will ensure that the AMB saga has
at least several months left to run.

FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Morrison sticks to the simple truths - John
Thornhill tracks the impressive growth of food retailing's 'fashionable
frump'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN MANY ways Wm Morrison Supermarkets is the 'fashionable frump' of the food
retailing sector.
Largely unsullied by the temptations of publicity or the fleshpots of the
City, the northern grocery chain remains the repository of some simple
old-fashioned retailing truths which have served it extremely well since it
began trading from a Bradford market stall early this century.
Morrison's strong family culture, its obsession with providing good-value
foods at keen prices, and its recent aggressive organic growth have enabled
it to prosper in spite of the ever-growing power of the national grocery
groups.
While other regional grocers have suffered, Morrison has been able to lift
pre-tax profits from Pounds 25.7m to Pounds 62.6m between 1988 and 1992 and
last month reported a 34 per cent improvement at the interim stage. Analysts
are forecasting a rise to Pounds 84m for the full year.
The company's impressive progress has led many commentators to label it the
'Sainsbury's of the North' although in some respects even this compliment
underrates its recent achievements. Since the beginning of the year,
Morrison's share price has outperformed that of its illustrious southern
rival by 19 per cent. Its shares have outperformed Tesco by 47.5 per cent
over the same period.
It is, of course, often easier for a smaller and relatively immature company
to grow at a faster rate than a much bigger one, but Morrison's recent turn
of speed is nonetheless eye-catching.
And even in spite of the strong share price performance, Mr Bill Currie,
food retailing analyst at stockbrokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd, claims
Morrison is still 'the cheapest stock in the sector' predicting it is one of
the very few companies likely to sustain 20 per cent earnings growth for the
foreseeable future.
'Morrison's offer the deepest range, the best service and the cheapest
prices in the sector and that is a pretty powerful combination,' he says.
But Morrison has not always received such rave ratings - especially at the
beginning of the 1980s when it consistently underperformed its peers.
After opening its first supermarket in a converted cinema in 1962, Morrison
grew very slowly in its early years and - in spite of going public in 1967 -
was rapidly outpaced by its Yorkshire rivals, Asda and Hillards.
Unlike its competitors, Morrison insisted on buying the freeholds on all its
stores and funded expansion out of cashflow. 'We were against borrowing
until the mid-1980s and were quite happy knowing that nobody could take away
what we had got. But I suppose we came round to the view that there was
merit in gearing up and speeding the business up a bit,' says Mr Martin
Ackroyd, finance director.
Confident in the strength of its format and bolstered by the cash from last
year's Pounds 98m rights issue, Morrison has now markedly accelerated its
opening programme and is currently opening stores at a proportionately
faster rate than even the likes of Sainsbury and Tesco.
The company currently has 59 stores and says it will open seven or so stores
a year for the foreseeable future.
Joining the great superstore building game comparatively late has given
Morrison several advantages. Its geographical concentration in Yorkshire and
the north of England has eased its distribution arrangements. And, unlike
its competitors, the company does not possess a straggling tail of high
street stores.
About a third of Morrison's trading space is now less than three years old
enabling the company to operate more efficiently, generate higher margins
and better resist competitor openings. Its average store size is 34,000 sq
ft stocking about 14,000 lines. 'We run the 59 shops as one,' says Mr
Ackroyd. 'We have one product list and most of the product range is based on
unitary pricing.'
The company is well known for being mean about what it will pay for sites
and the average full cost of building its stores is very low at Pounds 13m
apiece. The company scours northern towns for suitable opportunities, but
does not indulge in the sophisticated site selection processes of the
national chains. 'There is one thing we need when we open a store and that
is chimney pots. Where there are chimney pots there are likely to be
people,' says Mr Ackroyd.
Morrison believes that its stores should cover their costs - including
interest - from day one and immediately contribute to profits. Unlike the
national chains, it has also adopted the highly prudent accounting policy of
depreciating its land assets.
Mr Ackroyd says he is staggered by some of the prices that some of the other
supermarkets pay for their stores.
'Some of the site prices you see being bandied about are incredible. I could
not pay those prices and make any money out of them. I can never see the
turnover to justify the prices they pay for their sites,' he says.
He accepts that Morrison's stores are affected by competitor openings but
stresses that 'we refuse to allow anyone else to run our business for us'.
The comparative savings that the company can make in building its stores can
be passed to customers in the form of lower prices helping to defend its
market share.
'We do not worry about what the competition is doing. There is only one
thing that matters and that is providing consistent value. You can never con
your customers,' he says.
'They are the ones who decide what value means. It might mean free car
parking. It might be they like the staff. It might be the products. But
every week they look at the bill and feel that is what they have got for
their money and they have got to feel satisfied,' he says.
Such views and values have been instilled in the company by the chairman, Mr
Ken Morrison, who has worked in the business for 40 years and whose family
still owns 39 per cent of its shares. 'Ken Morrison is the boss first,
second and third. He is intimately involved in every aspect of the
business,' says Mr Ackroyd.
True to the company's priorities, perhaps, Mr Morrison was not available for
a tentatively-promised interview - he had gone off to open another store
instead.
Yet his influence is still the guiding spirit of the company and one of the
few reservations expressed by the company's investors is what will happen
when he retires.
But judging by the approach of those who are left in the company's
headquarters, investors have little to fear.
'Our customers are the only people who matter. If we can satisfy them then I
can assure you we will satisfy the shareholders,' says Mr Ackroyd.

Shares in JD Wetherspoon, the chain of 44 Greater London pubs which offers
cheap real ale and no music, were yesterday priced at 160p, giving the group
a market capitalisation of Pounds 45.6m, writes Andrew Bolger.
The flotation price represents a p/e ratio of 12.4p and the notional gross
dividend yield is 4 per cent.
Some 14.68m shares, representing 51 per cent of the group's enlarged share
capital, have already been firmly placed with institutions.
A further 5.3m shares have been provisionally placed, but are subject to
clawback by financial intermediaries for sale to private clients. The
intermediaries' offer will close next Tuesday. Dealing will begin on Friday
October 30.
The flotation was sponsored by Kleinwort Benson.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Volume fall hits House of Lerose
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECLINE in volume from its branded businesses, both in the UK and the
Netherlands, was the main reason for a sharp fall, from Pounds 425,000 to
Pounds 51,000, in pre-tax profits at House of Lerose in the first half of
1992.
Turnover at the women's wear group dropped from Pounds 7.8m to Pounds 6.47m.
Earnings per share fell sharply from 4.9p to 0.6p, but the interim dividend
is held at 3p.
Mr Martin Rose, chairman, said efforts were being concentrated on the design
and marketing of products. It was unlikely these would have a significant
impact until later in 1993.
Net cash balances were Pounds 8.5m at June 30, against Pounds 6.8m six
months earlier. A further Pounds 1.1m has been added by a pension fund
surplus.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Credit Lyonnais poised to take control of BfG bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, one of France's largest banks, today enters the final stage
of negotiations to buy a controlling stake in BfG Bank, the financially
troubled German bank owned by Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs, the
German insurance group, and the BGAG German trades union holding company.
The French bank, which has been seeking a base in Germany as part of its
European expansion programme, confirmed yesterday that Mr Jean-Yves Haberer,
its chairman, would meet Mr Wolfgang Kaske, AMB chief executive, in Germany
today. Mr Hans Matthofer, BGAG chairman, will also attend.
Credit Lyonnais is thought to have made a concrete offer for a total of 60
per cent of the bank's shares earlier this week.
None of the parties involved would comment on the price yesterday but
sources suggested the figure could be between DM1.8bn (Pounds 720m) and
DM3.6bn.
BfG, as Germany's sixth-largest bank, provides a rare opportunity for a
foreign company to buy a large German financial institution.
The bank has cost its shareholders several billion D-Marks since AMB
acquired its majority stake five years ago. A further cash injection is
required but the main brunt of restructuring is over, the bank has said
recently.
The negotiations follow this summer's reconciliation between AMB and
Assurances Generales de France (AGF), a big state-owned French insurer which
has acquired a 25 per cent stake in the German company.
Hostilities ended this summer and as part of the deal AGF undertook to find
a French buyer for BfG. A successful sale could lead to further co-operation
between AGF and AMB, including recognition of voting rights on its full
stake.
Today's talks between Credit Lyonnais and AMB come amid controversy over the
aggressive expansion strategy pursued by Mr Haberer.
Its net profits fell from FFr1.61bn in the first half of 1991 to FFr119m
(Pounds 14.2m) in the same period this year, mainly because of higher
provisions on bad debts and depressed property holdings. However, Mr Haberer
has confounded critics of his expensively acquired European network which
has performed well.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Isosceles fails to sell Herman's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the heavily indebted buy-out vehicle for the Gateway food retail
chain, has lost a chance to sell Herman's Sporting Goods, its US subsidiary.
A buyer for the chain had been at an advanced stage of negotiations but
pulled out late last week.
This will be further bad news for Isosceles' shareholders and the banks
which are owed more than Pounds 1.2bn.
Rumours about the group's poor trading and unrest among its lenders have
been circulating in the City of London.
The company is said to be in discussions with its bankers over another
adjustment to its financial structure only two weeks after a refinancing -
its second since the Pounds 2.1bn takeover in 1989 - was approved by
shareholders.
Insiders say, however, that Isosceles' more pressing problem is its trading
performance, which is not meeting budgets and appears to be worsening.
The Herman's buyer which dropped out is believed to have been Odyssey, a New
York-based buy-out capital group.
Isosceles is thought to have other possible buyers for Herman's, although at
a lower price. It will have to start again with the usual lengthy
negotiating process with another purchaser.
Even the Odyssey bid is thought to have been at a price below the level to
which Isosceles had written down its investment in Herman's in its latest
accounts for the financial year to April 25 this year.
Isosceles, which has been trying to sell Herman's ever since its bid for
Gateway succeeded, cut Pounds 144.8m from the value of Herman's during the
year.
Herman's forms the bulk of Isosceles' 'investments held for disposal' which
were put at Pounds 57.7m in the balance sheet.
Herman's made a Dollars 1m (Pounds 600,000) operating profit in the 1991-92
financial year, its first operating profit since Isosceles took over
Gateway.
Herman's has suffered in the dismal US retailing market, although Isosceles
claims to have addressed many of the weaknesses in the business.
Last week Isosceles sold Wellworth, its northern Irish supermarket for
Pounds 128m, including repayment of debt. This was also at a price below
earlier hopes.

<TEXT>
No one can accuse the the Natural Law party of shirking the big tasks. In
April's general election it signally failed to break the mould of British
politics, gaining not one seat. But it is fielding a candidate for the US
presidency, John Hagelin, who has a PhD in nuclear physics from Harvard.
Moreover it has passed the hurdles necessary to get federal funding. The US
Federal Election Commission voted unanimously on September 17 and again on
October 15 to award the party - which bases itself on the teachings of the
Maharishi Mahesh Yogi - 'national party committee status'.
The Natural Law party is on the ballot in 32 states and has at least 100
candidates running for federal and state office. But despite getting 235,000
signatures to get onto the ballot in California, the party submitted them
two weeks after the deadline; the one state it might have done well in will
now not have any candidates.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Survey of Leman Region (6): Geneva pulls them in -
International Organisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the post-Cold War world, Geneva is being forced into battle to retain its
pre-eminence as Europe's 'international' city. Swiss neutrality is no longer
a special advantage.
The political centre of Europe is shifting eastwards, boosting the claims of
rivals such as Berlin, Vienna and Prague. These and other European cities,
notably Bonn, have been trying to lure the United Nations and other
international organisations with a range of financial incentives, including
free office space and accommodation.
Geneva and the Swiss government are fighting back, with mixed success. The
loss to The Hague earlier this year of the 1,000-strong secretariat to
administer the forthcoming UN treaty outlawing chemical weapons was a big
blow. Geneva is now in competition with UN headquarters in New York for the
much smaller Commission on Sustainable Development, the body that will
follow up the ambitious agenda set at the UN 'Earth Summit' in Rio de
Janeiro last June.
Among the 15 UN organisations already based in Geneva are the UN's European
headquarters, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the International Labour
Organisation (ILO), the High Commissioner for Refugees and the World
Meteorological Organisation. The city is also home to the International
Committee of the Red Cross, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt) and the European particle physics laboratory, CERN. Along the lake in
Vaud are the World-Wide Fund for Nature (WWF International) at Gland and the
International Olympic Committee in Lausanne.
Capturing and keeping UN bodies in Geneva involves high economic stakes for
both canton and region. According to the Cantonal Statistics Service, 46 per
cent of the UN's 21,700 staff live in France and spend much of their
salaries there, compared with 44 per cent who live in Geneva. Another 10 per
cent commute from Vaud.
Most of the SFr3bn spent last year by the international organisations went
to the region in salaries or payments to local companies. In all, the
international sector accounts for about 10 per cent of cantonal income and
about the same proportion of employment. When non-government organisations
and diplomats from the 131 countries with UN missions in Geneva are
included, total international employment was about 25,600 last year.
The benefits are felt indirectly, too. 'International Geneva' has pulled in
a range of private companies, research bodies and lobby groups. For Du Pont
and Glaxo, for example, proximity to the WHO was one reason for siting
international operations in Geneva.
UN meetings and conferences also generate huge amounts of business for
Geneva airport and the city's hotels, restaurants, taxis and public
transport. The 90,300 delegates who attended 1,672 UN-sponsored meetings in
Geneva last year accounted for 40 per cent of hotel bed-nights.
Geneva's principal handicap is the high cost of living, which makes it one
of Europe's most expensive cities. There is also the curious anomaly that
Switzerland is still not a UN member although it belongs to most UN
agencies. But the city and its surrounds also boast considerable advantages
as a result of the existing congregation of international organisations.
Most UN members already have representative missions in Geneva - an
important consideration for poorer, smaller countries. International
transport links and telecommunications are excellent. The city is
multilingual. The necessary infrastructure - such as conference facilities
and hotel accommodation - is in place. The proximity of related
organisations makes, at least in theory, for better co-ordination and
efficiency.
In its unusually high-profile campaign to host the Sustainable Development
Commission, the Swiss government has emphasised the large number of
environmental and related bodies which have already made the region their
home.
Swiss interest in the Sustainable Development Commission stems less from its
size - no more than 50 people - than its possible 'multiplier' effects in
making Geneva a 'world environment capital'. The government is offering to
subsidise the Commission to the tune of SFr1.5m a year for its first five
years. Like other UN bodies in Geneva, it will also be given a free site and
a subsidised loan for building by FIPOI (the Buildings Foundation for
International Organisations), which is run jointly by the canton and the
confederation. Over the past 25 years, cheap credits extended by the
foundation have totalled more than SFr750m.
The government has in addition offered the UN SFr60m towards construction of
an international environment centre which would bring together in one
building all the various UN and many non-governmental bodies now scattered
around the city and neighbouring areas.
The Swiss even have the perfect building in mind - the lakeside Palais
Wilson, first seat of the pre-war League of Nations, which is due for
reconstruction after being partly destroyed by fire in 1987.
Heading the Swiss campaign is Mr Jurg Leutert, of the directorate for
international organisations in the Swiss Foreign Ministry. He and other
Swiss officials have visited some 50 capitals in recent weeks to drum up
support for Geneva, emphasising not only financial incentives but also
Geneva's independence from the political imbroglio of the UN in New York.
'If countries want a strong independent Commission, they should decide on
Geneva', Mr Leutert says.
Despite support from, among others, the US and the Arab League, Mr Leutert
puts Geneva's chances at no more than 50-50 when the decision comes before
the UN General Assembly in New York early in November. UN cost-paring, as
well as politics, may decide the outcome. On that decision may also hang the
future location of another, even smaller, offshoot of Rio, the secretariat
for the convention on biodiversity, where Geneva is in competition with
Seville.
Mr Leutert says that even if Geneva loses the fight for the Sustainable
Development Commission, the environment centre will still go ahead. And Mr
Michel Constantin, director of FIPOI, is confident that international
organisations already in Geneva will not leave whatever the temptations
elsewhere. It would simply cost too much to do so, he says.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sharpening the image
 -Gillette and Avon are launching multi-million pound promotional campaigns
to re-establish their brand names
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tinkering with a brand image is a dangerous game. But when competitive
pressure reaches critical mass, there is little choice.
Two of the oldest brand names in mass-market personal care products have
decided that now is the time for a rethink. The experience of both Avon
(founded in 1886) and Gillette (1903) shows that even leading brands can be
vulnerable.
Both companies lost sight of their core strategies in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, diversifying and thereby losing ground to competitors. Gillette
followed the pack into disposable razors; Avon took its eye off its main
market, cosmetics.
Companies with successful brand name longevity appear to concentrate on
doing one thing supremely well and keeping a single brand name firmly at the
forefront of consumer awareness.
Thus Gillette has now decided that the future for its personal care division
 -one of three divisions - is to attempt to replicate the success of its
non-disposable razor, Sensor, which is heavily branded with the Gillette
name. Gillette's new male toiletries range - launched in London recently
with more dry ice and flashing lights than a Christmas panto - is called
Gillette Series. The 13-product range results from Dollars 75m (Pounds
43.6m) spent on research and development.
The new line is backed by a Dollars 75m marketing budget in its first year
in three launch markets, the US, Canada and the UK. The company's UK
marketing budget of Pounds 15m for Gillette Series is 12 per cent of its
turnover in the British shaving business.
Bruce Cleverly, Gillette's general manager for northern Europe, says the
company is trying to develop a 'mega-brand strategy. In 1988 we said we
really needed to do something about the Gillette business, it's becoming a
commodity market, we have a lot of well-known sub-brands but our biggest
strength is the name Gillette and we really haven't treated that brand name
with the importance it deserves.'
Thus when Sensor was launched in 1990, it was accompanied by a global
advertising campaign which hinged on emphasising the Gillette brand name,
with the slogan, 'Gillette, the best a man can get.'
Sensor revived the company's fortunes which had been flagging under pressure
from the plastic disposable razor, bought on price, not brand name. But the
premium-priced Sensor launch was not just about new product development. It
coincided with restored marketing budgets, which (measured in 1987 terms)
had in the US fallen from Dollars 61m in 1975 to Dollars 15m in 1987.
Gillette is minimising risk of failure for its new range by taking a leaf
out of the successful Sensor campaign and piggy-backing on a reinvigorated
brand name.
Avon, the US cosmetics company, had a different set of problems which
largely flowed from the changing nature of industrialised society. For a
company which depended on direct selling, one big social change - women
increasingly leaving the home in the 1970s and 1980s to go to work - was a
serious problem.
Avon's US sales rep force fell by 10 per cent between 1980-84, to 400,000.
Americans are annually working an average 158 hours more than 20 years ago;
fewer people are interested in part-time selling and there are fewer at home
to buy.
Avon diversified into speciality chemicals and healthcare, moving from being
in 1982 almost debt-free to having debts of Dollars 1.13bn in 1989. That, in
turn, attracted four unwelcome takeover bids in three years.
Jim Preston, the current chief executive, took over in mid-1988 with a brief
to return the company to its core cosmetic business and reverse the tide. He
sold off peripheral companies. Sales increased from Dollars 3bn in 1988 to
Dollars 3.6bn in 1991; debt has been reduced to Dollars 352m at the end of
1991.
In the process, Preston has carved Avon's globe in two, with different
marketing strategies for industrial and emerging economies. With the latter,
he anticipates sales growth of 10-12 per cent annually, largely using the
tested method of direct sale reps.
But it is in already highly developed markets where Avon faces stiffest
competition, and where Preston hopes the company's revamped image will make
the most difference: 'Our key challenges in these developed markets are
image and access.'
Preston acknowledges that Avon has had a very dowdy image. To counter that,
Avon is quadrupling its advertising budgets, taking it to 2-3 per cent of
sales over the next two years, and turning towards images more in tune with
contemporary women.
The new advertising campaigns hope to make a virtue out of the declining
numbers of house-bound women in developed economies, by making it possible
to purchase Avon products via fax, telephone and mail, as well as the
traditional sale rep.
Now using the generic slogan 'It's never been so simple to look so great',
Avon's new global advertising campaigns try to combine its old strength -
ease of purchase - with a new appeal to sophisticated lifestyle. But Avon
faces serious competition in the estimated Dollars 45bn global personal
products market. The market is relatively fragmented with 70 per cent in the
hands of some 15 companies.
However, four of the big five - Procter &amp; Gamble (US), L'Oreal (France),
Unilever (Anglo-Dutch) and Shiseido (Japan) - spent the late 1980s making
acquisitions which, unlike Avon's, meshed into their existing core
businesses. Avon's recent expansions into China, east Europe and other
emerging economies make sense; but closer to home its greatest need is for
its own current facelift.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Capital body plans to boost London pride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PARTNERSHIP between the private and public sectors aimed at maintaining
and enhancing the reputation of London as a world-class city was launched
yesterday.
London First aims to harness leadership and management skills, encourage
investment, improve the quality of services and boost civic pride in the
capital. It seeks to make up for the lack of a strategic body with
responsibility for London.
Behind the launch is the belief that more effort is needed from both the
public and the private sectors to promote London to ensure it can meet
growing competition for trade and tourism from New York, Tokyo, Paris,
Berlin, Frankfurt and a host of other cities. Its first programmes will
focus on education and training, transport, economic development and the
quality of life.
The new organisation will work closely with London Forum, a private-sector
body announced by the government in July to promote London internationally
and to expand the capital's role as a centre for tourism and culture. Core
funding for both bodies will come from the private sector.
Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and group chief executive of leisure group
Grand Metropolitan, is to be chairman of both organisations, and to ensure a
consistency of approach they will share a common executive committee chaired
by Mr Stephen O'Brien, executive vice-chairman of Business in the Community,
which promotes links between companies and local communities.
Sir Allen said that the lack of a strategic body for London had generated an
important debate on how best to maintain the quality of London's living and
working environment and to secure its status as a world capital.
He added: 'This debate has led to the establishment of the two separate
initiatives of London Forum, which will concentrate on promoting London, and
London First, which will concentrate on making London promotable.
'London First will provide the much-needed strategic framework and will act
as a catalyst for the many initiatives already under way. My role as
chairman of both bodies will be to ensure that the two organisations work
together closely and effectively in pursuing their respective objectives.'
A further link between the two organisations is Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman
of leisure group Wembley, who has been appointed as London First's deputy
chairman and a member of London Forum.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, welcomed the initiative, calling
it 'a new boost for London'. He supported the proposal to increase the
capital's profile overseas with a campaign in north America, Japan and
Europe.
London First has no political affiliation. It has support from more than 40
companies, the Confederation of British Industry, London Tourist Board,
Business in the Community, London Chamber of Commerce &amp; Industry, and the
London Training and Enterprise Councils.
The four areas chosen for the initial studies will be addressed by strategy
teams led by the deputy chairmen and deputy chairwoman of London First.
They are Dr John Ashworth, director of the London School of Economics, who
will focus on education and training, Mr Peter Foy, a senior partner of
McKinsey &amp; Co (transport), Mr Stuart Hampson, deputy chairman of the John
Lewis Partnership (economic development), and Dr Anna Mann, managing
director of the Whitehead Mann Group (quality of life).
The intention is to draw on the models of leadership teams developed in the
US, and by Business in the Community and the CBI in the UK.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Jaguar to invest Pounds 7m in car plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR, the UK luxury car maker bought by Ford in 1989, is to invest about
Pounds 7m at its assembly plant in Browns Lane, Coventry, to modernise the
final assembly track.
The investment, the first significant expenditure at the plant for more than
20 years, will allow Jaguar to introduce more modern assembly methods,
including so-called 'doors-off' assembly.
This technique has become commonplace in modern car plants. It allows the
doors to be built as sub-assemblies away from the main assembly track,
enabling easier vehicle access for other assembly operations.
The doors are fitted later in the assembly process, which helps to improve
quality and working conditions for line workers.
The outdated Browns Lane assembly facility was neglected during earlier
heavy investment by Jaguar in its engineering operations and in its body
welding plant. The assembly track will be modernised next summer during the
plant shutdown, which will be extended to three weeks.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S six leading trading houses have reached an agreement to conduct a
feasibility study into the building of a Dollars 4bn petrochemical complex
in the northern Chinese province of Liaoning.
The complex would be one of the largest foreign investment projects in
China. Mitsubishi Corporation, the trading house, said yesterday the
Japanese side would provide at least 51 per cent of the Dollars 4bn.
Mitsubishi said the Chinese government had given formal permission for the
feasibility study, likely to begin early next year and take at least a year
to complete.
If all goes to plan, the complex, which will include an oil refinery and a
450,000-tonne-a-year ethylene facility, would be completed by the end of the
decade.
The proposal by the six partners, also including Marubeni Corp, Sumitomo
Corp, Mitsui &amp; Co, Itochu, and Nissho Iwai, is a reflection of the
heightened interest in China as a site for production facilities. Japanese
investment in China rose from Dollars 349m (Pounds 203m) in 1990 to Dollars
579m last year.
Mitsubishi said some of the required oil for the plant is likely to come
from the northern Chinese field of Daqing, and the remainder will be
imported. It is likely the Chinese government will insist that a fixed
percentage of the ethylene output be exported to earn foreign exchange,
while the rest would meet fast-growing demand within China.
The Chinese government recently approved equipment imports for a
300,000-tonne ethylene facility in the southern province of Guangdong.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Four German groups announce cuts as business climate worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE wave of cost-cutting measures sweeping through German industry yesterday
hit white-collar and production workers in four leading companies.
AEG, the appliance and electrical engineering arm of Daimler-Benz, said it
would cut its 940-strong headquarters workforce in Frankfurt to less than
200. Only 120 jobs would be lost in the attempt to improve efficiency and
devolve decision-making; the other staff would be found work elsewhere in
the group.
ANT Nachrichtentechnik, an electronics company in the Robert Bosch group,
announced 800 job losses.
Diesel engine and plant maker Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, which has already
announced 1,000 job losses, is to put 2,000 workers on short-time, and
Continental, the tyre manufacturer, announced plans to reduce output by
extending the Christmas holiday.
The rapid deterioration in German business conditions was further underlined
by news from MAN Gutehoffnungshutte, an engineering division of the MAN
group, that losses had increased this year to DM23.5m (Pounds 9.5m) after a
DM6m deficit in 1991.
There were also further warnings that the country could be on the verge of
recession. Economists at the BHF Bank said the pattern of rising prices and
falling demand was reminiscent of previous slumps.
However, they added, the prospects for avoiding recession were better than
in the past. Favourable indicators included the relatively early easing of
interest rates coupled with the lower import prices stemming from the
D-Mark's appreciation.
The difficulties at MAN and KHD reflect a downturn in foreign and domestic
engineering demand which will lead to industry-wide production falling by 5
per cent this year.
The slow-down at Continental has been prompted by a sharp fall in incoming
orders from the motor industry, which has said it needs to shed 200,000
workers to remain competitive.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Dietrich bracelet leads sale: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RUBY bracelet, created for Marlene Dietrich in 1937 by the Paris jeweller
Louis Arpels, sold for Dollars 990,000 (Pounds 608,668) at Sotheby's in New
York on Tuesday - more than double the estimate.
The bracelet was formed from various of her jewels and the actress described
it as her 'Busby Berkeley bracelet - as it is so wonderfully large and
splashy'. She wore it often and featured it in the movie Stage Fright.
The Dietrich piece was a highlight of a successful jewels auction totalling
Dollars 17.1m (Pounds 10.5m) with 86 per cent sold. There was an auction
record for pearls when a necklace of 23 cultured pearls with a platinum and
diamond clasp sold for Dollars 2.3m (Pounds 1.4m).
All 99 lots in the collection of the late Mrs Harry Winston, wife of one of
the most innovative jewellery designers of the 20th century, found buyers,
bringing in Dollars 5.18m (Pounds 3.2m). A pair of diamond chandelier
pendant ear clips, made in 1961, sold for Dollars 1.4m (Pounds 879,188).
Christie's in London was disposing yesterday of the library of the late John
Sparrow, the Warden of All Souls, Oxford, and an inveterate book collector.
Virtually everything sold and prices far exceeded estimate. Top price was
the Pounds 7,700, more than twice the forecast, for a 1790 set of Johnson's
The Works of the English Poets.
To complete this sudden revival in the art market, Sotheby's met strong
dealer demand yesterday for the contents of Shadwell Park near Thetford,
Norfolk. A Regency sofa table, estimated at up to Pounds 20,000, sold for
Pounds 75,900.

FT  22 OCT 92 / South Africans rule out early return to single currency: Why
the financial rand is here to stay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE gyrations in the financial rand, which earlier this month slipped to a
six-year low and a discount of over 40 per cent against the commercial rand,
are clear evidence South Africa will not be making an early return to a
single currency.
Dr Chris Stals, governor of the Reserve Bank, underlined the point yesterday
when he saidthe large discount 'proves again that we still need the
financial rand to protect the foreign reserves and make a relatively stable
commercial rand possible.'
He went on to stress that, although the bank had announced in March that it
would be intervening in the financial rand market, this was not a commitment
to stabilise the currency.
The intervention, he said, was mainly aimed at draining excess liquidity
from the money markets caused by large increases in foreign reserves.
Stabilisation, achieved during April and May when the financial rand
discount fluctuated between the narrow margins of 15 to 18 per cent, was a
beneficial adjunct of intervention, not its aim.
'We just cannot commit ourselves as the Reserve Bank to support this
exchange rate at all times,' Dr Stals said.
At least two conditions would have to be met for the bank to be in a
position to stabilise the financial rand: 'much higher' foreign reserves
than the current level of R11.5bn, and a 'more stable political situation
where the financial rand exchange rate will be determined more by economic
considerations than by political considerations.'
The financial rand has strengthened somewhat since its precipitous fall on
October 5, which saw it close at R4.83 to the dollar, a discount of 41 per
cent to the commercial rand.
At one stage that day, the financial rand traded at R5.11, having last past
R5.10 in October 1986. Yesterday, it closed at R4.36 to the dollar, a
discount of 33 per cent to the commercial rand, which closed at R2.92 to the
dollar.
Analysts ascribe the widening of the financial rand discount to two main
factors: continued negative political sentiment, and a perception that South
African companies are increasingly being allowed to invest abroad. There
have recently been a number of foreign acquisitions by South African
companies, mainly financial institutions, and these are conducted through
the financial rand.
Dr Stals says that the recent volatility is partially attributable to
worldwide nervousness in foreign exchange markets. He downplays the
importance of South African companies investing offshore, saying: 'The
initiatives were taken more by the foreign investors who wanted to sell than
by South African investors who wanted to buy foreign exchange.'
The financial rand was introduced in 1985 as a means of protecting the
balance of payments. It is a barometer of foreign investor sentiment: when
the rand is in demand, the discount to the commercial rand narrows, and vice
versa.
Until this year, there had been a steady narrowing of the discount, which
fell from 53 per cent at the end of 1986 to a low of 7 per cent in November
1991. Since then, events like the Boipatong massacre and the breakdown of
constitutional talks have caused the discount to widen.
The sharp weakening in the currency over the past two weeks is a mixed
blessing for foreign investors, who are thought to hold as much as 45 per
cent of the South African government bond market.
One the one hand, it makes returns more lucrative. Syfrets, a Cape-based
investment institution, says that its Income Fund was yielding a return of
more than 20 per cent for non-residents compared to the 14.1 per cent return
on gilts available to local residents. On the other, a weak financial rand
can make the repatriation of funds a costly and difficult process.
Indeed, while the Reserve Bank can take comfort from the protection afforded
to foreign reserves by the financial rand, it will be acutely conscious that
this stability was not achieved without a price. Foreign investors for one,
many of whom have suffered large losses on the financial rand, have not been
slow in making their displeasure felt.
Speaking at a financial conference in Johannesburg yesterday, Dr Stals told
his audience of the letters that he had received from these investors,
variously describing the country as a 'banana republic' and unfit to invest
in with such a volatile currency.
For a country anxious to attract foreign investment, those words will have
found their mark. Insofar as it can, the bank will certainly be striving to
avoid a repetition of the recent volatility.

FT  22 OCT 92 / De Klerk to force through amnesty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAPE TOWN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S president, Mr F W de Klerk, yesterday decided to force into
law a bill allowing him to grant secret amnesty to security force members
for apartheid crimes, after it was rejected by the segregated parliament.
It is the first time he has overruled parliament since taking office in
September 1989, and demonstrates the heavy pressure he is under from his own
security forces to provide amnesties before a multi-racial interim
government takes power, probably some time next year.
Earlier in the day, the president suffered a humiliating defeat when Indian
legislators blocked the bill in parliament. He said last night he would
refer the bill to the multi-party President's Council, a section of the
executive branch of government dominated by his National Party.
The President's Council was designed to overcome exactly those circumstances
which arose yesterday: defeat of the governing party in one of the non-white
houses of the three-chamber parliament.
If a bill is defeated in any house - - white, coloured or Indian - it cannot
become law without being referred to the President's Council (the 308-seat
parliament debates jointly, but legislators vote separately according to
race).
Mr de Klerk is likely to be sharply criticised by opposition parties for
using such an undemocratic mechanism to frustrate parliament's will.
African National Congress officials said yesterday they would nullify any
amnesties granted under the law. They did not expect the bill to prove a
serious obstacle to constitutional negotiations.
Mr de Klerk claims the legislation is necessary to complete the release of
ANC political prisoners, but lawyers dispute this, believing its main aim is
to protect the security forces.
Liberal Democratic party spokesman, Mr Tony Leon, called it a 'charter for
crooks, criminals and assassins'. He said: 'It massively widens the net of.
. . . state killers and others in this rogue's gallery of South Africa's
terror who will now qualify to walk away from their deeds unnamed, undis
closed and unpunished.'

FT  22 OCT 92 / Uzbekistan holds to the old school: The Soviet-period
instincts that are slowing a reform of the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UZBEKISTAN's president, Mr Islam Karimov, appears anxious to persuade
frustrated foreign investors that he really is committed to free trade
policies. However his success may be hampered by his efforts to sustain his
government with a crackdown on his opponents.
Mr Karimov, an ex-Communist party boss whose Soviet-period instincts have,
until now, made for a slow pace of economic reform in this central Asian
republic, has been all but forced into a more liberal investment policy.
Experts say there will be at least a 15 per cent drop this year in
Uzbekistan's key foreign currency earner, its huge cotton harvest, so Mr
Karimov has moved to try to widen the country's economic base.
A new investment decree that took effect in August removed customs duties on
consumer products, suspended duties on all imports up until January 1994,
and relaxed rules on reinvestment of profit made by foreigners.
No one knows whether Mr Karimov will later render his decree ineffective by
issuing 'refinements', as he has done in the past. For now, though, the
small foreign community - attracted mostly by the 4.5m tonne annual cotton
harvest, in addition to ample gold and newly-found oil deposits - is
cautiously optimistic. 'I think there will finally be consumer goods in
Uzbekistan,' beamed Mr Abbas Khan, local manager of Karachi-based Tabani
Corp, who has lived in Tashkent for more than a decade.
Investor caution stems from Mr Karimov's past. The 51-year-old president is
among the former Soviet Union's least repentant ex-party bosses. The
accepted wisdom is that nothing of consequence happens in Uzbekistan without
his consent. He has been only a little less than rigid when it comes to
relaxing central control of the economy, and is absolutely intolerant of
opposition. Unlike its more flexible Central Asian neighbours, Uzbekistan is
probably not headed for any dramatic economic or political changes under Mr
Karimov's leadership.
Last October, he freed collective farmers to sell part of their cotton
harvest to the lucrative export market. Only six months later, he issued a
second decree requiring the farmers first to get permission from a
government office - effectively reversing his liberalisation.
Meanwhile, one by one almost all of Mr Karimov's critics have fled, been
arrested, or simply disappeared over the last few months. Three months ago,
the opposition leader, Mr Abdourahim Pulatov, was summoned to a government
office, outside of which a group of young thugs beat him with steel bars. He
is said to be recovering in a Turkish hospital. Mr Karimov has denied any
role, saying that the men's target was not Mr Pulatov, but somebody
accompanying the opposition leader.
To some degree Mr Karimov's policies are a reflection of his fear of
undirected change. The instability and fighting in neighbouring Tajikistan
and Afghanistan have particularly worried him, and he has ordered his troops
to seal up Uzbekistan's borders to prevent an inflow of arms.
Foreign businessmen do not seem particularly dismayed by Mr Karimov's
crackdown. But with cotton playing a central role in the country's economy,
they are becoming concerned about the 1992 cotton crop, which, despite signs
to the contrary, the government insists will meet forecasts.
As the world's third largest cotton producer, Uzbekistan depends on raw
cotton and textiles for 68 per cent - or Dollars 1bn - of its exports. But
foreign cotton experts say this year's unusually heavy rains in some cases
have forced farmers to replant ruined crops four times, as new flooding
destroyed each new planting.
They say the yield could fall even further than 15 per cent from the
forecast of 2.6 tonnes of raw cotton per hectare. Uzbek officials refuse to
accelerate their rigid, 30-day picking schedule, and the harvest thus could
spill over into November, when the rainy season begins and picking must be
halted.
Meanwhile, Mr Karimov is looking to other investors for hard currency. Oil
and gold deposits are particularly promising.
Oil was struck in March in the Fergana valley city of Namangan, and some
experts say there is more to be found. Mr Sadiq Safaev, deputy minister of
foreign economic affairs, says that US, Saudi Arabian and South Korean
companies have already submitted bids for separate joint ventures for
extraction, refinement and transportation at the Namangan site.
And analysts believe there is immediate potential in the country's gold
mines at Zarafshan. Uzbekistan is already the world's seventh largest gold
producer, and Mr Karimov is increasing production.
In a Dollars 75m deal with Denver-based Newman Mining Corp, the Uzbek
government will provide labour and energy, and the US company will
contribute technology, to extract 10m tonnes of gold annually, according to
Mr Safaev.
Regardless of Mr Karimov's eagerness to earn more foreign exchange, or
whether his new decree will hold, no one believes he will veer dramatically
from his plodding course.
'Uzbekistan has chosen the slower way to a market economy,' said Mr Vladimir
Ergashbayev, the vice-president of the Tashkent Stock Exchange. 'We think
that for a long time state structures will be the main part of the economy.'

FT  22 OCT 92 / Competition review clears detergent makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading said yesterday it had decided not to ask the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission to investigate competition in the laundry
detergents market.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director general of fair trading, said he had seriously
considered the case for a monopoly reference. He had decided against it
after a review by the OFT found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by
Procter &amp; Gamble of the US and Lever Brothers of the UK, which dominate the
business.
Sir Bryan said he would continue to watch out for evidence that P&amp;G and
Lever Brothers were abusing their market power. The two companies account
for about 90 per cent of laundry detergent sales, worth more than Pounds
800m a year.
Sir Bryan said detailed financial information provided by the companies did
not show that price competition was ineffective and he was encouraged by
recent improvements in productivity.
The OFT has monitored the detergents market since 1981 when P&amp;G and Lever
Brothers, part of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, were released from
undertakings imposed after an MMC investigation in 1966.
The OFT launched a more detailed review almost two years ago, prompted by a
sharp rise in the two companies' advertising expenditure.
According to Register-MEAL, a market research company, total advertising
spending on laundry detergents rose to Pounds 69m last year from Pounds 12m
in 1982, with a particularly sharp increase in the past five years.
Sir Bryan said he had been concerned that high levels of advertising
spending might prevent new competitors from entering the market. He had
noted the companies' argument that the spending was needed to support a
faster rate of product innovation.
Sir Bryan said: 'At the present time, competition between Procter &amp; Gamble
and Lever Brothers appears to be active, and there is also competition from
retailer own-label brands.'
The announcement was welcomed by the companies, which had argued that
competition between them had intensified recently due to heavy investment in
research and production equipment to expand and modernise their product
ranges.
The OFT yesterday accepted undertakings from Anthony Green &amp; Co and Lavery
Rowe, its advertising agency, that they would stop publishing misleading
advertisements for depilatory products.
The action followed a complaint by the Advertising Standards Authority,
which had sought unsuccessfully to get the companies to drop from their
advertisements claims that the products retarded the re-growth of hair.
The OFT said it would consider court action against advertisers making
misleading claims.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Train damaged in IRA explosion
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EXPLOSION near a railway track in north London yesterday afternoon
damaged a passing train with flying debris but caused no injury.
Scotland Yard said anti-terrorist officers went to the scene at Silver
Street station, close to the North Circular road.
An hour before the explosion, which happened at about 4.40pm, the IRA in
Dublin issued a statement saying British police had ignored warnings that a
bomb had been left on the rail line in London.
The statement, made just after 3.30pm, accused British officials of
'recklessness' by taking no action over the warnings, said to have been
given to London radio stations.
At that time, Scotland Yard said they had received no such warnings. Forty
minutes later, just before the explosion, British Transport Police said no
security alerts were under way.
British Rail said it had received no advance warning of the blast and Silver
Street station had not been evacuated before the explosion. It confirmed
that the 16.22pm from Cheshunt to Liverpool Street had been caught by the
blast.
It added 'The train is in situ and stationary, having suffered some damage.
There were no injuries.'

KRAFT General Foods International, part of the Philip Morris group of the

The only remaining obstacle for KGFI to clear is approval by the industry
ministry which is required under foreign ownership laws.
Freia is to become part of KGFI's Jacobs Suchard group and is to be named
Freia Marabou Suchard.
Hershey Foods of the US had its Dollars 1.3bn bid rejected by Freia's main

yet to deliver a rival bid for the company which it earlier said it would do
jointly with Orkla, the diversified Norwegian group which has main interests

CSX, the US transportation company, yesterday unveiled a 19 per cent advance
in third-quarter net earnings to Dollars 128m, or Dollars 1.25 a share, from
Dollars 108m, or Dollars 1.07, a year ago.
Operating revenue was essentially unchanged at Dollars 2.21bn, while
operating income advanced 9 per cent to Dollars 262m.
The company attributed its improved performance to operating efficiencies
and reductions in the long-term cost base of its transportation units.
Operating income at CSX's rail business rose 14 per cent to Dollars 182m,
although rail loadings slipped 2 per cent in the quarter. The company said
earnings were helped by cost cuts which offset lacklustre rail operating
revenue.
Union Pacific, another US transportation company, saw a 9 per cent rise in
underlying third-quarter earnings, reflecting gains in all four of its
operating companies.
Net income was Dollars 185m, or 91 cents a share. A year earlier, a one-time
after-tax charge of Dollars 575m pushed the company into the red, with a
deficit of Dollars 406m, or Dollars 2.01. Stripping out the charge, the
company earned Dollars 169m, or 84 cents, in the 1991 third quarter.
Operating revenues stood 3 per cent higher at Dollars 1.85bn in the 1992
quarter against Dollars 1.74bn the previous year.

COMINCO, the Canadian base metals and fertiliser producer, returned to the
black in the third quarter, thanks to higher zinc and copper prices and
improved costs at its smelter at Trail, British Columbia.
But a company official noted the slump in zinc and nickel prices since
end-September was likely to hit fourth-quarter earnings. But lower prices in
the current quarter may be partially offset by higher sales of concentrate
from the Red Dog and Polaris mines.
Third-quarter earnings were CDollars 10.1m (USDollars 8.1m), or 12 cents a
share, before extraordinary items, compared with a loss of CDollars 23.2 ,
or 30 cents, a year earlier. The latest figures exclude an after-tax
investment gain of CDollars 41.7m, stemming mainly from the sale of a 46.3
per cent stake in Aberfoyle, the Australian group.
Revenues rose to CDollars 357m from CDollars 304.8m.

INGERSOLL-RAND, the US industrial and construction equipment manufacturer,

Operating profits, excluding a Dollars 10m charge for the restructuring of
the company's recession-hit aerospace bearings business, slipped by Dollars
5.2m to Dollars 57.5m. Sales rose from Dollars 866m to Dollars 904m.
Net earnings for the first nine months were Dollars 100.8m, or 97 cents a

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS between Israeli, Syrian and Palestinian negotiators resumed in
Washington yesterday, amid rising concern that time might be running out for
the year-old Middle East peace process.
Israel presented a new paper in its talks with Syria, re-formulating what
its negotiators called the 'eternal trinity of peace, security and
territory'.
It was unclear, however, whether the new Israel proposal would meet the
Syrian demand for 'total withdrawal' from occupied Arab lands, including the
Golan Heights taken from Syria in 1967.
Israeli officials would not go into the details of their proposals but
indicated they understood that a full peace settlement, including mutual
recognition and provisions for maintaining secure borders, would have to
include a territorial element.
The seventh round of talks has been clouded by doubts over the re-election
of US President George Bush, whose chief of staff, Mr James Baker, launched
the Middle East peace process. Some Arab delegates, in particular, have
speculated whether Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential
candidate, would be as committed to the process.
Also, Palestinian negotiators have warned that their credibility as
spokesmen for their people is running out. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, Israeli prime
minister, is similarly under pressure to produce results.
The US election being less than two weeks away, however, few observers
expect an immediate breakthrough in either the Israeli-Syrian or the
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations.

99bn barrels if oil is sold at Dollars 20 a barrel to 204bn barrels if the
price is Dollars 27. The estimates assume the use of existing technology.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Heseltine retreats again over coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRESH CONCESSIONS to head off the revolt by Tory MPs over coal closures were
made yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine - including offering a slight hope
that the 10 pits excluded from the moratorium announced this week could yet
be reprieved.
The trade and industry secretary agreed the planned review of the coal
industry should cover subsidies for nuclear power. He also said the impact
of legislation introduced by the government affecting the markets for the
coal and electricity generation industries would be covered.
Mr Heseltine's concessions - aimed at addressing the specific concerns of
possibly rebellious Conservative MPs - came after three tortuous days of
retreat in which he conceded first a delay and then a full review of the
closure programme. The case for closure will now be scrutinised separately
for all pits.
In spite of a bravura performance during a stormy Commons debate, Mr
Heseltine's political reputation, and Conservative MPs' faith in the
sure-footedness of Mr John Major, have been damaged by the back-tracking.
Government whips and ministers worked furiously to minimise the number of
dissidents in last night's vote.
The all-party Trade and Industry Committee meets today to decide the scope
of its inquiry into the future of the coal industry and will call Mr
Heseltine to give evidence next week.
Speaking in a Labour-initiated debate, Mr Heseltine said the review by his
department would be wide-ranging and consider evidence from all interested
parties, including the trade unions. Apart from evidence given in commercial
confidence, as much as possible would be made public.
The inquiry would be 'without restrictions' and have 'no pre-ordained
outcome'. Boyds, a specialist mining consultancy firm, would be employed to
give evidence on the viability of pits and the prospects for British Coal.
Out of the 31 pits originally listed for closure by British Coal, 21 have
been reprieved until at least the new year, pending the review. But Mr
Heseltine was pressed by Labour MPs and rebel Tories on the status of the
other 10, which British Coal has advised have no prospect of being
economically viable and are due to be shut down after a statutory 90 day
consultation period.
He said British Coal was compelled, during the consultations, not to take
any action which might prejudice the possibility of the pits continuing in
operation afterwards, 'and that means they have to indulge in the
appropriate care and maintenance in order to keep open that option'.
But he sought not to raise expectations, emphasising that British Coal had
advised him the 10 pits were lossmaking, and there was 'no case' for waiting
until the end of the general moratorium before beginning the statutory
consultation period.
Mr Heseltine shrugged off jibes by Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and
industry spokesman, directed at the extent of the government's concessions.
He said there would be a white paper next year setting out the result of the
inquiries, the government's energy policy, the consequences for British
Coal, the implications for individual pits and employment prospects in the
industry.
Mr Cook said Labour objected to the government's review because it only
covered the 21 pits included in the moratorium and would be carried out by
the government. He said the government had no energy strategy.

<TEXT>
WESTERN embassies in Belgrade yesterday accused Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic of failing to condemn ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and that warned
UN sanctions will not be lifted until the violence in Bosnia stops.
A statement sent jointly by the EC, the US, and the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), accused Mr Milosevic of not using his
influence to press Bosnian Serb forces into stopping ethnic cleansing or
atrocities in Bosnia.
It criticised Mr Milosevic for failing to publicly diassociate himself from
ethnic cleansing.
'The governments are appalled at the continuing evidence of human rights
abuses and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' it added. The letter
named Bosnian Serb forces, who control 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, as
the 'principal offenders'.
It warned Mr Milosevic to heed the UN Security Council resolution on war
crimes of October 6.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Major's popularity ratings low
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE fiercely hostile reaction to the government's pit closure plan and
deepening public concern over the economy have had a devastating impact on
Mr John Major's popularity ratings, according to a new opinion poll, Ivo
Dawnay writes.
The Mori survey, published in The European today, found 77 per cent
dissatisfied with the prime minister and only 16 per cent expressing
confidence in his leadership - the lowest rating ever recorded for a British
head of government.
At her lowest level in March 1990, Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher recorded
a 20 per cent satisfaction rating.
The findings, taken from a sample of 1,082 drawn from across Britain, said
some 46 per cent of those questioned wanted him to resign, a 17-point rise
over the past three weeks. However, 45 per cent countered that he should
stay at his post.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Heseltine shores up Tory ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE threatened rebellion by Tory backbenchers over the government's
pit-closure proposals was largely defused by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, in the Commons last night.
He said the promised wide-ranging review of the issue would ensure that
British Coal was not being deprived of its fair share of the energy market
through preferential treatment accorded to nuclear power and the privatised
electricity companies.
Mr Heseltine rounded off a skilful mix of placatory words and gestures for
the doubters on the Tory benches with the assurance that there would be a
genuine review with 'no pre-ordained outcome'.
Tension on the government front bench eased as the rowdy and disorderly
barracking to which Mr Heseltine was subjected by Labour MPs brought him an
unexpected political dividend. To cheers from many Tories, Mr Michael
Carttiss, MP for Great Yarmouth, and one of the Tory waverers, declared:
'Labour MPs have ensured that Mr Heseltine has my total support.'
The extent of the further gyrations undertaken by the cabinet to head off
the possibility of an embarrassing defeat at the end of the debate was
underlined when Mr Heseltine made clear that the fate of the 10 worst
loss-making pits, previously scheduled for closure, had not been finally
sealed.
Mr Nicholas Winterton (C Macclesfield), who had earlier said he would vote
against the government, pressed for an undertaking that the review would
cover the privatised electricity companies and result in legislation to
remedy any 'flaws'. Mr Heseltine replied that there would be no point in the
review 'if I was not prepared to consider that option'.
The genuineness of the review was strongly challenged by Mr Robin Cook,
shadow trade and industry secretary, and other opposition MPs. To a roar of
approval from the Labour benches, he called for the threat of the axe to be
removed from all 31 pits, and a frank admission from Mr Heseltine that in
making his original proposal he had got it wrong.
Mr Cook declared: 'We will mobilise the deep public anger you have aroused
until you do admit you were wrong, and until you do admit that the British
economy needs the British coals industry.'
Mr Cook claimed that the government had been forced to climb down over its
pit closure programme by a nation united in anger at the proposed
destruction of mining communities. While earlier pit closures had reflected
the decline in demand for coal in homes, the government had caused the
present crisis by proposing that there should be a reduction in the amount
of coal burnt to produce electricity.
Mr Cook protested that at a time when the country was looking for action to
expand the economy, the government had initiated a closure policy that would
result in 30,000 miners being added to the dole queue. He calculated that
the impact on other industries would result in the total addition to the
number unemployed being around 100,000.
Mr Cook contrasted Britain's position five years ago when it was
self-sufficient in energy with a forecast that by 2020 it would be importing
75 per cent of its primary energy needs. He asked: 'What other country in
Europe would be daft enough to make itself dependent on imported energy when
it is sitting on hundreds of years of coal reserves?'
Mr Patrick Cormack, Conservative MP for Staffordshire South, emphasised the
significance of the the expanded review by telling Mr Heseltine 'it is for
that reason and that reason alone' that many Tory backbenchers would vote in
the government lobby at the end of the debate. In an ominous rider, he noted
that if the review proved to be of a different character the Tory critics
would have an opportunity to vote against the government on a subsequent
occasion.
Mr Heseltine replied: 'I can only say that that thought had occurred to me.'
Mr Michael Clark, former Tory chairman of the energy select committee, said
he could not vote for the government amendment 'as things stand at the
moment' and asserted that the government had 'misread the mood of the people
in this country'.
If the government wanted his support, he said, it must commit itself to 'an
open, public and published' review, explain its energy policy and 'keep all
31 pits alive'.
He concluded: 'I shall be voting tonight not against my own government . . .
but for the coal industry.'
Later Mr Heseltine pledged that no miner would be 'disadvantaged' with
regard to redundancy payments as a result of the policy changes announced in
recent days.
Officials interpreted that to mean that redundancy payments at affected pits
would be based on income over the 12 weeks to October 13.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, demanded
that the government implement a moratorium on new gas-fired power stations
until the coal review was completed.
Coal faced a squeeze in the market because it had been put at 'the end of
the queue' in the government's privatisation programme, he suggested.
Mr Kevin Barron, Labour MP for Rother Valley, alleged that the government
review 'has more to do with trying to get (Mr Heseltine) off the hook' than
examining the country's long-term energy needs. 'We can look forward to
eight pits by the end of this decade,' he said.
Mr Michael Alison, Tory MP for Selby, said that with foreign coal costing
Pounds 32 a tonne 'a high-productivity British Coal really could beat all
players'.
Sir Rhodes Boyson, a former minister, demanded that the government should
consider every decision in the light of its impact on employment. 'I don't
want nil inflation if we have nil employment at the same time,' he said.
He welcomed the new commitment to a 'full, total and open review', though he
added that he wished all 31 pits were covered by it.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Quarterlies and bond weakness
hit Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
DISAPPOINTING corporate earnings and a stalled bond market rally trimmed
early gains on US markets yesterday to leave share prices virtually
unchanged at the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended up 1.08 at 3,187.10, well below its
early highs when the index approached 3,200. The more broadly based Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 also closed slightly firmer, up 0.19 at 415.67, while the Amex
composite rose 2.02 to 373.42 and the Nasdaq maintained its recently strong
performance with a gain of 4.45 at 597.15. Turnover on the NYSE was 217m
shares, and declines outpaced rises by 907 to 828.
Prices opened firmer, buoyed by hopes in Europe that the Bundesbank will cut
German interest rates soon, allowing other countries to reduce domestic
rates. The market was also boosted by an early rise in bond prices, which
have been hard hit lately by concern that if Mr Bill Clinton wins the
presidential election he would adopt an expansionary fiscal policy that
could reignite inflation and widen the deficit.
Bond prices, however, were unable to hold on to their gains, a weakness
which was quickly transferred to equities. Although bonds later recovered,
stocks remained troubled by some disappointing third quarter earnings
reports from major US companies.
Among the worst performing individual stocks, United Technologies fell
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 45 1/2 in turnover of 1.7m shares after the company
reported a quarterly profit of 95 cents a share, up from 90 cents a share a
year ago but below analysts' forecasts.
Another disappointment was Conner Peripherals, which fell Dollars 2 1/4 to
Dollars 18 3/4 in turnover of 2.7m shares in spite of reporting a big rise
in profits to Dollars 41.9m. The earnings failed to meet market
expectations.
Schlumberger dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 68 after the oil and electronics
group announced third quarter net income of Dollars 172.7m, down from
Dollars 196.2m a year earlier, and said that it remained cautious about near
term earnings because of worldwide economic conditions and low business
confidence.
Chrysler rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 26 1/4 in turnover of 2m shares in the
wake of good earnings figures earlier in the week. The stock also received a
boost from broking house Warburg Securities, which raised its earnings
estimates for the car group. Ford and General Motors, which have yet to
report their earnings, rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 38 5/8 and Dollars 1 to
Dollars 30 7/8 respectively.
On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications firmed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 35
7/8 after reporting third quarter profits of Dollars 154m, up from Dollars
133m at the same stage last year.
Canada
TORONTO share prices ended higher for the fifth consecutive session. The TSE
300 composite index climbed 10.79 points, or 0.33 per cent, to 3,252.63.
Advancing issues led declines 288 to 234. Volume was 25.7m shares worth
CDollars 252.1m compared with the previous 30.7m shares worth CDollars
283.2m.
The transportation sector jumped 3.02 per cent on index, boosted by Laidlaw
B shares, and the industrial products sector gained 1 per cent on index.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Senior bourses break three-day
uptrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurotrack 100 broke a three-day uptrend yesterday, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Tuesday's accelerated gains followed an indication from the Bundesbank of
lower interest rates at yesterday's securities repurchase tender; but a cut
of 15 basis points in the lowest interest rate involved, to 8.75 per cent,
disappointed market hopes for a drop of 40 or 50 points.
FRANKFURT reacted with a 7.65 fall in the DAX index to 1,503.90. German
market turnover fell from DM7.2bn to DM6.3bn. A domestic strategist, Mr
Horst-Kaspar Greven of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf, said that the
disappointment lay with London traders who had expected too much, too soon
from the Bundesbank.
Merck Finck is inclined to underplay the interest rate issue, saying that an
impressive bond market rally is being outweighed by the dramatic
deterioration in the outlook for German corporate earnings.
It sees a downside DAX risk of 1,300 to 1,320. Meanwhile, nine-month figures
are due, and sensitive nerves are being stretched by a succession of
earnings downgrades: Volkswagen, subject to its latest in a series this
week, fell another DM6.80 to DM264.70.
In trucks and engineering, MAN fell DM5.50 to DM210.50; and in steels, after
a succession of bad news stories recently, Mannesmann, Preussag and Thyssen
fell by DM5.50 to DM210.50, DM9.80 to DM311.20, and DM4.80 to DM311.20.
PARIS opened just under 1 per cent higher, boosted by a strong Matif and
continued hopes of an early cut in interest rates. But profit-taking after
Tuesday's gains quickly set in and sent the CAC-40 index down to the day's
low of 1,712.07. It finally closed 9.02 lower at 1,722.24 as turnover
dropped back to FFr2.44bn.
Dealers said that many company presentations at a large meeting of
institutional investors had indicated that second half performance this year
would not match up to that in 1991.
Thomson-CSF dropped FFr5.10, or 4.5 per cent to FFr109 after the defence
company reported a 25 per cent decline in its first-half net and said that
it expects a full year decline. Lafarge featured on the upside, adding FFr13
or 4.6 per cent to FFr296. Dealers attributed the rise to the stronger
dollar.
MILAN ended lower as Credito Italiano slumped 11 per cent on reports that
the bank's privatisation was not likely to benefit minority shareholders.
The Comit index fell 7.43 or 1.8 per cent to 408.68 in turnover estimated at
around Tuesday's L172bn.
Credito Italiano plunged L250 to L2,025 as investors sold out. The food
company, Sme, another privatisation stock which has gained sharply this
week, fell 4.1 per cent or L178 to L4,200.
AMSTERDAM turned negative on interest rates in the afternoon, the CBS
Tendency index closing down 0.2 at 105.3 after an intraday high of 106.4.
Heineken was one of the main losers, down Fl 2.70 at Fl 169.90 on
profit-taking after the stock's recent strong performance.
Chemicals were notable winners on the day, with DSM and Akzo ahead Fl 1.00
and 50 cents respectively at Fl 88.50 and Fl 131.30. Elsevier, up Fl 1.80 at
Fl 108.20, was another blue chip beat the trend, helped by a good
performance by Reed of the UK, with which it is holding merger talks.
ZURICH fell on profit-taking, the SMI index closing 15.1 lower at 1,907.5
and a fall in the dollar putting pressure on dollar-sensitive multinationals
like Ciba-Geigy and Roche.
Investors switched into insurance from banking, Zurich putting on SFr55 to
SFr1,955 and Winterthur SFr60 to SFr2,750. Ciba-Geigy dropped SFr9 to
SFr625, Roche SFr20 to SFr3,600, and Ascom SFr40 to SFr1,370 as the telecoms
company said that profits will be lower in 1992.
MADRID followed the general trend of thinking, the general index losing 1.42
to 198.67 in moderate turnover of Pta12.50bn. Banco Santander, which
reported third quarter figures in line with expectations, gained Pta5 to
Pta3,820.
STOCKHOLM continued to rally in moderate trading as falling interest rates
and a stronger dollar supported the market. The Affarsvarlden General Index
rose 8.0 to 692.2 as turnover declined to SKr466m from SKr503m.
HELSINKI majored on its own fall in interest rates, which left the Hex index
up 19.1 or 3 per cent at 661.8 for a two-day gain of 5.6 per cent.
VIENNA was positive on the news elsewhere in Europe and the ATX index firmed
19.67 to 800.31.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: China trade hopes drive Hong Kong to
new peak - The colony's outstanding success against other international
equity markets in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After a summer lull, Hong Kong has reasserted itself as the best performing
major stock market in the world this year. Investors have reacted with
enthusiasm as the colony has slid off the hook of another US/China trade
dispute, and the upsurge looks set to continue.
The Hang Seng index finished May at 6,080.15, up 41 per cent over the first
five months of 1992. After that it was volatile, peaking at 6,162.53 in July
but retreating to 5,291.49 by August 25.
The index has recovered this month, anticipating, then celebrating a Sino/US
trade agreement which has smoothed China's path towards membership of GATT.
This should ensure enormous trade flows through Hong Kong, and has more than
made up for any perceived China-baiting by the colony's new governor.
After a 6.9 per cent rise last week, the market has continued to climb. Late
buying yesterday drove turnover up from HKDollars 3.45bn to HKDollars 4.19bn
(Dollars 544m), and took the Hang Seng up another 112.34 to a new record
high of 6,200.85 amid rumours that mainland Chinese money was coming in to
support the action.
It has been a case of economics getting the better of politics. On the
political front, there is uncertainty in Mr Chris Patten's aggressively open
policy on the airport talks with China and his push for further democracy
within the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution after 1997. These will
result in a tense few days during his first visit to Beijing.
Further afield, the US elections will inevitably cast their shadow on Hong
Kong, both because of the impact they could have on interest rates and on
the local currency (the Hong Kong dollar is pegged to the US dollar), and
because of their potential impact on trade relations between China and the
US.
But last week, international institutions decided that with China becoming a
more positive theme and the colony's economic growth trend appearing
assured, they had had enough of waiting.
Even by Hong Kong standards, a 388-point climb in the Hang Seng Index in
just one week is a major vote of confidence; and the outlook remains
extremely positive.
Uncertainty about the performance of Mr Patten in Beijing has encouraged
some profit-taking, but if one ultimately believes that Hong Kong's airport
will be built (and few realistically dispute this), then the stock market
looks to be winding up for its Chinese New Year bull run.
Most analysts are anticipating more than 20 per cent corporate earnings
growth in the current year, followed up by a similar level in 1993. If the
market were to rise to an internationally modest 1993 price-earnings ratio
of 13 from its current 1993 p/e of around 10.9, this would leave the Hang
Seng Index at more than 7,500.
At present there is a wave of foreign capital which is supporting this
upward push, aided by a shortage of alternatives amongst the lacklustre
global stock markets.
SG Warburg Securities estimates that the Hong Kong market will raise
HKDollars 57bn from new equity in 1992, up 60 per cent from 1991. But with
HKDollars 48bn in dividend income and an estimated HKDollars 54bn inflow of
foreign institutional capital, the stock market is riding on a wave of
liquidity.
In addition, Hong Kong investors are still faced with negative interest
rates (inflation has fallen to 9 per cent, but the prime rate is 6.5 per
cent) and a soft residential property market, which leave few alternative
havens for capital.
Many analysts argue that Hong Kong should return to a p/e rating compatible
with other Asian markets now that the force of China's economic
transformation is clear and Deng Xiaoping's great reform programme is
finally written in stone, after last week's 14th Party Congress.
'We are now seeing a continuation of the structural re-rating that began
earlier this year, now that several concerns have been lifted. This market
has a long way to go,' says Mr Sheldon Kasowitz, research manager at Jardine
Fleming Securities.
The longer-term concerns are a US-induced reversal of the interest rate
trend and a heavy-handed reaction to the red-hot Chinese economy; but in the
meantime, the bulls are definitely back.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Talk of discount rate
cut lifts Tokyo stocks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The Nikkei average closed above the 17,000 level on late investment trust
buying after a call by Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, for lower
money market rates spurred hopes of a cut in the official discount rate,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index advanced 153.86 to close at the day's high of 17,141.52, having
fallen to the day's low of 16,839.69 earlier in the afternoon.
Volume fell to 170m shares from 192m as advances led declines by 520 to 342
with 201 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 7.46 to 1,298.33 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.03 to
1045.94.
Weak money supply figures, which registered a 0.4 per cent decline in
September, also added to hopes of lower rates. However, activity
concentrated on index-linked buying by investment trusts and overall trading
remained dull.
Interest rate-sensitive issues were heavily traded, with Sumitomo Metal
Industries, the most active issue of the day, rising Y8 to Y270. Nippon
Steel, however, fell Y1 to Y292 on profit taking.
Export-oriented, high-technology stocks were higher as the dollar
strengthened against the yen: Hitachi jumped Y14 to Y737 and NEC advanced Y9
to Y695.
Financials were stronger on hopes of better earnings due to lower interest
rates. Industrial Bank of Japan rose Y10 to Y2,440 and Mitsubishi Bank
gained Y50 to Y2,120.
Inabata, the chemical and pharmaceutical trading company, rose Y50 to Y1,170
on foreign buying. Inabata holds a stake in the unlisted Sumitomo
Pharmaceutical, which is a market leader in Interferon.
Clarion, the car audio maker, fell Y44 to Y455 on a downward revision of its
earnings estimates. Clarion is now forecasting a Y8.5bn after-tax loss for
the current year to next March.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 65.40 to 18,726.96 in volume of 8.8m
shares.
Roundup
TOKYO's recovery helped to lift some of the region's markets yesterday.
SEOUL rose for the fourth consecutive session, helped by lower interest
rates, as the composite index ended 19.26 higher at 559.71 in turnover of
Won431.9bn after Tuesday's Won245.1bn.
Manufacturing groups were boosted by government plans to provide substantial
funds for capital investment. Daewoo Heavy Industries gained Won400 to
Won9,510 and Hyundai Motor was up Won800 at Won21,700.
TAIWAN, which fell sharply at the opening on reports of a drop in third
quarter GNP, recouped some ground in late trading on bargain-hunting in blue
chips.
The weighted index closed 29.79 lower at 3,694.38 in low turnover of
TDollars 11.5bn.
MANILA recovered after Tuesday's losses but investor confidence remained
weak because of lengthy daily power cuts in the capital. The composite index
advanced 9.45 to 1,353.86.
AUSTRALIA continued to improve with the exception of the gold sector, which
saw further sharp falls in joint owners of the Porgera gold mine. The All
Ordinaries index put on 17 to 1,443.9 in turnover of ADollars 260.52m.
In the mining sector, Placer Pacific lost 12 cents to ADollars 1.74,
Highlands Gold slipped 2 cents to 84 cents and Renison fell 4 cents to
ADollars 3.46.
Among financials, ANZ put on 8 cents to ADollars 2.62, Westpac added 2 cents
to ADollars 2.82, National Australia gained 1 cent to ADollars 7.15 and the
Commonwealth Bank gained 4 cents to ADollars 5.96.
NEW ZEALAND was active in second- and third-line stocks as the NZSE-40 index
rose 6.48 to 1,373.32 in turnover of Dollars 24.5m. Among major issues,
Telecom rose 6 cents to NZDollars 2.30.
KUALA LUMPUR recovered from early losses and the composite index closed up
0.89 at 615.85, having earlier touched a low of 613. Brokers commented that
sentiment remained nervous ahead of next week's budget announcement.
BANGKOK saw active trading in the banking sector and the SET index gained
5.25 to 883.93 in turnover of Bt11.26bn. Advances led declines 134 to 87
with 69 shares unchanged. Krung Thai Bank rose Bt12 to Bt228.
BOMBAY's flood of rights issues took 3.8 per cent off the BSE index, which
fell 116.24 to 2,934.66 on the penultimate day of trading for the current
Hindu year.
Analysts said that companies were raising an estimated Rs85bn through the
equity market over the next three months.
KARACHI saw institutional and overseas buying interest, the latter mainly
from Pakistanis abroad, as the KSE 100 index gained 11.58 to 1,237.89.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Survey of Leman Region (5): Serious economic problem - The
Wine Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AGRICULTURE and food industries are among the most important contributors to
the economy of the Leman region.
In the French deparment of Ain, the 250 companies in the sector have
combined sales of FFr11bn and employ 4.2 per cent of the workforce. In the
Swiss canton of Vaud, home to Nestle, the world's largest foods group,
10,000 people work in agriculture and food industries.
Cheeses are the most important agricultural products of the region, with
output concentrated mainly in Haute Savoie, famous for its reblochon, and in
Vaud, the source of gruyere.
The region is also known for its mineral waters, especially Evian which
bubbles up from a spring on the south shore of Lac Leman, and for chocolate.
Oddly, of the 15 Swiss companies that make chocolate, only Nestle is based
in the Leman region.
The region's second-largest agricultural product is wine - and it is also
the one that these days is the most troubled, at least on the Swiss side.
It is distressing to think that an area as beautiful as the steep north
slopes rising from Lac Leman between Lausanne and Vevey could be the source
of a serious economic problem. But groves of grapes basking in the warm
autumn sun have helped to create Switzerland's very own wine lake and early
reports of another excellent harvest this year indicate that things are
going to get worse before they get better.
The Leman region is Switzerland's main wine-producing area, responsible for
about 80 per cent of national output. Most of it is in the form of white
wines made from the Chasselas grape that are pleasant but not memorable.
Until recently, viticulture has been a remarkably successful business in
Switzerland - indeed, it is the only sector of Swiss agriculture that has
been consistently profitable.
This success was no great tribute to the growers. They have benefited from
an extraordinarily high level of protection from foreign competition,
enabling them to sell virtually all of their output on the domestic market
at unrealistically high prices.
Domestic wines accounted for 45 per cent of consumption last year.
With a captive home market, growers have spent little effort trying to build
up exports or an international reputation. Exports are a pathetic 1 per cent
of output; less than 2m bottles a year.
However, change is in the wind. At the beginning of this year, the
government lifted quotas on bulk red wine imports and, in the context of the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations, is likely to lift all
remaining quotas by 1995.
The government has also imposed yield restrictions on growers for the first
time, in an attempt to prevent further substantial additions to existing
surpluses.
The source of the industry's troubles was a period of shortages in the late
1970s which led to very high prices. Many growers responded by expanding
production in the early 1980s. This led inevitably to excessive yields in
good years, the latest instance being in 1989 when some 170m litres were
produced, 27 per cent more than normal annual consumption.
As of last June 30, stocks of white wine - which accounts for about 60 per
cent of total production - stood at 105m litres. And this year's output will
probably add another 80m litres to the lake.
All this is made worse by the fact that domestic consumption is falling.
Last year, the Swiss drank 303.8m litres of wine, 4.25 per cent less than in
1990 and the lowest level in a decade. Demand for domestic wines fell less
than for imported ones, but only as a result of severe price cutting.
The growers are attracting little sympathy among the Swiss public.
Comfortable in their protected market for a long time, they made little
effort to boost the quality or prestige of their products, even though
consumers were becoming more discriminating. The first AOC (controlled
origin label) Swiss wines date from only five years ago.
Several growers have already given up, others are in deep trouble. Cave de
Geneve, one of the largest co-operatives with 244 grower-members, has been
unable to pay its members for their crops as a result of the slump in prices
this summer, and is straining with a stock of 5m litres and debts of SFr40m.
Ironically, Vin-Union-Geneve, the federation of Geneva growers, was among
the first to recognise that the market was changing. They have urged members
to shift their emphasis in the past few years from quantity to quality.
Last month, the Federations Romande des Vignerons called for help from the
federal government to get rid of the surpluses.
The government has a 'fonds viticole' to which growers contribute for
providing emergency aid to the industry, but officials say any action would
have to be approved by parliament and could not be taken until next summer.
Opposition from the big German-speaking cantons for more aid for the Romandy
vineyards is likely to be substantial.
'It will be very difficult,' an official in the federal agriculture office
predicts.
Even if aid is agreed, it is not clear what would be done with the
surpluses. Some suggest distilling it, others would use it for food
processing. The simplest method would be to pour it down the drain, but
industry leaders agree that would be a marketing disaster.
Another problem is that growers who have voluntarily limited their
production in recent years are not too happy about the idea of emergency
fund money going to those who have produced too much.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELKEM, THE Norwegian light metals producer, yesterday announced a
50,000-tonne cut in domestic ferro-silicon and ferrochrome production, which
would also lead to a reduction in its workforce.
The move comes as a result of a further deterioration in Elkem's main
markets, which Mr Ole Enger, the president, blamed on exports from eastern
Europe and China.
Elkem's annual domestic production capacity of ferro-silicon is 260,000
tonnes. Its worldwide capacity, which is at present 75 per cent utilised, is
450,000 tonnes.
Production at the group's lone ferrochrome plant, which is situated at Rana
in Norway and has annual production capacity of 140,000 tonnes, would be cut
by 26,000 tonnes, Elkem said. A 24,000-tonne cut would be made at the
Bjoelvefossen and Salten ferro-silicon plants.
'These actions show how serious the situation in our markets is,' Mr Enger
said. 'It is crucial that the power-intensive industries in Norway obtain
conditions that are as good as, or at least no worse than, other producers.'

FT  22 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ dairymen set to cream off
profits - The industry is brimming with optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Zealand dairy industry is brimming with optimism three months into
its new season. Mr Dryden Spring, chairman of the Dairy Board, forecast this
week that the industry would earn NZDollars 3.5bn (Pounds 1.16bn) in
1992-93, NZDollars 500m more than in the 1991-92 year.
Increasing optimism is seeing a sharp rise in the price of both dairy cattle
and farms. Dairy farmers are expecting a payout of about NZDollars 6 a
kilogram of milk fat this season - 50 cents more than Mr Spring told farmers
to expect when the 1991-92 season ended in June.
This is stirring stuff for an industry which began the 1991-92 season from a
low base and was thrilled to end it with a higher than expected pay out of
NZDollars 5.20 a kilogram. Total payments to farmers were higher, having
been topped up by individual dairy companies.
Judging by past experience the October pay out is likely to be a
conservative one, and the board will closely monitor the season with further
reviews probable in February and at the end of the season. The board will
not be drawn on how much extra may be paid.
Industry executives say, however, that while the future is not guaranteed,
most farmers are counting on an average pay out of about NZDollars 6 a
kilogram. The average farmer producing 25,000 kg of milk fat a year expects
to see his income rise by some NZDollars 25,000 over last season's.
Mr Spring said that he expected earnings this season would be almost double
the depressed 1988 figure, underlining the industry's continuing success in
adding value to its raw product. Export volumes have risen by only 12 per
cent in that time.
Most dairy farmers had not recovered from the spending cuts forced by
falling prices of two season's ago, the chairman said, and he expected that
the extra income would be spent on maintenance and fertiliser. Two factors
had stopped the board's forecasts being even better: an increase in European
Community export subsidies, which was expected to bring lower prices, and
the continuing absence of Russia from the dairy market.
Increases in world dairy prices generally and greater sales to the growing
markets of Asia and Latin America were the main reason for the increasing
optimism, Mr Spring said. Though world prices had slipped from the peaks of
two to three months ago, they were still well ahead of last year for most
products except butter.
Skim milk powder is selling for USDollars 1,990 a tonne, compared with
USDollars 1,550 last season. Butter is down from USDollars 1,500 to
USDollars 1,440. Mr Spring said trade liberalisation was the main reason for
increased sales to Latin America. Up to 1981 sales were mainly in bulk going
to government buying agencies, but privatisation had opened the way for
value added products. Branded dairy consumer products in Latin America had
risen in value from NZDollars 30m to an estimated NZDollars 140m this year.
Latin America was now New Zealand's biggest market in volume, though it
trailed Europe in earnings. He said the Asian dairy market was growing at 5
per cent a year.
The board reports that in the 1991 year returns for most dairy products
rose, with cheese up 15 per cent and milk powder and casein up by more than
33 per cent. Butter returns were also somewhat higher.
It says it is difficult to forecast butter prices as this depends on future
purchases from the former Soviet Union, a key market.
No worthwhile payments have been received from the NZDollars 270m debt from
last season, and this is causing some concern within the board. While it is
known that the Russians want more butter, the board is unlikely to provide
it till some progress is made on paying what is already owed. Some
settlement is expected, however, as recent loans from the West should give
the former Soviet Union money to spend, and there has been progress on money
owed for wool, leading to a resumption of that trade.
The board says the skim milk powder market looks better. Over the last month
the EC has cut its export subsidies, leading to a rise in prices. EC
consumption of milk, and conversion to cheese and butter, has picked up
sharply in the current season, and this is also seen as a positive in
cutting the community's export capacity.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Nervousness distorts new
aluminium contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   A PREMIUM for nearby metal over metal for forward delivery
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
known as a backwardation - has developed in the London Metal Exchange's new
aluminium alloy contract because of market nervousness over the fact that
there is no metal yet in LME warehouses, an LME seminar was told in London
yesterday.
Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, chairman of the LME aluminium alloy committee, said the
backwardation (Dollars 15 a tonne between January 6 and 20) reflected the
lack of cash trading in the contract, which does not begin until January 6.
He did not expect the backwardation to last much beyond then.
The aluminium alloy contract, launched on October 6, is trading about 600
tonnes a day, with open interest at 13,740 tonnes. 'I consider this
extremely healthy,' said Mr Kestenbaum, who believes that trading volume
will increase once cash trading begins. But he said it would be four or five
years before the contract could be considered mature.
He did not doubt that it would be successful, pointing out that the amount
of aluminium scrap produced in the US alone was set to rise from the present
2.7m tonnes to 3.6m tonnes by the turn of the century. 'For much of this
tonnage the primary aluminium contract is a rotten hedge,' he said, but the
industry could make increasing use of the aluminium alloy contract.
'This particular industry is in its infancy and that is why this was the
right moment to introduce this contract,' Mr Kestenbaum told the seminar.
Western nickel stocks, at about 16 weeks consumption, are not substantial,
Mr Vivian Davies of Brandeis (Brokers) told the seminar. Producer stocks are
between 110,000 and 115,000 tonnes and merchant stocks at 30,000 tonnes. LME
warehouse stocks are a record 53,706 tonnes, much of it from the CIS, which
is expected to export 115,000 tonnes this year, of which 30,000 tonnes will
come through unofficial channels. But, Mr Davies pointed out, in 1975 Inco,
the world's biggest nickel producer, alone had stocks of 165,000 tonnes.
Mr Martin Abbott, LME marketing director, said the surge in options on the
exchange from 5 to 12 per cent of total turnover in the last 18 months was
'entirely logical' in a period of great uncertainty in the market. He denied
that there was anything suspicious about the development.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italy may resort to decree on
milk quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government is prepared to resort to the use of a decree in order
to have legislation on milk quotas ready for the next meeting of European
Community agriculture ministers, which is scheduled to be held on October
26.
The law is designed to bring Italian milk production policy into line with
the community's and is an essential part of the government's strategy to try
to persuade the EC to think again about the size of the reduction demanded
in Italy's milk quota.
Italy has been given an annual quota of 9m tonnes of milk, compared with its
present production of 11.5m tonnes. This quota has sparked strong protests
from the producers, who claim they are being asked to make an unacceptably
large cut. The government for its part has responded by trying to seek a
better deal, which would raise the quota by 10 per cent.
However, the government is well aware that its community partners have been
antagonised by the behaviour of previous Italian administrations, which
consistently denied that the industry was over-producing and concealing the
true extent of production. As a result the new law on milk quotas has been
drawn up to forestall further criticism from the EC and bring Italy into
line.
The law fixes individual quotas for producers and proposes a three year
period, 1992 to 1994, over which Italy would reduce production.
This legislation risks being held up in parliament because of the need to
give early approval for the 1993 budget. Resort to a decree will also get
round some of the amendments the milk lobby is seeking to make in the
chamber of deputies.
With the new law in hand, the government hopes to demonstrate Italy's good
intentions to comply with the quota scheme - at one stage the Italians were
threatening simply to ignore the quotas.
The government next week will also repeat its argument for a raising of the
quota level, pointing out the country's high level of milk imports - about
9m tonnes. Italian officials hope the matter can be resolved by the end of
November.

BASE METALS continued to be underpinned by a short-term corrective reaction
following recent hefty price declines on the London Metal Exchange
yesterday. But the general fundamental picture of sluggish economies and
high stocks suggests the downside will be revisited soon, dealers said. The
markets are also pausing this week with many participants and traders
side-lined for LME dinner week. London COCOA futures made strong advances,
but ended with gains slightly pared. Dealers said the upward movement
carried on from Tuesday's key chart reversal in New York, which had prompted
an active short covering rally. In Chicago MAIZE continued to trade lower at
midsession, with the market focusing on the large crop and ignoring rumours
Ukraine has purchased 300,000 tonnes of corn, traders said. 'The modest
rally yesterday on the Russian purchase (of 820,000 tonnes of US corn)
proved this market is heading lower on the huge crop,' one trader said.

'green' onslaught
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINING industry's environmental performance was under increasingly
intense scrutiny following the Rio Earth Summit, Mr George Littlewood,
vice-president, external affairs, for CRA, the Australian natural resources
group warned yesterday. 'The world has changed for the mining industry and
we ignore those changes at our economic cost.'
He suggested that the environmental movement had used Rio to enhance its
international networks. A follow-up paper by the Washington-based Worldwatch
Institute think-tank showed a 'shift and intensification in the
environmental movement's interest in the mining industry'.
The Worldwatch paper moved the anti-mining argument one step further by
suggesting the world could not afford the ecological price of satisfying its
present appetite for minerals. It also claimed mining had a big adverse
impact on the environment because it was a profligate user of energy and
therefore contributed to all the adverse aspects of energy use, including
potential climate change.
Mr Littlewood told a conference held as part of the American Mining
Congress's MinExpo exhibition: 'It is the environmental movement - not the
industry - which now has the tools at its disposal to pursue that argument.
The momentum and political sanction created by the Rio summit and public
opinion in sections of the developed world are on its side. Its capacity to
organise and inspire and its record of past success should caution any view
that Rio was the end rather than the beginning of even closer scrutiny of
our industry'.
He called for more support for the International Council for Mining, set up
by some of the big companies two years ago, as a start towards ensuring the
mining industry got its own international networks working better.
The mining industry should balance the debate about ethical issues, he said.
'It is no more ethical for this generation to pass on to succeeding
generations a degraded economy than it is to pass on a degraded
environment.'
Mr Littlewood pointed out: 'Development creates infrastructure, finances
education, enables cultural advancement and allows economic surpluses to be
used to look after the less well off in developed societies. No wonder large
parts of the world, which currently do not enjoy such benefits, become
rightfully irritated when they are told to cease and desist in the pursuit
of economic growth by those who enjoy the benefits of growth.
'Morality is on the side of development as well as on the side of those who
genuinely care for the protection of the environment.'
About 200 delegates from the CIS and other parts of the former eastern bloc
are at the AMC exhibition, looking for mining technology equipment and joint
ventures. The number of exhibitors at MinExpo, which is held every four
years, is a record 880 and attendance, forecast to be about 30,000 before
the show started, is exceeding expectations. Foreign visitors account for
nearly 20 per cent of those attending.

<TEXT>
LONDON ROBUSTA coffee prices touched 8-month highs yesterday and the New
York arabica market was further ahead in late trading in what one trader
described as 'a total turnround in market sentiment'.
'A couple of months ago you would have sold the rallies - now you are
looking to buy the dips,' said the London trader, who added that there was
little selling from countries of origin.
The London market has moved ahead on the back of New York. On Tuesday, the
New York December contract broke through 62.90 cents a lb - regarded as an
important level by technical traders - to close 2.70 cents ahead at 64.85
cents. In late trading yesterday it was almost another cent up. London's
December robusta contract closed up Dollars 20 at Dollars 885 a tonne,
having touched an eight-month high of Dollars 894.
Ms Judy Ganes, softs analyst with Merrill Lynch, said yesterday that the
market's strength had surprised a lot of people, including roasters and
technical traders. Only a few weeks ago coffee prices were at 20-year lows,
with the nearby New York contract below 50 cents a lb.
Most of the movement in New York has been sparked by the smaller crop in
Brazil, the world's biggest producer. Last week Brazil said it had exported
only 1m bags (60 kg each) in September, down from 1.6m bags in September
1991. Domestic prices in Brazil have risen sharply, with the average cost of
a bag of export quality at Dollars 60. This partly reflects the recent
government decision to roll over producer loans.
Ms Ganes sees New York hitting 70 cents in the run up to the next
International Coffee Organisation talks on a new agreement, scheduled for
the end of next month.
These talks are likely to be the key to further price gains. Delegates will
have to make some sort of progress in order to avoid a market reaction, said
a London trader. 'They won't want to let go the ground we have gained under
such difficult circumstances.'

FT  22 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Outlook on wool prices remains
gloomy

<TEXT>
The outlook for wool prices remains gloomy in the short term but is positive
in the long term, according to Mr Pat Morrison, chairman of the New Zealand
Wool Board, reports Reuter from Wellington.
In a speech to Federated Farmers he said he was less confident about the
short term than he was six months ago.
The world market has recovered slightly from the 45-year low of a year ago
but is still at historically low levels.
The only bright spot has been the return of China to the market - last
season it bought more than a fifth of New Zealand's wool exports.
Russia, traditionally the world's biggest wool importer and one of New
Zealand's main customers, wants wool but remains side-lined because of its
inability to pay for it.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Prices in the main primary markets are only just holding steady, after
tending easier for most of the week. The Australian Wool Corporation's
market indicator has fallen to another new low point for this season, at 506
cents a kg. The trade has noted that some woolgrowers withdrew thier wool
from the sale before it started yesterday, in addition to some large
percentages passed in at growers' reserves during the sale. On some previous
occasions a weak market has led to this approach, as dissatisfaction with
selling prices develops.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Short-dated yields suffer from interest
rate cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTUAL and anticipated interest rate cuts across Europe helped short-dated
yields take another lurch downwards yesterday, though a correction began to
be felt in some bond markets after the heady advances of recent days.
The Bundesbank accepted some bids at its latest repurchase agreement tender
at 8.75 per cent, with others at 8.80 per cent, confirming hopes created on
Tuesday that it was about to shift rates lower from the previous 8.90 per
cent fixed rate repo. Although this represented another significant step
down, it left the more optimistic market participants disappointed, helping
to explain the lack of further gains in the bund market yesterday.
Yesterday's news of M3 money supply growth of 9.1 per cent in September  - a
figure distorted by the large-scale intervention by the Bundesbank to
support several European currencies - left the bond market largely unmoved.
Though the figure was lower than some had expected, it was widely seen as
irrelevant.
The Euromark futures contract rose sharply as the market looked for further
reductions in German rates, though it fell back later. Having opened at
91.87, the December contract moved up to 91.93, anticipating interest rates
nearly as low as 8 per cent by the end of the year, before dropping back to
91.79.
The bund futures contract followed a similar pattern on heavy volume, rising
from 91.53 to 91.70 and then slipping back to 91.37
THE Bundesbank's actions helped to provoke a series of interest rate cuts
across the 'core' European markets which were not hit by recent ERM
turbulence.
In a co-ordinated move, Belgium and the Netherlands cut their key money
market rates. Belgium's intervention rate came down by 15 basis points to
8.75 per cent and its discount rate to 7.75 per cent, a fall of a quarter of
a point, while the Netherlands also engineered quarter-point cuts in its key
rates.
French overnight interest rates slipped below 10.5 per cent for the first
time since the currency crisis broke around the French franc. Austria cut
its key interest rates by a quarter of a point, while Sweden's Riksbank
reduced its marginal lending rate to 13.5 per cent from 14.5 per cent.
Encouraged by these moves, investors in most continental European markets
continued to move into shorter-dated paper in anticipation of further German
monetary easing. Against this background, longer-dated bonds weakened later
in the day, giving up some of their recent gains.
CONFIRMATION that the UK is embarking on a course intended to pull it
quickly out of recession gave a further boost to the gilt market yesterday,
leaving investors with the unusual sight of gilts continuing to advance
strongly in tandem with the stock market.
Gilt investors preferred to disregard the potentially inflationary
consequences of a rush for growth, looking instead for further interest rate
cuts. The short sterling futures contract opened up more than a quarter of a
point and rose another 17 basis points to 93.47 in the euphoria, before
slipping to 93.24 by the close.
Stronger-than-expected retail sales and profit taking also hit longer-dated
bonds. Medium-maturity paper jumped as much as a point and a half before
losing ground. This still left the spread between 10-year gilts and bunds
even narrower at around 120 basis points, a level widely considered
unsustainable.
AFTER three days of heavy selling, US Treasury prices were pushed higher by
short-covering, bargain-buying and the announcement of smaller-than-expected
note auctions.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  13/32 at 95
21/32 , yielding 7.614 per cent. The two-year note was also firmer, up  9/32
at 99 9/16 , yielding 4.214 per cent.
Traders said early demand was primarily a technical reaction to recent steep
declines, with speculative players taking advantage of lower prices and
short-sellers buying Treasuries to cover their positions. Prices gained
further ground when the Treasury announced only a slight increase in the
amount of two-year and five-year notes it will auction next week.
The underlying mood of the market remained subdued, with investors nervous
about the fiscal implications of a Democratic presidency. However, analysts
said those concerns may now be priced into bonds.

FT  22 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Dollars 300m Danish offer struggles
against soft US market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDER dollar swap spreads temporarily shifted attention to the Eurodollar
bond market yesterday.
The Kingdom of Denmark braved unfavourable market conditions to launch a
Dollars 300m three-year deal, taking advantage of a rare swap opportunity.
However, investor demand remains firmly focused on the D-Mark bond market.
A batch of sovereign borrowers is still eyeing that sector in the wake of
the UK's DM5.5bn five-year deal, priced yesterday.
The coupon was set at 7 1/8 per cent, with a fixed re-offer price of 99.96,
to yield 10 basis points above the five-year German government paper.
In a bout of euphoria after the deal was freed to trade, the spread
tightened to seven basis points over the curve, but profit-taking soon
pushed the spread back to 10 basis points.
Meanwhile, Denmark's Dollars 300m three-year issue, arranged by Goldman
Sachs, struggled against a soft US bond market.
A change in sentiment on US interest rates has both improved swap market
conditions and weakened the bond market. Expectations that interest rates
may have reached their cyclical low and could start rising soon, fuelled by
worries ahead of next month's elections, have encouraged more companies to
lock in fixed-rate funds while absolute rates are at their low point.
Consequently, a spate of fixed-rate payers has appeared in the swaps market,
causing three- and four-year swap spreads to widen to about 60 basis points.
The same expectations, meanwhile, are discouraging investors from buying
short-dated bonds.
Denmark's three-year deal was considered a touch aggressive, offering 41
basis points over the comparable Treasury yield.
However, Denmark, with a strong credit rating of AA1 from Moody's and
AA-plus from Standard &amp; Poor's, appears to be emerging unscathed from the
financial crisis besetting the rest of Scandinavia, and has less borrowing
to complete.
In addition, some investors were attracted to the deal by a positive view on
the currency.
The spread widened by one basis point to 42 basis points over the curve. The
proceeds of the issue are believed to have been swapped into dollars at
around 15 basis points under Libor.
Elsewhere, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester joined the list of UK building societies
to raise Tier One capital through an issue of permanent interest bearing
shares (Pibs).
The Pounds 100m issue of irredeemable notes, arranged by Salomon Brothers,
was priced to yield 270 basis points over the yield of the 9 per cent gilt
due 2008, and was placed solely with UK institutions.
The deal met strong demand from UK insurance companies, which need to hold
this type of paper in order to fund endowment policies, according to the
issue's lead manager. There is a lack of paper at the long-end of the
sterling bond market.

FT  22 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Sequal trade system to be
launched today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECOND of three electronic trade confirmation systems, designed to help
institutions confirm securities trades in Europe more efficiently, will be
launched today in the face of complaints that it will stifle competition.
The London Stock Exchange's Sequal is one of three systems approved by a
group of investment institutions, which set out a year ago to promote better
pre-settlement systems in Europe.
However, the exchange's plans have prompted a complaint to the UK's Office
of Fair Trading from a rival system provider, the Thomson group, on the
grounds the exchange will make its system compulsory for its members.
The exchange said the complaint was based on a misunderstanding, though it
accepted it had helped provoke the confrontation. Sequal is due to replace
Checking, the trade reporting system which is compulsory for exchange
members. By implication, Sequal will also be compulsory.
The exchange said it would not take a decision on the issue for some time.
Until it does, the OFT will have no new grounds on which to investigate its
operations.
The situations of the three trade confirmation systems is complicated by the
different regulatory position of the various providers. The exchange, for
instance, claims a duty under the Financial Services Act to ensure trades
are completed, forcing it to require brokers to use its own trade
confirmation system.

FT  22 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Regulators prepare for new
approach to conglomerates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SECURITIES watchdogs from around the world will next week unveil their views
on how financial conglomerates should be regulated, revealing a difference
in approach to that broadly favoured by banking regulators.
In a paper to be presented at the annual conference in London of the
International Organisation of Securities Commissions (Iosco), the regulators
will outline a series of principles for overseeing diverse financial groups.
The regulation of such entities - which combine businesses regulated by
different agencies, as well as businesses which fall outside the scope of
regulation - remains one of the most vexed questions for financial
supervisors.
Banking regulators, through the Basle committee on banking supervision, have
opted for an approach based on consolidation of the various businesses in a
group, with a broad capital adequacy test applied to the group as a whole.
The securities regulators, on the other hand, will advocate a more
qualitative test, rather than this rigid consolidation process. This would
include assessments of such things as the management and structure of
financial conglomerates, with appropriate limits set on intra-group
exposures to try to limit any contagion between different parts of a group
if one part experienced difficulties.
The paper, produced by Iosco's technical committee, chaired by Mr Richard
Breeden, chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission, is one of a
number of initiatives due to be announced at the Iosco meeting, which will
be attended by more than 500 securities regulators from around the world.
The regulators are also due to issue a statement on money laundering, which
will provide guidance for exchanges and broker-dealers on how to combat the
use of securities and futures markets to launder 'black' money.
They are also expected to endorse the auditing standards agreed by the
International Auditing Practices Committee.

FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Colossus shakes Austrian
financial markets - The mixture of vigour and timidity shown by one-year-old
Bank Austria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR a bank that is only a year old, Bank Austria has made its presence felt
in Austria's languid financial markets.
It has sacked three top executives following the discovery of massive loan
losses in the UK and the US; it has driven up domestic interest rates for
loans; and it has mounted a boardroom challenge to an aspiring competitor.
But Bank Austria is not just any bank. It became, through a merger last
October of two venerable Viennese financial institutions, the country's
largest bank at a stroke. And it is trying to assert leadership in a market
where banks, most of them state-owned, have been more interested in market
share than in making profits.
Yet Bank Austria, itself state-controlled, is being extremely timid about
implementing the rationalisation that must follow its merger.
So far, not a single branch has been closed, although bank executives
acknowledge that at least 50 of the 360 are blatantly redundant. Fewer than
300 of the bank's 9,700 employees have lost their jobs. And only a couple of
branches have been fitted out with the bank's new insignia and symbols.
This timidity stems in large part from the bank's roots. Its two predecessor
banks, the Zentralsparkasse group of Viennese savings banks and
Osterreichische Landerbank, were in the socialist camp.
An agency of the city of Vienna was the dominant shareholder in
Zentralsparkasse, and Mr Helmut Zilk, the city's socialist mayor, remains
chairman of Bank Austria. The national government had a majority stake in
Landerbank, with socialists holding the majority in the boardroom and senior
executive positions.
Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, the chief executive, disclosed last month that the
bank intended to close about 50 branches over the next two years. He has
also said up to 1,500 jobs would be lost by the end of 1995. 'The next two
years are the difficult ones,' according to Mr Haiden. 'It is going to be
hard, but we will do it.'
Bank executives claim they have done better on paring administrative costs,
notably combining back-office premises. And they say the delay in installing
the new identity at branches was due to dissatisfaction with the first
design.
On the business front, the new bank has been more impressive. Within weeks,
directors had to deal with severe problems in the UK and US branches
inherited from Landerbank. In February, they announced a Sch5bn (Dollars
472m) charge for extraordinary losses on bad loans and sacked three
executives.
As the losses and the executives came from the Landerbank side, bank
directors knew their tough action would contribute to the view that the
merger had really been a rescue of Landerbank, and that this would undermine
staff morale.
But the crisis passed without upheaval, and the bank has reassured former
Landerbank staff by making clear that Mr Gerhard Randa, their former chief
executive and now deputy chief executive of Bank Austria, would take over
from Mr Haiden within the next three years.
The bank then set out to use its new market leadership position to reassert
discipline in pricing of services.
Past attempts by a bank to raise interest rates or customer charges were
usually undermined by competitors. Lending spreads have been thin in the
Austrian market, now averaging 1.75 per cent, according to Mr Haiden, a full
1 percentage point less than needed.
In April, Bank Austria raised charges on private cheque accounts by 25 per
cent, the first significant increase in several years, and others followed.
In July, it boosted lending rates by 0.0025 to 0.005 per cent but froze
rates on deposits. Again, everyone followed.
'It looks as if Haiden has broken the pattern,' says Mr Heinz Handler,
banking analyst at the Austrian Institute of Economic Research (WIFO).
Others say that all banks are making such poor profits that they are
co-operating.
Bank Austria's first-half pre-tax profits tumbled 15.7 per cent to Sch867m,
while those of Creditanstalt, the second largest bank, were down 9.5 per
cent to Sch845m.
Bank Austria's latest offensive is aimed at blocking the attempt by
GiroCredit, the country's third largest bank, to expand its retail strength
in the Austrian provinces. Following a confrontation last week, both sides
backed down, but it looks as if Bank Austria will soon get rid of its 30 per
cent stake in Giro.
These manoeuvres will not be enough to rescue Bank Austria from a
disappointing first full year. Mr Haiden has forecast some improvement in
the second half, but net income could be 10 per cent below last year's
Sch2.1bn.
And if market conditions remain depressed, the bank will rationalise more,
even if it is run by socialists. 'If the bad situation persists, all the
large banks will have to make big changes to their cost structures,' Mr
Randa predicts.

NATIONAL Australia Bank last night said it had acceptances for 85.61 per
cent of the ordinary shares in its ADollars 1.1bn (USDollars 786m) takeover
target, Bank of New Zealand. The bid, which closes on November 9, needs 90
per cent acceptance to be made unconditional.
NAB said institutional shareholders, holding more than 10m BNZ shares, had
accepted the offer, following a visit to New Zealand by Mr Don Argus, NAB
managing director. New Zealand's securities commission has ruled out an
inquiry into BNZ which could have affected NAB.
Standard and Poor's Australian Ratings removed NAB from negative credit
watch and said BNZ's rating would rise if the bid succeeded.

fall in earnings to 9%

<TEXT>
MALBAK, the industrial arm of South Africa's Gencor group, improved on its
forecast earnings per share with 113.5 cents for the year to August. In May,
it foresaw earnings of about 105 cents a share.
However, yesterday's results were 9 per cent lower than the 124.1 cents
achieved a year earlier, though the weighted average of shares in issue in
the latest 12 months was 40 per cent higher than in 1991.
This was the result of a R831m (Dollars 295.70m) rights issue, and a
substantial change in the composition of the group on September 1 1991, when
it acquired Fedfood and SA Druggists and disposed of Darling &amp; Hodgson and
half its stake in Standard Engineering. These transactions refocused the
group on the consumer sector.
Turnover for the restructured group rose by 30 per cent to R11bn from
R8.4bn, while operating profits rose 18 per cent to R851m from R720m.
Attributable profits advanced 28 per cent to R329m from R256m. In spite of
the fall in earnings per share, the dividend is being raised by 3 per cent
to 33.5 cents per share from 32.5 cents.
Mr Grant Thomas, chairman, said the performance was satisfactory given
difficult economic conditions and restructuring and rationalisation
expenses. He forecast maintained earnings for the year ahead, but said
economic conditions 'could well deteriorate further.'
The food division (Foodcorp) contributed 19 per cent to net profits,
packaging and paper (Holdains) 17 per cent and healthcare (SA Druggists) 13
per cent. Operating investments - holdings in Haggie, Standard Engineering
and ICL - contributed 15 per cent to earnings, while 19 per cent came from
rights issue proceeds.

FT  22 OCT 92 / International Company News: Minorco to buy Chevron copper
interest in Chile
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINORCO, the Luxembourg-based resources associate of South African mining
group Anglo American, has agreed to buy one-third of a Chilean copper
project for Dollars 185m from a subsidiary of Chevron, the US oil group.
Under the deal, Minorco acquires Chevron Exploration Corporation of Chile's
interest in the Collabuasi copper project.
Minorco will assign the interest to a new company to be 50.1 per cent owned
by Minorco and 49.9 per cent by Empresa Minera de Mantos Blancos, a Chilean
company, which is 74 per cent owned by Anglo American.
The new company will be called Minera Mantos Minorco and will be listed on
the Santiago stock exchange.
The deal is subject to Falconbridge and Royal Dutch/Shell, CECC's partners
in the project, not exercising their rights to acquire the interest.
Four separate copper deposits have been identified within the Collabuasi
area. A pre-feasibility study, commissioned by the joint venture partners,
should be completed in the second quarter of 1993.
Minorco believes the project's start-up date will be 1996-7. Initial
indications show ore reserves of about 1.1bn to 1.2bn tonnes with a grade of
more than 1 per cent copper.
Collabuasi is located in northern Chile, about 30km west of the Chilian
border with Bolivia.
Chevron, which is believed to have paid about Dollars 45m for its original
investment, is said to be divesting all of its non-petroleum interests.

rationalisation

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ENSO-GUTZEIT, the Finnish pulp and paper group, cut losses to FM283m
(Dollars 59m) in the first eight months from FM384m a year earlier.
Its performance benefited from rationalisation, but the pace of its recovery
slowed in the second four months because of continuing over-capacity and the
weak dollar. Sales rose 4.7 per cent to FM6.38bn, with the biggest increases
recorded for pulp and paperboard, sawn goods and laminating papers.
The operating margin was FM917m, or 14.4 per cent of sales, against FM740m,
or 12.2 per cent, a year ago. Exchange losses on foreign loans were reduced
to FM126m from FM289m. The loss per share was FM2.33, against FM3.10.
The group declined to give a forecast for the full year because of exchange
rate uncertainty, but said losses would be lower than the FM950m last year.
Finland's decision in September to float the markka will raise financial
expenses by FM400m, but cash flow will improve.
Celsius, the Swedish state-owned industrial-military group, made a profit
(after financial items) of SKr345m (Dollars 61m) for the first eight months
compared with a profit of SKr427m in the previous corresponding term, writes
Robert Taylor in Stockholm.
Net sales increased to SKr7.7bn from SKr5.6bn, and the order books totalled
SKr22bn at the end of August.
The profit for the whole of 1992 is expected to be similar to last year's
total of SKr507m.

KAO, the Japanese toiletries maker, yesterday reported a 6.9 per cent rise
in taxable parent profits to Y21.2bn (Dollars 173m) for the first half to
September, from Y19.91bn a year earlier, due to firm demand for its new
shampoos, cosmetics and detergents. This exceeds the group's April forecast
of Y20bn.
The progress was made despite Japan's fall in personal consumption, with
sales rising 5.8 per cent to Y305.2bn, compared with a previous Y288.54bn
and an April forecast of Y300bn.
Kao said sales by its personal care and cosmetics division rose 9.3 per cent
to Y109.6bn, thanks to new facial cleansers and powders and a new coloured
hair rinse.
Laundry detergent and soap sales rose 3 per cent to Y120.7bn on solid demand
for fabric softeners and bleaches. Sales of hygiene items, such as
disposable nappies, grew 12.4 per cent to Y35.7bn. In contrast, chemical
sales fell 0.3 per cent to Y39.2bn, due to a slump in industrial demand.
For the full year to March, Kao expects taxable parent profits to rise 3.3
per cent to Y43bn.

CONCORDE Pacific, a Canadian company controlled by Hong Kong magnate Mr Li
Ka-shing, is bringing in an outside partner to help finance a large property
development on Vancouver's waterfront.
Canadian Maple Leaf Financial, a publicly-traded company which has its
origins in a fund set up for investor immigrants mostly from Hong Kong, has
agreed to contribute CDollars 150m (USDollars 120m) in equity and debt to
develop a section of the 12m sq ft Pacific Place project.
In return, Mr Li will become a significant minority shareholder in Canadian
Maple Leaf (CML), whose interests include investments in Canada's biggest
car park operator. CML has also helped finance the Canadian production of
Phantom of the Opera, and has a stake in a stage lighting and sound company.
Mr Stephen Funk, CML's president, said Concorde Pacific would invest about
CDollars 5m in the form of a convertible debenture.
Pacific Place is one of the biggest residential and commercial projects
under construction in North America. It will cover about 200 acres, or 50
blocks, on the site of the Expo 86 fair on the southern fringe of
Van-couver's business district.
The plans include 42 apartment buildings and 3m sq ft of offices, shops and
a 400-room hotel. CML's contribution will be used to finance about 1m sq ft
of low-income housing on the site.
Concorde also recently sold a small parcel of the development to a sports
and entertainment company which plans to put up a small stadium.
Mr Li and his partners bought the Pacific Place site from the British
Columbia government in 1988 for CDollars 320m. Concorde made a down payment
of CDollars 50m, with the rest to be paid between 1994 and 2003.

UNITED Technologies, the US aerospace-to-elevators group in the throes of a
cost-cutting programme, yesterday reported a 19 per cent increase in
third-quarter earnings as improved profits in several divisions offset the
depressed state of its Pratt &amp; Whitney aero engine business.
UTC reported net income of Dollars 142m, compared with Dollars 119m in the
same period of last year. However, after changes in the tax treatment of
dividends on the company's preferred stock, this translated into earnings
per share of 89 cents, up from 85 cents. Revenues totalled Dollars 5.4bn, up
from Dollars 5.3bn.
Mr Robert Daniell, chairman, said: 'All business segments showed improved
earnings except power (Pratt &amp; Whitney), which continues to be severely
affected by the depressed state of the global airlines and by defence cuts.'
Pratt announced last week it was speeding up and expanding its workforce
cuts, losing 7,500 jobs by next June, against an original plan for a 2,400
reduction by that date, because of much lower demand for new engines.
Pratt reported a third-quarter operating profit of Dollars 32m, down from
Dollars 127m, on revenues of Dollars 1.5bn, compared with Dollars 1.7bn,
primarily due to lower earnings on commercial spare parts and new engines.
The commercial spares order rate in the quarter was 28 per cent lower than
in the first half of the year.
The company's flight systems business, which includes Sikorsky, the
helicopter manufacturer, reported profits of Dollars 111m, up from Dollars
41m on revenues unchanged at Dollars 1bn.
The company said this was due to a continuing strong performance at Sikorsky
and Hamilton Standard, and reduced losses at its Norden radar business.
Building systems, which includes Otis, the elevator company, and Carrier,
the air conditioning manufacturer, saw profits rise from Dollars 122m to
Dollars 148m on revenues up from Dollars 2.1bn to Dollars 2.3bn, because of
cost-cutting and Carrier's market share gains in the US.
Automotive products produced profits of Dollars 36m, up from Dollars 18m,
thanks mainly to gains on disposals. For the nine months, net income rose to
Dollars 417m, or Dollars 2.84, up from Dollars 203m, or Dollars 1.42, on
revenues up to Dollars 16.3bn from Dollars 15.5bn.

THE benefits of an accounting change helped Scott Paper, the world's biggest
manufacturer of toilet tissue, to a 9 per cent improvement in third-quarter
net income, in spite of lower earnings from its printing and publishing
papers business.
Net income was Dollars 30.6m, or 41 cents a share, against Dollars 28m, or
38 cents, last year. The accounting change contributed about 12 cents to
per-share earnings in the latest quarter.
Sales in the three months rose 8 per cent to Dollars 1.2bn.
Nine-month net income was Dollars 122.4m, or Dollars 1.65 including
accounting change gains of about 36 cents a share. Last year, earnings were
Dollars 87.8m, or Dollars 1.19. Sales rose 5 per cent to Dollars 3.7bn.

<TEXT>
HIGHER net interest revenues and an ability to contain the rise in bad debt
provisions helped Chemical Banking, the third-biggest US commercial bank, to
turn in a 35 per cent increase in its third-quarter net profits, to Dollars
282m.
The improved net, which translates into earnings per share of 98 cents,
against 95 cents a year ago, is in line with the better earnings achieved by
Chase Manhattan, another big New York-based bank.
Chemical, formed last year by the merger of Manufacturers Hanover Trust and
Chemical, said its bad debt provisions in the third quarter were Dollars
330m, compared with Dollars 313m a year ago but Dollars 345m for this year's
second quarter.
Net loan write-offs totalled Dollars 330m, against Dollars 307m in the third
quarter of 1991.
Mr John McGillicuddy, Chemical's chairman, said results were helped by a 15
per cent rise in net interest income, to Dollars 1.16bn, by strong trading
profits and improvements in fee-based services.
He forecast a decline in bad debt provisions and non-performing assets
'going forward'. Non-performing assets in the third quarter declined
slightly year-on-year, to Dollars 6.59bn from Dollars 6.66bn.
Mr Walter Shipley, Chemical's president, said the bank's merger-related
cost-cutting programmed was ahead of schedule.
The bank's Tier One risk-based capital ratio was a healthy 7 per cent at the
end of September, up from 5.6 per cent a year ago.
That ratio reflected Dollars 1.7bn in new common equity raised by the issue
of stock last January and by retaining Dollars 447m of earnings generated
during the first nine months of 1992.
For the first nine months of the year, Chemical's net income was Dollars
782m, up by 36 per cent from the same period last year.

BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third-biggest pharmaceuticals company,
reported a 5 per cent rise in third-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 589m.
The modest improvement, struck on quarterly revenues 13 per cent higher at
Dollars 3.1bn, translated into earnings per share of Dollars 1.14, compared
with Dollars 1.08 a year ago.
For the first nine months, net income was also 5 per cent higher, at Dollars
1.62bn. Revenues were 7 per cent better at Dollars 8.77bn.
Mr Richard Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers, said international sales were
particularly strong during the quarter, recording a 24 per cent improvement
thanks to foreign exchange gains and 13 per cent without calculating the
effect of currencies. This compared with US domestic sales that rose 6 per
cent.
Mr Gelb said all four of the group's core businesses - pharmaceuticals,
consumer products, medical devices and nutritional products - had better
earnings in the quarter.
One-time restructuring charges caused Eli Lilly, the Indiana-based
pharmaceuticals group, to suffer a Dollars 268.5m third-quarter loss. In the
third quarter of 1991 the company recorded a Dollars 297.5m net profit.
Sales in the quarter were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 1.48bn.
Restructuring and other special charges amounted to Dollars 519.6m.

MCI Communications, the second-largest US long-distance telecommunications
group, yesterday reported a 16 per cent increase in third-quarter earnings,
thanks to strong traffic growth in spite of the weak US economy.
The company reported earnings of Dollars 154m, or 58 cents a share, up from
Dollars 133m, or 51 cents, in the same period of last year, while revenues
rose 11 per cent from Dollars 2.4bn to Dollars 2.68bn.
The company said its traffic - which has been growing significantly faster
than the industry average - rose nearly 15 per cent compared to last year.
Yesterday's results were towards the upper end of analysts' expectations.
MCI said it expected to take a fourth-quarter one-time charge of Dollars 45m
because the realignment of its business units from a geographic focus to a
market focus.
It added that fourth-quarter revenues would probably be Dollars 60m, less
set-up costs, from the licensing of its intelligent network platform to a
consortium of Canadian telecommunications companies.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEXACO, the US energy group, yesterday disclosed a 5.9 per cent decline in
third-quarter net earnings, which it attributed to costs associated with
property damage caused by Hurricane Andrew and debt-related expenses.
The drop - from Dollars 286m to Dollars 269m - translated into earnings per
share of 94 cents, down from Dollars 1.01 a year ago. But Texaco maintained
that without special charges its third-quarter 1992 net would have been
Dollars 1.10 a share, or Dollars 309m.
Revenues were 6.9 per cent higher at Dollars 10bn.
For the first nine months of 1992 net income dropped by 26.4 per cent to
Dollars 714m on revenues 2 per cent lower at Dollars 27.97bn.
Mr James Kinnear, chief executive, said the operational performance in the
quarter reflected benefits from better crude and natural gas prices, as well
as efforts to control expenses. These benefits, however, were dampened by
weak refinery margins in the US and in major international markets.
In operating terms, exploration and production earnings in the US were
Dollars 189m in the quarter, against Dollars 129m a year ago. Manufacturing
and marketing earnings were Dollars 87m, up from Dollars 82m last time.
Exploration and production operating income outside the US was Dollars 66m,
down from Dollars 89m in the third quarter of 1991. Non-US manufacturing and
marketing operating profits were also lower, at Dollars 86m against Dollars
118m a year ago.
Texaco's petrochemical losses in the third quarter were Dollars 8m, compared
with Dollars 3m earnings last year.
On Wall Street, Texaco's share price closed Dollars  1/4 higher at Dollars
62.

KNIGHT-RIDDER, the Miami-based media group that publishes 29 daily
newspapers in the US, said improved advertising revenues contributed to a
10.9 per cent rise in third-quarter net profits, to Dollars 31.4m.
The profit, which translates into earnings per share of 57 cents, up from 54

Newspaper advertising revenues were 2.3 per cent improved year-on-year.
Classified advertising posted a 2 per cent gain and general advertising 5.6
per cent.
h On Wall Street, Knight-Ridder's shares fell Dollars 1 to Dollars 57.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Motors, the struggling US automobile manufacturer, yesterday added a
new problem to its list of woes - fighting rumours that its non-executive
directors are pressing for Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, to step down.
The company has strongly denied the reports, which surfaced in their
strongest form yet on the front page of yesterday's Washington Post
newspaper.
This quoted unnamed board sources as saying that the directors had grown
increasingly unhappy with Mr Stempel's performance, but were still debating
who should replace him.
Mr Bruce MacDonald, a GM vice-president, said: 'There is no substance to
these rumours at all.' He complained that such reports 'just do irreparable
harm to the morale and enthusiasm of this organisation'.
Mr Stempel, 59, was taken to hospital in Washington last week suffering from
high blood pressure, but has since resumed his executive responsibilities.
The Post claimed directors wanted to use the illness as an excuse for Mr
Stempel to step aside gracefully.
The board made clear last April it was displeased with Mr Stempel's
performance when it replaced him as chairman of the company's important
executive committee with Mr John Smale, an outside director who once ran
Procter &amp; Gamble.
At that time it also ousted Mr Stempel's right-hand man, Mr Lloyd Reuss, as
president and head of North American operations, replacing him with Mr John
Smith, formerly in charge of its international business.
GM is expected to announce third-quarter losses of up to Dollars 845m next
week and needs to slash its manufacturing costs in the US. But some analysts
argue the company's executives have yet to convince the workforce of the
urgency of the task.

BANCO SANTANDER, the Spanish banking group, raised third-quarter net income
by 13.8 per cent to Pta62bn (Dollars 626.5m) in the first nine months of the
year and will lift its interim dividend by 10 per cent to Pta143 per share.
The profit growth was in part due to a 29.5 per cent rise to Pta52.6bn in
other ordinary revenue, chiefly fee income, which compensated for a 4 per
cent fall to Pta485.6bn in financial revenues.
Santander was also able to reduce its financial costs by 6.5 per cent to
Pta337bn and contained the growth of total operating expenses to 4.9 per
cent.
In the breakdown of its Pta109.9bn total operating expenses, Santander
increased its personnel expenses by 7.2 per cent to Pta71.8bn but kept
overheads and taxes other than income tax virtually unchanged at Pta38.1bn.
Mr Emilio Botin, chairman, said the economic downturn and reduced demand for
loans had slowed growth.

<TEXT>
MMB, the French holding company controlled by Mr Jean-Luc Lagardere,
yesterday announced the terms of the financial arrangements for the proposed
merger between Matra, the defence electronics concern, and Hachette, one of
France's leading media groups.
Mr Lagardere, who chairs the three companies, first announced plans for the
surprise merger of Matra and Hachette in May. The terms are 11 Hachette
shares for every five held in Matra.
Hachette's shares were suspended at FFr129 and Matra at FFr178 pending the
announcement of the merger terms. Based on these prices, Hachette is
capitalised at FFr2.54bn and Matra at FFr4.69bn.
The announcement of the merger terms comes at a time of renewed speculation
that Havas, another force in French media, was the architect of a
share-buying raid on Hachette earlier this month.
A leading French newspaper yesterday reported that Havas, which had
previously denied buying Hachette shares, had bought a stake of up to 4 per
cent in an attempt to press Mr Lagardere into selling Europe 1, the radio
station.
Hachette's financial plight was one of the catalysts for the merger.
Hachette, which recently reported that its stayed in the red with a net loss
of FFr39.3m (Dollars 7.62m) in the first half of this year, has been hit by
the collapse of La Cinq, the French TV station in which it was managing
shareholder.

RHONE-POULENC, France's largest chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, has
agreed in principle to sell a potash and chemical products unit for more
than Dollars 100m - the latest move in an ambitious asset disposals
programme.
The state-owned group has agreed to sell Alsace-based Potasse et Produits
Chimiques (PPC) to Ethyl Corporation, a US chemicals group.
This puts Rhone-Poulenc on track to achieve its target of FFr5bn (Dollars
980m) in asset disposals in the two years to the end of 1993, a strategy
aimed at reducing the debts it built up to finance US acquisitions.
It sold FFr1.5bn of non-strategic assets in the first half of this year and
is expected to have sold just over FFr3bn by the end of 1992, with the rest
to come in the following year.
Rhone-Poulenc owns 65 per cent of PPC, with the rest owned by Entreprise
Miniere et Chimique, another state-owned chemicals group, which will also
sell its stake.

THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics supplier,
yesterday announced a 24.6 per cent decline in net profits for the first
half of the year and warned that it was expecting a fall in earnings for
1992 as a whole.
Profits fell in line with analysts' forecasts to FFr848m (Dollars 164.5m) in
the six months to June, from FFr1.12bn net in the first half of last year,
on a a 10.5 per cent decline in sales to FFr14.76bn over the same period.
Last April, Thomson-CSF forecast a profits increase for 1992, but warned
last month that it would not meet this target because of the collapse in
profits at Credit Lyonnais, the state-owned bank in which Thomson-CSF has a
15.5 per cent stake. Thomson-CSF has also had to pull out of a deal to buy
the missiles division of LTV of the US after running into political
opposition based on fears of domination by the French defence industry.
The group blamed the sales decline in the first half on the completion of
one of its largest contracts, to sell ground-to-air missiles to Saudi
Arabia, and the fact that missiles sales in the first half of 1991 were
unusually high due to the Gulf war. Accordingly, the missiles division
recorded a 35 per cent drop in sales. Earlier forecasts of a 5 per cent
decline in overall group sales this year were still valid, said Thomson-CSF.
Operating profits fell by 12 per cent to FFr935m from FFr1.06bn in the first
six months, where they represented 6.3 per cent of turnover, a small
improvement on the operating margin of 6.1 per cent in the first half of
last year.
Minorities contributed FFr214m to net profits, up from FFr65m, mainly due to
the treasury bank Altus Finance and SGS-Thomson, the Franco-Italian
semiconductor supplier. However, there was a FFr50m extraordinary loss, as
against a FFr167m extraordinary profit in the first half of 1991, mainly
from restructuring charges on Thomson-CSF reducing capacity in line with the
fall in demand from the depressed defence industry.

THE US insurance industry expects to pay out Dollars 10.2bn in claims to

Louisiana in late August.
The new estimate, released yesterday by the Property Claims Services

Even then, Hurricane Andrew was by far the most costly catastrophe which the
US property-casualty insurance sector has faced.
Many Wall Street analysts are suggesting the scale of the losses could
prompt a turn in the US property-casualty industry cycle which would allow
insurance companies to push up rates and move closer to making underwriting
profits.
The revised estimate for the losses seems likely to support this view.
One reason for believing the insurance cycle should turn following the
Hurricane Andrew losses is that property-casualty insurers are believed to
be carrying lower levels of catastrophe reinsurance than they were a few
years ago.
Some analysts suggest perhaps 20 to 30 per cent of bill may be passed on to
reinsurers, rather than the traditional 30 to 40 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Aluminum Company of America (Alcoa), the world's largest aluminium
company, yesterday signed a joint venture with Hungalu, Hungary's
state-owned aluminium monopoly, in the first stage of a Dollars 165m
investment.
Alcoa has agreed to pay Dollars 50m to take a 50.1 per cent stake in Kofem,
a Hungalu subsidiary making flat-rolled aluminium products and extrusions in
Szekesfehervar, south-west of Budapest. The remaining stake will be held by
the Hungarian parent company.
The new venture, Alcoa-Kofem, will invest a further Dollars 115m over five
years in improving product quality and safety. Alcoa will provide technology
and expertise, and will share sales and market-ing responsibilities with
Hungalu.
The State Property Agency, the privatisation authority, and Hungalu, which
the SPA owns on behalf of the state, also took over two-thirds of Kofem's
debts of about Ft4bn (Dollars 51m) to sweeten the deal.
Alcoa's move is part of the group's emphasis on expansion in Europe, where
prospects for growth in aluminium demand are significantly more promising
than in the US.
Mr Paul O'Neill, chief executive of Alcoa, was bullish yesterday about the
east European region, hoping that the Szekesfehervar facility could become
'the premier plant in this part of the world.'

First Maryland Bancorp, the US subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, reported
third quarter pre-tax profits of Dollars 37.6m (Pounds 21.8m), up some 27
per cent on the same stage of 1991.
The outcome contributed to a 43 per cent rise to Dollars 105.4m (Dollars

Mr Charles W Cole, First Maryland's president and chief executive, said:
'Improved interest margins and increases in fee income continue to
contribute to our momentum. Non-interest expense management has also
strengthened First Maryland's positive earnings trend in an environment of
sluggish loan demand.'
First Maryland has a 165-branch network, 142 in Maryland, 21 in
Pennsylvania, and one each in Delaware and Washington DC.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading margins improved at Le Creuset, the French-based but London-listed
maker of cast iron cookware and tableware, in the first half of 1992 and
pre-tax profit rose by 4 per cent.
Including Screwpull for a full six months, turnover grew 15 per cent to
Pounds 17.8m. But profits had to bear redundancy charges of Pounds 316,000
following relocation, while the comparative first half benefited from the
sale of the Paris office.
Also, interest charges increased to Pounds 651,000 (Pounds 241,000) leaving
the pre-tax balance at Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 1.1m). Earnings per share worked
through at 4.6p (4.4p).
Good volume growth was achieved throughout the group. Subsidiaries in the US
and UK again improved profits, and the Japanese company also performed to
plan.
In the immediate future directors believed modest sales volume increases
were achievable. They would also be implementing price rises in almost all
the main countries of operation by 'an appropriate percentage above
inflation'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wensum Company, a men's wear manufacturer, is halving its interim dividend
to 0.575p after incurring a loss of Pounds 46,000 for the six months to July
31.
That stemmed from a reduction in turnover from Pounds 4.18m to Pounds 2.83m,
and compared with a profit of Pounds 332,000.
Losses per share were 0.43p against earnings of 2.97p.
Mr Andrew Hughes, chairman, said overheads had been held in firm control
against continued poor trading in the high street.
Operating profit was just Pounds 10,000 (Pounds 403,000).
The corporate clothing division saw the greater decline in turnover as
repeat business continued to reflect lower staff numbers. Many customers
were also extending the life of uniforms.
Mr Hughes said turnover in Wensum Clothing, the manufacturing division, fell
following the loss of GA Dunn, historically one of the most important
customers.
However, recovery was on the way as the customer base continued to be
broadened, resulting in a strong order book throughout the remainder of the
second half and well into the first half of next year.

A sharp reduction in the value of its investment portfolio, from Pounds
17.9m to Pounds 12.4m, was reflected in a net asset value per ordinary share
of only 6.6p at Exmoor Dual Investment Trust in the year to August 31.
This compared with 89.5p for 1991.
Per income share, net assets came to 61.1p (64p). The figure for the zero
coupon preference shares was 163.1p (144.3p).
Gross revenue amounted to Pounds 1.49m (Pounds 1.5m) but administrative
expenses took Pounds 230,000 (Pounds 191,000) and bank interest payments
jumped to Pounds 4,700 (Pounds 341). Net revenue was Pounds 942,700 (Pounds
978,000).
Dividends declared for the year are: 1.85p (1.84p) per ordinary share on
earnings of 1.88p (1.96p) and per income share a maintained final dividend
of 2.75p makes 10.55p (10.5p) for the year on earnings of 10.68p (11.08p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHESTERFIELD Properties displayed a 'modest recovery' in profitability in
the first half of 1992, but in view of economic uncertainties the interim
dividend is halved to 3.5p.
Turnover moved up to Pounds 20.5m (Pounds 18.4m) and pre-tax revenue came to
Pounds 3.39m (Pounds 2.37m) for earnings per share of 5.48p (0.75p).
In the equivalent period of 1990 the profit was Pounds 7.84m.
The main reason for the improvement was an increase in rental income from
Pounds 16m to Pounds 17.9m.
Profits from the operation of West End theatres fell sharply, the impact of
economic conditions being aggravated by fewer American visitors.
Directors pointed out that the level of interest rates would be the factor
exerting by far the largest influence on future profitability.
A secondary one would be the cumulative impact of bankruptcies among smaller
tenants, which was increasingly noticeable as the recession deepened.

</HEADLINE>

BACKED UP by the acquisition of Airopak in the latter part of 1991, all
operations at Boxmore increased sales and profit for the half year to June
30 1992.
Including Pounds 3.64m from Airopak, turnover of this packaging
manufacturing group rose from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 15.8m and pre-tax
profit expanded nearly 23 per cent to Pounds 2.05m (Pounds 1.67m).
Airopak contributed to operating profit, but its purchase was made out of
cash resources which had an affect on interest receivable. Good progress had
been made in assimilating it into the group.
The carton division increased sales by 46 per cent, reflecting customer
satisfaction and the benefit of recent investment. In plastics they rose 9
per cent before taking in Airopak.
Earnings per share came to 7.3p (6.2p) and the interim dividend is 1.15p
(adjusted 1.075p).

FT  22 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Dissidents come under fire at Hoskins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISSIDENT shareholders in Hoskins Brewery, the Leicester-based real ale
concern, were yesterday accused of trying to gain control of the company
without making a bid for the shares.
In a letter to shareholders, Mr Barrie Hoar, chairman, said that their
investments in the company would be 'exposed to a significant level of risk'
if the dissidents succeeded in their attempt to remove him and his brother,
Mr Robert Hoar, from the board.
Resolutions to replace the brothers - whose family holds 30 per cent of
Hoskins - with Mr Richard Cattermole, head of Ryan Elizabeth, a pubs and
hotels operator, and one of his associates, Mr JE Lea, will be put to the
vote at an extraordinary meeting on November 18.
The meeting was requisitioned by a group led by Mr Cattermole, a 5 per cent
shareholder, and Mr Dennis Bailey, a director of Hichens Harrison, the
stockbrokers, and a former director of Hoskins.
According to Mr Barrie Hoar's letter, Mr Bailey was asked to resign from
Hoskins' board in November last year.
During his four years as a director, Mr Bailey was involved in advising
Hoskins on the acquisition of Netherton Ales, which resulted in a loss of
Pounds 250,000, and of Tatlocks, a catering company, which resulted in a
loss of Pounds 380,000, the letter states.
Mr Bailey had also proposed the acquisition of Edencorp Leisure, which owned
a Portuguese leisure centre, and was now in compulsory liquidation and under
investigation by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The letter adds: 'Shareholders in Hoskins have already suffered as a result
of Hoskins' brief association with Mr Bailey and Hichens.'
Mr Bailey said yesterday that he had resigned from Hoskinson his own
initiative after a boardroom row over the manner in which Mr Barrie Hoar was
negotiating the sale of the Tatlocks business to a former director.
'Mr Hoar is obviously attacking me because I supported Mr Cattermole's
demand for an EGM,' he said.
Mr Hoar's letter to shareholders also queries Mr Cattermole's business
record.
Of various statements that Ryan Elizabeth owned up to 60 pubs and five
hotels, it says: 'We have only been able to identify 26 pubs and four hotels
. . . of which seven pubs are closed and not trading, and the hotels are
shown in the latest accounts as loss making.
'Ryan's profits were wholly dependent on capitalising interest and the one
off sale of lease premiums,' it claims.
Mr Cattermole was not available for comment yesterday.
Hoskins recently sold nine pubs for Pounds 2.45m to Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley
Breweries, leaving it with its brewery and seven houses. Completion of the
deal will eliminate its borrowings and leave it with about Pounds 750,000
cash.

FT  22 OCT 92 / MSR will not complete rig buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTING A Pounds 1.9m pre-tax loss for the six months to June 30, Midland
and Scottish Resources said it would not exercise its option to complete the
purchase of the Emerald Producer offshore rig.
This means that Davy Corporation shareholders will not receive the remaining
Pounds 54m, or 45p a share, due under the takeover of the company by
Trafalgar House, the engineering and construction group.
Trafalgar made payment to Davy shareholders conditional on MSR, the oil
production company, completing the purchase from Davy of the Emerald
Producer.
MSR's Emerald Field Contracting subsidiary does not expect to secure the
first class bank guarantees needed to obtain a Section 10 ship certificate
from the Department of Trade necessary to complete permanent finance of the
rig.
The oil production company will continue to charter the Emerald Producer
from Trafalgar at Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 39,800) a day.
MSR's Pounds 1.9m loss compares with a Pounds 3m deficit last year. For the
year to 1991 the group incurred a Pounds 46.4m loss after a Pounds 37.5m
exceptional charge relating to the delay in completing the rig.
Turnover was halved to Pounds 1.9m and the cost of sales declined to Pounds
1.4m (Pounds 4.8m). Losses per share were 0.93p (1.3p).

FT  22 OCT 92 / DTI proceeds against former PPI directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry has launched proceedings to have six of
the former directors of Polly Peck International disqualified from becoming
company directors again.
Those named in the DTI application are believed to include both former
non-executive and executive directors in the company. However, Mr Asil
Nadir, the former Polly Peck chairman, is not included in the
disqualification action.
The DTI apparently takes the view that he is already disqualified from
holding a company directorship because he is an undischarged bankrupt.
The DTI's application is due to be heard in the companies court today.
Polly Peck, a fruit, electronics and leisure conglomerate with subsidiaries
across the world, was one of the stars of the London Stock Exchange for most
of the 1980s but collapsed with debts of Pounds 1.3bn in October 1990.
Although most of Polly Peck's main assets have been sold by the group's
administrators, creditors have been warned that they might eventually
receive as little as 11p in the pound.
Administrators are still seeking to gain access to assets held in companies
in the north of Cyprus.
The most recent sale was announced in August, when a Mexican investor group
agreed to pay Dollars 499m (Pounds 306m) for PPI Del Monte Fresh Produce,
the fresh fruit business. The agreement represented the administrators' last
hope to secure a large amount of cash to pay Polly Peck's 23,000 creditors.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Crown tries again to sell RFM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROWN Communications said yesterday it had entered into a second conditional
agreement for the sale of RFM, its loss-making French commercial radio
network.
The first conditional sale to a consortium led by NRJ, a rival radio group,
was rejected by the Conseil Superieur de l'Audiovisuel, the regulatory body.
Under the new arrangement the leading shareholder would be Mr Alain Ayache,
a controversial right-of-centre magazine publisher.
Mr Ayache announced earlier this week he would have 32.5 per cent of RFM
with Crown holding 20 per cent, NRJ 22.5 per cent and Credit Mutuel
d'Artois, a French bank, 25 per cent.
Crown, the USM-quoted commercial radio company which owns the London
Broadcasting Company, said yesterday it considered it likely that the new
deal would meet with CSA approval.
CSA officials have emphasised to French newspapers that no dossier on the
issue had been submitted and no transfer of shares in French radio stations
were valid without CSA approval.
RFM is currently under the direct control of a provisional director
appointed by the French courts - something that happened without the
knowledge of the Crown board.
Crown directors said yesterday they were confident 'that his appointment
will not impede the proposed sale.' It was not clear last night whether the
provisional administrator had been informed of the conditional sale.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Alexandra Workwear swings back to black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDRA WORKWEAR, a manufacturer and distributor of work clothes, returned
to the black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 672,000 in the first half,
against losses of Pounds 247,000 last time.
The swing was due largely to the absence of Pounds 1.5m in restructuring
costs taken as an exceptional item in 1991.
Operating profits for the 28 weeks to August 15 were 33 per cent lower at
Pounds 1.8m, on sales down from Pounds 31.4m to Pounds 30.9m.
Mr Gerald Dennis, chairman since April, said trading profits had been hit by
the decision to freeze prices to maintain sales.
However, selected price rises had been introduced in the second half which
would add at least Pounds 2m to turnover next year.
The board was upbeat about the outlook for the current year, saying that
further gains would be made through debt repayments and price increases.
Trading continued to be difficult, however, with volumes remaining flat.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.8p. Earnings per share were 1.3p,
compared with losses of 0.5p.
Mr Dennis said the uncovered dividend had been maintained as 'a signal of
the confidence we feel about the way the business is going'.
The balance sheet had been strengthened, with debt down by Pounds 2.6m to
Pounds 13.5m and gearing reduced from 87 to 63 per cent.
The company aimed to have gearing down to between 40 and 50 per cent by the
year end.
Stocks had been reduced by 8 per cent to Pounds 15.2m. A further Pounds 2.5m
would be trimmed in the second half and Alexandra planned to cut stocks to
Pounds 10m by the end of next year.
The group's businesses in France and the Netherlands had about broken even
when taken together.
Alexandra, which claims more than 30 per cent of the UK market for workwear,
has suffered badly in the past two years under the burdens of capital
intensive restructuring and the sharp economic downturn.
In 1990, the group had recorded interim profits of Pounds 4.1m.
Mr Julian Budd, finance director, said that capital spending requirements
for the foreseeable future would be minimal.
'We must not look at that investment programme negatively,' he said.
'We have been able to maintain turnover because we could supply the services
we needed.'

FT  22 OCT 92 / Micklegate losses increase to Pounds 4.75m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Micklegate Group, the property developer, finished the year to April 30 with
a pre-tax loss of Pounds 4.75m, after exceptional provisions of Pounds 3m.
The deficit compared with Pounds 806,000 last time when exceptionals were
Pounds 869,000.
Losses per share were 21.84p (2.79p).
Exceptional provisions comprised two items: Pounds 2.28m (Pounds 869,000) in
respect of properties owned by the group, and Pounds 732,000 to write down
the debt due from an associate.
Certain of the group's bankers have agreed in principle to defer and
subordinate part of the bank borrowings and to put the balance of their
loans on a term loan basis.
A proposal to reduce the share premium account will be put to an
extraordinary meeting on November 18.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World slowdown strips gloss from ICI: The company is
struggling and poised to deliver more bad news
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT THURSDAY, Imperial Chemical Industries, Britain's biggest manufacturer,
reports its third-quarter results. They will make grim reading.
Analysts, who had underestimated the duration and severity of the world
economic slow-down, have been busy cutting their estimates for the group's
full-year pre-tax profits from Pounds 756m to as low as Pounds 600m. That
compares with peak profits of Pounds 1.53bn in 1989.
ICI is proposing to demerge itself, separating its pharmaceuticals,
agrochemicals and most of its specialities operations into ICI Bioscience,
leaving industrial chemicals, paints, materials, explosives and regional
businesses in a new ICI.
Both future businesses have problems. ICI Bioscience is faced with falling
earnings from its pharmaceuticals division, while the new ICI is grappling
with considerable difficulties in its industrial chemicals operations.
Materials and specialities divisions are also suffering weak demand and
lower prices.
Most of the new ICI's operations are suffering from the world slowdown.
Trading over the past quarter for all of the large chemical groups has been
terrible. Dow, BASF and Rhone-Poulenc have all issued gloomy trading
statements. The slowing German economy has added to the sector's woes. For
ICI, July and August were weaker than normal and there was no tangible
upturn in September, according to Kleinwort Benson, the broker.
Industrial chemicals, allocated to the new ICI, was once the company's
cash-cow. In 1989, it generated operating profits of Pounds 452m on turnover
of Pounds 3.8bn. Kleinwort Benson believes the division could make a profit
this year of Pounds 45m on turnover of Pounds 3bn. The operations could well
be in losses this quarter.
The paints division, which represented about 12 per cent of the group's 1991
sales and 11 per cent of operating profits, is also suffering. ICI is the
world's largest paint producer, but poor demand in Europe and a weak dollar
have hit volumes. The dismal state of the UK's DIY market has done little
for the decorative paints business.
A recent seminar on the business suggested there could be rationalisation
among the paints division's 60 sites around the world. Mr Albert Richards at
Credit Suisse First Boston, believes possible disposals include the steel
coil, powder paints, wood coatings and a small marine business. These
represent about 10 per cent of sales. This week the division sold its
aerospace coatings business to Courtaulds, the UK materials group.
ICI's own materials division lost Pounds 20m last year on turnover of Pounds
2bn. Hoare Govett, the broker, expects the business to make operating
profits of Pounds 36m this year. The films operations are probably losing
money and overcapacity in acrylics is pulling down margins. The advanced
materials business is being downsized.
Meanwhile, ICI Bioscience's future operations also face problems. The
pharmaceuticals division, which contributed 12 per cent of turnover last
year and 52.1 per cent of profits, is beset by difficulties.
Last year the division made operating profits of Pounds 538m on turnover of
Pounds 1.59bn providing margins of 33.9 per cent - an impressive figure,
even by pharmaceuticals industry standards. Much of that profit was
generated by Tenormin, a beta-blocker used for cardiovascular treatment,
which had sales last year of more than Pounds 600m.
However, Tenormin's patents expired during September last year in the US,
which provided about 45 per cent of sales. The company had expected sales to
fall 50 per cent over two years as its position was attacked by generic
competitors. But sales have fallen further, faster than expected: July
prescriptions were down 45 per cent on the previous year.
ICI did, at least, expect to lose Tenormin revenues. This year's unexpected
blow was the withdrawal, because of side-effects, of Temafloxacin, an
antibiotic the company licensed from Abbott of the US to fill a gap in its
product line.
The division is trying to compensate with new products such as Zoladex,
Zestril and Diprivan, but their combined sales were less than Pounds 400m
last year. The division's profits and turnover are likely to be lower than
last year.
ICI Bioscience's agrochemicals and seeds businesses, the world's second
largest after those of Ciba-Geigy of Switzerland, are also suffering. The
division generated 10.3 per cent of ICI's sales and 13.9 per cent of
operating profits last year.
In the short-term, sales have been hit by poor weather. In the longer term,
volumes are likely to be hit by recent reforms of the European Community's
common agricultural policy. The division could make a loss in the second
half - always its weakest six months - of Pounds 19m.
Specialities businesses are also being affected by the recession. Last year
they generated 9.6 per cent of sales and 3.4 per cent of profits. They may
make Pounds 60m this year, according to Kleinwort Benson.
Not all the news for ICI is bad. More than 80 per cent of the group's
revenues come from outside the UK, so the devaluation of sterling will
contribute to profits. Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the broker, reckons this
could add Pounds 120m to ICI's bottom line next year.
Other good news includes the European Commission's decision to allow its
assets swap of fibres for Du Pont's acrylics businesses. This provides
Pounds 250m in cash and opens the way for other deals. BASF has said it has
considered buying ICI's polypropylene operations.
Nevertheless, the outlook for ICI remains poor. The market will be watching
ICI carefully over the next few months to see whether the group makes any
further unexpected moves.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Aer Lingus set for deep cuts in network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AER LINGUS, the Irish state-run national airline, is poised to make
substantial cuts in its route network in an effort to stem mounting losses -
currently running at IPounds 40m (Pounds 43.4m) per year.
The company confirmed yesterday that 'an intense review of operations is
underway', but refused to comment on local media reports that the cuts could
result in more than 1,000 redundancies from its 6,500 workforce.
A board meeting today is to hear a report on the review, which is thought to
be near completion, but no decision is expected until the next board meeting
in November.
Aer Lingus recently suspended services to Paris and Amsterdam via
Manchester, as well as its Dublin-Gatwick route.
Mr Ray Burke, a former industry minister, and prominent backbencher in the
ruling Fianna Fail party, yesterday called for a cash injection from the
government.
The company's air transport operations have been in the red since 1988.
Losses rose to IPounds 19m in 1989-90, and deepened to IPounds 42.5m in
1990-91 in the wake of the Gulf war and recession.
Cost-cutting exercises shaved losses to IPounds 37.9m for the financial year
to March 31 1992, but analysts predict a renewed deterioration to IPounds
40m for the current year.
There is growing realisation within Aer Lingus that a new capital injection
would not resolve the problems without substantial restructuring.
The company suffered a setback in June when the GPA aircraft leasing group
aborted its flotation. Aer Lingus had hoped to raise up to Dollars 45m
(Pounds 26.1m) in selling part of its 20m shareholding.
The Dublin-Heathrow route, one of Aer Lingus's principal sources of income,
has experienced intense price competition since UK-Ireland services were
liberalised in 1985. British Airways decided to withdraw services to Ireland
in January 1991 because of losses.
One glimmer of hope is if the government drops the 'Shannon stop-over'
obligation on all transatlantic flights in and out of Ireland. Aer Lingus
said it was unable to open new routes from Dublin to the US West Coast as
long as there was an obligatory Shannon stopover.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Facing up to the costs of a close shave: Wilkinson Sword's
new razor needs investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The name Wilkinson Sword still conjures up images of the proud British
military tradition out of which the business was born 220 years ago. But
much of the company's recent history has been less than glorious, while it
has also grown steadily more remote from its British roots.
Yesterday's announcement that Eemland, Wilkinson's Dutch-registered owner,
is putting it up for sale marks another of many changes of ownership since
1980, when it was acquired by Allegheny International, a US conglomerate.
Long respected as an innovator in the shaving market, Wilkinson repeatedly
failed to capitalise on its commercial achievements and has never fully
recovered from a loss of market share to the disposable razors introduced by
Bic of France in 1977.
The AI acquisition was supposed to put the company back on track by
providing capital for international expansion. However, those hopes never
materialised and AI plunged heavily into loss in 1986. Wilkinson was sold
that year to Swedish Match, which was itself acquired in 1988 by Stora
Kopparberg, Sweden's leading pulp and paper producer.
A year later, Stora sold Wilkinson to Eemland, a consortium of investors
including several Swedish financial institutions, JP Morgan, the New York
bank, and Gillette, the US company which dominates the world's wet shaving
market.
Since then, uncertainties over Wilkinson's ownership have persisted, as
competition authorities in several countries have challenged Gillette's
financial involvement in its smaller competitor.
Though Gillette insists that its 22 per cent interest in Eemland gives it no
influence over Wilkinson's management, the British government and the German
Cartel Office have ordered the US company to dispose of its stake.
Wilkinson today is a much smaller company than in the early 1980s, when its
operations included matches, garden tools, household products, fertilisers
and Scripto pens. These have been sold off one by one to leave a business of
which 85 per cent is wet shaving equipment and most of the rest male
toiletries.
But this business is more profitable than during much of the past decade.
Last year, Wilkinson earned operating profits of DM46.8m (Pounds 18.90m) on
sales of DM316.3m, and industry observers estimate that it could fetch a
price of as much as Dollars 300m (Pounds 184m).
Indeed, Mr Mike Dowdall, Eemland's chairman, says the recent recovery in the
company's fortunes is at the root of the decision to sell it. Since it
introduced Protector, a sophisticated system razor, in March it has been
scrambling to meet unexpectedly strong demand.
Mr Dowdall says that in Germany, Protector has seized leadership of the
systems shaving market from Gillette's rival Sensor razor, itself a big
success since it was launched in early 1990. Protector is also said to be
doing well in Britain and France, the two other countries where it is on
sale.
Wilkinson would like to launch Protector in other European markets and in
the US but it has been constrained by inadequate production capacity, which
will only be partly eased by a decision six weeks ago to expand output at
its UK plant by 50 per cent.
Mr Dowdall and his managers want to increase production still further and
step up sales and marketing efforts. However, building up sales in the razor
market does not come cheap. Gillette is estimated to have invested Dollars
200m to develop and tool up production for Sensor and earmarked a further
Dollars 100m for marketing in the first year after it went on sale.
Whatever sums Wilkinson is looking for are clearly beyond the scope of
Eemland's Swedish institutional investors. Faced with severe financial
difficulties at home, they concluded that they had no option but to sell.
Meanwhile, Gillette's conflict with competition authorities precludes any
increase in its stake. Rather, the sale of Wilkinson Sword offers the US
company a face-saving way of extricating itself from an increasingly
embarrassing regulatory quagmire.
Mr Dowdall, who is a former director of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer
products company, says he has held talks with several unnamed prospective
buyers but has been unable to agree on terms.
He believes Wilkinson's future would be best guaranteed if it were owned by
a big consumer products company with the resources, experience and
commitment needed to back the development of new products and marketing.
Among the most likely bidders are Bic, Warner Lambert of the US, maker of
Shick razors, and Colgate-Palmolive, the American toiletries and personal
care group.
However, all three companies have been mentioned as possible buyers of
Wilkinson on previous occasions. Whether any of them now judge that its
performance has improved sufficiently to justify the investment it needs may
become clearer in the coming weeks.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Smiths Industries reports 7% fall: Strong performance by
medical systems side offsets decline by aerospace division
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMITHS Industries said a strong performance by its medical systems division
had partly offset a drop in profits from the UK-based group's civil and
military aircraft businesses.
Smiths' pre-tax profits fell 7 per cent to Pounds 102.2m on sales of Pounds
635.3m, down 3 per cent. The group's shares closed 21p up at 329p.
Mr Roger Hurn, chairman, said: 'These results prove our resilience in a
tough economic climate. The performance of our medical system group was
outstanding, and both aerospace and industrial sustained good profit
margins.' Strong cash generation helped increase the group's net cash from
Pounds 79.1m to Pounds 120.1m. Mr Hurn promised to continue to invest both
internally and by acquisition.
Aerospace, which makes cockpit avionics systems, saw operating profits drop
20 per cent to Pounds 48.5m, although it still contributed just over half of
group operating profits. Turnover fell from Pounds 431.3m to Pounds 389.6m,
but Mr Hurn said the division had done well to achieve a 12.5 per cent
margin on sales, while securing important business on both commercial and
military aircraft.
Medical systems increased operating profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 29.2m
on turnover which rose from Pounds 125.3m to Pounds 133.4m.
Smiths said the growing market for its single-use devices for surgery and
intensive care was fuelled by worldwide demand for better protection from
cross-infection for staff and patients. Medical systems' markets suffered
less from the effects of recession, and this had benefited the medical
capital equipment business.
Operating profit from Smiths' industrial group was unchanged at Pounds 15.8m
on turnover of Pounds 133.4m (up from Pounds 125.33m). The group benefited
from the inclusion of the US ducting company Flexible Technologies, which it
bought for Pounds 33.3m at the end of the previous year. Smiths said the
excellent performance of the acquisition had offset the decline in existing
businesses.
Mr Hurn said the industrial group now comprised a cohesive group of
companies, all with good niche market positions. Although affected by
recession, they had achieved satisfactory results, generating margins and
cash which were exceptional for the engineering sector.
Earnings per share fell to 23.3p from 25.2p but a final dividend of 7.15p
(up from 6.8p) gives a total for the year of 11.25p, up from 10.7p.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Trafalgar accepts HK Land director
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the property construction and engineering group, yesterday
turned down a request to accept two directors of Hongkong Land on its board.
It accepted one, Mr Rodney Leach. Hongkong Land controls 14.9 per cent and
had wanted Mr Leach and Sir Charles Powell to join the Trafalgar board.
Mr Leach said: 'Trafalgar have taken the initial steps needed to go forward
and have promised more to come. We must continue to look at ways in which we
can strengthen its board.'
Hongkong Land is expected to continue to press Trafalgar to make Sir Charles
a non-executive director.
Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar's new chief executive, said: 'It did not seem
appropriate to appoint two directors from Hongkong Land to our board. The
request was made when Hongkong Land thought their shareholding would be
greater.'
Hongkong Land recently failed to increase its stake by tender offer.
However, Mr Leach said: 'We have the right to go up to 29.9 per cent.' He
added: 'We tend to have bigger stakes than 14.9 per cent.'
Trafalgar's boardroom changes included the appointment of Sir Archibald
Forster, chairman and chief executive of Esso UK, as another non-executive
director unconnected with Hongkong Land.
The appointment of Mr Alan Clements as non-executive chairman of Trafalgar
is an interim measure.
'In due course Mr Clements will be looking for a successor' said Mr Gormly.
Mr Clements, 64, who has a string of non-executive directorships, is
resigning from the boards of Brent Walker and Guinness Mahon Holdings.
Trafalgar has still to settle details of the compensation due to Sir Eric
Parker, the former chief executive, and Sir Nigel Broackes, former chairman,
for loss of office.
Sir Nigel was appointed life president, an honorary position without a seat
on the board. Sir Eric remains on the board until his 60th birthday in June.
Following criticism of its accounting policy from the Financial Reporting
Review Panel, Mr Gormly said the group would be 'as clear and upfront as we
can' when announcing its year-end results in December.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Yeltsin call to delay congress rejected by parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DMITRI VOLKOV
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION between reformists and hardliners brought upheavals in the Russian
parliament yesterday, as evidence grew of an approaching showdown between
the antagonistic groups.
The parliament yesterday heavily rejected, by 114 votes to 59, a request
made last week by President Boris Yeltsin to postpone the session of the
Congress of Peoples' Deputies, set for December 1, until the spring.
Mr Yeltsin wanted to avoid a clash between the more than 1,000-strong
legislative body, heavily dominated by Communists and nationalists, and the
reformist government - whose programme is deeply unpopular.
The rejection makes a clash apparently certain, with the likelihood that the
government will be voted out. Mr Sergei Kovalyev, a pro-government deputy,
said after the vote that the government's resignation was 'almost
inevitable'.
The parliament also called before it ministers and senior officials -
including Mr Anatoly Chubais, a deputy prime minister, Mr Andrei Kozyrev,
foreign minister, and Mr Gennady Burbulis, the senior presidential aide -
who had briefed foreign correspondents last Friday on the threat of a
reactionary coup against the president. They had also warned of the
formation of armed gangs by hardline forces including Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov,
the parliamentary speaker and a critic of the government.
None of the ministers and officials appeared, but a statement from Mr
Kozyrev was read in which he said that 'we warned the journalists, and we
are warning now about an attempt at revanchism (reaction) on the part of
some members of parliament'.
The angry deputies then voted to create a 13-member commission, dominated by
hardliners, to investigate the ministers' actions and recommend what action
should be taken against them.
Mr Khasbulatov later summoned a press conference to allege that he was under
constant surveillance, that his life was threatened and that the government
was becoming 'totalitarian'. He was later led from parliament, looking pale,
by Mr Yuri Yarov, one of his deputies.
In an intervention in parliament, Ms Bela Denisenko, the assistant health
minister, said she had seen Mr Khasbulatov and had told him that 'in my
opinion, according to external evidence, you are in a state of narcotic or
alcoholic intoxication', to which he had responded, she said, with
'ungentlemanly behaviour'.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Marching miners met by medley of rhetoric: 40,000 in biggest
London rally since poll tax riots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY WAS Trafalgar Day, but there was little sense of victory as more
than 40,000 miners and other trade unionists took to London's streets to
protest against the government's coal policy in the biggest rally in the
capital since the poll tax riots in March 1990.
After a subdued journey through Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens, the
marchers listened to the great and good of the labour movement telling them
that the government had not conceded enough and that their march was the
beginning of a great campaign and not the end.
Many of the marchers were less certain. Mrs Peggy Tomlinson, secretary of
the colliery band which led the march, said she was disappointed the turnout
had not been bigger. Behind her, a Yorkshire miner, 52-year-old Mr Alan
Bailey, said he and his colleagues feared for their redundancy packages.
Contradicting their own platform rhetoric, some senior union officials
worried, privately, that the government's partial U-turn would be enough to
damp the surge of feeling that has unexpectedly placed them at the helm of
mass protest.
'With the government conceding some ground, we are going to need good
judgment and organisation to keep up the momentum for a really fundamental
change in policy,' said one.
Reflecting the new emphasis that the National Union of Mineworkers is
putting on winning the hearts and minds of the wider British public, the
march remained disciplined. As it moved through Kensington, isolated groups
of shoppers and shopkeepers clapped while tourists looked on bemused.
A more strident show of solidarity was displayed by speeches in a half-empty
Westminster Central Hall, designed to keep miners amused before and after
lobbying their MPs. Labour MP Mr Dennis Skinner called Mr John Major 'an
incompetent wimp' and attacked the two non-Labour MPs on the platform, Mr
Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat, and Mr Michael Clarke, the Conservative
and former chairman of the Energy Select Committee.
Mr Clarke admitted he had little in common with his mainly leftwing audience
but was listened to respectfully as he put the case for coal. 'I do not
represent a northern Labour constituency, I represent a southern Tory one,
but I will be voting against the government because my constituents want me
to,' he said.
Mr Arthur Scargill, the NUM leader, arrived late, to the loudest cheers of
the afternoon, and said the British labour movement had crossed the Rubicon:
'For the first time in years, working men and women have expressed their
outrage and indignation at a government devoid of compassion and
understanding.'
But Mr Scargill did not call for strikes and emphasised the need for a
broadly-based campaign.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, found it difficult to arouse much passion
but received a polite hearing when he said that the coal crisis would return
to haunt the government.

FT  22 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Wilkinson Sword
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The decision to put Wilkinson Sword on the market looks like a forced sale.
Gillette is under pressure from competition authorities in the UK and
Germany to dispose of its non-voting stake. In March, the UK government gave
Gillette six months to get out. Several other shareholders - Skandia, Den
Danske and Trygg Hansa among them - could certainly use the cash. Wilkinson
is by no means the only industrial asset bought by Scandinavian financial
institutions in the late 1980s and now up for sale. That said, the company
will be better off with an owner willing to inject fresh capital. The latest
product range has already run into capacity constraints, resulting in a
postponed launch in some markets. Investment in new capacity and heavy
promotional expenditure will be required to claw back market share from
Gillette. This was clearly beyond the means of the existing backers.
So it is no surprise that an asking price of around Dollars 300m, a multiple
of nine times last year's earnings, looks cheap. Even allowing for the need
for capital investment, Wilkinson is a strong international brand in a
recession-resistent sector. Potential buyers might do well, though, to brace
themselves for a struggle to keep up with Gillette which has over 60 per
cent of the UK and German markets.

FT  22 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Smiths Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Being the star performer in the aerospace sector is a mixed blessing these
days, as yesterday's full-year results from Smiths Industries showed. Smiths
has effective management, a focused strategy, generates cash and has a
strong balance sheet. It also has a market capitalisation twice that of
British Aerospace. Unfortunately, production of the Boeing 737, which
provides Smiths' civil bread and butter, could halve by 1994-95. The
European Fighter Aircraft project is in doubt, and US defence spending will
continue to fall. Smiths' earnings have been virtually flat for five years,
and will remain so for at least another two.
Using its cash pile to expand into medical operations is the company's
chosen way out of the box, but there is a snag. Healthcare companies sell on
fancy earnings multiples. Smiths recently paid 20 times earnings for the
anaesthetics company Infotech. With Smiths rated at only 13 times earnings,
the company will have to work hard to prevent such acquisitions diluting
earnings. Even then, the medical division will only patch up part of the
hole blown in aerospace earnings.
A strategy of funding expansion from internally-generated cash deserves more
support than companies who use paper and acquisition accounting liberally.
But with the market starting to focus on growth, Smiths' management must
wish they did not have to start from here.

FT  22 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the balance of payments constraint, it would be foolish for Mr Major
to expect consumers to lead the UK economy out of recession. Confidence
among industrialists and exporters is probably now much more important. The
one is unlikely to exist without the other, though, which is why the retail
sales figures for September seem initially so encouraging. Yet, looked at
over the past year as a whole, the improvement - growth of 0.8 per cent - is
pretty marginal.
The September figures coincide with a period of unusually heavy discounting.
They also come in the immediate aftermath of the temporary rise in housing
market turnover prompted by the stamp duty exemption. Anecdotal evidence
suggests consumer confidence slipped again after Black Wednesday when the
full extent of the government's helplessness was revealed and a succession
of large-scale lay-offs were announced.
There is no particular reason why confidence should recover quickly, despite
the apparent reordering of the prime minister's priorities. Lower interest
rates alone will not compensate for job insecurity and the realisation that,
come what may, personal incomes are unlikely to rise much over the next few
years. Both are compelling reasons for consumers to avoid assuming more
debt. Lower rates will improve the cash-flow of households with mortgages.
With the savings rate already high, some of that money may find its way into
the shops. But there is unlikely to be a rush, especially now that real wage
growth is ebbing away. Retailers earlier waited in vain for higher real
wages to cure consumers of their debt aversion. They would be unwise to
place too much faith in lower interest rates succeeding where that solution
failed.

FT  22 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Major's rocky road
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prime minister's desire to encourage greater private sector financing of
UK infrastructure projects provides an intriguing twist to the new economic
agenda. Combined with the prospect of still lower interest rates by
Christmas, the idea yesterday helped put new life into the beleaguered
building sectors.
The appeal for investors lies in the potential boost to demand at a time
when public spending on roads - notwithstanding Mr Major's vague promises -
is in danger of being pruned to restrain the PSBR. It would be unwise,
though, to get carried away. There is certainly a case for further relaxing
the so-called Ryrie rules, which have effectively allowed Whitehall to
exclude private sector participation on a simple cost of capital argument.
By taking into account other factors, such as risks associated with other
construction costs and future revenue streams, projects such as the Dartford
crossing and the Birmingham north relief road have already been put into
private hands. The trouble is that the treasury remains a deeply reluctant
convert. Suspicion that private operators will milk the public purse remains
ingrained - as demonstrated by the unexciting returns Trafalgar House is
allowed on the Dartford crossing and by refusal to proceed with the Channel
tunnel rail link.
Even if the government loosens up its act, one wonders if the UK's
financially stretched contractors can respond. The banks already have a
greater balance sheet exposure than they care to admit. And there is likely
to be a lengthy lead time while routes are planned and environmental issues
resolved. Investors should not forget that 70 per cent of construction
output is still dependent on private housing and commercial property.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Yeltsin call to delay congress rejected by parliament
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DMITRI VOLKOV
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION between reformists and hardliners brought upheavals in the Russian
parliament yesterday, as evidence grew of an approaching showdown between
the antagonistic groups.
The parliament yesterday heavily rejected, by 114 votes to 59, a request
made last week by President Boris Yeltsin to postpone the session of the
Congress of Peoples' Deputies, set for December 1, until the spring.
Mr Yeltsin wanted to avoid a clash between the more than 1,000-strong
legislative body, heavily dominated by Communists and nationalists, and the
reformist government - whose programme is now deeply unpop-ular.
The rejection makes a clash apparently inevitable, with the likelihood now
that the government will be voted out. Mr Sergei Kovalyev, a pro-government
deputy, said after the vote that the government's resignation was now
'almost inevitable'.
The parliament also called before it government ministers and senior
officials - including Mr Anatoly Chubais, a deputy prime minister, Mr Andrei
Kozyrev, the foreign minister, and Mr Gennady Burbulis, the senior
presidential aide - who had briefed foreign correspondents last Friday on
the threat of a reactionary coup against the president.
They had also warned of the formation of armed gangs by hardline forces
including Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker and a bitter
critic of the government.
None of the ministers and officials appeared, but a statement from Mr
Kozyrev was read to the deputies in which he said that 'we warned the
journalists, and we are warning now about an attempt at revanchism
(reaction) on the part of some members of parliament'.
The angry deputies then voted to create a 13-member commission, dominated by
hardliners, to investigate the ministers' actions and recommend what action
should be taken against them.
Later in the day, Mr Khasbulatov summoned a press conference to allege that
he was under constant surveillance, that his life was threatened and that
the government was becoming 'totalitarian'. He was later led from
parliament, looking pale, by Mr Yuri Yarov, one of his deputies.
In an intervention in parliament Ms Bela Denisenko, the assistant health
minister, said she had seen Mr Khasbulatov after his exit and had told him
that 'in my opinion, according to external evidence, you are in a state of
narcotic or alcoholic intoxication' - to which he had responded, she said,
with 'ungentlemanly behaviour'.
Mr Vladimir Issakov, leader of the nationalist Russian Unity group, then
accused Mr Yeltsin of public drunkenness during the Tashkent summit of the
Commonwealth of Independent States in May - a charge he had made at the
time, and which had then been denied by Mr Yeltsin .
The confused events received a further twist when it was learnt that a
gunfight had taken place between parliamentary guards and members of the
Moscow militia on Tuesday, during which one guard was shot dead.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Brussels urges cuts in phone charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission called yesterday for greater competition to cut the
price of cross-border telephone calls in the European Community, but said it
would have to consult industry and consumers further before introducing
legislation.
Immediate full liberalisation of international and national calls has not
been ruled out - it is one of four options listed in the Commission's
long-awaited review of the telecoms sector - but Brussels said it favoured a
'gradual approach'. Consultation could take several months.
European consumer groups, which favour liberalisation with safeguards for
users, welcomed the review paper, but said they wondered whether the present
Commission was 'running out of steam' as it ended its four-year term.
Brussels has already taken action to liberalise more specialised telecoms
services, but the voice telephony market is very sensitive politically.
Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, denied the Commission was shy
of opening the market completely: 'We are not dragging our feet, we are
hoping to have a quick consultation on the options which have been
identified, having clearly given our preference.'
If the Commission and member states adopt the intermediate option, EC
companies could buy access to other member states' telecoms networks and
provide cross-border services.
The Commission would also hope to eliminate illogical differences between
the cost of cross-border calls: calling from Spain to Denmark, for example,
costs twice as much as calling from Denmark to Spain.
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, EC telecommunications commissioner, said
yesterday that cross-border calls within the EC accounted for about 4 or 5
per cent of the overall EC telecoms market.
All voice telephony - including international and domestic calls -
represents 80 to 90 per cent of the total.

The abrupt departure of Mike Whitehouse, 47-year-old operations director of
the Halifax, is yet another sign that the top management of Britain's
biggest building society is in a state of flux. Whitehouse, who has been
with the society for nearly 30 years, was one of the younger generation of
Halifax executives in the running to take over from group chief executive
Jim Birrell who steps down next August.
With Whitehouse off the scene, the internal front-runners to follow Birrell
are finance director Graham Folwell and Derek Taylor, managing director of
the estate agencies. Both are in their 50s. However, it looks likely that
the Halifax is going to recruit Birrell's replacement from outside.
One name which keeps on recurring is that of Andrew Longhurst, the
aggressive boss of the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society. He would
make sure that the Halifax remains number one.

What about the waiters? A form of exploitation of workers by management
probably unsuspected by the average restaurant-user has just come to light
in the Cayman Islands.
A court there has fined one of the leading hotels Dollars 375 for using tips
left for waiters to help in paying managers' salaries. The case was the
first brought under a 1989 law to stop hotel bosses from creaming off a
percentage of gratuities meant for underlings serving the public, including
bartenders and maids.
Whether they'll now have their wages cut by a compensating amount can only
remain to be seen. Meanwhile, in countries without such a law, anyone
wishing to be sure tips go to their intended recipient should perhaps hand
the waiter a cheque crossed 'a/c payee only'.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Observer: Sir Nigel ups anchor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So what next for Sir Nigel Broackes? While kicking them upstairs might be
the best way of dealing with interfering old age pensioners like Lord Forte,
Broackes is still only 58. And at that age, a man who founded a Pounds
4bn-plus turnover company will scarcely be kept occupied by an honorary
president's position.
There is a widespread view that Sir Nigel had taken his eye off the ball
some time ago, and this helps explain the company's current parlous
condition. Even so, the speed with which the company's founder has been
dumped is rather unseemly. He gets to keep his office, secretary and car but
not much else. Nor - unlike Lord Hanson as well as Forte - can he bask in
the reflected glow of a company named after him.
While admitting that the events of the last few weeks have been traumatic,
he is already busy planning. A fortnight on Monday he sets sail in his 155ft
ketch, Mikado, for the West Indies. First port of call will be the Antigua
Charter Agents Show. When one loses one's job, putting one's yacht out to
charter has its advantages.
Beyond that, who knows? After all, the late oil tycoon Armand Hammer did not
get involved with Occidental until he was 57. For the moment, however, it
looks as though Sir Nigel is less interested in commerce than in broadly
cultural matters.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Letter: Captive market reliance undermines British Coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The misfortunes of British Coal can to a large extent be ascribed to
the planning of British Coal's own management. It relied on the government
and the CEGB to provide and protect a captive market for it to continue to
sell effectively unrefined coal for naked burning in power stations.
Environmental protection was the least of its worries.
That is analogous to an oil company skipping the need for refineries and
telling its customers to design engines to run on crude petroleum.
With electricity privatised and clean natural gas available, there is no
defence for the traditional power station. Clean coal technology is
essential for new stations as, though the government placed no obligation on
the new generators to continue with British Coal, it insisted they reduce
atmospheric pollution.
The generators chose the obvious solution: gas. However, even had UK coal
been included, British Coal had placed all its development eggs for clean
coal technology in one basket. It had cornered the market for government
support and had barred the way.
Any technical merits of the British Coal 'Topping Cycle' cannot counter the
fact that it is unavailable.
More practical alternatives, of which British Coal was aware, are being
implemented overseas. These projects include British technology from sources
other than British Coal. When the inevitable return to coal takes place, the
UK will once more be relying on imported experience to even stay in the
race.

Sir, Prof Michael D Stephens' implied criticism of Sir Alec Douglas-Home's
mastery of economics (Letters, October 19) should not be allowed to pass
unheeded. Sir Alec's autocratic manner obscured his point that economics
might be understood using a matchstick model. Recent events suggest his
approach has merit, if only to save money on computers. Economics, as a
science, is only a tower of mathematical logic on foundations of sand.
Economists, like others, are wise after events.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Snake oil cures for depression
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BY SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The early 1990s have seen the collapse of the greatest experiment in state
direction in world history in the former Soviet Union, which now faces
hyperinflation and possible collapse. They have also seen the disintegration
of the much-vaunted Swedish 'third way'. At the same time western capitalism
looks in bad shape. Alas, only China, which combines emergent capitalism
with ruthless dictatorship, and openly models itself on Pinochet's Chile,
seems to be experiencing satisfactory economic growth - not a model for
those who believe that man does not live by bread alone.
For most of the western world, depression is a threat. In the UK it is
already occurring. In terms of indices such as real GDP, the recession is no
worse than that of the early 1980s. The difference is that the current
recession has been going on for so long and threatens to become worse. It is
also characterised by the number of companies which feel themselves
vulnerable, which are on the verge of sacking more workers, axing projects
or going into liquidation.
Until Black Wednesday the problem was that high domestic indebtedness was
holding back spending at home, while export-led growth was inhibited by a
sluggish world economy and a lack of competitiveness - not against the ERM,
but against the falling US dollar.
There is a parallel between the world problem of developing-country
indebtedness which burst 10 years ago and that of UK home owners with
negative equity today. Just as the central bankers in 1982 organised first
aid to enable overseas debt to be serviced and keep the banking system
afloat, a similar scheme is needed for home borrowers today. The new
Treasury authorisation for higher unsecured lending by building societies
points in the right direction, but is inadequate and too late.
The depreciation of sterling - so far 14 per cent on the index - has not had
its usual stimulatory impact because of the body blow Black Wednesday
delivered to confidence. The same demoralisation has deprived the two 1
percentage point cuts in interest rates of their normal effects. The
government's humiliation on coal has eroded confidence further and given
fresh life to an untenable view of full employment, which demands employment
at the same jobs and at the same or higher wages, irrespective of demand for
the final product.
Most dispiriting of all, judging by the FT letters column, is the number of
businessmen who expect economic leadership from government, as if the UK
were a single concern managed by a Whitehall Gosplan. When will they take a
lesson from their Italian counterparts and look for salvation at their own
hands and be pleased if government is not too corrupt, feeble and arbitrary,
as it is in most of the world most of the time?
The idea of the government 'going for growth' is the oldest piece of
claptrap in the business. No wonder John Major announced it out of the
corner of his mouth to the lobby, nine days after his chancellor had said
that he could not 'kick-start' the economy. Does one have to say yet again
that governments can spend - which on some rare occasions can be helpful -
but that lasting growth comes from the efforts of individuals and businesses
responding to market demand and technological opportunity?
Of course official policy has a role. Jonathan Wilmot of Credit Suisse First
Boston asks in his latest jeremiad: why are central bankers, governments,
the IMF, and many others still fighting the 1970s battle against inflation
and budget deficits when the real enemy is depression? One answer he
suggests is that too many people have been crying 'wolf' for too long. He
mentions the late 1970s, the 1982 world recession and debt crisis, the Wall
Street crash of 1987 and the Japanese stock market crash of 1991, all of
which were widely expected to lead to depression. He could have gone back
further.
The most dispiriting period I remember was in the early 1970s after the oil
price had risen fivefold. The world was faced by the combined threat of
depression and spiralling inflation; and in the UK the Heath government was
forced out of office by a miners' dispute which makes the present one look
like a storm in a teacup.
Fears of a world depression were indeed widespread much earlier. During the
late 1950s and early 1960s, Harold Macmillan used to harangue his
chancellors with tales of a new world slump, when they were struggling with
the problems of inflation and overfull employment; and truth to tell, I then
thought it radical and enlightened to be on his side against the
fuddy-duddies.
There has never been a shortage of people, ranging from City greybeards to
authors of paperback Marxist tracts, warning of coming economic collapse.
They were frequently joined by hard-headed industrialists who wanted cheap
money and plenty of it. During all this time we would have been better off
concentrating on halting inflation, promoting competition, and improving
supply performance.
Another reason for being sceptical of the prophets of doom is that they have
been dominated by fears of a repeat of the 1930s Depression, when US real
national income fell by a third in real terms and the value of world trade
fell by two-thirds. There can be depressions, such as those of the 1870s in
Europe and the 1890s in Britain, which are a good deal worse than the
post-second world war recessions, but which stop short of anything seen in
the 1930s.
Meanwhile, many of the financial talking classes cannot wait to see the end
of what they regard as the right-wing policies of the 1980s such as
de-regulation, curbs on union power, marginal tax cuts, privatisation and a
greater role for markets. Lifting their champagne glasses, and trying not to
look in my direction, they declare that these ideas have had their day and
that all who espouse them will be swept away. Meanwhile their expectations
of Bill Clinton (not yet in the White House) are so inflated that no mortal
can live up to them.
So may I put my head on the chopping block and say that the New Realism of
the 1980s, some of which began in Britain under Lord Callaghan in the late
1970s and some of which was carried forward by Labour governments in New
Zealand and Socialist governments in France, was a change for the better and
likely to stand us in good stead during both recession and recovery.
All these policies will be more, rather than less, necessary if a demand
stimulus is to be accompanied by growth rather than frittered away in higher
pay and prices. One reason why the US New Deal ran into the sand and a full
recovery not reached until the second world war was because President
Roosevelt tried to boost pay, prices and union membership rather than just
to maintain spending power.
Nor was there anything wrong with the switch in many countries in the 1980s
towards a nominal framework for macroeconomic policy. This framework could
have been explained without the monetary mysticism and the civil war between
the domestic and exchange rate monetarists, which has only benefited the
inflationists and the dirigistes.
A coherent nominal framework - that is, a cash objective for total spending
in the economy - is a safeguard both against runaway inflation and depressed
demand. We need public spending cuts, tax increases or a 'tough budget' as
much as we do a hole in the head.
I could accept nearly all Christopher Dow's New Deal-type suggestions
(Letters, October 21) for public works, tax holidays, guarantees for private
investment and so on, as long as it is made clear that these are expressed
in money terms. If public and private-sector employers fritter away the
proceeds in pay and price increases though, there will be no more to come;
in that case, there ain't gonna be no growth. One of Macmillan's wiser
warnings was against Britain being 'a sea of inflation in a world of
deflation'. Although he was wildly premature about the latter, the dangers
of Britain inflating all on its own remain.
However, the main danger of demand expansion being eroded by inflation comes
from the prospect of a sinking exchange rate. This warning may seem to go
against the experience of the 1930s when, after the UK went off gold, the
Bank rate was pegged at 2 per cent and the UK achieved a world lead in
recovery with an average growth rate of 4 1/2 per cent a year.
Leave aside the awkward fact that the recession did not touch bottom until
1933. There were other important aspects. The 30 per cent depreciation of
sterling did not trigger off inflation because world prices, and especially
American ones, were falling rapidly. That kind of deflation is fortunately
not now in prospect.
Even more important is that after a couple of years sterling rose again. The
pound recovered against the dollar after Roosevelt took the US off gold; and
against the franc when the Popular Front government did the same for the
French currency in 1936.
So in the medium term there was no depreciation of sterling. Contrary to
popular myth, the 1930s was not a period of free floating. After 1933
central banks co-operated successfully to 'stabilise' the market. From 1936
onwards a tripartite agreement between the US, France and the UK operated,
rather like an ERM without published bands.
The present danger is not that interest rates are cut too quickly now -
rarely does any authority do anything too quickly. The main fault of the
Bank of England and Treasury in floating rate periods has been
short-termism. They have been far too preoccupied with putting a brake on
the speed of sterling's fall over a few weeks, but much too complacent about
its downward drift over several years.
Thus I do not worry how low sterling will fall this winter but where it is
going to be in two or three years' time. Simply being told by the Treasury
that the inflationary implications of exchange rate movements will be taken
into account in setting policy cuts no ice whatever. Nobody is going to
believe a single word about good intentions for the future.
Nor is it sufficient just to call for a more independent Bank of England. We
would be no better off if interest rate changes were henceforth announced
'by the Bank of England with the approval of the Treasury' - a formula which
was used in the earlier post-war decades.
I know no better constraints in current international circumstances than a
statement that the government will return to the ERM as soon as
circumstances permit. Even that would not carry high credibility, but would
point in the right direction. If Tory backbench sentiment does not permit it
then we just have to remember that it is not for nothing that John Stuart
Mill called the Tories the stupid party.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Thaw after a long winter: Emperor Akihito's historic visit
to China
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Conscious of the weight of history bearing down on him, Japan's Emperor
Akihito carefully delivers each of his pre-scripted public words,
punctuating the sentences with uncomfortably long silences and filtering the
emotion from a voice still ascribed supernatural qualities.
His tones will be more carefully measured than usual when he arrives in
China tomorrow for the first visit by a Japanese emperor. The humble Akihito
has made clear a sense of deep privilege that his reign should be chosen for
this journey.
The emperor's most obvious task will be to deal with the relatively recent
past, the invasion of China during the 1930s and 1940s, by delivering an
unambiguous apology and, perhaps, clearing the way for an era in which the
economic potential of the relationship will finally overcome the bitter
memories.
For the Communist party leaders who invited the emperor, the six-day visit
has a less lofty, more immediate purpose. They are still in the process of
convincing the Chinese people that the regime has the respect of the
international community, and any foreign dignitary has been much appreciated
since the Tiananmen crackdown of 1989. In these circumstances, a visit by
the emperor is all the more welcome.
The Chinese government is also keen to attract Japanese investment, a
controversial issue during the early 1980s when the revolutionary elders
drew comparisons between Japanese joint ventures in northern China and the
occupation of Manchuria in the 1930s, an occupation begun in the name of the
then Emperor Hirohito, father of Akihito.
It is a sign of the changed times that six leading trading houses, including
Mitsubishi Corp and Mitsui &amp; Co yesterday announced a plan to build a
Dollars 4bn petrochemical complex in the northern Chinese province of
Liaoning. Japanese trading houses are also developing an industrial park in
the northern city of Dalian, and a Japanese trucking company has announced
plans for a transportation network in the north.
In the year of the Akihito visit, the 20th anniversary of the restoration of
Sino-Japanese relations, China will become Japan's second-largest trading
partner, behind the US, and up from fifth place a year ago. Japanese
investment in China, which rose from Dollars 349m in 1990 to Dollars 579m
last year, is likely to double this year, as manufacturers bruised by
falling profits source more of their components in low-cost and increasingly
reliable China.
The emperor is certain to laud this developing bilateral economic
relationship. But the flow of funds and an apology from the emperor are not
likely to appease a Chinese people raised on horrific tales of the 'burn
all, loot all, kill all' policies of the Japanese military during the second
world war.
Detailing the brutality of that period has served the Communist party's
interests as it highlights the 'heroic' role of revolutionary-era soldiers,
one of whom, Deng Xiaoping, is now an emperor himself in everything but
name. In deference to the Japanese emperor, Beijing has barred protests by
private groups seeking war compensation from Japan and taken much newspaper
space to explain the new, non-political role of Akihito.
Japan's foreign ministry is also emphasising the 'non-political' role of the
emperor, as enshrined in the constitution, and arguing that the event is
nothing more than a 'goodwill visit'. This interpretation is questioned by
some sceptical members of the ruling Liberal Democratic party.
Evidence of the relationship's rich and complex history is shown in the
varied opposition from left, right and middle-ground groups in Tokyo. There
are complaints that the timing of the visit violates the emperor's
'non-political' status and about the flattering of a discredited Chinese
leadership.
Then there is concern that the exalted Japanese emperor is travelling to
'pay tribute'. Even at the height of Chinese influence over the past two
millennia, during which Japan imported a written language and the essence of
its spiritual and philosophic beliefs, no emperor crossed the sea to
Beijing.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Letter: Thorny VAT zero rate problem persists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BEN PATTERSON MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article in the Financial Times on the new EC VAT system ('Exporters
pick up the pieces as barricades fall', Management, October 13) states that
the introduction of the 'origin' principle 'would have probably meant that
the UK would have had to drop its zero-rating of children's clothing and
many foods'. The point is repeated in the leading article ('VAT headache')
of the same issue.
From an economic point of view, that would be completely unnecessary.
A VAT-registered purchaser of zero-rated goods from the UK would gain no
more competitive advantage under an origin system than would already exist
through the zero-rating of deliveries to another member state under the
transitional system.
Indeed, most detailed studies (such as that carried out for the French
senate in 1990) have concluded that differences in VAT rates, in general,
can have little effect on competition in the case of the 95 per cent of
cross-frontier transactions which take place between VAT-registered traders.
The problem of cross-frontier shopping by final consumers is another matter,
but that problem would also exist already under the system applying from the
end of this year.
The problem is a purely legal one, arising from Article 28 of the 6th VAT
Directive.
That directive effectively allows the UK to retain the zero rate, but only
until 'the charging of tax on imports and the remission of tax on exports in
trade between the member states are abolished'. That is to say: until the
coming of the origin system.
The solution to this conundrum is a simple one, and has actually been
adopted by the European Parliament. Zero should be recognised as a proper
VAT rate, and it should become the 'floor' of the reduced-rate band.
That would have enabled the UK to retain the zero rate permanently, if it so
wished. Unfortunately it was derogation, thus ensuring that the whole issue
will come up again in 1996.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Letter: Grey chill scars French fashion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms SUZANNE JEAN-BAPTISTE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Are we seeing the first signs of strain on the French design industry?
In reference to 'The colour is grey for Paris spring fashions: Economic
chill takes the brightness out of French designers' big week' (October 14),
I must agree, and add that the French design industry will survive the
recession, but with scars.
The currency crisis, the depression of sales and bankruptcy of designers,
are results to be expected from the recession. However, stiff competition
from other luxury goods such as Dunhill and LVMH and the decision by
Japanese designers to withdraw from the Paris fashion scene will not leave
the French design industry unscathed. Such competition will benefit the
consumer. There will be a larger market of goods at reasonably affordable
prices, greater variety and better quality.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Shortages continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERIOD rates in the sterling cash market softened markedly yesterday morning
after the UK prime minister said that there would be a new emphasis on
'going for growth' in economic policy, writes James Blitz.
As the day progressed, however, shorter-dated maturities and 3-month money
firmed because of serious liquidity problems in the discount market.
On Tuesday night, Mr John Major said that a strategy for growth was what the
UK now needed. Dealers interpreted this as a sign that more base rate cuts
are likely: three month money fell to a low of 7 1/2 per cent on the offered
side, while the December short sterling contract rose 41 basis points to a
high of 93.47. At this level, the contract assumes that 3 month money will
be at around 6 1/2 per cent by the end of the year.
However, in the afternoon, continuing shortages in the sterling money market
forced shorter dated rates up again.
The Bank of England's forecast of a Pounds 2.05bn shortage was the latest
example of liquidity problems in the London market. A tax collection period
has started, creating shortages among the commercial banks.
The problem is compounded by the reluctance of dealers to sell bills because
they believe there could be another imminent cut in UK base rates. That
reluctance was characterised by a large figure of Pounds 665m for late
assistance yesterday.
One-month money yesterday closed a full percentage point higher than base
rate on the offered side. One-week money closed at 11 5/8 per cent offered,
while the 'overnight' rate peaked at 25 per cent during the day. One
clearing bank dealer said these market rates make the cost of funding
expensive for the clearers. His bank had met with Bank of England officials
to discuss the problem.
A second bearish influence on rates yesterday was disappointment that the
Bundesbank had conducted a net draining of funds in the German money market
after signalling on Tuesday that there would be a variable rate repurchase
agreement. The Bundesbank accepted all 'repo' bids made at the lowest rate
of 8.75 per cent, 15 basis points below than the previous one.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Bundesbank checks dollar rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR'S recent rise against the D-Mark was checked yesterday after the
Bundesbank's operations in the German money market signalled a smaller
easing in policy than had been expected, writes James Blitz.
On Tuesday, the Bundesbank caused excitement by saying that it would revert
to a variable rate repurchase agreement in its weekly money market
intervention, allowing the market some say in the cost at which it borrows
funds.
However yesterday's operation caused widespread disappointment. The
Bundesbank drained funds to the tune of DM2.7bn, and the accepted market
rate fell by only 15 basis points to 8.75 per cent.
The operation was accompanied by comments from Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a member
of the Bundesbank council, who said that the belief that interest rates
could only go lower was exaggerated. After peaking overnight in Asia at
1.5240, the dollar fell more than 1 1/2 pfennigs in Europe to close at
DM1.5070. The longer term outlook for the dollar is still disputed. The
gradual easing of German policy may soon be accompanied by higher interest
rates in the US, forcing the dollar up. Mr Bill Clinton's election as
President in a fortnight's time may bring public spending growth, and the
Federal Reserve could check this with tighter monetary policy.
However, Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said
that a Fed tightening of policy could be a more distant prospect than
expected because Mr Clinton's policies could not be in place before the
spring at the earliest.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London,
says the dollar will be weighed down next year by high US bond yields and
the possibility that the Fed will ease rates again after the election. In
his view, the market fails to realise that Mr Clinton, if elected, will
exacerbate the prime reason for dollar weakness: the US budget deficit.
Sterling was partly undermined by the Bundesbank's 'repo' operation, falling
nearly 4 pfennigs to close at DM2.4330. But the bulk of the fall was
triggered by the British prime minister's suggestion that his government had
opted for a policy of 'going for growth.'
However, Mr Neil Mackinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, believes
that sterling's weakness will be cushioned by similar cuts in German rates.
He sees a far sharper fall in the sterling/dollar rate, predicting a low of
Dollars 1.45 over the coming year.
Fears of a realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism at tomorrow's meeting
of the European Monetary Committee weakened ERM currencies against the
D-Mark earlier in the week. Those fears faded yesterday: the peseta closed
at Pta70.94 to the D-Mark from a previous Pta71.13.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Survey of Leman Region (2): Fraught with difficulties -
Infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite calls for a coherent regional transport strategy, co-ordination on
the ground is bedevilled by the existence of two different sets of national
laws and regulations, five regional governments and several independent
transport authorities.
Even co-operation between Geneva and its immediate neighbours on commuter
services for the city's 30,600 'frontaliers' is proving a slow and painful
process. Transport Publics Genevois (TPG), the Geneva public transport
authority, has just celebrated the opening of the very first cross-border
bus service linking the northern outskirts of Geneva with the Pays de Gex.
Previous attempts to establish cross-border operations have been stymied by
the refusal of both France and Switzerland to allow foreigners to practice
cabotage by picking up passengers en route, and by French reluctance to pick
up the subsidy tab.
The new line solves the cabotage problem by separate licensing on each side
of the frontier, while the TPG and the Department of Ain will pay a pro rata
subsidy for their share of the route. Mr Christoph Stucki, TPG director,
hopes this will set a precedent for other routes.
The SFr1.1bn light metro system planned for Geneva in 2005 could also be
extended into France at some future date, Mr Stucki says, but so far the
French authorities have been unwilling to commit themselves.
Cross-border commuting by train is also difficult. SNCF, the French railway,
runs the local network from Thonon and Evian as a feeder service for
France's mainline rail system and says commuter services into Geneva are not
a priority. To the north of the Leman there are no French commuter services
at all.
Co-ordination between Geneva and Vaud also leaves something to be desired.
The public transport authorities have not been able to agree even on common
ticketing arrangements, let alone an extension of the metro. Nor have the
two cantons resolved differences over building a third rail line between
Geneva and Lausanne.
These local difficulties are compounded on a regional level. The five
cantons and departments comprising the Conseil du Leman do not necessarily
see eye-to-eye on transport policy. Even when they do, there may be
practical obstacles to co-operation. The last word on railways and motorways
belongs to national governments. Finances are limited. Laws may prohibit
spending across boundaries.
A good example is the acknowledged need to improve road and rail links along
the south side of the Leman. Residents and businesses have been agitating
for years for a South Leman motorway (the Trans-Chablaisienne), and are even
prepared to finance the road privately.
The French authorities, which already have plans to upgrade the most
congested section of road between Thonon and Geneva, say the motorway would
be uneconomic. Environmentalists are also opposed. But a categoric refusal
by the Swiss government to guarantee extension of the Trans-Chablaisienne
into the Valais has dealt the project a possibly fatal blow.
Meanwhile, alternative plans to upgrade the railway along the southern shore
have been handicapped by the SNCF's lack of interest, even though the
Conseil du Leman has put up FFr4.6m to rehabilitate the 'Tonkin' line from
Evian running east to the Valais.
The absence of a high-quality transport network is clearly impairing
prospects for development on the French side of the lake. Poor connections
with the Haute-Savoie also hurt the Valais. Despite recent extension of the
motorway up the Rhone valley to Brig, at the foot of the Simplon pass
leading to Italy, the Valais has yet to overcome its relative isolation.
The economic benefits from the north-south transalpine rail tunnel to be
carved out under the Lotschberg peak to the north of Simplon will not be
felt until well into the next century. When they are, the effect may be to
draw the Valais closer to central rather than western Switzerland. The new
air service to Sion, the Valais capital, run by regional airline Crossair,
hops over the mountains to Zurich rather than down the valley to Geneva.
In contrast, the Swiss side of the Leman has excellent road and rail
communications but offers relatively few new development possibilities. Thus
interest has chiefly centred on extending the transport infrastructure
westwards, opening up the areas of France close to Geneva to the south
towards Annecy and to the west towards Lyon.
The final Jura section of the Geneva-Lyon motorway was opened two years ago
and completion of the Geneva link to Annecy and thence to Chambery and
Grenoble is planned for 1995. Linking the Swiss motorway system - and Geneva
airport - with the French will be the long-awaited Geneva ring road,
scheduled to open next June.
Meanwhile, the canton of Geneva and the Swiss government are pushing Paris
hard to secure an extension of the French TGV 'bullet train' network from
Macon north of Lyon to Geneva. This would cut the Geneva-Paris trip from 3
1/2 hours to 2 hours 10 minutes.
French and Swiss ministers agreed last month to accelerate studies on the
Geneva-Macon line with a view to making a decision next spring. But it is
clear that the line will not go ahead without a hefty financial contribution
from Switzerland, perhaps as much as two-thirds of the estimated FFr13bn it
will cost to build.
The French authorities are also considering a TGV line running south from
Geneva through Annecy and Chambery to Provence and Turin in Italy. This
would suit Annecy but not Geneva, from where 80 per cent of rail passengers
go north.
Also, although the Conseil du Leman backs the Geneva-Macon link, the canton
of Vaud has broken ranks by going ahead with feasibility studies on a
possible TGV spur direct to Lausanne from the projected Rhone-Rhine route
linking France and Germany.
The region is no better co-ordinated over air services. Cointrin, Geneva's
international airport, serves the entire Leman region, and there is direct
access to the airport from France. But the airport, which handled 5.6m
passengers last year, is financed and run by the canton alone, with some
financial help from the government in Berne.
Plans for further improvement of passenger and aircraft handling facilities
are being constrained by Geneva's budgetary problems. Meanwhile, although it
cannot match Geneva's international network, Cointrin's main rival -
Lyon-Satolas - is making a determined bid for regional pre-eminence. Talk of
co-operation between the two has so far resulted in a linking coach service
but little more.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Survey of Leman Region (3): Competition intensifies -
Banking and Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Geneva has long been a leading international financial centre, and still
ranks fourth after Tokyo, New York and London in terms of fund management
with Dollars 265.9bn under management at the end of last year, according to
a recent study by Technimetrics, the London investor relations research
group.
Competition is intensifying, however, and the city's financial leaders are
now enlisting help from all sides, including their neighbours, to maintain
the centre's dynamism.
The strongest pillar of Geneva's financial centre is international private
banking: managing the fortunes of rich individuals. By definition, a high
degree of discretion surrounds this business, but Geneva is generally
believed to be the world leader in it.
Chase Manhattan Private Bank, which is one of several non-Swiss banks to
have a significant presence in the city, estimates that wealthy individuals
have placed some Dollars 2,000bn in banks outside their home countries.
Banks in Switzerland hold more than a third of it, and Geneva banks more
than half of the Swiss total.
By contrast, commercial and investment banking activity has tended to
gravitate to Zurich although Geneva bankers suspect that they account for
rather more than 30 per cent of the value of the country's securities
transactions. That is the figure that has been used in assessing the Geneva
Stock Exchange's contribution to the costs of the national project to
develop an electronic securities trading system.
Signs of trouble with the competitiveness of the Swiss financial centre
emerged in the mid-1980s when liberalisation elsewhere suddenly made Swiss
practices look outdated and expensive.
The first steps towards liberalisation and rationalisation came in the late
1980s when a capital market syndication cartel was broken and in 1990 when a
consolidation of the country's seven stock exchanges into three was agreed.
Geneva benefited from both these changes. It was S. G. Warburg Soditic, a
Geneva house, that was the first and most aggressive bank to compete against
the old syndicate cartel. The closure of the Lausanne Stock Exchange made
Geneva's exchange effectively the national exchange for French-speaking
Switzerland.
Mr Jacques Treyvaud, chief executive of the Cantonal Bank of Vaud, was
immediately invited to join the board of the Geneva exchange and a new form
of collective membership was created so that all the former Lausanne Stock
Exchange members could have access to the Geneva ring.
'We very much want to put our structure and operations at the disposal of
other Romand cantons,' says Mr Thierry Lombard, vice-chairman of the
exchange.
The Geneva exchange itself is under threat of extinction as trading activity
concentrates in Zurich and London and the creation of a national electronic
exchange approaches. Bank Julius Baer, a leading Zurich private bank, has
withdrawn from the Geneva Exchange and Swiss Volksbank said it would give up
its membership this year.
In response, the exchange decided to open its membership to non-Swiss
bankers for the first time, inviting Mr Maurice Dwek, chairman of Warburg
Soditic, and Mr Pierre Dejardin-Verkinder, chief executive of Banque
Scandinave en Suisse, to join the board. Mr Claudio Generali, president of
the Lugano-based Banca del Gottardo, which is controlled by Sumitomo Bank of
Japan, also joined the board.
Its other initiative has been to create a foundation - Fondation Place
Financiere - to co-ordinate the efforts of all interested parties in the
promotion of Geneva as a financial centre.
Geneva's financial leaders say that even though there are more than 80 banks
in the city, there is very little sense of community such as one finds in
the City of London or on Wall Street. In large part, this is because each
bank tends to work on its own, managing its clients' funds and minding its
own business. As there is little capital market activity, there is little
occasion for banks to work together.
The foundation is an attempt to compensate for this atomisation, to bring
people from different types of banks together to work on improving the
city's financial centre.
Mr Lombard, who chairs the foundation, says promotion is the first function
of the foundation. 'We need to attract people who are willing to take risks;
who have a vision of the future,' he says. He wants to create an impression
that Geneva is an exciting financial centre where innovative bankers, such
as Mr Edmond Safra and Mr Edgar de Picciotto, come and build up successful
private banking businesses.
The foundation's other ambition is to make Geneva a recognised European
centre of financial education by creating an institute for studies in
financial analysis with pan-European recognition.
Although regional co-ordination in financial matters has intensified on the
Swiss side in recent years, there is still little cross-border financial
activity with the French departments of Haute Savoie and Ain.
The main element would probably be the accounts held by Swiss commercial
banks for many of the 30,000 French nationals who commute to work every day
in Geneva.
At the moment, the French national banks have very strong positions in these
markets and differences in legal systems have discouraged cross-border
activities. However, with the prospect of full recognition and mutual
acceptance of banking licenses coming into effect between Switzerland and
the European Community next year, there have been some recent moves.

FT  22 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Big gains in equities after policy
shift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FUNDAMENTAL shift in economic policy detailed on Tuesday evening by Mr
John Major, the UK prime minister, was the trigger for another burst of
enthusiastic buying in London's equity market.
The prime minister's new strategy - 'Growth is what we need; a strategy for
growth is what we are going to have' - gave an immediate shot in the arm to
a market already on the upward tack and looking for a series of Europe-wide
interest rate cuts.
The Footsie 100 index followed Tuesday's near-55 point jump with a further
improvement of 28.7 to 2,645.7. The latest rise in the market was
accompanied by a sharp surge in activity.
Equity turnover expanded rapidly yesterday, when over 850m shares changed
hands in the market. Dealers said that figure almost certainly would see the
value of customer business transacted in the equity market top the crucial
Pounds 1bn mark. Customer business on Tuesday, when the markets factored in
hopes of more cuts in interest rates, totalled Pounds 1.22bn.
The shift in strategy by the government coincided with a general round of
easing of monetary policy across Europe. The Bundesbank, as expected,
signalled an easing of policy yesterday by encouraging lower money market
rates, albeit by slightly less than some of the more optimistic market
observers had hoped.
Marketmakers, already wrong-footed by last week's sudden one-point reduction
in UK interest rates and the recent unexpected backing down over pit
closures, moved quickly to hoist share prices as the market opened.
The Footsie 100 index was up over 25 points within an hour and was driven
some 43 points higher at its best, in mid-morning, as UK and overseas
institutions, both piled into the market.
There was more good news for investors, with official retail sales figures
for September showing a better than expected rise of 0.2 per cent; the
general consensus in the market had been for a marginal decline in retail
sales over the month.
Cyclical stocks, including retailers, building materials and contractors,
properties and leisure stocks were keenly bought. But the utilities,
regarded as safe, defensive areas of the economy, attracted periodic bouts
of profit-taking and closed with widespread falls. Food retailers also
suffered, with at least two of the City's leading broking firms adopting a
cautious stance.
BP and Shell were given a rough ride after broker downgrades while Lloyds
Bank followed Barclays in being downgraded by market analysts.
A late bout of profit-taking in the equity market, caused by a lacklustre
performance by Wall Street, a slight decline in short sterling and the
sterling exchange rate, took the Footsie 100 off its best in the afternoon,
but dealers remain happy with the short and medium-term outlook for the
market. 'We'll see nothing more than small setbacks in the near-term,' said
the head of marketmaking at one UK securities house. Another market observer
said the fundamental change in the political and economic outlook could see
the Footsie challenge its all-time high of 2,744.5, achieved on May 11 this
year.

FT  22 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading

<TEXT>
CONTINUED expectations of a cut in UK base rates led to another strong
opening in Footsie futures though the lack of confirmation later dampened
enthusiasm, writes Joel Kibazo.
Trading in the December futures contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,685 and
the expectations on interest rates drove it sharply ahead to reach 2,705
around mid-morning.
The positive mood, however, gave way to caution which left December gently
falling back to the day's low of 2,675 just before lunchtime.
The contract then traded in a 30-point range of 2,675 and 2,695 for the rest
of the session with Wall Street having no impact on the day's activities.
Once again, the future traded at a strong premium to cash throughout the
session although dealers reported fewer opportunities for arbitrage
activity.
December ended at 2,696, up 39 on Wednesday's strong finish and around 29
points above its estimated fair value, the premium that takes into account
dividends and carrying costs. Fair value is estimated at around 23. Turnover
at over 12,000 contracts was very healthy.
Traded options were once again very active with volume reaching 39,021 lots.
The FT-SE 100 option traded 13,525 contracts while Lasmo was the most
actively dealt stock option, recording a total of 2,444 trades by the close,
and was followed by Asda at 1,823.

FT  22 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: GEC hit by broker sell advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY trading in GEC followed advice to take profits by investment bank
Kleinwort Benson. Shares in the defence and electronics group retreated 5 to
244p. More than 21m shares were traded, the second highest turnover this
year, as increasing worries over the outlook for the defence and power
engineering sectors found vent in the market.
Kleinwort's Mr James Dodd said: 'GEC has had an extraordinarily good run,
outperforming the market by 31 per cent over the past year, including 8 per
cent in the last quarter. The company is also cash rich, so it is hit by any
fall in interest rates. Its potential for growth is consequently limited.'
Mr Dodd added that there were a number of strategic uncertainties likely to
impinge on GEC in the near future. These included concern that UK defence
spending would be a prominent victim of public sector spending cuts.
In addition, a Democratic victory in the US presidential elections would hit
US defence spending. GEC would also suffer from any fallout from
rationalisation of the European Fighter Aircraft project, plus the potential
for delays to orders of gas-fired power stations in the light of recent
events.
Lloyds downgraded
Strong reports that a leading integrated securities house had chopped its
profit forecasts on Lloyds Bank caused a flurry of activity. The speculation
prompted the shares to tumble from a high of 352 and close a net 10 off at
324p with a hefty 10m shares traded, leaving the stock one of the weakest in
the Footsie 100.
Lloyds opened firmly in the morning, sharing in the general optimism within
the sector. However, during the afternoon, the market heard that SG Warburg
had taken a harsh view of the bank's prospects. Warburg was not prepared to
comment but institutional investors who had spoken to the house were saying
that it had slashed its 1992 forecast by Pounds 200m to Pounds 600m. This
would leave Warburg at the bottom of the range of estimates. The fact that
Lloyds is the quality play in the sector gave the change of view a greater
impact.
Shell switch
Shell Transport fell after one house argued that the benefits of recent
currency shifts were already in the price and investors should shift some of
their holdings into British Gas.
Hoare Govett's oil analyst, Mr Nick Antill, cut his 1993 net income forecast
for Shell to Pounds 2.85bn from Pounds 3.2bn and downgraded the stock to
'hold' from 'buy'. He said that D-Mark profits were likely to suffer in the
forthcoming year as were margins in the company's chemicals arm. The shares
fell 5 to 536p on turnover of 6.1m.
Mr Antill also argued that following the government's recent debacle over
British Coal, it might take a softer line on privatised utilities and
British Gas was looking more attractive. Gas rose 4 1/2 to 261p on turnover
of 7.6m.
The Hoare note also reviewed prospects for BP, Burmah and Calor as a result
of the deteriorating economic conditions. BP slipped 3 to 233 1/2 p on heavy
turnover of 10m shares. Burmah lifted 7 to 6741p and Calor improved 9 to
214p.
Builders strong
The property, housebuilding and materials suppliers sectors were the day's
strongest performers as investors seized on the likelihood of further
interest rate cuts as evidence that the sectors were destined for sustained
recovery. There were some spectacular gains, of which RMC stood out rising
44 to 448p, benefiting from both German and UK interest rate hopes. The
group derives 45 per cent of its business from Germany. Among other
materials groups, Meyer International gained 24 to 225p, Marley 9 to 80p,
and Redland 24 to 347p. Strong housebuilders included AMEC, 11 firmer at
75p, Barratt 9 at 73, and Wimpey 11 to 106p. Among property groups, MEPC
rose 28 to 308p, Great Portland 17 to 115p, Hammerson 25 to 226p and Land
Securities 16 to 431p.
However, analysts cautioned that the rises were probably not sustainable in
the short term. Even if interest rates were to be cut again, the lack of
confidence among potential house buyers was such that recovery would be a
long time coming. Mr Robert Donald at County NatWest said: 'House prices
have to stop falling before confidence can be restored to the sector. This
will take a lot longer than by simply cutting interest rates.' He added that
when recovery does come, with 1994 pencilled in considering the present
climate, he believed the pure housebuilders would be the ones best
positioned to benefit.
A shift in stance by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew on the food retailing sector held
back several stocks as the house moved from overweight to neutral. It also
moved from a hold to a sell on Argyll, steady at 358p, and Kwik Save, up 3
at 705p.
BZW downgraded Tesco, trimming Pounds 10m from this year's forecast to
Pounds 570m. Disappointing sales were said to be behind the downgrade. The
shares slipped a penny to 237p. Argos leapt 16 to 258p after being
recommended by SG Warburg.
Exploration and production group Lasmo added a further 12 at 188p on heavy
turnover of 6.3m shares. Investors are optimistic ahead of an Indonesian
seminar on natural gas set for early November.
The recovery story struck a strong chord in the leisure sector where dealers
reported chunky turnover and steady gains. Forte rose 7 to 164p in heavy
volume of 9.2m. Ladbroke 11 to 160p in 8.6m and Rank Organisation 18 to 548p
in 2.9m.
The rise of SmithKline Beecham slowed following Tuesday's solid
third-quarter figures. It closed 3 up 530p. Nikko Securities believes the
rating is up with events and was advising clients to switch into Wellcome,
which lifted 14 to 993p.
Aerospace and medical technology group Smith Industries jumped 21 to 329p,
boosted by an upbeat statement from the chairman as the company reported
profits in line with market expectations and a 5.1 per cent increase in the
final dividend. However, Smith New Court remains cautious on the outlook for
the next year and trimmed its previous profits estimate for the year to
August 1993 by Pounds 5m to Pounds 100m.
Airports group BAA was volatile. The stock moved 10 ahead to 763p early in
the day as a transport conference took place at County NatWest. But a sell
recommendation on the stock from UBS Phillips &amp; Drew sent it into retreat.
The securities house advised investors to 'top-slice' holdings due to
continued economic uncertainity. The shares closed 22 down at 731p. P&amp;O
jumped 20 to 428p as the company presented to institutions.
Worries over Reuters Holdings prompted traders to chop their prices in early
dealings. A number of analysts have been telling clients the stock is
overvalued and a lack of buyers yesterday morning saw the share price move
back more than 30p.
There was also nervousness ahead of an international conference scheduled
for today. Reuters chief executive Mr Peter Job is expected to talk to
analysts in the UK and US and is renowned for his rather downbeat approach.
The stock closed a net 23 off at 1213p on thin trade.
Guinness stood out in a strong drinks sector, the shares retreating 2 to
527p following disappointing figures from French group LVMH, which has a 24
per cent cross-holding with the UK company.
Insurers were strong performers as their solvency margins were boosted by
the rise in the market. Royal rose 18 to 209p and Sun Alliance improved 9 to
314p.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Survey of Leman Region (7): Trouble-free diversification /
Profile of Salomon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Leman region boasts, among other things, a very large concentration of
ski equipment manufacturers.
On the Swiss side is Authier, a specialist maker of alpine skis and
snowboards based at Biere, west of Lausanne, while Haute Savoie is home to
three well-known producers, Salomon, Dynastar and Lacroix.
If the border of the region was pushed as far south as Grenoble, Rossignol,
the world's largest supplier of alpine skis and parent company of Dynastar,
could be included as well.
It was in Annecy that Mr Georges Salomon invented the safety binding for
alpine skis in 1947, and the company that he formed there has since grown
steadily to become one of the world's leading suppliers of ski equipment and
one of the three largest industrial employers in the Haute Savoie
department.
A typically conservative family company, Salomon stuck to its specialisation
 -bindings - for more than 30 years, leading the market in technical
innovation and maintaining a dominant world market share, now about 44 per
cent.
In 1980, executives recognised that the ski business was maturing and there
was little more growth to be had from bindings. So they began a programme of
diversification.
Most industrial companies have difficulties with diversifications and
acquisitions, but Salomon's efforts have been remarkably trouble free to
date. There are two themes in Salomon's diversification programme -
extensions of existing product lines and entering markets with significant
innovations.
The first move - in 1980 - was the introduction of the rear-entry ski boot.
It became very popular because of the ease with which it could be put on and
taken off. It enabled Salomon in a short time to become the world's
second-largest alpine boot maker after Nordica of Italy, with a 20 per cent
market share.
The other prominent move was the group's acquisition in 1984 of Taylor Made,
then a small US maker of innovative golf clubs, known as metalwoods. They
perform the function normally done by clubs with wooden heads, but are made
entirely of metal. They are lighter than woods and perform better, and thus
have become very popular among professionals.
When Salomon bought it in 1984, Taylor Made had sales of about FFr70m and
was virtually unknown outside the US. Now it has sales of FFr800m all over
the world.
The Taylor Made acquisition also took Salomon away from winter sports for
the first time, something many winter sports equipment makers have attempted
in order to remove the seasonal concentration from their activities.
Two years ago, Salomon again entered an already mature and crowded market -
that for alpine skis - with an innovation. It made its skis from a single
mould rather than the conventional laminate of various high performance
materials. It has positioned the skis at the top end of the market and
claims to have taken a 20 per cent share of that segment. This year, it is
aiming to sell 200,000 pairs, enough to reach break-even on the project.
Other diversifications have seen the company move into bindings and boots
for cross-country skis and, more recently, walking and hiking shoes. In
response to a market trend, it has also belatedly introduced a conventional
front-entry alpine ski boot.
The result of this programme has been to create a much more balanced
enterprise than Salomon was in the late 1970s. Of the group's total sales of
FFr3bn in the year to March 31, 1992, some 60 per cent came from alpine ski
equipment and 27 per cent from golf equipment. Sales were spread remarkably
evenly among the main geographical markets, with 27 per cent in North
America, 36 per cent in Japan, and most of the rest in Europe.
Although less than 8 per cent of group sales were in France, the group has
continued to concentrate most of its manufacturing - except for golf
equipment, hiking boots and branded accessories, such as rucksacks  - in the
Annecy area.
It has seven factories in the area, employing some 1,700 people. In
addition, most of its sub-contractors are in the Leman region. Precision
parts come from the Arve valley specialists, plastic moulds from Oyonnax in
Ain, and a score of small manufacturers in and around Annecy make finished
products for Salomon.
'The advantage of being here is that we are very close to the ski resorts,'
says Ms Anne-Marie Berrette, group secretary. 'Everyone here is a skier and
we try to keep aware of customer needs.'
Group executives tend to use Geneva's Cointrin airport for their
international travel, finding it more convenient and with more connections
than Lyon's airport.
Salomon became a quoted company in 1983 but the Salomon family still holds
40 per cent of the shares and a majority of the voting power. The group's
financial performance was strong until 1989 when a combination of a paucity
of snow in Europe and a depressed golf equipment market hurt sales and sent
the group into its first losses, totalling FFr91m.
The following year, the loss increased to FFr257m as the weakening of the
yen and the US dollar added to the group's problems.
A rationalisation programme was carried out in 1990, eliminating 380 jobs in
France and 600 abroad. One of the seven factories in the Annecy area - which
made golf clubs - was shut down.
Last year, thanks to good skiing conditions around the world, sales bounced
back, rising 13 per cent, and a net income of SFr66m was recorded.
Salomon expects the consolidation trend in the winter sports industry, which
has been apparent for the past three or four years, will continue. The group
has a strong balance sheet, and is open to the possibility of making
acquisitions, although none are planned at the moment.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Survey of Leman Region (1): Co-operation is the key -
Advocates of European unity are promoting regional identities. But
co-operation is easier said than accomplished between entities as
structurally and temperamentally different as those of Switzerland and
France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the most cherished strategies of the advocates of European unity is
to promote what they call the Europe of the regions.
The idea is to focus on those many regions in continental Europe where
shared culture, history and traditions cross national boundaries. By
encouraging people to have a greater sense of identity with their natural
region, it is hoped that the importance of national borders will gradually
diminish in their minds.
Switzerland, by virtue of its position as the meeting point of three of
western Europe's great cultures, is participating in attempts to build four
of these trans-border natural regions. The two most advanced are the
tri-national area around Basle, known increasingly as Regio Basiliensis, and
the bi-national region radiating out from Geneva, which is coming to be
known as La Region lemanique after the beautiful lake that is at its heart.
It is, of course, ironic that the Swiss, who have tried so hard for
centuries to stand aloof from their neighbours' struggles and who harbour
deep doubts about the very notion of European unification, are embracing
these attempts to promote regional identity with some enthusiasm.
But the main promoters of a Leman regional consciousness are the Swiss -
notably Mr Raymond Deferr, deputy governor of the Swiss canton of Valais,
and Mr Claude Haegi, minister of the interior, agriculture and regional
affairs in the canton of Geneva.
Mr Deferr was instrumental in setting up the Conseil du Leman five years
ago, an organisation bringing together leaders of the Swiss cantons of
Valais, Vaud and Geneva and the French departments of Haute-Savoie and Ain.
He is now its president.
Mr Haegi has launched an unprecedented project of joint regional planning
with the French regional government of Rhone-Alpes.
In the past, there were close links among the French- and Italian-speaking
peoples who lived in the western Alps, the House of Savoy ruling various
parts of the region from the 11th century until the end of the Second World
War.
Industrially, too, contacts reach back at least into the last century when
the precision components manufacturers of the Arve valley in Haute-Savoie
served the watch and clock makers of Geneva.
The city of Calvin, surrounded by France except for a narrow corridor
connecting it to the rest of Switzerland, has had access since 1815 to large
tracts of land known as 'zones franches', or free zones, in adjacent
Haute-Savoie and Ain from where it obtained food and building materials -
and where it sent much of its rubbish.
These zones and natural contacts contracted dramatically in the first half
of the 20th century, largely as a result of Switzerland's neutrality through
two world wars. Today, the economies of the various parts of the region have
very few links. 'We have more trade with Hong Kong than we do with
Haute-Savoie', says Mr Steven Bernard an economist at the Geneva Chamber of
Commerce and Industry.
The main link is the group of some 30,000 people who live in France but
commute to Geneva to work every day. The sheer size of this group has
created endless problems for governments on both sides of the border and has
gradually forced them to recognise the need for co-operative planning,
construction and use of infrastructure.
But co-operation is easier said than accomplished between entities as
structurally and temperamentally different as France and Switzerland. Swiss
cantons have a high level of autonomy and their leaders are accustomed to
making decisions. In France, everything has to be referred to Paris. As is
often said of the US and Britain, they seem to be two cultures separated by
the same language.
In the early 1970s, Geneva recognised that its neighbouring French
municipalities, which were basically dormitory towns, were having a great
deal of difficulty providing services because most of their residents were
earning their living and paying taxes in the city. Geneva authorities
proposed transferring a portion of these taxes to the municipalities, but
agreement was delayed for a long time because the national French government
insisted that the money be routed through Paris and refused to guarantee
that it would be passed on to the municipalities concerned.
Today, cross-border co-operation in what might be called the metropolitan
Geneva area is becoming more productive. In addition to the tax treaty,
cross-border public transport is improving as is co-ordination of emergency
and security services and facilities.
However, even at this local level, there are conflicts. The departmental
government of Haute-Savoie in Annecy has long neglected the area it calls
'Le Genevois francais', but a few years ago it responded to demands from the
area to do something to ease its dependence on Geneva.
At the time, Geneva itself was bulging at the seams and reluctant to take in
any more foreigners, so the prospects for satellite developments seemed
good. Today, however, the climate has changed radically and Geneva, with
10,000 people unemployed and an office glut, is aggressively seeking inward
investment.
This unexpected competition, combined with the general economic recession,
has made life much tougher for the plethora of industrial and technoparks
that have sprung up in the Genevois francais. The most ambitious, the
International Business Park in Archamps, has just managed to save one of its
showcase building complexes from bankruptcy.
Efforts aimed at wider regional co-operation are still in their early stages
and, perhaps inevitably, have spawned conflicting agencies with conflicting
powers and interests. Le Conseil du Leman, for example, groups the three
cantons and two departments but excludes the powerful Rhone-Alpes regional
government.
Rhone-Alpes, representing the French national government, has a formal
relationship with the canton of Geneva, but not with the other Swiss
cantons.
These differences come to the fore on particular issues. The Conseil du
Leman, for example, is a big booster of a high speed train link between
Geneva and Paris.
The Rhone-Alpes government, centred in Lyon, puts priority on building a
line from Lyon to Turin to help slow-growth areas in southern parts of its
territory.
Indeed, the Lyonnais wonder how serious Geneva's commitment to the region is
when it seems that the thing it wants most from the French is a fast train
to Paris.
Similarly, the Swiss want a new motorway built along the south shore of the
Leman in France because the existing north shore motorway is saturated.
Officials in Lyon make clear such a project is of little interest to them,
and presents considerable engineering and environmental problems at the east
of the lake where the mountains rise straight up from the lake shore.
Viewed from Lyon, the region lemanique does not make much sense at all. 'It
is a geographical region - that is, the upper Rhone watershed - rather than
a natural economic one,' Mr Jean-Jacques Faure, a researcher in the regional
government, says
What they would really like is for Geneva to play a role in their
development plan, which envisages a triangular pattern with Lyon, Grenoble
and Geneva at the points.
Each point should become a regional centre of excellence in various high
technology and scientific fields, they argue.
It would be wrong to imply a degree of animosity in these differences. It is
just that the French, who have long seen themselves as the poor cousins in
the region, now realise they have some cards to play.
Everyone knows that the creation of the European Economic Area (EEA) next
year - provided Swiss voters ratify the treaty creating it in a December
referendum - will increase the permeability of the border, and that will add
to the need for close co-ordination at all levels.
All sides now want to co-operate and are doing so. The canton of Geneva and
the Rhone-Alpes regional government have just agreed to sit down to try and
draw up a common development plan.
The members of the Conseil du Leman have underwritten the cost of reviving
an abandoned rail line on the south shore of the lake.
'Our first task was just to get to know each other. Now we have to move on
to concerted action,' says Mr Deferr.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Search for a balance of power: A review of Britain's energy
policy must overcome past mistakes and economic constraints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tumultuous events have forced the government to launch a review of UK energy
policy only days after it tried to shut down half of the coal industry. But
as Mr Michael Heseltine, the president of the Board of Trade, sets about his
task he must already know that it is deeply unenviable. Few, if any, of the
possible courses of action before him are free of pain, and none are without
a heavy financial cost.
Set against the background of the UK's deeply depressed economy and the
Treasury's tight constraints on public spending, whatever answers he does
come up with will be heavily tinged by the short-term view. This augurs
badly for an industry in which time scales are measured in decades. It is
bound to go against the thrust of the government's own free market policies.
Not that Mr Heseltine has a shortage of options. As the most fuel-rich
country in Europe, the UK has the flexibility to develop an energy balance
from a wide range of sources: coal, gas, oil, nuclear, even - given the
British Isles' long coastline - wind and tidal power.
But that is not the only balance to be struck. If reversing some of the pit
closures means keeping open uneconomic mines, Mr Heseltine will also have to
decide how the extra costs are to be paid for. Will they fall on the
taxpayer, or the consumer of electricity? If the answer requires
intervention from on high, how is that to be squared with the government's
commitment to a free market? And how far can it tinker with one element of
the tightly interlinked energy balance without upsetting all the others?
Mr Heseltine's difficulties have a long history. Some of them stem from past
mistakes, such as the decision in the 1960s to develop a nuclear power
industry using the wrong technology, or a tendency to build unnecessary
power stations in order to meet a short-term expedient. But many of them
also relate to the government's own attempts to create a competitive market,
a process which still has some way to go and has accumulated its own errors.
Today, the UK has an energy market where only one fuel - oil - is relatively
free. Gas is becoming freer since privatisation and is finding a new role as
a power generation fuel, though the monopoly of British Gas remains a fact
of life in much of the market.
Electricity, privatised two years ago, is a duopoly of generators plus a
string of regional monopolies where the barriers to full competition will
only be removed in stages up to 1998. Nuclear power receives more than
Pounds 1bn a year in subsidies, but the government plans to review its
future in 1994, and phase the subsidies out by 1998.
Coal also receives heavy subsidies, though in the form of artificially high
prices from the electricity industry rather than state hand-outs. The
government's original intention was to reduce coal to a commercially viable
size next year so that it could start supplying coal at competitive prices
and keep up the steady process of deregulation. If that process is now to be
slowed, it will have knock-on effects throughout the electricity industry,
in nuclear power, and also in gas.
Mr Heseltine's real challenge is to find a way of enlarging coal's share of
the market - or at least slowing its steady decline - in a way which causes
the least damage to other sectors, particularly the electricity industry.
But he will also want to keep alive the ultimate policy goal of a
competitive market.
The main reason for coal's steady decline is its high cost - and to some
extent its dirtiness. This means that coal's immediate future depends either
on subsidy, or on driving out fuels which are even more expensive, or on
inhibiting competition from cheaper sources of power. It also means
compromises on the environmental front - which may be the easiest aspect to
the problem given the low place which greenery holds on the political agenda
in a recession.
The power industry is already buzzing with possibilities. A relatively easy
step would be for Mr Heseltine to delay the next stage in the deregulation
of the electricity industry.
At the moment, the market has two tiers: the 'free' market for large
customers using over 1MW of power a year where any supplier can compete, and
the franchise market which is the monopoly of the regional distributors, and
where most coal-based power is sold. In 1994, the threshold of the free
market is due to be lowered to 100KW - effectively extending it from the
country's 5,000 largest customers to the next 50,000.
By preserving the present structure Mr Heseltine would create more long-term
certainty, and give the regional distributors a reason to commit themselves
to buy more coal-based electricity. By one power industry estimate, he could
raise coal demand by 8m tonnes a year, enough to keep eight pits open and
save 8,000 of the 30,000 jobs at risk.
The beauty from Mr Heseltine's point of view is that the cost of this would
be hidden in higher-than-necessary household electricity bills. But it would
require him to intervene with Prof Stephen Littlechild, the electricity
market regulator, and postpone the deregulatory process, something that
could harm the electricity industry as well as the consumer.
'Competition has entered the market, and is here to stay,' said Mr Ed
Wallis, the chief executive of PowerGen yesterday. 'We would rather have
competition than direct regulatory direction.'
A further possibility would be to accelerate the retirement of the UK's
older nuclear reactors. Nuclear has grown rapidly to 20 per cent of the
market and has the advantage of not producing emissions. But it is a
loss-making industry, and for consistency's sake should be subjected to the
same discipline as coal. Closing the old reactors would create space in the
market for about 9m tonnes of coal a year at the cost of relatively few
jobs. However the substantial decommissioning costs would have to be borne
by the Treasury and would be less easy to hide. Again, it would mean
interfering with the timetable and pre-empting the long-promised 1994
nuclear review.
Although many of the problems which are currently facing the coal industry
have been blamed on the 'dash for gas' by power generators, Mr Heseltine's
ability to call a halt to this trend is limited. For one thing, the true
competitive position of gas vis-a-vis coal is hard to ascertain because the
crucial figures are closely held commercial secrets, and the case for
halting it is far from proven. Short of revoking licences for new gas power
stations, his only course of action is to intervene once again with Prof
Littlechild to enforce the electricity companies' obligations to buy power
at the best possible price. Even then, Prof Littlechild could not order the
closure of the gas stations; he could only penalise companies for using
them.
The outcome of all of this is bound to be a compromise which will save some
miners' jobs at the cost of higher tax or electricity bills. But the
exercise will not have been entirely futile if it brings greater clarity to
some of the more fundamental issues which are involved in UK energy policy.
It is already clear, for example, that trying to create a free market in
energy - one area where the UK is a world leader - is much less simple than
the government thought when it embarked on the exercise in the late 1980s.
Mr Michael Grubb, an energy expert at the Royal Institute for International
Affairs, said yesterday: 'The whole debate shows that energy cannot be
treated as an area where government has no role. It is too regulated, too
strategic, too close to the national interest.'
The two most unwelcome results of deregulation have been a surge in power
station construction to the point where the UK could have 30 per cent more
capacity than it needs, and a sharp rise in fuel imports. These both have a
similar cause: the private sector managements were unhappy with the
structure of the state-owned businesses which they inherited. They are now
taking solutions into their own hands by importing cheaper fuels than the UK
can produce itself, and developing their own power sources.
Is this the price of change, or should government take a stronger leading
role? Mr Patrick Lane of Oxford Economic Research Associates believes that
it is the inevitable result of 'holding back the water' in the energy
business. But these trends look worrying to many people and will strengthen
the case for more central direction.
Among those pressing for a more active government role are two leading
academic energy specialists, Nigel Lucas and Ian Fells, who called in a
report yesterday for the creation of an Energy Commission to assign
responsibility for planning electricity capacity and choosing fuels. They
argue for an energy policy driven by wider considerations: for example,
greater use of coal by power stations where the environmental effects can be
localised, and saving gas for other uses.
On the other hand, recent events have rekindled memories among older power
industry hands of the damage done by earlier government interventions - the
very events which gave Britain an inefficient power industry and provided
the impetus to the privatisation drive. Indeed, Mr Heseltine's efforts to
save miners' jobs may have wide public support, but they could well
introduce fresh distortions into the energy market.
'The old employment-led energy policy is reasserting itself,' says Mr
Jonathan Stern, a specialist in the gas industry. 'Keeping people in work is
a worthy aim, but I thought that the whole ethos had changed.'
Perhaps Mr Heseltine's strongest justification for trying to influence the
energy balance would be if he could come up with a good long term case for
coal. The national interest argument is certainly strong, and environmental
objections can be eased with promises of major advances in clean coal
technology. But the economic currents running in coal's favour are not
strong, at least in Europe, because of cost and the emergence of more
attractive alternatives.
'Coal is a declining fuel throughout the western world, and will continue to
be so,' says Mr Grubb. To challenge this view Mr Heseltine would have to
abandon his own claim that the economic case against coal is 'unanswerable',
and that seems most unlikely.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major goes for growth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC RECOVERY is not just around the corner. That fact, at least,
appears finally to have been acknowledged by the government. But does Mr
John Major's apparent late afternoon conversion to growth-oriented economic
management represent a shift in policy or a presentational stunt before
yesterday's parliamentary debate? And if policy is changing, will it change
in a way which promotes sustained non-inflationary growth rather than yet
another boom-bust cycle? The government has realised it needs a strategy.
But it still has not got one.
Mr Major's shift in focus from the threat of inflation to the dangers of
deflation was a well executed piece of political management. 'Most people
today,' the prime minister said on Tuesday's TV news, 'believe it is right
to look at a strategy that will bring recovery, bring growth and put back in
work those of our fellow citizens who are not in work.' In a sentence, Mr
Major encapsulated the national mood.
Yet his words, while strong on aspiration, were bare of detail. The Treasury
spent yesterday explaining that policy has not, in fact, changed. The
government remains committed to achieving low inflationary growth. The next
interest rate cut will come 'only when it is safe to do so'.
Mr Major clearly has some additional ideas. He hinted on Tuesday at the need
for increased capital spending on infrastructure, a ceiling on public sector
wages in order to retain the impression of a tough public spending round
and, most important, lower interest rates soon. Yesterday's stock market
rally, the pound's slide, and an initial fall in interest rate futures, all
suggest the markets are expecting interest rates to fall further.
Politically, Mr Major's change of emphasis makes sense. The prospect of
returning to the subject of colliery closures in the new year and driving
the Maastricht treaty through Parliament this year against a recessionary
background is as dismal as could be. In any case, the economy needs lower
interest rates: retail sales in September were flat while recent bleak news
from the corporate sector and bad debts in the banking industry mean the
squeeze will get worse before it gets better, regardless of any actions the
government takes.
Yet large rate cuts now outside a credible and transparent institutional and
policy framework, carry very great risks that the same inflationary errors
will be made all over again.
Mr Major needs to do much more than merely acknowledge that the economy is
in trouble. He must also accept that the Treasury policymaking establishment
has failed and needs to be overhauled. For now, the Bank of England must be
asked to provide a detailed and independent monthly economic analysis.
The Treasury could then be relieved of its monetary policymaking powers to
concentrate on the equally important task of restoring order to fiscal
policy. More capital spending is desirable. But overall, a looser monetary
policy should be balanced by fiscal tightening.
In short, the government needs a crafted reform package rather than policy
fragments delivered in TV soundbites. Britain needs policies which can
deliver recovery now, while nurturing stable growth in the medium term. It
does not need an ill-judged dash for growth followed by yet another damaging
recession.

The Ultimate Advantage. Creating the High-Involvement Organization By Edward
E. Lawler III Maxwell Macmillan Pounds 20.95
In the days before its industry was deregulated in 1980, America's Union
Pacific Railroad was a byword for bureaucracy. It then slid rapidly into
dire competitive and financial straits. New leadership took over in 1986,
dedicated to that holy grail of modern management: keeping costs minimal,
yet providing fast, high-quality service. It has since staged a remarkable
six-year recovery, with the help of just one-third the number of management
layers: three instead of nine.
Union Pacific is one of a growing band of American corporate practitioners
of what is becoming known as 'high involvement'. This is the latest term
coined to describe what is, in effect, the principle of 'subsidiarity' as
applied to business management: the pushing down, to the lowest possible
level in an organisation, of knowledge, information, and responsibility for
decisions and performance - together with performance-related rewards.
The coincidence of a shallow hierarchy and high involvement at Union Pacific
is really no coincidence at all. For low-overhead, shallow organisations can
only operate effectively if responsibility for many decisions is borne far
more by the people most closely associated with their effects than has been
traditional in most large American companies, that is, by middle-level and
low-level employees.
That message has been promulgated with growing noise and effect in the past
few years by many American academics and consultants. But many managements
have still been left wondering precisely what steps they should take to turn
concept into reality.
That is the main contribution of this addition to the literature, by a
long-established specialist in psychology, organisational behaviour and pay
who, as director of a California university's Center for Effective
Organisations, has had a considerable impact on the structures and
motivation systems of leading US companies, including Hewlett-Packard and
Digital Equipment.
Edward Lawler took the title for his book from the idea, increasingly
popular in the US and especially Japan, that traditional sources of
competitive advantage - location, access to markets and availability of
capital and technology - are unlikely to prove sufficient on their own
because of their near-universal availability to global companies. Instead,
management and organisational style, which because of their 'softness' are
much harder to emulate and implement effectively, may be 'the ultimate
advantage'.
The book covers the gamut of organisational issues, from overall corporate
structures to the design of work for individuals and teams, and from
information systems to personnel and human resources practices. Among other
things, it argues that high-involvement organisations operate best with pay
that is based on skill rather than rank, and with performance-related
approaches that emphasise teamwork and collective responsibility. Examples
include Digital, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Motorola.
Apart from its degree of practical detail, one of the strengths of Lawler's
book is its readiness to confront directly the sort of questions that really
worry most top managers about allowing their subordinates more knowledge,
information, power and rewards. He claims that power is not a finite
quantity - a fixed pie to be divided up - but that it can be expanded.
He also advocates the idea, familiar to observers of Japanese management,
that top executives who involve others in decision-making enhance their own
power by increasing the speed and effectiveness with which decisions are
implemented.
To readers in northern Europe, used to the less autocratic style of the
leaders of some local companies, Lawler may seem to be indulging in
hyperbole at times - using a sledgehammer to crack an obviously hard
American nut - when he advocates 'high involvement'. In parts of Europe,
unlike the US (and France), consensus decision-making is by no means
confined to the leading edge of companies.
Lawler's reply would be that it is all too easy to underestimate the sort of
structural, attitudinal and process changes which an organisation needs to
introduce if it wants really to harness the enterprise of all its employees.
Europeans may also feel that he overstates his argument that 'high
involvement' is competitive with the doctrine of Total Quality Management,
which has probably gripped more western companies in recent years than any
other management concept.
Although the total quality approach stresses employee involvement, Lawler
claims this is limited 'to allowing employees to make suggestions and
control certain elements of the production and quality control processes'.
Thus an organisation using the total quality approach can often remain
hierarchical, he says.
Yet this does not apply to several of the quality programmes which he cites
himself at companies that have also embarked on high involvement, such as
Motorola and Xerox. In principle, the two approaches are not incompatible.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Phoning Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN businesses and consumers pay a heavy price for the continent's
fragmented and cartelised telecommunications market. The heaviest burden is
the excessive price of cross-border telephone calls, which are about three
to six times as expensive as calls of the same distance within the unified
and competitive US market.
It is therefore refreshing that the European Commission has in its sights
the monopolistic practices that underpin these excessive prices. In a
consultative document published yesterday, it argues that the market for
cross-border calls within the Community should be opened up to competition.
Given the concern throughout Europe over the Commission's high-handedness on
a range of matters in the past, it is clearly sensible to have a thorough
public consultation before reaching a final decision. But the Commission is
also right to give a firm lead that liberalisation should be the way
forward. Telephone call charges are too high because most European countries
have only one telephone company, while profits from international calls have
traditionally been used to subsidise local calls.
The Commission paper sets out four options. The first - maintaining the
status quo - is rejected because it would not address the problem. The
second - regulating prices directly - is viewed as excessively
interventionist. The remaining options are to liberalise only the market for
cross-border calls or to open up the whole market.
Economically, the case for full-blooded liberalisation is compelling. Europe
suffers not only from higher cross-border call charges than the US, but also
from higher domestic tariffs and a less innovative market in the development
of services.
However, politically, the Commission is wise to limit its action to
cross-border liberalisation. If the principle of subsidiarity is to be taken
seriously, as it must, there is a strong argument that member states should
be left to decide for themselves how far to open up telecommunications
within their borders. But, when it comes to crossing frontiers, it is clear
that only the Commission has the competence to act. It should do so
vigorously.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Aid matters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THINGS are going badly, householders kick the cat and chancellors the
overseas aid budget. There is thus a depressing predictability about the
leaks, which began last month, that the Treasury is looking for a 15 per
cent cut (about Pounds 250m) in Britain's aid budget over the next three
years. Since some 40 per cent of the total is already committed in foreign
currencies through the European Development Fund and other multilateral
agencies, and has therefore just been sharply increased as expressed in
sterling, this would imply an even bigger cut in the bilateral aid
programmes which are often the most imaginative.
The reaction has been equally predictable. Churches and charities have
rushed to the defence of a budget whose inadequacy they are usually the
first to point out. More significant, in the light of recent events, is the
fact that 33 Tory MPs signed an advertisement opposing the cuts.
Certainly the proposed cuts would be hard to reconcile with earlier pledges
of an increase, notably in the Conservative election manifesto and in the
prime minister's speech to the Rio earth summit.
The position of Baroness Chalker, the overseas development minister, will be
very unenviable if the cuts go through. And her colleagues defending the
Maastricht treaty 'line by line' in the House of Commons might suffer some
embarrassment when they reach Article 130 U, dealing with co-operation and
development policy. In that article the EC and its member states promise to
respect the undertakings and objectives they have accepted in the UN
framework: an allusion to the long-declared aim of industrialised countries
to raise aid disbursements to 0.7 per cent of their annual gross national
product. In reality, the UK has slipped from 0.51 per cent in 1979 to 0.28
per cent this year, and these cuts would take it lower still.
What is curious about this depressing argument is that all parties to it
agree that aid flows are a mere drop in the ocean in their effect on
long-term development compared with the damage done by tariff and non-tariff
barriers to south-north trade. The overall cost of northern protectionism to
third world exporters is estimated at about Dollars 100bn a year, without
counting the damage done through unfair competition from subsidised northern
food exports. Developing countries are constantly urged to earn their way
out of debt and poverty through exports. Yet when they add value to their
products before exporting them (for instance, by turning cocoa beans into
powder) they run into a much higher tariff wall.
Particular culprits are the multifibre arrangement and the EC's common
agricultural policy. Reforms in both are frequently promised, but those that
would actually help third world imports are constantly postponed - the
current excuse being the need to resolve north-north arguments in the
Uruguay Round first.
If Britain could use its EC presidency to break this logjam, those concerned
with third world development might forgive the small-minded cuts the
government is thinking of making in its inadequate aid budget.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Arts: Front-line dispatch from the sex war - Cinema

HUSBANDS AND WIVES (15) Lumiere, Screen on the Green
1942: CONQUEST OF PARADISE (15) Empire
PRAGUE (12) MGM Trocadere, Minema
BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER (12) MGM Panton St
The weightier a movie, the swifter it sometimes sinks. In America Woody
Allen's Husbands And Wives and Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest Of Paradise -
two of the decade's best films to date - are going down fast at the box
office, gurgling 'Mayday' as the waves of audience indifference close over
them.
Both, one concludes, present discoveries that Mr and Mrs Average Filmgoer do
not want to know about. 1492 is about the way the New World discovered
Christopher Columbus soon after he discovered it. And in Husbands And Wives
we learn things about Woody Allen and his art that will disturb anyone still
thinking of him as Filmdom's bespectacled funster.
Not, heaven knows, that the media sages have not tried to dent that image.
Here, they have cried of this film, is the artist transcribing his own
crumbling romance with Mia Farrow in the tale of Gabe and Judy (Woody and
Mia), whose marriage begins to splinter soon after they hear that their best
friends (Sidney Pollack and Judy Davis) are separating. And look] Our
menopausal hero also falls in love with a girl old enough to be his daughter
(Juliette Lewis).
But five minutes into this film, who cares about the real-life parallels?
Allen himself, in a pre-emptive attack, sets about the old proverb in an
early scene: 'Life today doesn't imitate art, it imitates bad television.'
And Allen the director in Husbands And Wives takes a potentially
soap-operatic story and subjects it to the high-speed rinse-and-renew cycle.
The film combines a cine verite camera style with a fast and furious verismo
in the performances. This is not about Allen and his troubles; it is about
all of us and our troubles.
As the camera judders and pans around the chic New York sitting rooms, lives
strive to stay upright in the hurricane. Allen is a schoolteacher surveying
an intellectual age fast entering a new insanity (where theses abound with
titles like 'Oral sex in the age of deconstruction.') And Farrow is part
marital punchball, part restless matchmaker. She pushes best friend Davis
into the arms of architect hunk Liam Neeson, while Davis's own ex-mate
(played with eye-rolling mid-life anguish by director Sidney Pollack)
scampers after an airheaded aerobics teacher.
Love's labours are not just lost; they are hastened towards disaster as if
by a footballer dribbling towards his own goal. No Woody Allen film has had
such passion in its comedy. We rock with glee at the scene of dressed-up
Judy Davis taking time out to scream down a phone at adulterous Pollack
while a stupefied friend waits to escort her to the opera. And no Woody
Allen film has had such comedy in its passion. Watch the young Miss Lewis
dismembering the adoring Allen's self-esteem, as she takes apart his draft
novel in a taxi conversation. 'But I thought you admired it,' he finally
stammers. 'Well, Triumph Of The Will is a great movie, but . . .'
Husbands And Wives is a front-line dispatch from the sex war, complete with
bullet-holes, powder burns and tear-stains of helpless laughter. Styled like
an on-the-hoof documentary, its shuddering camera and straight-to-lens
monologues make recent Allen sex comedies like Alice seem tamely orthodox.
Better still, it shows that Allen the performer has grown far beyond the
schoolboy-in-shock phase of his early career. He is now an adult in shock,
wiser and sadder but no less hilarious. As Miss Lewis tells his would-be
writer in one of her few front-handed compliments: 'All this suffering and
you make it so funny.'
Those who do not learn from history, we are told, are condemned to repeat
it. But by what nightmare learning lapse has the cinema been condemned to
repeat the Columbus story three times this year? Perhaps it failed to learn
that anniversaries alone do not justify trotting out and re-trotting the
same chunk of Hispano-Hollywood hokum.
Ridley Scott's 1492: Conquest Of Paradise spends a dutiful hour going
through the usual stations of visionary heroism. Columbus (Gerard Depardieu)
the dreamer gazing at the sparkling sea; Columbus the rebel railing against
the Catholic church; Columbus the courtier spying friendship in Queen
Isabella (Sigourney Weaver); Columbus sailing through sunsets and near-miss
mutinies to the promised land.
We heave a sigh of relief when the feet finally stomp through the slo-mo
surf to land on the welcome mat of history. Is it over? Can we go?
No. For then the film begins. And in this glorious semi-apocryphal second
act Columbus-Depardieu, having bitten off his piece of the New World, is
rudely bitten back by it. His paradise island, with its Toytown of
half-built churches and government buildings, is battered by human storms
and natural hurricanes. And when his emergent slave culture tastes the blood
of rebellion, Paradise proves to be merely Hell turned a different way to
the light.
You might argue that other film-makers - Herzog in Fitzcarraldo, Saura in
Eldorado - have been here before. This is the coloniser colonised by his own
deliriums of power; the natives turned righteous avengers leaping from the
camouflaging wilderness. But with Scott going into the visual overdrive he
showed in Blade Runner and the underrated Legend, this film soon outpaces
its own pacesetters.
Every image has a painter's passion for organic, restless detail: billowing
smoke, flickering fires, the hieratic geometry of waving flags and banners.
And the sense of Nature biting back at Nurture crescendoes in a storm scene
choreographed with unforgettable force and simplicity: three goblets dancing
on a wooden table, a window-casing flung across a howling room, Columbus
pinioned to a wall by his own furniture, marching across the room as if
alive.
At the end of this scene Scott cuts to an image of peace and renewal no less
eerie than the maelstrom of destruction. A work party of ants carrying
sun-translucent green leaves trots across Columbus's floor in a sardonic,
Lilliputian parody of human endeavour.
Ridley Scott on this form - and in larger set pieces like the cathedral
scene with its giant incense-bearer swinging overhead like a demolition ball
of history - is the cinema's great decorative expressionist: a Von Sternberg
for our times. He should take a bow too for casting GD as CC. Depardieu's
protean grace as a performer - he looks like the Incredible Hulk, he moves
like Nijinski, he acts like Olivier - make this Columbus a hero, child and
visionary all in one. 1492, if not the last word on Columbus, is
definitively the last image.
There are few terrae incognitae left in the modern world, but Europe is one.
The continent featured in movies like Ian Sellar's Prague is a dark,
uncharted place populated by a tribe hitherto unknown to man. These are
Euro-actors: itinerant mummers like Bruno Ganz and Sandrine Bonnaire who
wander from one co-production to the next, swallowing the script and then
spewing it out in the lingo of the day.
In Prague the lingo is Runic English. A young Scot (Alan Cumming) comes to
the Czech capital to trace his grandparents, who died in World War 2. Old
newsreel footage may provide enlightenment, but not if film archivists Ganz
and Bonnaire can help it. They are - bring on the capital letters -
Mysterious Middle-Europeans. They play with the stranger, charm him, seduce
him, abandon him. And for why? God knows. Probably because film-maker Sellar
has seen too many Resnais and Antonioni films and thinks that is how people
behave sur le continent.
If Prague is mystification with thick accents, Buffy The Vampire Slayer is
drivel in Valleyspeak. Buffy (Kristy Swanson) is the high school cheerleader
picked for cross-and-stake duty by Donald Sutherland's 500-year-old vampire
operative. The film's idiocy is relieved only by the schoolgirls' spurts of
LA slang. I particularly liked 'What's the sitch?,' 'Get out of my facial'
and 'You're behaving like the Thing from another Tax Bracket.' Six out of
ten for scriptwriter Joss Whedon; one and a half and stay-in-after-class for
director Fran Rubel Kuzui.

Mel Smith and Griff Rhys Jones are undeniably successful comedians; their
programmes win high ratings and awards. Many of us find them very funny. But
shall we ever become as fond of them as our parents were of Morecambe and
Wise? It seems doubtful. Tonight they begin a new series of Smith And Jones
(9.35 BBC1) which, these days, serves largely as the showreel for their big
money making business which is in TV and radio commercials and training
films.
Thursdays are now packed with comedies, many of them repeats including As
Time Goes By (8.00 BBC1), one of those bittersweet, mumsy middle-aged series
with Judi Dench drenched in nostalgia. Rising Damp (8.30 C4), made in the
mid-seventies, is a goodish vehicle for Leonard Rossiter, who plays a grubby
landlord smitten with one of his tenants. Best of the lot is Waiting For God
(8.30 BBC1) with Graham Crowden and Stephanie Cole as a couple of
magnificently bolshie inmates of an old people's home. Last week's episode
of Bottom (9.00 BBC2) proved that some, anyway, of this second batch from
Rik Mayall and Adrian Edmondson is as madly inspired as 'The Young Ones'.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Arts: Kiss of the Spider Woman - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Some people may like Kiss of the Spider Woman. Since I did not, and so much
work has obviously gone into it, I shall try to make my remarks as objective
as possible in order not to undermine other people's pleasure.
It may be advisable not to sit too close to the front of the stalls. Spider
Woman is a very big musical, at least in its pretensions. The Shaftesbury
Theatre also has a large stage. The set is almost uniformly a prison with
metal bars, literally hundreds of them.
Yet the trouble with turning the stage into a prison is that you tend to
keep the audience out rather than invite them in. This is not a show full of
warmth.
There is a second motif in the spider's web. It has a similar effect to the
prison bars. This spider does not entice people in; it drives them away. It
is true that there is a smaller cell inside the larger prison. Here is where
the intimacy is supposed to take place.
The central relationship is between two prisoners, one a poor homosexual who
has been entrapped by a minor, the other a Marxist revolutionary familiar to
Latin American politics.
Gradually they become mutually dependent, eventually to like each other and
finally to embrace. The essential point of the relationship is that it is
micro and develops in a small space. It is anything but micro in Harold
Prince's production. Thus the main thrust of Manuel Puig's novel is lost.
Is anything valuable put in its place? The answer is no. There is a lot of
loud music by John Kander with lyrics (none of them memorable) by Fred Ebb.
Chita Rivera as the Spider Woman flits about much like the phantom in the
Opera.
At one stage there is a trip to what looks like the Brazilian jungle. The
Latin American police are shown to be crude in their methods. One of their
punishments consists of placing a metal bucket over a prisoner's head and
banging on it with metal rods.
There is also a touch of sentimentality. Molina, the homosexual prisoner, is
allowed to telephone his mother and does so with a song called 'Mama, It's
Me'.
The question I kept finding myself asking was why. What does the musical
treatment add to the story? The answer is worse than nothing; it detracts.
Spider Woman is a pastiche of the work of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and
Stephen Sondheim. It does not come off because it lacks a reason for
existence.
I also thought longingly of a couple of plays. If you want to see
homosexuality movingly portrayed on stage, remember Tony Kushner's Angels in
America at the National Theatre.
And if you want to explore brutality in Latin America, recall the treatment
in Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden. Throughout Spider Woman the latter
scarcely left my mind. Dorfman's piece is a low budget play which speaks
volumes. Spider Woman must have cost millions to ruin a story.
The one redeeming feature is Brent Carver as Molina. He acts, shows genuine
pain and genuine pleasure. He would be perfectly at home in Angels in
America. Here he is locked into a production unworthy of his talent.
The prison and the rest of the sets are designed by Jerome Sirlin.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Arts: Congreve's witty play about the ways of wit - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A witty play is a gem, but a witty play about the ways wit works within the
world is something far more luminous. Like Shakespeare, Moliere and Wilde -
and like Jane Austen - Congreve could not only relish wit but criticise it
too. In The Way of the World, he shows some characters who have wit without
sincerity, others who have sincerity without wit, and, in Millamant and
Mirabell, two who have wit and sincerity perfectly fused. They are as
ideally destined for each other as Beatrice and Benedick, or Lizzie and
Darcy.
One of the many pleasures of Peter Gill's new staging of this classic for
the Lyric, Hammersmith, is that he sets Millamant and Mirabell so perfectly
in relief. All around them are people who are funny without meaning to be
(Lady Wishfort, Sir Wilfull Witwoud), or people who try so hard to be funny
that they are themselves ridiculous (Witwoud, Petulant), or people whose
lives have rendered them serious (Mrs Fainall). But, to Millamant and
Mirabell, wit is as natural as breathing. And so is sincerity. Amidst a
little world brimful of plots, they scheme without malice. Against a parade
of modishness, they are fashionable without affectation.
They are critical of their world - and of each other. There are moments when
their attraction seems as hopeless as that of Moliere's Misanthrope and his
Celimene. As Millamant rejects him, she laughs and says 'What would you give
that you could help loving me?'; and he replies 'I would give something that
you did not know I could not help it.' With Jeremy Northam, the line is as
gravely moving as in Gielgud's famous recording of the scene. In voice and
stance, in every passing inflection, he has easy authority. Barbara Flynn is
equally natural in the even harder role of Mirabell. She is constantly -
enchantingly - capricious, yet without a scrap of artifice.
Everything that Sheila Hancock does as Lady Wishfort is amusingly perfect.
She looks like a wolfhound masquerading as a French poodle, her eyes blaze
out eagerly above her rouged cheeks, and her body language mixes posiness
and impulsiveness mixed in a brilliantly babbling stream. But, even as I
chuckled, something in her pacing made me feel that she had applied
everything from outside: disbelief was not suspended. As the fop Witwoud,
however, Tom Hollander carries off all his enchantingly silly prattle with
an amazing kind of innocence.
Eleanor David performs the sly Mrs Marwood with the perfect facade of mild
decorum, only in passing hints revealing her secret malice and corruption.
Though Jonathan Phillips paces about too busily as Fainall, he catches the
cruel rage at this character's heart; and Emma Piper conveys the brave
resignation and unspoken sadnesses of his wife. In a few economical shards,
Tom Piper's sets summon up different scenes of 1700 scenes and make them
beautiful.
The Way of the World is at the Lyric, Hammersmith, until 21 November.
In Monday's paper, our review of Carlo Bergonzi's farewell recital was
written by Alastair Macaulay, not David Murray. Our apologies.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Arts: The Brubeck beat falters - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The knowledge that Dave Brubeck was probably defying medical opinion to
appear at the Festival Hall earlier this week lent an unwelcome edge to his
performance. The quartet is a favourite and well tested format for the
pianist who almost single handedly commercialised jazz in the 1950s with
'Take Five'. He has a new album of old show tunes in the shops, Once when I
was very young, (Verve 844298-2) and a four CD retrospective, Time
Signatures, which reaches back to 1946, being made ready by Columbia.
It ought to have been the best possible time to be reminded of the 71 year
old's tidily overlaid arrangements and almost perverse way with the beat.
Instead, a fragile looking Brubeck, just out of hospital following heart
trouble, put a brave face on it and reluctantly let his sidemen take the
strain. Not that listening to the mature sound of long time collaborator
Bill Smith's clarinet and the redoubtable bass of Jack Six, cracked along by
Randy Jones's drums, is any great hardship. But it would have been
interesting to discover whether Brubeck was still resisting the conventional
swing thing and if he yet worked slowly and deliberately to his own
compositional conclusions.
In the circumstances the quartet, done up to the nines in djs, were obliged
to swing away from Brubeck with numbers old ('Shine on Harvest Moon'),
unusual (an unrealised opera excerpt, 'Softly William Softly') and the
familiar ('Take Five'). Bill Smith, who has accompanied Brubeck on and off
since the late 1940s, carried his faltering boss gracefully. A solo stint
which used reverb on the clarinet gave his sound an almost underwater
quality. Jack Six climbed energetically around the double bass and British
drummer Randy Jones worked harder than he probably has in a long time.
Yet in spite of his obvious frailty (he had cancelled Glasgow earlier in the
tour) and unease in accomplishing some of his ideas, Brubeck's curiously
interlocking interplay with the clarinet rose to the surface intermittently.
Later, with the appearance of cellist Matthew Brubeck, one of a large and
talented brood, on leave from the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, Brubeck
demonstrated that his cautiously structured technique can and does tap feet,
even in this temporarily careworn atmosphere.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Technology: Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Training often takes the part of Cinderella - languishing in the kitchen
while other, more fashionable, departments go to the high-tech ball. The
fairy godmother arrived in the 1980s, as managers finally saw staff as an
asset to be developed.
Training centres were much in vogue, although cynical observers saw them
more a means to acquire impressive country properties.
Recession sounded the stroke of midnight and pressure is now on to justify
continuing budgets and to
maximise existing resources.
At the TSB, investment in video technology has led to interesting spin-offs.
John Hodges, head of training, design and delivery at TSB Retail Banking and
Insurance, was approached by a number of school head teachers. As schools
were increasingly driven to develop a business-like approach, heads
recognised that they had no commercial training.
There are a number of parallels between the operations of a school and a
pharmacy - premises,
purchasing, stock and so on. Using the video system, Hodges produced a
course for head teachers.
TSB has used the video to evaluate the business sense of potential graduate
recruits.
Far too much money is spent by companies re-writing from scratch what they
already have. Programmers not only want to re-invent wheels but the concept
of transport itself. Hodges has ably demonstrated the cost savings of
adapting rather than originating.
The portability of the system has allowed it to be taken out beyond the
cloisters of the residential college. The goal is to keep learning as close
to the individuals as possible.
Hodges refers to the multimedia centre as a 'peripatetic learning centre'.
Effective monitoring also allows users to follow up with further training.
The TSB has blended leading-edge technology with a climate for learning. The
old sits happily alongside the new.

Software:  TSB Group's mulitmedia training courses use interactive videos
developed in-house entitled A Question of Business (1987) and A Case of
Disappearing Pills (1989).  A third video, a French course for schools, has
been sponsored by TSB Group Community Project. TSB RBI also uses published
programs such as Longman's Caring for Your Customer.
Hardware:  Eight Sony laser disk players in the TSB college; 12 IBM
286-based PCs.  Sony monitors on the PCs are able to display computer-
screen messages and video simultaneously.  There are 80 Sony view systems in
the TSB RBI centres.
Cost of project:  The original interactive video project in 1986 cost around
Pounds 50,000 including the casting, acting and filming, and the use of
various production consultants.  The initial investment in hardware for
running the videos (as opposed to developing them) amounted to Pounds
18,000.  About Pounds 30,000 was spent on contractor services.  Two college
employees worked full-time on the project but more were involved in the
research, interviewing and assessment.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Technology (Software At Work): Getting closer to the
customer - Continuing a series on software, Claire Gooding explains how the
TSB Group is using multimedia to develop and test its managers' financial
skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An energetic, middle-aged man enters the office and takes a seat on the
other side of the desk. He is wearing a casual jacket and sweater - unusual
for an MD seeing the bank manager - and his manner is brisk. 'I haven't much
time, I've got to get back to the shop,' he says.
His name is Richard Evans, and students on the TSB Group's management
courses get to know all about him and his plans to expand his high-street
pharmacies by diversifying into menswear.
Using a real company, its accounts, its staff and its dilemmas, TSB staff
can hone their skills using interactive video. In the same way that a flight
simulator gives the illusion of real interaction, multimedia techniques
provide a real 'customer' on the screen.
Saying yes (or no) to a potential borrower demands a blend of analysis and
judgment not easy to teach. The TSB Group Management College is using
multimedia techniques to develop and test its managers' financial skills in
a situation as close to real life as possible.
Students converse with Evans through the keyboard. They pose questions by
typing in certain words - for example, capital, assets, turnover. The
computer composes questions derived from these words, so avoiding the need
for keyboard skills.
The questions are selected from a list of 800 options. The user can comply
with a suggested question, or search for another. For computer-shy branch
managers (97 per cent have never used a keyboard before), the Y and N keys
are labelled clearly. Back comes the appropriate pre-recorded response from
Evans, complete with mannerisms and body language.
'It brings a subjective element into the classroom that just can't be
reproduced on paper,' comments Theresa Barnett, head of business
development.
Learning is a holistic experience at the college. The students are typically
managers of all age groups, resident for up to a week at a time. They are
encouraged to test and assess themselves, not only in the classroom. A
swimming pool and a supervised gymnasium lie on one side of the 1990s-style
cloister.
Multimedia techniques have brought a breath of real life into what used to
be largely paper-based exercises. As with studying a foreign language, the
real learning starts only when the theory is put into practice.
Real people, according to Barnett, were co-operative when it came to being
'guinea pigs' for her training courses. But, as she points out, there was a
limit to the number of times they could be asked to participate.
'These are busy people with businesses to run, and that's what they should
be doing. You can't have 12 people interviewing the same person, posing the
same questions over and again.'
Her solution, using multimedia techniques, was ingenious and cost-effective.
It drew on previous experience with video and paper-based exercises. 'We
researched a real business and put it into an interactive video.'
Evans is a real person, with genuine plans to take his chain of shops up
market. The process of researching, devising and scripting the dialectic
took six weeks. Every possible question had to be researched and its reply
recorded. Taking no chances, Barnett pressed six experts into service to
provide a broad spectrum of techniques. The thorniest job was to pare down
the answers into tight, pithy scripts which became the 'sound bites'
prompted by students.
The scripts are interpreted by an actor, who met the real-life protagonist
so that he could reproduce his mannerisms, turn of phrase and personality
faithfully.
Barnett emphasises that multimedia should not be seen as something new and
frightening, merely an evolution and amalgamation of familiar teaching
tools, consolidated by the use of the computer.
'Multimedia is a lot of things we already know about - sound, picture,
video, computer graphics and printouts - just connected. It's easier to have
multimedia on your desk rather than lots of different machines. It can go
with you wherever you are working.'
The next step came in 1988 when Barnett and her colleagues recognised that
they could 're-purpose' the interactive video. 'It occurred to us that we
could create a different program from the same video,' she explains. 'We
wrote a different piece of software and used the video as a database of
background information.'
The new video was fleshed out with CVs of other staff members, balance
sheets and forecasts in Lotus 123 spreadsheet format, and market research on
pharmacies, regulation, local competition and other factors.
Students could then do an open-ended SWOT analysis (Strengths Weaknesses
Opportunities Threats). The tutor could focus on any aspect: recruitment,
human resources or capitalisation.
There were savings on time and and cost in using the same source material,
but also spin-off benefits outside TSB, in an RBI project to educate
head-teachers about business principles.
When the real-life Evans visited the college to watch his impersonator in
action, everyone was intrigued to hear how his business had fared
subsequently. A fraud perpetrated by a fellow director had leached thousands
from the balance sheet, threatening the cashflow and shrinking stocks. The
result was a sequel video in 1989.
The exercise takes several hours, and is an entertaining mix of soap opera,
documentary, detective thriller and interactive Cluedo.
The student picks a route through evidence, drawing on resources such as
personnel records, appraisals, company accounts and legal tomes, all
available through the computer.
Role-playing as an investigator, the student can call other characters into
the multimedia office, and practise such tricky human situations as accusing
an accomplice of theft, firing an old friend and threatening legal action.
The dialogue is recorded and can then be edited, with the user reviewing his
own reactions. Unlike real life, the interviewer who feels he has made a
mess of any part of the dialogue can re-record the skirmish until he is
satisfied. The whole interview can be kept on compact disk for replay,
review and discussion.
The technique has proved popular with users. 'It's a first-class method of
learning,' comments one. 'It really brings the case studies to life, and it
allows delegates to trace their steps and actions stage by stage,' says
Wally Valentine, financial services manager.
Paul Turner, director of the college, takes a broad view of the benefits of
multimedia training. 'The organisation needs managers who match the
opportunity to sustain competitive advantage. We're using proven technology
to train them, although the application itself is new. Multimedia is an
exponential leap for us.'
Barnett believes the multimedia manufacturers have not yet spotted the true
potential of multimedia software in a tutorial, rather than purely
one-to-one, instruction.
BUZZWORDS
MULTIMEDIA describes a mixture of resources controlled by computer.
Paper-based sources, computer graphics, video, sound and other choices are
controlled through screen-based options.
RE-PURPOSING means the source material, usually video (which is costly to
film and produce), is adapted for a different purpose by using it with a new
software harness.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Follow your nose to
the new world - A change in wine drinking habits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's wine market seems to have been affected by a touch of
Euro-scepticism. Demand for French, German and Italian wines is falling and
consumers are developing a marked taste for the 'new world' wines of
Australia and New Zealand, South Africa and California.
The EC's big three wine producers still supply the bulk of the UK's light
wines; but their combined volume share of the market has declined from 86
per cent in 1989 to 76 per cent in 1991.
While UK wine imports fell 2.2 per cent overall last year, volumes from
France were 7.4 per cent down, supplies from Italy dropped nearly 6 per
cent, and 4.4 per cent fewer bottles came from Germany. In contrast, there
has been a surge in imports of new world wines as consumers discovered such
names to savour as Jacob's Creek and Hawkes Bay, Pearl Springs and
Inglenook.
New Zealand's wine makers established an office in London last year with a
12-month sales target of 1.8m litres. They sold double that volume. In July
and August this year, shipments increased 76 per cent in volume and 117 per
cent in value over the same months last year.
Australian exports to the UK have grown from 800,000 litres in 1985 to 18.2m
litres in 1991. Volumes for July and August this year were 88 per cent ahead
of the same period last year. US wineries sent 10.5m litres to Britain in
the first half of this year - an increase of 25.5 per cent on the first half
of 1991.
Since the lifting of economic sanctions, South Africa has rapidly
re-established a foothold in the market. Exports rose 61 per cent from 1.7m
litres in 1990 to 2.8m litres in 1991. The tide is running even stronger
this year. Total volumes for the first six months were 156 per cent higher,
and shipments of white wine increased 256 per cent.
These shifts in the pattern of Britain's Pounds 900m-a-year wine trade
reflect a number of influences, not least some shrewd marketing by the new
world producers.
The British are still modest wine consumers - pouring themselves on average
no more than a couple of glasses a week. Though recession at present
encourages restraint, the market's potential for growth is considerable.
Yet many French wines have become over-priced and German wines have suffered
from meagrely-funded promotion. The new world wine producers have seized the
opportunity to appeal to off-licence and supermarket shoppers with
value-for-money products.
Australia and South Africa have focused from the outset on the mid-price
range. California, which first entered the market at the cheaper end and
suffered as a result from a poor quality image, has now climbed into the
same bracket.
Just as much care has been taken over the appeal to consumers' palates as
their pockets. The Victoria Wine chain has trebled sales of Californian wine
and increased sales of New Zealand wine by more than 500 per cent this year.
South African producers, who used the years in which they were barred from
many world markets to improve their viticulture and wine-making techniques,
also put a lot of research into discovering what consumers wanted.
What many UK consumers did not want, it emerged, was the acidity of a
Muscadet or the leathery taste of a Burgundy.
The new world wines have been promoted in the UK with a single-minded
dedication to put as many glasses in the hands of as many people as
possible.
Such marketing has been reinforced by the success of the new world producers
in dispelling much of the mystique in which the European wine industry seems
to be wrapped.
Just decoding a German wine label, cluttered with Gothic script, or
identifying yet another French chateau inhibits many potential consumers.
One factor which has probably contributed much to the increasingly catholic
tastes of the UK consumer has been the labelling of wines with the variety
of grape, such as Chardonnay or Cabernet Sauvignon, from which they were
made, says the Wine and Spirit Association.
There are enough similarities between a Cabernet Sauvignon from California
and one from Australia to reassure the drinker that if he has enjoyed one,
he will enjoy the other.

FT  22 OCT 92 / People: Sir Anthony Tennant to join Morgan Stanley as an
adviser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Anthony Tennant (left), who is stepping down as chairman of Guinness at
the end of the year, is to become a senior adviser and director of Morgan
Stanley International.
Sir Anthony, who says he has worked with Bob Greenhill, president of Morgan
Stanley Group, for many years, had used Morgan Stanley's services when he
was at Grand Met, and then at Guinness where the US investment bank advised,
among other things, on the Glenmore Distilleries acquisition.
Whereas appointments of prestigious names from British business to be
advisers at City institutions do not always in practice amount to much, Sir
Anthony suggests he intends to roll up his sleeves and get closely involved
in Morgan Stanley's work. He says he plans to 'spend a lot of time - as much
as is needed' at the bank, immersing himself not just in group strategic
issues but in the policies and strategies of important clients - including
meeting those clients directly.
Last month confirmed as chairman of Christie's when Lord Carrington steps
down next May, and recently appointed to the board of Forte, Sir Anthony
suggests his time post-Guinness is now more or less spoken for. 'My main
activities will be Christie's, Morgan Stanley and Forte in that sort of
order,' he explained yesterday. 'I think that will be enough, don't you?'
*****
David Beynon, formerly a main board director at Allied Dunbar, has been
named managing director of Midland Personal Financial Services and chief
executive of Midland Life, its life assurance subsidiary. He is the third
main board member to leave Allied Dunbar since the departure of Mike Wilson
in late 1990 to join Sir Mark Weinberg in the new J Rothschild Assurance
Company.
Beynon, who started out as an Allied Dunbar salesman 17 years ago, says
there is no suggestion that the hard selling reputation garnered over the
years by Allied Dunbar will be transplanted to Midland Bank. 'They have this
horrible reputation as Allied Crowbar', Beynon says. 'In fact, they are only
aggressive on prospecting for names. Once they make a sales call, they are
very professional and don't hard sell at all. And there is no need for
prospecting at Midland.'
Banks in general, and Midland in particular, have the three necessary
ingredients to survive in the increasingly competitive retail financial
services business: a directly-employed sales force, multi-channel
distribution and 'a source of warm clients', Beynon says. Midland has plans
to increase its personal financial services sales staff to 750 by the end of
1993 from 450 now.

Professor Douglas McWilliams is stepping down from his post as chief
economic adviser to the Confederation of British Industry. He has been a
ubiquitous presence on radio and television in recent months and has
consistently taken a gloomy line on the prospects for the UK economy.
'Unfortunately, I have been proved to be right,' he says.
McWilliams will still act as a consultant to the CBI but will no longer be
an official spokesman for the organisation. Meanwhile he has big plans for
his consultancy London Economics which is to be renamed the Centre for
Economics and Business Research. One service he hopes to provide is a user's
guide to the effectiveness of the many business surveys which are produced.
He also hopes to return to the cricket field where a leg injury, which he
once suspected to be gout, restricted his play this year. These days he is
built for comfort rather than speed, but his canny swing bowling has tricked
many a good batsman. Even more important for a cricketer, he knows that the
most important battle to win is the post-match discussion in the bar.

FT  22 OCT 92 / People: More turnover in small business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank has appointed new directors of its small business services
division more frequently in recent years than most of its customers change
their PIN numbers.
The newest appointee to the small firms' job is Mike Shaw, at present
Lloyds' area director in charge of 17 branches in Birmingham.
Aged 45, Shaw will shortly be moving to Bristol to lead a team of a dozen
head office staff and some 800-900 staff in the bank's 355 business centres.
Shaw will become head of business services within UK retail banking and is a
couple of rungs further up the banking ladder than his predecessor who was
in the job for about a year. Shaw's greater seniority reflects the increased
importance Lloyds attaches to the small business sector, the bank says.
Shaw believes one of the main problems the banks face in dealing with
customers is poor communications rather than any basic flaw in the service
provided. The publication today of a 'contract' with small business
customers to replace the rather anaemic customers' charter produced by the
bank a year ago may do something to improve that relationship.
Shaw joined the bank in 1968 and after a spell in London had postings with
four different branches of the Bank of London and South America (BOLSA) in
Brazil followed by 12 years in North America.
He has most recently been occupied in defending from demolition the Rotunda
building in Birmingham's unloved Bull Ring which houses one of Lloyds'
busiest branches. He led the bank's fight against a compulsory purchase
order earlier this year though the government has yet to give a final
ruling.
Appropriately enough for a banker, Shaw is a keen numismatist - he has an
almost complete collection of British crowns - though he took up the hobby
before joining Lloyds.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: A gloomy global forecast for the
profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE wanting to get a flavour of the global state of the accountancy
profession could have done no better than to attend the 14th World Congress
of Accountants in Washington DC last week. Sitting in the huge Convention
Centre auditorium, in the middle of the capital of the country with more
accountants than any other, was like being inside a barometer measuring the
prospects for the industry around the world. The forecast was not good.
The most significant indicator was the lack of activity. As Mr Dennis
Beresford, the chairman of the US Financial Accounting Standards Board, put
it later: 'Many of the delegates were disguised as empty chairs.'
Officials tidying up at the end of the four-day gathering estimated that
2,850 people attended the congress. Stripping away the 'accompanying
persons', journalists, staff and accountants from the surrounding region who
were hauled in on three-line whips by the organisers, the number of serious
delegates going to many sessions was considerably lower.
The total might still seem an impressive number, but it was substantially
down on the previous congress five years ago, and has left the organisers -
headed by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) - with a loss
probably running into several hundreds of thousands of dollars. The
attendance says a lot about the depressing state of business in the
accountancy firms, most notably those in North America, the UK and much of
the rest of Europe. After a decade of heady growth, many are now expanding
at rates below the level of inflation, some are reporting absolute declines
and others have been forced to merge or close.
At the same time some of the more enthusiastic delegates at the congress
served as a reminder that business - and hence accountancy - in some parts
of the world, such as south-east Asia, is very different and even
flourishing. The IFAC is able to point to 110 member bodies from nearly 80
countries, representing 1.2m accountants.
In general, one of the most lively sessions was on the state of the
profession in the developing countries. Elsewhere, groups from eastern
Europe were listening attentively as they attempted to kindle future
development and expansion of their infant accountancy networks. But the
messages from the Anglo-Saxon world were far from bullish.
Aside from the sluggish state of the world economy, a number of the
specialist sessions during the congress were instructively gloomy. While
those on technical subjects were among the most heavily attended, two on
more wide-ranging subjects stood out.
The first was on the expansion of environmental reporting by companies,
including many multi-nationals. That could bode well, offering accountants
the chance to become involved in a new area of auditing and consultancy
work. But the speakers also stressed the risks, since auditors could
potentially be held liable in the future for unidentified and undisclosed
liabilities such as toxic waste clean-up obligations imposed on their
clients.
Even more significant was a session on legal liability. There was lengthy
discussion about the collapse of Tricontinental in Australia, which
generated, at Dollars 1.1bn, the largest known claim at the time against an
auditor. That level has since been overshadowed earlier this month by the
Pounds 8bn claim concerning the Bank of Credit and Commerce International.
Speakers renewed their claims for tort reform to reduce the incidence and
size of claims against auditing firms - which they argue are not responsible
for the collapse of companies. One glimmer of optimism came from a bill now
proposed in the state of New South Wales in Australia which could become law
early next year. That would cap the size of claims that auditors and other
professionals would be required to pay. It would also require all firms to
take out indemnity insurance or have assets sufficient to cover claims up to
the specified limits.
More generally, Mr Richard Murray, chairman of the global professional
services division of Minet, the insurer, warned that commercial cover might
no longer continue to be available to firms facing claims at the current
escalating rates. There may be a need for governments to step in and provide
cover for uninsurable business, he warned.
Mr Murray said that while accountants should continue to press externally
for reform of litigation, they should also look internally at how they
manage risk. That could mean turning away clients perceived to be
fraudulent, in danger of collapse or likely in some other way to give rise
to legal action which might trigger a legal claim. The issue raises
questions over how such companies would continue to find alternative audit
firms in the future.
While the World Congress did give delegates a depressing glimpse of some of
the issues now facing the profession, a number of those attending questioned
privately whether the idea of such an ambitious and wide-ranging gathering
was becoming a rather anachronistic way of exchanging ideas.
Mr Bertil Edlund, IFAC president, puts a brave face on such criticism and on
the lower levels of attendance this year. He points out that the congress
was able to go ahead, while those of many other industries and professions
have been so harshly affected by the recession that they have been unable to
take place at all. Mr Edlund also stresses the subtle achievements of
fostering greater international collaboration and consensus, particularly
through informal discussions and meetings which took place outside the
public sessions.
There is certainly some substance to his argument. Away from the convention
centre, for example, Mr Anatoly Sheremet, president of the Association of
Accountants and Auditors of the Commonwealth of Independent States, was busy
talking to officials at the World Bank. He is attempting to gather support
for foreign loans totalling up to Dollars 500m to help with the development
of the profession in the former Soviet Union.
An equally important session took place just after the congress at the
headquarters of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards in Norwalk,
Connecticut. World standard-setters met to exchange progress reports and
discuss how they could work more closely together in the future. As the
speakers around the table discussed their agendas, two issues stood out: how
little co-operation currently exists and how much common ground there was on
issues being tackled.
Several different countries mentioned draft accounting standards on topics
such as financial instruments, related-party transactions, leases and
intangible assets. Yet one clear difference remains: the purpose for which
accounts are prepared. For the the US and the UK, for instance, it is
clearly stock market investors. For Germany, by contrast, it is creditors,
especially the banks.
Inevitably the accounting standards that result are different and the
pressures and speed of reform vary considerably. Several speakers argued
that with growing demand from companies for access to international capital
markets, there will inevitably be growing requirements for the harmonisation
of standards of financial reporting with which they will have to comply.
Yet it seems that at the moment the importance of international
collaboration is still principally being driven from the outside and from
the top downwards, by a relatively small number of accountants. Their
concerns are seemingly still not considered important by either the vast
majority of partners in the delegates' own firms nor by the wider business
community.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Aspinall loses in casino battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Aspinall, the casino and zoo operator, was ordered to pay Pounds
160,000 costs yesterday after failing to block a casino licence application
by London Clubs International.
A licensing committee at Thames Magistrates Court granted a gaming licence
for London Clubs' Golden Nugget casino, in Soho, in spite of Mr Aspinall's
objection.
Licences for four other casinos, including the Ritz and Les Ambassadeurs,
are likely to be granted on Friday.
The future of London Clubs' six casinos, which account for about 40 per cent
of London's gaming business, has been in doubt since four casinos were
raided by police and Gaming Board officials in June 1991.
This forced the abandonment of the company's stock market flotation,
scheduled for a few days later.
The Gaming Board applied for the cancellation of all six clubs' licences,
alleging serious breaches of gaming laws.
However, after the resignation this year of the chairman, several directors
and senior managers of London Clubs, and the restructuring of the company
and its shareholders, the Gaming Board issued certificates of consent for
six new gaming licences.
Mr John Mathew QC, representing Mr Aspinall's company, Aspinall Clubs, said
the company's past history was relevant to the granting of licences to the
new management. Mr George Carman QC, representing London Clubs, said Mr
Aspinall's objection had been 'irresponsible in the extreme', as no evidence
of the current management's unfitness had been produced.
He said the public might feel that Mr Aspinall's objections were motivated
by his own involvement in the casino business. Mr Aspinall has not yet
decided whether to object to a sixth casino's licence application, which is
due to be heard by a different licensing committee this month.

FT  22 OCT 92 / OFT review clears detergent makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAUNDRY detergents market has escaped a reference to theMonopolies and
Mergers Commission, the Office of Fair Trading said yesterday.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he had seriously
considered the case for a monopoly reference. He had decided against it
after a review by the OFT found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour by
Procter &amp; Gamble of the US and Lever Brothers of the UK, which dominate the
business.
Sir Bryan said he would continue to watch out for evidence of P&amp;G and Lever
Brothers abusing their market power. The two companies account for about 90
per cent of laundry detergent sales, worth more than Pounds 800m a year.
Sir Bryan said detailed financial information provided by the companies did
not show that price competition was ineffective and he was encouraged by
recent improvements in productivity.
The OFT has monitored the detergents market since 1981 when P&amp;G and Lever
Brothers, part of the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group, were released from
undertakings imposed after an MMC investigation in 1966. The OFT launched a
more detailed review almost two years ago, prompted by a sharp rise in the
two companies' advertising expenditure.
Sir Bryan said he had been concerned that high levels of advertising
spending might prevent new competitors from entering the market, but noted
its relation to product innovation. He said: 'At the present time,
competition between Procter &amp; Gamble and Lever Brothers appears to be
active, and there is also competition from retailer own-label brands.'
The companies welcomed the announcement, having argued that competition
between them had intensified recently because of heavy investment in
research and production equipment to expand and modernise product ranges.
The OFT accepted undertakings from Anthony Green &amp; Co and Lavery Rowe, its
advertising agency, that they would stop publishing misleading
advertisements for depilatory products. The action followed a complaint by
the Advertising Standards Authority, which had sought to get the companies
to drop claims that the products retarded the re-growth of hair.

FT  22 OCT 92 / IoM pays Pounds 4.5m over failed bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANX government is to make ex-gratia payments totalling Pounds 4.5m to
depositors with the Savings and Investment Bank, which crashed in the Isle
of Man in 1982.
The island's parliament voted overwhelmingly yesterday in favour of making
the payments in an effort to put the whole saga to rest.
The bank failed with debts of Pounds 42m and about 3,000 creditors. Many had
deposits of Pounds 20,000 or less in the bank and some lost their life
savings.
The ex-gratia payment scheme was proposed by Mr Miles Walker, the island's
chief minister, and is designed particularly to help smaller depositors. The
payment will be 50 per cent of the amount on deposit, subject to a maximum
payment of Pounds 5,000.
Mr Walker told the parliament that the scheme was based on a compensation
scheme available in mainland UK in 1982. That scheme allowed 75 per cent
compensation but retained the right to take assignments that depositors
received from other sources. Because the Manx scheme will not take
depositors' other assignments, the amount has been set at 50 per cent. The
bank's creditors have only received 27p in the Pounds 1 from the liquidation
and are unlikely to recover more.
Mr Walker reminded members of parliament that the two main reports into the
bank's failure had condemned the banking supervision of the Manx government
of the day.
However, the depositors' case alleging negligence against Manx government
officers and politicians was lost when it went before the UK Privy Council
in April 1990.
Mr Walker said: 'We have no legal responsibility to make any payment to any
depositor.' The Manx government views the scheme as a gesture of goodwill.
For many depositors, however, those payments are too little, too late. Mr
Ken Potts, a depositor on the committee of inspection, said he and a group
of other depositors intended to return to the courts after they had received
the ex-gratia payment. The Chadwick report into the bank's failure,
published last month, has furnished them with previously withheld
information that they feel will give them a sound case against the Manx
government or its officers for full compensation.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERKINS of the UK and Volvo Penta of Sweden, two leading manufacturers of
marine diesels, are to collaborate in developing, manufacturing and
marketing a new range of small diesels for boats.
The 10-year agreement exceeds Dollars 200m (Pounds 116m) in value, and
builds on existing collaboration over the past five years between the two
companies on light marine diesels for use as sailboat auxiliary units and
motor boats.
Under the latest deal, Volvo Penta will exclusively market a range of
jointly developed, Perkins-built marine engines of up to 0.6 litre per
cylinder and less than 150 bhp.
Mr Tony Gilroy, Perkins managing director, said: 'By combining our joint
strengths we believe that we will substantially increase our position in the
world market for diesel engines.' The deal is the second piece of good news
this week for Peterborough-based Perkins. On Monday it announced a big order
from Chrysler for high-technology 'green' engines to power a new range of
Mexican-built Dodge trucks.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Bomb police reject criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD JOHNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND YARD last night angrily refuted charges that it had been slow to
react to IRA bomb warnings as a fresh spate of bombings hit London. It said
the warnings were aimed at creating confusion and discrediting the police.
The first blast was at 4.36pm on a bridge near Silver Street station,
Edmonton, north London. Three people were slightly injured. British
transport police had said just before the explosion that no security alerts
were under way.
At a press conference Mr George Churchill-Coleman, commander of the
anti-terrorist squad, said: 'It takes time to react and we couldn't have
reacted any faster than we did.'
The conference was delayed by a second explosion at the Territorial Army
centre in Olympia at 8.36pm which slightly injured three people. A third
device went off at 9.14pm on a railway in Willesden.
All routes out of Euston station were closed as police searched for further
devices. British Rail said it was unable to say whether today's rail
services would be affected.
Mr Churchill-Coleman said police were still 'investigating' the IRA
statement issued in Dublin to a media organisation just after 3.30pm, an
hour before the first blast. The statement - also passed on by the Irish
Garda - said: 'In spite of repeated phone calls to a number of London radio
stations, British police have made no effort to act on authenticated
warnings that our volunteers have a bomb on the rail line at Four Bridges on
the North Circular Road, London.'
Mr Churchill-Coleman described the IRA claim as part of a campaign to make
the police look 'confused, incompetent and inept'. Before yesterday's
incidents the IRA's 'so-called codeword' had been used 61 times since
February last year and 37 of these had been hoaxes.
Nine radio stations covering north London said they had not received a
tip-off.
An IRA car bomb went off last night in the centre of Bangor, County Down.
There were no reports of serious injuries.

The bases affected are at Leuchars, Fyfe, Brawdy in Dyfed, Manston in Kent

FT  22 OCT 92 / Life insurers shed 22,000 agents in shake-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIFE insurance industry has lost 22,000 sales agents since the end of
June last year - a drop of roughly 12 per cent in 16 months - because of
tougher monitoring by regulators and the effects of the recession, according
to Lautro, the self-regulatory body for the industry.
Most of those were 'tied' sales agents who sell the products of one
insurance company exclusively but are not employed directly by it. Tied
agents have been identified most closely with sharp practice and have been
targeted for special oversight.
Lautro also said that in the year to June 30 it had experienced a 50 per
cent rise in consumer complaints to 1,999. Although the rise was dramatic,
it was less than the 69 per cent rise reported over the previous year.
Ms Julia Leisching, chief policy and administration officer at Lautro, said:
'People are looking at how much its costs to control these tied agents and
saying 'it's not worth it'.' She said that a further shake-out of sales
agents was likely as Lautro's new rules on training and competence took
effect.
The figures are contained in Lautro's annual report for the 12 months ended
June 30.
Over the year, Lautro conducted 73 period inspection visits - routine visits
to review members' compliance. Of those, 19 found compliance difficulties so
serious that a special investigation was launched. All of those involved the
activities of tied agents, Ms Leisching said.
The regulatory organisation said that just under half of the nearly 2,000
consumer complaints were still under consideration, while just under half of
those processed were resolved in favour of the complainant.
One area where Lautro's monitoring efforts have produced significant
improvements lies in uncovering breaches of advertising rules.
The stepped-up regulatory efforts have produced a 25 per cent rise in
Lautro's enforcement costs over the year, contributing to an operating loss
of Pounds 312,000.
The salary of Mr Barry Sherlock, the part-time chairman of Lautro, has more
than doubled from the previous year to Pounds 42,830.
Barder &amp; Marsh, the Lloyd's agency, has reached agreement in principle with
Wendover Underwriting Agency, to take over the management of five syndicates
administered by Wendover, Richard Lapper writes.
The announcement is further evidence of the rationalisation among syndicates
and agencies at the insurance market, hard hit by recent losses.
At least 50 of the 279 syndicates trading in London are not expected to
survive into next year.
The combined Barder &amp; Marsh and Wendover business will have a capacity (or
capital base) of about Pounds 200m next year.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Smaller charities feeling the pinch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S CHARITY sector is shrinking, with public and corporate donations
down in real terms, the Charities Aid Foundation said yesterday.
The foundation's annual Charity Trends - one of the main sources of
information about the voluntary sector - shows a growing divergence between
the fortunes of a small group of large charities and the rest. Britain's 400
biggest charities increased their real income from voluntary donations by
about 6 per cent last year.
Mr Michael Brophy, the foundation's executive director, said it resulted
from their greater professionalism and disguised the 'acute difficulties
many medium-sized and smaller charities are having in keeping going'.
The report shows that the real income of the sector as a whole fell by 13.8
per cent between 1985 and 1990, after a period of regular growth during the
previous 10 years.
A study of 86 companies indicated that their giving fell in real terms by
3.8 per cent in 1990-91 and a further 1.5 per cent in 1991-92. Average

FT  22 OCT 92 / Birmingham accused of inner-city bias
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM'S concentration on the regeneration of its city centre with a few
large-scale development projects has failed to secure a fair distribution of
benefits throughout the city and has helped to make social inequality worse,
according to a study published today.
The study, from the University of Central England in Birmingham (formerly
Birmingham Polytechnic), questions the merit of large-scale spending on
projects such as the International Convention Centre (ICC), venue of the
recent EC summit, and the National Indoor Arena.
It includes the premise that 'urban regeneration is not achievable without
social regeneration'.
The examination of Birmingham's performance in seeking to strengthen the
local economy by trickling down wealth from an enlarged services sector in
the city centre to deprived suburbs offers lessons for other UK cities.
In differing degrees, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool, Sheffield and Bradford
have all followed similar policies, based on the experience of US cities
such as Baltimore, Boston and Detroit in the 1970s.
The authors of the study provide evidence to show that the scale of
Birmingham City Council funding of what they call 'prestige developments'
has diverted resources from education and housing.
They also note that special training schemes aimed at ensuring that
inner-city residents gained access to the 275 full-time jobs at the ICC
resulted in the provision of only 19 jobs, of which 14 were in low-pay
occupations such as cleaning and security.
The ICC has been a focal point of the city council's aspirations to present
Birmingham as an international city.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Lloyds shifts on companies: Small-business customers to
receive new statement from bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Bank will announce a revised 'contract' with its 350,000
small-business customers today to replace the statement of improved services
it published a year ago.
The bank was criticised by small-business groups for the vagueness of the
document it produced last November, when all the other large banks were
publishing codes of conduct. Lloyds refused to call its initial statement of
principles either a charter or a code.
Next month it will send a contract to each of its small-business customers.
The contract commits the bank to dealing fairly and openly with customers
and promises to provide advance warning of any changes in tariffs and terms
of borrowing.
The Forum of Private Business, a small companies' lobby group, said the
contract represented 'a giant stride towards greater transparency in the
small-business banking relationship'. It awarded the contract 90 points out
of 100, higher than any other bank has attained, which compares with the 33
per cent rating for Lloyds' earlier charter.
The contract states that from the end of next year Lloyds will notify
customers in advance about service charges. It says: 'This means you will be
given a detailed breakdown of any charges before they are deducted from your
account so that you can check them and query anything you do not
understand.' The contract explains the bank's complaints procedure from
branch level up to the banking ombudsman.
Lloyds said it had decided to revise its original statement to 'express our
commitment to our business customers in a more meaningful way'.
Mr Gerry Solomon, senior general manager of UK retail banking, said: 'We
have listened very carefully to comments from customers and small-business
groups in drawing up the new document.'
As well as setting out the bank's commitment to customers, the charter
explains the factors the bank takes into account when calculating interest
rates, and points out the need for customers to provide it with accurate and
up-to-date information on the health of their business.
The banks were urged to produce codes of conduct by Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, after criticism of their failure to cut loan rates in line with
base-rate cuts last year.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Barclays to talk on staff loan cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank is to talk to unions about cuts in cheap loans for staff.
The specialised staff loans are for cars, school fees and holiday and
retirement homes. The move is consistent with attempts by all the banks to
reduce costs in the recession.
Barclays Group Staff Union, which represents more than half the 77,000
staff, said the bank's agreement to talks at a regular meeting was
surprising. Barclays has always argued that the benefits are not negotiable.
The cuts, which will affect only new loan applications, took effect from the
beginning of this month.
BGSU said it had not been consulted on the cuts and warned the bank to
expect a 'fierce outcry'. The union said members were still smarting from a
pay award of a little more than 3 per cent on average and substantial job
losses.
Bifu, the banking union, which also represents Barclays staff, condemned the
cuts as 'petty and penny-pinching'. It said many staff thought the
announcement was a joke.
Barclays said the four loans had been replaced with two packages, similar to
those available to customers, but at a discount to staff. The bank said that
would offer staff greater flexibility and reduce the costly administrative
burden.
Barclays said it was happy to talk, but as the benefits were not
contractual, they were not negotiable. Unions were free to make
representations on any subject, but management did not plan to change its
position.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Labour rounds on abstainers: Six rebel Tories oppose
government but motion to keep pits open is lost by 13 votes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGRY Labour backbenchers rounded on eight Ulster Unionist MPs whose
abstentions ensured the government a comfortable majority of 13 at the end
of the fiercely argued debate on the government's pit closure programme in
the Commons last night.
A Labour motion demanding that no pit should be closed until the completion
of a report by the trade and industry select committee was defeated by 320
votes to 307.
Six rebel Tories voted for the motion and five others abstained, but
Labour's hopes of defeating the government disappeared when Mr David Hunt,
the Welsh secretary, sealed a deal reached with the Ulster Unionists in the
closing speech for the government.
Mr Roy Beggs, Ulster Unionist MP for Antrim East, asked if an extended
review of energy policy promised by the government would take account of the
needs of Northern Ireland.
Mr Hunt answered: 'Without any qualification I can give that assurance'.
In a second vote a government amendment which would permit some of the pits
to close where agreement is reached with the workforce was carried by a
majority of 15 (320-305).
The Tory MPs who voted against the government were Mr Richard Alexander
(Newark), Mr Michael Clark (Rochford), Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and
Spen), Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge Brownhills), Mrs Ann Winterton
(Congleton) and Mr Nicholas Winterton (Macclesfield).
The abstainers were Sir Richard Body (Holland with Boston), Mr Peter Fry
(Wellingborough), Mr David Nicholson (Taunton), Mr Toby Jessel (Twickenham),
and Sir Patrick McNair-Wilson (New Forest).
Earlier Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, reassured
some of the Tory backbenchers who had earlier threatened to vote against the
government.
He promised that the extended review would ensure that British Coal was not
being deprived of its fair share of the energy market through preferential
treatment accorded to nuclear power and the privatised electricity
companies.
Mr Martin O'Neill, Labour's energy spokesman, complained that Mr Heseltine
had inadvertently misled the House by implying that even the 10 worst
loss-making pits already earmarked for closure might remain in production.
Mr Winston Churchill (C Davyhulme), who emerged last week as a leading
rebel, ran a gauntlet of Labour derision when he confirmed that he would,
after all, vote for the government.
Reacting angrily to taunts from the benches of 'hypocrite', he claimed that
Labour had closed pits 'twice as fast as any Conservative government' when
it was in office.
The cost of throwing 30,000 miners on the dole would 'far exceed' the Pounds
1bn cost of subsidising each tonne produced by British Coal to the level of
world prices, he said.
It was not just the miners who had been granted a 90-day stay of execution -
so had Mr Heseltine.
Mr Patrick Cormack (C Staffordshire South), emphasised the significance of
the expanded review by telling Mr Heseltine 'it is for that reason and that
reason alone' that many Tory backbenchers would vote in the government lobby
at the end of the debate. In an ominous rider, he noted that if the review
proved to be of a different character, the Tory critics would have an
opportunity to vote against the government on a subsequent occasion.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry spokesman, demanded
that the government implement a moratorium on new gas-fired power stations
until the coal review was completed.
The genuineness of the extended review was strongly challenged by Mr Robin
Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary. To a roar of approval from the
Labour benches, he called for the closure threat to be removed from all 31
pits, and a frank admission from Mr Heseltine that in making his original
proposal he had got it wrong.
Mr Cook declared: 'We will mobilise the deep public anger you have aroused
until you do admit you were wrong, and until you do admit that the British
economy needs the British coal industry.'
Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, accused ministers of having 'lied,
lied and lied about the mining industry'.
He forecast that the vote at the end of the debate would not determine the
issue.
Mr Benn said: 'The British public has been reawakened not just about the
mining industry but about the whole rotten philosophy of the 1980s.'

FT  22 OCT 92 / CBI calls for energy policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Industrial Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry called for a statement of energy
policy from the government yesterday, and Sir Michael Angus, CBI president,
called last week's pit closure announcement 'a monumental cock-up'.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, said: 'The government did not seem
to have a framework within which to justify its decision. There is a need
for a clearer statement on energy policy.'
The CBI said it had not formed a view on the attractions of coal versus
other types of fuel for electricity generation.
Sir Michael said: 'We want the commercial economics spelt out, so that they
can receive proper public examination.'
He commented that industry's confidence in the government's ability to
manage had been severely bruised by the presentation of the coal closures.
He said: 'The timing of the announcement and of the actions that were to
follow it were very maladroit.'
He said the CBI council, which met yesterday, had expressed very serious
concern about the depth of the recession and the possible knock-on effects
of the closures.
A report by leading academics on UK energy policy, published yesterday,
attacked the government for 'lack of direction' in the energy sector and
called for an energy commission to formulate policy.
The study was sponsored by Scottish Nuclear and led by Professor Ian Fells,
professor of energy conversion at Newcastle University, and Professor Nigel
Lucas, professor of energy policy at Imperial College, London, who gathered
the views of many senior academics. It condemned what it called
'unco-ordinated policy-making by regulators'.
The report said: 'Bodies such as Offer and Ofgas (the electricity and gas
industry regulators) should regulate markets' roles and not determine energy
policy.
'There is a need to ensure harmony rather than conflict between market
economic and environmental regulation. This should be a function of
government, which at present it seems reluctant to assume.'
The authors condemned pit closures and warned that, in addition to importing
coal, the UK would have to import gas if many combined-cycle gas turbines
were built.
It warned of the danger of relying on gas imports from often distant and
politically unstable countries.

Michael Heseltine Friday October 16
'I do not anticipate any changes in the timetable'

John Major Sunday October 18
'An announcement of this sort is bound to produce that sort of reaction but

Michael Heseltine 'Well, I mean, that is going to cost dramatic sums of
money and that will come off, what - hospitals, schools, roads?'
Michael Heseltine, asked if there could be a moratorium 'I do not think
there is a case that I can see for changing the recommendations that I have

specify the nature of the help that we can give'
Michael Heseltine Monday October 19

purpose of this morning's cabinet meeting is to consider the conclusions we

Michael Heseltine to MPs 'During this moratorium, the government and British
Coal will set out the full case for the closures'

FT  22 OCT 92 / MP sees hand of Treasury at work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID HOWELL, a former Conservative energy secretary, told the Commons
yesterday that he detected the hand of the Treasury in last week's pit
closure announcement, David Owen writes. 'I suspect that if we follow back
the powder trail from where the explosion took place last week, it will lead
to the Treasury,' he said in the coal debate.
Describing the proposed closures as the first of a series of unpopular
decisions to arise from this year's tough public spending round, he
questioned government reforms in the way the round is conducted.
In particular, he urged the government to treat 'the idea of a rigid control
total' with 'very great care as a concept', noting: 'We tried it in 1982-83
and it didn't work.'
In times of deflation, he said, public spending should be 'determined by
what can be prudently financed'. He added: 'Until we depoliticise the
announcement of our short-term interest rates, we will continue to have
difficulties.'

FT  22 OCT 92 / Contractors wary of rule change on funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister's promise to relax Treasury rules inhibiting private
investment in roads and railways may give contractors and bankers a feeling
of deja vu.
In 1989, Mr Major, then chancellor, used very similar language when
scrapping the so-called 'Ryrie Rules' used by the Treasury to determine
whether private finance was suitable for infrastructure investment. The
ending of the Ryrie guidelines was supposed to encourage investment in a new
generation of privately financed projects.
Three years later, Britain has yet to build a metre of privately financed
motorway. Plans to build a privately funded high-speed rail link to the
Channel tunnel are in disarray due to political indecision over proposed
routes.
The main complaint of potential investors is that Treasury guidelines that
replaced the Ryrie Rules remain too restrictive.
Ryrie stipulated private schemes should not proceed unless they could be
financed more efficiently than by the public sector.
The new guidelines are contained in a document entitled: Economic Appraisal
in Central Government; a Technical Guide for Government Departments - better
known as the 'Green Book' - published in April 1991.
That stresses that privately financed projects must provide better value
than the public sector. Officials, however, can make allowance for
construction and revenue risks that otherwise would have to be undertaken by
the taxpayer.
That should have allowed more leeway for financially hard-pressed government
departments seeking to maintain building programmes by tapping private
investors.
In practice, only one concession for a private motorway has been approved.
The Birmingham Northern Relief Road, proposed in 1989 as the country's first
privately funded motorway, has still to face a public inquiry next summer.
Trafalgar House, the UK construction, property, shipping and hotels group,
and Iritecna, Italy's biggest toll road operator, however, expect to have
spent Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m by the time construction starts in 1994.
Contractors are wary of paying millions of pounds to prepare innovative
schemes only to find that they are put out to tender, with no guarantee of
them winning the work.
The biggest obstacle, says Mr Patrick de Pelet of merchant bank Kleinwort
Benson, has been industry's failure to persuade Treasury officials that
public-sector grants might be used alongside private investment in marginal
schemes.
Another solution proposed by companies such as Trafalgar House and John
Laing, which is building a privately financed bridge across the River
Severn, would be to allow private investors to acquire public roads.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Industry hopes for political dialogue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH industry is hoping that the government's new economic strategy also
embraces a fresh determination to consult a business community left
increasingly frustrated at its inability to influence economic events.
For the time being, industry leaders are likely to remain sceptical about
promises made in the heat of political crisis. They will withhold for a
while their verdict on whether a new era of understanding and mutual
co-operation really is under way.
Last week, the prime minister pledged that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
would begin an intensive round of discussions with business leaders on how a
cheaper pound can be fully exploited.
Yesterday Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, endorsed the need for a
continuing, high-level dialogue between government and every sector of
industry.
Mr Sainsbury emphasised that the DTI, which has spent the past six months
trying to reorganise itself into a more sympathetic, responsive department,
has 'no pot of gold and no magic wand'. Industry says it is not in the
market for handouts; the chance to put across its case and maybe influence
policy will be good enough.
Signs exist that efforts by ministers to consult industry more closely were
already being made before the latest ministerial commitments to an improved
dialogue.
Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry, was
surprised to be called in last week by Mr Lamont at short notice to give a
rundown on the CBI's recipe for economic recovery.
He asked for a more coherent statement on policies for economic growth, and
further interest rate cuts, a tight public-sector spending round and
protection for capital projects and training.
The CBI president said yesterday: 'One would rather assume that at this
particular moment, with one or two things falling around them, they would
listen more intently.'
The Institute of Directors also had a chance to put views directly to the
chancellor last week. Mr Peter Morgan, IoD director-general, has had a
session with Mr Heseltine in the past few days and meetings with senior
civil servants have recently been stepped up.
The IoD says that, this week, the government has disclosed an economic
strategy that reflects many of the initiatives it has been pressing on
ministers in recent weeks. An official added: 'There has been a distinct
change. Ministers are ringing up and asking us in for a chat.'
The Engineering Employers' Federation, which last week said it was drawing
up its own strategy for economic revival, to be published next month, said
it had not yet detected signs of the improved dialogue it has been calling
for since the general election.
Mr Neil Johnson, EEF director general, welcomed the prime minister's
strategy for growth as recognition of the serious concerns of the business
community.
He added: 'I urge the prime minister to involve industry in the development
of his plans and not to rely on the mandarins alone. He will find us an
enthusiastic and very realistic partner.'
Having made its commitment, the government will now be watched closely by
the business community to see if its promises of a new partnership
materialise.
It has bridges to rebuild with industry, not just with the broader
electorate.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Optimism over Jubilee extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Underground is be-coming increasingly optimistic that the government
may after all give the green light to the Pounds 1.7bn extension of the
Jubilee Line to London's Docklands.
Its confidence stems from the switch in economic strategy towards growth and
employment signalled by Mr John Major, the prime minister, on Tuesday night.
Mr Major said he was determined that cuts needed to meet Treasury targets in
the present spending round should not fall on projects with a direct impact
on jobs and growth.
London Underground was yesterday intepreting that as a signal that the
Jubilee Line extension, which will create up to 12,000 jobs during its
construction and help regenerate Docklands, will be spared.
The Underground's optimism was reflected in its decision to hold an
exhibition of architectural designs for the Jubilee Line extension at The
Economist Building in London's West End.
Opening a preview of the exhibition, Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, London
Underground's managing director, said: 'Amid growing political concern both
in and out of parliament about investment-led growth, this is the only
project that can put people into jobs quickly.
'Within 45 days of the go-ahead, we will have more than Pounds 1bn worth of
contracts ready for signature. By next Easter we could have 5,000 people
directly employed on the line's construction and up to 7,000 more in related
jobs.'
Mr Tunnicliffe confirmed that London Underground was considering moving
2,000 of its staff into a building called FC6 in Cabot Square, Canary Wharf,
if the Jubilee Line was built.
The announcement appears to be aimed at encouraging Canary Wharf's bankers
to meet the government's demand of a no-strings-attached offer of financial
help towards the line's construction.
Mr Tunnicliffe said he could not guarantee that the move would take place if
the line was built. 'We are in negotiations with the administrators and
there is not yet a price that convinces us that it is the best price in
town, but we are pretty confident we are going to get a deal,' he said.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Political Notebook: Jogging for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major has put his economic policy in place. He stated it most
clearly in an interview this week with Mr Michael Brunson of ITN: 'A
strategy for growth is what we need; a strategy for growth is what we are
going to have.'
The vacuum left by sterling's departure from the European exchange rate
mechanism has been filled by an approach that says deflation rather than
inflation poses the most immediate threat to the economy.
It is not quite a dash for growth. Rather a medium-paced jog. Mr Major has
not abandoned the fight against inflation that persuaded him to endure the
pain of the ERM. There are sensible economic arguments to be marshalled in
favour of some further relaxation of monetary policy.
A central part of the new strategy is to talk up shattered business and
consumer confidence. Presentation may in the end be as important as actual
policy adjustments in persuading consumers to spend and businesses to
invest.
Political confidence is also vital. After the coal industry debacle, Mr
Major faced the prospect that the Conservative party would disintegrate
under the pressures of public spending cuts in the Autumn Statement and his
determination to ratify the Maastricht treaty. His judgment was that the
cost of stable prices had become too high for the economy, the electorate
and his own backbench MPs to bear.
So when ministerial colleagues tell him that no great harm will come from
some acceleration in inflation, the prime minister no longer shows them the
door. Instead, he is inclined to quote from the satirical novel Scoop: 'Up
to a point, Lord Copper.'
Not all in the government have caught up with the switch in emphasis. The
prime minister appears to be running ahead of the Treasury, which insisted
yesterday that very little had changed.
But the message from Mr Major's intimates was unambiguous. He had discussed
with Mr Norman Lamont the Treasury's latest (gloomy) domestic economic
forecasts and the deteriorating international environment. Inflation was
under control and the prospects for output at best flat.
So policy would now be directed towards promoting recovery. Mr Lamont would
spell out the strategy in the Autumn Statement. The prime minister was
perfectly happy with headlines declaring 'Major goes for growth'.
The chancellor will be more cautious in his presentation. Even now, Treasury
mandarins are writing into the drafts of next week's Mansion House speech
the usual warnings that he will be as willing to raise interest rates as
reduce them if circumstances demand.
But the frame of mind of those operating the policy levers is more important
than public statements of good intentions. Two weeks ago Mr Major was
cautious about interest rate cuts. Now he is looking for an opportunity for
another reduction soon after the Autumn Statement.
A looser monetary policy will be offset by a determination to hold to the
Treasury's spending targets. Mr Major has said he is determined to protect
capital projects. Public-sector pay will be correspondingly squeezed. That
balance of spending is deemed less inflationary than in past years.
The new emphasis placed by Mr Major on facilitating private-sector
involvement in infrastructure projects is designed to emphasise that the
recovery strategy is looking to the long as well as the short term. There
will be other wheezes to emphasise the partnership between government and
industry.
The shift in policy will be seen as a defeat for those in the cabinet - Mr
Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Heseltine among them - who have been arguing
that sterling should re-enter the ERM sooner rather than later.
Mr Major judged that there was little prospect of limiting the Tory
rebellion against Maastricht if backbench MPs believed attempts to shadow
the D-Mark were holding up interest rate reductions. But the pro-ERM lobby
was aware also that its case would remain unheard in the government as long
as the economy remained mired in recession. Mr Major is still on their side.
So recovery is a shared political priority in a government that has seen its
authority shredded. The risk is that by relaxing policy too quickly and by
too much, Mr Major will sow the seeds of the next unsustainable boom. But in
present circumstances the prime minister has calculated - probably correctly
 -that worrying about events one or two years hence is a luxury he cannot
afford.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Backbench Tory MPs express guarded relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RELIEF was almost palpable. Tory backbenchers used to treading
delicately through a minefield of bad economic news had something of a
spring in their step yesterday after Mr John Major's new emphasis on
achieving economic growth.
'Smile - the world's a happier place,' was the euphoric reaction of one MP.
Beyond the immediate buoyancy produced by the prime minister's positive
tones, however, the Tory ranks are far from united over economic policy. The
question of cuts in interest rates and the linked issue of sterling
re-joining the exchange rate mechanism still has the ability to divide the
Conservative troops and could disrupt the passage of the Maastricht bill.
Mr John Whittingdale, the MP for Colchester South and Maldon and a former
adviser to Lady Thatcher, said: 'I am delighted to hear what the prime
minister said and hope it will soon be followed with a cut in interest
rates.'
Others called for a further, swift, 2-point reduction in interest rates  -
'presented properly this time', said one MP, in a barbed reference to the
negligible impact on economic confidence of the 1-point cut last Friday.
Mr Terence Higgins, the former chairman of the all-party Treasury committee
of MPs, welcomed Mr Major's words, without placing too much reliance on
further interest rate reductions. He said that the committee had repeatedly
emphasised 'the need to complement monetary policy with action which will
lead to the direct creation of jobs'.
There was caution from some MPs about the risks of importing inflation if
interest rates were cut so far that sterling fell. Some highlighted the
confidence-boosting effects simply from talking about growth, while others
emphasised capital public spending as the engine for recovery.
Whether the government's words are accompanied by the deed of reducing
interest rates is critical for the Commons discussion of the bill ratifying
the Maastricht treaty, because of its impact on sterling's re-entry to the
ERM.
The mood at Westminster was sharply divided. Some saw the receding
likelihood of the UK going back into the mechanism as underlining the
'irrelevance and anachronism' of the treaty, while others, on both sides of
the Euro-divide, said that moves towards recovery would ease the passage of
the bill, simply because MPs would feel less anxious.
One Euro-enthusiast was even confident enough to comment that what he
admitted was 'the enhanced implausibility' of the Maastricht treaty's
provisions on economic and monetary union as a result of the change of
emphasis would not be a problem.
What he saw as a result of more MPs feeling more comfortable with the bill
was seen by another Euro-enthusiast in a somewhat less cheerful light.
Mr Peter Temple-Morris, MP for Leominster, said on BBC radio: 'I think that
there is a worry which is slightly going beyond whether one happens to be
for particular aspects of the European Community or against them, and that
worry concerns really the survival of the government.'
In spite of his appeal for loyalty, many Euro-sceptics were undeterred, and
even encouraged. With the prospect of divisions ahead, yesterday's bloom of
backbench optimism may yet fade if there is little early sign of economic
recovery.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Major's confused economic policy shifts in emphasis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUESTION: When is a U-turn not a U-turn?
Answer: When it is a change of emphasis.
That, at any rate, was how the Treasury attempted yesterday to explain the
latest twist in UK economic policy since sterling's abrupt departure from
the European exchange rate mechanism on September 16.
According to Treasury officials, the disclosure by Mr John Major, the prime
minister, in a series of television interviews on Tuesday night that the
government intended to build 'a strategy for growth' with further declines
in the cost of borrowing and a shielding of capital spending projects from
this year's tough public-spending round was not a new departure in economic
policy.
Low inflation - and the recently announced target of keeping underlying
inflation in a 1 per cent to 4 per cent annual range during this parliament
 -remained at the heart of economic strategy.
Where the Treasury did depart from past policy guidance was in saying that
the government will attach particular importance to the interests of
industry in the current public-spending round. Efforts will be made to
sustain capital spending projects with the aim of boosting business and
consumer confidence while holding public spending within the Pounds 244.5bn
total planned for 1993-94. The offset will be fierce pressure to keep
public-sector pay rises under tight control.
Treasury officials indicated that, barring upsets, the future path of UK
interest rates will be downwards from the 8 per cent base rate level set
last Friday. They emphasised, though, that interest rate decisions would be
made by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, after weighing carefully all the
financial indicators, including money supply growth, asset prices and the
exchange rate, that currently determine UK monetary policy.
Although the Treasury's public-relations team was able in that way to
explain how a government apparently determined to bear down on inflation two
weeks ago had now made stimulating growth its main priority, there was
little doubt that the tone of Mr Major's remarks had unsettled some Treasury
officials.
While the emphasis on growth won support in the City in view of the weak
state of the UK economy, some economists expressed concern that the UK might
be reverting to the old pattern of rapid expansion followed by sudden
clampdown in economic policy-making.
'We are back on some sort of rollercoaster,' said Professor Geoffrey Dicks
of the London Business School's economics department.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers in London, said the
economy needed lower interest rates in particular given the weakness of
private-sector demand in the economy. But the government would have to be
prepared to tighten policy to curb inflationary pressures once there are
signs that the economy is moving ahead at a steady pace.
The UK, Mr Saunders explained, seems to suffer from a structural imbalance
that can be addressed only through higher taxes or lower public spending.
When the economy achieves sufficient growth to bring the public-sector
finances into balance, it overheats and begins to suffer from accelerating
inflation. Conversely, the economy can operate with low inflation, but only
at the cost of running a large fiscal deficit.
Mr Simon Briscoe, a UK economist at Midland Montagu, welcomed the new
emphasis in policy and the prospect of a further fall in bank base rates
from 8 per cent. 'A week ago, we were bewildered at the absence of rate cuts
and had foreign clients ringing up asking why the government was not cutting
rates,' he said. He believed that an Autumn Statement announcing a tight
fiscal policy would provide an appropriate opportunity for a further
lowering of interest rates. Such action would be justified by the depressed
state of the economy.
According to Mr Briscoe, the government's measure of underlying inflation -
the retail prices index excluding mortgage interest payments - might show
year-on-year growth of above 4 per cent at times in the months ahead as
sterling's devaluation affected the prices of imported goods. But beyond the
next six months, weak economic conditions meant little danger of underlying
inflation breaking upwards out of a 3 per cent-4 per cent range.
A similar judgment probably underlay Mr Major's decision on Tuesday to
highlight the need to end the recession. The Treasury, though, was anxious
to point out positive signs such as stronger-than-expected retail sales in
the third quarter and low unit labour costs.
Confusion about UK economic policy remains. Its future course will have to
be judged by the actions, rather than the words, of policymakers.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Retail sales edge up but business stays muted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL SALES were slightly higher last month but business on Britain's high
streets remains restrained, official figures indicated yesterday.
A 0.2 per cent rise in sales last month compared with August took the volume
of retail sales to their highest level since March last year, when spending
jumped ahead of the rise in value added tax. Compared with a year ago, sales
were 1.5 per cent higher.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said retail sales were now on a 'clear
upward trend', but analysts warned that it was too early to talk about a
sustained recovery on the high streets.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist at Salomon Brothers, said: 'The rise in
sales does not change the broad picture of a weak economy with strong
disinflationary pressures.'
Central Statistical Office figures show sales in most sectors were either
flat or marginally higher last month, compared with August.
Household goods sales fell by 1 per cent, reflecting the particularly weak
nature of the housing market in September. Sales by department stores rose a
sharp 1.3 per cent compared with August.
Over the three months to the end of September, retail sales rose by 0.6 per
cent compared with the previous quarter and were 0.8 per cent higher
compared with the same three months a year ago.
Mr Lamont said the figures confirmed the message of a recent survey by the
Confederation of British Industry that 'talk of doom and gloom in the high
streets is much overstated'.
The same CBI survey, however, pointed out that retailers fear a reversal of
September's gains this month.
Although household goods sales fell month-on-month, they rose by 3 per cent
in the three months to September compared with the previous three months,
reflecting a slight strengthening of the housing market before stamp duty
was reintroduced on August 20. Compared with the same three months a year
ago, sales of household goods rose by 5 per cent.
Clothing and footwear sales rose by 2 per cent in the three months to
September compared with the previous three months. Food sales fell by 0.5
per cent over the three months to September but were 0.2 per cent higher
than a year ago.
Economists do not expect sales to recover before the end of year because of
the damage done to confidence by 'Black Wednesday' and the ensuing
government turmoil.
In the longer run, however, the recent cut in base rates to 8 per cent
should boost consumer spending.
Mr James Barty, UK economist at Morgan Grenfell, said: 'Consumer confidence
collapsed towards the end of September, which won't act as much
encouragement to retail sales.'
He continued: 'The overall trend for consumer spending remains really quite
flat.'
Business confidence in Northern Ireland has declined dramatically, results
of a survey by the province's Chamber of Commerce and Industry indicated
yesterday.
Most of the 250 firms questioned in September before the currency crisis
believed the economic climate would remain bleak for the next 12 months.
Managers of companies employing 65,000 workers saw little chance of profits
improving and expected growth to tail off in the next year.
Confidence among manufacturing companies nose-dived to minus 4 per cent in
the third quarter from plus 54 per cent in the spring.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Recession in construction industry deepens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recession in the construction industry deepened over the summer,
according to figures published yesterday showing a further fall in orders.
According to the Environment Department, UK construction orders fell by 10
per cent during the three months to the end of August, compared with last
year.
A separate survey by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors of almost
150 estate agents in England and Wales, said that the housing market
remained in a deep slump.
The only comfort was a slight increase in interest from first-time buyers.
Two thirds of agents reported a fall in house prices during the quarter to
the end of September. Less than 1 per cent said prices had risen.
According to the Environment Department, orders for private housing fell by
14 per cent compared with June, July and August last year. Private
commercial orders were a quarter lower and private industrial orders were 8
per cent lower.
The National Council of Building Material Producers warned yesterday that
its latest state of trade survey, due to be published on Friday, would
confirm 'the current appalling state of the construction industry.
'There are ominous signs that the industry is now facing a deeper recession
and that the situation is very much worse than had been anticipated.'

FT  22 OCT 92 / Clinton tiptoes around trade issue: The Democratic candidate
says he will not rubber-stamp any Bush administration pacts if he gets to
the White House. But, what will he do?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE, Gatt and oilseeds subsidies are nowhere near the top of the political
agenda for Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate in
the US. But, if he emerges victorious on November 3, these issues may well
leap rapidly to the forefront.
While Mr Clinton has repeatedly stressed his support for a Gatt agreement,
he has been cautious about making commitments. A campaign spokesman would
say little beyond issuing a warning that, if elected, the new president
would not present to Congress just any agreement negotiated by the
Republican administration of President George Bush.
Mr Clinton himself, in Monday's presidential debate, put it this way: 'I'll
have a free and fair trade policy, a hard-headed realistic policy, and not
get caught up in rubber-stamping everything the Bush administration did.'
One Clinton adviser suggested, at the time of the North American Free Trade
Agreement (Nafta), that Mr Clinton's handling of the pact should be seen as
a model of how he would approach others agreed by the president.
Mr Clinton has supported Nafta in principle since he launched his campaign,
despite the strong opposition of labour. Ignoring sniping from Mr Bush, who
accused him of "waffling' on the Nafta, he refused to commit himself on the
details until he had read the entire negotiated text.
Then, on October 4, Mr Clinton delivered a long and thoughtful speech -
largely his own, according to aides - which concluded that free trade with
Mexico was desirable only if accompanied by a national economic strategy.
'Too many Republicans would say that it's a simple issue, freer trade always
equals economic growth,' he said. 'Some Democrats would say that freer trade
today always equals exporting jobs and lowering wages. Well, it sure can if
you don't have a comprehensive economic strategy to maintain a high-wage,
high-growth economy."
He said that, besides having a 'comprehensive strategy' (education, worker
training, investment incentives), he would seek to negotiate three
supplemental agreements to rectify Nafta's 'shortcomings."
They would:
Establish an Environmental Protection Commission, headed by Mr Al Gore, his
party's candidate for the vice-presidency, 'with substantial powers and
resources' to prevent and clean up water pollution and to encourage the
enforcement of each country's own environmental laws.
Establish a commission for worker standards and safety with 'extensive
powers' to educate, train and develop minimum standards, and with dispute
settlement powers and remedies.
Ensure that a country could take protectionist steps to deal with
'overwhelming' import surges.
In this speech, Mr Clinton did more than resolve his own doubts about Nafta;
he was heeding pleas from the Mexican government to refrain from calling for
a renegotiation of the commercial deal. He was also seeking to satisfy the
con cerns of Congressman Richard Gephardt, majority leader in the House of
Representatives, and his key supporters in labour, and the environmental
movement.
On Gatt, Mr Clinton is said to be concerned about satisfying the original US
goals of the Uruguay Round, as expressed in the 1988 Trade Act.
These called for reform of agriculture trade 'to the maximum extent
feasible,' but the emphasis was on ending 'trade-distorting subsidies' and
reducing farm surpluses - a far cry from the total elimination of production
and export subsidies first proposed by the Reagan and Bush administrations.
A Clinton administration could decide to go back to the drawing board on its
position on farm trade reform. Among the farm groups supporting Mr Clinton
is a number wanting to retain US protection for commodities such as sugar,
peanuts and dairy products.
The 'worker rights' issue, which has been ignored by the Bush
administration, also figures prominently in the Gatt round objectives
approved by the US Congress.
Under these, US negotiators were supposed to 'secure a review of the
relationship of worker rights to Gatt articles  .. with a view to ensuring
that the benefits of the trading system are available to all workers.'
Mr Harry Freeman, executive director of the MTN Coalition, which business
has organised to get a new treaty passed by Congress, believes Mr Clinton
would seek to expand the scope of Gatt to 'non-traditional areas' like
workers' rights, human rights and environmental concerns.
He said: 'This may be to the chagrin of other Gatt members who think Gatt is
to be purely a commercial thing.' Mr Freeman also thinks Mr Clinton would
seek 'strong allies in other countries which could cause a schism within
Gatt'.
It is understood that Mr Clinton is sympathetic to some US industry
complaints about the proposals for final settlement of the Uruguay Round
drawn up by Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, in the areas of
investment, intellectual property rights, services and dumping. However, it
is impossible to gauge the extent to which Mr Clinton would be willing to
risk an unravelling of the Uruguay Round in order to satisfy these concerns.
Like most politicians, Mr Clinton has vowed to get 'fair trade' as well as
'free trade', but he has also promised not to subordinate US trade interests
to political and security relationships as many US presidents have done.
He is unlikely to want his first 100 days as president burdened by a need to
push through unpopular trade agreements negotiated by his predecessor.
He could ask for an extension of the president's negotiating authority, due
to expire on March 1 next, and a new Congress dominated by his Democratic
party might give it to him.
In the meantime, the trading partners of the US seem to be calculating the
probability of a Bush defeat, and assuming that there is nothing to be
gained by negotiating a deal with a president who is too anxious to get one
while he can.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Perot disdains to speculate on his intentions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY morning the news agencies publish a useful item called the daybook,
which lists scheduled events in the nation's capital and, throughout this
year, the itineraries of the presidential candidates.
Yesterday the listings for President Bush in the south, Governor Clinton in
the mountain states and their running mates and wives were exhaustive. Under
the names Ross Perot and James B. Stockdale, the independent ticket, there
appeared, as most days: 'No public events scheduled'.
There were hints from Dallas that before election day Mr Perot would appear
at some political rallies in the week ahead. But these intimations are worth
little, since the only person who takes decisions about this campaign is Mr
Perot, and he does not deign to speculate to the media about his intentions.
His vehicle, as it has been throughout, is television. This has meant the
three debates, in which he was, in order, distinctive, muted and caustically
accusatory, especially against President Bush. At the very least he made his
presence felt, which is more than can be said for poor Admiral Stockdale,
out of his depth in the vice-presidential slugfest.
It also means paid-for half-hour advertised programmes, plus a fistful of
standard short political commercials. The first, which he advertised in the
debates as Jerry Brown once did his toll-free phone number, are
old-fashioned and homespun, just Mr Perot with his charts and a pointer. The
second, in which only a photograph of him appears, are slickly professional.
Mr Perot has already spent about Dollars 35m of his own money on his effort;
he said on Monday that by the time it is over he will have forked out
Dollars 60m. Not a penny of it, he repeatedly reminds his television
audiences, has come from the taxpayer, unlike the Bush and Clinton
campaigns.
His relations with the media are virtually non-existent. After Monday's
debate, he launched a tirade against the press that made Vice-President Dan
Quayle's constant complaints seem complimentary. He claimed reporters 'hate
the fact that I am in the race' and 'have less respect in this country than
Congress'. He called Time Magazine 'a joke'.
One consequence of the nature of this new, closed and totally personal
campaign has been the almost total absence of further revelations about how
he made his money, ran his business and investigated people who crossed him,
all of which were given full airing in the summer, much to his fury.
Sticking to the principle of delegating nothing, he even took Mr Orson
Swindle, the very conservative director of his organisation, United We
Stand, America, to task for daring to suggest that a vote for Mr Clinton
would be 'a disaster'. This, Mr Perot said, was 'a serious mistake' and in
no way reflected his views.
Though more critical of Mr Bush, for whom he often displays a visceral
contempt, there is no evidence that Mr Perot is warming to the Democratic
candidate. On Monday he belittled Mr Clinton's record in Arkansas, which he
likened to that of a corner store operator, and was dismissive of his
economic policies.
Freed, by his own decree, of the necessity of normal political discourse
outside the debates, Mr Perot is, in effect, running a one-issue messianic
campaign, on reduction of the deficit and the national debt. This is both
the source of his appeal, because it is a genuine public concern, and his
weakness, because of the public sense that the presidency is more
complicated than that.
His standing has risen as a result of the debates, roughly doubling to 14
per cent, but the perception that he could win, which seemed fleetingly real
earlier, remains confined to his true believers. But he is getting some
vindication: no one now is calling him 'a quitter'.

FT  22 OCT 92 / California given top quake warning
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CALIFORNIA Office of Emergency Services has issued its first-ever 'Grade
A' earthquake warning, its highest grade of alert.
The office said late on Tuesday there was a significant likelihood that an
earthquake rated six on the Richter scale would occur on the San Andreas
Fault near Parkfield within 72 hours.
Parkfield is a hamlet in the hills overlooking the west side of the San
Joaqun Valley in central California, about 170 miles south-east of San
Francisco.
It has a population of fewer than 100 people but claims to be 'the
earthquake capital of the world'.
Although its reputation was somewhat dented by the deadly Loma Prieta quake
that shook northern California in 1989, the town has a long history of a big
quake about once every 22 years.
The last was in 1966, so the next is overdue.
Parkfield is the site of the world's largest experiment in earthquake
prediction. A 25-kilometre segment of the fault there bristles with Dollars
19m worth of monitoring equipment installed by the US Geological Survey and
geologists from several universities.
In 1985, the USGS issued its first earthquake prediction, saying there was a
95 per cent chance that a quake rated six on the Richter scale would occur
before 1993 near Parkfield.
On Monday night, Parkfield was shaken by a quake of 4.7 on the scale. USGS
seismologists believe this may be the precursor of a more powerful tremor.
The USGS says its instruments point to a 15 per cent chance of a significant
earthquake in the area during the 48 hours from yesterday afternoon.
Such an event could provide scientists with invaluable clues on how to
predict earthquakes reliably.

ARGENTINE economy minister, Mr Domingo Cavallo, has admitted for the first
time that the country faces a trade deficit of 'up to Dollars 1bn' this
year. He had consistently denied that Argentina would see such a deficit in
1992, forecasting instead a small surplus or equilibrium.
However, dining with businessmen on Tuesday, Mr Cavallo recognised that,
while exports remained steady, imports were surging to a forecast Dollars
13bn in 1992 and leading to the country's first annual trade deficit since
1981.
'Of course this deficit worries us. We do not want to enter a period of
trade and current account deficits,' he said. The government is now working
on a package of measures to improve Argentina's international
competitiveness.
The minister explained that free market policies had set off a consumer boom
and heavy capital inflows, driving imports up by 60 per cent. Last year,
Argentine exports were worth Dollars 11.96bn and imports Dollars 8.09bn,
giving a trade surplus of Dollars 3.87bn.
However, imports began to outstrip exports last November. The latest
available trade figures show Argentina stayed in deficit until May, when it
reported a Dollars 160m surplus.
The government says there is no reason to panic, public finances being
sound, inflation low and productivity and investment increasing. But most
Argentine companies have poor management, obsolete technology and no
aggressive export strategy.
Industrialists say an overvalued currency and inexorably rising domestic
costs are making it impossible to export profitably. Manufacturing exports
are declining and exports of unprocessed raw materials increasing, they say.
Business leaders are bitterly critical of Brazil, Argentina's largest market
and a partner in the Mercosur common market. They accuse Brazilian companies
of flooding Argentina with artificially cheap products. A Brazilian official
countered: 'Argentina has an overvalued currency and excessive demand. In
Brazil, the problem is the opposite.'

ONE OF Canada's most influential businessmen entered the constitutional fray
yesterday. He urged his countrymen to end the 'paralysing and debilitating'
debate on the constitution and vote 'Yes' in next Monday's referendum on a
package of reforms known as the Charlottetown Accord.
Mr Paul Desmarais, head of Power Corp of Canada, said the accord was a
unique opportunity to give Canada a political and economic framework to face
a fast-changing inter-dependent world.
In an editorial in La Presse, French Canada's most important daily newspaper
and owned by Power Corp, Mr Desmarais urged Canadians to put aside petty
politics and see the deal as 'a consensus among 13 governments and four
aboriginal groups, each answerable to its electorate and public opinion'. To
continue the 30-year search for constitutional perfection would just be
utopian.
'The accord gives everyone significant gains and Canadians and Quebeckers
will continue to benefit from participation in the federation. No province
or group is compromised and it is an equitable agreement. Quebec's place in
the federation is assured.'
Mr Desmarais, Ontario-born and educated, built his financial services,
communications and industrial empire from Montreal. He said Canada had to
end the constitutional crisis now and work to restore a productive and
world-competitive economy. Otherwise, it could not maintain its social and
political systems intact.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Easing Mexicans away from inflationary inertia: Damian
Fraser analyses a fine-tuning of the peso
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cornerstone of Mexico's economic and political policy over the past five
years has been a stable exchange rate: a strong peso has kept the
dollar-conscious middle classes happy, put downward pressure on inflation,
and persuaded otherwise nervous foreign investors to finance the burgeoning
current account deficit.
Thus the government is extremely wary at portraying the decision on Tuesday
to raise the maximum rate at which the peso can slide against the dollar
from 20 to 40 centavos a day (2.3 per cent to 4.6 per cent a year) as a
devaluation. It is merely, goes the official government document, 'an
amplification of the band' in which the peso can fluctuate, and gives the
government more flexibility in managing the currency.
In one way the government is right. While the current exchange rate ceiling
(the maximum rate at which investors sell pesos for dollars) of 3,155 pesos
to the dollar will now rise by 40 centavos a day, the floor (the minimum
rate at which investors buy pesos) will stay fixed at 3.056.
Since the free rate is set by the market and varies between these
parameters, it is possible - although now less likely - that the free
exchange rate will be as strong or stronger next year than it is now.
However, the new flexibility given to the government in currency matters
suggests a subtle change of emphasis away from the exchange rate in Mexico's
economic policy.
'We think that international markets are demanding more flexibility in
exchange rates,' a government minister told reporters after the
announcement. 'International markets have been more volatile and the
rigidities of the old band could have provoked dangers.'
The minister hinted at a softening of the commitment to a fixed dollar. 'The
exchange rate has been used to fix inflationary expectations,' he said. 'We
are now in a different stage since the inflationary inertia has been broken;
the exchange rate is not as valuable as it once was.'
Such comments may reflect the buffeting the peso has suffered in recent
weeks, and even concerns that interest rates are too high. The free peso
last week came close to its ceiling.
Investors, influenced by events in Europe, and by Mexico's troubling high
current-account deficit and inflation rate, appeared worried about the
possibility of a devaluation and a subsequent collapse of the government's
economic policy. Interest rates on 28-day Treasury bills reached a year-high
19.7 per cent last week, partly reflecting such concerns.
The government seems instead to be hoping fiscal policy and wage moderation
will bring inflation down. Under the annual wage and price accord negotiated
between the business and labour sector, the government announced the minimum
wage would rise by just 7 per cent next year, and that contractual wage
rises, much more important in the economy, would be kept to single digits.
This was the first time the accord had restricted non-minimum wage
increases.
Also, the government announced petrol prices would increase by 0.79 per cent
a month (or 9.9 per cent a year), and electricity bills by 0.57 to 0.79 per
cent a month.
This is intended to have two effects: first, by phasing in increases over
months, the government hopes to avoid the traditional year-end bubble of
government-controlled price rises that has done much to keep Mexico's
inflation in double digits; second, to raise government revenues in real
terms, and tighten fiscal policy.
The government is expected to announce in November plans for a budget
surplus in 1993 similar to the 0.7 per cent of GDP aimed for this year.
'If you put all these measures together, we hope to reach an inflation
target of 7 per cent,' says another government official. 'The measures are
sufficiently strong to allow us a little breathing space on the exchange
rate.'
The financial markets have reacted favourably on the view that a credible
exchange rate policy has been laid out for the next 12 months, which should
avert the danger of a large one-step devaluation. The peso was strengthened
after the announcement, and the stock market rose 2 per cent yesterday
morning after rallying 3 per cent on Tuesday.

IRAQI President Saddam Hussein last night appeared to have scored a partial
victory in his diplomatic battle with the United Nations, as the world body
bowed to his terms for the delivery of relief aid.
The US reacted with indignation to an accord, negotiated between Iraq and UN
officials in Baghdad, which would further restrict UN control, but Britain
and France were said to be ready to accept the terms.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, told the Security
Council yesterday that the agreement should be signed and implemented
'without further delay'. But he acknowledged that it did not fully meet what
he termed UN aspirations, and he promised to continue efforts to strengthen
the UN presence in Iraq.
President George Bush yesterday ordered the release of some Iraqi assets
frozen in the US to be used to pay for UN weapons inspections and
humanitarian aid in Iraq.
Reuter adds: Two days after Mr Bush had denied, in a TV debate, that US
technology went into Baghdad's nuclear programme, the State Department said
yesterday that Dollars 15m of US parts had indeed been found in Iraq.

<TEXT>
THE US and the European Community said yesterday they wanted more
clarification of China's trade policy regime before pressing ahead with
negotiations on the terms of Chinese membership of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade (Gatt).
Addressing the Gatt working party charged with drawing up China's protocol
of accession to the world trade body, Tong Zhiguang, vice-minister for
foreign trade in Beijing, said his government hoped for an early resumption
of Gatt membership.
China's firm decision to move to a market economy, endorsed by the 14th
Communist Party Congress which ended earlier this week, would bring the
economic system closer to Gatt principles, Tong said. The government was
also committed to reforming the trading system in accordance with Gatt
rules.
China had already acted to release state-owned enterprises from central
control and liberalise prices, he added. Price reform would be completed
within three years. China was also ready to reduce customs tariffs,
eliminate other import restrictions, and increase the 'transparency' of its
foreign trade regime.
In return for allowing Taiwan to apply separately for Gatt membership, China
has been promised expedited negotiations on its own 1986 application to
resume the Gatt seat it left in 1950 after the Communists took power.
These negotiations were suspended in 1989 after the brutal suppression of
the pro-democracy movement and a slowing of economic reform. The working
party met again last February but made little progress.
US and EC officials said yesterday they wanted to know more about how a
'socialist market economy' would work in practice.
They also wanted more information on the bilateral accord struck by China
and the US earlier this month, which in some respects could serve as a model
for the Gatt protocol.
China will have bilateral talks with trading partners on tariff reductions
and other issues, before the working party reconvenes tomorrow to consider
its next moves.

<TEXT>
THE Australian government yesterday announced measures to protect workers'
savings in pension funds. They follow the introduction in July of a
compulsory national savings scheme that will see pension funds controlling
ADollars 900bn (Pounds 380bn) of Australian savings by the year 2000.
The plan, to be phased in from next July, includes a compulsory levy on all
pension funds to repay members of a fund that goes broke or suffers from
fraud.
Mr John Dawkins, the federal treasurer, said that central to the measures
was the requirement that all funds be incorporated or have the provision of
pensions as their dominant activity.
This would bring all funds within the reach of the strengthened Insurance
and Superannuation Commission, which will have the power to remove trustees
and take representative action on behalf of fund members.
The government is also forcing funds to diversify their investments by
reducing the limit on in-house assets from 10 per cent to 5 per cent.
Members are to be allowed greater involvement in their funds' activities.
From July 1995, all funds with five or more members will be required to have
equal employer and employee trustee representation.
The savings scheme introduced in July requires employers to pay 9 per cent
of their payroll into a pension fund, and employees to pay 3 per cent of
their salaries to a fund by the year 2000.
The Australian government has set up a company to market new Australian
technology, most of which has ended up being commercialised overseas in the
past, Reuter reports from Canberra. 'Australia has a well merited reputation
in the research area for clever people creating world class technology,' Mr
Don Bourke, chairman of the government-owned Australian Technology Group,
said yesterday

FT  22 OCT 92 / De Klerk to override parliament on amnesty
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR F W de Klerk, the South African president, yesterday decided to force
through a bill which will allow him to grant secret amnesty to security
force members for apartheid crimes, after the bill was rejected by the
segregated parliament.
It is the first time that Mr de Klerk has acted to overrule parliament since
he took office in September 1989, and demonstrates the fact that he is under
heavy pressure from his own security forces to provide such amnesties before
a multiracial interim government takes power, probably some time next year.
Earlier in the day, Mr de Klerk suffered a humiliating defeat when Indian
legislators blocked the bill in parliament. The president said last night he
would refer the bill to the multi-party President's Council, a section of
the executive branch of government which is dominated by the ruling National
Party.
The President's Council was designed to overcome exactly the circumstances
that arose yesterday: defeat of the ruling party in one of the non-white
houses of the three-chamber parliament (the 308-seat parliament debates
jointly, but legislators vote separately according to race). If a bill is
defeated in any house - white, coloured or Indian - it cannot become law
without being referred to the Council.
Mr de Klerk is likely to be sharply criticised by opposition parties for
frustrating the will of parliament.
ANC officials said yesterday they did not expect the bill to prove a major
obstacle to constitutional negotiations, arguing that it was unnecessary to
oppose individual amnesties granted now, as a multiracial interim government
would immediately cancel all such pardons or indemnities.
Mr de Klerk claims that the legislation is necessary to complete the release
of political prisoners from the African National Congress (ANC), but legal
experts dispute this, believing its main aim is to indemnify the security
forces from prosecution.
Liberal Democratic party spokesman Mr Tony Leon said the bill represented a
'charter for crooks, criminals and assassins'.
'It massively widens the net of assassins, bombers, terror ists, necklace
murderers, state killers and others in this rogue's gallery of South
Africa's terror who will now qualify to walk away from their deeds unnamed,
undis closed and unpunished,' he said during the parliamentary debate.
The African National Congress yesterday said a Swiss firm was planning to
sell South Africa training aircraft in what would be a violation of the
international arms embargo, Reuters reports from Johannesburg.
'The ANC is aware that arrangements are being made by a Swiss aircraft
company to sell Pilatus trainer aircraft to the South African Defence
Force,' a statement said.
'These aircraft are meant for the training of fighter pilots and are a
violation of the arms embargo.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday gave China until the end of
the year to accept his proposals for the colony's political development or
to present alternatives that would be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong.
After more than six hours of discussions with Lu Ping, director of the
Chinese cabinet's office of Hong Kong and Macao affairs, Mr Patten said: 'I
cannot say we reached a meeting of minds on what I put forward.'
He also indicated that they achieved little progress in settling the impasse
over the financing of Hong Kong's new airport project. Mr Patten said that
they had agreed the best forum for settlement was the Airport Committee of
the Anglo-Chinese Joint Liaison Group - a place where consensus has been
stalled for months.
This is Mr Patten's first visit to China as governor of Hong Kong. He leaves
for the colony tomorrow after discussions today with Chinese trade
officials.
It emerged last night that Li Peng, China's prime minister, had refused to
see him. Instead he will meet Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister.
On October 7, Mr Patten presented plans for the conduct of the colony's 1994
local and 1995 legislative elections which provide for much greater
democracy than has previously been the case in Hong Kong.
In considering alternatives to these plans, the governor said he was guided
by three principles. They should be 'fair', 'open and honest', and
'acceptable to the people of Hong Kong', he said.
Mr Patten said that he was prepared to meet Lu 'at any time and in any
place' to reach agreement but had reminded the Chinese they had only until
the end of the year.
He said the legislative timetable demanded that bills be put before the
Legislative Council (LegCo), the colony's unicameral legislature, early in
the new year to give effect to the planned changes for the 1994 and 1995
elections.
Although Mr Patten did not say so yesterday, he has suggested in the past
that he would be prepared to introduce his proposals for a slightly faster
pace of democratic development in Hong Kong without China's approval.
He went out of his way, however, to praise Lu - the man who holds day-to-day
responsibility for ensuring a smooth transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong
in 1997. He lauded the manner in which Lu put forward China's position but
was less than pleased with what he had to say.
Mr Patten would give only few details of Lu's response to his proposals. He
said that Lu pointed out the existence of the Basic Law - the
Beijing-drafted constitution for Hong Kong post-1997. (This has become
Chinese code for 'no change'.)
'I am bound to say I don't think this answers some of the problems I have to
disentangle before the end of this year,' the governor said.
His visit has been preceded by a barrage of criticism of himself and his
proposals, in the pro-Beijing Hong Kong press, not seen since the Cultural
Revolution of the 1960s and early 1970s.
Mr Patten's defeat in the British parliamentary election earlier this year
has been used to suggest he is a failed politician.

The announcement was made by Mr Ken Harada, 73, a respected elder of the

doors to try to achieve consensus on the appointment.
However, Mr Obuchi's rivals, who back Finance Minister Tsutomu Hata as Mr
Kanemaru's heir, put off a decision on whether to accept the choice, NHK
television reported.
Mr Obuchi, 55, a former LDP secretary-general, could inherit extensive
influence in Japanese politics if he can avoid a break-up of the faction.
However, there has been much public criticism of the closed-door
horse-trading involved in his selection.

A GROUP of former civil servants and politicians have formed a front to
campaign for multi-party democracy in Malawi, according to the official
Malawi News Agency (Mana), Reuter reports from Blantyre.
The United Democratic Front brings together several former top members of
Malawi's sole legal party, the Malawi Congress party, who over the years
fell foul of self-declared Life President Kamuzu Banda's unchallenged rule.
The agency quoted a UDF statement as welcoming Mr Banda's announcement on
Sunday that a referendum would soon be held in Malawi to decide if the
country wanted pluralist politics. But the UDF said Mr Banda's government,
in power since Malawi's independence from Britain in 1964, had to ensure
adequate time was allowed for a nationwide debate on the merits and demerits
of one-party and multi-party politics.
Other conditions included equal access to state-run media by those
campaigning for and against one-party government and international
monitoring of the referendum.
Mr Orton Chirwa, a leading opponent of Malawi's President Banda and the
country's first attorney-general, has died in a Malawi prison, an opposition
spokesman said yesterday.
Mr Chirwa and his wife Vera had been in prison since their abduction from
Zambia in 1981. They had gone into exile in Tanzania following an abortive
cabinet revolt against Mr Banda and his policies in 1964.

A BRITISH tourist was killed and two wounded yesterday when gunmen opened
fire on a tour bus near the southern Egyptian town of Assiut - a hotbed of
Islamic extremism.
An official in Assiut said the woman tourist had died of wounds in hospital.
The incident could hardly be a worse advertisement for Egypt's lucrative
tourist industry expected to be worth some Dollars 3bn this year.
Tourism is easily the hard-pressed country's main foreign exchange earner.
Yesterday's shooting followed a similar episode earlier this month when
Moslem militants fired automatic weapons at a Nile cruiser with German
tourists on board.
Egyptian police said that gunmen ambushed the tour bus near the town of
Dayrut, some 270km south of Cairo. Dayrut has, for months, been the focus of
a bitter feud between Islamic militants and security forces, marked by
persistent violence.
The Egyptian government has been battling a resurgent Islamic movement whose
activities were brought into sharper focus by the recent earthquake, with
the authorities accusing fundamentalists of seeking to exploit the tragedy
for political purposes.
Disturbances on the streets of Cairo last weekend, apparently inspired by
Islamic militants and in which government relief efforts were openly
criticised, have been regarded as an ominous development.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World Bank to decide fate of Narmada dam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE World Bank's executive board is due to meet tomorrow to decide on the
fate of the controversial Sardar Sarovar dam projects in India's Narmada
valley, amid unrelenting criticism of the projects' impact on the
environment and on the inhabitants who will be forced off their land.
The World Bank had already responded to criticism of Sardar Sarovar by
commissioning an independent report from Mr Bradford Morse, a former
administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, and Mr Thomas
Berger, a former Canadian Supreme Court judge.
The Morse-Berger report was scathing in its assessment of the project, and
in particular of the measures provided to resettle displaced farmers, and
the World Bank then revised its position by drawing up a new plan called
Next Steps.
But Mr Morse and Mr Berger have now castigated Next Steps for ignoring or
misrepresenting their findings.
'The Bank may choose to reject our findings. India may choose to ignore our
report. It is clear, however, that the Bank's Next Steps document has sought
to present a version of our report that is at variance with the report
itself,' Mr Morse and Mr Berger told Mr Lewis Preston, the World Bank's
president, in a letter last week.
This strong criticism has upset the Bank's efforts to build an executive
board consensus behind the Next Steps approach to the Dollars 3bn Narmada
dam and associated canal and drainage works - the aim of which is to provide
irrigation and drinking water to some 30m people in western India.
Construction had been under way on the Sardar Sarovar projects since 1987,
but the Morse-Berger review recommended halting work until proper
environmental studies had been carried out and new resettlement plans
prepared for the estimated 240,000 people who may be displaced by the
projects.
Work has been temporarily held up by the Indian flooding season, but the
World Bank's Next Steps plan would continue construction while the studies
are carried out.
'The idea that environmental impact studies would be done as construction
proceeds undermines the prospect for achieving environmental protection,' Mr
Morse and Mr Berger wrote.
While they found the resettlement proposals of the Gujurat state government
inadequate, they are particularly critical of the revised plans of
neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, which they say are designed to encourage those
ousted by the projects to move to Gujarat.
'We believe the gap between Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat policies is
continuing, and that, as our report explained, this erodes the right to
choice by oustees in Madhya Pradesh,' they say in their letter to Mr
Preston.
Some Bank executive directors had hoped that the Morse-Berger report would
provide an adequate umbrella against criticism of Sardar Sarovar and allow
them to press ahead with the projects, which have been strongly pressed for
by the Indian government.
However, in the face of continuing criticism from Mr Morse and Mr Berger,
directors are under growing pressure from their home countries to vote
against continuing to finance Sardar Sarovar.

weight

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community should negotiate as a bloc the civil aviation accords
each member state now agrees bilaterally with non-EC countries, the European
Commission urged yesterday. In this way it could achieve the widest access
for its own airlines.
The recommendation is made in Brussels' long-mooted plan for a common
aviation policy. It argues that the 600 existing bilateral agreements would
stand, but that the EC's strength as a unit should be used to redress
lopsided arrangements between Europe and other countries, in particular, the
US.
The current free-for-all risks 'pitting one member state against another,'
said Mr Karel Van Miert, EC transport commissioner, putting at risk the
Community's own air transport liberalisation programme and restructuring of
the depressed airline industry.
In September, the Netherlands concluded an 'open skies' agreement wih the
US, giving KLM, the Dutch carrier, virtually unrestricted access. France,
Germany, Britain and Belgium are now attempting to reach similar
arrangements, in what Brussels sees as an American 'divide and rule'
strategy.
Mr Van Miert said US airlines already had 19 'fifth freedom' rights inside
the Community - allowing them to carry passengers from, for example, Munich
to Brussels - whereas no EC carrier could pick up and deliver passengers
inside the US. Similarly, American carriers operated 139 routes between the
US and the EC; Community airlines only 97.
'We are not the protectionists,' Mr Van Miert said, 'there is a clear
imbalance there.' If Delta airlines could use Frankfurt as a European hub,
EC airlines should be able to do the same inside the US from, say, Dallas or
New York.
In the scramble for market access, said Mr Van Miert, big airlines like
Lufthansa, which previously had felt able to look after themselves, were
coming round to the idea of negotiating from a position of greater strength
through the Community. The EC council of ministers has resisted ceding any
competence to Brussels in external aviation negotiations. But officials here
now believe it may reconsider.

<TEXT>
US and British defence chiefs said yesterday they wanted to reverse recent
legislation that could prevent nuclear weapon tests after 1996.
The UK, which uses test facilities in Nevada, would be bound by the US ban.
A bill signed into law this month imposed an immediate nine-month moratorium
on nuclear testing in the US, followed by a limited programme up to
September 1996.
The US is understood to have allocated three out of the 15 tests permitted
in the limited programme to Britain, which is anxious to test new safety
features in warheads for its Trident nuclear deterrent.
The temporary moratorium followed similar measures by France and Russia.
speaking after a Nato ministerial meeting, but said President George Bush
had felt he had no alternative but to sign it.
A limited number of tests was necessary to ensure the reliability of
weapons.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, UK defence secretary, said it was highly desirable to
continue testing. The US law allows for the ban to be lifted if other
nuclear powers undertake tests after 1996.
The Nato ministers approved new consultation and planning guidelines for the
use or threatened use of the alliance's remaining nuclear weapons.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general, said the new guidelines reflected
a reduced reliance on nuclear arms for the alliance's security.
Nato's stockpile of non-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe has been cut to
less than 1,000 warheads, a fifth of the level of six years ago. Withdrawal
of warheads from all ground-based short-range weapons and from naval
tactical weapons was completed ahead of schedule this summer. The remaining
arsenal of aircraft bombs is also being cut.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations yesterday suspended the international airlift to Sarajevo
as fighting broke out between Moslems and Croats north-west of the besieged
Bosnian capital.
UN officials said the clashes between troops who had been nominal allies in
the Bosnian conflict threatened the safety of flight paths used by relief
aircraft. They said it was uncertain when deliveries of food and medicine
would resume.
The suspension of flights came after the UN stopped road convoys from Split.
The only land access route now is from Belgrade.
Any prolonged suspension of relief flights will exacerbate the deteriorating
food situation in Sarajevo. The city's main flour mill was hit by four tank
rounds, destroying a key food source for the 380,000 people trapped for
seven months by a Serbian siege. An apparent dispute over the control of
Vitez, 60 miles north-west of Sarajevo, led to the collapse of the fragile
alliance between Moslems and Croats.
Croatian radio said five Croat soldiers and 17 civilians had been killed
when the two forces, formerly united against Serb fighters, clashed in the
mostly Moslem town in Croat-controlled territory. The UN sent an armed
convoy to Vitez to rescue relief workers.
Meanwhile western embassies in Belgrade yesterday accused Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic of failing to condemn ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, and
warned that UN sanctions would not be lifted until violence in Bosnia stops.
A statement by the EC, the US, and the Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), accused Mr Milosevic of not using his
influence to press Bosnian Serb forces into stopping ethnic cleansing or
atrocities in Bosnia. It warned that sanctions would not be lifted from
Yugoslavia until ethnic cleansing was reversed, and asked: 'What has Mr
Milosevic done to stop paramilitary fighters.'
It criticised Mr Milosevic for failing to dissociate himself publicly from
ethnic cleansing.
'The governments are appalled at the continuing evidence of human rights
abuses and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia-Hercegovina,' it added. The letter
named Bosnian Serb forces, who control 70 per cent of Bosnian territory, as
the 'principal offenders'.
It warned Mr Milosevic to heed the UN Security Council resolution on war
crimes of October 6, urging him to endorse publicly a commission of experts
who would 'ensure those responsible come to justice'.
Reuter adds from Vienna: Yugoslav Prime Minister Milan Panic said yesterday
he plans to hold a general election on December 13 to elect new federal and
regional parliaments and presidents. However, it is unclear whether Mr Panic
has the constitutional power to call elections.
Nato defence ministers meeting in Gleneagles, Scotland, yesterday said they
were ready to offer more help to the UN to bring peace to former Yugoslavia.
The ministers agreed to draw up military plans for a new peacekeeping role
by the end of the year. The alliance and the Western European Union have
sent warships to the Adriatic to monitor UN sanctions on Serbia.
Nato is also using Awacs surveillance aircraft planes to monitor airspace
over Bosnia.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US airlines threaten to sue over BA deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE three biggest US airlines yesterday threatened legal action if the Bush
administration approved British Airways' Dollars 750m acquisition of a 44
per cent stake in USAir without securing greater access for US carriers into
the UK market.
The warning reflected growing concern on the part of American Airlines,
United Airlines and Delta Air Lines that Washington is seeking a hasty
agreement with the UK over a new aviation pact to clear the way for the
BA-USAir deal.
The US carriers say the BA deal breaches foreign ownership rules for US
airlines by giving BA virtual control of USAir. BA has vigorously defended
its proposed deal, insisting it complies with all US regulations.
Mr Stephen Wolf, chairman of United Airlines, was expected to voice his
concerns to Mr Andrew Card, the US transportation secretary, who held talks
with Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, in London yesterday.
The US government is understood to be keen to reach an agreement with the UK
during this round of talks.
The US appears to have moved closer to the UK position by agreeing to phase
in open skies between the two countries.
The big US airlines argue that their government should first secure a
balanced open skies agreement with the UK before allowing BA to invest in
USAir.
'The issue is not that we oppose the BA deal: all we want are the same
benefits which BA will be getting,' a US airline official said.
The preferred solution for the big three US carriers is for immediate and
total liberalisation of air services between the UK and US. But in the event
of a phased liberalisation, the US carriers also want the BA-USAir
transaction to be phased.
This would involve imposing limits on the deal which would be gradually
lifted as liberalisation increases in the US-UK airline market.
The US airlines are also calling for the removal of restrictions on access
to London Heathrow airport in last year's bilateral agreement; the same code
sharing ticketing facilities which BA gained in the 1991 agreement; and
rejection of a UK proposal to establish a dispute procedure in any new
liberalised aviation regime which the US regards as another effort to
re-regulate the market.
The US carriers have also been worried by a US government offer to allow BA
rights to operate services from the US to third countries.
Despite the lobbying from the big three US carriers, the Bush administration
appears intent on resolving the BA issue before the November 3 election. It
feels the deal could help secure jobs and the future of USAir, the country's
sixth largest carrier.

FT  22 OCT 92 / World Trade News: UK wants action on airport slots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN called on its European Community partners yesterday to allow more
airlines to compete for landing slots at crowded airports.
Mr John MacGregor, UK transport secretary, said Britain was using its EC
presidency to press the case for a regulation, binding on member states,
that should help new airlines to secure scarce landing slots at crowded
airports.
The draft requires, for example, independent slot co-ordinators to be
appointed at congested airports. At most airports in Europe, co-ordinators
are employees of an individual airline, usually the country's flag carrier.
Co-ordinators control the slot allocation which depends on so-called
'grandfather rights': an airline which operates a slot one year has right of
first refusal on the same slot the following year.
Mr MacGregor said that EC-backed decisions were needed 'if the full benefits
of the liberalisation of air transport are to be realised.'
Airports most affected by slot shortages are Heathrow, Frankfurt, Milan,
Gatwick, Rome, Madrid, Copenhagen and Charles de Gaulle.

<TEXT>
WORLD TRADE reform talks broke down in Brussels last night as US negotiators
said the European Community had backtracked on compromises over farm
subsidies which had seemed likely to produce a breakthrough.
It is understood that a meeting has been called today at the White House to
discuss immediate imposition of Dollars 1bn (Pounds 623m) sanctions against
the EC's oilseed subsidy regime.
Pressure has mounted on President George Bush in recent weeks from US soya
producers and Republican congressmen for swift action on oilseeds and only
the prospect of a breakthrough in the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) has kept them at bay.
US negotiators said serious differences remained over the oilseeds dispute.
They said the EC had also backtracked on issues thought to have been settled
 -such as limits on the volume of subsidised EC farm exports.
The EC yesterday remained firmly of the view that the negotiations are not
yet over.
The EC-US dispute over subsidised farm trade has blocked progress towards a
Uruguay Round agreement for almost two years. At risk is a deal which could
add Dollars 100bn a year to world trade, providing a fillip to both
developed and developing economies.
The latest push was seen by a beleaguered President Bush as a last-ditch
effort to achieve a breakthrough that would win votes in the presidential
election on November 3.
Observers fear that if President Bush is defeated, which seems likely, his
Democratic successor will have no interest in pressing for an early
agreement.
Delay would put the entire Round at risk and would be likely to trigger a
number of simmering trade disputes - the most immediate of which is over
oilseeds.
A senior US official said yesterday: 'It appeared last week that both sides
had moved closer to an understanding that would enable us to achieve a
breakthrough on agriculture. It now appears that for internal political
reasons the Community is backing away from that understanding. This will
make it virtually impossible to conclude an agreement in the near future.'
The oilseeds row was the immediate cause of the breakdown but this had led
to a fraying of agreements tentatively reached last week on cuts in
subsidised cereals exports.
French refusal to see any cut in its lucrative cereals exports had cast a
shadow over the negotiations. Paris signed up in May to a reform of the EC's
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that is more restrictive than the subsidy
cuts called for by Gatt. But French officials last week said in Brussels
they did not believe the reform would work or be adhered to.
The European Commission, negotiating on behalf of the EC, nevertheless
intends to hold France to its commitments under the new CAP, said EC
officials in Brussels. They believe that any hope now of clinching a deal
depends on not reopening the CAP reform - the underpinning of any Gatt deal.
Much will also depend on the extent to which Germany is prepared to put
pressure on France, its closest ally, to reach a settlement.
On oilseeds, the US has made successive concessions towards the EC, which
insists that its internal farm reforms can bring output down to 9.5m tonnes
a year. It is understood that the US would 'look at a way of getting a
production outcome without looking at a specific production number'.
But an official said yesterday that the US had to have 'a mechanism that is
clear and understandable' and that would enable the administration to give
firm assurances to farm lobbies that a particular EC production ceiling
could be set.
'We are being asked to take the EC on good faith, and in all honesty there
is no trust that the EC will carry out any commitment on that basis,' he
commented.
The American Soyabean Association and two other oilseed grower groups
yesterday wrote to Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative 'totally'
rejecting the EC oilseeds proposal. 'It amounts to little more than a
sanction of current EC oilseed plantings and what the EC already plans under
CAP reform,' they said.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Sweden sees falling output until 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN HAS postponed hopes of economic growth until 1994 as a result of the
deterioration in the European economy and the costs of recent measures to
support the krona, according to Ms Anne Wibble, the finance minister
(pictured left).
Speaking in London yesterday after a presentation to bankers, Ms Wibble said
the Swedish economy was likely to decline by slightly more than 1 per cent
both this year and next.
Growth would resume in 1994, with an estimated 1 per cent expansion in
output, she said. However, if Sweden had abandoned its fight to avoid
devaluing the krona last month, the economic results would have been 'even
worse', she said.
'We are aware of the costs of going through a (currency) defence process.
But we look at this in terms of building up confidence for the future.' Ms
Wibble was in London to spell out to foreign lenders the effects of fiscal
and monetary action during the past six weeks to shore up the country's
financial position. She also had talks yesterday with Mr Norman Lamont, the
UK chancellor.
Despite action to reduce the budget deficit by annual amounts of up to
SKr42bn (Pounds 4.4bn) during the next few years, Ms Wibble said the deficit
would grow further in 1992-93 because of the effect of the recession on
revenues and spending.
The 1992-93 deficit would be 'substantially above SKr100bn', she said.
The government would also spend significant amounts to shore up the banking
system during the next few years through loan guarantees and possible
injections of equity capital.
Sweden has already taken specific action to aid Nordbanken, Forsta Banken
and Gota Bank, but is now trying to take more general steps to support the
troubled banking sector.
Although Ms Wibble admitted the negative effects of high Swedish interest
rates on the domestic economy, she said interest rates would now fall as
confidence returned.
She also shrugged off the effect on Swedish export competitiveness of the
recent devaluations of the currencies of Britain and Finland - two of the
country's leading trading partners. There were already signs of a recovery
of Swedish exports, she said.
The Riksbank (central bank) cut its marginal lending rate to 13.5 per cent
from 14.5 per cent yesterday, after earlier increasing it as high as 500 per
cent during the speculative assault on the krona last month.
Sweden has embarked upon a large-scale foreign borrowing programme to
bolster reserves depleted by last month's turbulence. This has resulted in
the Riksbank's reserves rising to around SKr150bn, Ms Wibble said. Sweden is
borrowing a total of SKr230bn under a plan announced on September 9.

<TEXT>
THE German government is facing a string of new demands on its central
budget to support the east German economy, including the cost of servicing a
DM50bn (Pounds 20bn) debt on public housing, subsidising house sales, and
promoting new investment.
Details were spelt out to the cabinet yesterday by a series of specialist
working groups, charged with proposing ways of speeding up recovery in the
former communist part of the country.
The government remains adamant, however, that there will be no tax
increases, and no compulsory investment loans, at least in 1993, in order to
finance the soaring unification costs.
What is no longer excluded within the ruling coalition is the possibility of
increased taxation, or some form of investment loan, in 1994 or 1995, when
the full burden of east German indebtedness will fall on the public
exchequer.
Immediate measures to bridge the gap must be found from cuts in other areas
of public spending, and in streamlining the bureaucracy relating to new
investment in the east, Mr Friedrich Bohl, minister of state in the
chancellor's office, said yesterday.
He said the cabinet had agreed in principle to an increase in the investment
subsidy for small and medium-sized enterprises in the east. The
recommendation is for an increase in the subsidy from eight to 25 per cent
for all enterprises employing fewer than 20 workers, at a cost to the
exchequer of DM30bn from 1993 to 1996. A final decision would come on
November 4.
The reports presented to the cabinet show that the central government is
prepared to take over responsibility for the east German housing debt, and
assume responsibility for the entire public housing stock, if it fails to
reach any agreement with the federal states on sharing the burden.
The housing working group has called for an extension of subsidies to help
sell housing, costing an extra DM200m in 1993 and 1994. A sum of DM20bn
which has been set aside for modernisation of public housing in 1993 has
already been exhausted, and requires a further DM5bn in subsidised credit
facilities, it says.
A further DM200m a year is called for to promote owner-occupation, and
special subsidies and depreciation allowances for new house-building should
be extended by two years.
The financial consequences of housing measures are estimated at between
DM2.7bn and DM5.2bn, for which, according to the working group, no
comparable savings measures can be found.
In addition, extra cash is urgently required for culture, sports, facilities
for young people, and for the care and repair of historical monuments,
according to a separate report.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Spanish steel reform derailed

<TEXT>
A KEY element of Spain's efforts to cut subsidies to state-run industry was
thrown off course yesterday, after the European Commission had failed to
approve a Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3bn) plan to restructure the country's steel
industry in a way that would maintain steel-making in the politically
volatile Basque Country.
In effect, the Commission has told Madrid to find further capacity cuts, or
cut the amount of state aid involved in the plan. Under strict EC rules on
state aid to the steel industry, the Spanish plan needs the unanimous
backing of member states. Commission support would increase the chances of
EC industry ministers approving the plan at their meeting on November 24.
The Spanish plan would cut steel casting capacity and jobs, and lead to the
decommissioning of seven blast furnaces. But in order to satisfy political
pressure from the Basques, the plan also calls for the building of the
world's largest mini-mill at Bilbao, to produce some 900,000 tonnes of
rolled flat steel a year there.
The Commission was deeply split yesterday on proposals from Sir Leon
Brittan, the competition commissioner, which would have blocked the new
steel plant.
The Commission said it considered the Spanish plan was 'viable'. But it said
the balance of aid and restructuring 'needed to be improved'.
Sir Leon, Mr Martin Bangemann, the industry commissioner, and Mr Jacques
Delors, the Commission president, will present the Commission's thoughts to
industry ministers. Meanwhile they are likely to consider the Spanish plans
in the light of the difficulties of the whole EC steel industry.
About 25,000 steelworkers aim to protest at the Spanish plan in Madrid on
Monday. Yesterday's decision will make the restructuring even more painful.
A general election must be held in Spain in the next 12 months; Basque and
Asturian support is vital to the hopes of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez for
re-election.

<TEXT>
MR VADYM HETMAN, the outspoken chairman of Ukraine's central bank, yesterday
renewed his crusade for a tighter monetary policy by lashing out at his
government's spendthrift policies. He also called for a postponement of
Ukraine's plans to introduce a separate currency.
A technocrat with a good reputation in western financial circles, Mr Hetman
said Ukraine must kick its inflationary habit of bailing out inefficient
state enterprises with government credit. Similar statements made over the
summer earned Mr Hetman a public rebuke from President Leonid Kravchuk.
According to government statistics, since January Ukraine has issued
unbacked credit totalling Rbs211.8bn to save faltering Ukrainian
enterprises.
Arguing that this soft credit policy meant Ukraine was exporting inflation
to Russia, last month Russia froze all payments from Ukraine, provoking a
furious response from Kiev. Mr Hetman yesterday took the unprecedented step
of siding with Russia on the payments issue.
He noted that Ukraine had come under criticism from the International
Monetary Fund for its piecemeal economic policy-making.
Meanwhile, Russia and Ukraine yesterday appeared to end a row over the cost
of gas which has disrupted supplies to western Europe when Ukraine diverted
them from storage tanks and domestic industry to the export market. A
statement from Ukrainian prime minister, Mr Leonid Kuchma, quoting gas
distributors Ukrgazprom, said deliveries of Russian gas to customers in the
west had returned to normal.
Germany's largest gas supplier, Ruhrgas AG, had said earlier that Russian
gas supplies were still 20 per cent below normal because of the row.

A CONTROVERSIAL EC proposal which the UK believes would probably kill trade

by a majority of EC countries.
The Directive on Used Machinery - now in its third draft - is intended to
apply much the same safety requirements to second-hand machinery as new
equipment will face under the 1989 Machinery Directive.
At a meeting in Brussels in June, seven member states objected to the draft
in principle, and only Spain and Italy supported it.
Mr Edward Leigh, UK trade and technology minister, yesterday said 'the

A CONTROVERSIAL EC proposal which the UK believes would probably kill trade
in used machinery looks likely to be quietly dropped after strong opposition
by a majority of EC countries.
The Directive on Used Machinery - now in its third draft - is intended to
apply much the same safety requirements to second-hand machinery as new
equipment will face under the 1989 Machinery Directive. This is designed to
secure free trade throughout the EC for machinery that meets the safety
rules.
If passed, the used machinery directive would require second-hand equipment
to be certified as continuing to comply with the safety rules each time it
was resold. But this has been criticised as completely impracticable and
unduly bureaucratic.
Mr Edward Leigh, UK trade and technology minister, told a London conference
organised by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers that second-hand
machinery was likely to pose hazards as great as, and perhaps greater than,
new machinery.
Even so, the UK government believed that the proposed legislation on new
machinery, on use of machinery at work and the existing general product
safety directive provided adequate safeguards, and that there was no need
for additional legislation.
'Furthermore the proposed directive would require checking and certification
affecting a vast number of often small transactions, and would in practice
probably kill the extensive trade in used machinery on which much of
industry depends.
'We have therefore opposed it all along and the latest indications are that
it will be dropped altogether.'
At a meeting in Brussels in June, seven member states objected to the draft
in principle, and only Spain and Italy supported it. The European Commission
is considering its position and an announcement is expected soon.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Murdered politician linked to Mafia
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PALERMO magistrates have for the first time directly linked a senior Italian
politician with Cosa Nostra, the umbrella organisation of the Sicilian
Mafia.
This follows a six-month investigation into the killing of Mr Salvatore
Lima, the Euro-MP, former mayor of Palermo and the most powerful Christian
Democratic political figure in Sicily. Palermo magistrates yesterday
announced the issue of 24 arrest warrants and said the murder of Mr Lima in
March was a result of his involvement with Cosa Nostra.
This is likely to be a deep embarrassment to the Christian Democrat party
and those of his colleagues like Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime
minister, who have publicly defended his reputation in the wake of his
murder.
The magistrates, relying on information mainly supplied by 'super-grasses',
claimed the killing was ordered by a number of Cosa Nostra families because
Mr Lima had promised - but failed - to use his political influence to good
effect. It is widely believed that Mr Lima had undertaken to ensure the
harsh sentences handed out to Mafia bosses in the trials of the mid-1980s
would be quashed on appeal.
The great missing element in the mass trials concerned the political links
of the Mafia. Such links have been widely suspected but never proven beyond
vote-buying and collusion over contracts.
Mr Lima, a parliamentary deputy from 1968 to 1979, had long been suspected
of Mafia connections and his name appeared frequently in the parliamentary
anti-Mafia commission records. Palermo magistrates suggested he had occupied
a key position in the shadowy world linking organised crime with the
political parties and state institutions.
Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, called a press conference yesterday
to deny that the government was watering down taxation measures in the 1993
budget.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Growth in German M3 accelerates: Rate cut hopes recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWTH in Germany's broad money supply accelerated again last month, but the
9.1 per cent annualised rate of expansion in the M3 measure was well below
the range of 10 to 12 per cent forecast by economists.
Provisional figures, published yesterday by the Bundesbank, also included
some encouraging signs that demand for domestic credit is falling
appreciably.
The bank noted that growth in M3 - which includes cash, current accounts and
short-term deposits - in the first half of the month had been relatively
weak, picking up speed in the latter half, when it was strongly influenced
by the Bundesbank's heavy intervention during the European exchange rate
mechanism crisis.
Despite these indications, the independent central bank, which has recently
reduced the importance it places on money supply as a factor in
policy-making, moved yesterday to damp hopes of an early reduction in
interest rates.
A variable rate securities repurchase tender, through which the bank
supplies funds to the domestic money market, resulted in a minimum rate of
8.75 per cent, compared with the previous fixed rate of 8.90 per cent.
Even though this continued the downward trend in short-term money market
rates, which is still expected to lead eventually to cuts in the Lombard and
discount rates, the market was disappointed by the scale of the reduction.
Observers were also confused by the money supply figures. According to Mr
Thomas Mayer, an economist at Goldman Sachs in Frankfurt, the fall in the
expansion rate of domestic credit to 9.5 per cent compared with 11-12 per
cent over the past six months was 'marginally encouraging'.
But he warned that the full effects of the bank's money market interventions
were not clear and could take some time to filter through.
He agreed with other German market watchers who claimed international
optimism about early moves on Germany's main interest rates was over-blown.
The underlying growth in money supply is still well above the bank's range
of 3.5 per cent to 5.5 per cent and inflation is still not under control.
Optimism was further dampened by a reminder from Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a
member of the bank's policy making central council, that German rates might
even rise.
German savers have deposited DM30bn (Pounds 12bn) in Luxembourg savings
accounts in the first nine months of the year - all but DM4bn out of the
total DM34bn saved in investment funds over that time, the BVI association
of investment companies reported yesterday, David Waller writes from
Frankfurt.

FT  22 OCT 92 / EC prepares tougher policy on asylum: Victims of civil war
or torture may be excluded
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC MINISTERS have made progress on an agreement to toughen policy towards
illegal immigrants and bogus asylum-seekers in response to the current
refugee crisis in Europe.
The new policy would apply a narrow test of whether asylum-seekers are 'in
fear of persecution', as defined under the 1951 Geneva convention.
Victims of civil wars or those raped or tortured by repressive regimes would
most likely be excluded, expanding EC efforts to close the asylum door into
the Community.
The refugee crisis in Europe has deepened this year as a result of civil
wars in former Yugoslavia, and economic dislocation in eastern Europe.
Germany alone has taken more than 220,000 asylum seekers from Bosnia, more
than any other country apart from neighbouring Croatia.
EC immigration ministers are due to consider a draft declaration at a
meeting in London on November 30. The document would not have the force of
law, but as a political statement of intent it could pave the way for a new
international convention on the treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees. It
is due to be highlighted in the BBC radio programme Opinion today.
Despite some reservations among EC member states with liberal refugee
policies - notably Germany and Denmark - EC and UK officials said yesterday
that a consensus has emerged on the need to harmonise how members treat
asylum requests.
Using the 1951 Geneva convention as the foundation, the aim is to isolate
'manifestly unfounded' applications for refugee status. This would help to
unblock the huge backlog in, say, Germany which has led to racist attacks on
asylum-seekers waiting to be processed, an EC official said.
Another aim is to discourage the international movement of refugees by
making those travelling between continents generally ineligible for official
refugee status in Europe. Although each application will be treated on
merit, UK officials said the Community wants to crack down on 'refugee
tourists'.
A third goal is to encourage groups suffering under repressive regimes to
seek redress in their own courts for human rights violations - a stand which
could technically restrict, for example, Kurds from Turkey.
Britain, which takes a tougher line than most of its EC partners, is leading
the debate as EC president.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Autumn Statement to pave way for interest rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, EMMA TUCKER and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT underlined yesterday its determination to present next
month's Autumn Statement as a springboard for economic recovery, paving the
way for a further cut in interest rates.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said the 'tight'
spending package being thrashed out by cabinet ministers would underpin
market confidence in the government's approach while preserving its priority
capital spending programmes.
That stance was echoed by Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, who responded
to last night's narrow government victory over coal closures with the
comment that the government's policy was to 'go for growth and recovery out
of this recession'.
But Mr John Major's decision to switch the emphasis of his strategy towards
ending the recession brought a mixed reaction on financial markets. The
pound fell sharply while share prices were boosted by the prospect of lower
borrowing costs.
The Confederation of British Industry welcomed the priority given to
recovery but demanded a more 'coherent' economic policy. It called for lower
interest rates and 'stringent' controls on public spending. The Institute of
Directors welcomed Mr Major's stance for providing 'fresh hope for
recovery'.
News of another small rise in the volume of retail sales last month left
financial markets uncertain about the short-term direction of the economy.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said sales on Britain's high streets were
now 'on a clear, upward trend'. But many economists continued to predict
that weak consumer confidence would hinder recovery.
The government's policy shift - announced by the prime minister on Tuesday
night and underlined yesterday by senior officials in his Downing Street
office - led to confusion in Whitehall.
Mr Lamont bluntly denied there had been any U-turn. Treasury officials
sought to dismiss suggestions that the government was taking a more relaxed
view of the inflation outlook in favour of a further easing of monetary
policy.
However, senior Downing Street officials repeatedly emphasised the strong
disinflationary pressures already apparent in the economy, pointing to the
weak employment market, unprecedented falls in house prices and depressed
consumer confidence.
This background would do much to offset the inflationary pressures from the
sharp devaluation of the pound since its departure from the European
exchange rate mechanism, Mr Major's aides suggested.
They disclosed that the prime minister had discussed the rebalancing of
policy with Mr Lamont last week and the broad outlines had been set out to
the cabinet earlier this week.
Senior ministers said the Autumn Statement - with the prospect of a further
cut in German interest rates - should provide scope for another reduction in
British interest rates in the second half of next month.
Prospects of a lowering of base rates sent the pound sharply lower on the
foreign exchanges.
The pound lost 3 3/4 pfennigs in London to DM2.4325, although it picked up
in New York to DM2.4449. Against the dollar it was more than a cent lower at
Dollars 1.6145 in London and eased further to Dollars 1.6060 in New York.
Share prices were boosted by hopes of further monetary relaxation, with the
FT-SE 100 index gaining 28.7 to 2,645.7, helped by rate cuts on the
continent.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Investment consortium puts Wilkinson Sword up for sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILKINSON SWORD has been put up for sale by Eemland Holdings, the consortium
of international investors which three years ago bought the shaving products
and toiletries manufacturer from Stora Kopparberg of Sweden.
Mr Mike Dowdall, Eemland chairman, said the decision had been taken because
the Swedish financial institutions which own half the company were unwilling
to fund further investment in Wilkinson's business.
Gillette, Wilkinson's biggest competitor in shaving equipment, owns 22 per
cent of Eemland, a Dutch registered company. Mr Dowdall denied that the
planned sale of Wilkinson was influenced by pressure from competition
authorities in several countries on Gillette to dispose of its stake in
Eemland.
Last year, Gillette was ordered by the British government to sell its stake
in Eemland after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation concluded
that the investment was anti-competitive.
Since then, German competition authorities have issued a similar order.
Gillette was also compelled by the US Justice Department in 1989 to reverse
its purchase of Wilkinson's US operations.
Gillette said yesterday that it expected the planned sale of Wilkinson to
resolve its outstanding problems with competition authorities.
Wilkinson earned operating profits of DM46.8m (Pounds 19.5m) on sales of
DM316.3m last year, of which about 85 per cent were in shaving products. It
is the second largest producer of blades in western Europe, after Gillette.
The company, which is more than 200 years old, has a manufacturing plant in
Britain and another in Germany, where it sells about half its shaving
products. It also has sales and distribution operations in the US.
Eemland, whose only asset is Wilkinson, said it had appointed Enskilda and
Goldman Sachs International to advise on the planned disposal. It expected
formal approaches to potential purchasers to be made in the near future.
Although discussions are understood to have been held with several possible
acquirers recently, they have reached no conclusion. Companies which could
be interested in Wilkinson include Bic of France and Colgate-Palmolive and
Warner-Lambert of the US.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Cabinet thwarts Tory revolt: Government makes extra
concessions to win vote over pit closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT succeeded last night in thwarting a revolt by Tory MPs over
coal pit closures after new concessions by Cabinet ministers.
The revolt, which at the start of the week looked certain to end in
humiliating defeat for the government, was curbed after Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, promised a 'genuine review' of the
UK's energy strategy.
He also offered a slight hope that the 10 pits excluded from the moratorium
on pit closures announced this week could yet be reprieved.
After a stormy Commons debate, a Labour motion was defeated by 13 votes. Six
Tories voted against the government and five abstained but the government
was helped by eight Ulster Unionist MPs abstaining.
The motion called for a moratorium on all 31 affected pits until the
completion of a full analysis planned by the all-party Commons trade and
industry select committee. A government amendment endorsing the Cabinet's
policy on the pits was approved by 320 votes to 305.
Winding up the debate, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, went out of his way
to give undertakings to possible opponents about the extent of the review -
including an assurance that Northern Ireland energy policy would be
included.
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Tory MP for Batley and Spen, was sacked as
parliamentary private secretary to a social security minister last night
after defying government whips.
The latest concessions were the culmination of three days of retreat. Mr
Heseltine had already offered, first, a delay and then extensive
consultations by his department on the closure programme. The case for
closure will now be scrutinised separately for all pits.
In spite of a bravura performance during the Labour- initiated debate, Mr
Heseltine's political reputation, and Conservative MPs' faith in the
sure-footedness of Mr John Major, have been damaged by the back-tracking
during the past week.
Mr Heseltine said the impact of legislation introduced by the government
which affected the markets for coal and electricity generation industries
would be covered by the review of UK energy policy. Subsidies for the
nuclear industry would also be included.
Mr Heseltine said the review by his department would be wide-ranging and
would consider evidence from all interested parties, including the trade
unions. Apart from evidence given in commercial confidence, as much as
possible would be made public.
The inquiry would be 'without restrictions' and have 'no pre-ordained
outcome', he said. Boyds, an international mining consultancy firm, would be
employed to give evidence on the viability of pits and the prospects for
British Coal. Mr Heseltine was pressed repeatedly by Labour MPs and rebel
Tories on the status of the 10 pits which British Coal has advised have no
prospect of being economically viable and are due to be shut down after a
statutory 90-day consultation period.
He replied that British Coal was compelled, during the consultations, not to
take any action which might prejudice the possibility of the pits continuing
in operation afterwards, 'and that means they have to indulge in the
appropriate care and maintenance in order to keep open that option'.
He sought, however, not to raise expectations too high, emphasising that
British Coal had advised him that the 10 pits were loss-making, and there
was 'no case' for waiting until the end of the general moratorium before
beginning the statutory consultation period.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, said Labour objected
to the government's review because it covered only the 21 pits included in
the moratorium and would be carried out by the government itself. He said
the government had no energy strategy and that ministers had created a 'a
nation united in anger'.

FT  22 OCT 92 / Bundesbank dents hopes of lower Europe-wide rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics and Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Bundesbank engineered a cut in a key money-market interest rate
yesterday, triggering a slight easing in credit policy in some neighbouring
nations but dashing hopes that Europe as a whole may be able to move soon to
substantially lower interest rates.
Although investors in the main European stock markets took heart initially
from the Bundesbank's action, shares later fell back on the realisation that
the central bank is unlikely to move quickly to reduce its internationally
important Lombard and discount rates.
This mood of pessimism was reinforced after Mr Reimut Jochimsen, a
Bundesbank council member, said expectations of lower German interest rates
were 'exaggerated' and that the central bank would continue to pursue its
traditional goal of achieving monetary stability.
In yesterday's operation, the Bundesbank moved its securities repurchase
rate from 8.9 per cent to 8.75 per cent.
That was quickly followed by reductions in official interest rates in
Belgium, the Netherlands and Austria, countries which are closely tied to
German monetary policy.
In Italy, the state-controlled Banca Commerciale Italiana became the first
Italian commercial bank to cut rates since early September, when it
announced a drop of three-quarters of a percentage point.
However, the cut in the German rate was smaller than some market
participants expected and failed to dent investor demand for the D-Mark,
which gained on sterling, the Italian lira and the French franc. The D-Mark
also edged up against the dollar which closed in London just over 1 pfennig
lower at DM1.5070. But the D-Mark later lost ground in New York to close
against the dollar at DM1.52245.
On stock markets, investors in Paris pushed up prices by about 1 per cent on
news of the Bundesbank's move, but shares later fell back for a slight
overall loss. Prices in Frankfurt and Amsterdam closed lower on worries
about the deteriorating European economy.
Indications that the Bundes-bank is unlikely to cut its main interest rates
within the next month or so were underlined by the announcement that
Germany's broad money supply accelerated again last month, a sign that
inflationary pressures sparked by unification are not yet under control.
Even so, the 9.1 per cent annualised rate of expansion in the M3 measure was
well below the range of 10-12 per cent forecast by many economists.
It comforted those hoping that a broad easing in German credit policy might
soon help to loosen borrowing conditions across Europe.

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WARREN TEA, a leading producer of Assam tea, has been given the job of
developing Vietnam's export of black CTC (crush,tear and curl) tea.
The Union of Tea Enterprises in Vietnam will be making available to Warren
four tea factories equipped with CTC machines to produce tea for the export
market. According to Mr Vinay Goenka, managing director of Warren, it should
be possible to produce about 3m kg of export quality tea at the four
factories located within a radius of 250 km (155 miles) of Hanoi. Warren
will be paid a commission of 4 per cent on export sales.
In preparation Warren has already produced samples of CTC tea at the
Vietnamese factories and these have met with the approval of tea tasters and
brokers in the UK and Germany, the two principal target markets. The
feedback from the brokers is that at first the European consumers may have
some reservation about the 'origin' of this tea. This will be largely
overcome if Warren can raise the quality of to a level that will allow it to
market the product under its logo, which is registered in the UK.
Warren will start exporting Vietnamese CTC tea in volume next season. Tea
plucking in Vietnam starts in mid-February and ends in November. According
to Mr Goenka, Vietnamese CTC tea should fetch at least 70 per cent of Assam
tea prices. The quality of Vietnamese tea leaf is good, but it has to be
ensured that the tea arrives at the factory gate in a 'healthy condition'.
Moreover, there has to be a greater degree of control over the entire tea
processing system from withering to packing, said Mr Goenka.
Warren has been told that it could also develop tea plantations in central
and north Vietnam where large tracts of virgin land are available. The Tea
Research Association of India has found the Vietnamese soil suitable for
growing good quality tea. The present production of tea in Vietnam is about
40m kg a year - most of it green tea, of which Vietnam is already an
exporter. The annual domestic requirement is about 18m kg.

J Sainsbury, the UK's biggest grocery chain, has cannily enlisted the
expertise of the former permanent secretary at the Department of the
Environment by appointing Sir Terence Heiser as a non-executive director.
Sir Terence's inside knowledge of the UK's planning policies will no doubt
come in handy to the supermarket chain as it continues to lay down new
stores at a furious rate. He becomes Sainsbury's fourth non-executive
director filling the position vacated by Lord Prior, the former Tory
minister, who retired at the last annual meeting.
Since his retirement this year, the 60-year-old civil servant, who headed
the DoE during the turmoil of the poll tax, may well have found more time to
indulge his passions for reading, walking and talking.
Unfortunately, he will have little time to talk to Lord Sainsbury about the
company before he hands over the chair to his cousin David in early
November.

FT  21 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: British Coal vows open mind on review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL will conduct consultations over its closure programme with an
open mind, the corporation insisted in the High Court yesterday.
Lawyers for British Coal gave the assurance as a legal challenge to the
proposed closures by the National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods, the pit
deputies (supervisors) union, was adjourned until November after the
government's change of direction in agreeing to consultation.
Mr Charles Falconer QC, for British Coal, said: 'We will embark on these
consultations in good faith and with a genuinely open mind. We reject
entirely the suggestion that we have been guilty of any breach of integrity
in the past or will be in the future.'
However, no false hopes should be raised - British Coal's present view was
that there remained a very strong case for the closures.
Mr John Hendy QC, for the unions, said they had no confidence that the
consultations would be genuine or that the results would not be pre-judged
by British Coal's activity or inactivity in keeping the mines viable, he
said.
Mr Hendy failed to win an assurance from British Coal that miners at 10 pits
threatened with early closure would be kept in work pending the outcome of
the 90-day consultation period.
The mining of coal at six of the pits involved in unions' action would have
stopped by the end of this week, Mr Falconer said. While the men would
continue to be employed, many would have no work and would be sent home.
The judge, Mr Justice Vinelott, said the recent changes in the situation had
removed much of the urgency in the case and the court would be reluctant to
reject the assurances given by British Coal.
A three-day hearing for the challenge to the proposed closures is scheduled
for between November 14 and 28.
Mr Mark Stephens, the unions' solicitor, said later that although there was
no longer any need for an emergency injunction, the miners would press at
the November hearing for court orders reversing the closure decision on all
31 pits.
A similar court challenge being brought by the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers will go ahead on Thursday as planned.

FT  21 OCT 92 / Bribery claims hit Labor in Australia
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MELBOURNE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE political integrity of Australia's ruling Labor Party was severely
damaged yesterday by the conclusions of an inquiry into allegedly corrupt
relationships between politicians and businessmen in Western Australia.
Two former Labor premiers of the state were criticised by a Royal Commission
appointed to investigate a series of business dealings known as 'WA Inc',
which are alleged to have cost taxpayers more than ADollars 1bn (Pounds
423m).
The most serious criticism was of Mr Bryan Burke, premier from 1983-1988,
who was found to have acted improperly in handling political donations from
businessmen, and in the 1987 rescue of an investment bank run by Mr Lauri
Connell, a WA entrepreneur.
The inquiry also criticised Mr Peter Dowding, who replaced Mr Burke as
premier and Mr Ray O'Connor, the last Liberal (conservative) premier of WA,
who was accused of accepting a ADollars 25,000 bribe.
The report is likely to prove highly damaging to WA's minority Labor
government, and to Mr Paul Keating's federal Labor government, which must
hold its seats in WA to win the next federal election, due by June next
year.
The six-volume report made no significant mention of federal politicians, in
spite of speculation that illicit campaign funds solicited in WA may have
helped finance Labor's 1987 and 1990 federal election campaigns.
However, the WA government did not release an appendix to the report dealing
with possible breaches of criminal law, which was sent direct to the state's
director of public prosecutions.
The Royal Commission said there was impropriety by politicians and public
officials in a number of areas, including the award of a casino licence and
a purchase by the state government of a mining company from Mr Alan Bond,
the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings.
The Commission is expected to produce a second report, in addition to its
confidential recommendations to the DPP, recommending substantial changes in
government procedures to prevent corruption, including strict restrictions
on political appointments to the public service.

turnover to DM52bn
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER at Allianz, the largest insurance group in Europe, will rise from
DM48.7bn last year to more than DM52bn (Dollars 36.8bn) this year, the
Munich-based company said yesterday as it announced half-year figures.
However, a number of factors, including Hurricane Andrew in the US as well
as an explosion of car theft in Germany, will ensure that mainstream
insurance business - before taking into account investment income - will
make losses this year for the second year in a row.
Profits from the group's investment activities - the book value alone of its
investments stands in excess of DM150bn - will compensate for the
underwriting loss on pure insurance business, meaning that overall profits
will be 'clearly positive', Allianz said yesterday.
As a result, the dividend for the current year will be held at the same
level as for 1991, at DM13.50 per share, Allianz said as it unveiled premium
income up by 5.1 per cent to DM27.4bn in the first six months of the year.
Allianz's shares have fallen a quarter from their high point in June this
year, driven downwards by disappointing 1991 figures released in late July.
Underwriting losses were DM1.78bn in 1991, compared with a profit of DM182m
in the previous year, a fact which markets chose to focus on rather than the
4 per cent increase in overall net profits to DM1.05bn. Hurricane Andrew,
which swept through a number of states in the US in August this year, is
likely to cost Allianz DM75m.
Losses at the Deutsche Versicherungs subsidiary in east Germany will improve
by DM200m this year, after DM625m last year. Domestic results have been hit
by a high level of industrial claims and a surge in car theft.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPLEX cross-border wrangle over the fate of Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligungs (AMB), Germany's second-largest insurance company, and BfG
Bank, its majority-owned subsidiary, has taken another twist.
A Frankfurt lawyer has launched a move to pressure Assurances Generales de
France (AGF), the French insurance company which has spent in excess of
DM1.1bn (Dollars 741m) to buy a 25-plus per cent stake in AMB, into making a
full takeover offer.
Mr Nicolaus-Jurgen Weickart is complaining that the interests of the
majority of shareholders in AMB have been neglected.
He has assembled a group of AMB shareholders - representing some 10 per cent
of the total - who object to the rapprochement between AMB and AGF. Last
July, a deal was reached whereby AMB abandoned its hostility to AGF and
agreed to recognise the voting rights on the majority of AMB's shares.
These agreements were reached by the supervisory boards of the two companies
over the heads of Mr Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, then the AMB chief executive,
and without reference to shareholders. Mr Baumgartl subsequently resigned.
Mr Weickart has put pressure on AMB to call a special annual general meeting
at which shareholders will be obliged to agree any sale of BfG and to
approve the giving of full voting rights to AMB. Given the likely opposition
of Fondiaria, the Italian insurance company which has 20 per cent of AMB, it
is possible that AGF and associated shareholders could be voted down at the
meeting, which is likely to take place around the turn of the year.

UNEMPLOYMENT in Russia is likely to soar to higher levels than those in east
European countries, according to a study just completed by the International
Labour Organisation, writes John Lloyd.
The report, which will form the backdrop to a conference opening today in
Moscow, covered over 500 enterprises employing more than half a million
workers. It shows that the decline in production and employment is
accelerating in every sector of industry.
Enterprises have cut around 15 per cent of their workforces in the past
year, according to the study, and nearly half those surveyed expect a
employment to fall further in 1993. The majority of enterprises said they
could maintain current output with an average of 18 per cent fewer workers.
Nearly 70 per cent of the enterprises surveyed planned to privatise
themselves in the coming year  - a change likely to lead to further loss of
jobs.
In addition, the report says, capacity utilisation in Russian companies fell
from around 83 per cent in 1989 to 75 per cent in mid-1992. Chemicals, basic
metals and engineering are the sectors most badly hit.
Mr Guy Standing, head of the ILO's East European office, said official
figures showing a 1-2 per cent unemployment rate in Russia grossly
underestimated the problem.

FT  21 OCT 92 / Fines for oil groups in French petrol row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S competition council yesterday imposed a total of FFr60m (Dollars
12.6m) in fines against the oil groups Shell, Esso and Elf Aquitaine, for
setting unfair conditions on sales of lead-free petrol to supermarket
chains.
This is the latest move in a long battle for shares in the petrol market
between French supermarkets and the oil companies. The battle has centred on
lead-free petrol, which has become far the fastest growing part of a
sluggish French petrol market.
Lead-free petrol sales have steadily grown from less than a percentage point
of total French petrol use in 1988, to 35.8 per cent of the total last
month, according to the French oil industry union.
The complaint against the three companies was lodged by Edouard Leclerc, the
supermarket chain which was the first to start selling petrol in the
mid-1980s and has led a price discounting battle.
The council threw out claims by Edouard Leclerc that the oil groups were
conspiring to drive up prices on sales to supermarkets, but it did find that
they were imposing unfair conditions such as exclusive purchasing.
Esso, which has since stopped this practice, was fined FFr10m. Shell, which
last year bought the petrol stations of Casino, another supermarket, was
charged FFr20m and Elf FFr30m. The council threw out complaints that Mobil,
Total and BP had also discriminated against supermarkets.
The head of France's second biggest union was forced to resign yesterday
under fire for a lack of leadership in the midst of near-record
unemployment, Reuter reports.
Mr Jean Kaspar, leader of the Confederation Francaise Democratique du
Travail (CFDT) since 1988, will be succeeded by national officer Nicole
Notat. The CFDT claims 575,000 members spread across industry and services.

<TEXT>
CRAY Research, the US computer maker, reported a sharp decline in earnings
for the third quarter after last week announcing plans to reduce its
workforce and consolidate operations.
Net earnings for the quarter were Dollars 6.5m, or 25 cents per share, down
from Dollars 28.1m, or Dollars 1.05 per share, in the same period last year.
Revenues rose to Dollars 220.1m from Dollars 205.5m.
The restructuring programme announced last week will save the company
Dollars 50m in 1993, said Mr John Rollwagen, chairman and chief executive.
The cuts will 'increase our competitive strength and profitability, and help
counteract the economic pressures felt from flat revenue and reduced profit
margins,' he said.
A Dollars 40m restructuring charge will be taken in the fourth quarter
resulting in losses for the quarter and only marginal profitability for the
year, the company said.
Revenues for the first nine months of 1992 were Dollars 570.3m against
Dollars 545.9m for the first nine months of 1991. Net earnings were Dollars
11.7m , or 44 cents per share, against Dollars 53.4m, or Dollars 2, for the
year ago period.

<TEXT>
BANGKOK Land, the property developer which became the largest company on the
Stock Exchange of Thailand when it was listed in February, has announced
plans to borrow SFr50m (Dollars 23.25m) through a new Cayman Islands
subsidiary to finance expansion.
In what one stockbroker called 'an exotic and expensive way of raising
debt', the Cayman company will issue Swiss franc notes for Swiss investors
with an annual interest of 4.5 per cent and maturity of five years, and then
lend the money to Bangkok Land after deducting expenses.
Bangkok Land, which named the trustee for the notes as DG Bank
(Switzerland), will itself act as guarantor of the issue and pay the
interest.
It will be possible for noteholders to convert the notes into Bangkok Land
shares before maturity, and 7.5m shares are to be set aside by major
shareholders for this. There are no plans to list the notes on any stock
market.
Bangkok Land, headed by Mr Anant Kanjanapas, one of Thailand's richest men,
also announced a 52 per cent rise in net profits to Bt2.27bn in the
half-year to September from Bt1.50bn (Dollars 59.4m) in the same period last
year. Net profits in the September quarter nearly doubled to Bt1.57bn.
Half-year sales rose 50 per cent to Bt7.67bn from Bt5.10bn, but some brokers
were disappointed by the results of a company they regard as a speculative
property play.
The market for office space and high-class residential property in Thailand
has softened this year, but Bangkok Land has concentrated on the more
buoyant low-income housing sector.
Its main project is Muang Thong Thani, a planned residential, commercial and
industrial satellite city near Bangkok's airport, is billed as the world's
largest private property development.

FT  21 OCT 92 / International Company News: Chemical Banking surges 35% in
quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER net interest revenues and an ability to contain the rise in bad debt
provisions helped Chemical Banking, the third biggest US commercial bank, to
turn in a 35 per cent increase in its third quarter net profits, to Dollars
282m.
The improved net, which translates into earnings per share of 98 cents,
against 95 cents a year ago, is in line with the better earnings achieved
earlier in the week by Chase Manhattan, another big New York-based bank.
Chemical, which was formed last year by the merger of Manufacturers Hanover
Trust and Chemical, said its bad debt provisions in the third quarter were
Dollars 330m, above the Dollars 313m of a year ago but less than the Dollars
345m of this year's second quarter.
Net loan write-offs totalled Dollars 330m, against Dollars 307m in the third
quarter of 1991.
Mr John McGillicuddy, Chemical's chairman, said the bank's results were
helped by a 15 per cent rise in net interest income, to Dollars 1.16bn, by
strong trading profits and by improvements in fee-based services.
He forecast a decline in both bad debt provisions and non-performing assets
'going forward'. Non-performing assets in the third quarter declined
slightly year-on-year, to Dollars 6.59bn from Dollars 6.66bn.
Mr Walter Shipley, Chemical's president, said the bank's merger-related
cost-cutting programmed was ahead of schedule.
The bank's Tier One risk-based capital ratio was a healthy 7 per cent at the
end of September, up from 5.6 per cent a year ago. That ratio reflected
Dollars 1.7bn in new common equity raised by the issue of stock last January
and by retaining Dollars 447m of earnings generated during the first nine
months of 1992.
For the first nine months of the year Chemical's net income was Dollars
782m, up by 36 per cent from the same period last year.
On Wall Street, Chemical's share price was marked Dollars  1/2 higher to
Dollars 33 3/4 .

<TEXT>
SMITH Corona, the US manufacturer of portable typewriters which is 48 per
cent owned by Britain's Hanson group, yesterday disclosed that it made a
Dollars 5.1m loss after tax in the three months to end-September.
The loss was scored on sales of Dollars 81.2m - slightly below the Dollars
87.2m seen in the same period of 1991 - and compares with a Dollars 4.1m
after-tax profit in the third quarter a year ago. The loss is, however,
struck after Dollars 9m of restructuring costs; these did not feature a year
ago.
Smith Corona put the blame on the general weakness in consumer spending. It
said that personal word processor unit sales in the US increased
'substantially' - partly because shipping problems depressed the figure last
year - but that overall domestic unit sales declined.

The accounting change contributed about 12 cents to per-share earnings in

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the world's third biggest pharmaceuticals company,
yesterday reported a 5 per cent rise in third quarter net earnings, to
Dollars 589m.
The modest improvement, struck on quarterly revenues 13 per cent higher at
Dollars 3.1bn, translated into earnings per share of Dollars 1.14, compared
with Dollars 1.08 a year ago.
For the first nine months of 1992 the group's net income was also 5 per cent
higher, at Dollars 1.62bn. Revenues were 7 per cent better at Dollars
8.77bn.
Mr Richard Gelb, chairman of Bristol-Myers, said international sales were
particularly strong during the quarter, recording a 24 per cent improvement
thanks to foreign exchange gains and 13 per cent without calculating the
effect of currencies. This compared with US domestic sales that rose 6 per
cent.
Mr Gelb said all four of the group's core businesses - pharmaceuticals,
consumer products, medical devices and nutritional products - had better
earnings in the quarter.
One-time restructuring charges caused Eli Lilly, the Indiana-based
pharmaceuticals group, to suffer a Dollars 268.5m third quarter loss. In the
third quarter of 1991 the company had a Dollars 297.5m net profit. Sales in
the quarter were 10 per cent higher at Dollars 1.48bn. Restructuring and
other special charges amounted to Dollars 519.6m.
Warner-Lambert, the New Jersey-based health care and consumer products
company, said its third quarter net earnings rose 14 per cent to Dollars
165m on record quarterly sales of Dollars 1.44bn, which were 10 per cent
better without accounting for currency fluctuations.

<TEXT>
THE Slovak government yesterday postponed for 'technical reasons' a project
to dam the Danube river and divert its water for the controversial Gabcikovo
hydroelectric power scheme, Reuter reports from Prague.
Damming was to have begun yesterday and, under the original schedule,
navigation of the river was to stop at midnight.
The postponement came amid a fierce row over the dam between Slovakia and
Hungary whose government says the project would pollute drinking water and
change the international border.
To try to defuse the dispute, Slovakia's environment minister, Mr Jozef
Zlocha, visited Brussels on Monday to seek European Community mediation. But
Mr Karel van Miert, environment commissioner, told him the Commission was
not ready to be a political mediator. He urged Mr Zlocha to avoid any
irreversible step to finish the dam.
The CSTK news agency quoted the government as saying new plans provided for
the river to be dammed by November 7. The director of Slovakia's state
navigation agency, Mr Karol Anda, told Reuter he had received no official
word.
The project, legacy of a 1977 pact between then-communist governments in
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, has severely strained their relations.

FT  21 OCT 92 / Clinton retains lead after debate: Bush fails to sway the
polls despite vigorous performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush gave it his best shot on Monday night. But there was
no immediate evidence, apart from the encouragement for his supporters, that
his vigorous performance in the final US presidential debate had turned the
electoral tide in his favour.
Four TV network polls found he was the least persuasive of the candidates.
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic contender, was adjudged the 'winner'
in two, Mr Ross Perot, the independent, in one, while the other had these
two tied. Only in the poll that gave the nod to Mr Perot was Mr Bush
reckoned to have done as well as Mr Clinton.
This confrontation saw some spirited exchanges, with all three attacking on
a variety of issues. The most eye-catching assaults, however, were launched
by Mr Perot on Mr Bush over his pre-Gulf war policies towards Iraq as well
as over Panama, the savings and loan scandals, the health of the banking
system, the North American Free Trade Agreement, foreign attempts to take
over US airlines, and Republican 'dirty tricks' in general.
Yesterday, a fortnight before the nation votes, Mr Clinton said he was
struck by the intensity of Mr Perot's criticisms of Mr Bush - 'he was really
mad'. He promised to continue in the final two weeks to hammer away at
economic issues, a strategy that has brought him leads of 12-18 points in
most national opinion polls and a commanding advantage at state level.
Mr Perot did not spare Mr Clinton, saying his economic policy - and Mr
Bush's - 'does not add up.' He also charged that Mr Clinton's record as
governor of Arkansas was 'irrelevant' as a qualification for the presidency,
while Mr Bush suggested it was an ominous warning for the country. Mr
Clinton sharply defended his stewardship of his state, which, he said, was
going in the right direction while the nation was not.
Mr Bush repeatedly said there was 'a dangerous pattern' to Mr Clinton's
behaviour of not speaking the truth and that he was, therefore, not to be
trusted in the White House.
Mr Clinton kept recalling Mr Bush's infamous 'read my lips, no new taxes'
pledge of four years ago and said that although Mr Bush was only too willing
to cede control of economic policy to his campaign chief, Mr James Baker,
'the person responsible for economic policy in my administration will be
Bill Clinton'.
This permitted the president one of his better interventions: 'That's what
worries me, he's going to be responsible.' Mr Bush admitted he made a
mistake in signing the 1990 budget act, imposed on him by a Democratic
Congress, but said Mr Clinton refused to admit he had made any mistakes in
governing Arkansas.
While Mr Clinton spoke in some detail of what he would do in the first 100
days of his presidency, Mr Bush fell back on the familiar litany of calling
for a balanced budget amendment, caps on mandatory spending and, of course,
no new taxes.

FT  21 OCT 92 / Tube staff could be moved to Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON Underground yesterday held out the prospect that it could move up to
2,000 of its staff into the troubled Canary Wharf development in London's
Docklands if this would help the Jubilee Line Tube extension to be built.
It said it had been considering its accommodation strategy for some time,
with the aim of bringing together staff currently housed in a number of
buildings on short lease around the capital.
Several of these leases were due to expire in the next few months. The move
to Canary Wharf now being considered would not only bring them together in a
single location but release a property in west London suitable for use as a
training centre.
This in turn would avoid the need for a new building for that purpose.
The move could help Canary Wharf's bankers in putting together a package for
the private-sector contribution demanded by the government towards the cost
of the Jubilee Line extension.
Previously, the banks' offer of funds had been conditional on the the
government relocating civil servants to Canary Wharf.
However, London Underground stressed that this was not a substitute deal
because the two were not linked.
The move was still under consideration, it said, 'but we will not go there
if the Jubilee Line is not built'.
The government's decision on the Jubilee Line extension is expected to be
taken by the cabinet this week.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Gas was accused yesterday of attempting to renege on the tariff
formula agreement introduced in April which has already produced two price
reductions for 18m customers.
In a speech to a London conference Sir James McKinnon, director-general of
gas supply, said the company's insistance on a wide-ranging reference to the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission was 'in the hope that an outcome would
emerge which was more favourable than the one the company had already signed
up to'.
He said the fundamental issue as competition increased was ownership of the
pipeline system, and a study had led Ofgas 'to question whether it would be
possible to operate a fair system if that system remains in the ownership of
British Gas'.

Some people may like Kiss of the Spider Woman. Since I did not, and so much
work has obviously gone into it, I shall try to make my remarks as objective
as possible in order not to undermine other people's pleasure.
It may be advisable not to sit too close to the front of the stalls. Spider
Woman is a very big musical, at least in its pretensions. The Shaftesbury
Theatre also has a large stage. The set is almost uniformly a prison with
metal bars, literally hundreds of them.
Yet the trouble with turning the stage into a prison is that you tend to
keep the audience out rather than invite them in. This is not a show full of
warmth.
There is a second motif in the spider's web. It has a similar effect to the
prison bars. This spider does not entice people in; it drives them away. It
is true that there is a smaller cell inside the larger prison. Here is where
the intimacy is supposed to take place.
The central relationship is between two prisoners, one a poor homosexual who
has been entrapped by a minor, the other a Marxist revolutionary familiar to
Latin American politics.
Gradually they become mutually dependent, eventually to like each other and
finally to embrace. The essential point of the relationship is that it is
micro and develops in a small space. It is anything but micro in Harold
Prince's production. Thus the main thrust of Manuel Puig's novel is lost.
Is anything valuable put in its place? The answer is no. There is a lot of
loud music by John Kander with lyrics (none of them memorable) by Fred Ebb.
Chita Rivera as the Spider Woman flits about much like the phantom in the
Opera.
At one stage there is a trip to what looks like the Brazilian jungle. The
Latin American police are shown to be crude in their methods. One of their
punishments consists of placing a metal bucket over a prisoner's head and
banging on it with metal rods.
There is also a touch of sentimentality. Molina, the homosexual prisoner, is
allowed to telephone his mother and does so with a song called 'Mama, It's
Me'.
The question I kept finding myself asking was why. What does the musical
treatment add to the story? The answer is worse than nothing; it detracts.
Spider Woman is a pastiche of the work of Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber and
Stephen Sondheim. It does not come off because it lacks a reason for
existence.
I also thought longingly of a couple of plays. If you want to see
homosexuality movingly portrayed on stage, remember Tony Kushner's Angels in
America at the National Theatre.
And if you want to explore brutality in Latin America, recall the treatment
in Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden. Throughout Spider Woman the latter
scarcely left my mind. Dorfman's piece is a low budget play which speaks
volumes. Spider Woman must have cost millions to ruin a story.
The one redeeming feature is Brent Carver as Molina. He acts, shows genuine
pain and genuine pleasure. He would be perfectly at home in Angels in
America. Here he is locked into a production unworthy of his talent.
The prison and the rest of the sets are designed by Jerome Sirlin.
