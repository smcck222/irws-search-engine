WEYERHAEUSER, the US forest products group, yesterday unveiled a 149 per
cent rise in third-quarter net earnings, reflecting high timber prices and
improved productivity.
For the three months to September 27, net income was Dollars 107.2m, or 53
cents a share, against Dollars 43m, or 21 cents, last year. Sales rose 6 per
cent to Dollars 2.34bn from Dollars 2.21bn.
The forest products division continued to benefit from more stringent
environmental regulations, which have curtailed the supply of timber from
public lands in the western US and swollen prices. Operating earnings for
the division soared 45 per cent to Dollars 103m.
Pulp and paper operations saw operating profits advance 23 per cent to
Dollars 61m, helped by better pricing of some products.
Nine-month earnings were Dollars 286.7m, or Dollars 1.41, on sales of
Dollars 6.88bn, compared with Dollars 94.4m, or 47 cents, on sales of
Dollars 6.57bn a year ago. Excluding the impact of an accounting changes,
earnings rose 84 per cent to Dollars 286.7m from Dollars 155.4m.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Pay offered by headhunters falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALARIES for people being headhunted for senior positions in industry are
falling, in a development that underlines the impact of the recession.
According to InterExec, a jobs-market consultancy, the average salary for
jobs for which headhunters were seeking UK-based candidates fell by about 2
per cent in both the second and third quarters of this year, compared with
the comparable periods last year.
InterExec also reported that vacancies which headhunters were trying to fill
were down 10 per cent in the third quarter, compared with the equivalent
period last year.
The findings mark the first time since InterExec started collating figures
four years ago that it has recorded a year-on-year drop for salaries for
jobs at director level.
InterExec's figures illustrate the slack demand for senior executives as
companies reduce their recruitment efforts because of the international
economic slowdown.
Another factor is widespread job shedding in top layers of industry, which
has increased the numbers of unemployed executives and depressed the degree
to which they can bid for higher salaries in a new job.
InterExec specialises in finding jobs for out-of-work managers through
linking up with headhunters.
It reckons its figures cover between a third and a half of all vacancies for
senior jobs for which employers are seeking UK-based candidates.
The company said that the average salary on offer to people being headhunted
was Pounds 50,272 in the third quarter.
That was a drop of 2 per cent from the Pounds 51,273 recorded a year before.
The year-on-year drop in salary in the second quarter was of the same order,
at 2.5 per cent.
In the first quarter there was a 2.5 per cent rise in salaries compared with
the same period last year.
InterExec says that in the third quarter headhunters were trying to find
candidates for 1,581 positions either in Britain or overseas.
That compares with 1,757 positions in the third quarter of last year, a 10
per cent drop.
The new figures from InterExec highlight a big reduction in efforts by
overseas-based companies to find UK managers for positions outside Britain,
based on headhunting methods.
In the third quarter, InterExec found out about 217 vacancies for overseas
jobs, 15 per cent down on the figure of 255 in the same period last year.
Taking into account only UK-based posts, 1,364 vacancies were reported in
the third quarter compared with 1,502 in the July-September period last
year, a fall of 9.2 per cent.
InterExec reported earlier that between the second quarters of last year and
this year UK vacancies fell 12 per cent.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Euro doubts 'put inward investment under threat'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of international companies are no longer considering locating their
headquarters in Britain because of uncertainties over the country's role in
Europe, according to a report published yesterday.
The study, compiled by Ernst &amp; Young, the international business advisers,
and Corporate Location magazine, says the UK's success in attracting
companies wanting a foothold in the European Community is under threat.
Its conclusions follow a recent warning from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, that Britain could lose its position as a favourite
location for inward investors into the EC unless it appeared to be an
enthusiastic supporter of the Community.
Mr David Rees, director of Ernst &amp; Young's European location advisory
service, said that by 'tending to be on the sidelines' of the European
debate, the UK risked presenting the wrong image to international companies.
He said a number of companies were no longer interested in acquiring a base
in the UK as such a decision would create 'the wrong impression about their
European credentials'. He added: 'If this uncertainty continues, then the
UK's considerable past successes in attracting a third of all US and
Japanese investment in Europe may be a lot harder to sustain in the future.'
The report emphasises that the UK remains an attractive location for
international companies in spite of strong competition. It is highly rated
for its telecommunications links, its good supply of labour with reasonable
skill levels and good physical communications.
The Commission for New Towns announced yesterday that it had raised Pounds
177.5m from the sale of property and land to the private sector during its
most recent financial year.
The total compares with Pounds 151.6m in the previous 12 months and with a
peak of around Pounds 300m at the height of the commercial property boom.
The commission, which disposes of assets previously held by the town
development corporations, said sales in 1991-92 were achieved 'in one of the
most difficult and challenging of all years' since it was established in
1962.
Sir Neil Shields, commission chairman, said the recession and its impact on
the property market had led to comparatively low levels of sales.

FT  20 OCT 92 / EC law 'will push up building costs'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE construction industry faces extra costs of Pounds 550m a year to comply
with European legislation which will make clients and architects jointly
responsible with contractors for building site safety for the first time in
UK law, the Health and Safety Commission said yesterday.
The commission said the regulations would reduce accidents by 33 per cent
generally and by 20 per cent on larger, safer sites. It published a
consultative document on the legislation, which must be implemented by the
end of next year.
That would benefit the industry by Pounds 220m a year, based on the 1991
industry output of about Pounds 37bn. The industry will also benefit from a
reduction in ill-health.
The construction industry employs 10 per cent of all European workers and
accounts for 30 per cent of all fatal accidents at work. In Britain, there
were 133 deaths in construction and 3,961 serious injuries reported from
April 1990 to March 1991.
Mr Stewart Campbell, head of the policy section of the Health and Safety
Executive - the enforcement arm of the commission, said: 'The legislation is
designed to aid safety co-ordination in a fragmented industry which has
moved towards many subcontractors on site and lots of self-employment over
the last 10 years'.
The two main areas of additional cost will be the responsibility of
architects to ensure designs do not endanger building workers, and the
responsibility of clients to appoint a planning supervisor and principal
contractor to produce a health and safety plan. The regulations are likely
to affect small, poorly managed contractors worst. Safety standards in the
better-run companies already reflect the regulations and they will incur
little cost, the HSC says.

FT  20 OCT 92 / US may try to defuse airline row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and the US are to begin a new round of talks in London today in an
effort to negotiate a more liberal aviation agreement between the two
countries to clear the way for British Airways' proposed Dollars 750m
(Pounds 436m) investment in a 44 per cent stake in USAir.
The UK last week tabled a set of proposals to liberalise air services
between the two countries gradually. But it has insisted that any new
bilateral deal would hinge on the US government first approving the BA-USAir
transaction.
The US has come under pressure from the three largest US carriers - American
Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Air Lines - not to approve the BA deal
unless they are granted greater access to the UK. They also want the US
government to secure a new 'open skies' agreement with the UK before
granting approval for the BA acquisition of a large minority stake in USAir.
US airline officials suggested yesterday that the US government was
apparently prepared to agree to some phasing in of 'open skies' between the
two countries as the UK has proposed. But it wants firm commitments and a
timetable for liberalisation. However, the US proposal is not expected at
this stage to lead to a breakthrough in the complex negotiations. Airline
industry analysts believe a third round of talks will probably be necessary
before an agreement can be reached. One US airline official said he did not
think there would be any agreement before the US election.
The US is also understood to be seeking change in the current BA-USAir
agreement because it says the present structure would give BA virtual
control of the sixth-largest US carrier. BA denies that, arguing that its
deal complies with existing US regulations. BA proposes to acquire 44 per
cent of USAir shares and 21 per cent of the airline's voting rights. Foreign
ownership of airlines is limited to 25 per cent of voting rights in the US.
The big three US carriers said they would not object to the BA transaction
if they could compete on the same basis against BA. They also said they were
urging their government to negotiate for immediate and total liberalisation
rather than a phased introduction of 'open skies'.
The UK has proposed a three-step approach: immediate liberalisation of US
services to UK regional airports; liberalisation of services to London when
the US relaxes its existing foreign ownership rules; and complete
liberalisation.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Maastricht debate 'very soon'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE paving the way for the return of the Maastricht Bill to the
Commons will be 'very soon', ministers indicated yesterday - which means the
bill could be back before MPs in mid-November.
In his statement to the Commons today on the European Community summit in
Birmingham, Mr John Major will announce the date for the debate - expected
next week - and underline his determination to take the legislation through
parliament.
Discussion of the Maastricht treaty at last week's cabinet meeting came down
on balance in favour of pressing ahead with the legislation to ratify.
The Foreign Office is keen to proceed, believing that continued delay is
debilitating and encourages Tory rebels.
While accepting the case for getting on with the bill, government business
managers will not commit themselves firmly to any particular timetable until
they see how the paving debate goes. The motion for discussion is likely to
be no more than a single line approving the return of the bill, first
debated by MPs in May.
Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, is said to have made it clear to colleagues
that proceeding with the legislation has to be taken seriously and that
ministers might have to cancel engagements to protect the government's slim
overall majority of 21.
The aim is to set aside solid weeks of parliamentary time to deal with the
bill - including weekend sittings - to ensure that the Euro-sceptics'
tactics of putting down hundreds of amendments does not prevent the bill
being passed.
An opinion poll of Conservative constituency chairmen has shown strong
grassroots support for the government's decision to press ahead with
ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
But the sample of 147 constituencies - 44 per cent of the 336 returning Tory
MPs - condemns Mr Major's administration for its handling of the economy.
The poll for ITN's Parliament Programme shows 71 per cent backing Maastricht
ratification, with 26 per cent against. Fourteen per cent backed a
referendum on the pact, with 86 per cent against.
However, when it came to the economy, 58 per cent of those polled expressed
dissatisfaction with the government's management against 40 per cent saying
they were satisfied.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Business outlook worsens in north
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STEEP DROP in orders, a fall in home and export sales, plunging confidence
and pessimism about prospects are highlighted in the latest Business Survey
North of businesses in Cumbria and north-east England, published yesterday.
The survey, a stark contrast to previous upbeat predictions that northern
England might lead the country out of recession, says the northern economy
took a pounding in the third quarter.
Main indicators such as sales, orders, investment and employment suggest
that the survey's findings, based on responses from 788 northern-region
companies, are more than just a 'kneejerk reaction to the events of Black
Wednesday', says the report.
It was produced by Northern Development Company (NDC) and the Tyne and Wear
and Teesside chambers of commerce.
'Worsening results combined with growing uncertainty could have extremely
damaging consequences for the northern economy,' it warns.
The NDC and the chambers, concerned at the survey's findings when the region
faces the loss of more jobs in the mining, offshore, marine and defence
sectors, wrote yesterday to Mr Tim Sainsbury, industry minister, calling for
more government aid to create new employment.
The survey shows that only 15.9 per cent of companies were working at more
than 90 per cent capacity, down from 21.5 per cent in the second quarter.
Investment in plant and machinery and buildings declined and training
expenditure was cut sharply.
Nearly two fifths (38.1 per cent) of companies expected business conditions
to deteriorate over the next three months; just 12.8 per cent anticipated an
improvement. In the second quarter, 33.5 per cent expected an improvement
and 9 per cent forecast a decline. Manufacturers and service companies were
equally pessimistic about prospects.
The report predicts further fourth-quarter deterioration in employment. The
modest post-election improvement was 'another false dawn', it says.

BRITISH women working in banking and finance earn 53 per cent of men's
earnings in the same sector in an average month, according to figures from

women receive in eight other European Community countries, Catherine Milton
writes.
The figures also put Britain second from bottom in a league of 11 countries
for average female manual industrial earnings as a proportion of men's
earnings per hour. Only Luxembourg is lower.
The figure for industry is the more accurate because a comparison of average
monthly earnings tends to widen the difference between men's and women's
earnings because women work shorter hours.
Earnings' comparisons are hampered by the lack of data for certain
countries.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Halifax cuts home loan rate to 9.29%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HALIFAX Building Society, the largest UK mortgage lender, yesterday cut its
standard mortgage interest rate from 9.99 per cent to 9.29 per cent in the
wake of Friday's fall of 1 percentage point in base rates.
Halifax's new rate is slightly above the 9.25 per cent rate set on Friday by
Abbey National and National &amp; Provincial Building Society.
Halifax has cut rates on larger loans to 8.79 per cent for loans between
Pounds 60,000 and Pounds 100,000 up to 75 per cent of value (old rate 9.49
per cent) and to 8.54 per cent on loans over Pounds 100,000 (old rate 9.25
per cent).
Loans between 75 per cent and 90 per cent of the value of a property have
been cut to 8.99 per cent for mortgages between Pounds 60,000 and Pounds
100,000 (old rate 9.69 per cent) and 8.79 per cent for mortgages over Pounds
100,000 (old rate 9.49 per cent).
An average endowment mortgage of Pounds 60,000 will be Pounds 30.63 a month
cheaper, said Halifax. First-time buyers will be able to obtain a mortgage
at a discount rate of 6.9 per cent - the lowest mortgage level from the
society since 1965.
The change in rates will apply immediately for new borrowers and for
existing customers from December 1, although Halifax is going ahead with an
earlier planned cut in its standard rate from 10.65 per cent to 9.99 per
cent on November 1.

FT  20 OCT 92 / New consortium may bid for ITN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THAMES TELEVISION is con-sidering promoting an alternative consortium to bid
for, or refinance, Independent Television News.
The news was given to ITN shareholders before yesterday's board meeting, the
first to consider the offer for the news organisation made last week by a
consortium of four companies including Carlton Communications.
The ITN board meeting yesterday agreed a five-year deal to supply a news
service to ITV at an average of Pounds 53m a year. The agreement now has to
be ratified by the ITV companies.
The board also agreed to set up a sub-committee to investigate further the
approach by the consortium and alternative proposals. A further board
meeting will be held on Thursday October 29.
Last week Carlton, Central, London Weekend and Reuters promised to buy the
400,000 ITN shares for Pounds 1 each and inject up to Pounds 30m to cover a
property deficit on ITN's London headquarters.
Ratification of the five-year news supply agreement was set as a condition
of the deal.
The letter from Thames, the largest ITN shareholder, said that the ITV
companies which at present own ITN should be aware that Thames 'is
considering promoting an alternative or revised proposal for the future
ownership and/or refinancing of ITN'.
The letter - which was signed by Ms Linda Coe, company secretary - did not
go into any specifics or give any numbers.
Mr Richard Dunn, chief executive of Thames, is the chairman of ITN.
The Carlton offer, being organised by Hambros Bank, expires on November 4.

The figure for industry is the more accurate because a comparison of average

The research found that more women in the UK worked part-time than
elsewhere. In 1990 there were nearly 15m women part-timers in the EC - 5m of
whom were in the UK.
The commission argues that the tendency for part-time jobs to be low paid is
an important factor in the gap between men's and women's earnings in the UK.
Other factors include fragmented collective bargaining structures and the
lack of a minimum wage.
The research supports indications that while a higher percentage of women
work in the UK, the gap between the earnings of men and women is among the
widest in Europe.
Earnings' comparisons are hampered by the lack of data for certain
countries.
Both comparison groups contained France, Germany and Denmark.

of the 33-year-old vehicle. Film critics of the time suggested that the
Minis, which performed antics that included jumping between rooftops,
upstaged Michael Caine and Noel Coward. The versions about to go on sale
look like the Mini Coopers used in the film but have standard 1.3 litre
engines. Production of the Pounds 5,995 cars will be limited to 1,000 for
the UK and 750 for Italy. Meanwhile, the Cabrio, an upmarket convertible
version of the Mini, will go on sale early next year at the same time as a
convertible Metro.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Europe debate 'soon' say Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEBATE paving the way for the return of the Maastricht Bill to the
Commons will be 'very soon', ministers indicated yesterday, Alison Smith
writes. It will therefore be possible to bring the bill back before MPs in
the middle of next month.
Discussion of the Maastricht treaty at last week's cabinet meeting came down
on balance in favour of pressing ahead with the legislation.
The Foreign Office is keen to proceed on the basis that continued delay is
debilitating and encourages the Tory rebels.
In his statement to the Commons today on the Birmingham European Community
summit, Mr John Major, the prime minister, will re-state his determination
to take the legislation through parliament.
Government business managers will not commit themselves firmly to any
particular timetable until they see how the paving debate goes.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Landlords 'abusing duties'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD abuse by landlords of their legal responsibilities towards owners
of leasehold flats has been uncovered by a survey of such owners.
The study, commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, the social
research body, is the first to look in detail at problems faced by owners in
small converted blocks of flats. It found that two out of three leaseholders
in its sample of 246 had suffered problems with landlords failing to meet
obligations.
Almost half of the leaseholders complained of serious problems such as
excessive service charges and delays over important repairs.
The most common complaints were about repairs and difficulties in contacting
the landlord followed by suspected misuse of funds collected by landlords.
Twenty-five per cent of leaseholders said they had considered taking
landlords to court and 5 per cent had done so. Six per cent claimed they
were the victims of harassment.
Ten per cent of flat-owners did not know who held the freehold of their
building, with more than 50 per cent dealing with an agent. A further 28 per
cent reported difficulties with making contact with landlords or agents.
Only 6 per cent had a resident landlord.
The survey was carried out in anticipation of the leasehold reforms in the
Housing and Urban Development Bill which will come before parliament this
autumn. The legislation will give most holders of long leases a right to buy
the freehold of their flats.
Plans to introduce a system of 'commonhold' - which would enable flats to be
bought and sold as freehold properties, but with special legal obligations
towards other owners in the same building - have been postponed. The survey
showed that dwindling leases produced few problems buying or selling
leaseholds, and that very few tenants had sought lease extensions. However,
of those surveyed, only 3 per cent of leases had less than 60 years
remaining.
One in seven leaseholders already owned a share of the freehold and most
said the arrangement worked well, giving them greater control over the
upkeep of buildings.

FT  20 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure increases on ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was no let-up for ICI as the shares fell a further 24 to 1003p,
weighed down by a large line of stock said to be overhanging the market. The
latest slide comes in the wake of sharp profit forecast cuts last week.
Traders said one securities house had taken on a block of around 2.5m shares
at 995p and was unable to place the majority - although closing turnover of
4.2m suggested some had been offloaded. It is believed that US investment
house Goldman Sachs had bought the shares from one institution.
The house tends to be linked with any large ICI dealings because it had the
misfortune of taking on Hanson's 2.8 per cent stake in ICI at 1,400p earlier
this year and is believed to have some of those 20m shares still on its
books.
Powers volatile
Electricity generators were volatile opening with worries over the impact of
the coal dispute and closing firmly with the climbdown by the government.
At the opening of trading, nervousness had been prompted by suggestions that
the government's minority stakes in the generating companies could be used
to fund additional payments for the miners. With no shortage of stock
around, traders suggested such a move would undermine the shares.
That speculation was ended by the government's afternoon decision to
postpone mining closures, providing a boost to the generators' shares in
busy, late trading. PowerGen, which opened at 261, fell 10 by mid-day, but
rallied to close steady. National Power tumbled to 241 at one stage before
recovering to 254p, a net gain of 3 on the day.
Nervousness among generators prompted some brokers to reiterate their
support for the Recs (regional electricity companies), among which, Eastern
put on 7 to 387p, Manweb 7 to 456p and South West 10 to 431p.
Steel active
British Steel stood out as the day's most actively traded stock after
turnover soared to more than 40m shares following a placing by James Capel.
The shares eased  1/2 p to 60p.
The agency broker was reported to have bought a block of around 17m shares
just before lunchtime. But with James Capel refusing to make any comment on
the deal, the seller remained a mystery, although the timing of the deal led
to speculation about a US seller. The broker managed to place the stock
during the afternoon at 60p, although initially with some difficulty,
according to one analyst.
Further selling from UK and other international holders of British Steel
yesterday helped boost the day's hefty turnover. With the continued weakness
in European steel prices, many UK investors remain sellers of the stock.
S. G. Warburg was reported to have turned seller of the stock, having only
just switched to a buy recommendation last week.
Oil major BP saw a much-needed bounce on a recommendation from County
NatWest, which was advising clients to switch out of Shell Transport. After
speaking to the company County feels BP's cost-cutting and disposals
programme is pointing to a faster debt reduction than most analysts had
predicted.
Meanwhile, County argues that sterling's weakness has pushed Shell up to a
price/earnings ratio of more than 18 times, a level that cannot be justified
by the oil group's recovery potential. BP lifted 7 1/2 to 230p on turnover
of 7.2m shares and Shell, still benefiting from currency problems, rose 7 to
539p.
Exploration group Enterprise firmed 2 to 410p after announcing that the US
Securities and Exchange Commission had declared effective its previously
announced offering of 6.75m American depositary shares at Dollars 20 each.
The offering, which should be completed by October 23, was underwritten by a
syndicate led by Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch and Warburg Securities, the
company said.
Reuters Holdings was one of the few dollar-influenced stocks that failed to
benefit from the growing strength in the US currency. Investors are still
worried that the stock is overvalued despite recent falls. Also, there is
some concern ahead of an international conference call on Thursday. The
shares drifted 7 to 1,227p.
Elsewhere in international stocks, Glaxo was off 7 at 779p with hints of
good news on a rival product.
SmithKline Beecham is to announce third-quarter figures today and there were
suggestions that the results would contain good news on SmithKline's
anti-emetic drug Kytril. That would impact on Glaxo's Zofran. SmithKline 'A'
shares rose 4 to 512p.
Wellcome improved 12 to 961p on dollar considerations following recent
upgrades. BAT Industries gained 14 to 852p.
More analysts moved in on Barclays and the shares, which had tumbled at the
end of last week, slipped a further 16 to 301p.
Agency broker James Capel was said to have produced the most gloomy estimate
of forthcoming profits, shifting to a Pounds 150m loss for 1992 from a
previous estimate of Pounds 300m profits. Meanwhile, HSBC remained strong
and improved 16 to 475p. The far eastern bank is always a beneficiary of a
stronger dollar as the Hong Kong currency is directly linked to the US
currency.
The beginning of a series of institutional presentations from Guinness
brought little cheer to the drinks group, the shares retreating 10 to 517p.
Scottish and Newcastle recovered from recent price war worries to add 6 to
396p. Bass continued under a cloud, the shares slipping 8 to 510p.
A quiet food manufacturers' sector was enlivened by buyers in Unilever, up
12 at 1065p, and Tate and Lyle, ahead 5 at 347p.
In telephone networks, Vodafone, responding to its recent 'Low-Call' sales
push, added 2 to 341p. Cable and Wireless jumped 9 to 598p, the strong
dollar attracting investors as well as a recommendation from Hoare Govett
that the group would be a major beneficiary from the improving political and
economic situation in China.
First day's trading in Vardon saw the leisure attractions group close at a
2p premium above the 45p placement price, although thin trading volume was
reported.
Low-level hints that Forte was discussing the sale of its Gardner Merchant
subsidiary to the catering group's management failed to hit a chord in the
market, although the shares later rallied to close 4 ahead at 152p.
Negative comment continued to eat into Rank Organisation, the shares off 6
at 508p.
Courtaulds Textiles lifted 13 to 464p following a successful visit to the
company by analysts last week and talk that a large buyer was in the
background. However, volume was slim.
British Airways fell 4 to 294p, on reports of a UBS Phillips &amp; Drew profits
downgrading. The securities house was said to have trimmed the current year
figure by Pounds 30m to Pounds 370m.
Conglomerate Williams Holdings, eased 2 to 257p, after the company's broker
S. G. Warburg was reported to have trimmed forecasts.
Among aerospace stocks, British Aerospace was hit early by press reports
that the Pounds 40bn oil-for-arms Al-Yamamah defence contract on which it is
the lead contractor, would not proceed. They ended 6 lower at 132p, on
turnover of 4.8m.

FT  20 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Policy shift encourages market rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIFTH anniversary of the great crash of 1987 saw London's equity market
weather the expected political storm over pit closures and end a session of
low volumes and high tension only marginally easier on balance as Mr Michael
Heseltine modified his programme of mine shutdowns.
But it was hard going throughout the day as worries about a possible
government defeat over the mining industry in the House of Commons on
Wednesday caused extreme concern in the foreign exchange and stock markets.
The Footsie 100 Index, under substantial pressure early in the day,
eventually ended only 1.7 lower at 2,562.2. The FT-SE Mid 250 index lost 5.6
at 2,380.3 and the FT-SE 350 1.2 to 1,230.1.
Dealers were in sombre mood as they manned their trading desk terminals at
the outset of trading.
The government was given a frightful pasting in the weekend press and
dealers braced themselves for an onslaught against sterling in the forex
markets.
Sterling duly came under heavy pressure at the outset, sliding some four
pfennigs against the D-Mark and three cents against the dollar. The reaction
of the stock market was for marketmakers to chop their opening prices
sharply, with the Footsie retreating more than 21 points within an hour of
the start of trading.
Very little in the way of institutional selling pressure was forthcoming,
however, and share prices embarked on a slow but steady rally as the market
picked up hints that an emergency meeting of the UK Cabinet would result in
a change of policy regarding the pit closures being announced in the
afternoon.
The rally saw the Footsie-100 pick up to show a fall of only 6.7 in
mid-morning before dipping off again in the early afternoon. A determined
recovery then set in and the Footsie, down more than 17 points over
lunchtime, began to respond to a strong opening by Wall Street, which was
followed up by the government's change of heart over the minefields.
At its best the Footsie was within a point of last Friday's close,
eventually closing only marginally easier on balance.
Turnover in equities yesterday, amounting to 412.9m shares, was said by one
leading marketmaker to have been 'particularly disappointing'. Customer
business in recent sessions has been well below levels needed to provide
overall profits for the London market. Retail business last Friday was
Pounds 1.26bn, as the market responded to the 1 per cent cut in base rates.
British Steel was the heaviest traded stock in the Footsie-100 as James
Capel, the agency broker, sold a big block of stock into the market, while
Barclays continued to suffer as other broking firms followed Credit Lyonnais
Laing and began to factor in big losses from property and bad debts which
may lead to Barclays cutting its dividend.
Some observers view current market uncertainty as a good opportunity. The
strategy team at Goldman Sachs, acknowledging 'the clear downside risk' said
2,400 is likely to represent the limit of any downside move and emphasised
their medium-term optimism for UK equities: 'We expect the market to be
substantially higher in about a year.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE derivatives reported a dull session with little in the way of strong
market features on which to focus, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the FT-SE futures contract for December delivery was
struck at 2,590 which was viewed as a strong opening. But this initial
strength quickly faded as the early weakness in sterling led to nervousness
in the futures which sent December into retreat falling to 2,567 by 9am.
The rally in sterling also led to a similar move in the futures, sending
December moving gently forward. A flurry of activity was seen around
lunchtime when a leading house went shopping for 400 contracts which
appeared to put a floor under December. A squeeze as dealers covered short
positions during the afternoon caused another sharp move upwards to the
day's high point of 2,609.
Profit-taking just ahead of the official close saw December finish the
session at 2,595, down 12 on Friday's close and around 9 points above its
estimated fair value premium to cash which fell to around 23 points in this
account. Turnover at 6,772 was uninspiring.
There was little excitement in the traded options either and total volume
was a poor 24,574 contracts, of which the FT-SE 100 option accounted for
7,305 lots and the Euro-FT-SE option 4,130 contracts. Asda was the busiest
stock option with a day's total of 1,547 contracts.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (7): High hopes for new
plant / Profile of BMW
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'TO be successful in the world, a company has to be successful in the United
States,' said Mr Eberhard von Kuenheim, chairman of BMW, as he broke ground
for the company's new Dollars 400m plant in South Carolina on September 30.
The German company, which searched the world for three years before deciding
finally on the Spartanburg-Greenville area of South Carolina, says it
concluded that to be competitive it had to have its own production facility
within the US, the largest vehicle market in the world.
But the choice of South Carolina took some by surprise. The state is not
known for car production and in the minds of many it remains backward, with
some of the lowest educational rankings in the nation.
But the Spartanburg-Greenville area in the foothills of the Blue Ridge
Mountains scores the highest per capita level of foreign investment in the
US. Some 165 foreign companies from 17 nations are located there, according
to the Greenville Chamber of Commerce. Of these, 58 are German - a factor
that no doubt gave some extra comfort to BMW.
The German luxury car maker was lured by many of the same enticements as
other international companies: relatively low wages in a union-free
environment, a first-rate state-operated training programme for workers, tax
breaks, good transportation and a strongly pro-business climate.
In BMW's case, the incentives package totals about Dollars 150m, not
including the innovative programme that will custom train workers to BMW's
specifications. The package includes:
Acquisition for Dollars 37m of 900 acres of land for the site by the South
Carolina Ports Authority. BMW will lease the site for Dollars 1 a year;
State and local government commitment of some Dollars 23m in site
preparation and infrastructure improvements such as water, sewerage and
roads;
State backing for a Dollars 45m expansion of the Spartanburg-Greenville
airport, although most of this expense will be covered by the federal
government;
State and local tax breaks worth Dollars 71m over the next 20 years.
The price seems relatively small, from South Carolina's point of view. For
BMW will invest some Dollars 400m in a 1.9m sq ft production facility and
create some 2,000 jobs. And, it hints to local officials, if the market goes
its way, that investment - and the number of jobs - could double by the end
of the decade.
Some 21 manufacturers of vehicle parts and components are also expected to
locate near the plant to supply BMW when its starts production in 1995. The
state expects these to bring another Dollars 262m in investment and create
at least as many jobs as BMW.
Just in terms of payrolls, South Carolina estimates the direct and indirect
economic impact of BMW's plant and its suppliers will be Dollars 6.4bn over
the next 20 years.
According to South Carolina Governor Carroll Campbell: 'Our investment will
be returned to state and local governments in less than five years.'
For BMW the relocation is also a good deal. It estimates that production
costs in South Carolina will be roughly one third less than those of
Germany. The key factor for such reduced costs will be low hourly wages for
South Carolina's workers. When the plant opens in 1995, wages are estimated
to run to about Dollars 10 to Dollars 15 an hour compared with Dollars 28 in
Germany.
The United Auto Workers union, which retains its grip on US vehicle
production, is vowing to organise the plant. UAW wages average about Dollars
16 per hour. But the union's battle will be uphill in this traditionally
anti-union state. The Spartanburg-Greenville area is one of the least
unionised areas of the US and local business leaders say they intend to keep
it that way.
Moreover, resistance from the company can be expected. Mr Helmut Panke, BMW
chief of planning, said: 'We don't think we need an intermediary between our
employees and management.'
The company will produce a new model - the details of which it declines to
reveal - in South Carolina for the US and export markets. One thing is known
about the new model; its price tag will be less than the Dollars 30,000 US
luxury tax mark.
BMW's hopes for the new US plant are high. It wants the plant to help it
regain the level of sales - nearly 100,000 units a year - that it enjoyed
during its heyday in the US market in the mid-1980s.
And, although US consumers have been emphasising value rather than luxury
since the start of this decade, BMW's 27 per cent increase in American sales
from January through August this year is spurring company dreams of glory
days to come.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (8): Conglomeration of
economies - US Regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALIFORNIA is suffering its most severe recession since the Second World
War. Yet the state of Washington remains relatively buoyant. And in New
England, which has been struggling with recession for four years, there are
the first, faint, glimmerings of recovery.
The US is not so much a single economy as a conglomeration of regional
economies, each with its distinctive cycle of growth and recession; each
with its comparative advantages and disadvantages. A business planning to
locate in North America cannot afford to ignore these differences - or
forecasts of relative long-term growth and population movement.
The recession of 1990-91, from which the US is emerging with painful
slowness, hit the west and east coasts of the country far harder than the
middle.
New England was the first region to slide, as the so-called 'Massachusetts
Miracle' - of above national average growth - came to an end. The region's
important defence industries suffered from Pentagon budget cuts, its large
computer companies floundered, over-optimistic speculative building left a
huge property overhang, and one of the largest regional banks was left
insolvent.
However, the economy now appears to have stabilised, with further cuts in
defence-related jobs offset by pick-ups in other areas such as health care.
But while house-building is picking up, economists suggest any sustained
recovery will be extremely slow. Over the long term, this crowded region,
with relatively high property prices, will face a fight for jobs with the
fast-growing and cheaper Sunbelt region of the south.
But the term Yankee ingenuity originated in New England and the region's
comparative advantages include a highly educated workforce, a concentration
of fine universities, and a complex of high technology businesses.
New York and the Middle Atlantic region, just down the coast from New
England, have also been hit hard by the recession. Wall Street, critical to
the health of New York City, has enjoyed booming securities markets over the
past year but this has not translated into jobs. Securities firms have been
busily paring the fat they built up in the 1980s and commercial banks are in
the throes of a big consolidation wave.
New York needs to get its high labour and property costs more in line with
the rest of the country if it is to prosper long term.
It will remain the world's leading financial centre for many years, if not
indefinitely, and its position as the most cosmopolitan of America cities
will continue to attract international businesses.
The south-east, which ranges from Virginia through to Florida, has been
harder hit by the recession than any region other than the north-east,
although it was one of the fastest growing regions of the country in the
1980s as companies and population moved south to take advantage of its low
costs and pleasant climate.
The region is expected to grow somewhat faster than the national average as
the US emerges from recession. Florida will be helped by Miami's
increasingly important role as a Latin American trading centre.
Atlanta, Georgia, currently the most popular city in the US for corporate
and government relocations, is also expected see good growth, helped by its
high technology and service industries and its capture of the 1996 Olympic
Games.
The mid-western Great Lakes region, centred on Chicago, has suffered only
the mildest of recessions, thanks to a property market which never became
too overheated in the 1980s and the restructuring during that decade of its
heavy 'rust-belt' industries.
It is expected to perform well as the nation moves out of recession and
demand picks up for its consumer durable goods and capital equipment.
The west-central and mountain states regions, including such states as South
Dakota, Wyoming, Utah and Colorado, have been the strongest performers in
the US over the past two years.
The mountain states have grown at about 2 per cent a year, albeit from a
very small economic base compared to other regions of the country.
But it is the region's very lack of development which is now spurring
growth.
Businesses are attracted by its low costs and taxes and a positive work
ethic in areas such as Utah, with its large Mormon population.
Employees are attracted by the region's wide, open spaces and dazzling
mountain scenery.
Some economists are forecasting an acceleration of growth to 4 per cent as
the nation comes out of recession.
The mountain states have been a prime beneficiary of problems in California,
where high taxes and property and labour costs, coupled with very
restrictive environmental regulations, have been encouraging companies to
relocate elsewhere.
The north-western region, centred on Seattle, has also benefited
economically from the Californian malaise, as large numbers of Californians
have migrated north, attracted by lower living costs and the area's scenic
beauty.
The north-west, which has enjoyed above-average growth in recent years,
could suffer badly if Boeing, the aircraft company headquartered in Seattle,
is hit by a prolonged recession in the airline industry.
Over the long-term, however, the region stands to benefit strongly from
Boeing's presence, a growing high technology sector and important trading
links with Japan and other Asian countries.
Despite California's problems, the state remains a mecca for Americans
migrating from other states, and Mexicans heading north, although the flow
has diminished from the dramatic population expansion witnessed in the
1980s.
California has been hit much harder by recession than most economists
forecast, with job losses in its important defence industries, financial
services and the construction industry. To this have been added a string of
earthquakes, forest fires and the destruction caused by this year's Los
Angeles riots.
The Business Forecasting Project at the University of California, Los
Angeles, which has tended to be more pessimistic than rival analysts, now
suggests recovery may not happen until the final months of next year.
Texas, which suffered a severe recession in the mid-1980s thanks to a wild
construction spree and falling oil prices, has since bounced back and grew
about 1.5 per cent last year, thanks to an industrial diversification which
makes it far less dependent on the energy sector.
The region has become an important high-technology centre and stands to
benefit more than almost any other from the increased cross-border business
which will follow the establishment of a North American Free Trade Area.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Legal actions to go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL CHALLENGES to the pit closure programme brought by the miners' unions
will go ahead today despite the government's substantial climbdown.
The concessions announced yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine were widely seen
as going some way towards meeting the unions' central complaint about the
lack of consultation.
However, the unions' lawyers maintain that enough issues - particularly
surrounding the exact nature of the consultation being proposed - remain
undecided.
Mr Mark Stephens, for the National Union of Mineworkers, said it appeared
that the consultation was going to take place only as a matter of form,
rather than in any meaningful or open-minded way.
The action to be heard today is that brought by the NUM and Nacods, the pit
deputies' union. This is a two-pronged challenge which alleges a breach of
UK law and of European law over the miners' contracts.
The unions are also challenging British Coal's failure to go through the
modified colliery review procedure before implementing the closure
programme. They argue that the workforce has a legitimate expectation of
being consulted in such circumstances.
The second action - a judicial review won by the Union of Democratic
Mineworkers - will start on Thursday after the judgment has been made on the
NUM-Nacods case.
The UDM case also centres on the alleged lack of consultation by British
Coal.
However, unlike the NUM-Nacods action, which is based on private contract
law, the UDM action is based on public law in seeking to show that British
Coal has failed in a statutory duty to consult as established by the Coal
Industry Nationalisation Act.
The outcome of the pits dispute will ultimately depend on political rather
than legal factors and Mr Heseltine's shift in position has further reduced
the significance of this week's legal battles.
Nevertheless, the courts' decisions will prove vital ammunition to the
winning side, whichever win.
Even if the government loses in the courts, that could make a further
political climbdown easier to explain.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Eggar to discuss security of pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM EGGAR, the energy minister, has agreed to meet trustees of British
Coal's pension scheme to discuss safeguarding assets under privatisation.
In a letter to trustees of the British Coal Staff Superannuation Scheme late
last week, Mr Eggar said he would meet trustees at the earliest convenient
time. Trustees of both the Staff Scheme, representing 106,000 white collar
and pit supervisory pensioners and staff, and the Mineworkers' Scheme,
representing 589,487 miners, had sought guarantees to protect benefits if
parts of British Coal are sold.
In spite of big surpluses in both schemes and steep improvements in benefits
in recent years, 90,000 former mineworkers - about a third of all pensioners
 -receive pensions of less than Pounds 10 per week. Those employed before
1975 were entitled to flat-rate pensions rather than a pension linked to
final salary.
Over the past two years, trustees of both schemes have amended the trust
deeds to make it more difficult for a future private-sector owner of British
Coal to use pension-fund assets or to reduce benefits to members. The
Mineworkers' Scheme trust deed now says that if the scheme is wound up any
surplus must be used solely to improve benefits and that the trustees must
approve any new owner of the scheme. The staff scheme requires any new plan
sponsor to offer benefits equal to those offered by British Coal.
However, under trust law, those clauses may be difficult to enforce without
government backing and trustees are anxious to see that they are honored.
The combined assets of the two schemes, about Pounds 12bn, are more than
enough to meet projected liabilities. As a result, British Coal is enjoying
a contributions holiday from both schemes ending in 1995 for the staff
scheme and in 2000 for the miners' scheme. In the event of privatisation,
the contributions holiday would be enjoyed by a new employer.
The contributions holidays represent only 30 per cent of the value of the
scheme surpluses. The remaining 70 per cent has been used to improve
benefits by lowering the retirement age to 60, doubling death benefits and
by sharply increasing payments to the oldest pensioners.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Notts Tec calls for national energy policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST five months ago North Nottinghamshire Training and Enterprise Council
warned that continued pit closures would have a 'devastating' effect on the
economic and social life of the county.
In the first political intervention by a Tec, the council called for a
national energy policy based on the use of coal as a strategic fuel.
Mrs Pat Richards, chief executive, said: 'Everything we do on the training
and enterprise front can be negated by a rapid reduction of the (coal)
industry.' Yesterday, Mrs Richards and representatives of 16 other Tecs
affected by the threatened pit closures met Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
employment secretary, to discuss what Tecs can do to help miners made
redundant.
Mrs Shephard has written to Mr Greville Janner, Labour chairman of the
Commons employment committee, saying that Pounds 75m will be made available
to Tecs. She wants the Tecs worst affected by the closures to present plans
within two weeks for tackling the problem alongside the Employment Service.
The ES and Tecs will get an extra Pounds 30m this year and Pounds 45m next
year. This year's money will be additional to Tecs' Pounds 2.4bn training
budget, but it is not yet known whether the Pounds 30m will be additional to
next year's settlement.
Tec representatives said after the meeting with Mrs Shephard that they were
appreciative of her efforts to get extra funds. They were, however, critical
of government policy.
Mr Michael Malone, deputy chairman of MetroTec near Wigan, said: 'No amount
of money compensates for the fact that we are losing jobs and we just cannot
create new ones.'
Tecs at present are struggling to deal with existing rises in unemployment,
including the high-est level of long-term unemployment - people unemployed
for more than a year - since July 1988.
Before the mining closures were announced Tec leaders told the government
that they considered any cuts to their budgets in the next public
expenditure survey would be unacceptable.
Many Tecs have pointed out that cuts to their budgets have led to falls in
the quality of their programmes, particularly Employment Training - the
scheme for the adult long-term unemployed.
Tecs feared that the government might cut their existing programmes or claw
back any underspending on Employment Action, the work experience scheme, to
pay for extra help for miners. The belief that the Pounds 75m over two years
will most probably be new money has been welcomed by Tecs.
Mr John Troth, chairman of North East Wales Tec, said in a letter to the
prime minister at the weekend: 'Tecs were set up precisely to deal with this
sort of situation and it required the government to recognise the need for
local flexibility and the relevant investment to enable us to provide the
individually focused support that the miners will need to get into jobs.'
He added: 'We are not talking about throwing money at the problem as has
happened with previous large-scale redundancy programmes. We are calling for
focused investment in local, effective solutions.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Unlikely choice aims to co-ordinate help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS energy secretary during the bitter 1984-85 strike in which the government
avenged the earlier defeat of the Heath administration by the miners, Lord
Walker might not seem an obvious choice as the national figure intended to
co-ordinate measures to help the coalfield communities.
His appointment rests not on that experience, but on his record as Welsh
secretary from 1987 until 1990, when he turned what he had been expected to
regard as a dead-end job into a high-profile, one-man inward investment
agency.
Though the announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, was greeted with sustained laughter from opposition MPs, Lord
Walker's long career in business and in politics - he was a millionaire by
the time he was 30 and served as an MP for more than 30 years - is a sign of
his acumen and ability as an operator.
His business activities also mean that he will not be troubled by the
confusion over whether his new post is paid.
At the start of the year Lord Walker's business interests listed in the
Commons register included non-executive directorships at Smith New Court,
the investment house, and British Gas, the privatised utility. He was
brought into Smith New Court by Sir Michael Richardson, the chairman who is
also vice-chairman of NM Rothschild, the government's main adviser on
privatisation of British Coal.
His reaction yesterday was to emphasise his aim of creating co-operation
between all agencies involved in helping mining communities.
'I want to try to do an analysis of the priorities and what tasks are needed
to get new commercial and economic activities in the localities,' he said.
'I think there is a need to try to get a good team spirit going between
local authorities, government, industry and trade unions.'
Even before Lord Walker stood down from his Worcester constituency at the
April general election, Mr Heseltine had called on his skills when, as
environment secretary, he announced that Lord Walker would lead the planned
urban regeneration agency.
Wrangles about the remit and the amount of money for the agency (both the
scope of the job and the amount of funds available are diminishing) have
since soured Lord Walker's relationship with the Department of the
Environment, but he remains close to Mr Heseltine, who was once one of his
junior ministers.
The two share a longstanding belief that governments should work in
partnership with industry - a philosophy that Lord Walker was pursuing as
trade and industry secretary 20 years ago - and served together in the then
Mrs Margaret Thatcher's cabinet for more than five years.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Details of review start to emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE furore surrounding the government's climbdown over the pit closures
yesterday, details were last night starting to emerge of how the two-pronged
review of mines would be carried out.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, announced that he would
re-introduce the statutory 90-day review period before redundancy notices
were issued to miners from the 10 pits still scheduled to close, in
accordance with the 1975 Employment Protection Act. This requirement had
been suspended last week.
The review gives the collieries and mining unions 90 days to make pit-by-pit
cases. At the end of the period the cases will be reviewed by British Coal.
While it would be theoretically possible for a pit to persuade British Coal
it should remain open, the corporation said 'it would be wrong to raise any
hope that the outcome of these consultations will be that any of these 10
pits continue working'.
For the remaining 21 pits, the threat of closure has been lifted for a
'moratorium' period.
Mr Heseltine said British Coal and the government would use this time to set
out the case for closures, to conduct a further review of energy policy and
the coal industry, and to 'consult widely'.
It was unclear last night whether the consultations would include only the
mining unions, British Coal and the government, or whether they would extend
to power generators, regulators and other industries.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Pit enterprise zones may be delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE'S pledge to set up enterprise zones to help stimulate
new economic activity in areas hit by pit closures is unlikely to be
fulfilled quickly. He may also face a struggle to win approval for his plans
from Brussels.
The record suggests that when economic catastrophe overtakes a community it
takes an average of between eight and 10 months for the proposed enterprise
zone to start operating.
When it does start the zone provides investors with a package of measures
which supporters claim can play an important role in economic regeneration.
Critics say that enterprise zones merely transfer jobs and investment away
from other areas. The European Commission is highly sceptical of an
initiative which it believes can distort competition. The zones have been
seen, particularly by the Treasury, as a comparatively expensive way of
generating jobs.
Zone status brings with it a package of incentives to attract inward
investors. They include the absence of business rates for the life of the
zone - usually 10 years - 100 per cent capital allowances and greatly
simplified planning procedures.
Mr Heseltine's promise to establish zones wherever they are most effective
does not mean that every affected mining area will benefit.
The initiative will be led by the Department of the Environment, which will
appoint consultants to examine potential zones and talk to the local
authorities and landowners involved. When proposals have been drawn up and
agreed between the Environment Department and the Department of Trade and
Industry, they will be submitted to Brussels for approval. It seems unlikely
that any will be operating before next summer.
Enterprise zones were started in the early 1980s. One of the most successful
experiments was based on Corby, Northants, which was devastated by the
closure of the British Steel plant.
Others followed in places such as Delyn, following the closure of the
Shotton steel works at Clwyd, north Wales, and at Sunderland, after the
shipyard closure led to a protracted battle to win zone approval from
Brussels.
Earlier this year the government applied to the Commission to establish a
zone in north Lanarkshire to offset the impact of the closure of the
Ravenscraig steelworks. It is still waiting for the go-ahead.
There are currently 20 enterprise zones. The government said in 1989 that it
did not plan to create any more.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced a Pounds 10m industrial aid package for
Wales which it said would lead to the creation of more than 1,300 jobs and
safeguard a further 500.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said 17 projectswere to be assisted. The
biggest project is the Pounds 30m Tesco dry-goods distribution depot outside
Newport, Gwent, which will create up to 500 jobs. Tesco is to use the depot
to serve an area from the west Midlands to south-west England.
Mr Hunt said government support for Welsh industry in the current financial
year had reached Pounds 40m before the latest Pounds 10m. This would create
or help safeguard 7,200 jobs.
Also receiving help is the Pounds 5m meat-processing project of McIntosh
Reynolds and John Rhind Farms, of Scotland. The two are developing and
expanding the former United Meat Packers (Wales) abattoir on Anglesey,
creating 230 jobs.
Development of abattoirs in Wales is essential as most do not meet new
European Community hygiene regulations.
Most of the other schemes being backed are small and cover companies
involved in a range of areas, from motor parts to shellfish and
environmental engineering.

The mine is one of 10 Mr Heseltine has targeted for immediate closure.
The pit's deputy manager, Mr Peter Hewes, said he was seeking clarification
from British Coal on Silverhill's position.
Mr Roy Lynk, president of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, who has spent
four days and nights 1,200ft underground at Silverhill, was last night

Mr Lynk said of Mr Heseltine's statement yesterday: 'He is just trying to

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR MPs accused the government in the Commons last night of postponing
instead of abandoning the proposals for the closure of 31 pits, and stepped
up their demands for an independent inquiry to establish the facts about the
collieries' viability.
Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary, called on dissident Tory
MPs to recognise the limited nature of the concession offered by Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and to back a Labour motion
advocating an independent inquiry in the vote tomorrow night.
The motion demands that no closures take place 'until the select committee
on trade and industry concludes a review of the costs and benefits of
closing the pits and the comparative costs and benefits to the nation of
retaining them in production'.
To a roar of approval from the Labour benches, Mr Cook challenged Mr
Heseltine to demonstrate his confidence in the case for proceeding with the
closure proposals by submitting them to independent judgment.
Labour fears that most of the 31 pits still face closure were heightened
when Mr Heseltine, subjected to a sustained assault from the opposition
benches, indicated that any change of policy was likely to be 'at the
margin'.
Mr Mark Fisher, Labour MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central, stressed that Mr
Heseltine had announced not a new policy, but 'slow death by delay'.
Resisting the demands for an independent inquiry, the trade and industry
secretary argued that it would be unable to produce an agreement because the
different 'vested interests' in the energy industry would hold to their
stated positions.
A warning by Harrow East Conservative MP Mr Hugh Dykes that without the
promise of a more fundamental review of policy the government was likely to
be defeated in tomorrow's vote appeared to make little impact on Mr
Heseltine.
Limiting his expressions of regret over the political storm, he questioned
whether his Tory backbench critics really wanted to see public expenditure
increased to keep open 'uneconomic pits against the advice of those who
manage those pits'.
He emphasised that any extra spending resulting from prolonging the life of
un-economic pits would have to be 'matched against a whole range of other
investment or revenue consequences; hospitals, schools, roads'.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Pressure eases on government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION to delay closure of 21 mines is likely to ease immediate
strains on the public sector borrowing requirement, but do little to dent
overall pressures on government borrowing caused by the recession, Peter
Marsh writes.
Even after yesterday's change of heart by the government, the Treasury faces
mounting problems with the PSBR, which is likely to reach more than Pounds
30bn in 1992-93. It could climb to as much as Pounds 40bn the year after,
largely as a result of weaker tax revenues and increased spending on social
security sparked by the economic slowdown.
Mr Andrew Glyn, an Oxford University economist, believes that the shutdown
of 31 mines under the government's plans of last week would have added
Pounds 1.4bn to this year's PSBR, with roughly Pounds 600m added to the
figure in the following year. Mr Glyn arrived at these figures by
considering compensation payments for miners who would have lost their jobs.
He added benefits for workers who would have become unemployed in other
industries affected by the pit closures, and tax revenues foregone as a
result of lower economic activity in the regions affected.
After yesterday's announcement, the immediate effect will be to reduce
substantially the Pounds 820m which British Coal had set aside for
compensation payments to the 30,000 miners who would have been affected by
last week's closure programme.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: 'Moratorium until early in the new year'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, told the Commons
yesterday:
'The government recognise the concern at the speed of the rundown and about
the very great difficulties it would cause to the communities involved. We
have therefore concluded that, for the time being, British Coal should be
allowed to proceed with the closure of only 10 pits which they have told me
are currently loss-making and have no prospect of viability in the
foreseeable future.
'The pits which fall into this category are Vane Tempest, Grimethorpe and
Houghton Main, Markham Main, Trentham, Parkside, Cotgrave, Silverhill, Betws
and Taff Merthyr.
'Nevertheless, it is clearly important that British Coal demonstrably meet
their statutory duties to consult and notify and take account of the result
of consultation. No closure will therefore take place until after the
statutory consultation period has been completed.
'In the case of all other closures and redundancies, I have asked British
Coal to introduce a moratorium until early in the new year except for those
which may be agreed by the workforce at the pits concerned.
'During this moratorium the government and British Coal will set out the
full case for the closures which British Coal planned and to which I agreed.
The government will also provide an opportunity for MPs to debate the
issues. In addition, we will carry out widespread consultation with all
those concerned over the next three months. We will then announce our
conclusions following these consultations to parliament in the new year.
'If, following this process, the government and British Coal's judgment is
confirmed then British Coal will proceed with a phased programme of colliery
closures aimed at reducing surplus capacity as soon as possible.'
On assistance to the coalfield communities, Mr Heseltine confirmed that the
government had prepared a package of measures to help people retrain and
find jobs, and that Tecs would have a role to play in this.
He also said that the government would create new enterprise zones to
attract new industry and long-term investment, and gave details of other
measures.
'On the basis of preliminary discussions with English Estates (about a
programme of property and sites provision) the government have decided to
make available to the corporation - and in due course to the Urban
Regeneration Agency - Pounds 75m of additional money over the next three
years. In addition the corporation will in this year spend around Pounds 10m
in these areas.
'The secretary of state for the environment is also making nearly Pounds 2m
available today to the Tyne and Wear Development Corporation.
'We have already announced that three areas - Doncaster, Barnsley and
Mansfield - will get enhanced status when the new assisted area map is
announced in the new year. More areas will be upgraded in the review. We
will continue to look at other areas.
'I intend to extend the coverage of regional enterprise grants to all coal
closure areas. This will help small businesses there with investment and
innovation projects. I will strengthen inward investment efforts in these
areas. I will see that additional resources are available to local
development agencies.
'The secretary of state for the environment is also acting immediately to
alleviate the effects of the closures. He is today setting up a coalfield
areas fund. Up to Pounds 5m will be made available for expenditure in this
financial year and next.
'These measures will all bring new money to the affected areas. We are
talking about Pounds 165m altogether.
'It will be important to ensure that the programmes mesh properly together,
leaving neither wasteful overlaps nor damaging gaps.
'For this reason I have decided to appoint a distinguished national figure,
who will be an adviser in my department, to act as co-ordinator and
facilitator at the national level.
'I am pleased to tell the House that Lord Walker has agreed to accept this
important responsibility.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Backbench appetite appears satisfied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SHOULD have been a gentle prelude to the new parliamentary session.
But as Mr John Major tucked into salmon pate and lamb with the executive of
the backbench 1922 committee yesterday, there must have been times when he
felt he was dining with the enemy.
Good-natured and amiable the prime minister's departure may have been after
more than two hours at the disposal of the men in grey suits, but Sir Marcus
Fox's remark on entering that the Carlton Club lunch - convened in honour of
the 1922's 70th anniversary - was 'a social occasion' fooled nobody.
Since its formation at a meeting of Conservative MPs which defied the party
leadership by repudiating the coalition with Lloyd George's Liberals, the
1922 has become the most powerful voice of Tory backbench opinion.
Though compliant and supportive when times are good, it has showed time
after time that it is not a body that the government can trifle with.
The executive members with whom Mr Major and his right-hand men Lord Wakeham
and Mr Richard Ryder lunched yesterday comprise the most senior and
respected of Conservative backbenchers.
With a weak, seemingly directionless government husbanding a Commons
majority of just 21, the power of the committee under Sir Marcus - its wily
and publicity-conscious chairman - has seldom been greater.
The 1922's rebelliousness should not be overstated, however. Yesterday, Sir
Marcus himself was rebuked by colleagues in front of the prime minister for
his outspoken criticism of the handling of the coal issue.
So the chances are that the committee's grandees will this week content
themselves with having demonstrated that they have the government on a tight
leash by helping to persuade Mr Major to slow down the pace of the proposed
shutdowns.
Certainly, the mood was relaxed enough as yesterday's lunch broke up. 'The
members of the executive were very happy with what the prime minister had to
say,' said one of the lunchers. Lord Wakeham beamed. Sir George Gardiner, MP
for Reigate, simply flashed a thumbs-up sign.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Tory rebels wait to test public mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS UNCERTAIN last night whether Mr Michael Heseltine's statement on the
future of the coal industry will be enough to bring Conservative rebels into
line by the end of tomorrow's debate.
Most MPs seemed to believe that, barring further upsets, the trade and
industry secretary's apologium will prove just sufficient to confine the
rebellion to a half-dozen MPs. If so, his compromise package will win a
narrow vote in the Commons.
Clearly, a significant number of potential rebels have swung back behind the
government. Mr Tim Devlin, MP for South Stockton, revealed that he had
planned to resign as parliamentary private secretary to Sir Nicholas Lyell,
the attorney-general, over the pit closures.
But he now had decided to vote, albeit reluctantly, with the government. 'We
have at least had some progress with this statement,' he said.
Similar conversions were announced by Mr Richard Alexander (Newark), Mr
Robert Adley (Christchurch), and Mr James Cran (Beverley) who described the
statement as a 'climbdown'.
Nonetheless, the verdict among some Conservative backbenchers last night was
that much may depend on the public's reaction.
Several MPs expressed dissatisfaction that Mr Heseltine had not included all
31 pits in the moratorium on closures and that the inquiry to be held into
the industry does not look set to examine an alternative energy policy.
Mr Winston Churchill and Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, two of the most prominent
protestors, indicated that they would continue to vote against the plan as
they were unsatisfied by the scale of the review and the decision to press
on with the shutdown of 10 pits.
Mrs Peacock (Batley and Spen) said that an initial judgment suggested that
the review would result in a slight delay of the closure programme and not a
thorough re-evaluation of policy. 'I don't think it goes far enough,' she
said.
Mr Churchill (Davyhulme) said that the review was inadequate as it failed to
take a strategic look at Britain's energy needs in the decades ahead. On the
Commons vote, he added: 'I believe the government will be running a very
great risk if they go ahead.'
Disquiet at the anger expressed in MPs bulging postbags means there will be
no complacency in the whips' office until the vote is harvested at 10pm
tomorrow.
Furthermore, the outcome will only be clearer after the detail is
unravelled. Yesterday many Tory MPs remained confused as to what shape Mr
Heseltine's review would take.
It was clear that some MPs are exploiting the government's vulnerability to
press for still more concessions.
If Mr Heseltine's compromise clearly fails to mollify the fury of the
public, now inundating MPs with up to 50 letters a day, then the current
could turn against the government again.
'Forty-eight hours,' said one government whip last night, 'is proving a long
time in politics.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Pits U-turn does little to relieve the
economic gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT'S partial U-turn over pit closures yesterday did little to
lift the pall of economic gloom that has descended on Britain since sterling
left the European exchange rate mechanism on Black Wednesday.
The news gave an slight boost to sterling and UK equities, which rebounded
from earlier lows, but this latest evidence of a lack of clear direction in
economic policymaking left City commentators un-impressed.
Although only 10 pits now face immediate closure, economists still expect
well over 100,000 jobs to be lost across a wide range of activities by the
end of the year. Fears that the UK recession might give way to a depression
were not banished by yesterday's adoption of a 'phased programme' to reduce
surplus capacity in the coal industry or Friday's surprise cut of 1
percentage point in bank base rates to 8 per cent.
The events of the past few days have come on top of steep falls in consumer
and business confidence. Mr Alan Hyde, a researcher at Gallup, said
yesterday that the latest findings on consumer confidence were the gloomiest
the market research organisation had recorded since 1979.
Gallup's latest poll, taken before the coal crisis broke and published last
week, found that more than half of Britons expected the overall economic
situation to deteriorate over the next 12 months while only one sixth
expected an improvement.
Surveys by regional chambers of commerce also point to a sharp deterioration
in confidence among businessmen last month. The London Chamber of Commerce
reported yesterday that hopes of business growth had been 'dashed' by
falling activity. The Leeds chamber said last week that business confidence
had 'fallen through the floor'. This grim picture is expected to be
replicated over the whole of the UK on Thursday when the British Chambers of
Commerce publishes its quarterly survey of business opinion, covering the
period between September 7 and September 25.
Mr Richard Brown, BCC director of policy, said yesterday that people in
business had been 'befuddled' by the absence of a clear economic policy. The
various speeches and statements from the government since Black Wednesday
had produced 'no inclination to invest'. The coal crisis could only have
added to the uncertainty, he said.
But according to Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers,
'loss of confidence is only part of the story'. Even if confidence were
strong, monetary conditions would still be too tight for the economy to take
off. The cut in base rates still leaves real short-term interest rates at 4
per cent.
'Against a background of declining personal wealth and the highest male
jobless rate since the 1930s, 4 per cent real interest rates are too high to
promote much growth,' said Mr Saunders.
'The last time that growth of wages, manufactured goods prices, broad money
and credit recorded their current weakness was in the 1960s. At that time, 8
per cent interest rates were considered penal.'
Professor Douglas McWilliams, the Confederation of British Industry's chief
economic adviser, said it was too early to say that the UK was in a slump.
'A slump would mean no recovery for another two years,' he said yesterday.
But Prof McWilliams believes the economic outlook is 'very tough'. Business
is 'likely to get worse before it gets better' while unemployment could rise
to about 3.5m from 2.85m at present.
The CBI will produce its next quarterly survey of industrial trends next
week, although this, like Thursday's BCC survey, will be based on
information pre-dating the coal crisis.
Prof McWilliams said the coal crisis was likely to have had a negative
impact on business confidence similar to that of Black Wednesday. 'I have
never seen an industrial reaction on the scale of that over the coal
closures,' he said. 'That points to a lack of confidence in the government
and more generally in the economy.'
However, Mr Peter Spencer, chief economist of Kleinwort Benson, sees a
silver lining for the economy in the sharp fall of sterling since Black
Wednesday, which should make it easier for exporters to sell goods abroad.
He said that in spite of poorer economic prospects in the US and continental
European economies, British manufacturers should be able to take market
share from competitors in Germany and France.
'The irony is that industry made great efforts to get its costs under
control in the ERM - that is what the present wave of redundancies is all
about,' Mr Spencer explained. 'Industry learned to live with the high value
of the pound by the time the UK left the ERM. The devaluation gives UK
companies a windfall opportunity.'
However, Mr Spencer warned that it would take some time before these
benefits were felt. Yesterday's partial reversal of the pit closures would
do nothing to strengthen confidence in the short term in either the consumer
or business sectors, he said.
Indeed, uncertainty about future policies and exchange rates may be
deterring UK companies from taking advantage of the devalued pound. Mr Brown
of BCC said exporters seemed not to be exploiting sterling's more
competitive level.
From his vantage point at the CBI, Prof McWilliams was more hopeful.
Anecdotal evidence suggested that some of Britain's large companies were now
more active in export markets, he said.

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Cabinet prays for deliverance with tied
hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major has retreated. He had no other choice. When the prime minister
met his senior colleagues on Sunday evening the analysis they received from
Mr Richard Ryder, chief whip, was as unequivocal as it was gloomy.
With the rebellion on the Conservative backbenches swelling by the hour, Mr
Ryder stated bluntly that unless the government swerved it faced certain
defeat.
A dozen backbenchers had stated publicly that they would vote against the
pit closure programme. More importantly, scores of others were threatening
privately to do the same. Mr Major faced the prospect not of a narrow
defeat, but of a rout from which his government would never recover. The
emergency cabinet meeting yesterday morning knew it had no option but to
recognise that reality.
Now the government must pray that the new package works. The signs last
night were that Mr Michael Heseltine, self-styled president of the board of
trade, may have to go further still to satisfy the disquiet on the
Conservative backbenches. Many want the independent inquiry demanded by
Labour rather than a phasing in of closures.
But either way the government is severely damaged. Last month the prime
minister's economic strategy was tossed aside by the speculators on currency
markets. With it went much of his authority in the country and on his own
backbenches.
Mr Heseltine is staying on. Downing Street indicated that there had been no
question of resignation even being discussed. After all, if Mr Norman Lamont
could survive the biggest U-turn in economic policy since the late 1960s, Mr
Heseltine could hardly be sacked for a medium-sized swerve.
But the Prezza, as he now likes to be known, will find it hard to restore
his reputation - impossible perhaps if he has to give still more ground in
tomorrow's debate.
Three factors ensured the defeat over coal. All three promise further
trouble as the government seeks in coming weeks to push through draconian
cuts in public spending and ratification by the Commons of the Maastricht
treaty.
The most important was genuine horror among Tory MPs at the scale and speed
of the proposed pit closures. The decision - and the apparently arbitrary
way that it was taken - reinforced the view that the Whitehall cocoon had
left ministers hopelessly out of touch with the mood of the country.
The fate of 30,000 miners replaced Europe as the lightning conductor for all
the discontent over the economy which has bubbled beneath the surface since
sterling's exit from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Tory MPs who have been promising their constituents economic recovery for
nearly two years are finding the excuses wearing thin.
The second factor is linked. The vacuum in policy left by the ERM debacle
alongside the fall in the government's majority to 21 at the April general
election has tilted the power balance at Westminster. In the 1980s the
government's majority was more than 100, leaving backbench Tory MPs as
simply lobby fodder. Now that they have real power they intend to use it.
But the third reason for the government's defeat at the hands of its own
supporters has nothing to do with coal. For one sizeable group of Tory MPs -
the Euro-sceptics - the furore over the pit closures was simply an
opportunity to weaken the prime minister.
The cabinet wants to bring the Maastricht bill back to the House of Commons
next month. The Euro-sceptics judge that anything that can be done to damage
Mr Major before then will reinforce their campaign against ratification.
Mr Major can claim justly that the arguments of many - even among those with
much purer motives - are riddled with contradictions. No one has argued
harder for cuts in public spending than those members of the 1922 committee
who have most loudly condemned the pit closures.
But the prime minister can take little consolation from the inconsistencies.
A party manager par excellence, he now presides over a party which threatens
to become unmanageable. One minister was driven to comment yesterday that
the rebels and the irreconcilables must simply be told to make up their
minds whether they want a Conservative government.
The problem is he could not be sure of the answer.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Ghost of campaign past drives Democrats: Carter's 1976
success in Ohio is lifting Clinton camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATIC party organisers usually recoil from any parallel with President
Jimmy Carter, the last Democrat to win the White House. But in the
mid-western state of Ohio Governor Bill Clinton's campaign is trying to take
a leaf from the Carter book and win it away from the Republicans for only
the second time in 25 years.
Mr Carter, like Mr Clinton the governor of a southern state, did well enough
in the conservative and rural areas of south and west Ohio as well as the
traditionally Democratic north-eastern belt to carry the state in 1976 by a
scant 11,000 votes.
'Democrats usually try to run very, very hard in northern Ohio to make up
for losses in central and southern Ohio. We made a strategic decision to
attack Ohio across the board,' says Mr Mark Longabaugh, state director of
the Clinton campaign.
Republicans, too, remember the 1976 campaign and they are determined not to
repeat the weak scores of President Gerald Ford in traditional Republican
strongholds.
Mr David Yost, a spokesman for the Bush campaign in the state, says:
'Although Ohio has a Republican base, they are independent Republicans and
you have to go out and persuade them.'
With just two weeks to go to the election it is the Democratic strategy
which seems to be paying off.
One poll published by the Columbus Dispatch showed Mr Clinton trailing
President George Bush by substantial margins in the Dayton and Cincinnati
areas of south-western Ohio, but more than holding his own in the central
and south-eastern parts of the state. He also held a 20 percentage point
lead in the north-east, which accounts for more than 40 per cent of Ohio's
votes.
That poll gave Mr Clinton a statewide lead of 7 points, but more recent
polls have shown a steadily widening margin of as much as 17 points, with Mr
Ross Perot, the Texas independent, barely making inroads.
Ohio's Republican leaders have voiced open dissatisfaction with Mr Bush's
campaign efforts. 'I have to tell you I'm a frustrated governor,' said
Republican Governor George Voinovich on Sunday, adding he believed the
election would be won by the Democrats 'unless George Bush can do a better
job between now and election day to define who Bill Clinton is in terms of
his experience'.
At this stage of the campaign Ohio's fate is critical to Mr Bush's chances
of re-election. The Republicans have all but written off their prospects in
California and Illinois, and with Michigan and Pennsylvania leaning firmly
in Mr Clinton's direction it is hard to see how Mr Bush can muster a
majority in the electoral college without Ohio's 21 votes.
Yet issues the Bush campaign has sought to exploit in the state - such as Mr
Clinton's espousal of higher fuel economy constraints, which could damage
carmakers in northern Ohio - do not appear to have swayed many voters. Nor
have Mr Bush's more venomous attacks on his opponent's patriotism and morals
done him much good, to judge by interviews with voters.
Indeed, Ohio has had its own bout of sniping, with the Republicans
suggesting the Clinton campaign had won the endorsement of former Perot
supporters by offering to pay off their earlier campaign debts, a charge Mr
Longabaugh dismisses.
At the same time Mr Bush's opponents say his campaign in Ohio is mirroring
the plight of his national campaign, where he has had to devote unusual
amounts of resources to traditionally Republican states like Texas and
Florida.
The president's visits to Ohio have been concentrated on Republican
strongholds such as the north-western farmbelt. 'It's fertile farmland, but
it's not a fertile place to pick up undecided voters,' says Mr Longabaugh.
But the state's Republican party has able campaigners and a strong
organisation. It is still buoyed by Mr Voinovich's victory over the
Democrats in the 1990 gubernatorial election.
And despite Mr Bush's difficulties, the Republicans appear at the moment to
have a better chance than they could have dreamed of three months ago of
winning one of Ohio's US Senate seats.
Democratic Senator John Glenn, an astronaut who has never won less than 62
per cent of the vote since he was first elected in 1974, holds no more than
a 3 point edge over his challenger, Lieutenant Governor Michael De Wine,
according to some polls - although other pollsters put his lead as high as
20 points.

MORGAN STANLEY, one of New York's leading investment banks, has scrapped its

The move underlines the growing efforts of the administration of Mr David

There were growing fears that a wave of departures was threatening the
city's economic and employment base; the city's onerous corporate tax
structure, along with high crime rates and high rental costs, have driven
several big investment houses to move their back-office operations.
Mr Dinkins said Morgan Stanley, which had announced plans to relocated to

to New York city and state in the next 10 years.
It has been offered real estate-related tax incentives and sales tax
exemptions to remain in New York.

MORGAN STANLEY, one of New York's leading investment banks, has scrapped its
plans to leave Manhattan after being offered incentives that will save it
about Dollars 39.6m (Pounds 23m) in the next decade.
The move underlines the growing efforts of the administration of Mr David
Dinkins, New York's mayor, to persuade big companies to remain in the city.
There were growing fears that a wave of departures was threatening the
city's economic and employment base.
In August, Prudential Securities, the country's third biggest brokerage
house, said it would keep its headquarters and back-office operations in
Manhattan after it was offered a Dollars 106m incentive package of tax and
energy rebates.
In the same month the city agreed to pay half the cost of a new Dollars 150m
trading centre to encourage three of New York's five commodities exchanges
to remain in the city, preserving 9,000 jobs in downtown Manhattan.
The city's onerous corporate tax structure, along with high crime rates and
high rental costs, have driven several big investment houses to move their
back-office operations from the city.
Morgan's decision to stay represents a considerable feat for Mr Dinkins'
administration. The bank had earlier announced plans to move to Connecticut,
had acquired an option on a building site and developed architectural plans.
Mr Dinkins said Morgan Stanley was expected to contribute nearly Dollars
911m in direct taxes to New York city and state in the next 10 years. He
said the bank generated more than Dollars 2bn a year in economic activity in
the city. The bank will retain about 4,100 jobs in Manhattan and Brooklyn.
In addition to the Morgan Stanley offer, the administration announced plans
to freeze corporate tax rates for four years. This is in addition to a
previous commitment to freeze real property tax rates.

FT  20 OCT 92 / IMF warns of errors in capital flow statistics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC policymakers could be making the wrong decisions because of large
and growing errors in the balance of payments statistics they are using, the
International Monetary Fund has warned.
After a three-year study of international data on capital flows the IMF
found the global capital account, which should reach zero because net
outflows from one country should be offset by net inflows in another, showed
an apparent surplus averaging Dollars 40bn (Pounds 23.20bn) a year.
The discrepancy has climbed by more than 50 per cent a year to reach Dollars
65.8bn in 1989, an IMF working party found. Actual errors could be even
larger as some positive errors cancel out negative errors.
IMF officials said inadequate statistics on capital flows 'call into
question the data on the basis of which decisions are taken and potentially,
at least, impair the appropriateness of those decisions'.
Bad data could, for example, affect the view of a country's national saving
levels or alter the management of sovereign debt problems.
The abolition of exchange controls in many countries, coupled with the
internationalisation of stock and bond investments, has made it more
difficult for countries to keep track of capital flows.
But the IMF found further errors arising from offshore financial centres,
multinational corporations, Dutch financial institutions and a 'deplorable
deterioration' in reporting by international organisations.
The working party was able to identify some gaps and make adjustments
averaging Dollars 23.4bn a year, but called on the leading industrial
countries to make an effort to improve their national balance of payments
statistics.

Mr Oscar Alberto Ramirez Durand, known by his nom de guerre Comrade

Mr Ramirez has been described by President Alberto Fujimori as the third

Mr Guzman after he and his deputy, Elena Iparraguirre, were arrested.
Mr Guzman and 10 of his lieutenants have been jailed for life on treason

FT  20 OCT 92 / Argentine debt deal 'put at risk': Resistance from some
banks undermining Dollars 23bn package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S chief debt negotiator said yesterday that resistance from a few
banks in accepting a foreign debt reduction plan could threaten the entire
Dollars 23bn (Pounds 13.3bn) package.
'It's take it or leave it. If the banks don't agree, there will be no deal,'
Mr Daniel Marx said.
However, he said banks were largely being won over and he was optimistic
that the reduction mechanism would come into effect early next year, as
originally planned.
The problem arises from the sharp decline in US interest rates which has
undermined the attractiveness of the package, piloted by Economy Minister
Domingo Cavallo, under which Argentina would convert Dollars 23bn in
commercial bank debt into two types of 30-year bond. At present Argentina
pays no principal and only Dollars 70m a month in interest.
Creditors could either take par bonds, which preserve debt principal but
yield a low, fixed interest of 4 per cent a year, rising gradually to 6 per
cent in the seventh year. Or they could opt for discount bonds which
preserve only half the principal but pay floating interest rates of  13/16
of a percentage point over Libor.
Low US interest rates have now made par bonds more attractive than discount
bonds. The difficulty is that multilateral agencies like the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund, which are backing the package with Dollars
2.4bn-Dollars 2.5bn in loans, would only lend if at least 35 per cent of the
debt was converted into discount bonds.
Argentina needs the loans, plus additional ones from the Japanese
government, to buy US Treasury zero coupon bonds as collateral for its
bonds.
A banker in the US said that Mr Marx had his hands tied. 'Banks realise that
if there is not a 35-65 mix, there can be no (debt reduction),' he added.
Mr Marx said close to 30 per cent of the debt had already been converted
into discount bonds, up from 25 per cent last week.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Japanese avoid decision on product liability law

A JAPANESE government panel considering the introduction of EC-style product
liability laws has declined to make a judgment and requested that another
panel be established to review the controversial issue.
The Social Policy Council, part of the prime minister's department, was
supposed to deliver a final decision yesterday on liability laws, debated
for 17 years and facing opposition from manufacturers who fear Japan would
become a more litigious society.
In the final report, a sub-committee of the council said a product liability
law was desirable, but its introduction was impossible without the support
of manufacturers, so another committee should attempt to reach a consensus.
Japan has no formal product liability law, and injured consumers have to
negotiate with a producer or to launch negligence actions. Since 1945, only
about 150 product negligence cases have been decided, and courts are
reluctant to set a clear precedent for fear of prompting a rush of cases.
The prime ministerial panel considered removing the legal requirement to
prove a manufacturer's negligence, and allowing an injured consumer to prove
only that the product was defective, a proposal modelled on EC guidelines on
product liability.
While not delivering a judgment, the panel said a new law was unlikely to
make Japanese consumers as litigious as those in the US.
The panel said the legislation would have little impact on economic growth,
while inflation would rise by up to 0.3 per cent if manufacturers added
liability insurance premiums to their prices.
In negotiations between Japan and the US over 'structural impediments' to
trade, Tokyo has argued that US liability laws encourage excessive
litigation, increasing costs for manufacturers and making US business
uncompetitive. However, Washington argued that Japan's present system gives
producers an unfair competitive advantage at the expense of consumers.
The Keidanren, the country's main business federation, welcomed the panel's
decision yesterday not to make a recommendation. But consumer groups said
the panel's decision was an unacceptable concession to industry.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Wheel turns full circle for Deng protege: The elevation of
once-disgraced reformer Zhu Rongji to the politburo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE knows better the capricious turns of the wheel of fortune than Zhu
Rongji, the man in charge of China's industry, who yesterday was vaulted on
to the standing committee of the Communist party's politburo, its most
powerful council.
From his new position of power - Zhu is fifth in the leadership - he is
expected to be the driving force behind the implementation of the party's
policies towards further economic liberalisation.
In his quiet moments, however, he may ruefully reflect that Deng Xiaoping,
88, has been both his nemesis and greatest patron.
Like many talented young intellectuals in the 1950s, Zhu, now 64, took Mao
Zedong at his word when he called upon the nation to criticise the Communist
party under the rubric 'Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools
of thought contend'. He was not aware that this was a ruse; what Mao
intended was to root out sources of opposition to his peculiar brand of
idealistic and autarkic communism.
When the Great Helmsman launched his 'anti-rightist campaign' in 1957 he
placed Deng in charge. Deng, ever the efficient one, rooted out hundreds of
thousands of intellectuals who were removed from their jobs in the party and
government. The brain of China was lobotomised.
From 1957 until his 'rehabilitation' in 1979, Zhu worked in Beijing in
planning and economic ministries. By the early 1980s he was on the move,
rising to the deputy director's position of the State Planning Commission
and lecturing in economics.
Deng also watched his progress and in 1987 Zhu was appointed mayor of
Shanghai, succeeding Jiang Zemin, the current secretary-general of the
party. In 1989, when students rioted in Shanghai, Zhu was able to restore
order without resort to the military.
Until a day ago Zhu was not even a full member of the central committee,
just an alternate, let alone on the politburo. But under the patronage of
Deng, the man who exiled him for 20 years, Zhu's rise has been
extraordinary.
Recently he was placed in charge of the cabinet's economic and trade office
from which he will have the largest say in China's economic policy. He is
solidly pro-economic reform and his elevation to the top group in the
Communist party has been taken as positive sign that China's elderly
leadership has been prepared to back up the rhetoric of the last week with
people capable of making it happen.
Zhu is one of three new members of the Politburo standing committee. The
other two, Hu Jintao, 49, and General Liu Huaqing, 76, are both seen as
reform-minded communists.
Hu, the former party secretary in Tibet, is the protege of Hu Yaobang,
Deng's first chosen successor who fell from grace in 1986. General Liu, a
veteran of the Long March and the man responsible for modernising China's
navy, is a close associate of Deng and fought with him during the civil war
against the Nationalists in the late 1940s.
They join Li Ruihuan, 58, a reformer and liberal-minded propaganda chief,
and Qiao Shi, 68, head of state security. Qiao is thought to be a moderate
in economic reform terms.
He is also a survivor. He argued against the use of force in June 1989 but
not enough for his loyalty to be questioned. When force was used he was in
the forefront of those justifying the action taken.
The party has increased the number of people in the politburo from 14 to 20,
with two alternates. Most are professionals and most are seen by Beijing
analysts as pro-economic reformers.
The party bosses of Guangdong, Shandong, Tianjin, and Shanghai were all
elevated to the politburo. The only hardliner of note to be appointed was
the mayor of Beijing.
The representation of the provinces and big cities is significant for two
reasons. First, these are the areas of China which have best taken to
reform; their leaders also have a keen sense of what plays well among the
people.
Second, the Beijing leadership has wanted them in the inner sanctum to make
sure they do not stray too far from party orthodoxy. The 'centre', as
Beijing is known, has had difficultly controlling the provinces and the
appointments of senior provincial leaders may serve that purpose.
But if the new appointments to the politburo suggest a victory for Deng and
his programme of economic reform, there is little evidence that the party
has any interest in embracing political reform. Li Ruihuan may lift the
leaden hand of the state from some cultural activities, but the party is
keenly aware that economic reform could also pose political and social
problems.
Of the full members of the committee, about 22 per cent are from the
military; when alternates are included, the figure drops to about 20 per
cent. For the past 15 years the military's representation in the central
committee has been on the decline, falling to 19 per cent in 1987. Although
this year's rise seems slight, analysts in Beijing said plans to liberalise
the economy further meant the party wanted to make sure of the military's
allegiance.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Clean sweep for China's reformers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S economic reformers scored a virtual clean sweep yesterday when they
dominated appointments to the Communist party's two key bodies, the
politburo and its standing committee.
As such the appointments represented another victory for Deng Xiaoping, the
country's 88-year-old pre-eminent leader. At the weekend the party endorsed
Deng's ideas for the rapid modernisation of China and in so doing embraced
deregulation and the free market.
At elections held yesterday, the politburo was expanded to 22 from 14 while
its all-important standing committee, which oversees day-to-day policy, was
increased by one position to seven. The retirement of two hardline
individuals from the standing committee enabled three reformers to be
appointed.
Jiang Zemin, party general secretary, and Li Peng, China's prime minister,
retained their positions, as expected. They are joined, however, by Zhu
Rongji, 64, the industry minister, General Liu Huaqing, 77, and Hu Jintao,
49, the former party secretary for Tibet.
Zhu is expected to be in charge of implementing economic reform; General
Liu, whose appointment makes him China's highest ranking soldier, will be
responsible for modernising China's army - the largest in the world.
Hu, a protege of the late Hu Yaobang, has been appointed head of the central
committee secretariat. Its five-member group includes Wen Jiabao, a
supporter of deposed party leader Zhao Ziyang.
The composition of the politburo reveals further the dominance of
pro-reformers versus those politicians who wanted to hasten slowly on
China's modernisation. Twelve of the 15 members outside the standing
committee are new appointments, most of whom analysts in Beijing identify
with reformist tendencies.
There is greater representation from provincial China, where economic reform
is well rooted. Central government ministries are also better represented
with Qian Qichen, China's foreign minister, and Li Lanqing, minister for
foreign economic relations and trade, both joining the body. Ding Guangen,
Deng's bridge partner, was also appointed to the politburo and may well be
Deng's eyes and ears on the council.
The new politburo is younger than its predecessor. The odd man out is
General Liu, but diplomats in Beijing said he was one of the only soldiers
capable of gaining the respect of the military.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Patten can expect tough time in Beijing over plans for HK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHRIS PATTEN, Hong Kong's governor, arrives in Beijing today for what is
expected to be a difficult round of discussions with Chinese leaders on his
plans for the colony's political development.
Yesterday the state-owned media gave full coverage to China's objection to
his proposals for greater democracy in Hong Kong and to his plans for
settling the dispute about the financing of the colony's multi-billion
dollar airport.
On October 7, Mr Patten put forward proposals for the conduct of the
colony's 1995 elections which provide for much greater democracy than for
those held a year ago.
The governor will hold talks with Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of the cabinet. At the weekend Lu was elevated to full
membership of the Communist party's central committee, as was Zhou Nan,
Beijing's unofficial ambassador in Hong Kong.
The tone of communist Chinese media coverage of Mr Patten, both in Beijing
and Hong Kong, suggests that Lu will be uncompromising in his rejection of
the governor's plans for more democracy.
The latest edition of Outlook Weekly, published yesterday, contained a long
article detailing confidential Anglo-British talks held in the weeks
proceeding Mr Patten's October 7 speech to the local Hong Kong legislature.
It said that on October 3, Lu delivered a strong response to a September 26
note from Mr Patten in which he sketched his plans for the colony's
political development.
Outlook said Lu told Sir Robin McLaren, Britain's ambassador, that for the
sake of Hong Kong's 'stability and prosperity', democracy should be
developed step by step. Its development should be consistent with the Basic
Law - the Beijing-drafted mini-constitution for the colony after it reverts
to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
The magazine was also critical of the way in which Britain informed China of
the governor's proposals. Mr Patten should have given a detailed, not
summary, account of what he was going to say, Outlook said.
'He should have listened carefully to opinions from the Chinese side and
reached consensus through discussions and revision before making an
announcement. Only in that way could his approach be regarded as being
responsible, co-operative and 'in good faith',' it said.
Prominence was also given to a Xinhua news agency dispatch from Hong Kong
about China's objections concerning financing the colony's HKDollars 163.5bn
(Pounds 12.7bn) airport and related projects.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Keating hunts for TV compromise: Australia's subscription
television troubles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S cabinet may decide today on rules for the introduction of
subscription television. On the other hand, it may not. Given the
government's dismal record on the issue, no one in Canberra is taking bets.
Mr Paul Keating, the Labor prime minister, has already changed his mind
several times about how to introduce pay TV, most recently last week. Now it
looks as though the rules are about to be changed again, adding to the
confusion facing viewers, television networks and Optus, the privately owned
telecommunications carrier which will provide satellite facilities.
Mr Keating initially suggested that Australia's three commercial TV networks
and the government-owned Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) would be
allowed to hold up to 45 per cent of the equity in a single four-channel pay
TV operator, which would have had a monopoly until 1999.
But in a policy somersault in June, he announced that two licences would be
awarded - one for existing media companies and another for new entrants to
broadcasting, who would be given a year's head start over the competition.
Now that model has been ditched as well after being rejected by the Senate,
the upper house of parliament, which Labor does not control.
Last week, Mr Keating outlined yet another plan to Labor MPs. This one
involved the simultaneous award of one channel to the ABC and two
four-channel licences for commercial operators, one of which would be
reserved for new entrants.
Mr Keating describes this style of policymaking as leading from the front.
But he failed to agree the plan with Senator Bob Collins, the communications
minister, the television companies, the leaders of Labor's powerful
factions, or the opposition parties which control the Senate.
The result has been a frantic round of talks in Sydney and Canberra at which
officials are trying to hammer out yet another compromise.
Only two things are certain: there will be protection for Australian
equipment manufacturers, and strict limits on foreign investment - probably
35 per cent of each licence, with a 20 per cent ceiling on individual
holdings.
The final plan is also likely to accept proposals from Optus to use to
digital compression, a newly developed technology which is not yet in use
anywhere else, instead of the long established analogue broadcasting system.
Digital compression would increase the quality and potential volume of
satellite transmissions, and avoid an expensive switch to new equipment when
digital becomes the world's standard technology.
But the other elements of Mr Keating's latest proposals raise a number of
tricky questions:
Why restrict satellite broadcasting to nine channels? Optus told a Senate
inquiry that it wanted to operate 24 national channels and a further 24
regional channels. Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation
(AOTC), its government-owned rival, is also believed to be planning to offer
up to 40 channels by cable within three or four years.
Why restrict the ABC to a single channel? Mr David Hill, its chairman, says
the plan would restrict the ABC to high-cost, low revenue news and current
affairs. He wants several channels to exploit the ABC's expertise in
educational, children's and sports programmes.
In such a tightly restricted market, how would the operator of the licence
for non-media groups compete with an experienced broadcasting group, which
would start with half the market? Many analysts think there would be no
bidders for such a licence.
'This does not make any sense,' says Mr Fred Brenchley, a Sydney media
consultant. 'It is a commercial idiocy which no one can explain. If we have
the capacity, why can't we have the full 24 channels and four or five
operators?
'The government has not made the mental leap that is required between
existing TV systems and what is possible with pay TV. They are still looking
at it as a political handout to their media mates.'
The 'mate' Mr Brenchley has most prominently in mind is Mr Kerry Packer,
chairman of Channel Nine, the top-rating television network, which could
probably outbid the rival Seven and Ten networks, which are both in
receivership.
Channel Nine would then dominate pay TV from the start, possibly in a
consortium with overseas media groups such as Time Warner or Comcast, the US
cable operator.
Mr Bruce Wolpe, a consultant to Comcast, welcomed the new plan 'because it
means a deal has been struck which is likely to survive the next election,
and that will give a lot of confidence to the industry.'
But it is far from clear that the government can strike a balance between
the competing demands of the three main Labor factions, the conservative
Liberal/National party coalition, and the Democrats, the small left-wing
party which holds the Senate balance of power. A compromise could involve a
phased release of channels, with more access for the ABC and tight
regulation.
At least one potential player thinks the government is wasting its time. 'I
don't know what they are trying to regulate,' says Mr Rupert Murdoch,
chairman of US-based News Corporation. 'With modern technology there is no
limit to the spectrum. You could have 100 channels, and when you do that
anyone can have a channel. Some will go broke and some will do well. What
does it matter?'

THE Indian rupee fluctuated wildly on foreign exchange markets yesterday
amid speculation that the government would soon make the currency fully
convertible for trade transactions.
The government last year made the rupee partially convertible - a key part
of its programme to liberalise the economy and promote foreign trade and
investment.
The speculation was triggered by a Reserve Bank of India announcement
warning banks to avoid speculating against the rupee in foreign exchange
markets. A central bank notice set a ceiling of Dollars 1m on the
speculative investment commercial banks could make in foreign currencies.
Since the Reserve Bank issued a similar notice just before the introduction
of partial convertibility, yesterday's circular prompted rumours that an
announcement on full convertibility was imminent. A leading foreign exchange
dealer said: 'Full convertibility is one possibility and it is the most
probable outcome.'
Mr V Janakiraman, deputy governor of the Reserve Bank, said last night that
the stipulation was merely to prevent the building of positions in the rupee
market.
Earlier, when word about the Reserve Bank's notice spread around Bombay, the
rupee fell in hectic trading before recovering slightly to end at Rs30.12 to
the US dollar (Rs51.84 to the British pound).
In the past, however, officials have said that the government's policy is to
introduce full convertibility on the trade account as soon as India's
foreign exchange reserves are large enough to protect the rupee against
excessive price fluctuations.

AN INQUIRY commissioned by the African National Congress has found that the
organisation severely tortured and mistreated prisoners detained in its
prison camps outside South Africa in the 1980s, but the ANC refused
yesterday to release the names of officials identified in the report.
Mr Nelson Mandela, ANC president, said the abuses it described were
'inexcusable'. But the names of those who carried out torture - many of whom
still hold senior positions in the ANC security department - would remain
secret. No action would be taken against them until after a further inquiry.
The ANC's failure to release the names of those involved has left the
movement open to the criticism that it - like the government, which last
week introduced legislation in parliament to keep state crimes secret - is
trying to cover up serious human rights abuses in its ranks. Mr Mandela said
an independent board of inquiry would be constituted to probe the charges
further and ensure that abuse did not continue.
'Some of the witnesses we saw have been brutalised and broken,' the
commission report states.
The government and the radical black Pan Africanist Congress will begin
their first formal democracy negotiations in Botswana on Friday, Reuter
reports from Cape Town. The PAC has refused to join multi-party talks inside
South Africa about a transition to democracy.

</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC OFFICIALS yesterday proclaimed a breakthrough in the Gatt multilateral
trade talks, declaring an outline deal with the US on agriculture and
services could be reached within the next fortnight.
After high-level talks in Ontario at the weekend, EC officials in Brussels
abandoned their customary caution and talked up prospects for a successful
end of the Gatt Uruguay Round before the November 3 presidential election.
Despite continuing signs of French reservations about the proposed agreement
to cut farm subsidies, the officials suggested the tide had turned in favour
of a deal, largely because it is viewed in Europe and the US as the 'last
best hope' for a world economic recovery.
Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, also voiced optimism yesterday.
'We're hopeful. We're making a little headway but we're not there yet,' he
said. 'We're trying to be flexible in these talks. We are not rigid but
neither will we break.'
Last week's warning by Mr Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, that the
US and Japan faced the most severe recession since 1945, may have influenced
the mood of negotiations as much as President George Bush's desire for a
boost to his flagging re-election campaign.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm commissioner, and Mr Madigan spoke on the
telephone at the weekend and are expected to meet within the next week or so
in an effort to crack outstanding differences: the extent to which the EC
must cut its oilseeds output, and formulas for cutting subsidised exports by
up to 24 per cent.
The Madigan-MacSharry meeting was described yesterday as the chance to
'clinch the deal'. Optimism has risen after the US conceded that
compensation to European farmers for price cuts agreed in last May's Common
Agriculture Policy reform should be exempt from the Gatt requirement to cut
overall domestic subsidies by 20 per cent.
Officials said rapid progress had been made in services, though differences
remain on the treatment of audio-visual equipment and maritime transport. On
financial services, the US and EC are near a deal, but divisions remain with
other countries, including Japan.
At best, the US and EC should be able to produce a piece of paper in a
fortnight which will proclaim both sides' confidence that a final text could
be agreed by the end of the year, or early January. But questions remain
about France's attitude to a deal so obviously desired by the US.
EC officials say there is no point in forcing the Gatt issue to a vote in
the Council of Ministers until a final text is agreed. Despite the
widely-held view that France could be outvoted in the council, some legal
experts in Brussels warn it is unclear whether all trade policy is subject
to a qualified majority vote under Article 113 of the Treaty of Rome.
Nancy Dunne adds from Washington: Negotiations were being watched closely
yesterday by the presidential campaign team behind Governor Bill Clinton,
which is concerned that a final package be acceptable to Congress. A
campaign spokesman stressed that no signal had been sent to Brussels to
indicate the governor's support for unsatisfactory US concessions,
particularly those made under pressure from the election.

FT  20 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brazil becomes computer compatible - A
notorious ban on informatics trade is to give way to tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's notorious informatics laws, which prevented imports of foreign
computers and ensured the country missed out on much of the 1980s
technological revolution, are to be abolished next week.
In spite of the fact that a combination of tariffs and high taxes will
continue to keep computer prices high, big-name companies such as Digital
Equipment Corporation, NEC, IBM, Acer, Bull and Hewlett-Packard are among at
least 13 foreign corporations which have already announced partnerships with
local companies to manufacture or distribute their products.
A further 20 or more deals with foreign companies were signed at a Sao Paulo
computer trade fair last month, according to Mr Carlos Rocha, president of
the Brazilian Computer Industry Association.
Jockeying for position - by both foreigners anxious to get at a Dollars 7bn
market and locals intent on survival under new rules - has been fierce since
Congress passed the law late last year.
Under that law, which comes into effect on October 28, import restrictions
will be lifted, though some relaxation of import rules has already taken
place. Gradually declining tariffs - which from the start of this month
range from 40 per cent for finished products to zero for vital components
not produced locally - will now present the main impediment to imports of
digital technology for both computers and telecommunications equipment.
Barriers to local manufacturing by foreign companies will be dismantled. The
only previous exceptions were for mainframe manufacturing by IBM and Unisys,
whose product lines had no local competition.
The old Brazilian legislation, established by the military government in the
1970s, has long been cited by free traders as a perverse example of the
protectionist policies common in Latin America at the time. Not only did the
Brazilian computer industry get stuffed into a technological time capsule,
missing out on many advancements of the 1980s, but the entire economy
suffered as all sectors were denied access to efficiency-boosting
technology.
The new law encourages joint ventures: foreign partners may own 49 per cent
of voting shares, and 100 per cent of non-voting shares, and the resulting
company can still qualify for preferential treatment as 'Brazilian' when
bidding for government contracts and credit.
Traditional arguments for partnerships are evident as well. 'We've got the
technology, and they've got good manufacturing capabilities,' explained Mr
Thomas Offutt, vice-president for international sales of Link Technologies,
a California-based maker of video terminals, about his agreement with Sao
Paulo-based TDA.
The new regulations have also been predated by liberal import approval
policies by once-pernickety Brazilian authorities. 'The opening began over a
year ago,' said Mr Zeke Wimert, president of Oracle do Brasil, subsidiary of
the US software company. 'You could bring in any hardware you wanted if you
could justify it.'
At the trade fair last month, Oracle software was running on 28 different
types of hardware, including Compaq and Digital systems. 'At last year's
fair, they were all national makes,' said Mr Wimert, who is also president
of the American Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo.
Despite this influx, the Brazilian computer industry has yet to fade away,
as some pundits expected, although production of micro-electronic products
and computer accessories are down sharply. Mr Rocha admitted to a 'partial
de-industrialisation'.
Some of the more than 300 Brazilian hardware companies have indeed gone out
of business or merged with competitors, but about 90 per cent of sales were
already concentrated in about 70 companies, Mr Rocha said. 'We used to talk
about 300 companies, but some of those were small businesses that just
assembled kits.'
Despite the dismantling of protectionist barriers, high tariffs and high
taxes - with resulting high prices - will encourage the widespread
contraband market, especially in components and personal computers. Mr Rocha
estimated that of the 250,000 units of microcomputers and accessories sold
each year in Brazil, about 150,000 were smuggled into the country.

FT  20 OCT 92 / World Trade News: ABB urges India to stick by rail deal

ASEA Brown Boveri, the European engineering combine, yesterday urged India
not to abandon a controversial Dollars 190m (Pounds 110.4m) contract to buy
imported high-tech locomotives.
ABB executives, in India to plead their case, insisted New Delhi should
stick to its March decision to award the contract to ABB after a
four-and-a-half-year bidding process.
ABB won the contract for the supply of 30 locomotives against tough
competition from three other international bidders, including a partnership
between Sumitomo and Hitachi, the Japanese trading and engineering
companies. But protests have since surfaced on the grounds that India does
not need expensive imported technology when it has large railway workshops
of its own. The government has yet to sign a contract with ABB, or indicate
when one might be signed.
The arguments show that despite the economic liberalisation programme
launched by the government of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao, doing business
in India can still be fraught with problems. ABB, which has a large Indian
affiliate employing 4,000, has been supplying Indian railways since the
1960s. When India decided in the early 1980s to start replacing some of its
steam- and diesel-powered locomotives with electric ones, ABB was a
front-runner. In 1986, it supplied six of 18 electric locomotives India
imported on an experimental basis.
Locomotive technology then underwent a drastic change, with the
introduction, principally by ABB, of a new generation of
micro-chip-controlled alternating-current engines. So, when India invited
offers for 30 more locomotives, it was able to consider a more modern
engine, but one which was more expensive.
After four years' deliberation, the railway ministry awarded the contract to
ABB, but the decision went for review before the railway convention
committee, a government panel. The panel recently advised the government to
act in its own best judgment, but only after committee members had dropped
hints urging scrapping of the contract.
The committee's concerns focused on the cost of the project and a desire to
promote India's own engineering industry. Members questioned whether it
would not be better to buy home-made locomotives costing about a tenth the
price of the imports. Yesterday, Mr Amandus Jaeger, vice-president of ABB
Transportation Systems Switzerland, an ABB subsidiary, said the advantages
of the new-generation technology for India were 'tremendous'. The contract
included the transfer of the technology needed to make them. India would be
able to produce the new high-tech engines in Indian factories.

FT  20 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Japanese to keep foreign rice ban
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's agriculture ministry insisted yesterday that the rice market would
remain closed to imports regardless of EC-US negotiations on farm products
trade.
Tokyo has watched the apparent progress in US-EC talks anxiously, as the
present factional struggles within the ruling Liberal Democratic party (LDP)
have distracted party leaders from the politically-sensitive issue of rice
imports.
The agriculture ministry said the ban would not be relaxed, even if the EC
and US reach a formal and final agreement as part of Gatt's Uruguay Round.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external relations commissioner, has said
multilateral farm talks could resume soon. His comment followed a weekend
meeting with trade ministers from the US, Japan and Canada, at which
negotiators were said to be on the verge of making progress on the
outstanding issues of farm subsidies and oil seeds.
An understanding exists among senior LDP officials that rice imports must
eventually be allowed, if only in limited amounts. But last week's
resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the party's powerbroker, reduced any
prospects for liberalisation.
Mr Kanemaru was one of few Japanese politicians with the prestige needed to
deal with an issue as complex as rice. He is known to have accepted that
opening the rice market was inevitable.
But before opening the market, the LDP would have to begin talks with the
influential farm lobby. Few LDP politicians want to be linked with the
change of policy on rice, which the farm groups say has a sacred role in
Japanese life.
Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, said yesterday that the Japanese
government was watching the progress in talks between the US and EC, and
would 'cautiously consider future events'.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Twelve in accord on minimum VAT rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC FINANCE ministers last night formally agreed to bring in legally binding
minimum rates of value added tax and excise duties across the Community,
ending four years of negotiation.
Britain, which holds the EC presidency, and the European Commission hailed
the long-awaited agreement as a large step towards the establishment of an
efficient barrier-free European market after January 1 1993.
Ministers came close to a formal accord in July, when they agreed in
principle to fix a legally binding minimum EC-wide VAT rate of 15 per cent
until 1996 and minimum duties on a range of other products including
tobacco, alcohol and heating oils. But the package of eight directives had
been held up since then by some member states' objections to specific parts
of the deal.
The agreement will leave VAT rates unchanged in most EC countries. In
Britain it is 17.5 per cent. But without an accord, EC members might have
been tempted to keep border controls as security against unilateral changes
in VAT rates by neighbouring states, aimed at attracting cross-border
shoppers.
Unanimous agreement on the package was in the balance until late last night,
as Britain and Spain argued for three hours about the tax treatment of
sherry in the UK.
Spain was unhappy about differing excise duties applied to Spanish and
British sherry. The UK product has a lower alcohol content and consequently
a lower duty.
But Britain last night agreed to narrow the differential between the two
products from 43 per cent to 25 per cent by 1996.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Serb power struggle leads to coup fears: Milosevic's forces
seize control of key building in Belgrade in showdown with federal
authorities
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SERBIAN police yesterday seized control of the Yugoslav federal interior
ministry in an apparent attempt by Mr Slobodan Milosevic, Serbia's
president, to wrest power from the Yugoslav prime minister, Mr Milan Panic.
The seizure reflects the intensified power struggle between Mr Milosevic on
one side and Mr Panic and Yugoslav President Dobrica Cosic on the other. It
also shows that the Yugoslav government has not yet succeeded in gaining
control over key federal institutions.
Following the break-up of Yugoslavia, Mr Milosevic has tried to usurp the
remaining power of the old federation. He controls not only the Serbian
interior ministry and Serbian paramilitary groups, but also sections of the
federal interior ministry.
The new Yugoslav federal leaders have been fighting back in recent months.
Mr Cosic has gained the support of top echelons within the army, while Mr
Panic has been trying to strengthen the federal institutions legally in
order to erode Mr Milosevic's power base, which is anchored in the police.
Both Mr Cosic and Mr Panic have urged Mr Milosevic to resign in order to get
United Nations sanctions lifted and stop the war in neighbouring
Bosnia-Hercegovina. But in the early hours yesterday Mr Milosevic
demonstrated his determination to preserve his power base by ordering scores
of Serbian police to enter and then seal off the federal police
headquarters, which is inside the Belgrade interior ministry. Federal
officials were barred from entering the building.
The move prompted speculation that Mr Milosevic was orchestrating a coup
against Mr Panic, although under such circumstances it is uncertain what
role the federal army would play.
In a statement yesterday the federal government strongly condemned the
'violent seizure of the interior ministry', demanding 'immediate
restoration' to federal control. The statement warned that the ministry was
'unable to fulfil its constitutional function which gravely threatened state
security'.
However, Serbian officials attempted to play down the issue, saying that the
takeover of the headquarters followed a ruling by a municipal court that the
federal interior ministry must abandon the building by October 15.
Nevertheless, the seizure also fuelled speculation that the Serbian police
were trying to confiscate federal police archives. Following international
moves towards setting up a tribunal on war crimes in Bosnia, the archives
could incriminate Serb politicians. Mr Cosic and President Alija Izetbegovic
of Bosnia held their first face-to-face meeting yesterday, Reuter reports
from Geneva. After long talks in Geneva's Palais des Nations they issued a
statement throwing their weight behind the peace process and condemning
so-called ethnic cleansing in Bosnia.

The EC council of ministers yesterday cleared a long-blocked Ecu350m (Pounds

doubt on how quickly food might be dispersed, writes David Dodwell, World
Trade Editor.
The credit was first earmarked for Russia last December as part of an
Ecu1.25bn credit for 12 former Soviet republics. It has been stalled by a
dispute over EC demands that Russia should waive its diplomatic immunity
privileges over offshore assets if it defaults on loan repayment.
Shippers noted that 2m-2.5m tonnes of wheat, barley and corn earmarked in
July for the 11 other republics were still blocked by technical problems.

<TEXT>
THE worsening European economic situation should be 'at the core' of EC
leaders' talks at December's Edinburgh summit, Mr Henning Christophersen,
financial affairs commissioner, said yesterday.
His comments to journalists, during a meeting of EC finance ministers,
reflect growing Commission frustration at governments' apparent failure to
tackle the real economic issues.
'Most people are now worried, not only about the situation in the UK, but
about the situation in the Community as a whole,' said Mr Christophersen. He
added that growth forecasts for the EC, which he will publish in the next
few weeks, were 'not very encouraging, to put it mildly'.
Finance ministers did not tackle the outcome of last Friday's Birmingham
summit in any detail. Instead, they have asked central bank governors and
senior central bank and treasury officials sitting as the EC monetary
committee (which meets in Berlin this weekend) to look into the reasons for
recent turmoil on the money markets.
Mr Horst Koehler, state secretary at the German finance ministry, emphasised
that the committee meeting had been planned for some time, and that a
realignment of the Exchange Rate Mechanism was out of the question.
Mr Christophersen said it was up to finance ministers to find some way of
stimulating the real economy. 'If they can't, they don't deserve to be
finance ministers,' he added.
Finance ministers yesterday concentrated on the 'Delors II' plans for the EC
budget, in particular the practical application of the 'cohesion fund' for
bringing poorer countries' economies into line with the wealthier EC
members.
At the moment only Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Greece meet the main
criterion for funding: per capita gross national product below 90 per cent
of the EC average. Ministers appeared yesterday to exclude adding other
countries before 1997, taking some of the heat out of rumours that Britain
might shortly become eligible.
Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, said: 'The cohesion fund is
reserved for the four countries which had per capita gross national product
of less than 90 per cent at the Maastricht and Lisbon (summits)  - that is
clear. Their names are well known.'
According to some EC diplomats, Britain is pressing for flexibility on which
countries are eligible for access to the cohesion fund. 'Any British
sounding may be more designed to secure their rebate (worth some Pounds 2bn
last year),' said one national official yesterday.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Moscow seeks fresh debt relief: FT writers on rescheduling
talks with Paris Club
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN seven decades after slamming the door on the capitalist world with
a repudiation of Tsarist debts to the west, Russia is trying to regain entry
to that club with a rescheduling of debts contracted during its communist
past.
In consultations with western officials, due to begin in Paris this week,
Russia will seek to hammer out a deal to ease the burden of Dollars
70bn-Dollars 80bn owed by the former Soviet Union to western governments and
banks.
With Moscow already way behind on payments this year and saying it can pay
only Dollars 2.5bn instead of the Dollars 20bn falling due next year, debt
relief is recognised by all sides as a necessary plank of western efforts to
help Russia switch to a market economy.
But disagreements between and among creditors and debtors make it unlikely
an agreement will be ready in time for October 29, the tentative date for a
formal meeting of the Paris Club - the grouping of western creditor
governments which takes the final decisions on such matters.
Russia, which is trying to persuade other former Soviet republics to give up
claims on Soviet assets in recognition of the fact that it is the only
republic to be making debt repayments, has already announced it will
probably have to ask for an extra two months of temporary debt relief when a
deferral of principal payments expires at the end of this month.
The creditors are divided over how generous they should and can be. The US
government, which has a relatively small exposure, favours writing off some
of the debts, but opposition to anything more than rescheduling is led by
the biggest creditor, Germany, which is owed 40 per cent of the debt and is
fed up with doing more to help Russia than other western countries.
The chief concern of German and other western banks, which are owed about
Dollars 16bn of the former Soviet debt, is to avoid the sort of deal
concluded by the Paris Club with Poland in 1990, when governments forced
banks to accept write-downs of 50 per cent on outstanding debt. Although
they are obliged to mirror any concessions made by governments, banks
believe that they can get better deals if left to their own devices.
'The Polish case looms dangerously in the background,' said Mr Klaus
Friedrich, chief economist at Dresdner Bank, the second-biggest bank in
Germany. 'We are obliged to wait for the governments to do something, but we
wait with misgivings . . . . We think it is economically necessary to
provide debt relief but that must be differentiated from debt forgiveness.'
Mr Yuri Gromushkin, the debt expert at Russia's foreign economic relations
ministry, denies that Moscow is looking for debt forgiveness. But he wants a
rescheduling package to include a reduction of interest rates on some of the
outstanding loans and a more recent cut-off date - the sacrosanct point
after which debts incurred are excluded from a deal. The cut-off date used
for the temporary debt relief granted until now has been January 1 1991. Mr
Aven has said that even if the cut-off date is brought forward to January 1
1992, a standard Paris Club formula of a ten-year rescheduling with a
five-year grace period would not be enough.
Mr Gromushkin also appealed for western help to persuade Ukraine to agree to
a special arrangement allowing Russia exclusive management of relations with
western creditors but giving the second most populous republic a share of
Soviet assets in return for debt repayment contributions. Although Ukraine
agrees that a system of joint and several responsibility imposed on former
Soviet republics by the west last winter has failed, it has yet to publish
counter-proposals it says it is working on.
But Ukrainian officials claim bitterly that Russia is liquidating assets
which belong to all republics to gain favour with the west as the only
republic worth dealing with.
That charge is rejected by Mr Gromushkin, who says the only assets being
sold are some debts to the Soviet Union by former allies in the developing
world. The proceeds are being used to help repay debts and unblock personal
and charity accounts 'frozen' by Vneshekonombank, the state-owned bank which
used to monopolise foreign currency payments and is still the official
channel for debt repayments.
Even after a rescheduling of medium- and long-term debts is agreed, chronic
arrears on short-term debt, which totals 12.7bn, are likely to remain a big
headache. On July 1, uninsured overdue import payments came to Dollars 4bn.
Balance of payments figures agreed with the International Monetary Fund
suggest that Russia will still need about Dollars 18bn in external financing
next year even if it is allowed to pay just Dollars 2.5bn for debt
servicing.
The government is hoping to convert some short-term debts into medium-term
debts, and has also offered creditors some swaps of debt for physical
assets. In the end, creditors have no choice but to take what Russia agrees
to pay.
But the advantage of rescheduling is presented as enabling debtors to keep
borrowing and perhaps ultimately repay some debt, while banks can still
treat a loan as performing instead of having to write it off.
Some bankers in Moscow were pessimistic however that Russia would be able to
honour a rescheduling agreement even if it won the terms it was seeking.
Many agreed Russia's control of foreign currency revenues is still far too
chaotic to provide a reliable flow of cash to service obligations which
would remain after a rescheduling.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Shevardnadze overplays the Russian card: Steve LeVine sees
no sign of Moscow's hand in Abkhazia's rebellion against Georgia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE separatist rebellion in Georgia's autonomous region of Abkhazia appears
to be a largely indigenous uprising without the official Russian backing
alleged by Georgia's leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze.
Interviews with Russian and Abkhaz officers and a three-day visit to the
warfront revealed no Russian officers or soldiers, other than those attached
to local garrisons of the Commonwealth of Independent States, successor to
the Soviet Union.
While some Russian officers are openly sympathetic to the Abkhaz and a few
former Russian troops discharged from local bases are reported to be
fighting against Georgia, there was no sign of collusion between the poorly
organised, poorly trained separatist army and Russian forces.
Claims of Russian partisanship have been the anchor of Mr Shevardnadze's
efforts to solidify local and global support behind his deployment of
Georgian forces. The ex-Soviet foreign minister, who was elected leader of
Georgia earlier this month, asserts that outside involvement - some 1,200
men from Abkhazia's tiny North Caucasian neighbours have joined the fight
against Georgia, and are visible throughout the battle zone - threatens to
spark a larger, regional war.
The conflict on Russia's border could continue indefinitely unless peace
talks succeed. The Abkhaz have seized three dozen armoured vehicles and
hundreds of rifles from Georgian troops, and they believe the new citrus
crop will provide adequate economic support through the winter. The
Georgians themselves have huge stockpiles of weaponry from garrisons of the
former Soviet army, and also seem unlikely to back down.
Last week Mr Shevardnadze was quoted as threatening to take all of Abkhazia
by force if new talks failed.
Colonel Vladimir Arshba, a former Soviet commando who heads the Abkhaz
fighters, replies in kind. 'We think we must liberate all the territory of
Abkhazia from the invaders. We won't be slaves . . . We have enough forces
to counter their hardware.'
The conflict began in August, when Abkhazia - an autonomous, sub-tropical
republic of 550,000 people within Georgia - declared independence and Mr
Shevardnadze sent in tanks. The Georgians now control much of the south of
Abkhazia, stretching from the regional capital of Sukhumi. The separatists,
holding the north, are headquartered at the port of Gudauta. The frontline
is the Gumista River in Sukhumi's suburbs.
Mr Shevardnadze and other Georgian officials, while saying they trust the
Russian president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, allege that hardliners in Russia's
government and military have given sophisticated hardware to Abkhazia, such
as T-80 tanks. A Moscow newspaper last week claimed that Russian mercenaries
were fighting on behalf of the Abkhaz.
Col Arshba said he possessed 10 tanks. Russian sources say they are mostly
old Soviet T-54s. The Abkhaz also have up to 30 other armoured vehicles and
10 heat-seeking anti-aircraft missiles, one of which on October 11 shot down
a Georgian-piloted SU-25 fighter.
But the colonel and other officers insisted almost all the munitions were
seized in battle against Georgia. Conversely, Col Arshba offered a list of
weapons he claimed the Georgians have received from the former Soviet 10th
Motorised Infantry Division, a list partially substantiated by foreign
journalists in Georgia.
It included 108 tanks, 170 other armoured vehicles and eight multiple-firing
GRAD missile launchers. The CIS has an airbase at Gudauta, an army base at
Sukhumi and a paratrooper regiment at Eshera, north of Sukhumi at the Abkhaz
frontline.
'I have been approached many times to take part in the conflict,' said the
Russian commander in Eshera, Captain Roman. 'But I am a military man, so I
cannot participate.'
The CIS commander in Abkhazia, General Alexei Sigutkin, refused interviews.
But Capt Roman vowed to protect his eight armoured vehicles from seizure by
fighters of either side.
'I would use all my ammunition to shoot everyone,' he said, 'then use the
combat vehicles to get out of here.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / Poland's budget hit by rejection of pension cuts
</HEADLINE>

   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Polish parliament has rejected government plans to cut pensions in a
blow to the cabinet's budget deficit reduction proposals before scheduled
talks with the International Monetary Fund.
The proposed pension cuts were designed to save 1,800bn zlotys (Pounds
74.3m) over the rest of this year and 23,000bn zlotys in 1993. They were
central to the government's plans, agreed with the IMF, to keep the budget
deficit within 7.5 per cent of gross domestic product this year and 5.5 per
cent of GDP in 1993.
The government's additional plans for a 3 per cent increase in turnover tax
and a 6 per cent import surcharge to increase revenues by a further 23,000bn
zlotys next year survived the preliminary vote in parliament.
Mr Jerzy Osiatynski, the finance minister, yesterday said that he would seek
alternative cuts in housing, transport and agricultural spending to
compensate for parliament's refusal to cut pensions.
The spending cuts and higher taxes are part of a package discussed with the
IMF which is hoping to sign a letter of intent with the Polish government by
mid-November.
Failure to cut spending on pensions will complicate talks with the Fund, but
Mr Osiatynski signalled that the government would renew its attempt to rein
in pensions growth next year.
If successful, he said, the cost to the budget of the delay would only be
12,000bn zlotys.
Agreement on a new 18 months' standby agreement with the IMF is essential if
Poland is to press ahead with debt reduction talks with commercial banks to
whom it owes Dollars 12.2bn (Pounds 7bn).
It also needs an IMF agreement to be in place to receive a further 20 per
cent reduction of western government debt in 1994 as part of the 50 per cent
write-down in the Dollars 30bn official debt agreed last year.
Meanwhile, the Central Statistical Office said that industrial output rose
by 13.1 per cent in September compared with the same month last year and by
0.6 per over the first nine months of the year as a whole.
The recovery of industrial output after two years of sharp decline was,
however, accompanied by a renewed burst of inflation.
Retail prices rose by 5.3 per cent in September compared with the previous
month in one of the largest monthly increases for two years.
The rise, fuelled mainly by mounting costs of food, brought prices to a
level 34.1 per cent higher than the start of the year.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Uncertainty in power industry after climbdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COAL welcomed the government's reprieve of threatened mines and its
promised review of the energy market last night. But the rest of the UK
power industry was plunged into uncertainty by the about-turn on pit
closures.
The move is likely to force a postponement of the privatisation of British
Coal, originally due next year. Electricity companies also fear that the
government will now put pressure on them to raise their purchases of
coal-based power to help keep extra pits in business.
Under the privatisation schedule, all contracts between British Coal and the
electricity industry are supposed to be freely negotiated from next April.
British Coal said a review of the energy market would expose the
difficulties it is facing, particularly the threat of gas-fired power
stations which it says are squeezing out coal.
But, the company added: 'It would require a significant change in these
market realities for a UK coal industry on anything like the present scale
to survive. It is not in British Coal's power to alter the fundamentals of
the market for power station fuel supplies.'
If the review means a larger coal industry than once planned, the government
would have to intervene in the electricity market to make room for extra
coal - there is already a vast oversupply with nearly 50m tonnes in
stockpile. Intervention would take the form of further subsidies, or direct
action by government to shut off alternative fuels.
Mr Heseltine's action yesterday reprieved mines capable of producing 22m
tonnes a year. have no need.
The generators have agreed to take 40m tonnes of coal when contracts expire
in March, but they are already having difficulty finding a market for their
electricity among the distribution companies.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive of PowerGen, one of the two large generators,
said: 'We share the government's desire to see an early conclusion to the
linked negotiations with the regional electricity companies and British Coal
for contracts after March 1993.'
It was clear that yesterday's decision was so rushed that Mr Michael
Heseltine's Department of Trade had not had time to consider the wider
implications for the closely interlinked energy market. The DTI was unable
to say last night how it would deal with the likely knock-on effects.
The government had been hoping to put enabling legislation for the
privatisation before parliament this autumn. That may still go ahead, but
actual sale negotiations will not be able to proceed so long as there is
uncertainty about the number of pits that is to be kept open.
Among the courses of action open to the government to stimulate demand for
coal would be to scale back the nuclear power industry, which receives more
than Pounds 1bn a year in subsidies, curb imports of electricity and coal,
or halt the construction of gas-fired power stations.
Mr Heseltine indicated yesterday that he would consult Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the regulator of the electricity industry who is conducting a
review of electricity supply prices, including the effect the growing role
of gas as a fuel would have on the industry.
Prof Littlechild said he would speed up parts of his review if necessary. 'I
will wish to discuss with all those concerned how best I can assist the
consultations planned.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / Pound falls sharply in nervous market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POUND fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday as the government's
decision to postpone the pit closure programme failed to quell nervousness
among investors about the UK's political and economic outlook.
A rally after the announcement by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and
industry secretary, was shortlived. It closed more than 2 1/2 pfennigs lower
at DM2.4200 and also fell against the dollar, finishing in London at Dollars
1.6320 compared with Friday's close of Dollars 1.6570. In New York, sterling
finished at DM2.43325 and Dollars 1.625. In early Far East trade today it
was quoted at DM2.4405 and Dollars 1.6225.
The government's action gave a slight boost to share prices. The FT-SE 100
share index rose 20 points from its low of the day to close just 1.7 lower
at 2,562.2.
But the announcement failed to restore confidence in the government's
handling of the economy, already damaged by the hasty nature of Friday's 1
percentage point cut in base rates. The market is also worried that Mr John
Major will not be able to fend off a backbench rebellion in tomorrow's coal
debate.
Fears about inflation and the pound pushed prices of longer-dated government
bonds downwards as investors chose the relative safety of shorter-dated and
index-linked bonds. A Pounds 100m tranche of index-linked stock issued by
the Bank of England was exhausted by lunchtime.

FT  20 OCT 92 / U-turn gives stay of execution to 21 pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT bowed yesterday to the national storm of protest provoked by
its planned run-down of the coal industry by agreeing a temporary reprieve
for 21 of the 31 pits earmarked for closure.
The embarrassing climbdown, announced to MPs after an emergency meeting of
the cabinet had been told that its original programme faced certain defeat
at Westminster, will give temporary job security to 22,000 of the more than
30,000 miners threatened with redundancy. It may also delay for a year the
privatisation of British Coal.
But in spite of a broad welcome from most Conservative MPs, it remained
uncertain whether the moratorium and an associated government study would be
sufficient to head off pressure among MPs for a far-reaching review of the
energy industry.
Amid angry scenes in the House of Commons, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, said the closure of 10 loss-making pits would go ahead
after completion of the statutory 90-day review procedure.
The remaining 21 would stay open at least until early next year. But Mr
Heseltine emphasised that his willingness to allow wide-ranging
consultations about the industry's future had not altered his conviction
that the case for a radical reduction in capacity was 'compelling'.
The U-turn marked another serious blow to the authority of Mr John Major's
embattled government, and put a question mark over its ability to push
through plans for drastic cuts in government spending programmes next year.
It also left the personal political standing of Mr Heseltine severely
dented. He emerged from a two-hour grilling in the Commons to face renewed
demands from some Conservative MPs for his resignation.
Mr Heseltine, who apologised to MPs for the handling of last week's
announcement but refused to budge on the economic judgment behind his
decision, was driven at one point to tell jeering opposition MPs to 'stop
being so bloody stupid'.
Senior ministers calculated that the volte-face would be enough to avert a
full-scale rebellion by Tory backbenchers when the Commons debates the
future of the coal industry tomorrow. The ministers acknowledged, however,
that Mr Heseltine needed to win over more potential rebels in private
meetings today with backbench MPs.
Some prominent critics of the closures, including Mr Winston Churchill,
indicated they were still prepared to back Labour demands for an independent
inquiry embracing a strategic analysis of all Britain's energy resources. Mr
Churchill believes the privatised electricity industry has 'rigged' the
energy market against coal.
Last night Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the cross-party Commons
trade and industry committee, said his committee would launch a wide-ranging
review of energy strategy.
Some Conservative MPs appeared unimpressed by Mr Heseltine's simultaneous
announcement of a package of aid worth Pounds 165m to regenerate the areas
hit by the pit closures.
The aid programme - which includes Pounds 75m of new money for English
Estates to provide factory sites and another Pounds 75m extra for training
schemes - will be overseen by Lord Walker, former cabinet minister and now
chairman-designate of the planned Urban Regeneration Agency.
Mr Heseltine said the government would also introduce new enterprise zones
while other areas would be upgraded to assisted area status next year.
Mr Robin Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, sought to capitalise
on remaining Tory disquiet, signalling that the opposition motion to be
debated tomorrow would not focus on 'scoring points' against the government.
Instead, it demands that no pits close until the Commons trade and industry
select committee has carried out a review of the costs and benefits of
closures.
Mr Heseltine said repeatedly that he saw no long-term future for the coal
industry at its present size. British Coal could expect to secure a contract
with the electricity generators for no more than 40m tonnes a year from
April against the present 65m tonnes. 'The economic case for a substantial
reduction in capacity therefore remains compelling,' he said.
Signalling his opposition to any independent inquiry, Mr Heseltine said that
during the moratorium 'the government and British Coal will set out the full
case for the closures which British Coal planned and to which I agreed'.
Subject to Commons approval, he then intended that British Coal would
'proceed with a phased programme of colliery closures aimed at reducing
surplus capacity as soon as possible'. Any changes in the programme
ultimately were likely to be 'at the margin'.
Mr Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, and
other miners' leaders insisted they would continue their campaign to have
all pit closures halted. The Trades Union Congress said it would go ahead
with a mass rally in London on Sunday. Mr Norman Willis, TUC general
secretary, said: 'There has been no genuine moratorium. All the miners have
got is a stay of execution.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / Broker finds green solution to case of the missing shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCUMENTS potentially worth more than Pounds 30m disappeared from a
Birmingham stockbroker's office on Friday and nobody knows if they were
stolen or accidentally put out with the rubbish.
The missing papers were letters of allotment destined for investors who
bought shares in the Pounds 61.7m flotation of Trinity Holdings, which -
ironically - builds chassis for dustcarts as well as Dennis fire engines and
buses.
The few hundred letters, which covered 25m shares, were delivered by a
security firm to the office of stockbroker Albert E. Sharp early on Friday
morning, before the receptionist arrived. Someone signed for them, but the
box was not there when executives looked for it later.
Such letters can normally be used to deal in shares until formal share
certificates are printed. They have to be sent to shareholders before
dealings in the shares can begin, and their disappearance could have delayed
yesterday's start to the company's Stock Exchange career.
But anyone trying to deal in the missing letters will be easily caught.
When their absence was discovered, Sharp and Baring Brothers, Trinity's
merchant bank, quickly arranged for new letters to be printed on green,
rather than white, paper. It has yet to be decided who will pay for the
second print run.
These were posted on Saturday and dealings began yesterday as planned. The
shares closed at 129p, a comfortable premium to the 120p issue price.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Technology: Apple ties up to dock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Apple Computer has introduced a new option for the growing numbers of
'two-computer' users. The Macintosh Duo Dock system eliminates the task of
switching files and data between a desktop PC in the office and a notebook
computer used when travelling.
The new system lets users insert - or dock - a specially designed version of
the Macintosh Powerbook notebook computer into a desktop receptacle with
connections to a full-sized display and keyboard, printer and other
peripherals.
Thus, the PC user no longer needs two computers. He or she can carry the
portable Powerbook on business trips and then slot it into the Duo Dock when
returning to the office.
Other computer makers already offer similar docking systems, but Apple
appears to have developed the most practical solution to a problem that is
becoming increasingly widespread with the growing use of portable PCs.
'Users get a Macintosh desktop computer and a Macintosh Powerbook computer
in a single system,' says Randy Battat, vice president of Apple's portable
computing division. 'They can keep all their files with them and eliminate
the file management problems that come from working on two separate
computers.'
Unlike other docking stations, the Duo system allows users to go from
desktop computer to notebook computer in one simple step.
In particular, it eliminates the need to reconfigure applications programs
each time the computer is taken in or out of a docking bay.
The disappointing aspect of the announcement is that existing versions of
the Powerbook do not fit in the new Duo Dock.
Apple is offering two docking systems. The Duo Dock is designed for offices
with local area networks. It is priced, in the US, at Dollars 1,079. The Duo
Mini Dock, for individual users, will be priced at Dollars 589 and will be
available in December.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Technology: Fewer jobs in the high-tech sector - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
High-technology industries are frequently called an 'engine for economic
growth'. Many have mistakenly taken this to mean that growth in
high-technology industries will lead to rising employment, offsetting the
declines in 'maturing' industries.
Yet recent trends in the electronics and computer sectors raise serious
questions about the presumption that technology will continue to create new
jobs.
Just this month Compaq Computer cut its workforce, in the US and Scotland,
by 1,000 people and Hewlett-Packard announced plans to reduce employment by
2,700 over the next few months. Apple Computer is closing a California plant
with the loss of 345 jobs. Amdahl is cutting back by 900, and at Cray
Research 650 employees must go.
All this comes against the backdrop of 'downsizing' at IBM, which expects to
reduce its workforce by 40,000 this year, and at Digital Equipment which is
cutting 28,000 jobs.
US information-technology industries, far from representing a source of jobs
growth, have become significant contributors to rising unemployment. In the
US alone, employment in electronics industries has declined by about 10 per
cent, or 265,000 jobs, over the past three years, according to data compiled
by the American Electronics Association (AEA), a US industry trade group.
'It is rapidly becoming apparent that this pattern (of declining employment)
is not of short-term duration and not wholly the result of the recent
recessionary period,' Richard Iverson, AEA president and chief executive,
has concluded.
The AEA and several other industry groups have laid the blame for US job
losses on Japan. 'Although the world market for electronics products and
services has been expanding, our share of that pie has been shrinking
dramatically,' Iverson says.
Others have defined the problem in terms of declining international
competitiveness, suggesting that the US and European electronics
manufacturers are falling behind those of Japan and other Asian countries.
However, it is becoming increasingly evident that there is an underlying
trend towards lower employment in high-technology industries that has little
to do with either global competitiveness or 'closed' markets.
Put simply, it takes fewer people to develop, build and sell a computer or a
chip or a piece of communications equipment today than it did a few years
ago.
Hewlett-Packard, for example, has increased its revenue per worker by about
50 per cent over the past four years. Other high-tech companies are making,
or striving to make, similar strides in worker productivity. Even at
companies that are increasing their share of the world market the workforce
is shrinking.
High-technology industries are becoming highly automated industries.
Computer designers rely increasingly upon computer-aided design systems.
Factories that produce semiconductor chips, disk drives and computers are
full of robots. PCs are sold over the telephone in minutes.
The pace of automation in high-technology industries is currently
outstripping market growth. More importantly, few within the industry
anticipate a reversal of this trend, even when general economic conditions
improve.
The drive to raise productivity and thus international competitiveness in
high-technology industries is accelerating the trend toward lower
employment, rather than alleviating it.
Does this mean that governments should no longer support efforts to boost
technology leadership? On the contrary, while high-technology industries may
no longer be as fertile a source of new jobs in the 1990s as they were in
the 1980s, the computers and robots and communications equipment that
high-tech companies build have become the essential work tools of all types
of enterprise. This makes technology leadership vital to international
industrial competitiveness.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Make Germany's consensus work
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SOLIDARITY talks instigated by Mr Helmut Kohl more than a month ago
appear to be spluttering into life. The talks, aimed at placing the
financing of German unity on a sounder footing, are crucial to the economic
health of Europe. The sooner the participants get down to details the
better.
Mr Kohl himself has done no more than talk in general terms about sacrifice.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of the powerful I G Metall engineering union,
has been rather more specific and suggested that his members would accept
pay rises for the next five years that do no more than maintain purchasing
power.
Mr Steinkuhler does not go far enough, but he has shown that the unions are
ready to talk. His comments have been welcomed by Mr Theo Waigel, the German
finance minister, and Mr Norbert Blum, the labour minister.
Mr Steinkuhler also makes sense about the need for general tax increases,
which the government has so far refused to contemplate. He wants the tax
rises to last longer and be more fairly distributed than in 1991. According
to the RWI economic institute, the self-employed and the beamte (public
officials) have so far contributed only 1.5 to 2 per cent of their incomes
to financing unity, whereas manual workers have contributed about 4 per
cent. That is partly because neither the self-employed nor the beamte
contributed to the 1991 increase in unemployment insurance.
Productivity gap
Yet useful as these suggestions are, they do not address the problem of
rapid wage convergence between the eastern and western lander, for which Mr
Steinkuhler's union bears some share of the blame. The attempt to equalise
east and west German wages, given the large productivity gap between the two
regions, has proved to be a recipe for mass unemployment in the less
productive regions to the east of the Elbe.
Mr Steinkuhler says he wants more investment in the east, not lower wages.
But why should German companies invest there when they can get the same
labour at a fraction of the price in Poland or Czechoslovakia? The result is
that his west German members face higher taxes to pay for the unemployment
for which they are, in part, responsible.
The bargaining system in western Germany has contributed to the orderly
distribution of an expanding cake over several decades. But in the east, the
system needs to be suspended to allow west German companies to pay the
market rate there, with wage subsidies from the government a possibility for
those who fall beneath a certain level.
Wider question
All of this raises a wider question. The solidarity talks are based on the
premise that Germany's consensus model in politics and industrial relations
is still functioning and is not itself responsible for many of the
inflexibilities exposed by unification.
At least one of the parties in the centre-right coalition, the Free
Democrats, believes that consensus is the problem, not the solution. It says
that it has prevented the reduction in subsidies in the west and the
promotion of a more vigorous privatisation programme to help pay for unity.
It also points out that it was a consensus reflex which imposed the goal of
an over-hasty equalisation in living standards between east and west.
What could a pact realistically agree? If Mr Kohl accepts higher and more
progressive income taxes to close the fiscal deficit, the unions must accept
zero real wage growth in the west and a postponement of wages convergence
between west and east. Equally, if the government is ready to consider the
sort of profits levy favoured by the unions - one imposed on companies which
do not invest in east Germany - then the unions and the opposition Social
Democrats must accept a much tighter squeeze on subsidies and more
privatisation in the west.
Paradoxically, Germany is suffering from both too much and too little
consensus. Rather than abandoning the system altogether Germany needs to
apply it more sensibly. That means exploiting consensus at a political level
to tackle the rigidities that consensus has produced at the economic level.

Saturo Asami was shocked. His long-held beliefs about the benefits of being
Japanese had been dashed. Recently, his company, Ohkura Electric, a
medium-sized Japanese electronics manufacturer, fired him without warning.
Mr Asami recalled: 'All I got was a piece of paper; there were no
explanations.'
Mr Asami was one of 130 people Ohkura made redundant by closing a components
factory at Saitama, west of Tokyo, after the company had reported pre-tax
losses for the past two years.
As Japan's economic downturn spreads from property and finance into industry
and retailing, demand for labour is contracting fast. As a result, the
social contract which has governed employment in Japan since the 1950s,
offering workers at large companies lifetime employment in return for their
devotion to the company, is being threatened. Over the next year this
contract, one of the most distinctive features of Japanese capitalism, will
be put through its toughest test.
Figures published last week show that official unemployment is still only
2.2 per cent, well below the average for OECD economies of 7.5 per cent.
However, the labour market's health is deteriorating rapidly. For every 100
job-seekers there are 102 jobs, a ratio of 1.02, close to equilibrium and
sharply down from 1.45 in March last year. But soon there will be an excess
supply of labour as Japan faces what could be its worst recession since that
caused by the oil shocks of the 1970s.
Mr Shijuro Ogata, former governor of the Japan Development Bank, now a
senior adviser to Yamaichi Securities, said: 'So far this has been a company
recession, with companies taking the strain in the form of lower profits. It
could become an individual recession with people paying the cost through
employment adjustment.'
Whether the weakening of the labour market will lead to lasting changes in
the Japanese system will depend on how companies reconcile the traditions of
lifetime employment with the need to boost profitability after three
successive years of decline in the corporate sector.
Lifetime employment lends companies a potent mixture of flexibility and
rigidity. Employees at large companies are treated as if they are a fixed
cost with their base salary paid whatever the economic environment. But
companies demand considerable flexibility, and workers are often required to
shift between jobs. This implicit contract would fail if companies resorted
to large-scale redundancies.
Employers have another pressing concern which would make them reluctant to
sack people. Japan's low birth rate means that, by the end of the decade,
the country could face a labour shortage. Companies are unwilling to shed
workers now, only to risk skill shortages once the economy recovers.
The problem is that profitability is plunging. Japanese business has become
accustomed to very high rates of economic growth, and this has largely
shaped strategy. They generally carry high fixed costs - including labour
costs - which they cover by selling large volumes of shares, cars or videos
at relatively thin profit margins. When sales increase sharply, so do
profits. In a downturn, however, Japanese companies take longer than their
international rivals to restore profitability because they do not use
redundancies to cut costs in line with lower output.
The pressures of the current downturn may herald a prolonged period of slow
economic growth. In fiscal 1992, the economy is expected to grow by less
than 2 per cent, compared with 3.5 per cent a year earlier. The official
consensus of Tokyo economists is that growth next year will reach 3 per
cent, but many admit that it may fall below 1.5 per cent. In response,
companies are already reassessing their long-term cost base.
What are the prospects for the Japanese system of lifetime employment as
companies attempt to cope with these pressures? In the short run it is
extremely unlikely that the system will be threatened by a sharp rise in
officially registered unemployment. The economy, and total employment, are
still growing, albeit slowly. In August the male employed workforce was
39.2m, up 1.1 per cent from the year before; the female workforce stood at
27m, up 0.4 per cent.
Most economists do not expect unemployment to rise above 3 per cent over the
next year, mainly because companies are prepared to go to extreme lengths to
retain staff. Many have reduced working time. Total overtime hours in
manufacturing fell by 24 per cent in the past year, and total working hours
fell by 3 per cent last month.
Transfers within big companies are becoming commonplace. Mazda, the car
maker, has moved staff from production to sales in an attempt to sell its
way out of the downturn.
Some companies are going even further. Mr Noburu Hatakeyama, vice-minister
at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, explained: 'Many of the
electronics companies are paying staff simply to stay at home.'
To help cover the costs of this 'employment adjustment', industries are
queueing up to claim government help. The steel and software industry
associations have already formally claimed subsidies which help their
companies cover the cost of training laid-off workers for one year. The
electronics industry is expected to follow suit.
Such strategies suggest that a revolution triggered by rising unemployment
is extremely unlikely. But pragmatic reform is almost certain. The coverage
of the lifetime employment system will be reduced and its terms tightened;
its benefits will be increasingly confined to young, male, full-time,
white-collar workers.
Lifetime employment is largely confined to employees of large companies. The
gap between those in mainstream employment and those on the fringes of the
labour market will widen. The Japanese labour market is like an onion with
many rings; the outer rings will be peeled off first to protect the core.
Those on the extremities of the labour market - illegal foreign workers
attracted to Japan during the 1980s boom - are already being hit by
unemployment. The day labourers of the poorest districts of Osaka rioted
earlier this month, after relief loans were cut, because a slump in the
construction industry pushed up the numbers applying for jobs from a few
dozen to more than 1,000.
Unemployment is also rising fast among those who work for small private
companies. In August, the number of self-employed fell to 8.49m, down 3.2
per cent from a year earlier, while the number of workers at small family
enterprises fell by 8.7 per cent to 4.71m. In contrast, the number of
salaried employees rose by 2.5 per cent to 51.38m.
Many of these redundant workers are women, who in Japan often leave
employment without claiming benefits, and thus are not reflected in official
statistics.
Women employed at large companies, especially part-timers, are also
considered vulnerable. The rapid economic expansion of the late 1980s
attracted many women into employment, but many will leave the workforce in
the next couple of years without being replaced. The trend is already
evident; women's employment in stockbroking, for example, fell by 11 per
cent last year compared with a 3 per cent decline in male employees.
About half the 2,700 employees at the Tobu department store at Ikebukuro, a
commuter junction on the outskirts of central Tokyo, are women. Mr Isao
Kubokawa, the managing director, believes that despite a loss this year the
company will avoid redundancies. 'Within the next three years many of these
young women will get married and leave, so the workforce will be cut by
natural wastage.'
Members of two other groups - the young and the old - could find themselves
partially excluded from the system. Older workers are supposed to be the
most respected at Japanese companies, which operate systems of promotion by
seniority. However, the seniority system is starting to fray at the edges as
companies such as Sanyo, the electronics manufacturer, implement
early-retirement programmes for staff over 50.
At the other end of the labour market, young workers are being hit by
recruitment freezes. Job offers from companies employing more than 1,000
people were 51 per cent down in August compared with the previous year. CSK,
Japan's largest software house, plans a 70 per cent cut in graduate
recruitment next year, while All Nippon Airways, Japan Airlines and the
Central Japan Railway company all plan cuts of about 30 per cent.
For the next couple of years new membership of the inner sanctum of the
Japanese labour market will be limited. But even for those in the protected
core life will get tougher.
First, companies are becoming more selective about which managers they want
to retain and motivate. Performance is becoming more important in setting
executive pay, rather than simple seniority.
Cuts in executive salaries and benefits are becoming commonplace in both
manufacturing and financial services. NTT, the large telecommunications
concern, is cutting management bonuses by 5 to 10 per cent. IBM Japan has
imposed a pay freeze for 300 managers.
Companies are also streamlining their management. Mitsukoshi, Japan's most
famous department store, plans to cut management posts from 2,600 to 1,100.
Second, some leading employers are drawing up long-term plans to overhaul
their corporate cultures by encouraging individual initiative and promotion
by merit, as well as reducing their cost base. In June, Honda, the car
maker, introduced an innovative merit-based payment system to motivate
employees; the programme will gradually introduce an annual pay scheme based
on performance, rather than seniority.
Meanwhile, Nomura, the largest finance house, plans a 17 per cent reduction
in its workforce to meet increased competition from banks in a sluggish
securities markets.
Mr Richard Koo, senior economist at the Nomura research Institute, said:
'Other companies must be thinking of following Honda's lead because payment
and promotion by merit is the best way to retain the young staff a company
needs while cutting costs by paying less to those it does not need.'
Leading companies such as Honda and Nomura may be pointing the way for the
rest of Japanese companies away from a strict system of lifetime employment.
Slower growth over the next few years may force a gradual but significant
evolution in a system which has been at the core of the Japanese economic
miracle.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Leading Article: A government on the run
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EVEN AS formidable a politician as Michael Heseltine, president of the Board
of Trade, cannot make yet another retreat look like a victory. Last week the
government insisted that 31 pits should close at once. Now it offers at
least a three-month reprieve to 21 of those previously condemned. Regardless
of the merits of the case, such a defeat must be damaging. The UK would not
be better off under a mob rule of craven Conservatives and backward-looking
socialists, baying for more inflation and the preservation of any job,
however unneeded. The government has to impose itself upon events once more.
The dangers of a total loss of credibility are now severe. A firmly worded
commitment has once more proved to be written on water. Will a government so
terrified of its backbenchers be able to carry the Maastricht treaty through
the House of Commons? Will it be able to close redundant London hospitals,
any more than redundant pits? Will it be able to control public spending?
Will it, in fact, be able to govern?
Even over coal, more defeats may be on the way. First, the government will
have to get its revised programme through the House of Commons. Then it will
have to endure months of questioning over the closure of the pits that have
been given a reprieve. These will be months of demonstrations, months of
petitions, months of dismay on the Conservative backbenches and months of
wobbling on the frontbenches.
Long-term goal
The coal saga demonstrates the political advantages of privatisation. It is
partly because the government is held responsible for the coal industry that
a fairly straightforward industrial decision has created such a political
storm. It is partly because adjustment to economic reality was resisted so
long that much of the coal industry still seems to be unviable. Neither
consideration exculpates the political ineptness of the announcement of
these closures. But it does justify the government's longer term aim of
creating a normal private industry out of nationalised British Coal.
The economic case for closures seems equally persuasive, at least at first
sight. Keynes once argued that, short of any better cure for a recession,
people should be paid to dig up bottles full of pound notes that had first
been sunk into the ground. Paying people to dig up coal that is destined for
ever growing stocks would be just as foolish. By now it should have been
accepted, even in the UK, that it makes better sense to pay people to
produce goods and services that someone actually wants, even in a recession.
Independent review
Unfortunately, the government's economic case has a large hole in it.
Because of the botched electricity privatisation, it is impossible to be
confident that the 'dash for gas' is economically sensible. Moreover, while
the past militancy of the miners may justify some diversification of energy
supplies, the subsidising of nuclear power can hardly be justified at
anything like current levels.
It is because of the disquiet over the structure of the electricity industry
that the Labour party's proposal for an independent review of the coal
closures is appealing and may prove persuasive. If the political costs of
yet another government climb-down could be ignored, it would make good sense
to postpone the decision on coal until after a public review of the
implications of the structure of the electricity industry for the efficient
use of alternative fuels.
Politically, a review would also postpone the evil day of further closures,
perhaps to a time when an economic upswing is in evidence. Economically, a
thorough review would be the occasion for remedying the defects in
electricity privatisation. On its merits, this is an option well worth
considering.
It would also be another defeat. Since the government has picked a fight
with the wrong enemy at the wrong time, further defeat may even be
inevitable. All such defeats are damaging to the capacity to govern, which
is why it is important to choose one's ground wisely. But what the
government most needs is an overall economic strategy. With one, its
effectiveness might survive still more compromises over the coal closures.
Without one, it is in serious trouble.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Personal View: Struggle to fly solo
</HEADLINE>

Dan-Air's search for a partner is further evidence of the difficulty faced
by medium-sized airlines attempting to survive as independent entities in a
deregulated European scheduled market.
There are now only four truly independent scheduled operators of jet
aircraft remaining in western Europe, aside from those in Scandinavia;
Meridiana, Portugalia, Ryanair and Virgin Atlantic. Of these, Ryanair almost
certainly owes its continuing existence to intervention by the Irish
government to prevent Aer Lingus from directly competing on a number of its
main routes.
The belief that liberalisation would present charter carriers with an
opportunity to access scheduled markets previously denied them has proved
overly optimistic. The problems faced by Dan-Air in building a European
network of scheduled routes from Gatwick in the wake of Air Europe's demise
provides another illustration of this.
Preventing competitors acquiring medium-sized scheduled airlines based in
one's home territory is a vital part of the defensive strategy of several
top European flag carriers.
Access to airports with limited 'slots' has been a particular focus of
attention in this regard. For instance, British Caledonian Airlines' threat
to British Airways was not great while BCal was independent; but had BCal's
valuable assets been acquired by a powerful rival, then the new entity would
certainly have posed a problem to BA.
The 'tying in' of locally-based small and medium-sized scheduled airlines
has been a tactic employed by many western European flag carriers. Air
France, for example, has contracted smaller carriers to operate services on
its behalf. Brit Air and TAT, two French regional airlines, have been two
beneficiaries of this policy over the past decade. More recently, there has
been an increasing trend for a carrier to become a part-owner of a smaller
airline, in some instances even acquiring total ownership.
In any event, the European Commission's insistence that Air France divest
itself of several international and domestic routes and its shareholding in
TAT in order for it to gain EC approval to acquire UTA, has hardly resulted
in a rapid upsurge in competition.
In such circumstances 'biting the hand that feeds you' would hardly seem a
sensible course of action. Directly challenging the flag carrier may not
appear a particularly attractive proposition, especially if a complementary
role is on offer.
The deregulation of the US domestic airline market in the 1980s led to a
more competitive industry. Substantial gains in efficiency followed with
competition forcing the former trunk carriers to reorganise and reduce their
operating costs. Average fares fell in real terms and demand for airline
services doubled over a decade.
Today, these competitive pressures have not abated, being artificially
sustained by bankruptcy legislation that has enabled several financially
troubled carriers to survive. While consumers have benefited from lower
fares, the outcome for carriers in what has been a protracted economic
downturn has been massive financial losses.
If global consolidation is allowed to continue then it is conceivable that
the industry will ultimately be controlled by a dozen consortia. In such
circumstances competition is likely to be more controlled than during the
hysteria of recent years.
While much of the competitive pressure experienced by the US airline
industry has largely been the result of the entry of new carriers the real
innovators have been the larger existing carriers.
These companies - transformed into lean and efficient marketing-led giants -
have demonstrated considerable skill and imagination in attracting more
customers and boosting revenue.
Despite this transformation, the industry has yet to achieve the rates of
return on invested capital that are typical of other industrial and service
sectors, though shareholders and management expect this gap to narrow.
In the longer term competition from a comparatively small number of global
players will be sufficient to keep the airline industry lean and efficient.
While this seems a reasonable assertion, it is expectations about the extent
and nature of the competition that are of more crucial concern.
An important benchmark will be provided by the financial returns in other
sectors. As a consequence, airline shareholders are likely to gain a greater
share of the benefits of the improved efficiency that results from
deregulation; further cuts in average real fares would appear unlikely.
Old-style cartels are unlikely to return, but in certain respects the degree
of control that surviving consortia will be able to exert will give such an
impression. Choice will exist, but governments may need to tackle regulation
on a global scale if consumer interests are accorded too low a priority by a
more mature airline industry.

FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Sterling fall sparks interest in depressed
oil sector - Analysts revise their earnings forecasts as the pound continues
its slide against the dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER months of depression, the outlook for oil companies is brightening and
share prices in the unloved sector are showing signs of recovery.
Since the devaluation of the pound a month ago, Monument has picked up 22
per cent, Goal 23 per cent, Clyde 44 per cent, Enterprise 21 per cent, Hardy
39 per cent and Lasmo 32 per cent.
The latest monthly report on oil production from the Royal Bank of Scotland
estimated the pound's devaluation would add about Pounds 2.5m a day to the
value of UK North Sea oil production, taking it to Pounds 21.7m.
Analysts, meanwhile, have been busy revising their earnings forecasts for
oil companies. Hoare Govett, the London brokers, recently published a note
forecasting a possible fall in the average value of sterling to Dollars 1.56
in 1993, which would mean a doubling of profits for some companies.
Oil is traded worldwide in dollars, so a weakening of the pound against the
dollar means a higher sterling price for each barrel of oil. For UK
exploration and production companies without downstream interests, who
specialise in finding, producing and selling crude, such increases feed
through almost directly to the bottom line.
It was the downward drift in sterling oil prices, to a 20-year low in real
terms of about Pounds 10.50 a barrel in the first half of 1992, that was
largely responsible for the poor performance of oil companies and the
weakness of their shares. In the week before sterling's devaluation,
exploration and production stocks were trading at an average 40 per cent
discount to their asset values. Two years earlier, they had traded at a 40
per cent premium.
But there were other factors. One catalyst was the takeover of Ultramar by
rival independent Lasmo in December 1991, with an all-paper offer of 285p a
share, compared with City valuations of more than 400p a share for Ultramar.
With no company willing to step in with a higher (or cash) offer, the
takeover had a depressant effect on the whole sector, and the City of London
began to review its approach to the rest of the exploration companies.
Analysts have moved away from asset valuations - which value a company
according to the future potential of the exploration acreage in its
portfolio - and towards valuations based on cashflow multiples and dividend
growth.
Some in the oil industry also claim that investment analysts and fund
managers do not understand the way the industry has changed in the last few
years - particularly the increasing importance of gas, and the international
expansion by many companies. 'Many analysts aren't comfortable with the
concept of billions or trillions of cubic feet of gas, or with developments
in far-off places like Indonesia. They're much happier with barrels of oil,
preferably from the North Sea,' said a director of one exploration and
production company.
Some of these factors will persist. But UK oil companies and analysts are
waking up to the fact that the fundamentals for oil prices look stronger
than they have for some time. With sterling now at about Dollars 1.65, and
Brent crude at about Dollars 20.80 a barrel, the sterling oil price stands
at more than Pounds 12.60 a barrel. Moreover, with the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries agreeing at its meeting last month to freeze
output at its August level - allowing only for a small increase by Kuwait -
analysts say a tight market could push Brent crude prices to Dollars 22.
If forecasts of an unusually cold winter come true, the price could go even
higher.
The improved price has already benefited stocks with large North Sea
interests, especially Clyde - which recently formed a joint venture with
Austrian oil group OMV to undertake further exploration work - Goal, Pict
and Monument. Ranger could also benefit, although its shares have been among
the few that have largely held their value during the downturn.
Premier Consolidated Oilfields, which also has important North Sea
interests, has performed less well. Mr Charles Jamieson, Premier's chief
executive, said his company's stock is traditionally one of the more liquid
and complains that the City is not placing sufficient value on the company's
gas interests in a 3,500bn cu ft gas field in Pakistan. 'We only have 9 1/2
per cent,' he said, 'but that means 320bn cu ft of gas, which is roughly the
size of most North Sea fields these days.'
Two of the biggest winners, however, have been Enterprise and Lasmo of the
independent sector. Lasmo is strongly geared to the strength of the dollar
versus the pound. Mr Michael Pavia, finance director, has said every Pounds
1 rise in the sterling oil price adds Pounds 40m to Lasmo's cashflow.
Enterprise is also seen as highly geared to dollar strength because most of
its income is in dollars, and most of its spending in sterling. A 10 per
cent increase in the value of the dollar adds approximately Pounds 40m to
cashflow and Pounds 30m to earnings, analysts say.
Some oil stocks have also benefited from a third factor - improved US gas
prices. After falling for more than two years, US spot prices reached a
nadir of 90 cents per million British thermal units in February 1992, 33
cents below the price a year earlier. By May, however, prices had risen
above their corresponding 1991 level, and they continued to strengthen to
reach Dollars 2.60 per million Btu by the end of September - helped partly
by disruption to production caused by Hurricane Andrew.
The price has settled back to about Dollars 2.40, but analysts believe this
is supported by market fundamentals; the low prices made many companies cut
back their drilling programmes, so supply is now more balanced with demand.
This is good news for companies with exposure to the Houston or Louisiana
gas business, such as Hardy Oil, British Borneo and Aran Energy. Cairn
Energy, which has built up significant US gas interests and last week
announced a 40 per cent interest in a 150bn cu ft gas discovery offshore
Louisiana, is also likely to be a prime beneficiary. 'Every 10 cents on the
US gas price adds Dollars 700,000 (Pounds 407,000) to our cashflow,' says Mr
Bill Gammell, Cairn's chief executive.
There is, of course, no guarantee that exchange rates or oil and gas prices
will move as predicted. So, for the moment, the gains made by the oil sector
remain fragile, and it may still take a takeover bid to underpin them.
Speculation abounds that Enterprise, which has raised Dollars 280m through a
public offering of American depository shares and a further tranche of
dollar preference shares, might be considering an assets acquisition, or a
swoop on a company. Favourite among possible targets is Monument, seen as
having an attractive portfolio.
The majors, too, might consider a swoop on one of the exploration and
production companies. In spite of the pick-up in its shares, Lasmo remains a
possible target. It would be ironic if the company whose own acquisition
activity did so much to depress the market last year was itself the victim
of a takeover which went on to boost prices.

FT  20 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Expanding Volex expects sharp profits
advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIX MONTHS of search and negotiation have paid off for Volex, said Mr Howard
Poulson, chairman of the electrical interconnection products and systems
company, when he announced the acquisition of a 60 per cent stake in Mayor,
a Singapore-based manufacturer of data and power cord assemblies, for
SDollars 18m (Pounds 6.5m).
Mr Poulson said the acquisition was 'a further and important step in Volex's
strategy of becoming a global supplier of cable assemblies to the computer,
medical and instrumentation markets'.
Volex also forecast that its pre-tax profits for the six months to September
30 would be about Pounds 2.8m, a rise of 86 per cent over the Pounds 1.5m of
last time, and 'a very conservative' estimate in the view of Mr Poulson.
He said the order book was 'very strong' at Pencon, where sales had already
been boosted by expected safety legislation to make compulsory in the UK the
fitting of plugs (moulded where possible) to electrical appliances.
He added that the two data cable assemblies makers - Cable Products of
Massachusetts, acquired in January for up to Pounds 14.6m, and Icontec of
California, bought in July for up to Pounds 4.31m - 'were operating at good
activity levels'.
Mr Poulson said Mayor also had record order books, 'bursting at the seams'.
In the 33 weeks to August 22, it made pre-tax profits of SDollars 1.86m
(Pounds 690,000) on sales of SDollars 22.3m and in the year to December 31
had profits of SDollars 2.3m on sales of SDollars 22.7m. At that date net
assets were SDollars 5.2m.
The acquisition was financed mostly by a bought deal with SG Warburg
Securities - a vendor placing of 1.91m new ordinary Volex shares of 25p
each. Most were taken up by existing shareholders.

COURTS (Singapore), part of Courts, the UK home furnishing group, is making
a public share offering prior to a listing on the main board of the
Singapore stock exchange.
The offering comprises 25m shares of 20 Singapore cents at 68 cents each to
raise the equivalent of Pounds 6.3m.
Courts (Singapore) was established in 1973 and now has five furnishing and
electrical outlets in Singapore. It has established a reputation as an
aggressive seller, becoming one of the biggest local retailers of household
items.
It plans to become the first company in Singapore to use TV advertising to
publicise a flotation. The offering closes on November 3.
Mr Albert Elphick, managing director in Singapore, said it was planned to
open more stores there, increasing retail space by at least 50 per cent. He
said although the local retail industry might be facing a downturn, the
Singapore government's plans to upgrade and build new public housing should
ensure a bright future for the company.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: One fifth of EC fishing fleet
hangs in balance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than one fifth of the EC fishing fleet appears poised to be scrapped in
order to conserve sufficient fisheries stock to sustain the industry.
Community fisheries ministers yesterday decided to press for an evenly
distributed reduction of the EC fleet next month, or at the latest in
December.
Mr David Curry, the UK fisheries minister, who was chairing the meeting,
said afterwards that the 12 were broadly agreed that the fishing industry
across the EC knew that measures had to be taken.
'All the illustrative figures were over 20 per cent,' he said. He pointed
out that neither the extent nor the final distribution of the cuts had been
agreed. Senior officials of the member states start work on the reductions
today.
Mr Curry said that other measures to conserve fishing stocks would also be
examined.
Nevertheless, the level of vessel scrapping under discussion is less than
the original proposal of 40 per cent put forward in December 1990 by Mr
Manuel Marin, EC fisheries commissioner.

Europe gets to grip with price variations

THE investigation of car makers' pricing policies across Europe is set to
intensify over the next two years.
In mid-1995 the present 10-year 'block exemption', which controversially
allows car makers to use a selective dealer distribution system in
contravention of European Community competition rules, is due to expire.
The motor industry has been given due warning by the EC competition
directorate that a renewal of the block exemption will depend heavily on car
manufacturers' performance in conforming with EC limits on car price
differentials across Europe.
The block exemption granted in 1985 was conditional in part on car prices
between member states not differing by more than 12 per cent in the
long-term or by more than 18 per cent for periods of less than a year.
During 1992 both the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission and the European
Commission have published reports on car prices in Europe. Neither report
has succeeded in removing the widespread confusion over price differences,
but the EC report in particular has drawn attention to many specific cases
where price differentials have exceeded the block exemption guidelines.
This month a new report is being published by Ludvigsen Associates, the
UK-based automotive analysts, which widens the pricing debate beyond Europe
and claims that, whatever the price differences within Europe, European car
buyers are paying as much as 30 per cent more for new cars than consumers in
the US and in Japan.
Ludvigsen Associates, which carried out the basic research for the MMC
inquiry in the UK, claims that 'the European car buyer is spending more than
he should for personal transportation' both in absolute terms and in
relation to household income.
The report is the first co-ordinated attempt to compare car prices between
Europe and the other major world markets, the US and Japan.
According to the study the largest differences are with car prices in Japan.
It claims that European car prices (net of tax) are 33 to 43 per cent higher
than equivalent prices in Japan, while European prices are 15 to 45 per cent
higher than in the US.
On average it takes 27 weeks of gross family income for a European to buy a
car compared with 21 weeks in America and 15 weeks in Japan.
The UK is at the European average, while the Germans, French and Belgians
need four weeks less.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, warned car makers during
the summer that 'action is needed at once' both to monitor car prices more
closely and to reduce differentials.
The study prepared for the European Commission and published earlier this
year showed that there have been substantial price differences for some car
models across the Community of more than 40 per cent in the most extreme
cases.
According to the EC report five car makers, Ford, Honda, Citroen, Mazda and
Audi, had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per cent
in one of the five time periods selected for study between January 1988 and
January 1991.
The study's findings have come under heavy attack from the motor industry,
but in a letter to car makers Sir Leon has made clear that the industry must
take steps to make their European pricing policies more transparent if they
wish to retain the selective distribution system, which in effect restricts
sales of new cars exclusively to dealers chosen by the manufacturers.
Consumer groups, already critical of dealers and their service and repair
performance, have called for the system to be replaced by a market
free-for-all, with manufacturers being obliged to supply cars to virtually
any outlet which wishes to sell them.
At issue is the question of power and control within the motor industry, and
whether some of that power should be allowed to slip from the manufacturers
to the retailers. Is selective distribution in fact a significant factor
behind the substantial price differentials the EC claims to have found?
Sir Leon is presently on delicate legal ground with the motor industry. In
his letter to car makers last month he accepts that the EC car price study
has not established 'beyond doubt' the linkage between large car price
differences across the Community and the selective distribution system.
Ominously for the car makers he pointed out, however, that the study had
made adjustments for the other most significant potential causes of the
price differentials perceived by consumers, such as varying equipment
specification levels, currency fluctuations, tax rates and discounting.
The decision about what to do when the block exemption expires in mid-1995
would be based 'on a full evaluation of the strengths and weaknesses of the
selective distribution system as it currently operates, and not just the
price issue,' admitted Sir Leon.
He left little doubt in his letter, however, that the pricing issue will
play a vital role in the decision-making process, at least for the
competition officials.
According to Sir Leon 'the current pricing situation is a cause for
concern,' and the evolution of prices over the next three years would be 'an
important factor' in the decision on whether or not the block exemption
should survive. Action was needed 'at once'.
Given the confusion that still reigns over the results of the car makers'
pan-European pricing policies, Sir Leon is seeking three far-reaching steps
by the industry to increase price transparency. He is calling on car makers:
to publish every three months one price list on an EC-wide basis for their
entire product range. Prices should be quoted in Ecus and in local currency,
and should be set out in a way that 'will enable consumers to make clear
comparisons.'
to make freely available every three months the prices recommended to
authorised dealers for the manufacturer's five top-selling models in each
market along with comparable prices for every other EC market, (again in
Ecus and local currency).
to complete every six months an analysis of the prices recommended to
dealers in each EC member state of 'one standard, low equipment model' in
each market segment. The manufacturers are to ensure in this way that they
are operating within the price bands allowed by the block exemption
regulation.
In addition Sir Leon has asked the car makers to write to their dealers in
each market to assure them that they will supply cars ordered with
specifications for another market (for example a right-hand drive car with
UK specifications ordered in Belgium) 'within a reasonable time period' and
'at the same basic price' as for normal supplies of the comparable local
model.
The industry is still to respond to these requests, but it has some way to
go if it is to repair the credibility gap with Sir Leon and ensure the
survival beyond 1995 of selective distribution, which car makers insist is
essential to provide adequate levels of service and safety to car owners.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (5): Trickle becomes a flood -
Japanese plants are opening far and wide
</HEADLINE>

IN DECEMBER, the first car will roll off the assembly line at Toyota's
Pounds 700m car plant in the UK, as Japan's leading vehicle maker
commissions its first car production operation in Europe.
Toyota began output of engines in Europe at its Pounds 140m plant in north
Wales in September. Earlier this month Honda began volume production at its
Pounds 300m car plant in southern England.
The start-up of a wave of new plants by the Japanese auto industry heralds
the start of a new phase in the formidable assault by Japanese car makers on
the European car industry. An array of plants and new models are entering
production in the UK, Hungary, Italy and Spain.
Japanese vehicle production capacity in Europe is expected to exceed 1.2m a
year by the end of the 1990s. European car production totalled 12.7m last
year with the Volkswagen group accounting for 2.44m and Renault, the
smallest of the big six volume carmakers, for 1.55m. Japanese carmakers
captured 12.3 per cent of west European new car sales of 13.49m last year
and this is forecast to rise to between 16 and 20 per cent by 1999.
Toyota and Honda are developing a total capacity to produce 300,000 cars a
year by the mid-1990s at their UK plants, and the figure could easily double
by the end of the decade.
The UK is not the only Japanese springboard into Europe. At Esztergom, 40
kms north of Budapest, the first Suzuki Swifts are also set to leave the
line of Magyar Suzuki's more modest assembly plant during the autumn, while
in northern Italy Daihatsu is preparing to begin production by the end of
the year of micro vans at its joint venture with Piaggio.
Back in Britain Nissan, which pioneered the route for the Japanese motor
industry into local car production in Europe during the mid-1980s, is
already launching its second UK-built car range.
A new generation Micra - Nissan's small car that competes with the Ford
Fiesta, the Peugeot 205 and the Renault Clio - will be supplied to Europe
from its Pounds 900m Sunderland car plant in England.
The Toyota, Honda and Suzuki plants may start slowly, but the Nissan example
shows how fast the trickle will become a flood.
Japan's second largest auto maker began car production modestly enough in
Europe in 1986, but it is now pulling out all the stops to stay a jump ahead
of its Japanese rivals.
While it is Nissan's burgeoning UK operations that claim much of the
limelight, the company is also investing heavily in Nissan Motor Iberica,
the Spanish commercial vehicle maker, where it acquired majority control a
decade ago.
From 1990 to 1995 Nissan is investing Pounds 600m in Spain. Last month it
started European production in Barcelona of its new Serena multi-purpose
vehicle while in the spring the company will roll out a new generation
four-wheel drive vehicle.
As a sign of the changing order Nissan will supply part of its Spanish
output of the four-wheel drive vehicle to Ford for sale in Europe under the
Ford badge.
The link between Ford and Nissan in Spain shows how quickly the arrival of
the Japanese vehicle makers in Europe is set to move on to a more
sophisticated plane.
General Motors of the US (which sells under the Opel/Vauxhall badges in
Europe) is already using the technology of Isuzu, its minority-owned
Japanese affiliate, to produce four-wheel drive leisure vehicles - the
Opel/Vauxhall Frontera - at a joint venture, IBC Vehicles, in the UK.
Rapidly mounting research and development costs are the driving force behind
the new alliances. Volkswagen of Germany, the biggest European car maker,
has recently finalised a deal with Suzuki for the production of a range of
small cars in Spain.
Suzuki, already producing compact four-wheel drive vehicles in Spain and now
starting car production in Hungary, will develop the new range of minicars
with Seat, VW's Spanish subsidiary.
While VW develops its link with Suzuki, Rover, formerly British Leyland, has
become closely allied to Honda, while Volvo, the ailing Swedish car maker,
has sought refuge with Mitsubishi Motors in a joint venture in the
Netherlands to develop the next generation medium-sized car to replace the
present Volvo 440 series.
Honda, in addition to its own UK car and engine plant, holds a 20 per cent
equity stake in Rover's vehicle operations, and Honda technology has
essentially underpinned all Rover's mainstream new cars launched since the
mid-1980s.
Volvo has brought Mitsubishi in as a joint venture partner at its Dutch
plant, where a new range of cars - badged both Volvo and Mitsubishi, but
mainly engineered by the Japanese car maker - will emerge in the mid-1990s.
To date only Mazda among the leading Japanese car makers is still to
determine a strategy for starting local car production in Europe.
Even as the concrete is drying at the assembly plants, the leading Japanese
producers are also pressing ahead with the establishment of R&amp;D facilities
in Europe.
Honda is building up a technical centre near Frankfurt. Toyota's development
resources are being concentrated in Belgium. Nissan has invested Pounds 64m
to date in design and development operations in Europe including a technical
centre in the UK.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (1): The engine overheats -
World demand for cars is dropping just as large-scale investment in new
production facilities is racing ahead in many countries. These twin factors
are creating a business climate of particular harshness

WORLD car makers are facing weakening demand in western Europe and Japan,
while the US car market is pulling only hesitantly out of recession.
The big three US car makers are reducing the record losses of 1991, but the
struggle back into profit is painfully slow.
For the first time the Japanese motor industry is also under pressure as its
seemingly inexorable expansion comes up against the limits of retrenchment
in its domestic market and jarring trade frictions abroad.
In Europe falling sales, looming overcapacity and turmoil in the financial
markets paint an ominous background as the car industry is poised to enter
the era of the single market from the beginning of 1993, with the gradual
dismantling of restrictions on Japanese vehicle imports.
In Japan several of the smaller auto makers including Isuzu, Daihatsu and
Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru) are in loss, while Nissan, Japan's second
largest car maker, is expecting its first loss this year since 1946 and is
omitting its interim dividend. The net profits of Toyota, the leader of the
Japanese industry, fell by 45 per cent in the financial year to the end of
June.
The Japanese motor industry 'may now be at a structural crossroads,' Mr
Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan, warned earlier this month. 'The global
motor industry is facing a business climate of unprecedented severity.'
New car demand in Japan in 1992 is falling for a second year in succession,
the first time for many years that there has been such a prolonged period of
decline.
The fall of 4.6 per cent in 1991 and a forecast decline of 6 per cent this
year follow a period of extraordinary growth in the late 1980s, when the
Japanese new car market climbed from 3.28m in 1987 to 5.1m in 1990.
With no more access to cheap capital and with sharply rising labour costs,
the Japanese car makers are having to cut costs, actions which could bring
much-needed relief - at least in the short-term - to their hard-pressed
rivals in the US and in Europe.
The seemingly inexorable flood of new products from Japan may slow, as for
the first time Japanese car makers move to extend model life cycles  - in
many cases from four to five or six years - and act to reduce the
proliferation of model variants.
Japan, the world's biggest automobile producer, emerged for the first time
last year with the highest gross hourly wage rates in the world auto
industry according to a study by the German motor industry federation.
In North America, where the big three - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler -
are seeking to climb back from last year's record losses, the going remains
tough.
Ford, the second largest US producer, warned earlier this month that slow
sales in the US and in Europe are expected to push it back into loss during
the third quarter.
General Motors, the wounded leader of the world motor industry, still faces
an onerous task to restructure its chronically loss-making North American
operations.
As GM tries desperately to shrink its North American operations it has
announced the closure of 21 plants - six vehicle assembly plants, four
engine and transmission plants and 11 components plants - and a 74,000
reduction in its workforce by the mid-1990s.
GM has already turned the screw drastically on its outside components
suppliers in its attempts to cuts costs, but with one of the highest levels
of in-house component manufacturing in the world auto industry, the battle
remains to be fought inside the corporation.
In the struggle to lose its status as the high-cost producer in North
America GM could still be heading ominously for a climactic show-down with
the United Auto Workers union. The UAW said earlier this year that it
intended 'to enforce vigorously' its labour contract with GM, which
virtually guarantees continued pay to laid-off workers.
The unfolding drama at GM will influence the development of the worldwide
auto industry, which it still bestrides accounting for around 15 per cent of
world vehicle output.
The severity of the problems that have confronted the US auto industry have
intensified protectionist pressures and the big three US car makers are
showing unusual unity as they enlist Washington in their battle against the
encroachment of the Japanese car makers.
The US initiative has brought fresh promises from the Japanese motor
industry to buy more US components both for use in Japan and in the Japanese
car plants in North America, but the concessions will scarcely dent the
chronic US automotive trade deficit with Japan. Within North America the US
administration has tried to use customs regulations on local content to
force Japanese vehicle makers to use more locally-produced components while
a barrage of protective trade legislation has been proposed in Congress.
The automotive sections of the North America Free Trade Agreement signed
earlier this year between the US, Canada and Mexico also appear to be
designed to raise the competitive hurdles confronting the Japanese car
makers in the US.
Japanese producers accounted for 25 per cent of total US car production last
year, increasing their share from 22 per cent a year earlier. The Japanese
transplants' total car and light truck production capacity in North America
is planned to reach around 2.7m vehicles a year by 1993/94.
The development of the Japanese production base in North America is now
almost complete, however, and the central focus of the battle in the global
auto industry has shifted to Europe. In a period of less than 12 months from
the summer of 1992 an array of Japanese manufacturing plants and new models
are entering production in the UK, Hungary, and Spain.
The Japanese car makers' main springboard into Europe is the UK, described
by Mr Jacques Calvet, the staunchly protectionist chief executive of
Peugeot, the French car maker, as 'a Japanese aircraft carrier just off the
coast of Europe'.
The indigenous European producers are also busy building new capacity - car
makers led by Volkswagen, Fiat and GM are bringing into production in Europe
plants with a capacity for around 1.5m vehicles a year between mid-1992 and
the end of 1994.
The next wave of plants is about to hit the market, however, as the European
appetite for buying new cars is succumbing to economic recession.
Leading western car makers have intensified warnings in recent weeks that
west European new car sales would fall in 1993 for the second successive
year.
The challenges facing car makers in Europe have been heightened by the
massive upheaval in the currency markets.
The uncertain economic outlook is a depressing background to the dawning of
the era of the single market in Europe, which marks a watershed for the car
industry.
From the start of 1993 the existing bilateral restrictions on direct
Japanese vehicle exports to France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the UK are
supposed to be replaced by a controversial system of monitoring by Brussels
and Tokyo, in the first move to a completely liberalised EC car market by
the end of 1999.
The rules for monitoring Japanese vehicle exports to the EC appeared to be
shaky even in a period of growth, but severe frictions could now develop
between Europe and Japan, if the system must be administered in a period of
falling sales.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (9): Just in the nick of time -
French dash to match imports challenge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S three car makers, Peugeot, Citroen and state-owned Renault, have
made big strides in productivity as they prepare to face the Japanese
challenge in a liberalised European Community market.
They have done so in the nick of time. For France's bilateral import quota
on Japanese cars, which has limited their penetration to around 3 per cent
of the domestic market for years, is due to go by the end of this year.
Already, the Japanese share of the French car market has been allowed to
creep up in anticipation, from 3.3 per cent of new registrations in 1990 to
4.1 per cent last year, according to the Comite des Constructeurs Francais
d'Automobiles. By 1998, Japanese imports to France could rise from last
year's 82,440 vehicles to around 317,000, or 11.1 per cent of the market,
according to the European Commission.
The French government appears resigned to opening the floodgates, made
inevitable by the 1990 EC-Japan car import agreement, under which the
Community market is to be fully liberalised over a seven-year transition
period to the end of 1999. Mr Jacques Calvet, the chairman of Peugeot, has
condemned the deal as an example of how Europe has 'unilaterally disarmed
without anything in exchange'.
Yet despite Mr Calvet's complaints, incidentally not echoed by his
counterparts at Renault, the government is preparing for a controlled
arrival of Japanese competition. One sign of this is its readiness to allow
Nissan to buy out its French dealership earlier this year, ending 10 years
of resistance to the deal.
Other Japanese producers are on the move. Fuji Heavy Industries was planning
to export Legacy saloons and estate cars to France at the end of September
and expects authorisation soon to import Subaru cars. Subaru France hopes to
sell 1,000 Fuji cars in the year to March 1993 from 25 new outlets. In June,
Suzuki made its first French export sales, though on a very small scale,
while Daihatsu is studying the possibility of exporting its Charade models
to France.
Only 10 years ago it was unthinkable that Peugeot and Renault could face
Japanese competition head-on. They were both on the brink of bankruptcy at
the time. Today, they have come through the recession leaner and more
efficient and made big improvements in quality.
Last year, for example, the Peugeot group, which includes Citroen, maintains
it produced the highest net margins of any car maker in the world, even
after having suffered a 40 per cent decline in net earnings. Renault,
reported well over doubled net profits last year, followed by a five-fold
rise in earnings in the first half of 1992 and is proceeding so successfully
with its alliance with Volvo that both partners talk of a possible merger.
Their payroll costs have fallen dramatically. Renault has cut its workforce
by 25 per cent over the past five years, while Peugeot, less overmannned
than its public sector rival, has managed a 5 per cent reduction over the
same period. The two groups have also successfully introduced just in time
stock control, Japanese style production teams in place of the old line
management system, reorganised their design departments, and modernised most
of their product ranges.
Peugeot reckons to have improved the number of cars made per man by 50 per
cent over the past five years, while Renault says it has improved its
productivity by 6 per cent to 7 per cent per year over the same period. Both
aim at least to repeat that improvement by the end of the decade.
Tighter stock control has saved financial charges for both of them. Yet the
extent to which just in time stock control depends on Japanese style labour
stability was sharply underlined by a strike at Renault's main engine and
gearbox plant last year, which took only 10 days to halt the group's entire
French and Belgian car production, starved of vital components.
The progress has come in the following main areas, where the French industry
has not hesitated to adapt techniques from the Japanese competition.
Quality control. Peugeot has abandoned the old style of quality control,
whereby faults are identified and corrected in an enormous car park at the
end of the production line. Now the lines are divided into sections, each
managed by an autonomous team, responsible for correcting its own faults as
the vehicle moves through. As a result, Peugeot has over the past five years
closed all its refinishing shops. Renault is moving over to the same system
and aims to close all its refinishing departments within four years.
Components. Renault and Peugeot are getting less integrated and becoming
primarily designers and assemblers. This is another way of cutting costs to
the bone, but also reflects the fact that neither wants to get involved in
the increasing electronic and specialised components found in modern cars.
As a result, the proportion of bought-in components has risen steeply in
recent years to just over 60 per cent of operating total costs at Peugeot
and 67 per cent at Renault. At the same time, they have set rigorous quality
controls on suppliers. Peugeot and Renault have for the past five years been
running joint audits on component suppliers' quality, and are thinking of
extending this system to cover suppliers' productivity and costs. Renault
has also achieved substantial cost savings by pooling much of its component
buying activities with Volvo.
Design management. Another part of the race to catch up with Japan is the
time and investment needed to design and launch new cars. Here Peugeot
estimates that the Japanese still have a substantial advantage, capable of
launching a new model for around FFr3-4bn in three years, as against the
French average of FFr6bn to FFr8bn in four to five years. These comparisons
are, of course, rough, since there is no standard measure for the starting
point of a new design.
The time taken to design and launch Renault's latest small car, the Twingo,
was in line with Japanese experience, says Mr Philippe Gras, deputy chief
executive. On average, Renault aims to produce a new model in just under
four years, down from the nearly five years that used to be the norm.
Peugeot last year placed the design teams of its two sister companies under
a single management to help them work faster and expects to produce the
first concrete results from 1994.
Even so, Renault and Peugeot have some way to go before they can meet
Japanese standards of productivity. The result of all these efforts is to
bring the French car industry's productivity to just 10 per cent behind that
of Japanese car producers in Britain, itself 10 per cent behind the Japanese
in Japan, according to a study by consultants McKinsey for the European
Commission.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (11): Green shoots in
communism's ruins - Eastern Europe's low-paid labour force attracts western
investment
</HEADLINE>

   By ANTHONY ROBINSON

<TEXT>
EASTERN EUROPE has emerged as a crucial new element in the struggle by
European and US car-makers to reduce their costs and increase market share
in their global struggle with the Japanese producers.
Volkswagen and Fiat, Ford and General Motors have spearheaded the move into
Eastern Europe with substantial investment in new assembly plants and
component factories in former east Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland.
Among a plethora of smaller-scale licensing and production pacts Renault and
Citroen of France are discussing the upgrading of long-standing licensing
assembly operations in Romania. Rover group, the UK car manufacturer, is
involved in a joint venture with the Bulgarian defence ministry to assemble
cars, as well as Landrovers and pick-up trucks, at former military factories
in that country.
The Japanese carmakers have so far shown their habitual caution before
investing in largely uncharted areas, although they have been actively
boosting sales of cars from their UK and other plants into Poland and other
new markets.
Suzuki has been the first Japanese producer to take the plunge, building an
assembly plant to make 60,000 Swift models a year at a new plant at
Esztergom in Hungary. The Suzuki plant, built on the site of a former Soviet
military base, is building up production from components imported mainly
from Japan. But it plans to export most of its output to European Community
markets so its viability depends heavily on Suzuki's ability to switch from
expensive imported components to at least 60 per cent local content by 1995.
The caution of the Japanese has been partially justified by events. The
transition to a market economy is proving a complex, bruising process
accompanied by a sharp fall in industrial production and a steep decline in
real incomes for large sections of the population. At the same time,
however, income gaps have widened.
Societies formerly marked by a large measure of egalitarianism at a low
level of income have seen rising unemployment and the pauperisation of large
sections of the industrial working class. It will be a long time before most
of these people will be able to afford a car, especially a new car.
At the same time, however, the last three years have seen the emergence of a
small, but rapidly growing class of wealthy, or relatively wealthy
individuals. This is reflected in rapid growth, albeit from a minuscule
base, in the sales of luxury cars, especially Mercedes and BMWs. But the
rapid growth of the private sector, especially in Poland but on a rising
scale throughout the area, has created a strong demand for imported new and
second hand cars.
Poland alone imported nearly 400,000 western vehicles last year, of which
60,000 were new. Czechoslovakia and Hungary showed a similar pattern as
those with hard currency savings - senior employees of newly set up
foreign-owned companies and local entrepreneurs - rushed to satisfy their
pent up desire for a western car.
This demand helped to fuel last year's booming European car market, both
directly and by underpinning used-car prices. But it will clearly take much
longer than originally expected before the markets of eastern Europe, and
especially the markets in Russia and the other former Soviet republics, live
up to their long term potential as mass markets.
This means that manufacturers are down-grading their expectations of
domestic sales from their new plants and placing greater emphasis on the
hoped for lower costs of production of vehicles and components destined for
European Community markets.
This is specially true of Fiat which decided to source Europe-wide sales of
the new Cinquecento model from the FSM plant in southern Poland where it
plans to spend another Dollars 850m over the next few years.
Low wage costs of around 10 per cent of German levels for assembly line
workers were a major attraction to new investors. The prospect of lower
costs was behind Fiat's plan, for example, to take 90 per cent control of
FSM and make the new Cinquecento mini-car in Poland as part of a Dollars 2bn
long term investment project.
The aim is to build up Cinquecento output to 240,000 a year and introduce a
new model at the nearby Biasko Biala plant. But this strategy began to look
decidely risky when unofficial unionists staged a seven week sit-in strike
to press for wages more in line with ltalian workers at similar plants in
Italy.
Thanks largely to the Polish government's tougher policy on labour disputes
the strike ended in mid-September on terms originally agreed between Fiat
and the official unions. This provided for a 30 per cent rise in wage rates
but fell far short of the strikers' demands for wages equivalent to 10 per
cent of the retail price of the Cinquecento.
Nevertheless the strike lost output of 15,000 vehicles, wrecked Fiat's
expensive advertising campaign, and allowed Subaru to sneak into Fiat's
crucial home market by selling 6,000 of its own mini-cars while Fiat looked
on helplessly.
Volkswagen, meanwhile, is building a new plant at Mosel in the Saxon region
of former east Germany to produce 250,000 Golf cars a year while hoping to
repeat in Czechoslovakia its successful re-vamp of Seat in Spain. The German
company, whose initial 30 per cent stake in Skoda Automobila, the Skoda-VW
joint venture, will rise to 70 per cent by the middle of the decade, is busy
raising a Dollars 1.2bn syndicated loan.
This will finance the start of a DM8bn investment programme which will raise
capacity from the present 200,000 to 460,000 by mid-decade, and
progressively introduce new models alongside the existing Skoda cars. VW is
also assembling up to 30,000 Audi models a year at Bratislava, the Slovak
capital.
Volkswagen, General Motors and Fiat have been in the forefront of moves by
the major western manufacturers to secure tariff protection for the the
products of their new eastern plants. The battle has been particularly
strong in Poland where VW plans to assemble vans and GM, whose main
investment in Central Europe is its Dollars 300m engine and Astra assembly
plants at Szentgotthard in Hungary, has just produced a modified plan to
assemble 35,000 Astra cars a year in a Dollars 75m investment at the FSO
plant in Warsaw.
On top of the 30 per cent tariff on imported cars the 'big three' are also
pressing for a 30,000 tariff free import quota to be divided among
themselves - to howls of protest from other importers like Peugeot. The
automobile industry in Eastern and Central Europe has come a long way in
three years, but not quite along the route originally imagined.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (12): Long night's journey into
day - US giants are beginning painfully to claw back their home market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
THE US motor industry is emerging with painful slowness from a severe
recession and heavy financial losses, but it is getting in much better shape
to fight the never-ending battle against Japanese competition.
The Big Three manufacturers - General Motors, Ford Motor and Chrysler - have
collectively lost billions of dollars over the past two years.
This was due to plummeting demand in North America at a time when an
expansion of Japanese manufacturing capacity in the US - the so-called
'transplant' operations - was adding to the industry's chronic imbalance
between potential supply and demand. The result was a fierce price-cutting
war.
Yet the recession has at least forced the Big Three to become much leaner in
their day-to-day operations. Ford and Chrysler, having suffered financial
crises in the early 1980s, had less slimming to do than General Motors,
which had been shielded for years by its huge market share, a buoyant car
market and its large non-automotive subsidiaries.
Yet even GM, which as a group lost Dollars 4.5bn last year, has finally been
forced to bite the bullet. It announced sweeping factory closures last
December, while in April a coup by board members gave added urgency to the
revitalisation programme.
Mr Jack Smith, who in the 1980s played a major role in turning around GM
Europe from losses to profit, was appointed the group's president with a
mandate to speed up change in North America.
One of his most striking moves has been to appoint a new Spanish head of
GM's parts purchasing operation, who is seeking controversial price cuts
from suppliers while at the same time trying to forge closer, long-term
relations with them, in a manner reminiscent of Japanese automobile
companies.
Indeed, across the board a striking feature of all the Big Three companies
is how much they have learnt from their Japanese rivals.
Mr David Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive
Transportation at the University of Michigan, says: 'the domestic
manufacturers are really getting religion fast and are becoming much more
viable competitors. I have a higher level of confidence about their long
term success than I would have had a couple of years ago.'
Chrysler, for example, has totally remodelled the way it does business after
closely studying Honda. It has forged close links with suppliers, who are
brought in to discussions early in the development of a new car, and created
new platform teams, responsible for development of various types of vehicle,
which brought together members of different disciplines.
Parts of General Motors have also learnt lessons from the Japanese.
Cadillac, the luxury car manufacturer, studied the methods of Dr Edward
Deming, the academic behind much of the Japanese management philosophy, and
won an important US quality award.
And Saturn, the small car project General Motors launched in the 1980s as a
stand-alone attempt to exceed Japanese methods of sophisticated
manufacturing, has produced a vehicle which is one of the hottest on the US
market. Embarrassingly for GM, it is also in extremely short supply.
The quality of US cars is also much improved, although still a little behind
that of Japanese rivals. According to the latest Initial Quality Study from
the consultancy JD Powers, the average Japanese make had 105 problems per
100 cars in the 1992 model year, down from 112. The Big Three score was 136,
down from 148.
Still, analysts say these headline figures mask a wide range of variation
among products and manufacturers, and that not all Japanese products are in
the top rank.
The improved quality image of US vehicles may be one factor why the
Americans have been clawing back market share from the Japanese. In the
first six months of this year Japanese cars accounted for 29.1 per cent of
the US market, down from 29.6 per cent in the same period of 1991. When cars
made in Japanese plants, but sold by US companies, are included in the
tally, the Japanese share dipped from 36 per cent to 34.4 per cent.
Another factor may have been the lower rate of price increases pushed
through by the Big Three compared with their Japanese rivals, whose parent
companies are now suffering from Japan's slowdown.
Detroit, in other words, no longer sees its Japanese rivals as invulnerable.
Many view this year's market share gains as a temporary breathing space,
although Mr Robert Lutz, president of Chrysler, has predicted that the Big
Three will take one to three percentage points of car and truck market share
back from the Japanese each year through to the mid-1990s.
Whatever happens, the vehicle market does seem to be recovering, with
overall US car and truck sales up 5 per cent in the first six months of this
year. For 1993 analysts are forecasting sales of around 14.5m vehicles, up
from a little over 13m in the current year.
That, in turn, should restore the Big Three to the black and give them
greater financial security as they fund development of new models for the
next five years.
However, some major and potentially worrying unknowns still hang over the
industry as regards Government policy in areas such as tighter controls over
automobile emissions and greater fuel economy. In the medium term future of
the industry, says Mr Cole, 'the wild card is the Government-industry
relationship and the policy agenda that emerges'.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Pain of going for broke -
The soaring rate of business failures is forcing more and more people into
personal bankruptcy. Charles Batchelor offers a guide for survival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Paul Peccioli's fitted kitchen and bedroom business survived for two years
before it succumbed to rising interest rates. For the final six months,
Peccioli clung on hoping that things would improve, but with no prospects of
an upturn he decided to declare himself bankrupt.
On June 15 he paid his Pounds 150 fee - the authorities only accept cash -
and was officially made bankrupt by Northamptonshire County Court with debts
of more than Pounds 77,000.
'They ask you if you know what you are doing,' Peccioli recalls. 'Then there
are lots of papers to fill in. They cut up my plastic, froze my building
society account which had Pounds 41 in it, and notified all my creditors. I
never even saw a judge. A young lady came out with the seal of approval on
my petition.'
The staff from the insolvency service (part of the Department of Trade and
Industry) were helpful, Peccioli says. 'They don't treat you as the scum of
the earth. But I felt unclean. There is a stigma to knowing you are
bankrupt.'
Peccioli is attempting to start again but the insolvency rules prevent him
from obtaining more than Pounds 250 of credit without declaring that he is
an undischarged bankrupt. In practice he has been unable to open a bank
account so he has to ask customers to pay cash. He is also obliged to use
the trading name - Options - which he used before he went bankrupt.
Soaring business failure rates have meant that a growing number of people
have found themselves forced into personal bankruptcy. Businessmen and women
who operate as sole traders, or as partnerships, do not enjoy the protection
of limited liability while many company directors give personal guarantees
which override their limited liability status.
The spectacular collapses of large businesses such as Polly Peck, Coloroll
and Maxwell Communication have captured the headlines but business-related
personal bankruptcies are far more common. No fewer than two-thirds of the
46,000 business failures in the first nine months of 1992 were bankruptcies
of individuals acting as sole traders or in partnerships, according to Dun &amp;
Bradstreet, a business information group.
Behind the statistics there are many personal tragedies. Ray Neale
re-established himself in business despite the failure of his Portslade,
Sussex-based steel fabrication company two years ago, but he knows of two
other local businessmen who killed themselves after their businesses went
bust.
'Matrimonial and financial collapse often go together,' notes Shirley
Jackson, a partner in London-based insolvency specialists, Begbie Norton.
'The whole thing can lead to clinical depression.'
'It is absolutely appalling what is happening to people,' says John McQueen,
founder of The Bankruptcy Association, which provides advice on how to cope
with financial disaster. 'We are so angry about the state that people are
reduced to. They are treated like dirt.'
Not surprisingly, accountants who specialise in insolvency work take a more
detached view. The Insolvency Act of 1986 introduced a far more sensitive
and liberal treatment of bankrupts than the previous legislation which dated
from 1914, says Jackson.
'Now you can keep people with a half-way decent standard of living,' she
says. Previously bankrupts could only keep their bedding and the clothes
they stood up in but they would now be allowed to run a small car, keep
their computer if they needed it for their business and hang on to basic
audio and video equipment.
'The present insolvency regime is about how you share the misery,' says
Steve Hill, a partner at Cork Gully, the insolvency arm of accountants
Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'It attempts to achieve a balance between the interests
of the debtor and creditor.'
Until 1976, Hill notes, bankruptcy was for life unless the bankrupt applied
for a discharge and this was likely to be contested by the Official
Receiver. The system was then changed to allow a review after five years,
while in 1986 the Insolvency Act allowed an automatic discharge after three
years for most bankrupts. If the bankrupt has declared himself bankrupt and
owes less than Pounds 20,000, he is discharged after just two years.
The 1986 Act also introduced the 'individual voluntary arrangement', under
which the business owner in difficulties can come to an agreement with his
creditors to pay them off over time. These arrangements avoid the stigma and
the blot on the individual's credit rating which result from bankruptcy but
they do involve a considerable commitment. Many people find bankruptcy less
of a strain.
Hill believes the British insolvency rules strike a fair balance and
compares them with the US, where bankruptcy is common and has lost much of
its stigma, and much of continental Europe where it lasts for life or until
the bankrupt has paid off his debts.
Some observers of the 'enterprise revolution' of the 1980s think that
failure should be seen as a learning experience and not as a bar to starting
up in business again. However, Hill and many other insolvency practitioners
believe some stigma must remain to deter the unscrupulous. Clearly there are
crooks who attempt to abuse the system but growing numbers of people are
being made bankrupt for reasons beyond their own control.
Many of the businesses which are now going under have not been managed
recklessly, says David Swaden, a partner in insolvency specialists, Leonard
Curtis. 'We are down to bedrock, family businesses which have used up their
reserves and their energy fighting the recession.'
Michael Long ran a village shop in Suffolk until the recession, high
interest charges and the cost of business rates forced him to close. Long,
who is now unemployed, opted for voluntary bankruptcy and moved away from
the village to make a fresh start.
Like many other small business owners facing bankruptcy, Long says he did
not know where to turn for help. When Long's local paper carried a story
about him, calls flooded in and he decided to set up a free advice service
called the B-Line for those facing bankruptcy. Long says he has had
enquiries from more than 2,000 people in the first year of operation.
John McQueen, who set up The Bankruptcy Association in 1983 after seeing how
his brother was affected by the failure of his building business, has more
than 2,400 members and handles several hundred calls a month. Most people
join for a short time while they sort out their problems but several hundred
have remained members for many years, he says.
With no sign of an end to the recession, the numbers of business-related
bankruptcies are set to climb further. However accommodating the law sets
out to be, the experience will remain a harrowing one for many people.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Inventive managers on
course for disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Most businesses face a crisis which threatens their survival at some stage
in their life but small, high-technology companies, are particularly
vulnerable, writes Charles Batchelor.
High-technology businesses often face strains because they are growing
quickly while they operate in unstable or rapidly changing markets with new
and untried products.
They face similar problems to non-tech businesses but, unlike those
businesses, succumb more rapidly when difficulties arise.
The vulnerability of high-tech companies and the management approaches
required to increase the chances of success are the main themes of Gambling
on Growth: How to Manage the Small High-Tech Firm, by Stuart Slatter.
A survey of small, high-tech companies showed the most common causes of
crises were weak general management, poor financial controls, product
competition and problems in diversifying and making acquisitions.
Most of the problems of weak general management arose because the founder of
the company was a master of technical detail but lacked general management
skills or because he was unable to manage growth.
Financial controls were most commonly poor in the areas of cash flow
forecasting, costing and budgeting.
Often, company information systems focused on matters which were wrongly
assumed to be important to the success of the business.
In a fast growing company, control systems need constant revision, writes
Slatter, an associate professor at London Business School.
Small, high-tech businesses compete on the basis of their product technology
but they are not usually able to defend their technology by means of
patents. The product life cycle may be shorter than it takes to obtain a
patent; the time and costs involved may be too high for a small firm; and
large competitors can often find a way round a patent.
Diversification is often used by a company to reduce its dependence on a
single successful product but it can lead to a loss of focus. Acquisitions
can be dangerous because one ill-conceived deal can bring a small company to
the point of insolvency.

under way
</HEADLINE>

Local business partnerships will be invited to bid for government funds to
set up 'one-stop shops' - new advice centres planned to help businesses gain
ready access to information.
The government expects to put 15 of the shops on offer in the first stage of
a programme intended to create a national network of 200.
'Towns can bid for finance. If we get the first ones right, there will be
such pressure that private and public sectors will co-operate to extend the
concept,' Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, told the
annual conference of the Small Business Bureau, a Conservative party small
business pressure group, last week.
The government expects to complete its blueprint for the network within the
next few weeks.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (13): Imports subdue old
rivalries - America's Big Three offer each other a helping finger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RENAULT ESPACE mini-van, waiting to be taken apart in a Detroit workshop,
is about to write a small but significant chapter in US motor industry
history.
The van will be the first to undergo a 'tear-down' - taking apart a vehicle
for competitive analysis - by a joint engineering team involving all the Big
Three Detroit manufacturers - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler.
The trio has decided to save the money each would normally spend to buy and
deconstruct foreign rivals' vehicles by pooling their efforts.
It is a prime example of an unprecedented wave of cooperation among the Big
Three, ranging from research spending to political lobbying, as they battle
against Japanese manufacturers for competitive edge and market share.
In the political arena, the three consult closely on issues such as trade -
they filed a joint anti-dumping suit last year against Japanese mini-van
manufacturers - and on motor industry regulations, such as exhaust emission
controls.
As Mr Lee Iacocca, the chairman of Chrysler, said in a recent interview :
'We're in consortia: we have continual discussions on health care costs, on
regulation, on trade matters ..three groups we set up a year and a half ago.
We said: 'Hey, guys, we may have differences but we can't tell the
government we've got three different stories - that doesn't work in any
negotiation.''
However, it is in the area of research and development that some of the most
remarkable cooperation is now taking place. The Big Three have pooled their
resources in research in nine different areas over the past four years.
Until recently this would have been impossible, partly because of rivalry
between the three but mainly because the US Government, pursuing a stern
anti-trust policy, ruled out cooperation.
Back in the late 1960s the Justice Department slapped a ban on an attempted
collaboration by the trio to lower exhaust emissions. The officials feared
the motor companies would try to stymie any breakthroughs in the field and
delay the introduction of emission controls.
However, Government attitudes changed in the 1980s as the US found its
manufacturing industries losing ground in the battle against Japanese
competition, which benefited from strong Government support and corporate
cooperation. The result was the 1984 National Cooperative Research Act,
which allowed US industry as a whole some exemption from anti-trust
provisions for research work in so-called 'pre competitive' technology
fields.
Just what constitutes pre-competitive activity is something of a grey area,
but it broadly means anything that comes before a manufacturer seeks to
incorporate a R&amp;D breakthrough in one of his products.
The automobile industry's first joint project came in 1988 when GM, Ford and
Chrysler formed a consortium to study the use of polymer composites for
structural vehicle parts.
Others set up since then include three in the field of vehicle emissions:
one, carried out in conjunction with the oil industry, looks at ways of
improving air quality; another looks for new accurate instrumentation to
measure low level emissions; and a third tries to accelerate the development
of new emission control technology.
Another important consortium, formed early last year, is trying to develop
advanced batteries which might give much more power and range to electric
vehicles.
So many joint ventures are under way that last summer the three companies
set up a special umbrella organisation, called the United States Council for
Automotive Research (USCAR) to coordinate and monitor the efforts.
The executive director of USCAR is Mr Don Walkowicz, formerly GM's manager
of technical staffs and business planning, who is on secondment to the
umbrella group for two years.
He says the opportunities for new consortia 'are endless ..the task and the
challenge we have is to figure out what is the greatest opportunity to get
some synergistic effect out of pooling all the three groups together.
'We don't agree to work on something cooperatively unless it's a technology
that all three companies agree has promise - and the three companies are
still very competitive when it comes to the final product.'
He also points out that a new R&amp;D challenge for the industry - both the
consortia and individual auto companies - is to tap in to the huge pool of
expertise available in US Government research labs. These used to be
preoccupied with military applications but now, with the collapse of the
Soviet empire, they are being encouraging to cooperate more with civilian
businesses for the greater good of the US.
Certainly, the auto industry consortia are unashamedly designed to boost the
US manufacturers relative to their foreign rivals. A Japanese company which
made overtures about joining the advanced battery project was turned down.
Mr Walkowicz says USCAR's attitude toward foreign, particularly Japanese
involvement is:
'We're looking at a globally, technologically competitive situation. The
Japanese manufacturers have traditionally had this Government-industry
partnership and what we're trying to do is catch up with them ..our goal is
to make US auto manufacturers better than their global competitors.'
One of the greatest problems in getting consortia running has been the
culture of non-cooperation, deeply ingrained in engineers' minds by the
anti-trust suit of the 1960s.
This was particularly so this year when the three came to set up the
consortium on emissions technology - the very area banned by the Justice
Department more than 20 years before.
'We will be feeling our way into this venture, since we have all grown
accustomed to tackling the emissions problem separately,' said Mr John
McTague, Ford vice president for technical affairs. 'But the challenges that
lie ahead are so great that we cannot afford to stay this course.'

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (14): Birth of a trade block -
The meaning of NAFTA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE initials NAFTA represent a significant diplomatic victory for the US
automobile assembly and parts industry in its long-running battle for market
share in the North American market against Japanese competition.
For the North American Free Trade Agreement, which was clinched in August
after months of negotiations, will force Japanese manufacturers to increase
the local content of vehicles they sell in the US market and give their
American rivals an advantage in the fast-growing Mexican market.
The agreement also promises to end much of the current statistical
controversy between the US and Japanese industries over precisely what
constitutes 'local content' in a North American vehicle.
The Nafta agreement, which has yet to be ratified by the legislatures of the
three countries involved, will create a free-trade area of 360m people in
Canada, the US and Mexico. Thousands of tariffs, duties and non-tariff
barriers will be eliminated over the next decade and a half. The agreement
will supersede an existing free-trade agreement between the US and Canada.
Trade in automobiles and automobile parts constitutes one of the most
important elements of the agreement and focuses on two main areas.
First, existing Mexican rules which specify that any cars sold in that
country must have a 36 per cent local content will be relaxed to 29 per cent
over a 10 year period.
Second, vehicles built in any of the countries but sold in one of the other
two will require a 62.5 per cent content of North American parts to avoid
duty. This will be phased in over eight years.
For the first four years, the local content requirement will be 50 per cent
 -the same as it is now under the US-Canadian pact. And it will then be held
at 56 per cent for another four years.
The major winners from the pact appear to be:
the US and Canadian assembly plants of the Big Three US manufacturers, which
are expecting a sharp boost to sales from a newly opened Mexican market.
Demand for cars is growing rapidly in Mexico as the country's economy booms.
US automotive parts companies, which see an opportunity both to sell more
parts into the Mexican market and to so-called Japanese transplants -
Japanese car plants in the US and Canada - which need to boost their local
content.
the Mexican automobile industry. Less efficient parts of the industry -
essentially manufacturers of big cars - are likely to suffer from more
efficient American competition. But this seems likely to be offset
eventually by increased production in Mexico by the Big Three of small
vehicles to serve the entire North American market. Cheap Mexican
manufacturing costs could help the Big Three claw back parts of the small
car market which have been lost over the past decade to offshore Asian
competition.
The main losers look like being:
the US United Auto Workers' Union, which fears the Big Three will shift jobs
from the US to Mexico, where labour costs are far below those of the US and
environmental regulations relatively relaxed. 'This deal in its present form
will vaporise thousands and thousands more good-paying American jobs,'
according to Mr Owen Bieber, the UAW's president.
However, there is such overcapacity in the US market that no-one expects a
rush by the Big Three to locate south of the border and many analysts argue
that the UAW would lose these small car jobs anyway to Asian competition.
Far better, runs the argument, to lose them to Mexicans in the same trading
bloc, thus creating wealth which may then be spent on more luxurious cars
built in the US.
Japanese manufacturers, who immediately branded the pact a 'giant step in
the wrong direction'. The Japanese had been pressing for the domestic
content rules to stay at the present 50 per cent.
The Japanese will be at a disadvantage relative to the Big Three because
their local content is generally less than their North American rivals now,
and because the Big Three have a much larger existing manufacturing base in
Mexico, which under Nafta they will be able to include for domestic content
purposes.
Of the Japanese, only Nissan currently builds vehicles in Mexico, making
some 142,000 units a year, compared with 192,000 for General Motors, 220,000
for Ford and 194,000 for Chrysler.
The Japanese will therefore have to increase their North American content
significantly, which they complain will mean expensive retooling.
It remains unclear just how much this will benefit US-owned parts
manufacturing companies. The reason is that 350 to 400 Japanese parts
companies already have manufacturing operations in the US and the Japanese
assemblers, with eight transitional years until the new content rules come
fully into effect, seem certain to continue relying heavily on their
compatriots.
That said, the Japanese assemblers are under strong political pressure to
buy more parts from manufacturers located in the US, be they US or Japanese
owned.
Last January, President Bush made a controversial visit to Japan,
accompanied by the chairmen of the Big Three, to pressure the Japanese to
buy more from the US and thus reduce the huge Japanese surplus on auto trade
with the US. The Japanese agreed to increase purchases of US parts from
Dollars 10bn in 1991 to Dollars 19bn in 1994. Most of this is expected to go
into cars built in America for the local market, rather than being US parts
exports to Japan.
However, precisely what constitutes 'local content' is currently far from
clear - a situation highlighted by the case of Honda Civics built in Canada
and sold in the US. According to Honda, these contain 69 per cent North
American parts, and should thus qualify for duty free entry to the US under
the 50 per cent rule.
The US customs service contends they only have a 46 per cent North American
content. A key reason for the ruling was that Honda engines which go into
the Civics, and which are made in the US, were deemed not to be American
because they contained less than 50 per cent local content. Under the
customs rules, they were therefore 'rolled down' to count as zero local
content. If they contained over 50 per cent, they would be 'rolled up' to be
100 per cent locally manufactured.
Nafta promises to inject more rationality into the system. It will do away
with 'roll up' and 'roll down' and instead trace individual parts back to
their point of origin to establish just how truly North American they are.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (20): Facing the truth /
Profile of Yoshifumi Tsuji, Nissan's president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR YOSHIFUMI TSUJI was billed as a straight-talking factory hand when he was
appointed president of Nissan Motor, Japan's second biggest vehicle maker,
in June. He has since lost no time burnishing the image, writes Steven
Butler.
Just two months after he took the wheel, Nissan announced in late August
that it would slip into the red in the year to March, posting a Y20bn loss.
The open admission of a financial loss is never easy for a Japanese company,
and often is something that can be disguised by accounting gimmickry.
Mr Tsuji's decision to admit Nissan's difficulties openly has let in a gust
of fresh air, and left him in a stronger position to try to turn the company
around. Yet this will not be an easy task, as Nissan's difficulties appear
to be deepening almost by the month.
September's car sales in Japan were bad for the industry, falling by 4.4 per
cent year-on-year. Yet Nissan's sales were abysmal, falling by 19.3 per
cent. While one month's statistics do not establish a trend, nine months do.
Nissan sales were off by 9.6 per cent to 1.03m units in the year to
September, compared with an industry-wide decline of 5.7 per cent. This has
pushed down Nissan's share of the market by one percentage point to 22.8 per
cent. If Nissan continues to lose market share at home, the forecast of a
Y20bn loss for the year could prove optimistic.
The reasons for Nissan's loss of market share are fairly straightforward.
The company has not caught up with the trend toward recreational vehicles
that helped Mitsubishi Motors boost sales by nearly 9 per cent in August.
Unlike Toyota, Nissan has recently had a dearth of new model cars to inspire
its customers.
Even so, Nissan's poor sales performance seems surprising given the huge and
in the main successful efforts by the company to remake the company's image
and win new customers. Under the leadership of Mr Yutaka Kume, then
president now chairman, Nissan established a design trend in 1987 with its
smash hit Cima luxury sedan. This was the first move by Japanese car
designers toward rounded lines, nostalgic body shapes drawn from earlier
decades, and experiments with radically new concepts.
Yet where Nissan led, its smaller and nimble competitors, Mazda, Mitsubishi,
and Honda, followed with great success. Nissan is stuck in the middle. It
sells a full range of cars to meet almost every need, but at half the size
of Toyota it cannot match Toyota's economies of scale. It has also never had
Toyota's knack for super-efficient factory management. When in earlier
decades Nissan tried to match Toyota's strategy of selling relatively safe,
dull designs to mainstream customers, it saw its market share decline
steadily from about 30 per cent to 23 per cent.
At the same time, Nissan is enough in the dull mainstream of the market to
risk losing customers should its designs appear too radical. And the
customers attracted by Nissan's more radical designs are easily won over by
the bolder attempts of other makers.
As a result Mr Kume's strategy of stressing design and going for market
share appears to have fallen flat. Worse, Mr Kume left Nissan with a heavy
burden of net debt, amounting to Y3,568bn at the end of March, or 147 per
cent of equity.
Mr Tsuji's strategy to cope with this has been to go back to basics and to
try to improve productivity by 10 per cent a year on the factory floor. The
problem, as he sees it, is that Nissan cars are just too complex, and they
need to be engineered for simplicity.
Nissan has also decided to cut directors salaries and to reduce hiring so
that the size of the staff will fall gradually by 4,000, or 6 per cent in
the next three years.
Beyond this, the strategy is just to hang on. Nissan's profits should begin
to recover in a year or two as the heavy burden of depreciation costs,
resulting from the company's ambitious investment programme, begins to ease.
Nissan considered cutting capacity but decided this would prevent it from
enjoying a surge in profits when the market eventually recovers. Even now,
Nissan is just 60,000 vehicles sales away from the break even point.
There is, therefore, a light at the end of the tunnel for Nissan. The
difficulty is that the light is moveable, depending on how long it takes for
the market to recover. The danger for Nissan is that a slow recovery could
force it to take more drastic measures.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (19): Sudden death of a golden
age - The year when Japan's domestic cars market forgot to grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE was one thing Japan's automobile companies could always count on,
it was being able to sell cars to the Japanese public in steadily rising
numbers. This happy situation at home provided an enormous source of
strength for the industry - yielding ever increasing cash flow and profits
that supported the industry's enormous international expansion of the past
decade.
This golden era has come to an abrupt end. Indeed, the prolonged weakness in
domestic demand, coming at the tail end of an investment boom, has left the
industry with vast overcapacity - with the ability to make nearly 13m
passenger cars a year stacked against current production of just over 9m.
The question facing the industry is no longer when growth will resume; it is
when and how severely the domestic industry may have to shrink. This is a
question that no Japanese car company is yet willing to face squarely.
Cutting capacity runs against the basic ethic of Japanese-style management.
Yet the pressure on the industry has become enormous.
In the 10 years to 1990 domestic vehicle sales in all categories measured by
registration grew in every year by an average of 4.5 per cent. In the three
years to 1990, with domestic demand stoked by historically low interest
rates, passenger car sales roared ahead by 16 per cent a year. From 1987 to
1990, domestic car sales grew by 56 per cent to 5.1m units, including both
minicars and the rapidly-growing luxury sector.
These were heady days. The low interest rates, combined with a booming stock
market, reduced the cost of raising capital for the car companies to one per
cent and less. As a result the companies had money and they spent it to
expand capacity aimed at meeting demand that appeared to grow insatiably,
with the public buying ever larger and more exotic cars.
Yet suddenly, just as Toyota, Nissan, and Mazda are opening new assembly
plants at home, demand has collapsed. 1990 itself was a bad year. Car sales
dropped by 4.6 per cent to 4.87m vehicles. This year sales have fallen
steadily, and are likely to finish the year roughly 5 per cent down from
1991. While this is bad enough in itself, the prospects for a recovery in
sales look extremely dim.
Mr Richard Ko, automobile analyst in Tokyo at Barclays de Zoete Wedd
Securities, taking into account factors such as household income, passenger
car vehicle stock, and household assets, has projected that 1993 will see no
growth in vehicles sales. In 1994 he estimates sales will grow by only 1.7
per cent, and by just 3 per cent in 1995. This will be insufficient to
return sales to the record level set in 1990.
Japan's per capita car ownership is the lowest among industrial countries,
with 286 cars per thousand population in 1990 compared to 400 in the UK and
667 in the USA. Yet with Japan's population ageing rapidly, and with road
congestion a severe problem everywhere in the country, there is little hope
that the Japanese market will ever again be a source of sustained, rapid
growth.
The impact of the downturn in the domestic market has been severe. Parent
company operating profits at Japan's five biggest automobile companies were
off by an unweighted average of 44 per cent in fiscal 1992. Properly
weighted the average would be much worse, with Toyota, which supplies 40 per
cent of the domestic market, down by 63.1 per cent, and Nissan, number two,
off 72 per cent.
The outlook for this year has grown steadily worse. Nissan said in late
August that it would post a parent-company after-tax loss of Y20bn, and
would suspended its interim dividend payment. Mazda said its net profits
would plunge by 62 per cent, and the company has decided to cut dividend
payments by 20 per cent this year. In spite of the forecast, many analysts
believe Mazda will stay in the black only with difficulty.
The response to this severe decline, so far, has been relatively muted, as
the car companies have selected items from the thumb-worn menu of Japanese
management practices. Nissan, perhaps most severely affected, has decided to
reduce hiring so as to shrink the company's workforce by 4,000, or 6 per
cent, in the next three years by attrition.
Part-time employment throughout the industry has been chopped back, although
this is impossible to measure with any precision. Overtime has also been
cut, along with executive salaries. Most companies are operating plants on
single shifts, but this decline in output has not yet been fast enough to
move bulging inventories of unsold cars off the lots.
There has been much talk in the industry of saving costs by means of more
clever and economical engineering. All companies are making efforts to
reduce the variety of parts that go into a single car, thereby restricting
consumer choice. Efforts are also being made to use more common parts in
different vehicle models. Toyota, however, has questioned whether this
effort can result in significant savings. A senior executive at Mitsubishi
Motors says the cost to consumers could actually rise, if this strategy is
adopted, since parts specifications would have to be standardised to meet
the highest tolerance in a class of vehicles.
Every company but Toyota talks about wanting to lengthen model cycles and
charge higher prices for cars. But if Toyota does not lead the way, which
now looks unlikely, no other car company could withstand the pressure of
trying to go it alone.
The years ahead, therefore, look very much like a survival of the fittest.
Unless the market returns to health more quickly than envisioned,
financially weaker players, such as Nissan or Mazda, may have to take more
drastic measures to stay in the running.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (22): Land of the dream machine
 -California is the Mecca of car design
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MCCORMICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDERS often deride California as a dream-world, where glitter takes
precedence over reality.
But car designers, hunting for inspiration, find the quirky, free-wheeling
nature of the California life-style irresistible. Over the past decade 19
car design studios have set up camp in southern California. They represent
many of the major manufacturers which compete in the north American market.
Most are Japanese Europan car companies. Not only is California a huge
life-style laboratory, it is also by far the largest and most affluent car
market in the US.
In 1991, 1.5m cars and trucks were sold in the Golden state, out of a
national total of 12.5m: only Florida came close with just over 1m sales.
Equally significant is the fact that Californians are far less loyal to
American cars than people in other states: imported models account for half
the cars sold in California, compared with a national figure of 30 per cent.
With such diversity of cars on its roads, designers naturally gravitate to
California. Jerry Hirshberg, head of Nissan's design studio in San Diego,
observes: 'For me it's like living in an international design show. Unlike
Detroit, Japan or anywhere else, in California you see everything and you
see it right away, it's inspirational, very challenging.'
Tom Tremont, chief designer at Chrysler's Pacifica studio, one of the first
to be set up on the west coast, concurs: 'Southern California has always
been known as a trend setting area, whether for fashion, for politics or
cars. It's a unique place, so everybody is focusing here - there's really no
other place in the world where you can find so many design studios.'
Verena Kloos, director of Volkswagen Design at the company's two-year-old
studio in California's Simi Valley, describes the scene on a typical Los
Angeles freeway as 'a rolling car show'.
Like the longer established Japanese studios, VW's west coast design centre
exists to report back to the home office on the latest trends and fashions
in California, and to develop concepts for future cars for Audi as well as
Volkswagen.
Although the centre is relatively new, it has already contributed towards a
proposed off-road version of the Golf, inspired in part by the soaring
popularity in America of 'sport utility vehicles'. 'It's intended to be a
fun vehicle for active life-style buyers that can be driven off-road
occasionally,' says VW.
To date, most sport utility vehicles have tended to be large and luxurious,
like the Range Rover. But the influence of the sun-loving Californians has
led some designers to look at smaller, less expensive machines. As a result,
a series of sophisticated dune buggy-like concept vehicles have been making
the rounds of US motor shows.
The impact of VW's west coast studio has also been felt in the choice of
colours and wheel designs for the current generation Golf, which makes its
debut in America next year.
For the Japanese, the influence of the California studios runs much deeper
and is felt around the world. Toyota was the first Japanese car maker to
build a design facility, called CALTY, in California. It also has a factory
located in the state, operated jointly with General Motors.
Established in 1973 in trendy Newport Beach, CALTY has designed several
cars, including the Celica and Previa minivan, which are sold by Toyota in
most of its overseas markets.
A more recent CALTY design, the sleek Lexus SC400 luxury coupe, is currently
marketed only in America and Japan. The story behind the widely admired
shape of the SC400 would be hard to believe had it not come from California.
Rather than start with conventional two-dimensional drawings, SC400 chief
designer Erwin Lui filled ballons with wet plaster, which he moulded into
organic shapes as it set. The plaster forms were then photographed and
projected on to a screen which was slanted to elongate the shapes.
The most inspirational shape, says Lui, had the look of a bow tie, and that
became the basis for the look of the SC400. 'We never touched pencil to
paper until the design process was virtually completed,' Lui says.
Honda employs more than 100 design and research taff at its LA Centre in
Torrance, California. 'We have to design cars in the US in order to market
successfully in the US,' says Honda. 'Sometimes it's difficult for the guys
in Japan to design cars for American tastes.'
The newly introduced Civic coupe was penned by Honda's west coast designers,
as were the Accord estate, Accord Coupe and first generation Civic CRX
before it. Tom Elliott, a senior American Honda executive, says that the
next generation Accord saloon, a crucial car for the company, will 'reflect
the influence of our US design studio'.
In Nissan's case, the company's San Diego studio had a strong influence on
the design of 300ZX sports coupe, which is sold worldwide. It has been
solely responsible for several other models, including the Infiniti J30 and
Altima saloons, intended mainly for the US market.
As well as designing new cars, Nissan's Hirshberg makes sure his staff spend
time travelling and observing the world around them. One life-style project
involved taking photos of hundreds of 'real people' driving their cars.
'We've developed all sorts of interesting ideas in trying to conceive of
vans or sports cars or some new category we haven't thought of before.'
Hirshberg quotes one example of a picture of a girl with frizzy hair and a
dirty, dented car. 'We felt we'd discovered a whole new category here called
'unkempt' - all those kids who are very carefully avoiding being well kept.
It's a potential category for a car that you may buy - like used jeans ..'

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (24): The climate is changing -
Stephen Joseph asks:  How secure is the motor car's future?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN JOSEPH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAR industry, and all the industries that feed it, from tyres to oil,
dominate Western economies. Hence the adage 'what's good for General Motors
is good for the USA'.
More appropriate, perhaps, is Shelley's verse about the words found on an
ancient tablet in the sands of the desert:
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings. Look on my works ye mighty and
despair.
The mighty car industry may not be about to follow Ozymandias into oblivion,
but it certainly faces some tough challenges, starting with environmental
pressures of pollution (local and global), noise and resource use.
The car industry applauds itself for responding to them by fitting catalytic
converters, promoting recycling of components, accepting progressively
tougher exhaust emission standards.
But limits on these may have been reached. The German car industry has told
politicians that proposed new pollution standards are unachievable.
California, the most motorised country on earth, is demanding 'zero emission
vehicles', making the motor industry move towards alternative fuels such as
gas, electricity or plant-based bio-fuels.
Such options are not available for all countries, and in any case may
conflict with other energy demands or other land uses. Electric cars simply
shift pollution from street to power station, which means extra coal or
nuclear stations, neither of which are environmentally attractive.
So the environmental challenge is shifting towards restricting car use, or
even ownership. Governments extrapolating past trends in travel have
produced forecasts of traffic growth which are environmentally frightening
and, in cities and densely populated European countries, are clearly going
to produce 'gridlock'.
Old road lobby arguments that building roads will free traffic and therefore
cut pollution from stop-start driving are being squashed by the sheer weight
of projected traffic. Policy options to address these forecasts vary, and
depend on cultural and political factors in each country.
Few Westerners realise that in Japan, home of the fastest growing motor
industry, urban dwellers cannot own a car unless they can prove they have an
off-street parking space for it.
Such options are less likely to be acceptable in the US or Europe, but
increasing controls on car use seem likely. Road pricing, charging people to
drive into congested cities, seems in tune with free market economics and is
actively under consideration in many countries, though politicians are
treading warily after angry motorists burned an Oslo toll booth.
'Sticks' such as pricing, area bans or increased parking controls are
therefore likely to be packaged with 'carrots' such as improved public
transport, park and ride and better pedestrian and cycle facilities.
But congestion is no longer just an urban problem; popular rural areas like
National Parks suffer it too, and Governments are looking at restraint or
even bans on cars in key 'honeypot areas' such as Yosemite valley or
Britain's Peak District.
On their own, policies that restrain cars in some congested areas pose no
real threat to the car industry. Indeed, European car makers have accepted
it and are even in places promoting park and ride themselves (the British
industry, depressingly, does not yet seem to see the problem with traffic
growth).
But the evidence is that such area restraint will not be enough to meet the
environmental challenge; policy-makers trying to control greenhouse gases or
improve local air quality simply cannot accept indefinite traffic growth. So
policies that restrain traffic in certain areas may be joined by others.
One approach, adopted in principle by the European Commission, is that
'transport is too cheap'. The road lobby case, that motorists pay more in
taxes than they get in road spending, is being undermined by economists
calculating the environmental and other costs caused by road transport and
demanding that these costs be 'internalised' in taxing road vehicles.
Environmentalists have seized on this; the European Federation for Transport
and Environment (T&amp;E), which brings together environmental groups across
Europe (not just the EC), is carrying out a study on the extent of external
costs and ways to internalise them.
The first target may be freight traffic, which policy makers generally
accept is under-taxed, but cars may follow. One transport academic has
suggested it be part of 'ecological tax reform', shifting taxation from
labour and capital on to motoring and other environmentally damaging
activities.
There is a means and ends argument here, whether internalising costs is an
end in itself or just one means (allied with regulation and public spending)
to meet environmental targets, but the effect would still be huge.
Complementing this are moves to change land use planning so as to reduce car
dependence. Australia has already opted for 'urban consolidation'; the
British Government is already issuing guidance to councils urging them to
plan so as to cut car use, and the Dutch planning system now divides
locations and activities on the extent of car use.
Those are just the environmental challenges. Safety poses another set of
questions. Some academics and policy-makers now argue that making cars safer
only allows drivers to drive faster and therefore kill more pedestrians and
cyclist.
There is a broader issue here, of people, especially children, being driven
off the street by traffic. This adds to arguments for area restraint and
traffic calming but it also poses more fundamental challenges to the car
culture of speed and power.
The car is not just a means of travel, it is a cultural icon, a symbol of
wealth and status, celebrated in song and story. But such icons have come
and gone. Climates are changing, in policy as well as in the planet.
The medical profession is beginning to target the car as a public health
problem. Like that other public health problem, the cigarette, the car
industry still has plenty of unexploited third world markets to open up, but
the difference is that third world tobacco addiction hurts only the smokers
 -China and Africa aspiring to Californian levels of car use will hurt
California as well as themselves. The car bears the seeds of its own
destruction; its promise of freedom is diluted by jams today, and more
tomorrow.
Maybe the genie of personal mobility cannot go back in the bottle, maybe the
huge lobbying power of the car industry will keep the environmental
challenges at bay or under wraps. But the challenges are huge and they will
not be solved by technical fixes alone.
And if the world can find less transport-dependent forms of economic growth,
as it has made growth less energy-intensive, the car's pivotal role in
society will diminish and human expressions of status and fashion may
transfer to something less damaging.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (23): Seven may not be a lucky
number - South Korea moves up in the world table of car producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's motor industry is hoping that sharply rising exports to
Western Europe will help reverse a decline in earnings.
Although total car sales last year rose by 15 per cent to 1.5m units,
profits for Korea's big three automakers - Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo - fell
due to heavy financial costs stemming from production investments as well as
a series of labour disputes.
The expansion of industrial facilities is expected this year to make Korea
the world's seventh largest car maker in terms of production capacity with a
maximum annual output of more than 2m vehicles, according to the Korea
Automobile Manufacturers Association (KAMA). But Korean companies now have
excessive production capacity, with the utilisation ratio falling to 61 per
cent.
The car companies believe earnings will recover this year due to the
introduction of new models and increased sales in Europe, the Middle East
and Latin America, which will compensate for falling demand in the US.
The Korean car industry remains heavily dependent on the home market, which
accounted for 74 per cent of sales last year with 1.1m vehicles sold.
Domestic sales are likely to grow by 15 per cent this year following a
similar rise in 1991, according to KAMA.
But this may be achieved at the cost of slimmer profit margins. Korean
carmakers have been forced to offer longer interest-free consumer loans,
which are adding to their financial costs, in order to reduce a growing
inventory of vehicles.
The car backlog increased after the recent introduction of new car-ownership
taxes, already among the highest in the world, as well as increased petrol
prices. Moreover, the rise in car sales is mainly concentrated at the lower
price end of the market.
The big three producers are launching new models to revive consumer interest
in the middle and upper range car market.
Hyundai, Korea's largest car company with a 46 per cent domestic market
share, is introducing new versions of its top-of-the-line Grandeur, the
Excel, its most popular domestic and foreign model last year, and the Sonata
sedan.
Kia Motors has launched the Potentia to compete against the Grandeur. A new
version of the Pride, the best selling car in South Korea, will follow next
year. Daewoo Motor has produced new models of the Espero, Prince and
Supersalon.
The intense competition at home is forcing Korean carmakers to concentrate
more attention on export markets to recover profits.
Sales of Korean cars in the US, the main overseas market, have dropped
sharply since 1988 due to the US economic slowdown and the poor reputation
for quality that Korean cars gained in the late 1980s.
The downturn in the US caused total Korean car exports to fall from a peak
of 576,000 in 1988 to a low of 347,000 in 1990, although exports this year
will rise to an estimated 465,000.
With US consumer resistance still considered strong in spite of a noticeable
improvement in quality of Korean cars, the makers have shifted their
marketing focus to Western Europe.
Europe this year has emerged as the Korean industry's biggest export market
for the first time. Exports to Europe accounted for 27.6 per cent of total
overseas car shipments during the first eight months compared with 14.3 per
cent last year. Hyundai, which has rapidly expanded in the European market
in the past two years, provided 95 per cent of the Korean vehicles sold in
Europe.
Meanwhile, the US share of total Korean car exports has fallen to 23.5 per
cent from 43.9 per cent a year ago. While Korean car exports to Europe grew
by 130 per cent during the first eight months of 1992, exports to the Middle
East rose by 300 per cent and to Latin America by 351 per cent. Europe is
expected to remain the leading importer of Korean cars next year, with the
opening of several new national markets including France.
Korean cars remain price competitive against their Japanese rivals due to
the depreciation of the Korean won and the rising value of the yen.
As part of the overseas push, Korean carmakers are also locating production
facilities abroad. Hyundai now has a plant in Canada. Kia is establishing a
joint venture car plant in Indonesia, while Daewoo plans to produce cars in
Uzbekistan by 1995. The automakers are planning to set up facilities in
China.
Although exports rose by 19 per cent during the first eight months of 1992,
the buoyant growth has so far been unable to halt a slide in profits. But
analysts believe that earnings could rebound in the second half of the year.
Hyundai's net profit for the first half of 1992 fell by 37 per cent to
won26bn, although sales rose by 18 per cent to won2,940bn. But it blamed the
drop on a month-long strike in January as well as financing costs associated
with the expansion of production capacity.
It predicts earnings will reach won95bn this year against won54bn in 1991,
while sales will climb from won5,605bn to won6,200bn due to strong export
growth.
Kia Motors, the second largest car producer with 25 per cent domestic market
share, reported that net profits fell by 37 per cent to won3.5bn as it
increased its production capacity by 30 per cent. Sales rose by 18 per cent
to won1,530bn. Analysts estimate that Kia will make net profits of won11bn,
against won15.8bn in 1991, on sales of won3,200bn.
Analysts estimate that unlisted Daewoo Motor had a loss of won50bn, although
this represents an improvement over its deficit of won146.7bn a year ago.
The earnings performance of Daewoo Motor remains uncertain following General
Motors' decision to sell its 50 per cent share in the joint venture to
Daewoo's parent company for an estimated Dollars 170m.
The Daewoo group has also started producing cars through another unlisted
subsidiary, Daewoo Shipbuilding. The introduction of its Tico mini-car last
year proved popular since it is exempt from special excise taxes and uses
less petrol.
Daewoo Motor, which has 13 per cent of the domestic market, is considered
the most vulnerable among the big three carmakers if Samsung possibly enters
the industry within the next few years. Samsung has a strong financial
position and invests heavily in research programmes, making it a formidable
competitor.
Samsung Shipbuilding was recently allowed by the government to begin
building commercial vehicles in what some analysts believe is a preliminary
step to its manufacture of passenger cars.
Samsung's truck operations could also pose a threat to Asia Motors, a
subsidiary of Kia, and Ssangyong Motors since a large share of their
business is in the commercial vehicle segment. Both Asia and Ssangyong also
make jeeps.
Asia had a loss of won4bn during the first half of 1992 as it completed a
new vehicle factory.
Ssangyong reported a 34 per cent profit to won3.16bn as jeep sales slid to
increased competition from Hyundai.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of Locating in North America (1): Investment
continues - BMW is just the latest example of a remarkable surge in foreign
direct investment in North America, partly with the establishment of
greenfield operations but most dramatically through the takeover of US
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON

<TEXT>
THERE is no more dramatic example in recent years of a European company
locating in North America than BMW's announcement this summer that it would
be building a new plant in South Carolina, its first outside West Germany.
BMW had spent three years scouring the world for a manufacturing site after
deciding that it needed new capacity outside Germany. Its decision to plump
for the US - and South Carolina - tells a great deal about the factors
driving European and Japanese companies in general to locate in North
America.
BMW wanted to be close to the already large American market for its vehicles
and to be within the proposed North American Free Trade Area, which promises
a big increase in intra-American trade over the next decade.
It was lured to South Carolina by factors which included generous state
financing and worker training programmes; easy access to ports for exporting
and importing; and an Eastern time zone, making communications with Germany
easier.
BMW is just the latest example of a remarkable surge in foreign direct
investment in North America which developed in the 1980s, partly through the
establishment of greenfield operations, but most dramatically through the
takeover of US companies. Direct foreign investment in the US rose from
Dollars 83bn in 1980 to Dollars 403.7bn in 1990, according to the Commerce
Department.
The surge has slowed somewhat over the past two years as the takeover wave
of the 1980s has died away. However the region continues to enjoy a steady
stream of new greenfield investment and the overall volume is likely to
gather momentum again when the western world eventually moves out of
recession.
For the past two years European companies have tended to focus their
energies on matters nearer home: the problems of operating in an economic
recession and the opportunities supposedly opened by the European
Community's 1992 initiative and the collapse of the Soviet empire. Japanese
companies have domestic economic concerns as well and several have been
stung by paying excessively high prices for US assets in the 1980s.
However, the recent political and economic turmoil in Europe, as well as the
realisation that it will take years before the former Soviet bloc provides
meaningful profits, may help refocus attention on North America.
After all, the US remains by far the world's largest market speaking a
single language. And the creation of a North American Free Trade Area
(Nafta), including Canada and Mexico, will make the market even larger,
presenting companies with some 365m potential consumers. The Nafta pact, on
which broad agreement was reached over the summer, now awaits final wording
and legislative approval.
That said, foreign companies already in the US, and prospective investors,
must be extremely concerned about the outline proposals of Mr Bill Clinton,
the democratic presidential nominee, to increase the taxes of foreign
multinationals operating in the country. A similar proposal has recently
been circulating in Congress.
Moreover, entering the North American market presents many pitfalls for the
unwary. BMW is only too well aware of the unfortunate precedent of fellow
German motor company Volkswagen, which invested in a US plant in the late
1970s only to pull out in 1988 after suffering heavy losses.
Reasons for VW's defeat included a reputation for poor quality at its
Pennsylvanian plant, insufficient productivity there, and a failure to
market successfully to the US consumer.
Yet the US car market can be conquered by foreign entrants, as Japanese
manufacturers such as Toyota and Honda demonstrated during the 1980s with
immensely successful greenfield plants. Japanese companies now account for
about 30 per cent of the US car market.
That said, not even the Japanese have been infallible in North America:
Nissan, one of Japan's leading car companies, has struggled for years to
raise its share of the US market.
Multinational companies such as these devote great attention to picking the
right site for North American operations. But evidence suggests that too
many other companies pay only scant attention to this, often simply locating
a new facility next to an existing one, or merely considering a single
state.
This may save time in the short run but over the longer term it may prove
costly. Experts in the field say key factors which should be considered by
any company include:
Geographical and communications factors. How close does a company need to be
to the market it is serving? And how good are the road, rail, air and
telecommunications links between the proposed location and both the market
and head office?
Many European companies prefer to be on the eastern seaboard, closest to
home in terms of both time and distance, while many Japanese companies
prefer the Pacific coast for the same reason.
However, some consultants argue that too many companies simply pick the
largest city as a base in their preferred geographical region, ignoring the
advantages of so-called second cities. These are smaller cities, often a
short commuter flight from the main centre, with good academic facilities
and which may offer the company cheaper costs, a more qualified labour
force, better infrastructure and a more pleasant way of life.
Relative costs of land, labour and property. These costs vary greatly around
the US and within individual regions. A big factor encouraging United
Parcels Service to relocate from the New England state of Connecticut to
Atlanta, Georgia, was the high cost of housing in Connecticut, which made it
hard for the company to persuade good regional managers to relocate to
headquarters. Connecticut, for its part, has spent several decades picking
up companies relocating from expensive New York City.
Local education standards. Educational achievement levels vary widely around
the US, but most states now recognise that raising the country's relatively
poor standards is vital to attracting new investors who demand sophisticated
workforces.
Companies which only require unskilled labour will tend to look to Third
World countries, lacking minimum wage legislation, rather than to the US.
State and local government aid. US states and counties, scarred by recession
and unemployment, are bidding vigorously against one another for new
investment through generous tax rebates and other incentives. Very
attractive packages can also often be negotiated with some local electricity
utilities.
Training assistance. This is a new form of state aid which is likely to play
an increasingly important role in greenfield site selection in future.
Several states, such as South Carolina and Georgia, have agreed to pay for
the pre-job training of companies locating there.
South Carolina's willingness to shoulder these costs was one of the most
important factors attracting BMW to the state. The training involves not
just the technical skills needed to work in the plant but softer issues,
such as teamwork and how factory floor employees can assume greater
responsibility.
Mr Robert Ady, president of PHH Fantus, an international business location
consulting firm which advised BMW on its new plant, says this focus on
pre-employment training is a relatively new and important trend.
New manufacturing techniques mean more responsibility is being pushed down
to the factory floor, but workers are reluctant to accept this new
'empowerment.'
Mr Ady says that roughly 50 per cent of necessary pre-job training may now
consist of such 'soft' management issues. However, he adds that it is often
hard for state legislatures to see the benefits of voting money for training
in 'how to have more fun on the job.'
Choosing a location acceptable to relocating staff. There is a danger that a
company will fix on an area which makes sense from a cost viewpoint but then
find difficulty in getting its best people to move to the area.
Many foreigners, for example, would feel more comfortable in the
cosmopolitan environment of a big city such as New York than in some of the
more insular towns of the American interior.
Relocation advisers say that 40 per cent or more of corporate transferees
often refuse to relocate.
Managements which have not accurately gauged in advance the acceptability of
their plans may find business seriously disrupted while they train fresh
staff at their new location.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Survey of World Car Industry (25): Safety for the driver and
his planet - Stuart Marshall explores the environmental and other features
of Europe's latest models
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE new models that will be entering European showrooms over the next 12
months will reflect the industry's success in meeting environmental needs as
well as consumer demands.
From next January, every new petrol-engined car must have a catalytic
converter to clean up the exhaust. Some sections of the industry perceived
the EC requirement as a politically inspired expedient. But they faced up to
the challenge, equipping even the smallest and cheapest of their cars with
the electronic fuel injection needed for a catalyser to work properly.
Multi-valve engines have for some years been widely used by all Japanese
makers on high volume production, as opposed to specialised high
performance, cars. This was not the case in Europe, though Saab and Rover
were among the few honourable exceptions as multi-valve pioneers.
Now, however, they are being adopted by European manufacturers across the
whole price spectrum as a means of improving power outputs without
increasing cylinder capacity.
Among the latest multi-valve models are a wide range of Ford Escorts and the
Mercedes Benz 200-300 cars, due to be joined early next year by the
replacement for the best selling 190.
V6 engines are enjoying a vogue because of the space they save compared with
in-line designs, which do not fit transversely into front-wheel driven cars.
An alternative solution, seen in the latest Volvo 850GLT, is to mount a
5-cylinder in-line engine east-west combined with an ultra-compact manual or
automatic transmission.
The most space-saving conventional piston engine of all is the narrow angle
V6, first used more than 60 years ago by Lancia. Audi and Volkswagen are
employing two different narrow angle V6s occupying hardly any more space
than in-line 4-cylinder engines of far less cylinder capacity in a number of
models, including the VW Golf and Vento, the Audi 80 and 100.
This illustrates another growing trend - the fitting of comparatively large
displacement and high power output engines into cars of modest size. These
provide the performance, and offer all the luxury equipment, expected of
products in the next size class. Big is no longer beautiful among many
motorists who spend much of their time driving on their own in crowded
traffic conditions.
Availability from early next year of the mid-sized General Motors Vauxhall
Cavalier (Opel Vectra in most European markets) with a new British-built,
narrow angle 2.5 litre V6 engine is a straw in the wind. So, too, is BMW's
decision to offer its new V8 engines, originally introduced in the big
7-Series and intended to power its forthcoming replacement, in the 5-Series
as well.
Saab, also GM controlled, is expected soon to be using the British-made 2.5
V6 but has its own ideas for improving performance and minimising emissions.
The GM link has given Saab access to 32-bit microprocessor technology. It is
combined with a direct ignition system having a mini-coil per cylinder and
no high-tension leads or distributor. This 32-bit component (most other
makers use 8-bit or 16-bit microprocessors) provides exceptionally precise
monitoring and control of transient state conditions within the engine.
So exactly does the Saab Trionic system, with its 2m calculations each
second, control combustion that it is claimed to make the 2.3 litre,
turbocharged 4-cylinder engine of 1993 Saab 9000CS and CD models one of the
world's cleanest. In the foreseeable future, the Trionic system will allow a
petrol engine to be run on less polluting alternative fuels such as ethanol
or methanol without any adjustment.
Two-stroke engines, far smaller and lighter than four-strokes of the same
power output, are being developed by many car makers on both sides of the
Atlantic and in Japan.
Ford is monitoring the performance of a fleet of two-stroke powered Fiestas
in service with a British police force.
Toyota has demonstrated an ultra-light and fuel efficient two-stroke powered
concept town car. Chrysler also has some promising two-stroke engines at an
advanced development stage in the US.
The Japanese motor industry has an unnerving habit of rapidly turning
concept cars into production models. For example, both Mitsubishi 3000GT and
Subaru SVX were on sale within two years of being unveiled to the public at
Tokyo motor show. Even so, the Japanese do not expect two-stroke engines to
be in the showrooms in 1993 but a mid-decade timescale looks more promising.
But for the time being, there is agreement among major European
manufacturers that the diesel engine, preferably with turbocharging,
intercooling and direct injection, provides the best fuel economy.
Although there is a public perception that diesels are dirty - and
ill-maintained heavy lorries and buses undoubtedly are - a diesel car is at
least as environmentally acceptable as one with a petrol engine and
three-way catalytic converter.
There is a clear relationship between atmospheric pollution and fuel
consumption. The diesel engine, especially when operating at less than full
power and at constantly changing revolutions - as it does in traffic - has a
much lower specific fuel consumption than a petrol engine. Hence its carbon
dioxide emissions are proportionately lower and its efficient combustion
process also creates less carbon monoxide.
Now that inherent noise problems have been overcome by two-stage injectors
and other means, the direct-injection car diesel is pointing to fuel economy
beyond the capability of petrol engines.
Without any special preparation, a new Audi 100 TDI saloon with 6-speed
gearbox recently gained an entry in the Guinness Book of Records by being
driven further on a single tankful than any other car. In showroom trim, it
went from John o' Groats to Lands End and then back again north of the
Scottish border on 17.62 gallons (80.17 litres) of fuel, giving a
consumption of 75.94 mpg (3.72 l/100 km).
The industry is now concentrating on further reducing the diesel car
engine's particulate emissions (visible exhaust smoke), the only area in
which it is significantly worse than a petrol engine.
The main line of attack is to refine the fuel injection and combustion
process and clean the exhaust gases by a simple oxidation catalyser.
Automatic transmissions are gaining ground as urban driving in particular
becomes more stressful. There can be no argument that a car with two pedals
makes fewer demands on the driver in heavy traffic than one with three.
Safety can only benefit. Just as 4-speed automatics have virtually taken
over from the old 3-speed types, those with 5-speeds are making steady
headway in cars of medium price and above.
This kind of technological advance always spreads downward. When ABS brakes
were first introduced, they were costly extra equipment on the most
expensive cars. Now buyers expect them to be standard on modestly priced
cars, particularly those of higher than average performance potential.
In the same way, traction control systems have become increasingly popular
on executive-class cars. They make use of the ABS brake system's electronic
sensors to eliminate the risk of wheelspin and consequent loss of control
when accelerating by matching engine output to tyre grip.
Full-time four wheel drive performs a similar function but traction control
has been found to provide most of the benefits without the weight and cost
penalties.
On the safety front, enhanced protection for the occupants in side impacts
is now a feature of many high volume production cars. Similarly, airbags
which inflate in severe frontal impacts and reduce risk of facial injury to
drivers and front seat passengers are spreading down market. They cost extra
 -usually over Pounds 500 - but as demand grows, prices must fall.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Caribbeans press for EC banana
regime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARIBBEAN BANANA exporters have no preference for either a quota-based or a
tariff-based banana import regime in the Europe Community - as long as the
EC stands by obligations to them under the Lome Convention, according to Mr
John Compton, prime minister of St Lucia.
His comments come at a time of mounting pressure to put an EC-wide banana
regime in place ahead of the creation of the European single market on
January 1, 1993.
Commission proposals for a quota-based system have attracted criticism
because of their complexity, and the scope they provide for abuse.
Amid claims that the EC has not adequately explored tariff-based options,
the current proposals are intended to insulate Lome promises to protect the
livelihoods of Caribbean islanders against unfettered multinational
competition. Many Caribbean islands - including St Lucia  - are heavily
dependent on banana exports, and fear political upheavals if EC market
access is undermined.
There are also fears that a breakthrough in the long-stalled Uruguay Round
of talks on world trade liberalisation - which aim to replace quota
arrangements with tariffs in all areas of international trade - would make
any quota-based regime unacceptable to the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, the Geneva-based world trade watchdog.
At the end of a diplomatic tour of Europe embracing Germany, Ireland and the
UK and intended to get EC member states to reaffirm their treaty commitments
under the Lome Convention, Mr Compton said tariffs or quotas were a matter
of 'mechanics'.
'Whether proposals for future banana trade are tariff-based, or quota-based,
we will examine them to see whether they discharge Europe's obligations
under Lome', he said.
Mr Compton was concerned that EC member states opposed to quotas would
prolong discussions.
Successive Lome agreements have assured the small economies of the Caribbean
access to the EC for their banana exports 'on terms and conditions no less
favourable than those enjoyed in the past'.
Grown by smallholders in difficult farming terrain, comparatively expensive
Caribbean bananas have been able to maintain a 20 per cent share of the EC
market of 3.3m tonnes by virtue of quotas from former colonial powers like
the UK and France.

LME BASE METAL prices again fell across the board as the wave of bearish
sentiment prompted renewed liquidation. Some prices edged away from their
lows in late kerb trading, but with economic fundamentals depressed and
further warehouse stock increases expected today, dealers expect the
downside to remain under threat. COPPER prices edged away from 4 1/2 -month
lows struck earlier, with the market regaining the Dollars 2,250 a tonne
level but still ending below Friday's close. The apparent turnaround by
China, previously a buyer of metals, has also undermined fragile confidence.
Chinese liquidation of ZINC pushed prices to eight-month lows and sales of
ALUMINIUM pushed that market to nine-month lows. NICKEL continued to skirt
its lowest levels since February 1990 as the market awaited further
production cuts. London COCOA made early gains of around Pounds 10 on
sterling weakness, but it failed to inspire buying from continental
manufacturers.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Research shows benefits of
lower pesticide use
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO STUDIES just published look at the links between farming and the
environment and highlight the growing importance to the agricultural
industry of countryside management.
The first is a Ministry of Agriculture publication on the findings of its
pioneer study of pesticide use at its research centre at Boxworth in
Cambridgeshire. One of its main messages to the farmer is that using less
pesticide can improve gross margins in spite of lower yields.
Tests were made over nine years on a total area of more than 120 hectares
(296 acres). Using a comprehensive insurance policy of routine applications
to eliminate any possibility of pests, weeds or disease led to wheat yields
of 7.74 tonnes a hectare and a gross margin of Pounds 454 a hectare. But
more considered use halved the number of applications in a year, leaving a
yield of 6.84 tonnes a hectare and a gross margin of Pounds 477.
What was considered low usage of chemical treatments during the Boxworth
experiment between 1981 and 1990 now looks high - an indication of how much
pesticide use has fallen over the last few years.
The Agriculture Ministry and the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors
have jointly funded a study by a team from Wye College in Kent into the
economics of greener farming practices. The resulting pamphlet, published
yesterday, is the first time that government initiatives such as the
Environmentally Sensitive Area schemes have been thoroughly analysed.
Mr Nicholas Woolley of the RICS said that taxpayers had a right to know if
they were getting value for money, while farmers needed to know the benefits
to them. In some ares, for example, ESA payments had increased farm income,
but reduced the market value of the land.

Yakutia on diamond profits
</HEADLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government and the diamond-producing region of Yakutia - now
called Sakha - have signed an agreement that has been hailed as a model for
the decentralisation of government authority to the autonomous republics of
the Russian Federation.
The agreement, signed by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the acting prime minister of
Russia and Mr Mikhail Nikolayev, President of Yakutia, allows a sharing of
the diamond revenues from the region, which produces almost all of the
country's diamonds. A new joint stock company, 'Diamonds of Russia-Sakha',
will be 40 per cent controlled by Yakutia, with 32.5 per cent of the shares
held by the Russian government.
The agreement appears to end a long struggle between the autonomous republic
and the central government on control of the diamonds, in the course of
which an agreement giving both governments an equal share in the proceeds of
diamond sales was repudiated by Yakutian officials. The republic has claimed
independence from Moscow.
Mr Gaidar said that the agreement 'proves that economic structures are being
decentralised in Russia'. Various regions and autonomous republics within
Russia, including the oil-producing Tyumen region, have demanded more
freedom in controlling and benefitting from hard currency exports.
Almazyuvelirexport, the diamond trading company that markets Russian
diamonds through an agreement with the South African company De Beers, which
controls most of the world diamond trade through its London-based Central
Selling Organisation, is to be incorporated into the new company.
Mr Leonid Gurevich, head of a parliamentary commission set up to oversee
diamond sales, said that the industry urgently required new investment. He
said this would form one of the conditions set in forthcoming negotiations
with De Beers on a renegotiation of the contract between the South African
and the Russian companies.

FT  20 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Little to celebrate at LME's
annual shindig - Sagging prices and soaring stocks are casting a shadow over
the exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS OF metals producers, consumers and traders are this week paying
their annual homage to the most international market in the world: the
London Metal Exchange. But there is a hollow ring to the celebrations. Gloom
caused by a recent and sudden collapse in metals prices keeps intruding.
At least half of worldwide contracts for the six metals traded on the
exchange are related directly to LME prices. And for much of this year
prices were doing quite well. By the end of September, the LME-traded metals
were showing price gains since the begining of 1992 ranging from 14 per cent
for tin to a more modest 5.5 per cent for lead.
But evidence that these prices were giving false signals was clear to see:
recession persisted in North America and parts of Europe; growth was slowing
rapidly in Germany and Japan, which, with the US, provide the biggest
markets for metals.
LME stock levels were rising as prices were going up, an unnatural
phenomenon, as any schoolboy economist will tell you. 'We had prices that
simply could not be justified by fundamental conditions,' Mr Phillip
Crowson, chief economic adviser at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest
mining company, points out. 'People who thought those prices were justified
were living in a fool's paradise.'
He suggests that a new and volatile source of demand for LME metals was at
work. Some heavyweight financial institutions had begun to invest in
commodities for the first time in ten to 15 years to diversify their
portfolios. 'Given the size of the metals markets, only a small shift in
fund investment pushes prices up substantially,' Mr Crowson points out.
Compared with other financial markets, the LME is relatively small, he says.
The total value of all its metal stocks was only about Dollars 2.2bn at the
start of 1992 and Dollars 3.4bn in late August. 'The cost of buying up total
existing stocks of some individual metals would be relatively low, although
only a portion is needed to influence the market.'
Investment interest from the funds has helped drive LME turnover - which is
much greater than the value of its stocks - to record levels this year. Mr
Crowson, who is an LME director, suggests: 'This is fine as long as the
institutions pay more than lip service to portfolio asset management - but
not if they become mesmerised by patterns of prices on charts'.
Some traders admit that, while the funds were making the running, they had
to concentrate on trying to guess what they might do next. Traders took
their attention away from the real world of falling demand and rising metal
supply surpluses.
Now the funds seem for the time being to have quit, bringing the market down
to earth with a nasty bump. Ms Lesley Campbell, a trader at Rudolf Wolff,
part of the Noranda natural resources group, explains: 'There have been
occasions in the past year when big players in the LME's copper, aluminium
and zinc markets provided price support - more than the fundamentals have
justified. Too many blind eyes were turned away from the fundamentals for
too long.'
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, a subsidiary of the Westpac banking
group, says: 'The commodity funds have been financing the record LME
stockpiles. now they are liquidating their positions.
'The market has completed a complete U-turn since August, he says. 'Suddenly
the market realised that economic recovery was not happening, it would be
longer delayed and more muted than expected. A short, sharp fall in growth
was expected in Japan, now it looks as if it will be a protracted fall.'
No wonder the OECD says that domestic product growth in its member countries
this year is now expected to be a maximum of 1.5 per cent when at the
begining of this year it was predicting growth of 2.3 per cent.
As the accompanying figures from the UK-based World Bureau of Metal
Statistics show, most of the LME metals were building supply surpluses
during the first half of this year. However, the copper market was more or
less in balance and tin stocks were falling, thanks to the efforts of the
Association of Tin Producing Countries, which has been limiting output so as
to cut the excessive stocks that have been depressing prices since the 1986
collapse of their price support scheme. The 43,000-tonne reduction in
aluminium stocks resulted from capacity reductions during the first half,
but that trend has since been reversed as new smelters have come on stream
and mothballed units have reopened.
Aluminium and nickel have been hit hard not only by slowing industrial
activity but also by the upsurge in exports from the former Soviet Union. Mr
Lloyd Davies, general manager of the WBMS, points out that commercial nickel
stocks have more or less doubled since the end of 1990 and 'this obviously
is the result of Russian shipments to the west.' Deliveries of nickel from
the CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) to the west in the first half
of this year might have been as much as 50,000 tonnes, roughly in line with
exports in the same months last year. 'Indeed, there might even have been a
growth in deliveries,' he says.
Recorded deliveries of aluminium from the CIS to the west were running at an
annualised rate of 650,000 tonnes compared with 500,000 in 1991, Mr Davies
points out. It would take a big fall in exports in the second half to
produce a significant drop in CIS aluminium deliveries this year.
Analysts say it is now clear that there will be no short-term industrial
growth to produce a demand-led recovery in metal prices. So there have been
widespread and vociferous calls for production cuts.
'There is no light at the end of the tunnel. Without meaningful production
cuts prices will deteriorate further,' says Mr Euan Worthington, head of the
mining team at the SG Warburg Securities financial services group.
Ord Minnett's Mr Moore suggests: 'The onus is back squarely on the
producers. The choice is simple - cut back refined metal production or spend
another year in purgatory'.
Mr Angus MacMillan, research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals, part of
the Royal Dutch/Shell group, suggests copper is the 'most over-priced' metal
at the moment. Supply interruptions, which usually play an important role in
the copper market, 'have been conspicuous by their absence. The Chinese, who
helped the copper price by buying heavily earlier this year, now might be
selling. Stocks have been building since August in a way that suggests this
is no ordinary summer slow-down. This is a market moving into surplus'.
On the other hand, Mr MacMillan suggests aluminium and nickel have less far
to fall than other LME metals because their prices have been so low for so
long. Zinc prices, buoyed up by a technical, options-related squeeze for
much of this year, have come back with a bump. 'The squeeze has ended and
the fundamentals have taken over,' he says. Tin demand is weak but lead
might get some support from labour contracts about to be negotiated - 'lead
is the metal I'm least bearish about. But, in all, the metal markets do not
present a pretty picture.'
RTZ's Mr Crowson hopes the various international political uncertainties
that are affecting sentiment will gradually be lifted in the coming months
but, even so, the outlook is not bright. Although he looks forward to
improving world economic activity in 1993, this will be 'largely in the
second half. In important areas such as construction, automobile production
and many capital goods sectors, however, activity will remain below the
peaks of the late 1980s, even as we go into 1994'.

The German cartel office wants to look at the links between Westdeutsche

stakes in the leading travel agency chain Touristik Union International,
Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
Mr Hubertus Schon of the Berlin-based watchdog said it had asked for
evidence about the influence Germany's third biggest bank on its 34-per cent

He said problems of competition could arise if the acquisition resulted in
TUI having greater access than other tour arrangers to LTU, Germany's

FT  20 OCT 92 / The Coal Crisis: Unions to fight on against closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and CATHY MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE UNIONS plan to go ahead with demonstrations against the government's
coal programme in spite of concessions on some of the pits originally due to
be axed.
Miners' leaders said they would press ahead with a lobby of parliament and a
demonstration tomorrow. The TUC has no plans to cancel a protest rally in
London on Sunday.
TUC general secretary Mr Norman Willis described Mr Michael Heseltine's
announcement as a 'massive climbdown on tactics', but one which made little
difference to policy.
Mr Willis said: 'There is no genuine moratorium. All the miners have got is
a stay of execution.'
Mr Frank Cave, vice-president of the National Union of Mineworkers and
leader of the Yorkshire pitmen, said miners would fight to keep the pits
open.
Mr Dave Hopper, NUM secretary in the North East dismissed the announcement
as a bid to head off a parliamentary revolt by Tory backbenchers.
Mr Hopper said: 'It gives us time to step up our opposition and we will
continue our fight with increased vigour. We will not be satisfied until the
government and British Coal backs down completely.'
Mr Jimmy Airlie, the AEEU electrical and engineering union's executive
council member with responsibility for the nuclear industry, said: 'The
government had no energy policy before Heseltine got up to speak and it had
no energy policy after he sat down. We need a proper in-depth review. Even
Tory backbenchers are saying it is too little too late.'
Mr Bill Morris, general secretary of the TGWU transport unionm, described Mr
Heseltine's announcement as 'not the U-turn the country needs', appealing to
unionists and 'all people of goodwill' to maintain pressure on the
government.
Mr John Edmonds, general secretary of the GMB general union - one of the
unions representing white-collar workers in British Coal and power workers -
said that Mr Heseltine had 'missed the point' and called on the government
to draw up a 'planned energy policy.'
In spite of union defiance, Mr Heseltine's announcement could undermine the
TUC's attempt to assemble a broad coalition against the pit closures.
However, mining communities last night pursued plans for local rallies
against the government's programme.
A Labour MP, Mr Kevin Baron, predicted a community campaign to oppose the
planned pit closures.

THE Press Complaints Com-mission argues today that self-regulation of the
newspaper industry is now working effectively. The claim is made in evidence
sent to Sir David Calcutt, who is investigating the performance of press
self-regulation.
The commission was set up last year following the Calcutt report into press
behaviour.
The PCC says that the number of complaints is tiny compared with the number
of words printed in newspapers.

FT  19 OCT 92 / TUC aims to keep up the pressure: Unions set u group to
co-ordinate opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress hopes to keep up the pressure on the government by
assembling the broadest possible coalition against the planned pit closures.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, hopes to meet Tory MPs and Anglican
bishops, and the TUC's parliamentary lobbying effort - established to combat
the next Employment Bill - will be in full swing.
Yesterday a demonstration in Cheltenham against the closures attracted the
support of 3,000 people including many prominent Conservatives and Socialist
Workers party supporters. Mr Tony Hilder, an executive member of the
rightwing Freedom Association, marched alongside Mr Quentin Tallon, chairman
of the Cheltenham Trades Union Council.
Mr John Monks, the deputy general secretary of the TUC, said last night:
'There is a mood similar to 1979, the feeling that a particular approach to
running the economy has failed and that we need a change.' The TUC has set
up a 10-strong committee to guide the campaign against pit closures and
unemployment in general, and has started a fighting fund with a donation of
Pounds 50,000. Some of that will probably be used for newspaper
advertisements.
A new issue in the campaign could be the future of British Coal's Pounds
1bn-plus pension fund surplus. TUC officials say they fear that the
government may try to divert some of the surplus to cover the costs of
redundancy payments.
An attempt will also be made today to involve the European Commission when
Mr Roger Lyons, chairman of the TUC's energy committee, meets EC energy
officials to discuss whether the UK electricity generators have breached
European competition policy. Meanwhile, in London, unions representing
workers in the nuclear power industry are expected to express their
solidarity with the miners.
After a lobby of parliament and demonstrations led by the mining unions on
Wednesday, the TUC is hoping that at least 100,000 people will attend a
rally in Trafalgar Square the following Sunday. Civil Service union leaders
are planning to write directly to all their members encouraging them to
attend.
Two tonnes of coal were yesterday dumped outside Mr Michael Heseltine's
country home near Banbury, Oxfordhsire, by miners, blocking the drive.
Police said the miners could face charges of criminal damage if the gate was
damaged.

FT  19 OCT 92 / King Arthur tries to court public opinion: A change of
emphasis by the NUM leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arthur Scargill, president of the National Union of Mineworkers, accuses
the government of exacting a terrible revenge on the mining industry. But he
is taking his own small revenge on Conservative ministers by failing to
provide his usual cameo performance as the stilted demagogue hell-bent on
bringing down the government.
Mindful of the lack of industrial muscle that his own activists now have, Mr
Scargill is addressing a wider audience - the British public - and that
requires different language and better manners.
Mr Scargill spoke last week after an NUM delegate conference in Sheffield
more about the costs to taxpayers of closing the mines than about class
solidarity. He even said he did not want a strike.
On Saturday, addressing the TUC general council, union leaders said that
finger-wagging demands for solidarity had disappeared.
Instead he made an impressive presentation of the economic case for coal and
rounded it off with a moving story about a miner who has moved house and pit
six times in the past six years.
His tone has been, if anything, more conciliatory than that of Mr Roy Lynk,
leader of the moderate breakaway Union of Democratic Mineworkers, now
sitting-in 1,200 feet down Silverhill colliery.
With seven out of 11 Nottinghamshire pits due to close, Mr Lynk believes he
has been betrayed by the government and fears that his members may vote him
out of office in November. Mr Scargill's apparent willingness to accept
advice from others may also have something to do with his own re-election,
required no later than January. Some Scargill-watchers detect more than just
a change of style. They say he is quieter, less cocksure, readier to listen
 -as if his 'martyrdom' has given him an inner assurance that he used to
lack.
He laughs at such a notion. 'You can say what you like, I know that I
haven't changed,' he insists, 'but the issues have been finally understood
by the British people.'
He does say that, so as not to alienate too many people, he has deliberately
avoided saying 'I told you so', but he rejects the idea that popularity - or
at least acceptance - from the media and public is a new experience. 'I was
popular in 1972 and 1974,' he recalls.
So is he really the same old Arthur just responding to new political
realities? Those realities were drummed home earlier last week at a private
meeting with other union leaders and members of his own executive which
appear to have convinced Mr Scargill of the need for pragmatism.
Some things certainly don't change. In London and Sheffield last week Mr
Scargill visibly glowed in the face of media coverage. Some of it, from
sectors of the press normally allied to the Conservative party, would have
been inconceivable just a few months ago. The coverage emphasised the plight
of the threatened mining communities rather than any suggestion that Mr
Scargill had embarked on round four of his attempt to bring down a
Conservative government.
Mr Scargill, although subdued, is acting like a man who believes himself to
be on the point of being vindicated by history: his predictions about pit
closures are coming true and the current campaign is showing signs of
generating precisely the kind of popular feeling against the government that
evaded the NUM during the 1984-85 miners'strike.
Outside the NUM conference in Sheffield there were no longer young miners
shouting their support with football chants and the delegates pointedly
refused to sign petitions for a general strike.
If it does come to a strike ballot the union will be hoping to secure a Yes
vote on the grounds that influencing public opinion has proved inadequate.
Many miners will fear losing their redundancy pay - considerably less
generous than it was before 1987 but better than nothing. The union,
however, will be arguing that British Coal is not entitled to strip away all
but the statutory requirement as a result of such action. The union will
also be pointing to the radical change in working practices demanded of
those who stay in the privatised industry.
In that event the old belligerent Arthur Scargill will probably make a
return.
He showed in Chesterfield on Saturday night that he has not disappeared
completely. He defended the decision not to hold a strike ballot in 1984,
saying that the miners and the British people wanted a new government and
blaming the 'Tory-sponsored' UDM for the 'mess we are now in'.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Challenge to become competitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK RADCLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Ms Rebecca Breeze (Letter, October 12) is right in saying that by
adopting the right attitudes to our current problems we have the power to
influence Britain's economic future.
The Confederation of British Industry believes a strong UK manufacturing
industry of adequate size is the only solution to the wealth generation,
investment and employment needed to give us a sustainable standard of
living. Manufacturers recognise that with a more competitive value for
sterling they now have an opportunity to sell more products both at home and
overseas.
British consumers will buy British goods when these are clearly shown to be
superior in price, design, performance, delivery, and after-sales service.
Those who buy foreign goods presumably think the British goods are not
competitive. Therein lies the challenge.
That challenge is already being addressed by the CBI's national
manufacturing council, set up at the beginning of this year with
representatives of 50 leading British firms, to explore how the standards of
average UK firms can be brought up to those of the very best. The council
will be producing its recommendations in a report to be published at the
CBI's national conference on November 8. It will set out what needs to be
done to ensure that we invent, design, make and sell more products that are
better than, or at least as good as, those of our best overseas competitors.
Increasing globalisation of business means that to be fully competitive we
must achieve world class standards. That requires a partnership - not just
between manufacturers, financiers and government, but involving everyone in
the UK if we are to achieve true success. Mark Radcliffe,
deputy director-general,

</HEADLINE>

Hotels are forever seeking new ways to offer customers a little bit extra,
such as folding the tongue sticking out of the box of tissues. But a
colleague visiting Geneva was still surprised to find, among the peanuts and
chocolates in his room's minibar, a box of condoms.
The Swiss Movenpick group, which owns the hotel, said they were there not as
a marketing ploy, but as a response to increasing concern about Aids.
Indeed, whether to supply them is left to the conscience of each individual
hotel's management. So thrifty travellers who keep themselves in shampoo and
bath oil as a by-product of their globe-trotting, cannot count on a
Movenpick group booking to yield a further cost-saving collectable.
Nevertheless, in the future perhaps, hotel guides will have some appropriate
symbol to denote whether the additional feature is included.

THE Angolan government yesterday accused the main opposition party Unita of
planning to seize the south and partition the country, Reuter reports from
Luanda.
Governor Baltasar Manuel, of the southern city of Huambo, where former rebel
leader Mr Jonas Savimbi retreated after the elections, said Unita was
preparing for partition by deploying forces in Huambo and other cities. The
government demanded Unita withdraw its forces under international
supervision.
The ruling MPLA party has reported Unita troop movements in Bie and Moxico
provinces east of Huambo, with Unita controlling some towns. Unita has said
it is unhappy with parliamentary elections in which the MPLA won 124 seats
against 67 for itself.
In the capital Luanda, at least two people were killed when Unita men fired
on MPLA supporters.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish auto-motive group, is losing SKr2bn (Dollars 368m)
annually and is preparing a crisis package to cut production capacity, Mr
Soren Gyll, chief executive, said.
The package incudes closing two of Volvo's three Swedish car assembly plants
and reducing costs by matching supply more closely with demand. The board
will consider the contraction programme next month.
Mr Gyll also says Volvo cannot afford to increase wages next year. The
company's finances deteriorated this autumn, although had not been affected
by the turbulence on the international exchanges. In August, Volvo reported
an operating losses of Skr835m for the first six months.
Mr Gyll told local business leaders in Gothenburg that even if the whole of
Volvo's car assembly production in Sweden were concentrated at its
Gothenburg plant, it would still suffer over-capacity. This was because
demand for its models in the domestic market had fallen by two-thirds.
'The good times at the end of the 1980's will not return,' he said.
MODO, the Swedish forestry group, suffered a SKr811m loss (after financial
items) for the first eight months of the year. This contrasts with a SKr311m
profit in the same period of 1991.
In the second four months of the year, the loss increased to SKr476m from
the SKr335m deficit made in the January to April period.
In a forecast for the rest of 1992, Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive, said
unsettling market conditions would continue and this would mean a continuing
large deficit for MoDo.
TRELLEBORG, the Swedish mining and industrial group, made a small profit
(after financial items) of SKr11m for the first eight months of the year,
compared with a SKr680m profit for the same period in 1991.
Sales rose slightly to SKr14.96bn from SKr14.11bn, but this was due to the
consolidation of its acquisition of Munksjo at the end of last year.
UNIDANMARK, Denmark's second-largest banking group, said it would issue a
statement to the stock exchange today following a television report claiming
it plans to dismiss 15 per cent of its staff, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
The bank expects to incur losses of about DKr2bn (Dollars 357m) this year.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Storehouse in talks for sale of
Habitat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOREHOUSE, the UK retailing group, is negotiating the sale of Habitat, its
home furnishing chain, to Ikea, the Swedish furniture retailer.
Talks are also being held with Sears, the retail and mail order group, which
is understood to be interested in buying Richards, the Storehouse women's
wear business.
City analysts estimate the two deals could raise up to Pounds 70m for
Storehouse, though the negotiations have yet to resolve a number of 'issues
of substance', according to one source.
Habitat, founded by Sir Terence Conran, was one of the high street successes
of the 1960s and early 1970s. Its cheap, well-designed furnishings
epitomised the lifestyle of young professional people.
It failed, however, to keep pace with the retail revolution it helped to
create. In the past two years, it has closed a quarter of its UK stores and
losses have amounted to more than Pounds 20m.
Habitat's French operations, in which Au Printemps, the French retailer, was
recently reported to be interested, are profitable; but the US business lost
Pounds 7.7m last year.
Ikea has prospered in the UK since it opened its first superstore at
Warrington five years ago. It was ranked the country's sixth largest
furniture retailer last year despite having just three stores. Since then,
it has opened a fourth at Gateshead, and is due to open another at Croydon
next month. Its out-of-town stores, with facilities such as children's
playgrounds and family restaurants, represented 'what Habitat might have
been,' said one analyst.
Storehouse declined to comment on the Habitat disposal yesterday but Mr
David Dworkin, who became chief executive of Storehouse in July, has
indicated that the core of the group's future operations would be BhS and
Mothercare, each serving mass markets in clothing.
Storehouse, which showed signs of recovery with pre-tax profits of Pounds
15.8m last year, is expected to register a small loss during the first half
of the current year.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: MGN agrees plan over Donohue
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIRROR GROUP Newspapers is close to realising a lot of the value of its
holding in Donohue, the loss-making Canadian forest products group.
MGN reached an agreement with Quebecor, the controlling shareholder in
Donohue, over the weekend for a series of transactions that would tidy up
another small part of the empire of the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
If all goes according to plan it is estimated that MGN will at least clear
the book value of the Donohue stake which in June 1992 was in the newspaper
group's accounts at Pounds 38.5m.
MGN at present has a 49 per cent stake in a private Canadian company,
Mercor, whose sole asset is a 53.8 per cent holding in Donohue, a company
with a market capitalisation of Pounds 225m. The controlling stake in Mercor
is held by Quebecor, the Canadian publishing and printing group. The stake
dates back to 1987 when Mr Maxwell set up a joint venture with Quebecor.
Under the deal Donohue is offering to exchange its existing 20 vote shares
for new Donohue shares with only one vote in return for a 12 per cent
premium of new shares. The aim is to allow Mercor through Quebecor to retain
voting control of Donohue without MGN. The 12 per cent premium will mainly
come from shares now held by MGN.
Following the offer Donohue and Mercor will offer for sale 6m units, each
containing a share and a warrant to buy a share. This would be made up of
new shares issued by Donohue and the existing MGN shares in Mercor.
Mercor will pay MGN the proceeds and if warrants are not exercised MGN will
own directly Donohue shares reserved for the warrants. After the public
issue MGN will hold directly between 1.78m and 2.34m Donohue shares which
can be sold six months after completion.
The MGN board says the transaction should give the company greater
flexibility to dispose of its Donohue stake. If the public issue is
completed it would 'provide for an early disposal of a substantial part of
MGN's interest.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTRACTS valued at over Pounds 10.4m have been won by Mowlem Northern Civil
Enginering, a region of JOHN MOWLEM CONSTRUCTION.
The largest - at Pounds 2.5m - is for a new water reclamation works for
Severn Trent Water, at Shirebrook near Mansfield.
The Leeds office is handling the contract, which is in two parts. The first
52 weeks will see the construction of inlet works, sedimentation tanks,
filter beds, humus tanks, storm tanks and ancillary pumping chambers and
pipework. After mechanical engineers have been on site, Mowlem will return
for a further 10-week period to demolish the existing works.
The Bromborough office has begun work on a Pounds 2m contract for Cereal
Partners, a joint venture between Nestle and General Foods. Refurbishment of
the existing 6,500 sq metre food processing plan at Port Causeway,
Bromborough, on the A41 will be complemented by the construction of an
adjacent 1,000 sq metre dispatch building complete with docking facilities
and dust proofing.
The Bromborough office has won a Pounds 1.9m contract from North West Water,
a Pounds 1m contract from Welsh Water and a Pounds 700,000 contract from
Seven Trent Water.
In addition a Pounds 2m contract for a pumping station at Saltcoats,
Ayshire, has been awarded to the Kilsyth office by Strathclyde Regional
Council.
A second contract won by Kilsyth is for the construction of a relief sewer
near Musselburgh race course, valued at Pounds 355,00 for Lothian regional
council.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (10): 'We
think for our clients' - Profile of S G Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRIAN BOLLEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS fair to say that while S G Warburg is universally respected, it is not
necessarily liked. The widespread image of the firm as grey and faceless is
partly a function of its preferred approach to publicity, which is to avoid
personalising it. Professionalism, team spirit and a rejection of the star
system characterise Warburgs, combined with continuity, consistency,
consensus and discretion about clients' business.
The firm has come a long way since it was founded in 1946, and is arguably
Britain's only truly successful wholly integrated international investment
bank house. The group employs more than 5,000 people worldwide and derives
only 40 per cent of its revenues from domestic UK business. The
international bias owes much to the founder's status as a parvenu to the
City and the need to look for business elsewhere, particularly to North
America.
Broadly speaking, Warburgs takes a holistic approach to servicing clients.
In 1991, it announced it had combined its corporate advisory and financing
activities in order to market and provide corporate services more
effectively to clients worldwide. Corporate advisory and financing teams are
based throughout Europe, in the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain,
Switzerland and Portugal. There is a significant presence in both North
America and south-east Asia.
One of the more public results of the firm's integrated approach has been
its involvement in privatisation transactions around the world in leading
corporate advisory and distribution roles. It has acted for companies or
government agencies in more than 20 countries.
This breadth of experience has helped in cross-border transactions, but has
also enabled the firm to grow local roots to the point where it is now
involved in a large number of purely domestic transactions overseas.
For example, last year it advised on the merger between Spain's two largest
private sector electricity utilities, Iberduero and Hidroelectrica Espanola,
and on Nationale Nederlanden's merger with NMB Postbank.
More recent important transactions include the privatisation of Sidermex,
the Mexican government-controlled steel and mining group sold to a
consortium of Mexican and other investors, and the sale of a 60 per cent
interest in SyStemix of the US to Switzerland's Sandoz, one of the largest
transactions in the biotechnology industry to date.
Warburgs is enjoying a good year in M&amp;A so far. Its role in advising Midland
Bank on the merger with Hongkong and Shanghai Bank helped it to a near-clean
sweep of the FT Mergers + Acquisitions International league tables at the
half-year stage.
Currently it is sole adviser to UK publisher Reed International, a client of
more than 20 years' standing, in one of the biggest deals of 1992 so far,
the proposed Pounds 5bn-plus merger with Dutch publisher Elsevier. For
director Rodney Ward, a financing specialist, the involvement in this very
1990s agreed strategy-driven deal illustrates several of the firm's
strengths. Client relationships, flexibility, country and industry knowledge
all came to bear as well as the quality of the advisory team in coming up
with a creative structure.
At Warburgs, industry knowledge comes from having a large research
capability. The particular areas where it feels expansion or consolidation
are likely include financial services, telecommunications, publishing,
property, retailing, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, motors, oil and gas and
engineering.
Mr Ward says: 'Networking through the analysts you can get a view not only
of what's happening in any one industry in the UK but right across the world
and it gives you a sense, a view and a vision that not many people can
match. More and more, companies are looking to their advisers to provide
them with more than just pure boiler plate advice but to be actively
thinking on their behalf. We aim to be in the forefront of the provision of
those ideas.'
Warburgs is not immune to its recession, as its recent exit from market
making for a number of smaller companies illustrated. 'We are bound up with
the fate of our clients and the nature and volume of the work changes,' says
Mr Mark Nicholls, director with day-to-day responsibility for corporate
advice in the UK.
Mr Ward argues that the firm's spread does give some insulation, with Latin
America proving more buoyant than elsewhere, but there have been deferrals
in the UK and Europe. The privatisation of Procordia, in which Warburgs is
advising the Swedish government, now looks unlikely to take place before
1993, thanks to market uncertainty. Meanwhile, work is being sought in other
areas; a lot of people do need financial restructuring advice.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (5): Keen to forge alliances /
Profile of Montedison, world leader in plastics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVER since a team of scientists in Ferrara discovered polypropylene (PP) 30
years ago, Ferruzzi-Montedison, the Italian food and chemicals company, has
dominated the world's production of this widely-used plastic.
As a result of funding the team's research, led by the Nobel Prize winner
Professor Giulio Natta, the Italian group was able to invent the best
technological processes for the production of PP.
Himont, the group's chemicals subsidiary, is the world's leading producer of
PP, accounting for about 16 per cent of the world's capacity of 16m tonnes a
year. It is also estimated that about 60 per cent of the world's PP
capacity, existing and planned, is based on Himont's licences.
Himont's production process for PP, under the trademark Spheripol, is
generally accepted as the best in the world. Using this process, the plastic
is produced in little balls, making it more malleable than when it is
produced in
Himont has adapted its highly-efficient Spheripol process to produce
polyethylene (PE), under the trademark Spherilene. Of all the
polyolefin-based materials, PE is produced in the greatest volume. But PP is
increasingly being substituted for PE, especially in packaging materials.
Ferruzzi-Montedison is keen to hold on to its leading position in plastics
but it is looking for alliances with its competitors in order to share the
investment in research and development, and the high fixed costs of plants
and
In September, Montecatini, the subsidiary which co-ordinates
Ferruzzi-Montedison's chemical, pharmaceutical and energy activities, and
Shell Chemicals, part of the Anglo-Dutch oil group, announced a proposal to
merge their activities in PP and PE.
The proposal, which needs approval from the European Commission because it
would link Europe's largest PP producers with a combined capacity of 3m
tonnes, appears to be a perfect fit. Montecatini has only modest PE
production capacity - it has a plant in Texas with annual production
capacity of some 10,000 tons and it is building another in Louisiana with
capacity of 200,000 tons. But Shell already has production capacity of
500,000 tons, using Montecatini's Spherilene licence.
Mr Carlo Sama, the managing director of Montedison, is keen to find further
alliances for Montecatini's other chemicals and pharmaceuticals activities,
mainly to reduce the company's high debt - mostly the result of series of
acquisitions in recent years.
The group's net debt-equity ratio has jumped from 0.88 at the end of 1991 to
1.06 by June 30 this year, but the company intends, through these alliances,
to halve this by the end of 1993 by continuing to cut costs and jobs, and
through the sale of non-strategic real estate and minority stakes.
As a result of the re-organisation of the Ferruzzi-Montedison group and the
merger of Eridania with its French sister, Beghin-Say, its earnings are now
better protected against the cyclical chemicals sector.
In 1991, food accounted for 64.7 per cent of total sales of L15,732bn and 54
per cent of gross operating profit of L1,828bn. By contrast, chemicals
accounted for 20.7 per cent of sales and 19.9 per cent of gross operating
profit.
Ferruzzi-Montedison is now one of the leading producers of sugar, edible
oils and starch in Europe, with particular strength in Italy, France and
Spain.
At the same time Ferruzzi-Montedison is investing in research and
development to find further industrial uses for its agricultural products.
It has developed the technology to produce a diesel fuel from soya,
sunflower and rapeseed oils.
The fuel provides the same performance as traditional diesel, but it
pollutes less, producing only half as much exhaust emissions, and no
sulphur. The distribution of 'Diesel-Bi' is still at an initial stage,
though it is being used by buses and taxis in several European cities,
including Florence, Genoa, Zurich and Freiburg.
Montedison is building a plant with capacity of 60,000 tonnes in Livorno,
which should be in operation by the end of the year. The cost of producing
this environmentally-friendly diesel is more expensive than traditional
diesel, mainly because of the lack of economy of scale, but because it is
not taxed, the cost to the consumer is the same.
The group has also discovered a way to make a bio-degradable thermo-plastic
material from corn starch. This plastic will only be used in niche areas,
such as in the production of nappies, sanitary towels and other hygiene
products, as well as the production of large plastic sheets to protect
farmers' crops in winter.
While these innovations are important from a technological point of view, it
will be many years before they make a significant contribution to profits.
However, government plans partially to privatise the Italian energy industry
could well boost the company's earning power.
Edison, which consolidates the group's energy activities, is Italy's largest
private producer of electricity, with 21 hydro-electric power stations and
two thermo-electric power stations in northern Italy. At present Edison only
generates energy for internal use, but a change in the law would allow it to
sell excess output to Enel, the state electrical authority.

FT  19 OCT 92 / The European Market: E Europe entices the bold -
Expansionist western retailers face rough ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR western retailers the nascent consumer markets of eastern Europe are
tempting the bold and taunting the wary.
The prospect of converting 400m eager consumers into loyal shoppers is
encouraging many retailers to invest in the region. But the drawbacks of
exposing themselves in countries with low incomes and uncertain prospects
are growing more evident by the day as the former Yugoslavia disintegrates
further and hyper-inflation stalks the region.
In a report published today the consultants Corporate Intelligence Group
attempt to analyse and assess the collective experience of the western
retailers who have pioneered investment in eastern Europe.
'The lesson is that no one has had an easy ride, and if you are going into
the region do not expect one. But the companies we talked to were
universally optimistic about the long term,' said Mr Clive Grant, one of the
report's authors.
About 90 western retailers have invested in eastern Europe, although some
ventures amount to little more than attempts to test the water. However, 40
companies have begun trading in more than one country, with the total number
of separate retail operations reaching 181.
German companies have been the most active investors, accounting for a third
of western retail operations in eastern Europe. Austrian retailers have also
moved quickly into the market - often re-establishing trading links with
businesses that existed before communism took over.
Following some way behind in investment terms are retailers from the US,
Canada, UK, France and Italy.
'It is clear that there is a pull factor operating here,' Mr Grant said.
'Retailers say they cannot afford not to be there; to wait would be too
late. But there is also a push factor in that many western companies are
seeking to escape the restraints of saturated home markets.'
Retailing investments come in many forms, ranging from joint ventures, to
franchising and acquisitions.
One of the most interesting approaches comes from ComputerLand, the
Californian-based computer retailer, which has opened 25 franchised outlets
in the region, including seven in Russia.
The company found it difficult to find suitable local franchisees and had to
call on a Russian emigre already working for ComputerLand in the US to open
its first Russian stores. It has also had problems finding suitable sites
and has had to open showrooms in a Moscow hotel lobby and on the eighth
floor of an office building in Warsaw.
In spite of the obstacles, ComputerLand believes it can entrench itself in
the region's rapidly developing computer markets and secure a strong
foothold for long-term growth.
Other western companies are trying to implement the same strategy in other
retail sectors. For example, the Swedish Ikea group has invested heavily in
five furniture stores in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, while Ahold,
the Dutch food retailing group, is developing the Mana supermarket chain in
Czechoslovakia where it now has 11 stores.
German retailers such as Tengelmann, Quelle and Otto Versand are also
gearing themselves up for significant expansion in eastern Europe.
K-Mart, the US discount retailer, is likely to invest up to Dollars 100m
(Pounds 58.1m) over the next three years developing its profile in
Czechoslovakia. In May K-Mart bought a 76 per cent stake in the MAJ
department store in the heart of Prague and is negotiating to buy another 11
stores.
The CIG report highlights the substantial differences between national
markets and suggests that Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland offer the most
attractive opportunities - in the short term, at least.
The Hungarian retail sector has proved particularly dynamic. Between 1986
and 1991 the number of shops doubled to 112,600, with the private sector's
share of retail outlets climbing from 37 per cent to 60 per cent. However,
the foreign share of the domestic market is estimated to have grown above 20
per cent - triggering local discontent.
Other challenges confronting western retailers in the region include
bureaucratic delays, an unpredictable and rapidly changing legal and
commercial framework, cultural and linguistic complications, the pervasive
influence of the black market, and difficulties in establishing title to
properties.
Although the risks may appear high, CIG says that retailers entering the
region initially face lower levels of local competition than they do when
moving into markets in more developed countries.
As for the longer term, the report suggests one of the most fascinating
features of the eastern European retail scene will be to see how western
retailers react as they compete against each other directly for the first
time on neutral ground.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Polls rejuvenate Brazil's radicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the banners in Brazil's multi-party demonstrations for the
impeachment of President Fernando Collor, the most visible was the red flag.
The radical Workers party (PT) has since collected its reward, emerging from
this month's municipal elections as the clear beneficiary of the impeachment
campaign.
Moribund since narrowly losing the presidential elections in 1989 and
floundering in its search for a post-cold war popular platform, the PT was
sparked into action by corruption charges against Mr Collor. Under the new
banner of 'Ethics in Politics' it was at the forefront of protests and its
members the most vocal in the congressional inquiry into government
corruption.
Its actions paid off. In the first round of voting in municipal elections
the PT won one state capital straight off and goes on to the November
run-off in five others including four of the country's most important
cities: Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte and Porto Alegre. Rio was
the biggest surprise: Ms Benedita da Silva, the PT's black, female
candidate, topped the poll - the first time the party has broken into the
city.
Mr Lus Inacio da Silva ('Lula'), the party's founder and leader, now seems
certain to be a hot contender in the 1994 presidential elections (or
parliamentary if the political system is changed in next year's referendum).
It is a radical reversal from a few months ago. Demoralised by coming so
close to the presidency and then losing, and by the collapse of socialism in
eastern Europe, Lula, a former union leader from Sao Paulo, had practically
dropped out of politics for most of the Collor era. In the 1990
congressional elections the party won only 35 seats in the 503-member house.
The popular acceptance of Mr Collor's modernisation programme to open the
economy and reduce the role of the state seemed to spell the death knell for
the PT, which advocates the opposite. Half-hearted demonstrations with CUT,
its union arm, to try to block the first sell-off last year were a failure,
and today workers are calling for their companies to be privatised.
Mr Renato Bosch, a political science professor at Rio university, believes
the revival demonstrated by the municipal election results is more than a
short-term phenomenon. 'The party has changed a lot and is strengthening
independent of recent events. It has become far more diversified, aiming at
salaried workers in general, not just blue-collar workers.'

A REBELLION in South Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal party (DLP) appears
to be faltering after a key political figure refused to support party
dissidents.
Mr Park Tae-joon, the former head of the DLP's main faction, said at the
weekend he would not join a new conservative political party being formed by
the DLP rebels.
Mr Park ignited the DLP's internal crisis a week ago when he resigned as the
party's co-chairman.
His resignation reflected growing dissatisfaction among the main faction
supporters of President Roh Tae-woo about Mr Kim Young-sam, the party's new
leader and candidate in the December presidential election.
Mr Park's departure from the DLP precipitated the resignation of two dozen
other senior party officials and MPs. They said they would form a new party
to oppose Mr Kim, who is now the leading candidate in the presidential
election.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Waigel welcomes pay restraint offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Theo Waigel, German finance minister, has welcomed the offer from the
country's most powerful union to hold back pay rises for five years to no
more than is required to maintain purchasing power.
'The longer we have to plan ahead the better for creating jobs and
manoeuvring room for investment,' Mr Waigel told a Sunday newspaper.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of I G Metall, offered the pay pact under a
solidarity accord designed to place financing of German unification on a
sounder footing. But he insisted that the burdens of reunification should
not just fall on wage earners.
Mr Steinkuhler has reaffirmed the union's opposition to changing the
constitution to make it more difficult to seek asylum in Germany. He said it
was possible to prevent the widespread abuse of Germany's liberal asylum
laws without changing the constitution.
The German Social Democrats are divided on the issue and I G Metall's
support for the status quo could make it even more difficult for SPD leaders
to force change on a reluctant rank and file.
But Mr Steinkuhler sees his union as an unofficial opposition. 'Governments
come and go but the unions are always here. Governments, and oppositions,
have to run after the opinion polls, but we can help shape opinion,' he said
in an interview.
He also expressed growing scepticism about the Maastricht treaty. The union
supports the treaty, with reservations, but Mr Steinkuhler believes it would
be unlikely to pass if there was a German referendum. He also said were
growing doubts about the need for monetary union, some of which he shared.
'I'm not sure if it is a necessary precondition of economic union,' he said.
Without a stronger social dimension he believed Maastricht would fail and
that the social dimension had been 'nothing but promises'.
Mr Waigel says he will leave himself time to find the best way to comply
with a court ruling which has ordered the government to increase personal
income tax allowances by 1996, Reuter adds from Bonn.
'We have time until January 1996 to find a truly comprehensive and workable
solution,' Mr Waigel said yesterday.
In a judgment that could force big changes in Germany's tax system, the
Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe has ruled that the government had to give
higher tax breaks to people on lower incomes.
As the ruling made no refund provision, it is unlikely to have an impact on
Germany's budget. But the court said that transitional arrangements would
have to be made to ease the tax burden on the poor between 1993 and 1996.

THE US and its Nato partners must not let the struggling Atlantic military
alliance die in their preoccupation with post-cold war domestic problems, Mr
Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Gleneagles, Scotland.
'We can't let that atrophy,' he said on his flight from Washington for a
two-day Nuclear Planning Group (NPG) meeting of Nato defence ministers
beginning tomorrow.
Mr Cheney said he was not surprised by shrinking allied military budgets and
Western Europe's bitter fight over new economic and political unity.
But east Europe and the former Soviet Union were rife with violent political
unrest. 'It is incumbent on us to remind the voters and one another we
should not ignore the long-term importance of the alliance and of a set of
meaningful relationships. By meaningful, I mean US and alliance forces
committed to an integrated command, prepared when necessary to use that
force to promote our interests.'

FT  19 OCT 92 / Riot police deployed in Cairo

<TEXT>
RIOT POLICE were deployed in force near main government buildings and
embassies in Cairo yesterday following a night of disturbances in the city's
inner suburbs.
The protests, fuelled by frustration among thousands of homeless people over
perceived slow official reaction to last week's earthquake, carried ominous
overtones for the government, which has been under increasing pressure from
Islamic extremists.
Police sealed a main thoroughfare through the slum suburb of Boulaq and
fired teargas at stone-throwing youths. A bridge across the Nile was
partially closed to prevent protesters crossing into the Zamalek area where
many senior officials live.
Most worrying for the authorities were the angry chants directed against
President Hosni Mubarak as well as the conspicuous role of various Islamic
groups.
Hundreds demonstrated on Saturday, near the Shura Council, the upper house
of the parliament. 'Mubarak, you have to collect your shame and get your
children off the streets,' people shouted. 'Where have you been Mubarak -
you went asking for aid and came back to us with a few bars of soap.' Mr
Mubarak, who cut short a visit to China to oversee the relief effort,
defended his government at a press conference on Saturday.
'I think the government since this problem started has done its maximum,' he
said. But conceded there had been shortcomings in providing assistance.
'The lesson for the Egyptians and the government and all the authorities in
this country is just to try to educate the people how to react whenever
there is any emergency,' he said.
Over 500 people were killed and some 6,000 injured in the earthquake.
Government estimates put total losses at about Dollars 300m, with 8,000
structures destroyed or rendered unsafe.
The ruling National Democratic party has been unnerved by the speed with
which Islamic groups mobilised to help people in distress. Within hours of
Monday's disaster, Islamic charitable organisations had established relief
centres in poor and crumbling neighbourhoods, hardest hit by the earthquake.
They wasted no time in providing funds for the destitute and help for
families made homeless, in marked contrast to official efforts.
The Islamic mainstream Moslem Brotherhood and more overtly militant
religious groups have been mounting a spirited challenge to the government
for the hearts and minds of Egypt's 57m people, many of whom live in
poverty.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Forgings group warns of redundancies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF deliveries of forged products for the mining industry drop by more than
10 per cent, Mills Forgings of Coventry 'will have to think of
redundancies', Mr John Simon, chairman, warned yesterday.
Mills, one of the smaller forges, is exceptional for its concentration of
customers in the mining industry. About 30 per cent of its production goes
to three engineering groups for use in the manufacture of mining equipment.
These groups, which supply British Coal and companies abroad, are still
assessing the likely effect of the pit closures.
The mining industry is the forging industry's biggest customer after the
automotive sector, buying products such as coal cutters, props and
conveyors.
Last year the mining industry bought 6,337 tonnes of steel forgings - or
nearly 4 per cent of total production.
This year deliveries to the mining industry have matched those of last year
and have therefore become relatively more important for the industry. Total
production is running at 13 per cent below last year's level, according to
Mr David Powis, director-general of the British Forging Industry
Association.
Uncertainty about the future is also felt at United Forgemasters of Warley,
West Midlands.
About 10 per cent of the company's forgings go, directly and indirectly, to
the mining industry and half of that proportion is exported. But the fear of
Mr Jim Mundell, United Forgemasters chairman, is that the demise of the
British pits may induce the company's customers to withdraw from the supply
of mining equipment.

CONSUMERS will soon be able to make more accurate comparisons among credit
card company charges following a deal between leading card suppliers.
The Association for Payment Clearing Services said it had agreed a method to
allow consumers to take into account the effect that up-front charges on
credit cards have on annual percentage rates (APR), the interest rate paid
on outstanding balances.
The differences arose when annual fees were first introduced on credit cards
almost three years ago. Before then the annual cost of a card was simply the
monthly interest rate compounded over 12 months.

The company, PrimeShare International, says many sellers and buyers of
existing timeshares are not protected by the new Timeshare Act, which came

from purchases and to claim their money back, provided the contract was

FT  19 OCT 92 / DTI role in travel collapse attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour party is pressing for an independent inquiry into the Department
of Trade and Industry's role in the affairs of Land Travel, the coach tour
operator, which collapsed in July, Philip Rawstorne writes.
A deputation of Labour MPs, led by Mr Nigel Griffiths, the party's consumer
spokesman, will meet Baroness Denton, consumer minister, tomorrow to present
evidence of 'gross incompetence and ministerial negligence' in the DTI's
handling of the case.
Yesterday Mr Griffiths said if an inquiry established that ministerial
action could have protected the 40,000 victims of the company's collapse,
they should receive compensation.
A review of Land Travel's accounts had shown that 'all the warning signs'
about the company's finances had been there since 1983, Mr Griffiths said.
Auditors had heavily qualified the company's accounts from 1983 and had
expressed fears that debts were unlikely to be recovered.
No dividends had been paid since 1983. Accounts had been filed late, and
switched between holding companies. Accounting periods had been changed four
times in five years.
Mr Edward Leigh, then consumer minister, had been alerted about the
company's situation in August 1991, Mr Griffiths claimed. 'If he had sent in
the DTI inspectors then, Land Travel would have been wound up, sparing up to
40,000 victims.'

FT  19 OCT 92 / Government rejects halt to closures: Heseltine admits
responsibility for pit turmoil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, yesterdaytook full
responsibility for the turmoil he had created among Tory MPs over plans to
shut 31 out of British Coals 50 pits. But he said there had been no
alternative to the closures.
He rejected the call by increasing numbers of Conservatives, the Trades
Union Congress and leading members of the clergy for a temporary halt to the
closures. 'I do not think there is a case for changing the recommendations
that I have made,' he said.
Looking tired after a gruelling week battling to persuade colleagues of both
the case for closure and the manner in which it is to be implemented, Mr
Heseltine repeated that contracts for only 40m tonnes of coal next year
could be expected from the electricity industry - 25m tonnes less than this
year.
Asked if there could be a moratorium on pit closures as demanded by many
Tory MPs, he replied: 'What am I to do with the 25m tonnes of coal?'
Mr Heseltine made no attempt to deny causing a fierce internal Tory revolt.
He did little to rebuff the suggestion that he had might have committed a
spectacular error of political judgment. 'If I am in that position, I accept
responsibility for that. I am the minister involved and I don't seek to
share the responsibility or run from it,' he said on the BBC's On the Record
programme.
But Mr Heseltine said it had been for British Coal to consult with the
unions and not for him to decide whether it was right not to give 90 days'
notice of redundancies to miners.
Mr Heseltine insisted that members of the cabinet, including Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, were
fully aware of the pit closures. He admitted, however, that Mr David Hunt,
the Welsh secretary, had not been brought into the picture soon enough over
the closure of three pits in Wales.
But he added that ministers from all government departments had been
discussing the closures 'for a considerable period of time'.
Asked about the future of his political career in his present post, Mr
Heseltine said: 'You don't come into politics expecting a sort of easy
ride.'
He said he did not expect the government to lose a Commons vote on the pit
closures on Wednesday in spite of unprecedented protests from Tory MPs.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Subsidy figure disputed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government's claim that keeping open the 31 pits due for closure would
cost taxpayers Pounds 100m a month is coming under increasing fire from
economists and, privately, from British Coal officials.
The figure, used repeatedly by ministers, is based on the assumption that if
British Coal can sell only 40m tonnes to the electricity generators next
year that will leave 2m tonnes a month - at a production cost of Pounds 50 a
tonne - unsold.
British Coal officials say the production cost is in fact considerably
lower, even at most of the 31 pits earmarked for closure. They also point
out that the Pounds 100m figure assumes that the coal could not be sold at
all, whereas it could be sold on the world market, albeit at somewhat below
its cost of production.
There would still be a monthly cost related to selling the coal but British
Coal officials insisted it would be far less than Pounds 100m. They also
point out that since the mid-1980s British Coal has received no operating
subsidy, although it still gets government money for redundancy packages and
related matters.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Sony coping with 12 headaches on VAT front in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs FOUCHER, WOODMANSEY and Ms CROCKFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, For 'VAT headache' (Editorial, October 13) please substitute '12 VAT
headaches'. Sony has 200 people throughout Europe trying to develop 12
reporting systems for VAT returns, European sales listings, and Intrastats
based on primary legislation in four states, draft legislation in five
states and no information at all in the remaining three (Italy, Belgium,
Portugal) - and all before January 1 1993.
Furthermore, we are told by our VAT advisers Price Waterhouse (London) that
there are a number of anomalies and differences in the various legislations:
EC free ports will be handled differently for VAT purposes (Southampton is
inside the EC, Copenhagen is outside); Germany and France want regional data
for Intrastats but the UK does not; and Spain does not currently allow
non-residents to register for VAT at all.
Even if we want to register some of our companies for VAT in the UK using a
fiscal representative, the forms are not yet available. To say nothing about
triangulation which accounts for 70 per cent of our European business and
which will lead to registration of our reinvoicing companies just about
everywhere. Even if the triangulation rules are simplified (to which France
still objects), it will leave almost no time to put them into effect.
Two further points. First, the EC Commission is not to blame for the complex
legislation. Simplification of the current rules was proposed some time ago
by the EC but rejected by some member states for fear of increased VAT
evasion. The reason for today's 'uncomfortable compromise' is the poor
consultation between European businesses, their elected representatives
(both locally and in Brussels) and the VAT authorities, resulting in
governments pursuing their own legislative interests rather than the
interests of businesses they represent. The open dialogue between UK and
Dutch customs and businesses provides two excellent European models in this
respect.
Second, we are advised that a VAT registration in Italy gives rise to a
permanent establishment and therefore a corporation tax liability. This has
been confirmed to us by representatives of the Italian government. Should we
comply with EC law and pay higher corporate taxes in Italy or take account
of Italian law and avoid VAT registration there altogether? Is it fair that
on top of their other VAT obligations, European businesses should also be
forced to restructure themselves in order to avoid conflicts between EC and
local legislation?

Sir, The British economy lies in ruins. Successive governments have served
The Market, now revealed as the siren that has lured us on to the rocks. The
logic of economics has manifestly failed to meet the needs of British
people.
Markets destroy what is not immediately profitable and hence offer us no
future. An alternative vision would seek to maintain our industrial base
irrespective of short-term profit and would serve the people instead of
sacrificing them to obsessions.
Exploiting our common wealth requires a common purpose. Understanding how
society works is outside the province of economics, subservient to market
rationality. For this reason economics is unable to offer remedies for the
problems we now face. Britain PLC needs a social vision.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Banking settlement proposal reduces risk but creates
illiquidity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SUBIR LALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Regarding your editorial on the clearing and settlement procedure in
operation in Chaps ('Well done, Chaps', October 7), your comment stresses
only the dimension of risk in the payment mechanism and the gains from
reducing risk.
The present system of end-of-day net settlement is risky from the point of
view of the central bank but has the property of providing a high degree of
liquidity to the financial system. The proposed reform is one of continuous
gross settlement with collateralised overdraft facility.
While there is no denying that risk is virtually eliminated, the proposed
solution goes to the other extreme in that it may make the system highly
illiquid. The basic role of the banking system is to provide liquidity by
making the market in liquid funds, ie bank reserves. This will reduce the
competitiveness of British banks in the global market. The US domestic
payment system (Fedwire) has recently instituted a pricing scheme for
overdrafts, but overdrafts do not have to be collateralised (unlike the
cross-border Chips system which has partial collateralisation). Full
collateralisation will impose an immense burden on banks and their customers
and this will impose an unduly 'excessive' tax on the banking system.
While it is certainly important to reduce risk, it should not be done in a
way so as to paralyse the basic banking functions. It would be more
appropriate to have a system of net end-of-day settlement with explicit caps
on the extent of intra-day overdrafts, combined with a pricing scheme for
overdrafts. Collateralisation, if any, should be a very small proportion of
the overdrafts so as not to tax the system. Indeed, as you point out, these
issues are significant from the point of view of an integrated European
payments system which is all the more reason to have a balanced view of the
trade-off between risk and liquidity.

FT  19 OCT 92 / A face-lift passing for emergency first aid: The Birmingham
summit did little to resolve the mounting pile of problems facing the
Maastricht treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Birmingham summit was supposed to give a shot in the arm to Mr John
Major, but it may go down as the day the British government shot itself in
the foot.
The government's panicky handling of the coal industry crisis has unsettled
Britain's European Community partners as much as Tory backbenchers. Last
Friday's surprise 1 percentage point cut in UK interest rates was a damaging
blow to the prime minister, renewing doubts about his judgment and political
strength at home.
As one senior member of an EC delegation remarked of Britain's apparent solo
dash for growth. 'Your government has learnt nothing. It is repeating the
same mistakes of the past 20 years.'
In the past four weeks, Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary,
have laboured mightily to rebuild Britain's standing in Europe after the
withdrawal of sterling from the exchange rate mechanism and the ensuing row
with the German government and the Bundesbank.
The efforts to banish the mistrust surrounding the British presidency of the
EC have met with some success, mainly because Mr Major managed to unite his
cabinet behind the one goal which matters most to his European partners -
early ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European Union, without
renegotiation.
In this sense, the coal industry crisis could not have come at a worse time.
Having placed their faith in Mr Major to deliver ratification of the treaty,
EC leaders now see the risk this week of a parliamentary defeat for Mr Major
on the pit closure programme - a defeat which could leave him gravely
weakened in the forthcoming battle with Tory Euro-sceptics to push
Maastricht through the House of Commons.
Before the coal crisis, British diplomats were arguing that Mr Major had
exploited his domestic problems to his own advantage. Thus, the Tory party
conference in Brighton, highlighted by a minor revolt of Euro-sceptics led
by Lord Tebbit, had underlined the difficulties in securing Maastricht
ratification. The question which EC leaders now want to know is whether Mr
Major will be weakened to the point where he dare not submit the treaty to
the Commons before Christmas.
European leaders headed by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany and President
Francois Mitterrand of France are adamant that there is no alternative to
the ratification of Maastricht by all 12 member states. In their view,
treaty ratification is vital to end the crisis of confidence in the
Community, its leaders and its institutions which erupted last June when
Danish voters narrowly rejected the treaty.
What was striking about the one-day Birmingham summit was how little time it
devoted to the issues which many believe lie at the root of the current
problems facing Europe - the accelerating economic downturn which in turn is
raising questions about the common drive for economic convergence and future
European monetary union laid out in the Maastricht treaty.
Nor was there are any attempt to put pressure on France, the lone hold-out
on a Gatt world trade agreement, which now appears within reach and which
many leaders present in Birmingham believe offers the best prospect for
world economic recovery.
Instead, leaders focused on the need to give the EC what amounts to a
face-lift. In contrite mood, they acknowledged that the Community had failed
to explain in simple language what it was doing and why; and they drew up a
list of ideas aimed at selling the Maastricht treaty to the sceptical
citizens of Europe.
In future, the heads of government pledged that the Community will be more
open and more democratic. Among the ideas put forward by the British
presidency and the European Commission are: British-style green papers
inviting public comment on proposed EC legislation; the dispatch of
individual commissioners to liaise with national parliaments to explain the
Commission's annual work plans; and the partial opening-up of EC foreign
ministers' sessions to the public.
The more important tinkering involves the application of 'subsidiarity', the
concept of maximum devolution of power to national, regional and local
government. But here again, there may be less to the ideas currently under
discussion than meets the public eye.
Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has staged an
effective counter-attack against British and German efforts to rein back the
power of Brussels.
In Birmingham, he argued that the Commission would become less active now
that the big burst of legislation tied to the creation of a single European
market was virtually complete. He also secured British agreement that the
introduction of subsidiarity would not change the balance of institutional
power in Brussels, adroitly playing on the fears of smaller EC states which
view the Commission as their traditional protector against the bigger
members.
Even more striking, Mr Delors noted that subsidiarity could only be truly
applied in a federal system. As the Commission's latest working paper on the
subject suggests, the obvious model is the 10th amendment to the US
constitution, which enumerates the balance of powers between the Federal
government and the states.
Yet federalism is anathema to the UK government, which views subsidiarity as
a means of increasing the purview of national parliaments at the expense of
the Community-wide approach, under the wider goal of enhancing co-operation
between EC governments.
'What we have are two completely different schools of thought,' says a
senior EC official, 'and the British need to make up their mind on what they
want to do.'
In the six weeks leading up to the next EC summit in Edinburgh, the British
presidency must attempt to bridge these gaps on subsidiarity. For it is at
Edinburgh that decisions must be taken which ought to produce the form of
words which the governments of the UK and Denmark will use to win support
for the treaty, first in the House of Commons and then in a second Danish
referendum late next spring.
What Birmingham showed was that leaders found it far easier to agree on
declarations of intent than to support concrete action. Yet at the same time
the problems continue to pile up. Negotiations on the Delors II budget
package to increase 'cohesion funds' for the poorer member states have
barely begun, though the respective bargaining positions are clearly
identified; and talks between Denmark and its partners on modifications to
Maastricht are only due to start early next month.
Delay in agreement on any of these issues could be fatal, because it would
foster the impression of drift currently afflicting the Community. It could
even encourage others states, notably France and Germany, to press ahead
with their own plans for political and monetary union based on an 'inner
core' of federally minded, stronger economies. At present, neither country
wishes to create a mini-Europe; but neither intends to leave the EC in

FT  19 OCT 92 / Letter: Fraud made easier by avarice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr OLADELE OLAGBAJU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article 'Companies face new fraud threat from Nigeria'
(September 14), the impression given is that any business inquiry made by
any Nigerian company is to be avoided at all costs.
What your correspondents forgot to mention is the fact that any company
which willingly answers to the demands of tricksters is in fact looking for
a quick buck and will find trouble aplenty. It is a pity such companies have
to lose their money before they realise their folly.
What you should be asking is how many companies had answered such demands,
hoped for a wind-fall, lost some money, and are now licking their wounds.
Simply, avarice at its best.

Ever wondered why some London cabbies seem to drive around without their
'for hire' signs illuminated even when they are looking for fares?
A colleague who successfully hailed one such cab, got in, gave his
destination, and asked the driver why he hadn't bothered to switch his sign
on.
'It is on,' the cabbie replied. 'Trouble is, I spend so much time driving
around empty these days that the bleedin' bulb's gone.'

Greg Dyke, the irrepressible group chief executive of London Weekend
Television, is a master of the cheap shot.
At a recent conference in London on the prospects for advertising revenues
in 1993, Dyke hoisted high a black bag containing, he said, the tools by
which to determine precisely the immediate future of advertising revenues.
It contained a roulette wheel, a pack of playing cards and a dice.
After taking a side-swipe at economists and their predictive powers - 'an
economist is someone good with figures but lacking the personality to be an
accountant' - Dyke proceeded to take take out a Bible and summoned the
assembled to prayer.
'Will someone somewhere please end the recession before all the advertising
agency owners are forced to sell their Porsches,' he pleaded.

Michael Heseltine is not the first president of Britain's Board of Trade to
find that the resources to hand will not stretch to sustain an
insufficiently economic coal industry. His predecessor, the Earl of
Dalhousie, was in a comparable pickle soon after leaving the presidency in
1847 to become governor general of India.
Aiming to improve transportation there, he set about developing the East
Indian Railway. But he was saddled by the London-based Indian Board of
Control with a specification and budget to lay down 92 miles of double
track, which would have been 30 miles too short to reach the Raneegunge
coalfield.
'I regard the proposal as totally useless,' Dalhousie wrote. 'The government
might as well construct a railway from the jail to the general hospital.'
Whereupon he ignored the official policy, built a single-track line that
served the coalfield, and both worked prosperously for a good while
thereafter.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Among the wise old owls of business, Lord Kadoorie of Kowloon now retiring
from the chairmanship of Hong Kong's China Light &amp; Power, is on a perch of
his own. Compared with him at 93, there's a callow look about other family
patriarchs such as Gianni Agnelli and Lord Forte, who have likewise
scheduled themselves for retirement.
The Kadoories have always been different from the other members of Hong
Kong's ruling elite. For a start, the 93-year-old's father, Elly, was a
Jewish merchant from Baghdad instead of a clansman from a Scottish lowlands.
Moreover, unlike many of the other local Taipans, the Kadoorie family has
long preferred to live in the colony than London, and concentrate its
philanthropy on the Near and Far East. It has helped them adapt better than
most to the changes in China.
Whereas Jardine, Matheson opened in Canton in 1832 and the Swires set up in
Shanghai in 1867 and started the China Navigation Company in 1872, the
Kadoories did not really get going in China until the early part of this
century.
True, like the others, they have had to rebuild their fortunes on several
occasions and to repel hungry predators from their quoted businesses, which
include a controlling stake in the famous Peninsula Hotel. But despite
criticism that they were not moving with the times, their conservative
approach has paid dividends.
If Forbes magazine is to be believed, the Kadoorie family has a net worth of
Dollars 3bn, or Dollars 1bn more than the Swire brothers and roughly 10
times the estimated worth of the Keswicks, who run Jardine, Matheson.
So it would seem that the battered humpty-dumpty doll - which the retiring
Lord keeps in his office to remind him of the consequences of losing your
balance - has served him well.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY from gas-fired power stations is probably 50 per cent more
expensive than that generated by coal, an energy expert said last night.
Mr Nigel Lucas, professor of Energy Policy at Imperial College in London,
said on BBC Television: 'By buying gas-fired electricity from the
independent power producers, the regional electricity companies are probably
paying up to 50 per cent more than the price of electricity which might be
available to them from existing coal-fired stations.'
Mr Malcolm Faulkner, North West Electricity Board's marketing director, also
speaking on BBC Television, accepted that coal was cheaper in the short
term, but said: 'We are in fact not comparing like with like. We get
economic or cheaper electricity from old coal stations, but we cannot
guarantee that cheaper (coal-powered) electricity will continue into the
future.'

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN parliament is expected to apply for up to Dollars 500m (Pounds
290m) in foreign aid to help train millions of accountants over the next few
years, Andrew Jack writes.
Mr Anatoly Sheremet, head of accounting at Moscow State University and an
influential figure in the emerging accountancy profession, said he met
officials from the World Bank last week to discuss loans for training
proposals.
He thought it likely that the Russian parliament would apply to the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund over the next few months. He
estimated that Dollars 500m would be required to cover the costs of training
teachers, translating and publishing textbooks and buying computers.
Mr Sheremet, who was visiting the US to attend the World Congress of
Accountants last week, said: 'I told the World Bank: Without accountants
there will be no market economy.'
The Association of Accountants of the Commonwealth of Independent States,
which he heads, has estimated a need for more than 2m new accountants in the
next three to four years, including 100,000 with skills equivalent to
chartered accountants.

<TEXT>
US banks may not be over their credit woes yet and could see current
profitability disappear when interest rates rise, according to the acting
head of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the federal bank
regulatory agency, Reuter reports from Boston.
'Given the problems in certain real estate markets, I don't think you are
out of the woods yet,' Mr Stephen Steinbrink told bankers at the American
Bankers' Association annual meeting at the weekend.
He also warned that when interest rates rose, some banks could find
themselves in trouble. 'We are all delighted to see increased bank earnings.
I'm concerned about the source,' Mr Steinbrink said. A substantial source of
earnings came from the decline in interest rates and widened spreads.
'If rates climb, you all may find it difficult to maintain current levels of
profitability. Even worse, if you don't take precautions now, you could find
yourself caught in an interest rate squeeze.'
He added it was too soon to see how the banking reform bill passed in 1991
would affect banks, as many of the bill's provisions had not yet become
effective. On December 19 the bill's rule to close banks whose capital falls
below 2 per cent will become law.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (8): Why
there may be a game plan after all - Profile of Lazard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE DOES not appear to be anything as portentous as a Grand Strategy at
Lazard. Other investment banks talk of building global networks and
extending into new businesses which offer 'synergies' with what they already
do. These banks are driven by the same remorseless logic with which they try
to infect their clients: that a small handful of global firms will come to
dominate all international industries, leaving smaller or domestic rivals
out in the cold.
By comparison, the Lazard grouping (Lazard Freres in Paris and New York and
Lazard Brothers in London) appears at times not be following a powerful game
plan. It was criticised in the mid-1980s for not participating in the orgy
of mergers in London designed to create full-service investment banks - only
to emerge as one of the success stories of that super-heated decade in the
mergers and acquisitions business.
Now, with conventional wisdom preaching concentration on core businesses,
Lazard has been busy spinning into new areas. It was one of the first London
banks to begin trading the debt of lesser developed countries, for instance
 -now one of the biggest profit-earners for the investment banking world.
Mr Michel David-Weill, the French chairman of Lazard Freres and, until a
year ago, of Lazard Brothers, says the Lazard houses are constantly on the
look out for new businesses. 'During the high days of junk bonds, we weren't
in them. Now we are in them, as an issuer in the US. Counter-cyclically,
there are types of financing we can do.'
There seem to be three principles controlling the expansion of Lazard.
First, new businesses have to offer a good profit margin (or, as the smooth
Mr David-Weill prefers to put it, it has to be something where Lazard can
'add something' rather than just be one of the crowd).
Second, they must be low users of capital. Committing large amounts of
capital to a business could result in loss of independence, 'since you need
to change to institutional owners,' says Mr David-Weill. The private Lazard
partnership structure - with a 50 per cent holding by Pearson, which also
owns the Financial Times - has been developed to prevent any such loss
occurring.
Third, they should not use many people. Large teams of staff create an
overhead which becomes a burden if particular business lines turn down. As
it is, Lazard has not had to reduce staff numbers in the current downturn,
says Mr David-Weill. 'Nobody in the world is without cost pressures,' he
says. 'We try very hard to moderate the trend upwards. Can we cut
drastically? At this time in view of our work we can cope.'
In spite of this broadly pragmatic approach, however, there is still more
than a hint of a global game plan at work in the brain of the 59-year-old Mr
David-Weill. That became clear at the end of the 1980s, as he moved to bring
the three Lazard houses closer together to take advantage of the increasing
volume of cross-border merger and acquisition business. Until then, all
three had remained powerful domestic advisory firms, with little
co-operation between them. Yet potentially, with its strong US base, Lazard
was in a position to do what no European corporate finance had managed
before - break into the transatlantic corporate M&amp;A as an adviser in both
continents.
'I'm one who believes that nothing is vital,' says Mr David-Weill. 'You can
do well in just one market. That being said, it is a clear advantage to have
a position in the US.'
With particular partners from each of the houses either permanently
stationed in - or frequent visitors to - each of the others, cross-border
deals handled by the firm have picked up. Rivals in the UK now frequently
talk of Lazard as a model when talking about their own ambitions to develop
internationally.
Sharing profits between the different parts of the group has not proved a
problem, says Mr David-Weill. 'It's fairly simple. It's not even a matter of
great discussion. The place where the deal is done gets two-thirds, the
other house gets one third.' Where all three houses are involved, the
leading house will get about half the fee, with the others a quarter each,
he adds.
The question overhanging Lazard now is whether it has developed fast enough
from its domestic bases to meet the challenge of the internationally minded
(mainly US) investment banks that have invaded the European M&amp;A market in
recent years. Its recent expansion into Germany and Italy has been slow and
cautious.
This year's tussle for control of Perrier, the French mineral water group,
between the Agnelli family and BSN, the French food group, displayed both
the strengths and the weaknesses of the bank's position as a close adviser
to some of the continent's biggest business groupings. Mr David-Weill is
himself close to both Mr Gianni Agnelli and to Mr Antoine Riboud, chief
executive of BSN, and sits on the boards of each group. Lazard also owns 2
per cent of Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank that advises the Agnellis.
Faced with this conflict, Lazard opted to advise BSN. It is the sort of
uncomfortable position which merchant bankers dread, though Mr David-Weill
now tries to smooth over the tensions. 'There was a view that we were on
very bad terms with our friends,' he says. It really shows exactly the
opposite. We can be very useful in very many ways.'
Such conflicts, though, create opportunities for competitors. The challenge
for Lazard will to grow into enough markets for such spats to become less
significant for its business as a whole.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (6):
Euro-scepticism slows an inevitable process - While Europe has seen fewer
cross-border mergers recently, more may be on the way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACE of cross-border European mergers and acquisitions has slowed
markedly over the last three months. This lull in activity - attributed by
experts to currency uncertainty and the growing strain of high real interest
rates - is all the more disappointing after a pronounced recovery in the
volume and value of deals in the first half of 1992.
Figures from KPMG show that the number of deals last year averaged just 250
a quarter (around Dollars 6bn every three months) - significantly less than
in the go-go days of 1988-90.
The first and second quarters of 1992, by contrast, saw cross-border
transactions to the value of Dollars 11.8bn and Dollars 15.7bn respectively,
encouraging hopes of a sustained pick-up throughout the rest of the year. It
is in this context that the 160 deals recorded between July and September -
worth Dollars 7.7bn - will be seen as something of a setback.
One obvious question is whether Euro-scepticism - as manifested in the
French and Danish referendums and opposition to the Maastricht treaty - may
have dealt a mortal blow to European corporate activity. The answer is
almost certainly not.
Taking the long view, the current process of European integration can be
seen to date back to the postwar years. Initially, it developed in a largely
political framework, industrial consolidation starting in earnest only in
the early 1980s.
The momentum gathered pace in the middle of the decade with the adoption of
the single market programme and all the attendant hype. But just as all
trade barriers will not be lifted by December 31 1992, so the restructuring
spurred on by this deadline will continue, probably well into the 21st
century.
'The present uncertainty is not going to stop deals,' notes Mr Vincent
Thompson of Hambros Bank. 'Companies still view the European market as of
fundamental importance, regardless of doubts over Maastricht.'
Mr Thompson acknowledges, though, that events of recent weeks have done
nothing to whet the appetite of foreign predators eyeing up UK targets,
while erratic stock markets tend to discourage the flow of deals.
According to Mr Nick Cowley at KPMG's international headquarters in
Amsterdam, booming economies in the late 1980s often masked the cost of
strategic errors. 'In current economic conditions buyers will have to be
more selective, and in some countries of course the currency risk has now
returned. The ERM undoubtedly encouraged deals because the risks had in
effect been reduced to the width of the relevant currency bands.'
Mr Cowley emphasises, though, that the single European market is already a
reality. 'Companies will increasingly be up against pan-European
competitors, which means there is bound to be more consolidation.'
French companies, so far at any rate, have proved to be the most active
cross-border raiders. Between January 1 1988 and June 30 this year they
splashed out Dollars 37.5bn on 775 foreign acquisitions, against Dollars
20bn and Dollars 10.7bn by their British and German counterparts
(representing 982 and 335 deals respectively). Americans and Australians
have been the most persistent predators from outside the EC, though the
value of HSBC's bid for Midland Bank on its own was roughly 150 per cent
that of all the Australian deals over the period from 1988 to mid-1992.
Countries which have attracted most cross-border interest in these four and
a half years are the UK (where companies worth more than Dollars 85bn have
been sold to foreigners), France (Dollars 23.3bn) and Germany (Dollars
22bn).
The game from now on will be to spot which sectors are ripe for further M&amp;A
activity. Those which have consistently featured in the last few years
include oil and gas, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, electricals and
electronics, food, drink and tobacco, financial services, transportation,
and paper and board products.
Many experts believe that the process of consolidation in the food industry
still has further to go. Certain subsectors such as chocolate - where
two-thirds of the European market is controlled by five companies - are
admittedly highly concentrated. Hence the fierce battle between the leading
US food companies Kraft General Foods and Hershey to take over Freia Marabou
of Norway, a company with proven brands and a strong market position.
That said, the structure of the industry in, say, Italy - where there are
some 10 times as many food companies as there are in France - points to
continued activity in some parts of the European Community. Changing
consumer tastes are likely to ensure that, though whether it will extend to
cross-border venturing in food retailing, as some observers suppose, is
another matter.
Corporate strategists in the financial services sector have also been busy,
though much of the concentration has taken place within national borders.
Countries like Italy, Spain and Portugal have specifically encouraged
mergers as a means of bolstering their banking systems ahead of the expected
foreign onslaught which 1993 promises to bring.
Full-blown insurance mergers have been few and far between. This year's
ill-fated effort by Denmark's Hafnia and Norway's Uni Storebrand to forge a
major Scandinavian grouping is likely to serve as a discouragement for some
time to come.
However, big French companies such as UAP and Assurances Generales de France
have discreetly been building up European networks; while they and other
continental giants have their hands full at the moment, Brussels' efforts to
prise open the notoriously restrictive European insurance market may well
lead to a new wave of takeovers.
Similarly, the EC's liberalising moves in air transport may act as a spur to
consolidation. That said, although Air France has finally joined forces with
Belgium's Sabena, the highly nationalistic airline business will not easily
conform to sensible economies of scale. Equally, it may be wishful thinking
to assume that there will be rationalisation in the motor industry simply
because the US market can survive with just three major manufacturers.
Perhaps the next M&amp;A wave will be characterised by more joint ventures, as
architects of deals seek to overcome these sensitivities. Transactions may
also be structured more along the lines of the recent Reed-Elsevier merger,
with the burden of financing reduced.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (7): Purse
strings become tighter - The financing of deals is now more risk-sensitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCING of mergers and acquisitions has become more risk-sensitive in
the course of the past year. At the same time as the pace of mergers and
acquisitions has slowed, the financing of M&amp;A business has become
increasingly selective.
'Financing has become much more difficult for entrepreneurial companies,'
says one banker. 'High-risk financing is just not happening.'
Capital constraints and a bad record on loans to highly leveraged companies
have tightened the purse strings of banks that are considering
acquisition-related lending.
The highly leveraged transactions (HLTs) which fuelled management buyouts
and leveraged buyouts in the 1980s, mainly in the US, are no longer
available. On the other hand, there is a continuing trend for the
deleveraging of companies which became heavily indebted through MBOs and
LBOs in the 1980s.
Strong equity markets for much of the past two years have enabled companies,
particularly in the US, which had borrowed in order to acquire during the
1980s takeover boom, to refinance their debts and rebuild their balance
sheets. The US junk or high yield bond market, after several years of
inactivity, has been showing signs of life, but companies have been
returning to that market mainly to refinance outstanding bonds.
Some companies have been able to achieve considerable cost savings, where
improving credit ratings have been coincided with a low point in the US
interest rate cycle.
But after a strong start to the year, equity markets have become more
difficult, and sources of funding have dried up again.
As a result, the limited activity in the M&amp;A market has been orchestrated
largely by big, cash-rich companies, such as Nestle, the Swiss food group
which recently won its fiercely contested FFr13.42bn bid for Perrier, the
French mineral water company. Another example is Kraft General Foods
International, part of the Philip Morris group of the US, which made an
agreed Dollars 1.5bn bid for Freia Marabou, the leading chocolate,
confectionery and snacks producer in Scandinavia.
Recently, Hanson, the Anglo-American conglomerate, launched a Pounds 780m
cash bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery products
group, the first sizeable hostile takeover in the UK for some months.
'Some companies can use cash, or take up bank credit lines, to buy first and
worry about refinancing later, because they have the capital strength to
separate those two decisions,' says one banker. 'Smaller companies do not
have that luxury.'
The difficulties experienced by less cash-rich companies in securing funding
for takeovers may help spawn fresh approaches to acquisition financing. The
most innovative financing so far this year was Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's
funding of its Pounds 3.6bn takeover of Midland Bank, which involved a rare
use of the bond market for the initial financing of a takeover.
HSBC Holdings' Pounds 448m 10-year subordinated Eurobond provided a number
of subsidiary benefits, including boosting capital and avoiding excessive
dilution of shareholders' funds.
It is widely thought that the offer of more generous terms on the bonds  -
and a cash alternative - when Hongkong Bank increased its bid on June 2
helped secure the deal by edging out Lloyds Bank, its rival.
Initially, the bonds were to be priced to yield 160 basis points above the
10-year gilt yield, a spread which was generally considered inadequate given
the credit quality of the offering: deeply subordinated debt issued by a
bank holding company. Under the increased bid, Hongkong Bank offered par
bonds at a spread of 240 basis points above the comparable gilt yield, and a
cash alternative for investors who did not want to take the bonds. Since
then, the spread has tightened to around 160 basis points, creating profits
for shareholders who took the bonds rather than the cash.
The offering is the first of its kind in the Eurobond market. Because
Eurobonds are internationally-traded bearer instruments, the structure
facilitated distribution to a much wider range of investors than would have
been possible with a domestic sterling bond issue.
The existence of broad overseas demand helped buoy confidence in the UK,
where the structure of the deal could have severely limited distribution.
Although HSBC's approach may be imitated by other banks, corporates are
unlikely to follow the same path.
'Accounting for banks recognises that subordinated debt is close to equity;
corporate accounting does not accept that,' says one corporate financier.
There are still examples, if rare ones, of companies taking on large amounts
of debt to fund ambitious acquisitions. The Dollars 1.85bn bid for Spain's
two largest cement companies, Valenciana and Sanson, by Cementos Mexicanos
(Cemex) will increase its long-term debt by Dollars 760m - assuming
refinancing and asset sales go according to plan.
But for the moment, most companies are not keen to take on substantial
amounts of new debt, and the demand for acquisition-related financing
appears likely to remain at a low ebb, with little sign of a major pick-up
in M&amp;A activity in sight.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (5): OK to
sell the silver - Changing attitudes in Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS a time when selling a business in Germany was not merely socially
unacceptable - it was a mark of downright social failure.
But, says Mr Paul Achleitner, head of mergers and acquisitions for
German-speaking countries at Goldman Sachs, this has changed in the two
years since German reunification.
'You have the whole economy up for sale,' he observes, referring to the
Treuhand's campaign to sell eastern German enterprises to the private
sector. So far the Treuhand - the government's privatisation agency - has
managed to offload more than 9,000 former eastern German companies, and
there are still nearly 4,000 enterprises left to be privatised.
As a result of this unprecedented sell-off, Germans have altered their
preconceptions about the buying and selling of companies, Mr Achleitner
argues. It has become not just socially acceptable, but essential for this
M&amp;A activity to take place, for the good of the German economy as a whole.
Moreover, the Treuhand has overcome its initial reluctance to use outside
advisers and has become a major source of business for large numbers of
investment banks and consultants which otherwise would have found it
difficult to find a foothold in Germany.
In general, German companies employ external financial advisers in some 20
per cent of all transactions, preferring to rely on either in-house
expertise or on their commercial banking contacts. Investment bankers
believe that the more familiar their services become in Germany, the more
business they will be able to do.
They are confident despite a perceptible slowing down in the number and size
of transactions done by German companies during the past year. Figures from
M&amp;A International, a consulting firm near Frankfurt, show that the number of
deals involving German companies fell by 9 per cent from 953 in the first
half of 1991 to 843 in the first six months of the current year.
Without the impetus of privatisation in the east, it is likely that the
number of deals would have been down to the 700 or so recorded in the first
six months of 1989 and 1990.
Large, spectacular transactions have been thin on the ground this year. The
Hoesch/Krupp merger is still to be completed, blocked by a technicality, and
Pirelli continues to wrangle with the Continental tyre company in which it
holds a 39 per cent stake.
Aachener &amp; Munchener Beteiligungs, Germany's second largest insurance
company after Allianz, came to an agreement with Assurances Generales de
Paris, the large French insurance company which holds a 25 per cent-plus in
the German company, but up until recently was not allowed to exercise the
votes on its full stake.
The role played by advisers in these 'situations' was limited. Krupp devised
its highly effective strategy to gain control of Hoesch without the help of
an Anglo-American investment bank; Hoesch employed S G Warburg after its
days as an independent company were already numbered. Morgan Grenfell - the
Deutsche Bank M&amp;A subsidiary - continued to advise Continental.
Warburg was advising AMB's management on its defence against AGF, but its
strategy was undermined after the insurance company's supervisory board cut
a deal with the French, over the heads of the management board. One
condition of the agreement was that AGF would help AMB find a buyer for its
majority-owned BfG Bank subsidiary, and Morgan Grenfell has landed the role
as adviser to shareholders in BfG in current sale negotiations.
Many transactions receive little or no publicity, and it is these, less
sensational deals which keep investment bankers busy in Germany - and give
them hope for the future despite the current slowdown in the economy.
There are two distinct target markets: the medium-sized companies which
constitute the Mittelstand, and the very large conglomerates which may be
persuaded to divest a subsidiary or two in the name of greater efficiency.
Some 10,000 small to medium-sized companies account for half Germany's GNP.
Many of these companies, built up in the decades since the war, are in
difficulties because of the economy, others face the fabled 'succession'
problem as young inheritors feel no inclination to take over day-to-day
management responsibilities.
These pressures mean that an increasing number of Mittelstand companies will
come up for sale, providing an opportunity for investment banks,
particularly those able to scout abroad for potential buyers.
The structure of larger companies, meanwhile, often reflects historical
accident and the empire-building tendencies of earlier generations of
management - rather than hard thinking about strategic priorities. Nowadays,
as market conditions deteriorate and company managers begin to feel pressure
from institutional shareholders to perform, large companies have good reason
to contemplate spinning-off non-core businesses.
Goldman Sachs can point to four big transactions this year when it has
advised family shareholders on the sale of their businesses: the best-known
is that of Hugo Boss, the menswear group sold to the Italian Marzotto group.
Another is the Krantz plant construction company acquired by Deutsche
Babcock. It is now working on 24 M&amp;A projects in Germany, of which 20 are
sales mandates or divestitures.
The Krupp takeover of Hoesch has highlighted that hostile bids can be
successful in Germany, although no foreign investment bank has dared risk
its domestic contacts by bringing in a foreign and unfriendly bidder for a
big German company. Morgan Grenfell in Frankfurt is however advising two
large, but identified German companies on defence strategies.

Splashing out is a thing of the past - Activity in Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GONE ARE the days when Japanese corporations threw money into mergers and
acquisitions in the notion that they were an immediate and painless way to
expand market share or diversify into a promising new field.
In their place, a more temperate era has emerged in which funding is tight
and deals are more likely to involve relatively low-risk minority stakes and
strategic alliances than splashy multi-billion dollar buyouts.
The slowdown in activity is apparent in figures compiled by Yamaichi
Securities for the first half of 1992. They show the number of deals
involving Japanese firms - outbound, inbound and domestic transactions,
including majority and minority stakes - fell 25 per cent from the
year-earlier level to 245.
Of the total, values were disclosed for 117 deals and fell a more modest 8
per cent to Y358.3bn. That is still well behind last year's pace when Y985bn
in M&amp;A activity was made public and a mere fraction of 1989's record Y3.1
trillion. The average value of transactions likewise has tumbled from Y9.1bn
in 1989 to Y3.5bn last year and Y3.1bn in the first six months of 1992.
A fall in the number of outbound and domestic M&amp;A transactions accounted for
the overall declines, retreating 33 per cent and 24 per cent respectively.
However, this masks a near-doubling of the value of domestic transactions in
the first January-June period.
'Domestic transactions are now increasing more quickly than over the last
couple of years due to the financial situation and restructuring as
companies go back to their core businesses,' says Mr Masaharu Yonezawa,
senior adviser to Recof International, an M&amp;A boutique. 'In our
organisation, we're the busiest we've been in our five years of operation
because of domestic transactions.'
With the domestic market heating up, 18 inbound transactions were announced
in the half-year to June, already equalling the 1991 total. However, the
value of transactions has fallen off, indicating that it is relatively small
firms that are on the block.
The overseas M&amp;A market, where 105 deals were reported in the first half,
felt the effects of poor results among previous buyouts, financial and
economic troubles at home and a continued recession in the US, UK and
Europe.
The US nevertheless maintained its premier destination status, accounting
for over 40 per cent of Japanese outbound transactions, or 46 in total,
followed by the EC with 26, according to Yamaichi. The figures were down 29
per cent and 47 per cent respectively. In contrast, activity in neighbouring
Asian countries and other areas held steady, accounting for about 20 per
cent of the outbound deals.
It is not surprising that Japanese firms are showing an extra measure of
caution regarding overseas M&amp;A, given their late-1980s blunders and
excesses. No deal typifies this better than Bridgestone's takeover in the
spring of 1988 of Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber of the US for Dollars 2.6bn.
It was the largest Japanese manufacturing buyout to date. Mr Akira Yeiri,
president of Bridgestone, agreed to pay Dollars 80 a share for antiquated
Firestone without so much as an on-site inspection, just nine days after
Italy's Pirelli offered Dollars 58.
Since then, Bridgestone has pumped well over Dollars 1bn more into Firestone
and seen its own results suffer as a consequence.
Nor has Matsushita Electric Industrial's purchase of movie maker MCA for
Y780bn proved a smash hit. Sony has fared somewhat better in turning around
Sony Pictures Entertainment, formerly Columbia Pictures Entertainment. But
even there the synergies between entertainment hardware and software, cited
as a cause for the deal, remain elusive.
The bottom line is that Japan Inc.'s view of M&amp;A has changed dramatically
over the past few years, as has its position in the business world. While
strategic deals are continuing, too many acquisitions have gone sour,
yielded disappointing profits and involved unexpectedly severe headaches to
expect another repeat of the late-1980s anytime soon.
'Cross-border transactions will be revived in about two years, both inbound
and outbound,' predicts Recof's Mr Yonezawa. 'Japanese firms are getting
more clever and are very cautious. When faced with any opportunity, they
conduct due diligence and consider pricing carefully.
'The problem now is a credit squeeze and the fact that executives can't see
what's going on in the global economy. When they have a clearer idea in one
or two years, I think they will start to take up opportunities, whether they
involve closing factories, making greenfield investments or conducting M&amp;A'
Among the 122 domestic deals, Yamaichi noted a decline in activity in the
materials, processing, commerce and other sectors amid anaemic demand and a
general view among corporate strategists that the nation is bloated from
excessive capital spending over the past several years. However, the more
than doubling in the value of such deals in the first six months of 1992 may
reflect the distress of many mid-sized sellers.
It comes as no surprise that the number of inbound transactions is growing
at a time when many local companies are short of cash and more intent on
restructuring and slashing their own capital spending than in taking on
someone else's problems.
One leading buyout recently was the US firm S C Johnson's multi-billion yen
acquisition of 74.5 per cent of Lion Insecticide, formerly a subsidiary of
Lion Corp. General Motors' affiliate Electronic Data Services also purchased
19.9 per cent of troubled software developer Japan Systems Corp. for
Y3.75bn. In the pharmaceutical industry, Pfizer of the US took over Koshin
Medical for Y3bn.
One deal that typifies the incentives of many buyers and sellers is American
toy maker Hasbro's buyout of Nomura Toys from owner Koichi Nomura. Hasbro,
faced with steady inroads into its home market by Japanese competitors, is
seeking to gain a foothold and distribution in Japan. Meanwhile, Nomura
reportedly has had an increasingly hard time taking on giants like Nintendo
and Sega without a heavyweight partner.
Indeed, it is family owned businesses, especially those founded in the early
post-war years by owners now reaching retirement age, that offer the best
pickings for foreigners. In addition to succession problems, such firms
often lack necessary product development or marketing muscle to go it alone
in increasingly liberalised markets.
'Interest is rising in inward transactions, although the number of deals is
still small by international standards,' says Mr Yonezawa. 'The transactions
normally take time, so even though there have not been many announcements so
far, various negotiations are going on under water. I expect more
announcements this year and in 1993. The timing is very good with the
Japanese real estate and stock markets not as high as before.'
Other foreign firms, particularly in the drug and chemical industries, make
attractive suitors because of their worldwide distribution networks and
often superior technology.
All told, the number and value of inbound M&amp;A deals appear set to increase
further as Japanese firms increasingly find themselves facing the same sort
of competitive free-for-all at home that foreign rivals have grappled with
for years in other leading markets.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Kodak's divestment costs beat
forecast
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
EASTMAN Kodak, the world's biggest producer of photographic equipment, has
unveiled a third-quarter after-tax charge of about Dollars 140m, or 43 cents
a share, substantially higher than the Dollars 45m, or 14 cents, many
analysts had expected.
The impact on Kodak's full-year earnings will be more than offset by
benefits of about Dollars 150m, or 46 cents a share, from adopting a new
accounting standard for deferred tax. Kodak said the change would be
recognised from the beginning of 1992.
The Rochester, New York-based company said about half of the third-quarter
charges were linked to previously-announced plans to divest or otherwise
exit from several non-strategic businesses.
Another 25 per cent of the costs came from additional employees leaving
under Kodak's early retirement programme.
The remaining 25 per cent covered the costs of rationalising the group's
overseas operations - primarily the consolidation of its imaging business in
France, Japan and Brazil.
In 1991, Kodak took restructuring charges of Dollars 1.03bn partly to cover
early retirements this year. But workers responded more enthusiastically
than expected to the programme, which offers full retirement benefits and an
attractive health care package.
Excluding the charges, analysts expect Kodak to earn more than Dollars 1 a
share in the third quarter, against last year's third-quarter net loss of
Dollars 118m, or 37 cents, including restructuring charges of Dollars 435m.

LAIDLAW, the Ontario-based North American waste management and

helped by higher margins in some sectors, aggressive marketing and
cost-cutting.
Earnings for the three months ended August 31 were USDollars 24.9m, or 9
cents a share, against losses of USDollars 465.6m, or USDollars 1.84 a
share, a year earlier, including a special USDollars 469m charge covering a
writedown of Laidlaw's 28.4 per cent stake in ADT. Revenue was up 5 per cent
to USDollars 424m.
Profits for the full year were USDollars 132.4m, or 50 cents a share,
against losses of USDollars 344m, or USDollars 1.41 a share, after special
charges the year before. Revenues rose 2 per cent to USDollars 1.9bn. There
was an average 8 per cent more shares outstanding in fiscal 1992 compared
with 1991.
Laidlaw has restructured drastically in the past 18 months.

<TEXT>
ACCOR, the expansive French hotel and travel group which recently took over
its Belgian competitor, Wagons-Lits, in a controversial bid, suffered a
sharp fall in first-half net profits.
The group, which saw net profits plunge to FFr137.2m (Dollars 27.4m) for the
six months to June from FFr427.6m a year earlier, has been hit by the
slowdown of the European travel business and by the increase in its own net
debt due to the Wagons-Lits deal. The addition of Wagons-Lits brought about
an increase in turnover to FFr14.74bn from FFr7.28bn.
However, Accor says that without the Belgian acquisition, its interim sales
would have risen by 4.6 per cent, just ahead of France's annual inflation
rate, to FFr7.6bn.
Similarly, net operating profits, which slipped to FFr202m from FFr288.3m
because of Wagons-Lits' inclusion, would have been roughly static without
it.

STRONG progress in its core razors business helped Boston-based Gillette,
which is seeking to buy the UK's Parker Pen business, to report profits
after tax of Dollars 128.2m in the third quarter to end-September.
This compares with Dollars 104.1m in the same period a year earlier, with
sales rising from Dollars 1.14bn to Dollars 1.25bn. Earnings per share were
10 cents higher, year-on-year, at 58 cents.
The third-quarter figures bring Gillette's after-tax profits for the first
nine months of 1992 to Dollars 374.5m, compared with Dollars 296.3m in the
same period of 1991.
Gillette said that both sales and profits of its core blade and razors
business grew strongly during the quarter, with profits from Braun products
rising 'substantially'. Sales and profits in the Oral-B dental products
division also made significant advances.

restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAMALEA, one of two big property groups controlled by Toronto's Bronfman
family, is making a new effort to persuade holders of CDollars 525m senior
debentures to accept its five-year financial restructuring, writes Robert
Gibbens.
A committee representing the debenture-holders has blocked the company's
plan, saying it is unrealistic. The scheme hinges on selling half of
Bramalea's CDollars 6bn (USDollars 4.8bn) land and commercial property
portfolio. Secured creditors would get notes and common stock, effectively
giving them majority control.
Mr Marvin Marshall, president, has said that Bramalea has developed a
contingency plan to provide CDollars 65m extra cash-flow in 1993-1994. The
restructuring plan is viable, he insisted.
Bramalea is 'well advanced' in the sale of its 50 per cent interest in a big
Toronto stores mall. Industry sources say Trizec, 72 per cent owner of
Bramalea, will be the buyer.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Stanbic unveils rights issue to
raise R650m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Bank Investment Corporation (Stanbic), South Africa's largest
banking group by market capitalisation, is raising about R650m (Dollars
232m) through a rights issue which will enlarge the bank's capital base by
10 per cent.
Shareholders will be offered 10 new ordinary shares for every 100, at R60
each. The shares closed at R70.50 on Friday, R6.50 off their May peak.
Mr Eddie Theron, managing director, said that although the group was
adequately capitalised for existing regulations, it had always enjoyed
excess capital. This had recently dropped due to expenses incurred in
setting up a London office and paying Pounds 10m (Dollars 17m) in May for
British merchant bank Brown Shipley Holdings.
Mr Theron said it was better to go to the market now than be forced to go
when circumstances were less favourable. There were no immediate plans for
using the cash.
He said that in spite of recent turbulence on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange - down 22 per cent from its June peak - there was still
investor-appetite for quality equity paper.
Stanbic is the most highly-rated of South Africa's main banking groups. It
is trading on a price/earnings ratio of 13.7, and with a market
capitalisation of R7.5bn is the country's largest bank on this measure.
Shareholders holding more than 70 per cent of the issued share capital have
said they would follow their rights. Liberty Life will underwrite the
balance of the offer.
The group is also negotiating to buy the African interests of ANZ Grindlays.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: S Africa rescues gold mine with
R30m loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African govern- ment is to assist the troubled Harmony gold mine,
with a commercial loan up to a maximum of R30m (Dollars 10.7m).
In recent years the government has followed a strict policy of not offering
state aid to marginal mines unless they have potential to become viable.
Harmony is by far the largest of South Africa's marginal gold producers
threatened with closure because of the weak gold price.
Harmony did not return to profit during the September quarter as predicted
three months ago. Mr John Turner, chairman of Rand Mines gold division, said
this was because the grade of ore predicted in the rationalisation programme
had not been achieved.
He said, however, that recent productivity measures and the state aid should
ensure the mine's survival.
The mine incurred operating losses of R7.9m in the quarter compared with
R47m in the June quarter, which included extraordinary retrenchment costs.
The other three mines in the group reported improved results for the
September quarter compared with preceding three months. ERPM reduced its net
losses to R3.4m from R6.07m, Durban Deep lifted net profits marginally to
R1.06m from R1m and Blyvooruitzicht earned net profits of R1.5m compared
with losses of R274,000,
The state appears to have been persuaded to assist Harmony by the great
lengths the mine is going to ensure its own survival.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Pre-tax loss at Nokia deepens to
FM277m

<TEXT>
NOKIA, the Finnish telecommunications and electronics group, has reported
deeper pre-tax losses to FM277m (Dollars 59m) for the first eight months,
compared with FM205m a year earlier.
However, the figures disguise a strong improvement in the group's
performance in the second four months of the year, when it achieved taxable
profits of FM3m, compared with losses of FM229m for the same period a year
before.
Sales for the first eight months rose to FM9.96bn from FM9.55bn, underpinned
by an 8 per cent rise in sales from May to August.
Mr Jorma Ollila, Nokia president, said the turnround in the company's
performance got under way in May. He attributed it to strong growth in sales
and profits in both the mobile phones and telecommunications divisions, and
to last November's 12 per cent devaluation of the markka.
The problem area remains the group's consumer electronics division, which
made a 'substantial' loss due to the recession and price competition.
Mr Ollila said Nokia would earn an operating profit for the whole year,
wiping out in the final four months the FM152m operating loss incurred in
the first eight months.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Finnish guarantee fund prepares
banking merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND'S government guarantee fund is preparing to merge Skopbank and the
Savings Bank of Finland.
The move is seen as a preliminary step towards a wider restructuring of
Finnish banking and follows the failure of merger talks last week between
Unitas and Skopbank.
Mr Jorma Aranko, director-general of banking supervision, said the merger
was a streamlining operation designed to produce greater efficiency in the
troubled banking sector.
Skopbank, which on Thursday announced a FM2.2bn (Dollars 472m) loss for the
first eight months, was rescued by the Bank of Finland in September 1991 and
transferred to the state's guarantee fund in June.
Savings Bank of Finland will be converted into a limited liability company
prior to the merger. Savings Bank of Finland was formed last month following
the merger of 41 savings banks accounting for 80 per cent of the balance
sheet total of all the savings banks. Skopbank is the savings banks' central
bank.

bankruptcy

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese downturn has claimed its second bankruptcy victim among listed
companies this year, after Daiichi Spinning, the textile group filed for
court protection with liabilities of about Y100bn (Dollars 834m).
The Daiichi bankruptcy follows that of Lec, a Tokyo-based manufacturer of
household sundries.
Meanwhile, the Osaka Stock Exchange, where Daiichi is listed on the second
section, has launched an investigation into insider trading in its shares
last week after an unusual surge in trading.
The bankruptcy of even a medium-sized listed company in Japan suggests the
downturn is creating growing strains in relations between banks and
industrial clients. Traditionally, banks have helped industrial customers
through downturns in demand by providing renewed credit.
However, many banks have been hit themselves by a rapid growth in
non-performing loans on property lending. Some may now be taking a tougher
approach to troubled industrial clients. Daiichi's main bank is Sakura Bank.
Daiichi's filing for court protection under corporate rehabilitation law,
the Japanese equivalent of the US Chapter 11 procedures, marks the end to a
desperate financial struggle to stave off bankruptcy.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Del Monte to be sold for Pounds
360m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, JOHANNESBURG.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEL MONTE Foods International, the canned fruit and juices company, is being
sold to a joint venture between Royal Foods and Anglo American Corporation,
both of South Africa, for Pounds 360m - roughly 14.5 times historical
earnings.
DMFI, which is owned by institutions and management following a Pounds 229m
buy-out in 1990 in the wake of the break up of RJR Nabisco, announced plans
in February for a stock market listing.
Shareholders, however, led by Charterhouse Bank with just over 50 per cent,
have decided on a speedy sale at a guaranteed, if slightly lower, price
because of uncertainty in the stock market, according to Charterhouse.
DMFI is unrelated to the Del Monte fresh fruit business, which was bought by
Polly Peck, the fruit and electronics company which collapsed in 1990.
The Royal group, which is led by Mr Vivian Imerman and is involved in foods
and chemicals, has a market capitalisation about half the size of the DMFI
purchase price. Royal is eventually expected to seek a listing for part of
the group in London.
Royal Foods last year bought DMFI's South African fruit canning subsidiary,
which still supplies about half DMFI's deciduous fruits such as peaches and
apricots under a long term supply contract.
Anglo's involvement is in line with its aim to get into higher value added
areas of business, and breaks new ground by moving away from cyclical
commodities towards consumers.
However, Mr Graham Boustred, deputy chairman of Anglo, yesterday played down
talk of an important strategic shift saying: 'It's quite difficult to shift
a group of Anglo's size.'
Anglo and its associate, De Beers, currently have a joint market
capitalisation of about R36bn (Pounds 7.2bn).
The deal is also an interesting collaboration between Anglo, the pinnacle of
South Africa's Anglo-Saxon business establishment, and the youthful,
entrepreneurial and distinctly Jewish Royal group.
The acquisition is conditional on regulatory clearance in South Africa,
especially from the Reserve Bank, and successful completion of fund raising
by Royal, which met with banks over the weekend.
Anglo has committed to invest R400m directly.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Costain to dispose of Australian
coal offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COSTAIN, the troubled UK construction group, is expected to announce details
in the next few days of the sale of its profitable Australian coalmining
subsidiary.
Favourite to acquire the business is Peabody Coal, a subsidiary of Hanson
Group.
Costain is expected to raise Pounds 120m-Pounds 130m from the sale, after
taking into account the transfer of some Pounds 40m worth of local debt
owned by the Australian subsidiary.
Costain needs the cash to reduce net debt of Pounds 292m, including Pounds
52m of off-balance sheet loans due on the Spitalfields commercial property
joint venture in central London.
Total debt represents gearing of more than 100 per cent based on
shareholders' funds of Pounds 276m at the end of last year.
The sale is expected to reduce gearing to between 50 and 70 per cent
depending upon how the deal is structured and what further property
provisions the group decides to make at the end of this year.
Costain, which has been hit hard by the collapse of UK residential and
commercial property markets, incurred a Pounds 69.2m pre-tax loss last year.
It has already sold its UK commercial property portfolio for Pounds 101m in
a bid to reduce borrowings.
Originally it had planned to retain 51 per cent of the Australian coal
mining business, after floating the company. It has now decided to sell the
whole subsidiary.
Peabody became part of Hanson when the conglomerate acquired Consolidated
Goldfields at the end of the 1980s.
The attraction of Costain's coal mines in New South Wales are their long
term supply contracts with local electricity generators.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ptarmigan takes first step into
engineering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SHARES IN Ptarmigan were suspended
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
for the second time this year - at 2p on Friday, pending shareholders'
approval of a reorganisation.
The group, which operates hotels, makes artificial flowers and children's
hats, publishes illustrated books on cookery, crafts and cake decoration,
has taken the first step in a complete change of activity. It is currently
valued at Pounds 300,000.
It has conditionally agreed to acquire three engineering companies - Thomas
Eaves, HA Birch and Airmatic Engineering - from Prospect Industries for
Pounds 6.5m nominal of 4 per cent (gross) convertible redeemable secured
loan stock. The plan is to dispose of the existing Ptarmigan businesses and
acquire engineering companies in niche markets.
Ptarmigan also unveiled reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 735,000 (Pounds
2.67m restated and after Pounds 1.95m amortisation of goodwill) and losses
per share of 5.07p (22.92p) for the year to June 30. Turnover was Pounds
3.26m (Pounds 4.52m) and operating losses came to Pounds 444,000 (Pounds
169,000).
Mr Philip Wilbraham, chief executive of Prospect and its chairman since June
8 when Mr Richard Richardson resigned and was appointed executive chairman
of Ptarmigan, said the three companies were 'peripheral' to his company's
core. The disposal - subject to the approval of both sets of shareholders -
would reduce Prospect's borrowings by Pounds 800,000.
He said full conversion of the loan stock would give Prospect 52m Ptarmigan
shares, or 77.99 per cent of its equity. In that case the Takeover Panel
would waive the obligation on Prospect to make a general offer.
Mr Wilbraham was non-executive chairman of Ptarmigan until June 8, when Mr
Richardson arrived. On the same date Mr Colin Davies, chief executive and
finance director of Ptarmigan, resigned as non-executive director of
Prospect.
Ptarmigan's statement said: 'The acquisition agreement does not contain the
usual level of warranties and indemnities that a purchaser would expect to
obtain when purchasing a private group of companies. However . . . the
necessary conditions for continued bank support of Ptarmigan may not be
fulfilled and facilities not made available should the acquisitions not be
completed and, as a consequence, the company may be unable to continue
trading.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR LENNOX FYFE, chairman of the Co-operative Wholesale Society, delivered a
blistering attack on the government's economic policy when reporting a sharp
drop in interim profits at the weekend.
He said prospects of any real upturn in the retail sector still seemed very
far off. 'Indeed, the UK economy over the last month appears to have been
propelled by an indecisive government over the abyss into a state of free
fall,' he said.
The UK's biggest co-operative organisation, which has retained its strong
links with the Labour party, blamed the severity of the recession for a fall
in trading profits from Pounds 10.1m to Pounds 5.3m in the six months to
June 27. Sales rose from Pounds 1.43bn to Pounds 1.49bn.
The CWS, which is the UK's biggest farmer as well as a food manufacturer,
wholesaler to the rest of the co-operative movement, and a significant
retailer, said there had been some encouraging developments - particularly
in retail, travel and funeral services, and agricultural businesses.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Boost for military in China: Communist party central
committee elections reverse trend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHINESE Communist party yesterday elected its central committee,
ushering in a better educated leadership, notable for the absence of
nepotism, but with an enhanced role for the military.
The appointments to the party's central committee - the first since
pro-democracy demonstrations were put down in June 1989 - reversed a 15-year
trend of decline in the People's Liberation Army's membership of the party's
top decision-making body, diplomats said.
Admirals, generals and political commissars were among new members on the
committee, voted in at the end of the party's 14th Congress. Diplomats said
the rise in PLA representation underlined concern within the Communist party
that the economic reforms the party endorsed at the congress could lead to
civil unrest, especially if unemployment rises.
'They need to have the PLA on the party's side if things get out of hand,'
one noted last night.
The congress has been a triumph for the economic and political policies of
Deng Xiaoping, 88. In the past week Deng and his ideas have been lauded in
the official media, promoting China's pre-eminent leader to a status almost
higher than that of Mao Zedong.
The near 2,000 delegates voted unanimously to accept a report presented last
week by Jiang Zemin, party general secretary. In it Jiang said that China
would develop a 'socialist market economy', where prices were deregulated,
government would be taken out of state industry and foreign investment
encouraged.
The selection of the new members are in line with Deng's instructions to
choose leading officials who were 'revolutionary, young, knowledgeable and
specialised'.
The committee, expanded from 175 to 189 full members together with 130
alternates, saw a rise in provincial representation at the expense of the
central government. It also exhibited a bias towards the university-educated
and, by China's standards, the young. Nearly half are new faces.
The Xinhua news agency sought to emphasise the youth of the party's new
central committee and its ability to provide China's future leaders. It
noted 61 per cent of the committee members were below 55 years old.
This was 'evidence that the Communist party of China is full of vigour and
vitality and has a train of successors', it quoted 'sources' as saying.
None of the children of the party's elderly leaders was appointed to the
central committee, either as full or alternate members, despite intense
speculation beforehand that many, including Deng's daughter Deng Nan, would
be selected.
The congress dumped some ideological hardliners, and about 100 of the
outgoing committee's members stepped down to make way for the younger
officials.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Fresh pressure over Maxwell pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the government to rethink how it helps pensioners hurt by the
collapse of Maxwell businesses will intensify when parliament returns this
week, amid signs that fundraising over the summer has only bought time for
ministers.
The trust fund headed by Sir John Cuckney has raised Pounds 5.9m - regarded
as a significant achievement by the trust's operators but far short of the
tens of millions needed to fill gaps in pension funds robbed by the late
Robert Maxwell.
Sir John is believed to be pressing for a fresh appeal next year when
progress will have been made in the costly task of settling contested claims
on Maxwell assets.
Meanwhile, the influential Commons social security select committee is
expected to call soon for a pension compensation scheme, financed by the
pension industry, which could give retrospective help to Maxwell pensioners.
Its report will be in the form of a submission to the official inquiry by
Professor Roy Goode into pension law.
The committee resumes its inquiry into the Maxwell affair tomorrow by
questioning Lord Williams and Lord Donoghue, who were directors of Maxwell
investment companies. The committee has asked for specialist staff to be
seconded from the National Audit Office.
Sir John will report on his progress to the committee on October 28. His
evidence is likely to increase the moral pressure on ministers to accept
that, as the architects of the system of self regulation, the government
should give more financial help and a safety net for future victims of
pension fraud.
So far ministers have agreed only to provide Pounds 2.5m - which, together
with the trust fund, should mean no pensioners suffer financially for at
least two years.
But Maxwell pensioners, who will lobby parliament on November 4, remain
unhappy.
'The pensioners want long-term solutions not short-term panaceas,' said Mr
Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell pensioners action group. 'Pensioners
have been patient but feel militant at the government's failure to take away
the turmoil of not knowing when money for their pensions will run out.'
Contributions to the trust fund have been hit by recession and a fear that
making a donation implies liability - a suspicion Sir John has tried to
avert. Financial institutions and the top 500 companies were all lobbied.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, is under pressure from the
Treasury over his budget for 1993-94 which will make it difficult for him to
find extra help for Maxwell pensioners.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Government to urge tougher Bank role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is likely to recommend that the Bank of England become more
aggressive and adversarial in its supervision of banks, after Lord Justice
Bingham's report on the closure of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International which is due to be published on Thursday.
Lord Bingham's report is critical of the Bank of England's supervisory
department. But the Bank, which has a copy of the report, does not believe
the resignations of Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank director responsible for
supervision, or Mr Roger Barnes, the head of supervision, would be
justified.
Price Waterhouse, BCCI's auditor, is also braced for criticism, as is Abu
Dhabi, the Gulf state that was a long-standing investor in BCCI and its
majority shareholder at the time it closed. The UK Treasury, however, is
understood to escape serious criticism.
Lord Bingham was commissioned by the Treasury and the Bank of England to
investigate the role of UK authorities in the events leading to the closure
of BCCI in July 1991.
His report was completed several months ago, but the Treasury delayed its
publication until the resumption of parliament to avoid the risk that Lord
Bingham, recently appointed Master of the Rolls, could be sued by
disgruntled individuals mentioned in its pages. The report is being
published under parliamentary privilege, in the form of an answer to a
parliamentary question.
There are several criticisms levelled at the Bank of England, including:
It did not get closely enough involved in the attempt to restructure BCCI in
1991, relying instead on information passed to it by Price Waterhouse.
Senior officials at the Bank did not learn of the huge scale of the BCCI
fraud until June 1991, even though detailed information on the fraud had
been passed to the Bank early that year.
Bank officials expect to be told by the government that the supervisory
department needs to be more aggressive and interventionist. The Bank,
however, is convinced that losses of BCCI depositors would have been just as
big if BCCI had been closed a year earlier.
Price Waterhouse is prepared to be told that when it uncovered damaging
information about BCCI, it did not stress its importance sufficiently in
conversations with the Bank.
Abu Dhabi is concerned, on the basis of early drafts of the report, that it
will be accused of withholding information on the scale of the fraud, which
it allegedly uncovered in the spring of 1990. Abu Dhabi has argued strongly
to the government over the summer that such an accusation is unfair, since
the information it received at the time was unclear.

Having outperformed the market over the past two months Reuters share price
faltered last week, suggesting it may be due for a correction. Despite its
best efforts, the company has yet to convince the City that Globex, its new
out-of-hours trading system for futures and options, will be a real
money-spinner. In the context of a company with first-half profits of Pounds
187m, revenues from the project are still trifling. The lingering concern is
whether Globex will make a substantial contribution to earnings until well
into the second half of the decade.
Granted, the number of terminals installed appears to be on target and the
system's technical performance is well up to scratch. Yet revenue growth
from transaction charges is slow, due to low trading volume. Globex is not
the only weapon in Reuters' armoury, although the prospects for the Dealing
2000-2 foreign exchange trading system are equally obscure.
There is ample scope for cutting costs, but a price earnings multiple of 22
times last year's earnings demands a growth rate unlikely to come from
increased efficiency. The new focus on television, evidenced by the
company's involvement in the consortium bidding for ITN, makes strategic
sense but will hardly match the high margins and rapid growth which it has
enjoyed from financial market products. There is also the question of what
the company should do with its rising cash pile: distribution to
shareholders in the form of a higher dividend could be a sign Reuters is
abandoning its status as a growth stock.

FT  19 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Sema group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One can only stand back and admire the elegant way in which Paribas has
effectively transferred half its 39 per cent stake in the Anglo-French
computer services group Sema to France Telecom. Last week's transaction was
particularly sensitive because it had to be carefully constructed so as not
to offend UK Takeover Panel and Stock Exchange rules.
Thanks to the creation of a joint holding company for the stake - 50.1 per
cent owned by Paribas, 49.9 per cent owned by France Telecom - there is no
question of control of Sema having changed hands. The two investors' obvious
interest in acquiring Schneider's 10.5 per cent Sema stake is accommodated
by a six year put option which falls neatly within the Panel's regulations
on creeping control. The proposed asset swap between France Telecom and
Sema, meanwhile, does not breach the Stock Exchange rule on connected
parties and capital transactions since France Telecom is not directly
interested in a 10 per cent stake.
Paribas and France Telecom - notwithstanding Paribas' apparent intention to
divest - insist they will pay for any Schneider shares which come their way
in exact proportion to their interests in the holding company. No doubt
Paribas has a long term commitment to Sema. Nevertheless minority
shareholders would probably be happier if they had more precise details of
the prices negotiated between Paribas and France Telecom, and between these
two parties and Schneider. If the put option is fully exercised, after all,
the joint company will end up within a whisker of 50 per cent.

FT  19 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: European mergers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The pace of cross-border European mergers and acquisitions is always of keen
interest to corporate financiers. But the marked slowdown of M &amp; A activity
in the third quarter may contain a wider message for stock markets too. The
recent trend is most visible in provisional figures last week from KPMG.
These show that, compared with the first and second quarters of 1992, the
volume and value of deals involving target companies with their headquarters
in the European Community roughly halved in the three months to September.
It can, moreover, be no coincidence that the three transactions currently
being investigated in Brussels by the EC's Merger Task Force is the lowest
number on record.
Currency turbulence over the summer - heightening perceptions of financial
risk - no doubt partly explains the lull. The capacity of companies to
finance takeovers, moreover, will have been constrained by nervous banks and
wobbly share prices. One can just about imagine a successful capital-raising
on Wall Street; in the continued absence of any tangible sign of economic
recovery institutions must be distinctly wary of rights issues elsewhere.
Corporate deals tend to be a reliable lead indicator of stock market
activity. The question for investors is whether companies are genuinely
strapped for cash, or whether they believe that European asset values are
still inflated. The collapse in 1992 earnings forecasts - BZW expects
earnings of continental companies to rise just 2 per cent, against a 12 per
cent projection three months ago - is hardly auspicious.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What do the following dates have in common: October 13 1989, October 19
1987, October 18 1937, October 6 1932, October 29 1929, and September 18
1873? Dunce's caps for those who did not know they were the occasions of US
stock market collapses, and top of the class for those who are also aware of
other autumn falls. Indeed, of the 15 largest daily declines in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average since 1928, 10 have been between September 24 and
November 11.
For those of an astrological bent, such figures may have significance, but
there is also a more serious side to stock market crashes. Since 1987 much
attention has focused on what role, if any, derivative products played in
the crash. Futures and options do not create any net new risk, since for
every long position there is a short, but they do encourage speculators. If
such short term traders dominate a market they may increase volatility.
Extra short-term volatility, however, does not make crashes inevitable.
Because futures allow speculators to sell markets short as well as buy them,
derivatives may even lead to a more measured decline over a longer period
when a market is over-bought. In cash markets, fear may build up in holders
of shares who are reluctant to sell until a crash is triggered. Futures
pressure may provoke smaller bouts of selling earlier. Yet if history does
hold the lesson, those obsessed with autumn catastrophe may have the last
laugh. The South Sea Bubble burst between August and November 1720, and the
Dutch tulip mania peaked in November 1636.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Construction Contracts: CrossRail improvements at Royal Oak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FRANK GRAHAM has been awarded another civil engineering design contract by
CrossRail, this time for the covered way and ramp at the Royal Oak section
of the project in West London. This follows only six weeks after being
appointed for similar work at the Allen Gardens section, Shoreditch.
Commencing at the western portals of the bored tunnel drive 15 metres below
Paddington, the new work comprises a 350 metre section of cut and cover,
which may be carried out using continuous bored pile walls. This is followed
by a 200 metre long ramp which climbs, in open cut, to connect with tracks
at ground level.
The Royal Oak section is complicated by the fact that it passes under two
road bridges. The value of the construction work is estimated to be Pounds
11.5m on a March 1990 basis.
The CrossRail scheme, a joint development between London Underground and
British Rail Network SouthEast, involves building a twin-bore tunnel, 9.6
kms long, across central London between Paddington and Bethnal Green. This
will link rail lines to Reading and Aylesbury in the west and north-west to
those serving Shenfield in the East.
The Pounds 1.7bn scheme will greatly reduce journey times across the region
and relieve congestion on the Underground.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Construction Contracts: Wimpey wins Pounds 32m order for
Edinburgh retail development
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION SCOTLAND has been appointed management contractor on
Edinburgh's largest retail development, a Pounds 32.5m scheme to build the
Gyle shopping centre on the South Gyle Broadway in the city centre.
The contract has been awarded to Wimpey by a consortium of clients
comprising the high street retailers Marks and Spencer and Asda, and McLagan
Investments.
Wimpey will complete the complex in six phases, with retailers moving in by
October of next year.
Along with 120,000 sq ft of multi-occupancy units, the key elements of the
phased scheme include a 70,000 sq ft store for Asda and a 110,000 sq ft
retail outlet for Marks and Spencer.
The steel-frame building will be enveloped in cavity blockwork walls at the
lower levels with flat metal cladding to the ceiling.
The entrance elevation will be glazed, as will the 920ft-long mall, bringing
natural light to the heart of the shopping complex. The Gyle will be topped
with a combination of pitched and flat roofs.
Wimpey will also complete the fit-out, including the mechanical and
electrical installation to all the common and shared areas. Aside from a
network of security installations which includes CCTV, the shopping centre
will be fully equipped with up-to-date fire detection devices, such as a
sprinkler and alarm system.
Pre-construction groundwork requires importing material for upfill so that
appropriate site levels can be achieved. the ground will be strengthened
with 2,000 driven cast in-situ piled foundations and a reinforced concrete
ground slab.
Wimpey's parners on the project are MJSR as architect, Greeds as quantity
surveyor, Montague Evans as letting agents and Bovis Construction as project
manager.
The concept architect was Edinburgh-based Comprehensive Design, the
landscape architect was I. White and McIlroy Coates was the graphic
designer.

EDMUND NUTTALL has been awarded a motorway lane rental contract by
Buckinghamshire County Council, as agent for the Department of Transport,
with a value of over Pounds 5m.
Spread over 23 kilometres of the M1 motorway through Buckinghamshire and
into Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire, the scheme runs from Junction 13 to
a point 10 kilometres north of the Newport Pagnell service area. The
contract combines nine kilometres of central reservation hardening with
about 170,000 sq metres of wearing course replacement.
Included in the contract work is the upgrading of the motorway lighting
system with a total of 182 lighting columns to be erected.
Edmund Nuttall completed a similar lighting contract on the Ml/M6 for
Leicestershire County Council earlier in the year.
Another interesting feature of the contract will be the quantity of safety
barrier. At almost 20,000 linear metres of open box beam, the subcontract
will be one of the largest barrier contracts in the country this year.
Supervising the contract will be Buckinghamshire County Engineer's
Department, and work is due to start in October.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Means to a public spending end: The case for targeting
pensions and child benefits at the most needy is becoming harder to resist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the government struggles to control the UK's growing public expenditure,
increasing attention is focusing on the Pounds 76bn in next year's budget
for social security. At more than 30 per cent of the total, it is the
largest single item of spending, and more than double the amount spent on
education, health or defence.
Yet the scope for scaling back spending on social security is limited by
pledges on the state pension and child benefit in the Conservative election
manifesto. This promised that the two benefits, which together account for
half the social security budget, would not only continue to be paid on the
current basis but would also be increased each year in line with inflation.
The logic of this has been challenged by some ministers and advisers. The
state pension and child benefit are both universal benefits - flat-rate
payments made to all who qualify regardless of need. Why continue to pay
these expensive benefits to rich and poor alike, the argument goes, while
stinting capital programmes which might enhance the long-term economic
prospects of the country?
Earlier this month, Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, told the
Tory party conference that he was prepared to see greater targeting 'to
focus benefits on the most needy'. However, it appears that what Mr Lilley
has in mind is means-testing invalidity benefit, paid to 1.4m long-term sick
and disabled people, rather than the more expensive pension and child
benefit.
Yet there could be significant savings if the government were to end the
universal payment of the state pension. This is a flat-rate payment of
Pounds 54 a week for single people, Pounds 87 for a married couple, given to
all pensioners who paid enough national insurance contributions during their
working life.
The cost of paying the state pension to almost all pensioners is enormous;
at Pounds 27bn next year, it accounts for more than 10 per cent of public
expenditure. Yet despite the cost, it is inadequate for many pensioners to
live on.
For example, 1.4m pensioners need to top up their state pension with
means-tested income support. Another 2m qualify for housing benefit to help
with rent and 3m depend on community charge benefit to pay some or all of
their poll tax. Almost half of all pensioners still receive means-tested
benefits to top up their state pension.
However, the number who depend on income support has been falling, according
to Mr Andrew Dilnot, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. 'The idea
that all pensioners are living in dire poverty is outdated,' he says.
One in 20 pensioner households is in the top 20 per cent of UK households in
terms of disposable income and one in eight is in the top 40 per cent. Most
of the income of these 'woopies' (well-off older people) comes from
occupational pensions and savings. The richest 20 per cent of pensioner
households in 1989 had an average gross income of Pounds 14,710, of which
just Pounds 2,800 came from the state pension.
The better-off minority can be expected to grow, says Mr Dilnot: 'More than
two-thirds of men now retiring have some occupational pension income - and
this averages Pounds 65 a week. And nearly half of all women approaching
retirement age have some sort of occupational pension rights of their own in
addition to any widow's benefits they would get from their husband's
scheme.'
Better targeting of the state pension could divert the money from the
minority of better-off pensioners to the most needy pensioners - and perhaps
save some of the Pounds 27bn budget. One option would be to target the state
pension on older pensioners. They are much more likely than their younger
colleagues to be at the bottom end of UK income distribution, since they
retired when occupational pensions were less common. However, as the
generation currently retiring with substantial alternative income grows
older, paying extra to the over-75s would soon become just as untargeted as
universal benefits for younger pensioners now are.
The alternative would be to switch to means-testing. This could not be
introduced overnight. Even wealthy pensioners will have made plans on the
assumption that they will receive the state pension - and it would be unjust
to sweep this away suddenly. The same applies to those approaching
retirement who may have counted on the state pension for their old age.
Any change to means-testing would, therefore, have to be phased in over a
number of years. However, the current level of pension might be frozen for
those already receiving it, rather than increasing it in line with
inflation. Some of the almost Pounds 1bn saved could be used to increase
means-tested benefits for the very poorest, with the rest contributing to
the reduction in public expenditure. In future years, much greater savings
would be available if the frozen pension was completely phased out with a
further switch to means-tested benefits.
Similar considerations apply to child benefit, the payment made to all
parents of dependent children irrespective of income. The level is Pounds
9.65 a week for the first child, Pounds 7.80 for each subsequent child (lone
parents get Pounds 5.85 a week extra for the first child). The total cost of
child benefit will be Pounds 6.3bn next year.
Child benefit can make an important contribution to family well-being in
low-income households. In 1989, for example, it contributed 8 per cent on
average of the gross income of the poorest 20 per cent of two-parent,
two-children families. For the poorest 20 per cent of lone-parent families,
child benefit accounted for over a fifth of their gross income.
As with the state pension, the level of child benefit is insufficient to
lift these poorer families out of poverty. The average gross income of the
poorest 20 per cent of two-parent, two-child families was Pounds 9,000 a
year in 1989, half the average for all non-retired households. For the
poorest 20 per cent of lone-parent families, average gross income was just
under Pounds 4,000 a year.
However, child benefit goes to many families in the upper end of the income
distribution. One in six families is in the top 20 per cent of UK households
in terms of disposable income, and two-fifths are in the top 40 per cent.
Better targeting could redirect the money from these better-off families to
those for which current levels of benefit are insufficient to raise their
income above poverty levels, as well as perhaps reducing the overall cost of
child benefit.
Despite the savings which might be made, there are two difficulties in
moving towards greater use of means-testing: take-up and the impact on
incentives. Means-tested benefits notoriously suffer from low take-up,
either because people do not know they are entitled to claim them, or
because of the stigma attached to applying for them.
'While child benefit reaches virtually all parents,' according to Ms Fran
Bennett, director of the Child Poverty Action Group, 'the latest survey into
the take-up of means-tested family credit for low-income families suggests
that only half of those entitled to it were actually receiving it.'
Part of the reason for this appears to be that many of the people who do not
apply for means-tested benefits would be entitled to relatively small
amounts or would qualify for only short periods of time. Any shift away from
universal benefits would have to make much greater efforts to ensure that
means-tested benefits reach more of those who need them.
Means-testing also has damaging effects on incentives. Typically,
means-tested benefits such as family credit or housing benefit are reduced
by 70p or 80p for each extra Pounds 1 of net income. This gradual withdrawal
of means-tested benefits can combine with income tax and other deductions to
leave the individual little better off and in some cases worse off as his or
her income rises.
The Department of Social Security estimates that last year 660,000 people on
means-tested benefits lost 70 per cent or more of each additional Pounds 1
of income. A small number of people in work would have been better off if
unemployed.
The disincentive effects can be just as damaging for savings, since any
sensible means test must take account of capital as well as income. Under
the present means test for family credit, for example, no benefit is paid to
anyone with more than Pounds 8,000 of capital (other than the value of their
home and certain other assets).
People with less than Pounds 8,000 of capital are assumed to earn Pounds 1 a
week in interest for every Pounds 250 over Pounds 3,000. This imputed
interest rate is more than 20 per cent a year, much higher than could
possibly be earned on it. Such an approach encourages those who might
qualify for means-tested benefits to spend their capital or invest in assets
such as a home which are not assessed for the means test. The consequences
could be particularly damaging if the state pension was means-tested,
offering a disincentive to save for retirement at a time when the government
is anxious to promote personal pensions.
'Any move to means-testing for the pension would need to make sure that the
return to private saving is not depressed excessively,' warns Mr Dilnot.
Even if difficulties over take-up and incentives could be resolved, however,
there remains the problem of the government's manifesto promises. A freeze
in the state pension or child benefit or a switch towards means-testing
would mean abandoning those promises.
But if the Conservative government is unwilling to move towards
means-testing, it could find itself uncomfortably outflanked from the left.
Some leading Labour figures - including Bill Morris of the powerful TGWU
general workers' union - have been urging the party to consider such a
switch as part of the rethink after last April's election defeat. Labour
then promised rises in the state pension and child benefit which would have
cost over Pounds 3.5bn a year and required tax increases. Some party
strategists are toying with a more selective approach to benefits, a
fundamental change of approach for a party which has tenaciously defended
universal benefits since the creation of the welfare state.
There is little sign so far that the government is prepared to follow suit
in such radical rethinking - hence ministers' focus on benefits for the
long-term sick and disabled which are not protected by manifesto
commitments. But with pressure on public expenditure now growing, criticism
of universal benefits is likely to become increasingly difficult to resist.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Personal View: No Teflon for Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES ANNABLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
George Bush must be asking himself what went wrong. Why are voters so angry?
Can the problem be fixed? Or must he face the ignominy of becoming only the
second elected incumbent to lose the presidency in 60 years?
The answer to the first question is the economy. Polls reveal a widespread
belief that the economy performed poorly under Mr Bush's stewardship. The
White House, somewhat peevishly, argues that conclusion is unfair and
inaccurate.
The evidence provides some comfort for the president's defenders. When Mr
Ronald Reagan was running for re-election in 1984, the unemployment rate
average was 7.6 per cent and inflation was 4.6 per cent. The sum of the two
rates, the famous misery index, was 12.3. During the first eight months of
1992, the jobless rate was 7.4 per cent and inflation 2.9 per cent, a more
modest misery index of 10.3.
Moreover, federal debt nearly tripled in the Reagan years, three separate
tax increases were enacted and the federal budget was in a chronic state of
confrontation, stalemate and missed deadlines.
Today, however, the White House has lost the Reagan magic, because it has no
favourable answer to Mr Reagan's central campaign question of 1980: are you
better off than you were five years ago? It was Reagan's genius to
understand the political power of that question.
To gauge public satisfaction with the economy, I have constructed a measure
of 'feel-good' consumption (see table). This somewhat arbitrary measure
subtracts from per capita consumption those categories that contribute
little to consumer satisfaction: outlays for household utilities, some
transport costs (including commuting expenses and car repair), medical costs
(including insurance premiums), legal fees and private education.
The Reagan years are instructive. The high unemployment, tax increases, poor
productivity, collapsing trade balance, breakdown in fiscal responsibility
and even the occasional nap at a cabinet meeting did not matter much when
feel-good consumption was rising so fast. It was the key ingredient in Mr
Reagan's celebrated Teflon.
By contrast, with falling feel-good consumption during Bush's presidency, it
matters less to be the hero of Kuwait and to have presided over the end of
the cold war.
Mr Bush must manage his presidency without Teflon. His problem of lagging
living standards is not amenable to quick fixes such as easier credit.
In the 1980s, sharp increases in the federal deficit, in the trade deficit
and in foreign borrowing helped feel-good consumption return to robust
growth rates. In effect, the US was propping up its living standards with a
flood of imports and a mountain of debt.
That game cannot be played indefinitely. Consumption growth faster than
total output growth is inherently temporary. Foreign debts must be serviced
and the trade deterioration reversed. The process is symmetrical. To make
room for the accelerated growth in exports and the slowdown in imports,
consumption growth must lag the overall economy. The correction process has
already begun. Since 1988, feel-good consumption has declined while real
exports have risen at a strong 7 per cent annual rate.
Without increases in domestic and foreign debt to support consumption
growth, gains in living standards will again be governed by productivity
growth, which has lagged badly in the past 20 years. US economic policy,
therefore, is at a fork in the road. One direction continues high public
deficits, low private saving and investment, poor productivity growth, and
slow gains in living standards. The other involves reducing the public
deficit, higher private saving and investment, rising productivity growth,
and (with a lag) accelerating increases in living standards.
The political key to the apparently attractive second option is the lag
between higher saving and higher consumption. It could be eight years or
more before higher saving and investment would result in more robust growth
in feel-good consumption; in the meantime, living standards would be even
lower than in the first option.
As a result, no matter what national economic policy is adopted, feel-good
consumption will fall short of public expectations in the 1990s. And it will
be even tougher in 1996 to run for president representing the incumbent
party. As former secretary of state Mr George Shultz once observed: 'An
economist's lag may be a politician's catastrophe.'

FT  19 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Crashes, big and small
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE years to the day after Black Monday, the 1987 stock market crash looks
a much less awesome affair than it did at the time. The colour black, as
applied to days of the week, has been somewhat devalued by subsequent
events; the plunge in property values and the 1990s' slow-motion collapse in
Japanese shares have made 1987 look like a sideshow.
Yet the sheer speed of the 1987 market slide, in which equity prices across
the world lost a quarter of their value in a day and a half, continues to
fascinate.
Looking back, it is easy to forget the climate of the time: this was a
feel-good decade for investors. The Reagan administration brought a
reassertion of American influence in the world, together with an
overwhelming fiscal boost to the global economy. An ideological commitment
to markets was gaining ground against the interventionist orthodoxy of
previous years. Deregulation, privatisation and falling top marginal tax
rates were a la mode.
A protracted economic recovery was marked by a significant boost in profits
in many countries. Commodity prices were weak. Yet the transformation from
boom to bubble arose, as always, from monetary policy.
Monetary conditions in the developed world became more relaxed in
mid-decade. Then came the Louvre Accord in February 1987 and the
co-operative attempt to prop up the dollar. The result was a flood of
liquidity into the markets. British equities, for example, rose nearly 50
per cent in the 12 months before the crash.
If any single event was responsible for changing market perceptions, it was
the row between the US and Germany over monetary policy, which coincided
with appalling US trade figures. It suddenly looked as though the US was
about to embark on more restrictive policies.
The speed of the subsequent market adjustment no doubt reflected the
enormously increased importance of professional investors since 1929. But
the more important point was that the markets were right. Within months it
was clear that demand in the developed world had been accelerating at an
unsustainable rate. Within a couple of years the economic gains of the
decade looked less substantial. Increased consumption in the Anglo-Saxon
economies had been financed by a run-down of household savings and an
accumulation of debt. The US remained prey to a long-run productivity
crisis. Japan, the world's second largest economy, had continued to invest
at a rate appropriate to a developing country, to nugatory effect. Banks
everywhere were fragile.
Central bankers were unquestionably justified in pumping short-term
liquidity into the markets and arm-twisting banks to stop calling in
collateral as prices plunged. The mistake, most notably in Britain and
Japan, was to keep monetary policy loose for too long after the event,
thereby giving leverage a final fling. The wider message might be that
markets are better at acknowledging their mistakes than ministers. The size
of the present financial hangover bears eloquent testimony to that.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Mr Major's medium term
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major faces the most critical week of his political career. Having
lost overboard his foreign and economic policies in the ERM storms of
mid-September, his plans to close over half of Britain's coal industry have
brought something close to mutiny. This has perhaps less to do with the
plans themselves than with the fact that they come at the depth of a
recession to which people can see no end.
He now faces calls not only to remove his chancellor, but also his trade and
industry secretary, Mr Michael Heseltine, whose department is responsible
for coal. Something close to hysteria has swept through the conservative
shires, and normally loyal supporters are openly querying his ability to
lead the government.
Amid this clamour, it is worth recalling the judgments the Conservative
party and the country made in electing Mr Major to Number 10 Downing Street
only six months ago.
To his party, Mr Major promised to heal as best he could the schism over
Europe, to scrap his predecessor's disastrous poll tax and to continue the
medium-term quest for a low-inflation base for a competitive British
economy. To the country, he offered a less divisive tone than Mrs Thatcher,
a renewed emphasis upon the quality of public services and a low-tax
alternative to a Labour party which was still not trusted.
Above all, Mr Major acquired a striking personal popularity, based upon
three aspects of his 'honest John' character: an instinctive aversion to the
more rabid ideologies; a doggedness to see through calmly a difficult task;
and a low-key, plain-speaking manner which proclaimed integrity and realism.
These qualities were especially admired during the Gulf war and the election
campaign itself.
It was clear from Mr Major's press conference in Birmingham after the
European summit last Friday that this is the style of leadership he intends
to continue to offer.
Complex task
He deeply regrets the pain caused by the pit closures, but there is no
medium term future in piling up millions of tons of un-saleable coal at the
pithead. The prospects for the economy remain difficult, especially given
deteriorating conditions in Germany and Japan, but there is no medium- term
future in attempting to dash for growth, only to reel backwards into
stagflation. On the EC, Britain must remain an important member while using
its influence to ensure that the Community neither recklessly pursues
political and economic ambitions beyond its means, nor turns its back on the
rest of the world.
When it comes to the coal industry, Mr Major is right to assert that the
British economy cannot afford, medium term, to carry the costs of
uncompetitive energy. If Germany thinks it can, then let it continue doing
so as long as EC law permits. It is, of course, true that the pressures on
coal have been intensified by a mishandled privatisation which created an
inadequately competitive electricity industry.
But it is also worth remembering that it has taken all the privatised
utilities and their regulators a period of years to feel their way towards
more efficient arrangements, a complex task which is far from complete; in
British Telecom alone, this process has cost 80,000 jobs since
privatisation. Coal miners have a unique place in the affections of the
British people and many of their communities are uniquely exposed to a
single industry. This is why there is such widespread anger at the
government's failure to justify more persuasively the speed of the cuts,
which may even now have to be spread over a longer period. But even emotion
fanned by the moral indignation of bishops cannot alter the laws of
economics.
Sense of direction
The question is: can Mr Major meet the challenges he faces? There is no
doubt that his credibility has been severely damaged. The manner of
Britain's exit from the ERM and the memory of his chancellor's promises of
imminent economic recovery have combined with the fear or experience of
unemployment to make the British people doubt that Mr Major can deliver.
Partly this is a question of political skills and the prime minister needs,
as he did during the election campaign, to take more of the burden of
persuasion upon himself. But the central question is whether Mr Major has
what it takes to lead; to weld a fractious party which has been so long in
power into an effective force with a clear idea of what it wants for the
future; to put an end to the feeling that his government is merely
responding to events; to demonstrate that he has a sense of direction .
To this end, he must now recognise that having lost the credibility of the
ERM, the country requires a medium-term strategy for the economy in which it
can learn to believe. So far, his unwillingness even to acknowledge the
debate about institutional reform of the mechanisms for setting monetary
policy suggests that he is not truly engaged in the thinking needed to
support his stated political and economic objectives. Such a strategy also
implies a clear view on the balance between fiscal and monetary policy,
involving lower interest rates and, if necessary, higher taxes.
That we are still so far from a credible economic package of this kind is Mr
Major's most grievous failure in the last month. If he can show that he is
capable of filling this vacuum firmly and swiftly, he will deserve support.
His backbenchers should then recognise that the accomplishment of this task
is more important than anything else.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Management: From feudalism to federalism - The fashionable
concept of the 'information-based organisation' is largely a fantasy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does your company suffer from anarchy, feudalism or utopianism in the way it
deals with information? If so, you need to replace the offending regime with
one which is better at managing the politics of information: either a
monarchy or, best of all, a federation.
You can determine your company's position on this spectrum quite easily. If
small departments and even individuals run their own databases, and have a
free hand in deciding what information they will give to whom, you have
anarchy.
If much larger business units or divisions hoard information and fail to
communicate properly with each other, and even with head office, you are a
victim of feudalism. If the company is riddled with blind faith in some
technological paradise in which information flows around freely, you have
utopianism.
On the other hand, if information management is dictated by the chief
executive, you are part of a monarchy. And if the nature and availability of
information is negotiated between the various potentially warring parties,
you are in the best state of all, a federation.
This categorisation of 'information politics', plus advice on how to handle
them, comes courtesy of three American business academics, Thomas Davenport,
Robert Eccles and Laurence Prusack, in the autumn 1992 issue of Sloan
Management Review, published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The trio is thoroughly cynical about the impact that information technology
has had - or failed to have - on companies over the past decade. The
'information-based organisation' may have been one of the most popular
management concepts of the 1980s, yet the academics claim that today it is
largely a fantasy. 'The rhetoric and technology of information management
have far outpaced the ability of people to understand and agree on what
information they need, and then to show it,' they add.
Having studied the attempts of 25 companies to create entire
information-based organisations, or even just to implement significant
information management initiatives, the researchers conclude that many of
their efforts have failed, or are on the path to failure.
The primary reason for failure was that companies did not manage the
politics of information. Either the initiative was inappropriate for the
company's overall political culture, or politics were treated as peripheral,
rather than integral to the initiative. Contrary to what many other
academics have forecast, Davenport, Eccles and Prusack say that politics
come increasingly into play as information and knowledge become more
important to a company. 'In the most information-oriented companies we
studied, people were least likely to share information freely . . . When
information is the primary unit of organisational currency, we should not
expect its owners to give it away.'
Of the 25 companies studied, about half suffered from information feudalism,
almost a third from utopianism, and a handful from anarchy. The positive
approaches of monarchy and federalism were each practised by slightly fewer
companies than was feudalism. Most practised more than one approach, either
to hedge their bets, or because they had not yet converted fully to
federalism.
Explaining why federalism is generally more effective than monarchy, the
academics say it recognises the importance of information politics, rather
than trying to suppress them. IBM, the computer giant, has been trying to
shift in this direction, although it is finding the complicated negotiation
process extremely time consuming.
Federalism is also more flexible than monarchy, say the academics, because
it encourages both autonomy and co-ordination in the management of
information, depending which is most appropriate for the particular
requirements or circumstances of the situation.
Among a series of tips on how to manage information politics within a
federal approach, the academics say that the selection of the right
'information politicians' is vital. This role - not as the owner of
information but as the manager with primary responsibility for facilitating
its effective use - is still up for grabs in many companies, despite the
widespread existence of people with titles such as 'chief information
officer'.
Until recently, most chief information officers were selected for technical
acumen rather than political skills. But few embarked on initiatives to
improve the way that information - not just information technology - is used
and managed. Only a few information systems heads 'have the political clout
to persuade powerful barons to share their information for the good of the
entire kingdom', the academics report. The same applies to chief financial
officers.
At more far-sighted companies such as IBM, Xerox, Kodak and Merrill Lynch,
recent corporate information heads have been fast-track executives with
records of managing important non-technical aspects of the business. Such
people have a better chance than most of identifying and managing the
politics of information, the academics conclude. Until this is done,
companies will not move into the 'information age', they say.
'No amount of data modelling, no number of relational databases, and no
invocation of 'the information-based organisation' will bring about a new
political order of information,' say Davenport, Eccles and Prusack. Rather,
'it will take what politics always take: negotiation, influence-exercising,
backroom deals, coalition-building, and occasionally even war'.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Management: Construction groups shaken to the foundations -
The rush to rebuild an industry, hard hit by the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like the crew of a sinking ship, Britain's recession-racked construction
companies are busy hurling overboard anything they do not need to keep
themselves afloat.
Jobs, plants and entire businesses are being jettisoned in a desperate
battle for survival as executives struggle to raise cash to lighten
debt-laden balance sheets.
Overheads, representing hundreds of thousands of jobs, have been chopped,
excess capacity shut down and unwanted buildings and non-core businesses
sold, often at a loss. As a result, businesses may look very different when
eventually they reach calmer waters.
For some it will mean returning to the kind of operations they ran at the
end of the 1970s when profits largely came from building and civil
engineering contracting.
Gone, or much reduced, will be the large speculative house building and
commercial property businesses into which contractors expanded during the
1980s - and which caused them so much trouble when the recession struck.
Also, up for sale are many of the non-construction activities acquired to
provide shelter against a downturn in building and property markets.
As well as raising cash, managers are reshaping their businesses to take
account of changed economic circumstances.
Tarmac, Britain's biggest housebuilder, plans by the end of next year to
have reduced capital employed in its housing operations to just Pounds 300m
from a peak of Pounds 800m three years ago. The company, also a building
materials producer, is pulling out of speculative commercial property
development altogether.
Neville Simms, chief executive, says the group is seeking to raise a total
of more than Pounds 300m from disposals.
Construction companies, also, are reducing the amount of money tied up in
expensive housing land. Sir Lawrie Barratt, brought out of retirement last
year to rescue Barratt Development, Britain's third largest housebuilder,
says the company will in future hold about two years' supply of land,
instead of three years' as is customary in the industry.
Sir Lawrie has made substantial savings by cutting the company's stock of
unsold and part-exchange houses and by sale and leaseback of show homes.
Costain Group provides one of the best examples of a UK contractor which
radically altered the mix of its businesses during the 1980s, subsequently
fell on hard times, and is now trying to regroup around its original
construction business.
Building and civil engineering in 1980 generated more than three quarters of
Costain's profits. By 1988 its share of record pre-tax profits had shrunk to
a fifth. The bulk of earnings came from housebuilding, commercial property
and coal mining operations which Costain had built up during the decade.
Four years later the group has been forced to sell its commercial property
portfolio for Pounds 101m. House building, which in 1988 built almost 2,000
houses, produced just 400 homes last year. And, this summer Costain
announced plans to sell its profitable Australian coal mining business.
John Laing, currently constructing a Pounds 300m privately-financed toll
bridge across the River Severn, plans to take Pounds 20m a year out of its
house-building operations over the next three years. Martin Laing, chairman,
says the company will return to its roots and concentrate on traditional
building and civil engineering.
'The advantage of contracting for large companies,' according to Laing, 'is
that overheads are very low, most of actual work is done by others, and cash
is paid up front, so that main contractors can earn interest on it before
passing it on to the sub-contractors.'
The result is a low margin business with a strong cash flow. Earnings and
dividends, as a result, are unlikely to recapture their previous heights
even when the economy recovers.
For the moment, some contractors are taking on work at a loss just to keep
cash flowing to pay wages and stay in business.
More company failures are expected by the industry as opportunities to win
work continue to shrink.
The Building Employers Confederation says that by the end of this year
450,000 construction jobs will have disappeared since summer 1989. This
represents 580 jobs lost for each working day.
Prices charged by construction companies have fallen by up to 30 per cent
since the late 1980s, according a to survey of contractors, their customers
and construction professionals conducted this summer by the Financial Times
and EC Harris international cost consultants.
The outlook for the industry remains stormy.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (6): Interest rates stand sky
high - 'Bashing the banks' may start soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNLIKE in the UK, 'bashing the banks' has not yet entered the vocabulary of
most Italian industrialists, in spite of the growing domestic recession.
However, the heady climb in interest rates since the Danish 'no' vote on the
Maastricht treaty in June, which plunged Europe's financial markets into
turmoil, is already taking its toll on the corporate sector; companies
complain of much tougher conditions and revising their 1992 earnings
forecasts downwards.
Interest rates in Italy now stand at astronomical levels, even for a country
used to elevated borrowing costs during the high inflation period of the
1970s. One big Milanese bank's 'prime rate' for top-class borrowers has
reached at 17 per cent, while riskier creditors have to pay the so-called
'top rate' of 23 per cent. For borrowers exceeding their agreed overdraft
limits, the maximum rate is two percentage points higher.
Despite such vertiginous figures and the lira's gyrations after leaving the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, there is little
sign as yet of a backlash from industry. Nor do many businessmen seem to be
accusing the banks of 'profiteering' at their expense.
The explanation is partly structural. Many Italian companies, especially
those owned privately, rely on retained profits for a large proportion of
their financing, compared with the generally much higher levels of gearing
seen in the UK and US.
The range of companies' banking relationships may also play a part in
clarifying why Italian business are not, as yet, complaining of a 'cultural
gap' with their bankers.
Even a medium-sized Italian company tends to have a much broader choice of
banking relationships than a like-sized counterpart in most other European
countries. According to the chief economist of one leading commercial bank,
the average medium-sized Italian concern has 12 bank relationships. In the
case of a multinational like Fiat, Italy's biggest private-sector group, the
figure would be between 100 and 200.
That has in the past allowed corporate borrowers, even of relatively modest
dimensions, to be fairly choosy when it cames to picking banks. Matters have
been reinforced by the rules governing overdraft facilities in Italy. 'The
fact that the great majority of Italian overdrafts are non-committed - so
banks can notionally withdraw them at minimum notice - means no commitment
fees are charged. The upshot of that has been to encourage companies to
negotiate relatively high overdraft ceilings, which are seldom used.
Moreover, such arrangements are made with a number of banks, meaning that
companies have had considerable cash at their disposal', says the economist.
Until the recent economic downturn, that tended to place relatively liquid
corporate borrowers at an advantage over their bankers. 'In some cases,
banks would compete with one another by offering bigger credit lines. And in
certain instances, borrowers could play one bank off against another to edge
down interest rates or gain better conditions', he adds.
The 'polarisation' of the market between a powerful group of liquid
companies and their bankers on the one hand and the considerably different
relationship between weaker companies and the banks on the other probably
reached a peak in the middle of this year, before the markets went into
disarray and interest rates started to soar.
While banks reported heady lending growth to corporate customers, with
annual rates of expansion for credits of up to 20 per cent, not all the cash
lent was being used for industrial purposes, in a model bearing some
similarities to the speculative circle that built up in Japan in the late
1980s.
Explains one banker 'From around 1988, the rate of banks' loan growth has
been running around twice that of Italy's gross domestic product. While some
companies needed the money for their business, more liquid concerns found
they could make an attractive spread by reinvesting borrowed funds in a
variety of financial instruments'.
Italian government bonds were the most popular. Figures from the Bank of
Italy show that, at end-91, over L41,000bn in cash from non-financial
companies was invested in the bond market. A further L45,700bn was ploughed
into foreign shares or bonds.
Matters changed sharply after this summer's currency turmoil. 'Now it's
become a sellers' market', says one banker. 'Profits are falling, leaving
less money to plough back into the business than before. Meanwhile,
creditors are taking much longer to pay their invoices. So companies are
becoming much less liquid and having to rely more on their banks
accordingly'.
Bankers admit the rates they charge depend partly on a company's location.
At one top Milanese bank, 27 per cent of all corporate loans carry the prime
interest rate of 17 per cent, while only around a tenth of the total pay the
23 per cent 'top rate'. But there is a marked geographic split between the
rates being paid in the north against those in southern Italy. On average,
corporate borrowers in southern italy were charged between 4 per cent and 5
per cent more for their money than their northern counterparts.
'The gap reflects the fact that there are fewer banks in the south, and
hence less competition. It also testifies to the greater risk of lending to
south Italian companies, which, on average, tend to be less solid
financially than their northern colleagues', says the banker.
Surprisingly, most banks say they are not yet worried about a major
deterioration in the quality of their loans as a result of the recession.
Signs of an economic downturn were already visible from the middle of last
year, and bankers claim they have been much more cautious since.
Moreover, despite this summer's surge in interest rates and the growing
domestic recession, many bankers expect the lira's devaluation to help the
corporate sector given the high export quotas of many Italian companies.
'The average Italian concern exports 20 per cent of its turnover', says the
bank economist. 'Obviously, the precise effect will depend on the exact
breakdown of a company's foreign turnover. Those selling to countries like
the UK, whose currencies have appreciated relatively little against the
lira, will receive less of a boost than those selling to Germany or the US'.
According to his calculations, based on a 10 per cent lira devaluation
against a basket of currencies and a rise of 5 per cent in domestic costs
next year, the lira's slide should lead to an average 20 per cent rise in
companies' gross operating profits in 1993. In the circumstances, the
relative harmony between companies and their bankers is easier to
understand.

ITALY'S small businesses, whose flexibility has pulled the country out of
recession several times since the second world war, are facing a serious
threat as high interest rates and rising labour costs reduce their ability
to remain competitive at home and abroad.
Small- to medium-sized companies are the life-blood of Italy's economy. They
account for an estimated 70 per cent of industry's total sales and about 40
per cent of exports.
Confindustria, Italy's employers' federation, estimates that companies with
fewer than 20 employees make up 95 per cent of all Italian companies and
employ 36 per cent of the industrial workforce. Companies with fewer than
100 employees are estimated to account for 99 per cent of all companies and
employ 59 per cent of the industrial workforce.
The combined strength of these small companies - most of them the fruits of
first-generation entrepreneurs - is all the more admirable in view of the
lack of interest that successive post-war Italian governments have shown in
them. Indeed, the nation's industrial policy has focused on big companies,
both in the state and private sectors.
But Italy's entrepreneurs have become increasingly frustrated that almost no
government help has been forthcoming in their hour of need. They want the
government to acknowledge and base its economic policies on the fact that
Italy's economic future lies in industry, especially in small businesses,
and not, for example, in tourism or agriculture.
A survey of 355 companies with an average of 36 employees commissioned by
Confapi, the Italian confederation of small and medium-sized industry,
showed that in the half of 1992 many small companies were experiencing
financial difficulties because of the rise in interest rates.
The difficult financial situation was compounded by continued weakness in
the domestic economy in the six-month period; both exports and domestic
orders showed a decline.
Labour costs rose by an average 3.74 per cent in the first half, the survey
noted, but Confapi officials said prospects in this area had improved since
abolition, at the end of July, of Italy's scala mobile wage indexation
system.
Indeed, Italy's increasingly rigid labour laws and the rise in employers'
contributions to the state over the past decade are mainly to blame for the
loss of flexibility and competitiveness of small businesses.
For a company with annual sales of up to L5bn (Pounds 2.3m), the labour
costs per employee rose by 79 per cent to L29.7m (Pounds 13,884) between
1982 and 1988, while a company with sales of between L25bn to L100bn saw
labour costs per employee jumped by about 90 per cent in the same period, to
between L35.7m (Pounds 16,690) and L37.9m (Pounds 17,718).
But what is perhaps more worrying for small businesses is that the advance
in technology can no longer help them to remain competitive. In the early
1980s, technology concentrated on individual machines which resulted in some
degree of convergence in productivity between big and small companies. But
technology has now progressed to such an extent that entire manufacturing
systems to replace dozens of workers are being produced.
In the 1980s, small businesses tended to invest in machinery which increased
their productive capacity rather than levels of efficiency. The disadvantage
of this decision can now be felt as productivity levels slow down.
Another problem facing small companies today is that an increased number of
them have become dependent on larger companies for most of their orders. The
percentage of sub-contractors among companies with between 10 and 100
employees had risen from 45.5 per cent in 1978 to 57.7 per cent in 1984 and
is estimated to have risen further since then.
One solution to this predicament would be for small companies in the same
industry to merge (already happening in the textiles and furniture
industries), or to be taken over by a larger company.
Merging would narrow the large gap in Italian industry between the tens of
thousands of small businesses and the handful of very large companies - and
facilitate long-term borrowing from banks to buy necessary new technology.
Financing has always been problematic for small businesses in Italy because,
unlike their counterparts in Anglo-Saxon economies, they have been unable to
tap the stock market or other financial markets. Neither can they get banks
to inject capital, which happens often in Germany, because in Italy banks
are not allowed to take stakes in companies. Furthermore, they have to
compete with the state for private savings.
So small businesses rely heavily on short-term financing, either in the form
of trade credits or bank loans, though some small business owners have
clubbed together in so-called mutual guarantee schemes, to get more
attractive loans from the banks.
Confapi is concerned about the high proportion of short-term financing among
its members - estimated at 70 per cent - and has asked the government for
funds of L7,000bn (Pounds 3.3bn) to help small businesses convert them into
longer-term loans.
Some economists believe that the 'small is beautiful' concept may have run
its course in Italy, and that the small companies which survive the current
difficulties will be those which have made the necessary technological leap,
or those least dependent on big companies. They fear that others, especially
those in troubled industries, will either have to merge, sell out, or close
down.
But it would be foolish to underestimate the resilience of Italy's
entrepreneurial class, which has triumphed over economic adversity in the
past. Italy's 'piccoli forti' could well live to fight another day.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (8): Intelligence opens the door
 -Turin Polytechnic pioneered research links with industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONCEPT of linking universities and polytechnics with industry, both to
raise funds and to cross-fertilise R &amp; D, has been little developed in
Italy.
University statutes have been structured so that they are centrally
controlled from Rome - and dependent upon the government for funding. Thus
there has been little incentive for them to seek external funding or offer
their skills and facilities to industry.
This position has been reinforced by the limited number of industrial
concerns of sufficient size and technological advancement to consider
collaboration. Within this broad overall picture, Turin Polytechnic has
proved a notable exception.
It has taken advantage of its location to pioneer research links with
industry. Turin, the company town of Fiat, has been the centre of the
Italian automotive industry while also hosting an important range of
engineering establishments in the surrounding Piedmont. This has proved a
fertile catchment area for contract work now both national and international
in its scope.
'Today we obtain about 7 per cent of our total funding from outside
contractual work,' says Professor Rudolfo Zich, the rector. These contracts
now cover 40 per cent of the polytechnic's annual research budget; they will
be worth L9bn this year.
The activity, first developed in the early post-war years, has been helped
by the polytechnic's status: it specialises in engineering, physics and
mathematics, together with separate faculty of architecture. Contractual
work was a logical extension of its prime function - supplying graduate
engineers to north Italian industry. But it was not until the early 1980s
that changes in the laws regarding universities permitted a leap in outside
contract work with industry.
It was novel to permit university staff, paid from central government funds,
to earn up to 30 per cent more of their basic salary through outside work.
This also coincided with the expansion of the number of fields under study;
electronic engineering and information technology in particular. Turin
Polytechnic now has 15 departments under the umbrella of its engineering
faculty.
'Our aim in seeking contract work has never been to substitute state
funding,' says Prof Zich. Public funding is still seen as necessary to
guarantee the institution's primary function of teaching and pure research.
'Rather we see it as an intelligent way of opening up the university, acting
as a form of self-analysis of our ability to carry out applied research. It
also helps to get the student involved in the outside work,' he adds.
Outside work with industry takes five forms: consultancy; teaching and
information; the sale of information on research already carried out; help
in testing; contributions to research. In this way the institutions aims to
make maximum use of its own laboratories and facilities while also doing the
same with those made available by companies and other research institutes.
The real limit on outside work is the size of staff, which is controlled
largely by the the ministries in Rome.
By the end of the 1980s, 55 per cent - some 180 projects - consisted of
consultancy; 38 per cent of research (127 projects). As a basic guideline,
requests for outside work are weighed by a committee on the basis of quality
and the length of research, with the emphasis on long-term projects begun at
a 'pre-competitive stage.' But Turin is careful to ensure an equal share in
intellectual property rights and patents.
The maximum annual value of an individual contract is about L400m, with a
minimum of about L10m. The polytechnic has had various contracts with Fiat,
and in 1988 signed an agreement which enables recent graduates taken on by
Fiat's research centre(CRF) to carry out joint research.
The polytechnic denies, however, that it depends on this home-town
industrial giant. Other local industries such as the state controlled Alenia
aerospace group provide considerable work in radar, composite materials and
wind tunnel projects; while one of its most profitable ventures has been in
telecommunications, developing the Topsim software system and winning work
from France's Alcatel.
The polytechnic's expertise in radar also led to its most unusual contract:
working for a group of families acting together as the civil party
investigating the causes of the crash, in 1980, of an Italian civil airliner
off the island of Ustica.
The report just completed by the polytechnic's team has thrown new and
dramatic light on the crash. It proves, from analysis of radar transcripts,
that an aircraft, almost certainly military, was 'hiding'' under the civil
airliner just before the crash, and another was also in the vicinity. Their
work on the Ustica case looks likely to clarify one of the most mysterious
civil airliner crashes in post-second world war history.
Local groups still account for 51 per cent of all contracts, but other
regions now generate 38 per cent of work undertaken, with 10 per cent coming
from the EC. And more than threequarters of all this is directly for
industry, as opposed to other research institutes. Significantly, private
sector industry predominates, generating 42 per cent of the work.
Consultancy tends to be with smaller companies; R &amp; D with the larger ones.
As part of involvement with industry, in 1987 the polytechnic formed a
consortium for research and higher education (COREP) as a venture with Turin
municipality, the Piedmont regional council, the local industrialists'
union, Fiat, IRI (the state holding company), Digital and Olivetti.
On the one hand COREP offers short courses in informatics and
robotics/automation to employees in local industry; it has also set up a
laboratory for micro-electronics and optics. COREP has suffered from lack of
the anticipated funding, and at present is marking time. in

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (2): A godfather retires - Robert
Graham examines the role of the Italian state in industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLE of the Italian state in industry is undergoing its first real
structural change since the Mussolini era.
In the past three months the Amato government has initiated a seemingly
irreversible movement away from the state's traditional role as owner,
promoter and financial godfather to industry. The state is set to become
less interventionist and companies more tightly managed according to market
criteria, while a greater share of activity will be hived off to the private
sector.
Speed of change will depend on the stability of the government, the
opposition of powerful lobbies, the attitude of the trades unions, access to
funds and government ability to prepare a privatisation programme that
convinces investors.
At present the state accounts for 15 per cent of non-agricultural
employment, 20 per cent of added value and 25 per cent of fixed investment.
The political parties are almost unanimous in accepting the need to slim
down this presence, albeit for differing reasons. But the scale on which
this should be carried out, and the methods employed, are far from agreed.
The Amato government is oscillating between two contrasting 'conceptual'
positions over the new role of the state. One group within the government,
backed by many managers among existing state companies, favours developing
links between the public and private sectors along the lines of French and
German models.
They argue that the state should earmark strategic sectors which require
large capital outlays and long lead-times on investment returns, and then
create mixed state/private sector groups linked to mixed or even solely
state financial institutions.
They see this as the sole means of ensuring that Italian industry maintains
(or obtains) a share of the markets in new areas of high technology,
especially information technology. This approach also tackles one of the
fundamental long-term weaknesses of Italian industry  - the existence of a
few very large private groups such as Fiat, Pirelli, Montedison-Ferruzzi and
Olivetti, and a plethora of small companies, with little between of
medium-size.
A second approach argues that 'internationalisation' of the Italian economy
has eroded the need for the state to ear-mark 'strategic sectors.' Steel,
chemicals, aluminium and ship-building, for instance, were promoted on
protectionist principles of assuring domestic supply. With the lower tariffs
and greater international competition, these principles went out of date.
Furthermore, with pressure on costs the portfolios of IRI, the state main
holding company, or ENI, the state oil concern, can scarcely be considered
wholly strategic - or, indeed, logical. They have become over-loaded, with
loss-making companies taken on for political and social reasons.
The parlous state of public finances also means that funds for state
industries can only come from the market. And even if the government were
minded to provide subsidies, this runs against the increasing vigilance of
Brussels, which penalises unfair competition. For instance, Finmeccanica,
the engineering subsidiary of IRI, had to pay back - on Brussels' orders -
the subsidy received to cover the losses of Alfa Romeo prior to its sale to
Fiat in 1986. Italian state aid to industry during the 1980s was running
twice as high as that of France, nearly three times that of Germany.
Thus, instead of turning to the state for financial assistance, the second
school of thought argues that the government's role confine itself to fiscal
incentives and generating the right kind of climate to encourage foreign and
domestic private investment to stimulate new industries.
This would also entail new stimuli for the creation of medium-sized
companies, in particular providing tax incentives for smaller companies to
merge without being penalised by added value tax on revalued assets. A
powerful reason for the prevalence of the small family company is precisely
the lack of incentive to be more visible to the taxman.
Without new medium-sized players, privatisation of industry merely risks
exchanging state ownership for control by the big names in the private
sector - perhaps creating new de facto monopolies in the process. Professor
Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, is opposed to such an outcome. But
equally, no member of the government has come forward with concrete ideas
about how a slimmed-down state sector might tackle the problems of providing
Italian industry with the right mix of technology and economies of scale to
compete internationally.
Emotionally the government favours the idea of a slimmed-down but strong
state presence acting in concert with private capital, especially in sectors
of advanced technology, which require long lead times on investment returns
and entail risk. A group like ENI, which in 30 years has become one of the
most important forces in the international oil business, grew up as a clear
projection of the Italian's state need to assure foreign energy supplies
without being dependent upon the old cartel operated by the 'Seven Sisters'
 -the seven biggest multi-national oil companies.
One important factor influencing the outcome will be the future status of
the state-controlled banks and financial institutions which still account
for two thirds of activity in the banking system. For instance, should the
Treasury's BNL or IRI's Comit be restructured in a formal financial/banking
alliance with Finmeccanica, which has become the state's arm in several
advanced technology sectors? ( Finmeccanica has 45 per cent of SGS
Thomson,one of the cornerstones of French plans for 'poles' of advanced
technology and industrial production.)
The government now seems willing to accept the concept of surrendering 51
per cent control of most - if not all - companies. But this still begs the
question of the future shape of state-owned stakes. Can the state retain
control through a British style system of a golden share, or should there be
a clear minority stake ?
Privatisation and the consequent reduction in the state presence is seen by
the international community as an essential means of gaining credibility.
Thus on July 11, in one of its first acts, the Amato government decided to
convert into joint stock companies IRI, ENI (the state oil concern), ENEL
(the electricity authority), and INA (the insurance institute).
The original idea was to group them into one or two 'super-holdings' along
with the Treasury's own banks and financial institutions. The super-holdings
were to have 'clean assets' of L60,000bn, against which bonds were to be
issued as a preliminary to subsequent privatisation.
But this plan was dropped. It was too complex. It created an additional
administrative structure which raised legal problems with foreign creditors
over some L80,000bn worth of debts in these entities. Instead, these four
entities became joint stock companies on August 7, with slimmed down
three-man boards and the Treasury as sole shareholder, as a preliminary to
restructuring their holdings.
The main immediate effect has been to remove a string of political
appointees from their boards, although the presidents have been retained for
the time being. The board shake-up, inplying technical management, is a big
break-through.
The government's resolve has also been evident in the decision to place into
voluntary liquidation Efim, the loss-making state industrial holding. Over
the years Efim had accumulated an unplanned mixture of assets, from
aluminium and automotive glass making to aerospace and mass transit systems,
but was weighed down by debts of over L8,500bn. The move underlined the fact
that the government was no longer prepared to keep alive loss-making groups.
The real test for the message from Efim will come in the next two months.

FT  19 OCT 92 / UK Gilts: Surprise rate cut provides boost across yield
curve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILT-edged securities were among the main beneficiaries of the surprise cut
in base rates, announced by the UK government on Friday. The reduction in
base rates from 9 per cent to 8 per cent led to a rise in prices across the
yield curve for most classes of gilts, adding to the momentum that has built
up in the market over the past two weeks.
In that time, the difference between the yields for 10-year gilts and their
equivalent French and German bonds have narrowed considerably, indicating
heightened investor interest in the UK securities.
That perception has followed from a stream of gloomy news about mounting job
losses and stagnant demand and production in the UK, adding to indications
that the recession will last until well into 1993.
In this environment, the cut in UK interest rates added to demand for gilts
at the short end of the yield curve. This was on the grounds that further
cuts in borrowing conditions can be expected by the end of the year to get
the flat economy moving again.
Somewhat more surprising was Friday's half-point increase in prices for
long-dated gilts, especially as the pound wobbled after the base rate cut to
close on Friday night down 1 1/2 pfennigs on the day at just below DM2.45.
The longer-dated instruments were to some degree helped by the extra demand
unleashed for the shorter maturing variety. But they also benefited from
indications that, even with further cuts in credit rates, inflation
pressures will remain weak.
Accordingly, the benchmark 8 3/4 per cent Treasury bond due in 1997 gained
more than 2 points on the week to close on Friday night at nearly 104 for a
yield of 7.76 per cent. This latter figure was about half a percentage point
lower than a week previously.
At the long end of the yield curve, the 9 per cent stock maturing in 2012
saw an increase in price of nearly 1 1/2 points, closing on Friday at nearly
99 1/2 for a reduction in yield on the week of about 20 basis points -
one-fifth of a percentage point.
The yield spreads between UK bonds and other countries' have narrowed
dramatically. Two weeks ago, the difference between the yields on 10-year
gilts and German bunds was 196 basis points while it is now about 140 basis
points. Similarly, the difference for UK and 10-year French bonds has come
down from 76 basis points to 38 basis points. In both cases, the yield gap
is the lowest for several months.
On Friday, the Bank of England issued Pounds 400m of index-linked gilts,
available from today, which are designed to appeal to investors worried
about the onset of inflationary pressures.
These bonds are in three tranches: Pounds 100m of 2 1/2 per cent securities
due 2001; Pounds 150m of 2 per cent bonds maturing 2006; and Pounds 150m of
2 1/2 per cent stock expiring 2016. The bank set the certified price for the
2 1/2 per cent Treasury stock due 2001 at 155 5/8 , the 2 per cent bond due
2006 at 155 1/2 and the 2 1/2 gilt due in 2016 at 129.
However, countering concerns about inflation were government figures last
week showing the underlying increase in average earnings in the year to
August was 5.75 per cent compared with 6 per cent in the year to July, the
lowest rate of increase for 25 years.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Canadian Government Bonds: Rollercoaster ride may turn even
bumpier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA'S bond market is on a wild ride.
Since early September, the yield on the benchmark 10-year government bond
has swung between a 1992 low of 7.07 per cent and a peak of 8.05 per cent.
The gap between three-year US and Canadian issues has seesawed between 107
and 309 basis points. Price changes of a dollar or two a day no longer raise
eyebrows.
The market could become even more volatile over the next few weeks, with
both direction and amplitude depending largely on the outcome of Canada's
constitutional referendum on October 26. Mr Andrew Pyle, an analyst at MMS
International in Toronto, predicts that yields could climb to new 1992 highs
in the next few days as uncertainty about the vote mounts.
A Yes victory next Monday, endorsing the constitutional package known as the
Charlottetown agreement, would almost certainly ignite a massive rally in
Canadian bonds. Although the Charlottetown pact by no means defuses all
Canada's political tensions, its acceptance would be a severe setback to
Quebec separatists, and to the various other regional and special interest
groups campaigning against the agreement.
Judging by opinion polls, the Yes side has made some gains in the past week,
but the No forces remain well ahead in several key provinces, notably Quebec
and British Columbia.
In the event of a No victory, holders of Canadian bonds will find themselves
torn between a bearish political outlook and generally bullish economic
trends.
The separatists are likely to push for an election in Quebec. If they win
that, they have promised another referendum on the specific issue of
independence for the francophone province. At the very least, a No vote next
Monday will keep Canadians pre-occupied with the national unity issue for
years to come.
Even so, bond market optimists argue that a thumbs-down to the Charlottetown
agreement will do no more than delay and stretch out an inevitable
resumption of the two-year slide in interest rates.
Canada's inflation is running at a miniscule annual rate of 1.3 per cent,
the lowest among the leading industrial countries. Nor is it expected to
accelerate much for at least the next 12 months, with real gross domestic
product forecast to rise by no more than about 1.5 per cent this year and
3.5 per cent in 1993.
Foreign investors do face the risk that gains in bond prices could be wiped
out by a further drop in the Canadian dollar, which has slid by more than 10
per cent from its November 1991 peak of 89.30 US cents.
The Bank of Canada has so far been reluctant to allow sudden, big falls in
the currency. Many market players are confident that it will continue to
smoothe the dollar's decline, if necessary by temporarily pushing up
interest rates, as it has during the European currency crisis and the run-up
to the referendum.
On balance, the prevailing view is that, whatever shocks are in store over
the next few weeks, the long-term outlook for bonds remains favourable. Mr
Clive Coombs, who runs a Canadian bond mutual fund for AGF Management of
Toronto, says that 'as long as you can sit tight for the next month, the
fundamentals are tremendous.'
Mr Coombs expects yields to fall by at least 50 to 75 basis points over the
next 12 months. Burns Fry, the Toronto securities firm, concluded in its
weekly fixed-income review last week that 'any price weakness remains a
buying opportunity'.
Investors took that advice after Standard &amp; Poor's cut its rating on
Canada's foreign-currency debt last week from Triple A to Double A-Plus.
Bond prices tumbled by as much as CDollars 2 immediately after the
announcement, but they had recovered the loss by last Friday.

FT  19 OCT 92 / US Money and Credit: Markets take the tug-of-war strain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TUG-of-war between economic realities and political uncertainty is likely
to dominate the US credit markets over the next few weeks as Wall Street
nervously adjusts to the probability of a Democratic victory in the
presidential election.
The elements of the tussle were neatly encapsulated in trading on Friday,
when the government reported yet more grim economic news, which would
normally be expected to give the credit markets a fillip.
The trade deficit widened sharply in August, to Dollars 9bn, due to the
largest drop in exports in five years. A separate report showed industrial
output in the US fell two-tenths of 1 per cent in September, the third drop
in the last four months.
Coming on top of figures showing extremely weak - and consumer
confidence-eroding - declining average weekly earnings, and poor early
October car sales, Friday's statistics presented a picture of an economy
growing very weakly.
Yet the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue fell  3/16 on Friday,
with the yield rising to 7.52, up from 7.5 per cent on Thursday and
virtu-ally unchanged on the week.
The reason for the yield upturn was a remark by Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate. He said he was examining new ways to
'bump this economy', and if elected might try to speed federal spending.
There was not that much new about the remark. Mr Clinton has said many times
that his priority on taking office would be to introduce a jobs programme.
Democrats , are said to be preparing for a legislative blitz in Mr Clinton's
first 100 days of office.
The trouble for the credit markets is that little is known of Mr Clinton's
precise plans, and Wall Street fears that a package of sharp fiscal stimuli
will greatly increase the size of the budget deficit, and thus the
government's borrowing requirement, while also reigniting inflation. Both
would be bad for bond prices.
The market will, therefore, be prone to attacks of nervousness at every
fiscal package rumour up to election day, on November 3 - and well beyond if
Mr Clinton wins.
However, a Democratic victory might not prove quite so bad for the money
markets as Wall Street fears. First, a stimulus from a Clinton
administration would be constrained by the sheer size of the existing budget
deficit. Second, a re-elected President Bush would almost certainly have to
introduce an economic stimulus of his own.
Third, however rapidly legislation was prepared, it would take many months
for the impact to feed through into economic activity. And finally, the
economy is so enfeebled, and price rises are so restrained, that the
inflationary genie is not about to jump out of its bottle.
Indeed, many economists still expect a further round of easing by the Fed,
despite repeatedly dashed hopes of a move over the past few weeks. However,
the bank may wait until after November 3, given the market's electoral
jitters.
But if Mr Clinton were to win, a subsequent Fed easing could further widen
the already record yield gap between the short and long ends of the market.
What remains uncertain is just how much Clinton jitters are already factored
in to the long end, where over the past month bond yields have interrupted a
downward trend, jumping sharply upwards from the year's low of 7.2 per cent,
struck in early September.
For example, Mr Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C J Lawrence, expects the
long bond to jump to 8 per cent if Clinton wins. Analysts at Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette are more sanguine, arguing that the back-up in rates will
prove short-lived and that the long bond will reach 6.5 per cent by
mid-1993.

FT  19 OCT 92 / People: Spray flies at North West Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
North West Water, the UK's second largest water company, has lost its group
finance director in the same week that it issued a 'counter-notice' to
Ofwat, challenging the industry regulator's request for limits on price
increases.
However, the company, which refuses to elaborate on the circumstances
surrounding the departure of Steve Mc-Adam last Wednesday after just 10
months at the utility, indicates the two events are not connected. Bob
Ferguson, formerly finance director of the core utility North West Water
Limited, and since the turn of the year its deputy managing director, steps
into McAdam's shoes.
This is yet another change within the industry which has suffered a
surprisingly high degree of turnover on its post privatisation boards,
particularly among finance directors - much more so for instance than have
the regional electricity companies.
North West Water, like many others in its sector, had elected to bring in an
appointee from outside the industry - Mc-Adam had previously been at Hewlett
Packard in the UK, before he joined at the beginning of the year on the
retirement of Archie Ramsay.
'Steve did not fit the team. Obviously the company has decided to go back to
a safe pair of hands. They (the counter-notice and the resignation) just
came to a head in the same week, but they were entirely unrelated' is all
Ferguson is prepared to say.
With the company since 1974, Ferguson, 50, had been perceived by many as
Ramsay's natural successor. But he makes out that he was not disappointed to
miss out on the group finance job last time around. 'I had an extremely
interesting job as deputy managing director,' he contends.
The City has been additionally puzzled that, whereas McAdam initially
devoted a lot of time to investor relations, that role in the last month or
two appeared to have been largely assumed by Alan Dean, group business
development director and an erstwhile Rothschild director. 'Both Alan and I
will play a prominent role in investors relations,' says Ferguson, but he
acknowledges that the division of responsibilities is 'not totally worked
out' yet.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Little more than a year after William Strong arrived in London to head
Salomon Brothers' European investment banking business, his empire has
doubled in size. The 40-year-old Strong, a former co-head of the firm's New
York mergers and acquisitions department, has been put in charge of all
investment banking business outside the US.
It is a newly created job. In the past different regions have reported to
different people and Strong says that the new structure reflects the growing
demand of Salomon's global clients for a single point of contact.
Salomon is still best known for its trading and market-making skills but
Strong's appointment is another sign that the firm is intent on
significantly expanding its international investment banking business which
takes in capital raising, corporate finance, mergers and acquisitions and
advisory work.
Strong, who will continue to be London-based and have a team of around 200
professionals reporting to him, has taken over responsibility for all the
firm's international investment banking functions and offices in Asia,
Australia, and Canada as well as his old business in Europe. New York-based
groups covering Latin America, sovereign governments and development banks
will also report to Strong. He in turn will report to Richard Barrett and
Leo Higdon in New York who run investment banking worldwide.
Strong took charge of Salomon's European investment banking business after
Ron Freeman left to head the merchant banking operation of the newly-created
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Since he arrived in London, Strong has set up a worldwide privatisation
practice, headed by Francis Maude, the former Treasury minister who lost his
seat in the last election, and established a specialist group which advises
on infrastructure projects.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Economics: Retail gloom remains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week will bring disturbing reminders of the difficulties plaguing the
British economy and should provide some explanations for the government's
decision to cut bank base rates by a full percentage point last Friday.
Subdued domestic demand will influence Wednesday's retail sales figures for
September. Although shop sales began quite strongly, analysts report that
discretionary spending fell during the days following Black Wednesday and
expect a small decline in sales volumes compared with August.
UK money supply figures on Tuesday are expected to show that bank and
building society lending was weak last month. Economists expect that
Britain's trade figures on Thursday will continue to show visible and
current account deficits of more than Pounds 1bn in September.
Although sterling's devaluation since September 16 will make exports more
competitive, Britain's heavy dependency on imported goods could result in
bigger visible trade and current account deficits in the months ahead.
Towards the end of the week, the German Bundesbank should produce its M3
money supply statistics for September. These will be inflated by the
large-scale currency inflows during last month's crisis in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Bundesbank watchers will monitor reactions to the figures from central bank
council members to assess whether German interest rate cuts are in the
offing.
Signs are growing of a sharp slowdown in activity in Germany. Some
indication of current inflationary pressures will come in preliminary
cost-of-living data from North Rhine Westphalia and Baden Wurttemberg.
Some of the week's highlights follow. The median of economists' forecasts
from MMS International, a financial information company, are given in
brackets.
Today: United States, final presidential debate in East Lansing, Michigan.
France, August industrial production (up 0.5 per cent on month). Australia,
August export prices. Canada, August wage settlement increases.
Tomorrow: Japan, August leading diffusion index. September M2 plus CD money
supply (down 0.1 per cent). UK, September M0 (up 0.4 per cent on month, 2.2
per cent on year), M4 (up 0.1 per cent on month, 4.8 per cent on year), M4
lending (Pounds 2.4bn). US, September housing starts (1.2m).
Wednesday: France, G7 deputies begin two-day meeting in Paris. UK, September
retail sales (down 0.3 per cent on month, up 0.7 per cent on year), new
August construction orders. Canada, August retail sales (up 0.2 per cent on
month).
Thursday: UK, September visible trade balance (Pounds 1.1bn deficit),
current account (Pounds 1bn deficit), British chambers of commerce quarterly
business survey. US, initial claims for week to October 10 (398,000), money
supply for week to October 12. Canada, August wholesale trade.
Friday: France, September trade balance (FFr1bn surplus). US, auto sales,
October 11 to 20 (6.1m annual rate), third quarter housing vacancies.
During the week: Bank of Japan fourth quarter economic outlook. Italy,
September industrial production (down 1.8 per cent on year), wholesale price
index (up 2.1 per cent on year), balance of payments (L7 trillion), October
City consumer prices (up 5.3 per cent on year). Germany, September M3 from
Q4 base (10.4 per cent), October cost of living in North Rhine Westphalia
and Baden Wurttemberg, September GFK consumer climate survey.

FT  19 OCT 92 / People: From Granada to Meridian
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Malcolm Wall, sales director of Granada Television, has been appointed
deputy chief executive of Meridian Television, the new ITV company for the
south of England.
Wall is also the current chairman of the ITV Association's marketing
committee.
The ITV executive was one of those considered in the running for the chief
executive's job at Granada following the departure of Andrew Quinn to run
the ITV central network.
The job went instead to Charles Allen, a Granada group executive.
Wall, who will work with Meridian's chief executive Roger Laughton, says he
regards his new job as ' a terrific opportunity to get involved in a new
company building a broadcasting business from scratch.'
Meridian goes on the air at the beginning of next year.
The present deputy sales director of Granada, Michael Desmond, has been
promoted to the position of sales director and will join the board of
Granada Television.
Granada says that Desmond's appointment confirms the role he has assumed for
the past 18 months of managing the sales operation. This enabled Wall to
involve himself in general television industry issues, the company adds.

RESULTS DUE
SMITHS Industries is expected to report on Wednesday a 15 per cent drop in
pre-tax profit for the year to July 31 from Pounds 120.3m to about Pounds
102m, because of slowing demand in its key aerospace sector with falling
production rates of F-16 military aircraft and Boeing 737 airliners.
Cash generation is thought to have remained strong and interest income
healthy at about Pounds 14m despite spending on acquisitions, particularly
in its medical sector. An increased dividend of 11.2p (10.7p) is likely.
Earnings are expected to fall to 23p from 27.6p.
Albert Fisher, the fresh produce distributor and food processor, upset its
shareholders in July with a profits warning. The shares dropped 25p on the
day to 41p and have fallen fur ther since it said a glut of produce would
hit profits. Analysts cut their forecast to about Pounds 60m from Pounds 77m
for the year ended August, against Pounds 89m a year earlier.
The company has many fences to mend when it reports on Thursday.
Wolseley, the heating and building supplier, announces final results for the
year to July 31 tomorrow and is expected to reveal pre-tax profits of close
to Pounds 70m, down from Pounds 80.3m a year earlier.
With the UK market flat, analysts will be hoping for signs of upturn from
Wolseley's United States operations.
Results from Brossette, the French supplier acquired earlier this year, will
be included in the second half but any contribution is expected to be small.
Paterson Zochonis, the Cussons soap and toiletries maker and overseas
trader, is likely to report tomorrow full-year pre-tax profits fractionally
ahead from last year's Pounds 25.4m. It will be a creditable performance
considering that one-third of its sales are in Nigeria, which has suffered a
40 per cent devaluation.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Monday Interview: Conjuror in the cabinet - John MacGregor,
UK transport secretary, speaks to Richard Tomkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's transport secretaries rarely stick around for long. You only have
to look at the record: eight have already gone since the Conservatives took
office in 1979, moving on to higher office, oblivion or the House of Lords.
Even so, a more-than-usually noticeable air of impermanence surrounds the
ninth incumbent, John MacGregor. After barely six months at the Department
of Transport, this one-time conjuror, banker and chief secretary to the
Treasury has suddenly, and however improbably, emerged as the current
favourite for the chancellor's job should the beleaguered Norman Lamont go.
Of course, Mr MacGregor is not so lacking in tact as to say he actually
wants to be chancellor. Mr Lamont is doing very well indeed in the post, he
says, and he himself has quite enough to be getting on with at the transport
department even to think about moving just yet.
His words, however, have a hollow ring to them. A rather stronger impression
is that Mr MacGregor is dying to get his hands on the job. During the course
of an hour-long interview, he emphasises his deeply-rooted interest in
economics and enthusiastically sets out his stall on Europe. Somehow,
Transport just doesn't seem to arouse the same fervour.
So who is this would-be chancellor? One of the less charismatic figures in
the cabinet, Mr MacGregor, 55, suffers from a low public profile. His
reputation, too, is that of a consolidator rather than an innovator  -
witness his slowing down the pace of educational reform when education
secretary. On the other hand, he is bright, tough, modest and well-liked,
his pragmatism can be seen as a virtue, and he is one of the Cabinet's most
experienced politicians.
A doctor's son, Mr MacGregor was born in Glasgow and brought up in Shotts, a
Lanarkshire mining village. He was later schooled in Edinburgh, then went to
St Andrews University with the intention of becoming a Scottish advocate.
They were hard times: in his university days, he recalls, he only scraped by
thanks to scholarships, his father, and his income from conjuring.
Conjuring?
'Yes. I can't remember how it started, but the very first public performance
I gave was aged 11 in the miners' welfare hall in Shotts. Then I did quite a
lot at school, and very particularly at university, where I had the
professional name of Del Genie.' His speciality was, and remains,
mind-reading. Even today Mr MacGregor is a member of the Magic Circle,
though his ministerial duties leave him little time to practise his craft.
But he has lost none of his old skills. Challenged to give an impromptu
performance, he fixes his interviewer with a penetrating gaze and says: 'I
think you are probably thinking this is a very strange way to conduct an
interview about British Rail.' Incredibly, he is correct.
Conjuring apart, Mr MacGregor's university days were notable for stimulating
his interest in politics and economics. Quite by chance, he says, he took up
political economy as a secondary subject to law, and became hooked. He
joined the students' Conservative association and later became chairman of
the Federation of University Conservative Unionist Associations.
That marked him out for politics. Completing his law degree at King's
College, London, he became special adviser to the then prime minister, Alec
Douglas-Home, in 1963. Then, with the Conservatives in opposition, he headed
the private office of party leader Edward Heath.
MacGregor has held five cabinet posts since the Conservatives came to power
in 1979. The reason for the speculation over his next job is that, in a
party riven by dissent, he looks less divisive on the critical issues of the
economy and Europe than his cabinet rivals.
Where, then, does Mr MacGregor see himself on the political spectrum? His
two biggest preoccupations, he says, since his university days, have been
Europe and the economy.
On Europe, he proclaims himself a passionate supporter of Britain's
membership of the European Community. This partly reflects his belief in the
Community's original role as a means of securing peace; but beyond that, he
says, Britain's population of 55m is simply not a large enough market to
allow the country's industry and commerce to thrive.
At the same time, however, Mr MacGregor makes the necessary nod to the
Euro-sceptics. 'I feel equally strongly nowadays that the EC has too often
got too far involved in areas which have nothing to do with the development
of the Community, and therefore I have been one of the strongest advocates
of subsidiarity all the way through.'
He regrets Britain's withdrawal from the ERM and believes the country should
rejoin when the conditions are right - though that, he says, is unlikely to
be soon. But he is cautious over economic and monetary union. The conditions
for entry must be acceptable, he says, 'and I have considerable doubts as to
whether we will see Emu as a practical matter this decade, because those
conditions are just not going to apply.'
On economic matters generally, he says he supports 'everything we did'
during the Thatcher years. If that sits oddly with his former position as Mr
Heath's adviser, he says the reason is that Mr Heath had broadly the same
policies as those that came to be known as Thatcherism till he shifted
ground in 1972.
'I am a very strong believer in low direct taxation and encouraging people
with incentives - particularly to save, because I am very pro wider
ownership. I am also very strongly in favour of privatising, very strongly
for private enterprise, very strongly for letting the markets work, very
strongly for small businesses. I think a lot of this comes from my Scottish
Presbyterian background. I have always been very strongly in favour of
giving people the opportunity to be independent.'
Quizzed on his political ambitions, he re-emphasises his strong interest in
economic policy, then reminisces about the years he spent on the opposition
finance team with the likes of Nigel Lawson, Cecil Parkinson, Norman Lamont
and Nicholas Ridley. It is almost as though he is trying to say something;
but suddenly, he says his one regret is that he would have liked to have
stayed longer as education secretary. As it was, he was unable to see his
policies to fruition. 'I don't want that to happen in transport - I have
only been here for a very short time and there are a lot of exciting things
going on.'
Ah yes, transport. We have just turned to the subject when Mr MacGregor cuts
in. He has forgotten to mention the 11 years he spent at Hill Samuel, the
merchant bank - latterly as a director. 'I found that immensely interesting,
and that experience of business has lived with me in politics all the way
through, and I do actually think it's been very significant to me in my
career.'
Firmly back on transport, Mr MacGregor's views seem to be best summed up in
three words: roads, roads, roads.
Ever the pragmatist, Mr MacGregor acknowledges that it would be nice to see
more traffic switch from road to rail, but says it is just not practical.
Some 90 per cent of all traffic goes by road, and as long as people keep
buying more cars and using them, they are going to need more road space.
'I do wish to do what one can for public transport, and we have done quite a
lot, but there is no doubt that we have a need for improved roads. And the
demand for by-passes is very large. I sometimes think that the more extreme
environmental lobbies don't recognise just how strong the pressure is from
the public for by-passes. I have seen the benefits of by-passes in my own
constituency - they are quite enormous.'
Road users may not have things all their own way. Mr MacGregor accepts that
the day may come when charging for road use may become necessary to ease
congestion in urban areas. But that is a long way off: and everything else
he has said tends to confirm the suspicion that, faced with the need for
cuts in the current public spending round, he would not resist the axeing of
London's Jubilee Line extension if the result were to leave his roads
programme intact. If only he were chancellor, the decision would be up to
him.

FT  19 OCT 92 / The fiscal dilemma facing Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Financial markets were awash with speculation last week that a newly elected
President Bill Clinton would order an immediate fiscal stimulus next year to
kick-start a stagnant or declining economy. Campaigning in Virginia, Mr
Clinton reacted cautiously. He said he would review the need for tax cuts or
spending increases, but had not yet made any specific decisions. 'I do think
there are some ways to accelerate economic activity . . . like accelerating
the highway programme. There are ways to do that that wouldn't necessarily
increase the deficit,' he said.
The speculation about a fiscal boost next year reflects growing anxiety that
the US recovery is again losing momentum, despite cuts in interest rates to
the lowest levels in a generation. Many American economists believe a
negative, recession psychology is so deeply entrenched that a direct
injection of purchasing power through higher short-term government borrowing
is now the only way to revive the economy. Signs that Europe and Japan are
either in or on the brink of recession have heightened fears that too much
is being expected of monetary policy. Speaking in Tokyo, Mr Alan Greenspan,
the Federal Reserve chairman, inadvertently fuelled such fears by hinting
that the world could be facing the most intractable downturn in 50 years.
The US outlook has undoubtedly worsened since the summer, which is one
reason why President George Bush appears so listless in debates; as the
depressing figures roll in, his economic record has become all but
impossible to defend. The day after Mr Bush cited exports as a bright spot,
official figures showed the trade deficit surging in August to an
astonishing Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5.29bn). This mostly reflected a slump in
overseas demand for US goods - a worrying sign that the global slowdown is
now inflicting acute pain on US manufacturers, who export up to a quarter of
their output.
At home, industrial production fell in September for the third month in
four, while business inventories rose sharply in the third quarter,
suggesting further output cuts are unavoidable. Car sales, which had
strengthened a bit at the end of September, fell again early this month.
Retail sales were flat in real terms last month, despite an artificial
stimulus as households in Florida and Louisiana replaced goods destroyed by
Hurricane Andrew. And consumer confidence - a guide to future spending
trends - fell again in early October, according to preliminary results from
the University of Michigan survey.
The figures point to another dip like that in the final quarter of last
year, when growth slumped to an annual rate of only 0.6 per cent. The
response last year included a surprise 1 percentage point cut in the
discount rate and a fiscal stimulus. The extension of unemployment benefits
and reduction in tax withholding ordered by the White House in January gave
consumption a significant boost early this year. And the economy perked up
temporarily, growing at an annual rate of almost 3 per cent in the first
quarter.
Is another, larger fiscal stimulus now needed despite the large structural
budget deficit? Mr Paul Krugman, an MIT professor and informal adviser to
the Clinton campaign, favours a stimulus of Dollars 50bn to Dollars 60bn
(about 1 percent of GDP) if the economy is still stagnant in January. Along
with many US academics, he sees no conflict between higher borrowing today
and longer-term action to raise the national savings rate by reducing the
budget deficit.
Some close advisers to Mr Clinton, however, are more cautious. The nature of
this business cycle, says Mr Robert Shapiro, an economist at the Progressive
Policy Institute in Washington, raises 'grave doubts' about the efficacy of
a fiscal stimulus.
I am inclined to share Mr Shapiro's scepticism. After a decade of big
deficits, it is hard to believe that more borrowing can help an economy
already saddled with far too much debt. Why should financial markets believe
that a Clinton administration will ultimately reduce the budget deficit if
its very first action is to raise borrowing significantly? The fact that the
Bush fiscal stimulus earlier this year had only an ephemeral impact on
growth also points to the limitations of fiscal action in the current
climate.
US companies have reduced costs and greatly increased their efficiency. With
low short-term interest rates and a competitive dollar, they ought to be
poised for a strong recovery. The inhibiting factors are a pervasive lack of
confidence at home and growing weakness of overseas markets.
The crucial judgment for the incoming president is how best to revive
business confidence. If confidence returns, everything else will come right.
If, as some fear, the world is really on the edge of a 1930s style slump,
all governments must stand ready to borrow to sustain economic activity. On
any other economic scenario, a credible plan to reduce US federal borrowing,
starting next year rather than in 1995 or 1996, would seem a better bet.
Lower federal borrowing would allow long bond yields to fall sharply,
sparking a strong investment-led recovery.
In the absence of a sudden revival of the economy, the new president will
face a tough decision. Mr Clinton, the front-runner, is showing commendable
caution in refusing to make rash commitments.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Manifesto of despair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To judge by the coverage of the British newspapers over the weekend,
Friday's European summit in Birmingham has already been consigned to the
category of a non-event. Conceived last month as an international
public-relations exercise, to save Mr Major's face from the domestic
consequences of Black Wednesday, it was engulfed before it began by the new
domestic crisis caused by the British government's decision to close 31 coal
mines.
Europe's leaders had answered the call to Birmingham, in the hope that they
could help Mr Major and save the Maastricht treaty. By the time they
arrived, the British government's self-inflicted coal crisis seemed to be
rendering their efforts inadequate, irrelevant and derisory.
Unfortunately, the summit was much worse than a non-event; it looked and
sounded as if the Community was intent on committing collective suicide. The
communique was doubtless intended to inspire confidence in the common
leadership of Europe's governments, but it sounded like a manifesto of
monetarist despair.
The accompanying 'Birmingham declaration' had been long touted in advance by
the Mr Major's government as the reassuring answer to the complaints of the
Euro-sceptics that Maastricht would subject us to a centralised Euro-state.
But the declaration released on Friday evening is about as reassuring as a
leaky balloon.
The Community's dilemma can be simply stated: Europe's governments are
failing to persuade their electorates that the European Community, as it now
functions, is providing answers to their real problems; and nothing that
occurred last Friday will change that situation. In their communique on the
economic situation, the heads of government said they were 'concerned' at
lower growth and increasing unemployment. Mr Major adopted an equally lofty
tone at his concluding press conference, when he said that he 'regretted'
the plight of the miners his government had just decided to put out of work.
But the millions of unemployed, in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, are
unlikely to be impressed by the 12 governments' statement of 'concern', nor
appeased by Mr Major's vacuous expression of 'regret'. On the contrary, they
are only likely to be interested in Euro-babble if they get the impression
that their governments, acting collectively, can do something to halt and
then reverse the apparently ineluctable rise in unemployment.
Is this the impression that they would get from Friday's summit? In a word,
no. On the contrary, all the 12 are able to offer is the same mixture as
before. 'Strong co-ordination at the Community level,' they say, 'will help
to ensure that the economy of each member state is strengthened by the
success of other member states.' The problem is that there has been no
effective co-ordination at the Community level (for example, over the fiscal
imbalance in Germany which is helping to drive the rest of Europe to
perdition); and it is not at all clear what particular 'success' they have
in mind.
The British and other European governments have tried to cover their policy
nakedness, by laying the blame for Europe's troubles on over-centralism in
Brussels. They would have us believe that we would all be better off if the
Commission stopped interfering in every 'nook and cranny'. Hence last week's
declaration on 'subsidiarity'.
There are just two problems with this subsidiarity issue: it is an off-shore
principle which the UK government does not wish to apply in Britain; and in
any case it is entirely irrelevant to the central concerns of the people of
Europe.
'We reaffirm that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to the
citizen,' says the declaration. But it goes on: 'It is for each member state
to decide how its powers should be exercised domestically.' In other words,
Britain will continue to be governed by an elective dictatorship, as
exemplified by the secretive cabinet decision on the pit closures.
Mr Major is not really interested in subsidiarity; he is merely lancing at
the windmill of a non-existent European state, in the hope that this will
make him look like the champion of the national interest.
In any case the subsidiarity issue is just a distraction. Does anybody
seriously imagine that 49 per cent of the French voted No mainly because
they were worried by 'nooks and crannies'? Of course, the
hunting-and-shooting extremists object to Community protection of migrant
birds. But the main factor behind the No vote was obviously general economic
fear.
Here is the nub. The problem is not really future fear of the Maastricht
treaty, but present fear of the effects of the single European market, which
is relentlessly compressing prices, costs, incomes and growth. The corollary
of the new world of cost deflation is that it is putting in jeopardy the
European model of society. In Britain this is called the welfare state; on
the Continent it is called Christian or social democracy; all these variants
are threatened by European and worldwide hyper-competition, because Europe
is under increasing pressure to cut out all forms of economic activity which
are not immediately profitable.
There is of course no magic solution; there are no national solutions,
certainly not for Britain. But unless the 12 come up with some policies
which seem likely to salvage both the prospects for economic growth and
their traditional national models of society, the single market, the
Maastricht treaty and even the Community itself could founder with all
hands. And that would be a paradoxical and posthumous victory for
Thatcherism.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Sterling on trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALL EYES will be on sterling this morning to see whether the resilience
displayed on Friday, in the face of a one point cut in base rates, can be
sustained, writes Emma Tucker.
Most are expecting the currency to fall further over the week as the market
takes stock of the poor economic outlook in Britain together with base rates
now 1 1/2 points below Germany's Lombard rate.
'The cut signalled a recognition by the government of the seriousness of the
economic situation, but we still need further cuts,' said Mr David Coleman,
treasury adviser at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce.
The market is fairly convinced that more reductions are ahead and the
sterling futures market is discounting base rates of 7 per cent by the end
of year. However, it is still not clear how much importance the government
is attaching to the exchange rate.
Many are forecasting another cut around the time of the Autumn statement,
but Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Montagu thinks
rates have fallen as far as they are going to this year.
'Unless the government can surprise the market by seriously undercutting
spending plans in the Autumn Statement, I doubt they will be able to cut
rates again with a weak exchange rate,' he said.
The dollar, which shrugged off Friday's poor trade figures, may come under
further pressure this week as the presidential election campaign enters its
last stretch. A Governor Clinton victory has mixed implications for the
dollar.
Higher government spending could upset the dollar, but more robust economic
growth might mean the Federal Reserve delays another rate cut.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (9): Tough
times for advisers - Too many investment banks are chasing too little
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMES ARE tough for the international investment banks which act as advisers
in cross-border mergers and acquisitions. There are simply too many banks
chasing too little business.
The volume of international M&amp;A business has fallen steadily since the late
1980s, putting pressure on the advisers to search for new business areas,
cut their costs, compete more fiercely on fees and - in some cases - take on
smaller deals.
With the recession in the UK and the US, fewer companies have the financial
clout to launch large aggressive takeovers of the kind seen in the 1980s.
'The level of activity generally is still much lower than before the Gulf
crisis and the current recession', says KPMG, the accountancy and consulting
group which compiles M&amp;A data. The quarterly average value of cross-border
transactions in the first half of 1992 was Dollars 17.9bn, compared with
Dollars 29.5bn in 1990 and Dollars 32.6bn in 1989.
Not everyone is complaining. Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB), one of the
top-ranking investment banks in the M&amp;A league tables, claims that activity
 -as measured by the number of transactions and the overall volume - in the
first nine months of this year is 'substantially higher' than a year ago.
Other houses are not so cheerful. 'We are having to fight more aggressively
for business because clients are ever more attuned to the possibility of
using different advisers, and so they play the investment banks off against
each other,' says the head of one large UK investment bank.
'Because of the business slowdown in traditional areas such as the US and
UK, there are a lot of idle banks trying to get market share,' says Mr
Francois von Hurter, executive director at CSFB.
Investment banks have responded to the tougher climate in various ways. The
most common has been to concentrate on new business areas where they can act
as advisers.
Much of the present cross-border M&amp;A business is focused on Europe as US and
European companies are eager to strengthen their operations within the EC in
preparation for the single market.
Mr Bill Strong, who heads the European investment banking business at
Salomon Brothers in London, says that many investment banks are
concentrating on areas of core expertise. 'In Europe you will see a
continued trend towards bank mergers and insurance mergers,' he says, as
companies attempt to cut their overhead expenses, achieve economies of scale
and sell their products using other companies' distribution systems.
Investment bankers see plenty of scope for advising many of Europe's big
companies on the restructuring of their businesses. For example, CSFB was
appointed by the Swedish government to advise on the restructuring of two
Swedish commercial banks - Nordbanken, which is state-owned, and Gota Bank,
which had to fall on government promises to meet all of its obligations.
Both of the banks have been hit by heavy credit losses.
In the case of Nordbanken, CSFB is looking at ways of restructuring the bank
so that the government can eventually sell it. 'With bank restructurings you
end up with a sanitised bank which you can then sell,' says Mr von Hurter of
CSFB.
In addition, privatisations are expected to continue to provide a source of
business for the investment banks. One of the important areas is the telecom
sector, where governments sometimes want an injection of capital and a
partner who can provide technological know-how and management expertise. The
telecom companies in Mexico and New Zealand followed this route, and
investment bankers expect further deals of this kind. 'Often the government
is considering selling a minority stake, so there is an element of M&amp;A to
it,' says Mr Strong.
Much of the privatisation business is coming from eastern Europe. The
advisory fees paid in such deals are fairly close to the level seen for
western companies, advisers claim, although the deals often take longer to
complete.
Mr Strong of Salomon Brothers also expects to see investment banks
increasingly being hired to advise governments on the financing of large
infrastructure projects such as the construction of airports or rail links,
particularly where these are partly owned and managed by companies in the
private sector.
While some investment banks privately claim that their rivals may be
overstaffed and overdue for staff cutbacks, few will admit to taking such
steps themselves. 'I think there is going to be a further fall-out in terms
of head-counts' says Mr Strong of the investment banking M&amp;A sector as a
whole.
Another top banker says: 'There are too many banks chasing too little
business - the ones who are good at it can find the work while the ones who
are not well positioned will have to cut staff levels.'
Some banks claim to have upgraded their M&amp;A staff while keeping the overall
headcount steady. Others say they have been steadily building up their
presence in Europe. Mr Richard Agutter, KPMG's head of M&amp;A, stresses that it
is important to get a cultural knowledge of the various countries, given
that 'Europe is not all one culture'. KPMG, which concentrates on advising
the 'middle market' - or deals of between Pounds 10m to Pounds 50m - has
been expanding its network across Europe over the last four years. CSFB,
which also views Europe as a very important source of business, has opened
offices in Budapest and Prague.
Where the investment banks do sometimes admit to seeing tough competition is
on fees. Advisory fees are seldom disclosed in Europe - in contrast to the
US where disclosure is required. But advisers admit that the days of making
fat fees are over.
'The days of making a big killing ended with the 1980s,' says Mr Agutter. In
addition, some advisers are having to take on smaller deals than before in
order to pick up enough business, although banks cannot charge the same fees
for smaller deals.
While investment bankers are hoping that activity will start to pick up in
1993, few believe that there will be a sudden, highly visible, recovery.
Price-earnings ratios are generally seen as too high to encourage M&amp;A
activity, and it may be some time before corporate profitability picks up
enough to tempt the acquisitive.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (2): West
is still cautious - Prospects in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of Europe's east-west barriers opened up a vast new area to
companies looking for new markets and acquisitions to speed their entry into
them. From the Elbe to the Pacific Ocean the demise of communism sent
western companies scurrying to take advantage of new low-cost production
areas close to rich European Community markets.
With a few exceptions, however, such as the US General Electric
corporation's pioneering takeover over the Hungarian Tungsram lighting
company, or Volkswagen's stage- by-stage purchase of a controlling 70 per
cent stake in Skoda Automobila, the Czech car company, the amount of equity
investment involved has been small by western standards.
The initial target areas have been cars, trucks, household appliances,
tobacco, pulp and paper, glass, cement, breweries, furniture, food,
pharmaceuticals and other consumer goods. The best prices have been obtained
where foreign consultants and merchant bankers have been able to attract
several potential buyers prepared to bid against each other. The lowest
prices have been realised where potential buyers were few, where
modernisation or environmental reclamation costs were high or where building
a new plant on a greenfield site was a credible alternative.
The spreading recession in most western markets and greater awareness of the
cost and previously unexpected difficulties associated with buying assets in
former communist countries, has also led to greater caution and
unwillingness to pay high prices for assets which are often technologically
obsolescent or burdened with severe ecological problems.
Experience has also shown that assets left too long in the hands of their
former communist managers before sale deteriorate alarmingly in net value.
This is due to asset disposals and accumulating debts with other enterprises
racked up by managers facing eventual privatisation but having to survive
somehow in the meantime.
But this has not deterred consumer companies looking for established brands
to build on or supplant with their own, or strategic investors in sectors
like power engineering, where the Swiss-Swedish Asea Brown Boveri moved in
early and fast to Poland and Hungary, and big potential growth areas such as
telecommunications.
Initially, most investment commitments by western companies, including new
greenfield projects, have been modest. Prudent caution in what was
practically unknown territory only three years ago has been reinforced by
the positive experience of companies which have obtained large productivity
gains with little initial investment. Electrolux of Sweden and the ABB group
are among several multi-nationals which reaped big productivity gains
through injections of managerial know-how, low-cost organisational changes,
and the slimming down of bloated labour forces.
Thus far western companies, including thousands of small and medium-size
private companies - mainly from Germany, Austria, Italy and France - have
committed less than Dollars 7bn to the region. Hungary has emerged as the
clear favourite of foreign investors, followed by Czechoslovakia and Poland.
Uptil now, few foreign investors have been attracted to Romania, despite its
low foreign debt and 23m-strong potential market. Bulgaria, which has only
just resumed partial interest repayments after declaring a unilateral
moratorium on its Dollars 12bn foreign debt, also suffers from its distance
from European Community markets and the extent of its former dependence on
now collapsed Comecon markets.
After initial euphoria at the prospect of opening up the vast Soviet market,
foreign investors have also taken fright at the scale of the former Soviet
Union's problems and the degree of political uncertainty.
The pace of acquisitions has been set largely by the speed and efficiency of
the privatisation procedures in the various countries. For unlike
acquisitions in other parts of the globe the seller in this region is seldom
a private owner. The seller is overwhelmingly the state or a municipality,
either directly or through the various privatisation agencies set up to
provide a legal and institutional structure for foreign acquisitions.
The various privatisation ministries or agencies are also involved in
organising mass privatisation programmes (MPPs). Some potential foreign
investors see the MPPs, especially in Czechoslovakia, as eventually offering
opportunities to make acquisitions cheaply by buying up vouchers from
millions of cash-strapped, unsophisticated first-time investors.
This remains to be seen. But in the meanwhile foreign buyers have built up a
precious data bank of experience over the last three years.
According to Mr Andrejs Cakste, the senior vice president in charge of
mergers and acquisitions for Electrolux, the Swedish-based domestic
appliance group, the specific characteristics for acquiring a company in
eastern Europe include a high degree of politics, experience at all levels
and above all the need to pay close attention to ecological and other
problems linked to the specific nature of communist-style economic
management.
In an area where basic concept s such as market clearing prices, discounted
cash flows, income streams, depreciation and even working capital were
largely unknown, it is hardly surprising that one of the first problems
faced by potential foreign buyers was that of grossly inflated estimates of
the real value of the assets on sale.
Three years into the process, however, much has changed. Obtaining the
highest possible price, and being able to fend off accusations of selling
out the 'national silver' to foreigners for a pittance is less of a priority
for the privatisation agencies.
Instead, the emphasis is increasingly on seeking a foreign buyer who will
give the best employment guarantees and, above all, provide the best
assurances of future investment and inputs of managerial skill and new
technology.
Signs of growing national and ethnic intolerance are clouds on the horizon
which could change the political climate for foreign investment and
acquisitions. But the consensus now among policy makers in the region is
that attracting foreign buyers willing to modernise and integrate former
state enterprises into the world economy is the best way to ensure the
irreversibility of the democratic social and political changes since the
collapse of Soviet power.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (3): A
stream of consolidation - Despite the downturn in US deals, there has been
some activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
'FEAST AND famine' well describes the switch from the bid-heady days of the
1980s to the deal-starved climate of the 1990s. For the moment at least -
and despite some optimistic noises by US investment bankers in the early
summer - the dearth of deals continues.
A few statistics tell the story bluntly. Since the start of 1992, only nine
deals involving US targets and topping the Dollars 1bn-mark have been
announced. In the third quarter alone, there were just two - namely the
purchase of Fisher Controls International by Emerson Electric from Monsanto
for Dollars 1.3bn, and Mellon Bank's acquisition of Boston Company from
American Express's Shearson Lehman subsidiary for Dollars 1.45bn.
More broadly, the dollar volume for merger-related activity involving US
targets totalled just Dollars 127.8bn during the first nine months of 1992,
according to Securities Data. This represented an 18 per cent fall from the
already depressed figure seen in the same period of 1991.
The decline in the US market was somewhat more pronounced than elsewhere:
Securities Data calculates that global merger and acquisition activity over
the same period reached 10,600 deals, with a value of Dollars 288.1bn. That
was a 16 per cent decline from the Dollars 341.2bn-worth of the deals
(11,725 separate transactions) seen in the first nine months of 1991.
However, despite these generally depressed levels of merger activity, some
trends have been discernible. The first, and most obvious, is the continued
consolidation in certain specific industrial and commercial sectors.
Perhaps this has been most visible in the commercial banking industry. On
the one hand, many banks are still struggling under the weight of souring
property-related investments and loans, and eager to prune costs via
economies of scale.
On the other, some relatively healthy institutions have taken advantage of
their neighbours' misfortunes and are aggressively expanding. This has led
to the creation of 'super-regional' banks - such as Banc One, the
expansion-minded institution centred in Columbus, Ohio, and North
Carolina-based Nationsbank - and spurred a multitude of deals.
This year alone, for example, Banc One has announced plans to lap up the
likes of First Community Bancorp, in a Dollars 125m stock swap deal, Key
Centurian Bancshares of West Virginia for Dollars 536m, and Valley National
Bank of Arizona for Dollars 1.2bn.
But banking is by no means the only sector where consolidation has prompted
an upturn in M&amp;A business. In the telecommunications field, for example,
there has been a steady stream of tie-ups - thanks to technological and
regulatory changes, and the pressures of international competition.
The biggest deal proposed in the sector this year - in fact, the largest
transaction announced in any sector in 1992 - has been the Dollars 2.85bn
merger between Sprint, the third largest US long-distance telephone company,
and Centel, a large Chicago-based local telephone operator. As Sprint's
chairman was quick to point out, the resulting group would be the only US
operator in all three major telecommunications markets - namely, long
distance, local services and cellular communications.
Foreigners have had a role in this process, too. In some industries,
consolidation is a global phenomenon, rather than a domestic one.
Accordingly, acquisition interest comes outside US shores as well as within
them and - from time to time - raises issues of foreign ownership of key
domestic assets.
The airline sector is a case in point. Recession in the big domestic market,
overcapacity and acute price competition between carriers have combined to
create losses of around Dollars 7bn in the industry since 1990. This, in
turn, has caused US airlines to focus on international expansion, while
European carriers have realised that this is probably the last chance to
grab a toehold the US market - unappealing at present, but hopefully
profitable down the road.
So the deal proposals have flowed. British Airways, for example, wants to
invest Dollars 750m in USAir, the sixth largest US airline; Lufthansa, Air
Canada and Scandinavian Air Systems (SAS) have all shown some interest in
Continental Airlines; KLM wants to merge operationally with Northwest
Airlines.
All this has caused much angst over bilateral aviation arrangements, with
the US airlines generally demanding 'open skies' as a pre-condition to
allowing foreign operators into their home market. Whether the powerful US
'mega-carriers' get their way on this remains to be seen: the degree to
which foreign investment will be permitted in the US airline sector remains
extremely moot.
In general, payment for acquisitions this year has come either from the cash
resources of the purchaser, or via some form of share swap deal. Despite the
relaxation of controls on 'highly leveraged transactions', bank finance and
junk bond financing has played a minor role.
One sizeable deal proved the exception. That was the purchase of American
Re-Insurance Company by a management-led, investor group including New
York's Kolhberg, Kravis, Roberts, from Aetna, the large US composite
insurer. About three-quarters of the Dollars 1.43bn purchase price was
raised through bank finance and the issuance of debt securities.
Finally, if mergers and acquisitions have been on a declining trend, at
least there has been some work in the 'demerger' area. Several large
companies have seen the advantage of 'spinning off' laggardly subsidiaries
to their shareholders as free-standing quoted entities, thus freeing up the
remaining businesses.
These have included Ralston Purina, the St Louis-based consumer products
company, which has announced plans to shed its Continental Baking Company
subsidiary in this manner; Union Carbide, with its industrial gases
operations; and, most recently, Marriott, which plans to separate its
property assets from its more buoyant hotel and lodging management business.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of International Mergers and Acquisitions (1):
Politics and open markets - In the face of recession, activity has held up
relatively well, with the restructuring of European industry and the efforts
of US companies to gain a foothold in the EC the main forces at work behind
cross-border acquisitions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GIVEN the depth of economic despondency on both sides of the Atlantic, the
mergers and acquisitions business is not doing as badly as might be
expected.
It is true, of course, that activity is nothing like as high as during the
takeover binge of the 1980s. Those days are unlikely to return for a
generation, if at all. 'I tell my younger people that, if you're lucky,
you'll get three really good bull markets during your career,' confides the
chairman of one London merchant bank. 'They'll be very lucky indeed to see
another like the one that's just been.'
There is also a lot less debt finance around to back big takeovers. The
greater risk-aversion of banks and the lack of interest among bond market
investors for anything but top-grade deals makes it harder to raise the
money for large acquisitions.
On the other hand, the potential M&amp;A market has grown enormously in scale as
mergers and acquisitions have become more widely accepted as tools of
corporate restructuring. Previously a pastime largely of US and UK
companies, takeovers are fast becoming standard currency in the European
Community, while Japanese resistance to the idea is also eroding.
As a result, international merger and acquisition activity has held up
relatively well in the face of recession in the two biggest domestic
takeover markets, the US and UK. In Europe, the shift is particularly
pronounced. Five years ago, 70 per cent of big takeovers happened in
Britain, with only 30 per cent involving a continental European company.
Those proportions have since reversed.
The restructuring of European industry - and the efforts of US companies in
particular to gain a foothold in the EC - remain the main forces at work
driving cross-border acquisitions. Eastern Europe remains an area of great
potential but little activity so far.
According to Baring Securities, UK and continental European companies were
the targets in around two-thirds of all cross-border M&amp;A transactions by
value in the first half of this year. Back in 1988, North American companies
could claim that distinction, as Europeans invested heavily in the US. The
turnabout has come despite the weakness of the US dollar and the
historically low level of US interest rates, which should in theory make
this a golden age for foreign acquisitions of US companies.
Even in Europe, though, takeover activity is not what it was. With
hindsight, 1990 looks like having been the peak year for European
acquisitions, as single-market fever (and fears that the EC was building a
fortress Europe) reached a high pitch. It was also a time when US and UK
companies still had the cash to make foreign acquisitions, before their
earnings came under severe pressure.
That year, reports Barings, no less than Dollars 68bn was spent on
acquisitions in Europe, compared with Dollars 41bn in 1991 and Dollars 21bn
in the first half of this year.
Despite this slowdown, the EC is likely to remain the most active takeover
market in the foreseeable future. As the target date for the creation of the
internal market draws near, much of the industrial restructuring predicted
at the time that the EC's Single Market Act was passed in 1985 has yet to be
completed.
In the mid-1980s, it was generally thought that cross-border acquisitions
would lead to the advent of a dominant handful of companies in each of the
main industries. With experience, this has proved over-simplistic. A larger
proportion of corporate takeover activity has been directed at domestic
deals, as companies - sometimes with the active backing of their governments
 -have sought first to strengthen themselves against the threat from other
EC states before looking at developing abroad.
An increasing number of these strong domestic groups could now be ready to
form cross-border links. The publishers Reed of the UK and Elsevier of the
Netherlands, for instance, recently agreed a merger which could solve for
both the problem of developing into a broad-based international business.
This could be a timely moment for such friendly mergers, says one leading
M&amp;A adviser in London. With few companies looking for big international
acquisitions, such cosy deals have a better chance of passing unchallenged
by unwanted predators.
In some industries - banking, automobiles and airlines, for instance -
companies have taken only the first tentative steps towards co-operation
beyond their own borders. Typically, these arrangements have taken the form
of joint venture agreements on new projects, or small cross-shareholdings.
The first wave of tentative joint ventures in the banking industry has
brought little result: the next step could be outright merger, as Europe's
banks come under pressure to take a more forthright approach to their
problems.
The likely result is that politics will play a bigger role in the
international takeover market in the years ahead. Few countries mind too
much if their leading biscuit manufacturer is taken over, but they take a
rather dimmer view of the loss of domestic control over a bank or car maker.
A period of covert protectionism could be in store.
The political dimension could also take on greater significance after
Europe's currency market instability of recent months. The UK, for instance,
has been the most open market in Europe for foreign acquisition. Last year,
foreigners spent Dollars 11.6bn buying British companies, compared with the
Dollars 3.3bn that UK companies spent on foreign acquisitions. If the
semblance of political harmony across the continent has been disturbed, will
the UK remain as wide open to foreign takeovers as it has been in the past?
Against this background, the M&amp;A business has itself become an interesting
case study for M&amp;A advisers. It reads like this: a domestic business, once
limited largely to the Anglo-Saxon world, has gone international. This has
left many of the experts in the industry looking too small or domestic,
lacking the capital and the distribution network to capitalise on their
expertise. At the same time, a downturn in the business has intensified the
pressure for consolidation.
The answer, most M&amp;A advisers would agree, is for more mergers or
acquisitions. Yet investment banks generally guard their independence as
jealously as the companies they advise. The path to a super-league of
international M&amp;A advisers is likely to be a tortuous one.
The experience of the UK's investment (or merchant) banks is a case in
point. Five years ago, a handful of powerful houses were riding the crest of
a particularly strong domestic takeover wave. The wave has since passed,
leaving several either washed up on the shore or looking increasingly
adrift.
First to go was Morgan Grenfell, which opted for a takeover by Deutsche Bank
to escape an aggressive approach from the French Suez group. Despite
trepidation inside the bank at the time about the potential culture clash
with Deutsche, Morgan has remained one of the success stories in M&amp;A, adding
an increasing involvement in Germany to its domestic UK base. However, that
does not mean Morgan's future is assured. It has failed to provide Deutsche
with a decent return on its investment so far.
As securities houses which sold themselves to commercial banks have found
out in recent years, bank parents eventually lose patience and move to take
a more direct involvement in their precious offspring.
Others have tried joint ventures of varying types. Kleinwort Benson, for
instance, sold 4.5 per cent of its shares to Banque Nationale de Paris and
has talked about greater co-operation with both BNP and Dresdner.
Barings, on the other hand, took a 40 per cent stake a year ago in Dillon
Read, the US investment bank, in an attempt to do what no UK-based merchant
bank has so far achieved, with the possible exception of Lazard: establish a
strong transatlantic business. In recent weeks Samuel Montagu has taken a
more modest approach to the same problem, concluding an agreement with
PaineWebber to span the Atlantic.
As corporate financiers are the first to admit, joint ventures frequently
fail to achieve their desired results, often representing untidy compromises
when an all-out takeover would work better. It seems a fair bet to assume
that at least some of these relationships will harden into outright mergers
or break up altogether in due course.
Meanwhile, two other UK merchant banks - S G Warburg and Schroder Wagg  -
have pressed ahead with independent strategies and built on their
international reputations, while a third, Lazard Brothers, has succeeded in
strengthening its filial ties with Lazard Freres in Paris and New York.
Yet these houses are competing with a growing band of international M&amp;A
advisers, led by banks such as Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse First Boston,
whose skills and contacts in Europe's M&amp;A business are already
well-developed. Too many domestic brand names, and a growing number of
international ones: the M&amp;A industry could do with a spot of sorting out
itself.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Sweden deal helps to jump-start D-Mark
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN'S DM2.5bn financing last week, the largest Eurobond in the D-Mark
sector to date, is widely seen as a turning point in the market's
development.
Despite the importance of the currency, the D-Mark sector has lagged others
in the Eurobond market, failing to modernise its practices. But volume has
grown steadily this year, boosted by the strength of German markets. Changes
in Bundesbank rules at the beginning of August proved an important step in
bringing the market into line with more liberal market practices.
But last week's Swedish deal has helped jump-start the market by showing it
can attract international institutional investors if high quality, liquid
paper is available. The sector is now expected to take the place of the
virtually defunct Ecu bond market as the leading European currency bond
market.
Sweden's Eurobond was priced using a mechanism known as a fixed-price
reoffer, designed to ensure greater transparency for investors, and was
fixed by consensus between underwriters. This method, used in other large
markets, had not been tried in the D-Mark sector, with its old-fashioned
pricing structure and heavy fees. The Sweden deal was 'the sort of issue and
the sort of mechanism that institutional investors like', said Mr Charlie
Berman, director of capital markets at Salomon Brothers. 'The promise of
price consistency created fresh institutional non-bund interest.'
According to one German banker: 'Sweden caught some investors who normally
abstain due to the sector's lack of liquidity.' Until now, the D-Mark
sector, which has no market-making system unlike other sectors, has offered
poor liquidity, although an increasing number of large, tradeable issues
this year had already started to address that problem.
Some dealers say a system of regulated market-making should be introduced.
The market is benefiting from a coincidence of supply and demand. The
turmoil in currency markets created a massive flow of funds into D-Marks,
perceived as a safe haven. At the same time, European sovereign borrowers
need to replenish falling foreign exchange reserves and repay the Bundesbank
for its foreign exchange intervention. Meanwhile, deepening recession has
caused budget deficits in some countries to balloon, further increasing
funding needs. The UK, Norway, Finland, Belgium, Spain and Italy are all
considering tapping the German market. As well as needing the currency, it
makes sense to borrow in D-Marks while it is strong.
In any case, most other markets are in poor shape and would not readily
absorb large offerings. The UK's offering is likely to prove the most
significant for the market. A DM5bn offering, probably over five years, is
widely expected.
The liquidity provided by such a large issue would boost investor confidence
in the sector. There is also talk that the World Bank will launch a global
offering of D-Mark bonds. However, there are doubts about the market's
ability to sustain interest once this spate of sovereign funding is over.
Already, swap opportunities in the sector have been eroded, so funding costs
are not attractive for borrowers without a need for D-Marks. Consequently,
corporate borrowers are unlikely to flock to the market.
Further, the expansion of the market may have to rely on international
institutional investors. 'The German government and its agencies have a huge
financing requirement which could monopolise domestic investors,' said one
German banker. However, the wave of offerings, expected to continue this
week, may create sufficient momentum, provided the necessary support
structure for the secondary market is put in place.
So far, investor enthusiasm is being more than matched by bankers, for whom
the D-Mark market provides a focus for activity in otherwise depressed
trading conditions. Banks are acting quickly to commit resources to the
sector. The demise of the Ecu bond market, in which many banks had invested
heavily, has left Ecu traders with little to do.
'In our opinion, there is no doubt that resources are being redirected to
the D-Mark in London, as well as in other continental centres,' said Mr Len
Harwood, head of capital markets at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The deployment of traders by international investment banks will provide an
important injection of liquidity. In addition, German banks, faced with
fresh competition, are building their forces in an effort to maintain market
share as the sector opens up.

FT  19 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Time to nationalise private
sector debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS all very well to say that the best time to kick a man is when he is
down; but the mob round Mr John Major is now so dense that it is hardly
worth joining in. It is only a few weeks since President George Bush was
hoping to emulate Mr Major and win an election from behind;now it looks much
likelier that Mr Major will join Mr Bush in retirement.
Time, then, to think about the task which will face his successor. (even if
that successor proves, improbably, to be called John Major). The place to
begin is the latest analysis from the invaluable Professor Tim Congdon*,
which examines the current state of British banks, savings institutions and
insurance companies. In any but these extraordinary times, it would have
been the main talking point in the City in the 10 days since it appeared.
In a few bleak charts, it describes a catastrophe waiting to happen. You
think you know it all already? In a sense, we all do. The banks have too
many bad loans, thebuilding societies too many stretched borrowers, the
insurance companies have been meeting claims out of shareholders' funds; no
surprises there. But the words could describe anything from a nasty head
cold up. It is the numbers which tell the real story, which is no doubt why
we try to ignore them. Here are the Congdon numbers.
First bankruptcies - the inevitable result of squeezing a heavily
over-borrowed economy with record real interest rates. The pain should
convince even Mr Major that his policies are working. Company failures have
risen nearly fivefold since the Conservatives took office in 1979. They have
doubled since Mr Major arrived at the Treasury. Corporate borrowings are
still five times cash holdings (double the normal level), while profits are
falling again. The workout has hardly begun.
Personal bankruptcies have risen fivefold in the Major period. The main
trouble, of course, is in housing. The real cost of mortgages - interest
minus house price deflation - is 14 per cent even after Friday's rate cut.
Small wonder that mortgages in arrears are quickly approaching total
building society capital. This begins to look like a black hole.
The banks look in better shape, at first sight: provisions at the end of
last year only accounted for 35 per cent of capital. But remember that
provisioning is restrained by the need to appear creditworthy, and
write-offs by the necessity to maintain minimum capital ratios; remember,
too, that many industrial companies are now on the debt-watch list, and that
property companies, the most indebted group, are losing money year by year.
Small wonder that balance sheet shrinkage is the rule among banks: it is not
a question of prudence, but survival.
Leaving aside insurance (it should be enough, on a gloomy morning, to remark
that solvency ratios are heading straight through their 1974 trough), this
crisis of the financial intermediaries rules out any domestic recovery for
years, even assuming that it can be contained. Congdon puts the earliest
date at the late 1990s. That could be optimistic. The private sector's
boot-straps are broken.
There is one tried and proved remedy: bank nationalisation. This can be
short-term and highly profitable, like the Federal Reserve takeover of
Continental Illinois; it can be medium-term and costly, like the US savings
and loan bail-out; or it can be long-term, like European bank
nationalisation in the 1930s, which is still not fully unwound. This was
highly effective economically.
The cure is essentially a write-off of past errors by converting private
into public debt, and provides a kind of geared-up reflation, by putting
lending institutions under clean-slate management. There is a theoretical
market alternative: sell our weaker banks to Europe at give-away prices.
However, this would be bad value for Britain, and probably politically
impossible. The sensible answer is nationalisation. It might serve Mr Major
right to survive to be the man to do it.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: The Rake rises from the ashes - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The final revival to join Glyndebourne's autumn tour is John Cox's
celebrated staging of The Rake's Progress, designed by David Hockney.
Revival is a misnomer in this case, for the original sets were nearly all
destroyed in a fire. Their painstaking recreation has been overseen by
Hockney, and the results seem brighter, crisper than ever. The production is
once again a visual triumph, a glorious celebration of a great painter's art
which enhances the work and adds to it further layers of allusion. Hogarth
filtered through Hockney's own graphic techniques, just as Stravinsky's
music distilled his classical models ' to become designer's opera in the
very best sense.
In its dramatic and musical recreation too the evening is immensely
rewarding. Cox's elegant, intelligent production has been revived by Aidan
Lang with care and subtle understanding; its virtues seemed even more
precious after suffering the inanities of the Aix Rake only ten weeks ago.
There is nothing heavy-handed about Cox's approach, no jolts as it pans
between panoramic satire and close-focussed pain; the tours de force of the
brothel and auction scenes owe just as much to the thoughtful direction as
to the virtuoso design.
Ivor Bolton conducts a vivid, scrupulously drilled account; a hint of
rushing in the early numbers was soon controlled, and the rest of the score
moved easily and naturally. There is fine, exuberant chorus work and a cast
without notifiable weaknesses. Anne Dawson's Anne Trulove takes a determined
middle path between resilient independence on the one hand and mawkish
sweetness on the other; her singing is firm-toned and most accurately
placed. Barry Banks's Tom began unprepossessingly but gained steadily in
confidence and the flexibility of his phrasing; the Bedlam scene was
movingly managed.
Steven Page's Nick Shadow is well timed and consistently sinister, a little
too much the pantomime villain momentarily, though judged nicely in the end.
Fiona Kimm's Baba the Turk, adorning Glyndebourne Touring's posters for many
weeks now, is a gem, sung without parody and vividly acted; her farewell
scene with Anne was touching.
The remainder ' John Hall's Trulove, Angela Hickey's Mother Goose, Andrew
Yeats's Sellem ' are also fitted tellingly into the scheme, in which every
element is perfectly weighted and postioned. The whole production is one of
the highpoints of British opera in the last decade and more, and once again
should been seen, savoured and saluted.
The Rake's Progress: Glyndebourne Touring Opera at Sadler's Wells. Further
performances tonight, October 22 and 24, then on tour to Plymouth,

FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Kodaly's Hary Janos' - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although rarely seen outside Hungary, Kodaly's Hary Janos is still a
familiar face in his home country. A traveller to Budapest may come across
the opera at a Sunday matinee in the city's second opera-house, as I did. If
so, he should be prepared for a noisy outing, as the theatre on my visit was
filled with enthusiastic children.
There were not many smiling young faces in the audience at the Royal
Festival Hall on Thursday; nor, sadly, as many faces of any kind as there
should have been. This was a disappointing audience for an imaginative
programme. The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra does not have a record as being
the most adventurous London orchestra. and one imagines it could face a
hefty loss on a concert demanding so large an orchestra, chorus and
soloists.
This was doubly to be regretted, as Kodaly's music was given splendid
advocacy. The orchestral numbers of the score, mostly marches and interludes
of swaggering panache, all Kodaly's own invention, are well-known from the
popular suite. It is less widely recognised that the vocal and choral
numbers, which the composer took from Hungarian folk music, are just as
winning in a different way - magical, comic, sentimental by turn.
This concert gave us over half the score mostly in sequence. In fact,
continuity is not especially important outside the opera-house. The crucial
thing is that the performers should bring to the music the same vivid
colours that light up the stage in Budapest. The RPO had a good line-up with
two Hungarians, Tamara Takacs and the fine baritone Karoly Szilagyi, as the
main soloists and Adam Fischer the dynamic conductor.
The music makes good entertainment in the concert-hall, enough to make one
wonder if the inimitably Hungarian Hary Janos would work here as an opera.
Not at the London Coliseum, as the theatre is too big for the work and its
probable audience. Sadler's Wells would be more the size and then it would
have to be in English - as Janos Hary presumably, if we are to get the
hero's name round the right way.
A novelty of a different kind preceded it. This was Mendelssohn's Violin
Concerto according to the composer's manuscript, already heard in London in
1988, but now with a shorter version of the first cadenza incorporated.
There are few vital differences, but having some extended passages down an
octave does give the concerto a calmer, more lyrical aspect. Luigi Alberto
Bianchi was the soloist.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Crucial times for St Paul's - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An important event happened in the City of London last week. The proposals
for the redevelopment of Paternoster Square, that crucial area around St.
Paul's Cathedral, have received the approval, by 18 votes to one, of the
City of London Planning and Communications Committee.
Later this week the plans go before the City's Court of Common Council,
which is likely to accept the firm recommendations of the officials and the
Planning Committee and give the proposals of the long suffering Paternoster
Consortium its blessing.
We all know what Robert Burns had to say about the best laid plans of mice
and men, and indeed there is one last hurdle to be jumped before this long
saga ends and building can commence. The redevelopment of the whole area
around Paternoster Square comes under the jurisdiction of something called
'Article 14', a device that effectively gives the last word to the Secretary
of State for the Environment, Michael Howard. While the City of London can
make a resolution to grant planning consent it cannot actually give consent.
Only the Minister can give the final go ahead.
There is a perfectly sensible reason for this. It has long been felt by many
people, not least HRH The Prince of Wales, that this important site should
be looked at as a whole. As it is not entirely in one ownership, ensuring
sympathetic approaches is both difficult and important.
The Paternoster Consortium is made up of the British company, Greycoat
Estates; the Japanese group, Mitsubishi Estates; and the American property
company, Park Tower Realty. The Consortium owns 4.2 acres of the 7 acre site
to the north east of St. Paul's, for which it paid Pounds 149m in 1989.
The other major parts of the site are owned by Nuclear Electric, which owns
the hideous tower Sudbury House, to be demolished; and Standard Life, which
owns Juxon House, in front of the cathedral, also to be demolished.' Article
14' is being used to help the minister to ensure that all the owners reach
agreement on the relationships between their sites. The architects for the
replacement building for Sudbury House are Rolfe Judd and Partners and for
Juxon House, William Whitfield.
The Minister is a practical planning man who will see that there is now
almost total unanimity on the future of this crucial site. He will surely
note the sensible words of the City of London planning officer, Mr Peter
Rees, who has said that 'architecture is a matter of taste', but that this
scheme is 'the appropriate one for the site'.
The public like the scheme and have said so at recent public exhibitions.
Patient diplomacy has ensured agreement between the three major land owners.
There is little point in reopening the architectural debate, or a lengthy,
expensive public inquiry which will only succeed in making London look as
though it is the one city in Europe that cannot make up its mind about the
future of its major development sites.
The one tiresome body which is apparently determined to throw its
ineffectual weight about is the powerless but noisy Royal Fine Art
Commission. It is difficult to take its views seriously because they seem to
be based upon architectural prejudice and the festering disappointment of
some members of the Commission not successful in earlier competitive plans
for the same site.
In a deeply subjective letter, of a kind that has become all to familiar
when a traditional style of building is proposed for a prominent site in the
capital, the present chairman of the commission says, 'It believes that a
'classical' scheme like Paternoster Square should be a genuine
re-interpretation of Classicism in terms of our own time, the 1990's.
It is Mr William Whitfield's early design for Juxon House which in the
Commission's view appears to be working towards a more contemporary and
appropriate solution.' Mr Whitfield is, of course, a member of the Royal
Fine Art Commission who has designed some fine buildings, but surely he is
too closely involved in this scheme to be held up as the ideal architect.
The developers naturally hope that the Minister will not be swayed by such a
partial letter that also demands a long winded public inquiry. Mr Howard is
very well equipped to see that what matters for London is not the style of
the architecture, but the importance of making progress on a prominent site
that will not be developed, whatever happens, until almost the end of the
decade.
There is a lot to be said for the agreeableness of the present plans. There
is a lot to be said for the Minister listening to the City of London and the
public and ignoring the pontifications of a partial body, the Royal Fine Art
Commission, that appears to represent the views of a very small rump of
architects. May Paternoster progress - with all speed as an important symbol
of the recovery of the centre of London as a key European city.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Bergonzi's Farewell - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ARTIST alive embodies what is sublime in Italian opera more truly than
the veteran tenor Carlo Bergonzi; but many of us had not realised this until
his farewell recital on Friday at Covent Garden. Listening to him, you are
caught at once by music, words, feeling. The voice is produced with the
ideal blend of tension and relaxation: both exciting and touching.
Everything sounds spontaneous, and yet each phrase is a repository of
stylistic wisdom. In few artists are expression and technique so perfectly
fused. And all is generous, all eloquent. This is aristocratic singing, yet
Bergonzi has no jot of superiority about him. Simply, he sings like a man of
the people who has been ennobled by art.
No one has ever gone to see Bergonzi act. In opera he used to be just as he
still is in recital. He shifts his weight, he adjusts his clothes, he clears
his throat, he stands, he delivers. This is, however, a singer we have
needed to see, so effecting was the presence of the voice. He is always both
public and private; he shows that in singing he communes both with his inner
being and with us.
On Friday, no sooner did he emerge between the great red curtains than a
wall of cheers greeted him. It is 30 years since he made his debut at Covent
Garden, almost 40 since his London debut, and some 45 since his original
stage debut (as a baritone). Since the late 1970s his appearances have been
less regular, and people have tended to speak of his singing in the past
tense.
Ideally accompanied by Vincenzo Scalera, he was in miraculously fresh voice
 -seldom sounding older than 15 or more years ago, though often even wiser.
And, in a thousand ways, he showed how great an artist he has always been.
True, a few notes were under pitch - but not one that was not so musically
sustained that it made its effect.
A rich programme of songs and arias - Verdi, Bellini, Donizetti, Schubert,
Tosti and more - had the full house caught helplessly between laughter and
tears. For all who attended, this was one of the great evenings of our
lives.
A standing ovation hailed his final aria, and won six encores (with further
standing ovations). When he inserted 'the' trill into 'O sole mio,' the
house erupted to hear this gesture to Pavarotti and Co; but even more
marvellous was how Bergonzi led us all back into the song itself, which he
gave with an elegiac grandeur that harks back decades, to such tenors as
Fernando de Lucia.
Whether in the arias from Masnadieri, Lusisa Miller and L'Arlesina, or in
taradiddle like 'Mamma,' he made every word and phrase communicate. When
will we ever hear again Verdian recitative so alert with changing emotion?
His singing exemplifies a whole lexicon of untranslatable Italian terms.
Simply, the recital made us appreciate his art more fully than ever before.

There are several hefty current affairs programmes for those feeling strong
enough. BBC2's Newsnight Special for instance is about Somalia (8.00). The
idea of beautiful models returning to their homelands to be photographed in
immaculate make-up and striking clothes with their less fortunate countrymen
seems questionable, yet we shall no doubt be told it creates invaluable
publicity. On this occasion it is Iman who returns to the country she left
20 years ago.
World In Action (8.30 ITV) considers the way that wealth and privilege
somehow survived in Russia despite 75 years of communism, and Panorama (9.30
BBC1) investigates the smuggling of people from eastern to western Europe
following the fall of the communist regimes.
In the last of C4's series Animal Squad Undercover (9.00) the RSPCA's
special unit is on the trail of a consignment of sheep and pigs, travelling
to Italy.
KYTV, the spoof series about television itself, was not watched by all that
many people when first transmitted, but the episode repeated today (10.00
BBC2) won two prizes at the Montreux festival of light entertainment.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Arts: Pig in a Poke - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Somewhere in hell lurks a circle of theatre critics condemned to summarise
the plots of Georges Feydeau's farces. Feydeau himself improvised, but stuck
to this rule: 'when two of my characters should under no circumstances
encounter one another, I throw them together as quickly as possible.' It
would be hard to miss with this play. The Oxford Stage Company unlooses the
Feydeau madness bykeeping to a tight adaptation byKenneth McLeish,
transplanting the action to Edwardian Camberwell. This results in an evening
of wickedhilarity.
An Argentinean black-pudding dealer called Pennyfeather arrives in London
and is taken for an operatic tenor named Amoroso; his host, Wembley, ties
him into a singing contract.' Amoroso' falls in love with Wembley's wife,
whom he mistakes for the wife of Wembley's friend, Oakleigh. But soon, after
a flurry of crossed notes, both women believe he loves them. A mistaken
anecdote leaves the husbands thinking him impotent. He then falls for
Wembley's already affianced daughter.
The essence of this delightful form makes the plot the action, and changes
it with each line. Well-plotted tragedy starts every scene as close to its
end as possible, but well-plotted farce never finishes anything. Feydeau
adds linguistic twists: 'I'll accompany you' says a pianist to 'Amoroso',
who replies, 'where?'
Feydeau also knew, with Dr Johnson, that men in hope believe
improbabilities. The less like a tenor 'Amoroso' sounds, the more latitude
he gets. An unlikely 'voice cure' which is really a love message seems to
work for a while, but you don't need David Hume to tell you about the
pitfalls of causality.
Mark Dornford-May, the versatile director, maintains surefooted contact with
Feydeau's sheer and vertiginous terrain. Claudia Mayer's conservatory set
allows space enough for confusion. Paul Greenwood and Robin Kermode as
Wembley and Pennyfeather catch the pulse of the plot, quickfire and
quidditative. The women, too, are excellent, with Linda Spurrier and Tessa
Wyatt superb as unacknowledged rivals for Pennyfeather's love.
The play moves at autobahn speed. The best lines fall to the fiance (Grant
Parsons) of Wembley's daughter (Tamsin Olivier). Rejected in love, he turns
to Wembley, 'Then I ask for the hand of your younger daughter' - 'I haven't
got one' - 'I'll wait.'
On tour to: Oxford, Worthing, Cambridge, Poole, Winchester, Bury St Edmunds

FT  19 OCT 92 / Moves to protect futures may prevent a repeat of the past
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE years ago today, on Black Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average
plummeted 508 points as the US stock markets flirted with a complete
meltdown.
In an eerie reprise of that day, two weeks ago the Dow fell 104 points in
the first two hours of trading of a Monday morning. The decline was so rapid
some traders on Wall Street began to talk about a reprise of 1987.
But this time, the markets pulled back from the brink, and the Dow finished
the day 22 points lower. After the dust had settled, a good deal of the
credit for halting the slide was given to 'circuit breakers' that were
introduced to limit volatile prices swings after the 1987 crash.
An examination of that day's trading patterns, however, revealed that the
New York Stock Exchange's main circuit breaker - which curbs computerised
programme trading by limiting use of the NYSE's automated order execution
system whenever the Dow falls by more than 50 points - failed to stem the
decline. The Dow crashed through the 50-point loss mark almost without
pausing.
What saved the day were the circuit breakers protecting the futures markets
in Chicago. Although the first of Chicago's breakers - the rule that stops
futures prices from trading lower for 30 minutes after the key S&amp;P 500 stock
index contract has fallen more than 12-points - did not hold, traders proved
unwilling to push prices so low that they triggered the next breaker, which
comes into operation when the S&amp;P contract drops 20 points.
That morning, futures prices began to recover when the S&amp;P contract was down
19.9 points, a hair's breadth away from setting off the second circuit
breaker. Once futures rallied, the cash markets in New York followed suit,
and the Dow began a slow ascent from its unnerving 104-point loss. The
NYSE's backstop circuit breakers - which halt trading for one hour after a
250-point drop and for another two hours after a 400-point drop - were never
needed.
Although circuit breakers sometimes do their job, they do not offer complete
insurance against a repeat of October 19, 1987. Non-computerised selling
does not stop when the Dow falls 50 points, and there is nothing to prevent
the market from falling further once the one- and two-hour halts are over.
As Mr Laszlo Birinyi, one of Wall Street's best-known market analysts, says
of circuit breakers: 'All they do is slow the selling, not stop it. It's
like telling a drunk driver that he cannot use third gear any more. So he
just uses first and second gear, which makes him no less dangerous.'
Moreover, the measures introduced since 1987 have done nothing about the
potentially harmful link between the cash and futures markets. The latter
has long had the potential to inflict great damage on the equities market.
The 104-point sell-off two weeks ago, which was sparked by 'extraordinary'
selling of futures in Chicago, proved how much damage futures prices can do.
One answer to the problem of having two separate, equally-volatile markets
trading securities which by design are inextricably linked, is to create a
single regulator. Proponents of such a solution have called for the
Securities and Exchange Commission to be given the responsibility for
setting rules in both the cash and the futures markets.
But political turf battles between regulators in Washington DC have put paid
to moves to create a single authority.
Fortunately, the introduction of circuit breakers was not the only thing
about the market that changed after 1987. Some of the trading strategies and
techniques that created so many problems five years ago, such as
computerised programme trading, index arbitrage and portfolio insurance, are
much less influential today.
Programme trading still goes on, but it is not the force it once was. NYSE
figures show that programme trades currently account for between 7 and 8 per
cent of Big Board daily volume, compared with between 10 per cent and 12 per
cent a few years ago.
Portfolio insurance, a strategy designed to hedge portfolios against big
market declines that was widely blamed for much of the 1987 crash, is no
longer widely used. And index arbitrage, another bugbear five years ago, is
now practiced by many fewer trading firms than before, primarily because it
is less profitable. Merrill Lynch, for example, abandoned the strategy in
1989.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Terry Smith to join Collins Stewart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Terry Smith, the analyst embroiled in a legal dispute with UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew over the publication of a book on UK company accounts, is today joining
one of London's youngest stockbroking firms, Collins Stewart.
He will be joined by his longstanding colleague, Mr David Pountney, who
resigned on Friday from his job at P&amp;D as analyst of merchant banks and
financial companies.
Last Thursday, Mr Smith's final appeal against dismissal from his job as
head of UK research at P&amp;D, owned by Union Bank of Switzerland, was turned
down.
'I have now been formally sacked', he said.
Collins Stewart is 51 per cent owned by the merchant bank, Singer &amp;
Friedlander, with the remaining shares held by its four founders, led by Mr
Leigh Collins and Mr Andrew Stewart.
Mr Smith's dispute with P&amp;D reinforced worries that the creation of
integrated financial houses, combining stockbroking and merchant banking,
had threatened analysts' independence.
'I am joining Collins Stewart in part because there should be fewer
conflicts of interest', Mr Smith said. The firm is primarily an agency
stockbroker. Set up on May 1, 1991, it specialises in broking UK equities.
Mr Smith will once again work as an analyst of banks, having been rated the
leading analyst in that sector in polls of investment institutions from 1984
to 1990.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Five years on, the crash still echoes / A look at the
long-term effects of the October 1987 fall in share prices across the world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On October 19, 1987, share prices crashed around the world, leading to fears
of a second great depression. Governments eased monetary policy to prevent
turmoil in the financial markets pushing the real economy into slump - a
policy that contributed, in the UK at least, to rapidly-accelerating
inflation and then, in reaction, to the monetary squeeze that produced the
present recession. As stock markets fell, they were responding in part to
the rise in long-term interest rates earlier in the year. That rise, with
the equity market's uncertainty, ended the 1980s' upward spiral of asset
prices, and caused problems for creatively-financed, acquisitive companies.
Some did not survive the next few years. In the UK, for example, British &amp;
Commonwealth, Polly Peck, Coloroll and Maxwell Communication fell victim as
the new climate revealed weaknesses the 1980s' asset-inflation had
concealed.
The charts show that in real terms the four leading stock markets are no
higher than - and in Japan and the UK, well below - their pre-1987 levels.
The table lists the best and worst performing large shares during the crash
period, and what has happened since. The 'crash change' column shows the
percentage change in a company's shares from the day before the crash to the
market's trough; the second column shows the change in the shares from
before the crash to now.
Comparing the two columns shows the market's nose for winners and losers:
shares which suffered most during the crash have by and large done poorly
since, with a few striking exceptions, such as JP Morgan, Disney, RTZ, and
MAN. Those which fell by least during the crash period have usually
continued to outperform the market.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Economics Notebook: Questions over the transfer of western
skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINCE the fall of the Berlin Wall, the transfer of western expertise has
been seen as vitally important for the creation of democratic, market-based
economies in former communist states.
But in the case of the newly-independent states of the former Soviet Union,
efforts to provide policy advice and economic know-how are running into
trouble.
'Technical assistance' is the catch-all term used to describe the provision
of such advice and expertise by the industrialised nations to countries such
as Russia, the other former communist states and countries in the developing
world. For the former Soviet republics, which are having to build their
market economies and democracies from scratch, it covers a wide spectrum of
activities.
Earlier this year two international conferences - at Washington in January
and Lisbon in May - identified 12 priority areas for technical assistance to
the former Soviet Union. These ranged from support for the creation of
democratic systems to micro-economic goals such as the restructuring of
small and medium-sized enterprises, the development of financial services
and the conversion of defence industries to peaceful uses and social policy
issues such as the provision of adequate health, housing and social
security.
On October 29 and 30, a follow-up conference of ministers and senior
officials from some 70 donor and recipient countries and from interested
international organisations will gather in Tokyo. It is likely to face calls
for a big shake-up in the present system of transferring expertise.
Ahead of the meeting, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development has been assessing the provision of technical assistance and
humanitarian aid to the former USSR and found it wanting. The OECD is in a
unique position to judge because since July 1 it has been operating a
computerised electronic data system, known as the 'register', which enables
it to act as a clearing house of information on technical assistance and
humanitarian aid to the region.
The register contains information on about 750 requests from the republics
for assistance and on 2,600 activities that donors have undertaken or
offered. Although the OECD admits that it is not yet perfect, the register
has exposed gaps in the donors' aid efforts and mis-matches between what the
republics want and what the industrialised countries are prepared to offer.
In the field of humanitarian aid, insufficient help has been given in the
areas of shelter, housing and construction. On the other hand, there have
been cases of duplication in the provision of food and medicine to Russia.
The OECD says there are significant gaps in the provision of technical
assistance to tackle environmental problems. The number of projects aimed at
supporting democratic institutions is also small.
The recipient countries would like more advice on how to run their health
services and how to convert their defence industries to peaceful uses. They
are less interested than the donors in offers of assistance to develop
management skills or comprehensive economic reform plans.
Both recipients and donors seem unhappy about aspects of the delivery of the
assistance. The newly-independent states complain about being overrun by
consultants and self-styled experts in missions that lead to no results.
Western capitals have come to dread the arrival of visitors from the former
Soviet Union who seem more intent on shopping than securing expertise.
Beyond these irritants, there is a bigger question over whether the strategy
for delivering technical assistance is correct. The Washington and Lisbon
conferences adopted a 'horizontal' approach of providing a large amount of
advice and expertise across the former Soviet Union as a whole. It is now
generally recognised that this was a mistake. The break-up of the Soviet
Union into independent republics demands a more country-specific,
case-by-case approach.
There are signs that the Tokyo conference will go down this route. The Group
of Seven nations' economic summit in July agreed that 'country consultative
groups' should be set up for the new states. The idea is that the groups
would bring interested international organisations such as the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund, the OECD, the European Commission and the
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and big donor countries
such as the US, Germany, France and Britain into close relationships with
the individual republics to encourage structural reforms and co-ordinate
technical assistance.
The European Commission, which is the biggest single provider of a technical
assistance to the former Soviet Union, is going down the country-specific
route.
It is opening national co-ordinating units in each of the republics to
review the requests for technical assistance locally before submitting them
to Brussels.
But nobody is pretending that the future will be easy. Plans to create a
technical assistance support group for Russia under the guidance of the
World Bank have run into difficulties.
Although the bank has more experience than other bodies in handling
transfers of expertise, the Russian authorities feel insulted that they will
be overseen by what they perceive as a development aid agency.
According to aid experts, technical assistance is the most staff-intensive
type of aid provision.
Matching supply to demand is extremely difficult and programmes are usually
'underdesigned'.
Past experience in providing technical assistance to other regions is not
encouraging and may explain the rapid onset of disenchantment in the case of
the former Soviet states.
In 1990, a World Bank study found that many years' efforts to transfer
expertise to Africa had been 'highly frustrating' for donors and recipients
alike. The efforts in sub-Saharan Africa were 'not resulting in the expected
improvement of skills and abilities of individuals or in the enhanced
capacity of institutions', it said.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Ford aims to recapture fast-fit business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD expects its dealers to have 100 fast-fit service outlets in the UK by
the end of this year as the start of an effort to recapture business lost to
big independent operators such as Kwik-Fit Euro, Halfords and hundreds of
small garages and traders.
The chain, operating under the name of Rapid Fit, will be established on a
pan-European basis with the UK playing the main pioneering role. Mr Steve
Webb, Rapid Fit's manager, said about 60 outlets had opened and 314 of
Ford's 1,000 UK dealers had so far applied to join the scheme.
The company wants dealers to improve their small share of the fast-fit
market for the 5.8m Ford vehicles up to 10 years old on UK roads. Ford
calculates that this business is worth Pounds 387m annually but that its own
dealer network has only 7 per cent of it.
The two most valuable areas in the fast-fit markets are tyres and exhausts,
which account for Pounds 224m of the total, but Ford dealers have only 2 per
cent and 3 per cent shares respectively.
Without the fleet business and regular service and repair work on newer cars
 -where there is a strong motive to use franchised dealers because of
warranty and related considerations - much of Ford's dealer network might by
now be in substantial financial difficulties because of the drop in sales of
new cars over the past few years.
Ford calculates that after-sales activities on average account for 78 per
cent of dealers' profits - most of it derived from the Pounds 400m to Pounds
500m of after-sales business calculated to lie outside the fast-fit sector.
The problem facing Ford's dealer network is common throughout the industry.
Vauxhall, General Motors' UK subsidiary, and Opel, its German sister
company, have already launched a similar operation, called Masterfit, which
is also being spread throughout Europe.
Both new operations, focusing on quick service and aggressive pricing,
represent a belated response to criticism which grew throughout the 1970s
and 1980s that the franchised trade charged excessive prices and provided
poor levels of service in comparison with specialist fast-fit operators.
The Ford programme has altered in emphasis since it was first conceived in
the late 1980s. It was thought then that the chain would comprise large,
purpose-built sites independent of dealerships and catering for all makes of
cars.
The outlets now being established, however, are on much more modest scale.
They are mostly on dealers' existing premises and the ability to cater for
all makes of cars is no longer being stressed.
As Mr Webb acknowledged, when the dealers' share of work on Ford cars is so
small, it is seen as more relevant to regain the loyalty of owners of Ford
vehicles.
Ford itself has invested Pounds 5m so far in organising the chain and
providing support services to the dealers.
About 200 Ford dealers are now selling tyres, the first stage in becoming a
Rapid Fit outlet. Mr Webb claims that this is already proving a marked
success. Last year dealers had a 2 per cent share of the replacement tyre
market for Ford cars and this is expected to rise to 15 per cent this year.
Apart from tyres, the outlets are involved in replacement exhausts,
batteries and fixed-price servicing - with some outlets also involved in
work on brakes, suspension, clutches and cooling systems.
Ford expects about 100 Rapid Fit dealers to begin operating in France over
the next two years, with a smaller number planned for Spain.
Germany, in spite of being Europe's largest car market, is not included
because, according to Ford, most German motorists have a preference for
using dealers rather than independents.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Companies protest over software bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of the world's leading computer companies has attacked proposed UK
legislation designed to outlaw software theft, saying it is flawed. It has
asked the British government for substantial changes and has also complained
to the European Community authorities.
The group includes International Business Machines, Digital Equipment, and
the Business Software Alliance (BSA), which represents big personal computer
software companies including Microsoft and Lotus, as well as the Federation
Against Software Theft.
They are concerned that a rush to ensure the legislation reaches the statute
books by January 1 next year will result in a flawed law. They believe it
will prove difficult to interpret in the courts and leave the UK out of step
with software protection being enacted throughout Europe. Copying and
counterfeiting of software in the UK is thought to cost the industry more
than Pounds 300m a year.
The draft legislation is a consequence of a 1991 EC directive. The directive
was approved after more than two years of lobbying and debate by computer
industry factions concerned with software protection and with the rights of
software users and suppliers. Observers in Brussels say no other EC
directive has ever generated such heat.
The principal issue was 'reverse engineering' - unravelling a piece of
software to understand its structure so that compatible programs can be
constructed. The BSA said the directive had proved to be a compromise fought
'to the last comma', which gave 'satisfaction and dissatisfaction in equal
measure to all'.
UK legislators have, however, rewritten the directive. The computer
companies have written to the Department of Trade and Industry and to
Brussels to complain that the UK draft 'fails to implement aspects of the
directive, introduces unnecessary and untested language, proposes additional
exceptions to software authors' exclusive rights and omits sections of the
directive which the industry considers essential for a clear understanding
of its scope, intent and effect'.
A government spokesman said the UK draft had been circulated to seek the
views of those likely to be affected, and that modifications might be made
in the light of comments received. A balance had to be struck between
existing copyright law and the new provisions. In Brussels, officials said
the Commission could take action if the UK failed to implement the spirit of
the directive. Privately, they confirmed that the directive had been drafted
so tightly that there was little room to alter the text and retain the sense
of the original.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Reuters boosts Visnews stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS, the news and infor-mation group, is on the verge of taking 100 per
cent control of Visnews, the international television news agency.
The company, which bought NBC's stake in Visnews in July, is now buying the
BBC's residual 11 per cent stake.
The purchase, and Reuters' involvement in last week's offer for Independent
Television News, are signs of the information group's increasing interest in
visual news.
Reuters has taken a strategic decision to add moving pictures to its
text-based services. The group believes it can run the Visnews business more
profitably with full control.
'We think that by locking Visnews into Reuter bureaux we can beat everybody
in international television news,' says Mr Mark Wood, Reuters'
editor-in-chief.
Increasingly, Reuters correspondents are going to find themselves doing
pieces to cameras as well as filing conventional written stories.
'We must have video reporting as part of our normal reporting activities,'
added Mr Wood.
It may not be too long before dealers using Reuters services will not only
have, for example, the words of the Bundesbank president from a press
conference but also live television coverage on the same screen.
The information group also wants to get move financial television but has
not yet clearly identified how that can be done. In the main, Reuters plans
to be a wholesaler rather than retailer of television news - providing news
to broadcasters rather than being the broadcaster itself.
Last week's offer for ITN, which would involve a Pounds 30m cash injection
to deal with a property deficit, would give Reuters a 20 per cent stake.
If Reuters does not become an ITN shareholder, consideration would almost
certainly be given to setting up a rival when this becomes possible in 1995.
A rival service to ITN could draw on the strengths of Visnews and both
London News Network, the seven-day television news service for London, and
Good Morning Television, the new breakfast station.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Radical reform sought for judiciary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUNDAMENTAL reform of the system of appointing and training judges and of
the method of handling complaints against them is proposed today in a report
published by Justice, the all-party independent law reform organisation.
Its central proposal is for a judicial commission to advise the lord
chancellor on judicial appointments. The commission would be chaired by a
lawyer, but would have a majority of lay members with management experience.
It would select judges through a much more open process than now, and job
descriptions would be drawn up setting out the qualities necessary for high
judicial office.
The present system of keeping records of frequently un-solicited comments on
potential judges would be abandoned, although the final decision on
appointments would remain with the lord chancellor.
The report says that any lawyer should be eligible for appointment and that
judges should be chosen for their judicial qualities rather than solely on
their success as advocates. It adds that the retirement age of judges should
come down from 75 to 70 - and eventually to 65 - and that fixed-term and
part-time appointments should be considered.
Justice believes this would lead to the appointment of a broader range of
judges, including more women and members of ethnic minorities. Two of the 83
High Court judges, 22 of the 467 circuit judges and 43 of the 786 recorders
are women. Three circuit judges and seven recorders have ethnic-minority
backgrounds but there is no ethnic-minority judge on the High Court bench.
The report echoes recent calls from Lord Williams QC, chairman of the Bar,
for an independent body to deal with complaints about lazy, rude and
incompetent judges. It says the new commission should take responsibility
for handling complaints and should have power to recommend sanctions to the
lord chancellor. Justice notes, however, that judges in England and Wales
are held in high esteem around the world.
Both Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor - who has won widespread praise for
his recent appointments to high judicial office - and Lord Taylor, the lord
chief justice, oppose changes in the present system.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Thames TV to lose film rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES Television will be told today that it cannot hold on to the weekday
rights to broadcast several hundred films in the London area when it ceases
to be an ITV company at the end of this year.
Thames has asked its successor, Carlton Television, for Pounds 20m for the
rights or threatens to sell them on to Channel 5 Holdings, a company in
which it is the leading shareholder.
Mr Andrew Quinn, chief executive of the ITV Association, has written to
Thames saying that its intention to sell the film rights to Channel 5
amounts to a refusal to sell to Carlton.
Under a 1987 agreement, Mr Quinn says, an ITV company that loses its licence
must offer to sell its rights to the franchise winner. If no agreement can
be reached between the two, the right to broadcast the feature films reverts
to the ITVA.
It is clear that the ITVA is taking control of the rights immediately. It
will, however, grant Thames a sub-licence to use the films until its
franchise runs out at the end of the year. The ITVA says it plans to
sub-licence the rights to Carlton from December 31.
The ITVA will appoint an independent panel of experts to assess the value of
the rights.
Thames is likely to go to court to establish who should control the rights.
The films are important to Thames if the planned Channel 5 goes ahead. Films
will be one of the specialities of the advertising-supported channel, which
could begin broadcasting in London in late 1994.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Feltrim Names face Pounds 6m call to fund legal action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S Names on the loss-making Feltrim syndicates are to be asked to
contribute between Pounds 5m and Pounds 6m to fund legal action aimed at
winning compensation.
Leaders of the Feltrim Names Association met at the weekend after receiving
copies of a damning Lloyd's loss review report on Feltrim last Thursday. The
association will on 12 November discuss its plans for legal action with its
1,500 members.
Some 2,000 Names - the individuals who back underwriting at the insurance
market - face losses of more than Pounds 450m as a result of their
membership of Feltrim syndicates 540/542 and 847 between 1987 and 1990.
Sir Patrick Neill QC, who chaired the loss review committee, said that
Feltrim managers 'did not understand the true nature of the London market
excess-of-loss (LMX) business'.
LMX business is a form of catastrophe reinsurance in which syndicates and
companies reinsure each other's exposure to large losses.
Mr Colin Hook, chairman of the association, said on Friday that information
in the report would assist the legal campaign.
The association, which is represented by solicitors Richards Butler, filed
protective writs against a number of defendants earlier this year.
Meanwhile Names who backed the Gooda Walker syndicates, which sustained
losses of a similar magnitude from LMX business, will discuss their plans
for legal action at a meeting at the end of November.
Solicitors Wilde Sapte, retained by the Gooda Walker Action Group, are
working on a statement of claim.
The Gooda Walker loss review, sent to Names earlier this month, concluded
that weak management and poor underwriting were responsible for the losses
suffered by four Gooda Walker syndicates.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Units chief urges shift from equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE unit trust industry risks being pushed into a marginal role in the UK
savings industry unless it moves away from equity-based products, the
chairman of the industry's trade association has warned.
Mr Barry Bateman, chairman of the Unit Trust Association and chief executive
of Fidelity UK, said: 'I believe our key problem is that the unit trust
industry is equity-dominated. Currently over 96 per cent of our assets are
in equity funds.'
Mr Bateman, speaking at a seminar on the unit trust industry last week,
noted that the bulk of Britain's savings market is concentrated in low-risk
instruments such as deposits or short-term money market instruments.
Sir Leon Brittan, a vice-president of the European Commission and chairman
of its committee on financial inst-itutions, said the EC was considering
several changes to rules on cross-border collective investment schemes to
better enable companies to sell money-market funds Europe-wide.
Europe-wide collective investment schemes, known as UCITS, have been sold
since October 1989 with minimal success. The legislation allows UCITS to be
sold in any EC country without special permission regardless of country of
origin. Because of the terms of the legislation, most have been
equity-based.
Sir Leon said that in some EC countries, unit trusts comprising money-market
instruments had seen very rapid growth, and allowing these to be sold across
national borders would offer greater choice.
He also said the EC was considering allowing UCITS to consist of so-called
'funds of funds', collective instruments whose underlying investments are
shares in other UCITS.
Other changes to the EC's UCITS rules will make it easier for fund managers
to use derivative instruments to reduce risk and allow a fund manager to be
based in a different country from the UCITS' depository.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Retailers' respite expected to be brief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RETAILERS had a brief respite from dismal high-street trading last
month, but the rise in sales was not spread across all sectors and may not
last long.
The CBI's latest monthly survey of distributive trades, which questioned 502
companies, also showed that most sectors are cutting back stocks because of
fears that trading will deteriorate.
September's 'modest' improvement in the high street was driven by sales of
clothing, footwear, furniture and confectionery. However grocers, whose
sales have tended to rise during the recession, saw trading stall at last
year's level for the third month running.
Off-licences, chemists, speciality food and durable household goods suffered
badly. All of the retail trades apart from clothing and confectionery
considered sales poor for the time of year.
Retailers are cutting back on orders placed with suppliers, although at a
slower rate than in recent months, but they still consider stock levels too
high compared with expected sales. Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's
distributive trades panel, said: 'Retailers fear that October will see
September's gains reversed.'
All wholesaling sectors reported higher sales except builders' merchants,
agricultural machinery and electrical installation. Mr Whittaker added that
wholesaling stocks were also 'still too high', despite cuts over the summer.
Wholesalers expect October sales to remain ahead of last year, and will use
that as a chance to reduce stock further.
Motor traders reported that sales of parts and accessories continued to
rise.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Pounds 2bn of tobacco tax 'at risk from EC law'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS MUCH as Pounds 2bn of UK tax revenue could be at risk if the European
Community presses ahead with implementation of the single market while
adopting current proposals for harmonising cigarette taxes, according to the
research group London Economics.
Its privately circulated study - commissioned by the Tobacco Advisory
Council, a lobbying organisation - claims that proposals accepted in
principle by the council of economic and finance ministers 'simply fail to
address the major issues of harmonising tax-induced price differences across
the Community'.
Incentives for 'both legal and illegal cross-border trading' would not be
reduced, the report predicts. 'If frontier controls are removed without a
reduction in tax differentials, then some member states may find their
cigarette tax bases being eroded.'
The Ecofin approach, requiring member states to charge at least 57 per cent
excise duty on the most popular price category of product in their country,
would probably leave UK cigarette prices unchanged.
The study's conclusions point to potential losses for the Treasury of
'anything up to Pounds 1bn' from legal cross-border trade and 'as much
again' from illegal bootlegging. 'Whilst it is very unlikely that excise
receipts will actually be reduced by as much as Pounds 2bn, this figure
provides an indication of the tax revenue at stake.'
The report uses the example of a van carrying 1.5m cigarettes from Portugal
to the UK to show how lucrative cross-border trafficking between countries
with widely diverging prices might be.
Gross profits from such a haul would amount to Pounds 80,000, the study
calculates. Opportunities are significant partly because 'cigarettes are
relatively easy to transport in bulk'.
Tobacco products generate about 27 per cent of overall UK excise duty and 4
per cent of total tax receipts. In 1991-92, this was just under Pounds
6.3bn.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Calvi probe backs murder theory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERTO CALVI, the former chairman of Italy's Banco Ambrosiano who was
found hanging under Blackfriars Bridge in London 10 years ago, could not
have committed suicide but was murdered, according to the latest report on
the circumstances of his death.
Mr Calvi was found hanging from scaffolding at the bridge over the Thmes in
June 1982, days before Italy's then largest private bank collapsed with
Dollars 1.3bn missing. The money had been lent to overseas dummy companies
controlled by the Vatican's bank.
The circumstances surrounding Mr Calvi's death have never been fully
explained. An initial coroner's verdict in London of suicide was later
overturned by a second inquest that produced an open verdict. However, a
civil tribunal in Milan decided in 1989 that Mr Calvi was murdered.
Mr Calvi's widow and son say a private investigation they commissioned has
new evidence showing that he could not have committed suicide.
The suicide theory holds that Mr Calvi approached the bridge's scaffolding
from the river's foreshore. However, the investigation by Kroll Associates,
the international investigations company, has used new techniques in
analysing forensic material to establish that Mr Calvi died 1.at high tide,
when that route would have been impassable.
Mr Calvi's family, which has sent a report of the investigation to Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, hope that the findings will intensify
investigations into his death.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Tory MPs call for higher aid spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITEHALL tension over next year's public spending allocation will deepen
today as 33 Conservative MPs call publicly for the government's overseas aid
budget to be protected from Treasury cuts.
With Cabinet ministers still in dispute over how to curb departmental
spending plans, the MPs have demanded that increases in spending in the UK
must 'not be at the expense of emergency relief or long-term development for
the world's poorest people'.
The 'EDX' cabinet committee on public spending meets again on Wednesday in a
fresh attempt to resolve how to meet the government's planning total of
Pounds 244.5bn for the 1993-94 financial year.
The overseas development budget is tipped for possible cuts while the future
of the Jubilee Line Tube extension to London's Dockland's remains in doubt.
Overseas aid, including help for eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union and
help for developing coutries via the European Community, is expected to top
Pounds 2bn this financial year. An increase to more than Pounds 2.1bn was
pencilled in last autumn for 1993-94.
In an advertisement in today's Times newspaper placed by the World
Development Movement, MPs urge a real-terms increase in the overseas aid
programme countries of 3 per cent over three years. 'This autumn's spending
round will be tight. But many other parts of the world are facing a much
greater human catastrophe - Somalia, Yugoslavia, southern Africa, to name
but a few,' it says.
The advertisement has also been signed by 166 Labour MPs, 15 Liberal
Democrats and seven from other parties.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Personnel chiefs split on ending ageism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should either introduce a voluntary code on the employment of
older people or legislate against age discrimination, according to a survey
of personnel managers published today.
The survey, to be discussed at this month's Institute of Personnel
Management national conference in Harrogate, showed the 1,140 personnel
managers in the survey to be split between voluntary and statutory moves.
Eighty per cent of respondents to the survey, carried out by Professor Peter
Warr of Sheffield University, believed that age discrimination was a
concern. Nearly all agreed that some action should be taken. The IPM and the
Confederation of British Industry both oppose legislation.
Another survey published in the latest issue of PM Plus, the magazine of the
IPM, showed that only 27 per cent of local authorities in England and Wales
had reviewed personnel policies to check for age discrimination.
Eighty per cent of authorities required age to be filled in on the first
page of application forms under the personal details section.
However, only a small proportion had moved the age question to the back-page
monitoring section.
The report said it was clear that the stereotypical views about older
workers remained. 'They are thought to be less productive, harder to train
and more resistant to change,' said the report.
'There are positive assumptions in terms of commitment, conscientiousness
and loyalty. But the negative perceptions tend to outweigh the positive
ones.'

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (4): U-turn seems possible / A
look at the newly nationalised electricity industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Thirty years ago Italy's electricity industry underwent a radical
reorganisation. Nationalisation created a state-owned body charged with
production, transmission and distribution on a nationwide basis.
Ente Nazionale per l'Energia Elettrica (ENEL) was born from the buy-out of
about 1,300 private companies. Now ENEL itself faces the prospect of a
revolution; privatisation seems a real possibility.
The first step towards stock market quotation and privatisation was taken in
July this year, when a government decree transformed ENEL into a joint stock
corporation (societa per azioni: SpA). The share capital of just over
L12,100bn was assigned to the Treasury.
Mr Franco Viezzoli, ENEL's chairman, hopes quotation will be possible next
year. 'But it needs careful thought, planning and execution, otherwise the
operation could boomerang,' he warns. 'At least 51 per cent of the equity
must be sold for privatisation to be a reality. Logic suggests that more
than 51 per cent should be sold, but the decision lies with the Treasury. I
would like to see 28m shareholders - as many as ENEL has customers.'
ENEL will have to overcome a large obstacle in order to be appetising to
investors: low profitability. After years of heavy losses it returned to
break-even in 1985, advancing last year to a net profit of L229bn on net
revenues of L27,222bn and net equity of L15,510bn. In spite of the
improvement, such results are clearly not the kind to stimulate investors'
enthusiasm.
Before his conversion to privatisation, Mr Viezzoli often noted that the
electricity sell-off in Britain was preceded by substantial tariff
increases. But Italy's present climate seems to preclude this option for
ENEL. Mr Viezzoli said, however, that ENEL already has some scope for
declaring higher profits. Last year it booked L1,200bn of accelerated
depreciation in its accounts, from the L5,520bn total charged.
Mr Viezzoli says that the corporation must improve its profit and loss
account in order to offer the Treasury the opportunity of undertaking stock
market quotation in the best possible way. One objective is to reduce
dependence on borrowing. (This rose significantly last year to L32,170bn and
net financial charges also moved sharply upwards to L3,009bn.)
ENEL's chairman believes that cooperating with and encouraging Italy's
independent producers would help the accounts. At present the state
corporation is responsible for just over 80 per cent of total Italian
electricity production; the remainder is produced by local utilities and
industrial autoproducers. There is scope for a greater contribution to
demand coverage from other national producers, and the latest national
energy plan seeks to exploit this. 'If others invest more, ENEL could invest
less,' says Mr Viezzoli.
Last year its investment totalled L9,088bn, compared to L7,979bn in 1990.
When presenting the accounts earlier this year, Mr Viezzoli noted that the
increase in investment in 1991 was the precursor of even greater
expenditure. ENEL's five-year 1992-1996 programme budgets for total
investment of L73,900bn, an annual average of nearly L14,800bn.
Investment on production plant took nearly 45 per cent of last year's total,
a share that rises to 54 per cent in the five-year programme. Part of this
will be spent on making environmental improvements to existing plant.
Overall, ENEL's planned investment on environmental measures absorbs one
sixth of the total.
This may help assuage the fierce opposition that the corporation's plans
have encountered with green groups. Already active, Italy's environmentalist
lobby advanced its cause significantly when it scored an important
anti-nuclear victory in the referendum held in November 1987. Over 80 per
cent of voters rejected nuclear power in Italy in the wake of the Chernobyl
incident.
Operational stations at Caorso, Trino Vercellese and Latina were shut down.
Work on the 2 x 1000MW plant at Montalto di Castro, three quarters
completed, was stopped, and site preparation for a similar plant as
neighbour to the existing station at Trino Vercellese was abandoned. Italy
has produced no electricity from nuclear power since 1987. Mr Viezzoli
believes that there will be no return to nuclear in his lifetime.
But the environmentalists have not limited their objections to nuclear
power. From top to toe of the Italian boot, power station sites have been
targets for verbal 'green' attacks.( In Tuscany it has reached the point
where there is real sabotage, with high voltage lines being toppled.)
Montalto di Castro, on the coast about 70 miles north of Rome, typifies the
difficulties that ENEL has faced over recent years. After pulling out of the
nuclear project, the switch to conventional power(4 x 660MW of multifuel
plant plus 800MW of gas turbine repowering) encountered no serious planning
obstacles, albeit the cost of abandoning nuclear was enormous. But there was
strong opposition to the use of coal.
Now that natural gas will be the main fuel, problems centre on logistics.
Insufficient pipeline capacity means that an LNG terminal is needed. Former
EC environment commissioner Carlo Ripa di Meana, who now holds the
environment portfolio in the Italian government, said in July that studies
need to be made of the environmental impact of the proposed terminal.
It is hard to see Montalto di Castro enjoying trouble-free completion, in
spite of the entry into service of the first gas turbine unit in April. But
since conversion to conventional power, it has made easier progress than two
large projects in the south.
Brindisi Sud in the Apulian heel and Gioia Tauro in the Calabrian toe are
long-running sagas that highlight the difficulties that ENEL has encountered
in siting and building new plant. Authorised in June 1982, work started on
the Brindisi Sud 4 x 660MW plant in November 1983. It was then dogged by
frequent interruptions due to local political disputes and concern over the
plant's environmental impact.
But while the first two units of the Apulian plant are now feeding the grid,
progress at Gioia Tauro is blocked. It is 13 years since the decision was
taken to build a power station at Gioia Tauro, but ENEL seems no nearer to
the finish.
Leaping bureaucratic hurdles has been a problem. So has infiltration by the
local families, eager for their share of the action. This led to the site's
sequestration by armed carabinieri in July 1990. Mr Viezzoli may be
optimistic in expecting the station to enter service at the end of the
decade.
But ENEL is now making better progress in commissioning new plant. After
bringing just 3,400MW of new capacity into service in the five years
1986-1990, 1,280MW started producing last year, followed by a record 3,000MW
this year. 2,000MW is expected in 1993.
Indeed, ENEL's capacity situation is now such that talk about power
black-outs has almost ceased. Slowdown in demand growth helped. After
average annual increases of 4 per cent from 1983 to 1989, Italian
electricity consumption registered growth of 2.8 per cent in 1990; 2.2 per
cent last year and in the first eight months of 1992. From 181TWH in 1983,
demand leapt to 235TWH in 1990, increasing modestly to 240TWH last year.
That black-outs were avoided in the late 1980's owes much to imports. In
1983 net purchases from abroad totalled 11.1TWH and covered 6 per cent of
total demand. Last year net Italian electricity imports were 35.1TWH and
covered nearly 15 per cent of demand.
This import dependence, caused by abandonment of nuclear power and slow
progress on construction programmes, has led ENEL to examine some radical
solutions. The project for a huge artificial man-made power station island
in the Adriatic is still under consideration. So are proposals for building
plant in the Ukraine and Tunisia.
The technical and operational challenges facing ENEL are still considerable.
To these it now adds the institutional and financial challenges of
privatisation. If there is any certainty, it is that ENEL's unified
structure and single national tariff will remain.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (1): The change is positive -
Maastricht treaty conditions require the Italian government to slim down
state ownership of industry and improve its competitiveness. But performance
will depend on radical moves to reduce the public service deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN industry this autumn confronts an awesome list of turbulent
variables, each capable of shattering a crystal ball.
Obvious variables are the inflationary effect of devaluation; high interest
rates and squeezed profits; increased taxes, labour unrest; a weak
government in a fast changing political environment.
In short, the plight of industry can no longer be isolated from the more
general crisis affecting what the press likes to call Azienda Italia (Italy
Incorporated).
Since the April general elections, a way of life which once seemed immutable
is in a state of flux - from the electoral rules, the shape of the political
parties, the nature of the welfare state and the role of the public sector
right down to public morality.
Painfully, at times chaotically, Italy is pointing towards the creation of
new political alignments within a reformed constitution which will tidy up
an unworkable system of proportional representation and produce more stable
government coalitions. The entire public sector is going to be slimmed down
and made more transparent, starting with IRI, the giant holding company.
Irresponsible public spending, which cocooned Italy from the effects of
recession elsewhere, has finally been brought face to face with a crude
reality: the country cannot afford the old subsidies and welfare state which
have been both generous and inefficient. The mountain of debt at over 104
per cent of GDP - the servicing of which accounts for nearly the entire
budget deficit - has risen too high.
Nor will the electorate tolerate the incestuous relationship, now being
exposed by Milan magistrates, between industrialists and politicians,
whereby seemingly every public works contract involves a kick-back paid into
party coffers. It is a time of changing habits and policies in the worst
possible circumstances: an unstable coalition government catching up on
long-delayed political, economic and industrial reform, amid a currency
crisis and a recession. But Italy's change of direction is positive and may
well be irreversible.
Pressure from European partners in Brussels to kick old habits and meet the
demands of convergence are an important factor for change. This 'European'
pressure also has an unusual domestic twist - the fast-growing power of the
populist Lombard League. The latter has broken the hold of the discredited
traditional political parties in the north, and is advocating at best a new
federalism - or, more disturbingly, a form of northern separatism. The logic
of the League is that if Italy as a whole fails to meet EC standards, then
the north will turn its back on the centre and south to cut its own deal
with the D-mark.
The markets are the other external force imposing change. Lack of confidence
in Italy's ability to tackle its uncontrolled public spending and comply
with the minimal criteria for convergence made speculation against the lira
inevitable. Beginning with the April general elections, speculation
culminated in the lira's devaluation on September 14 - in a free float since
September 17, having devalued nearly 20 per cent against the D-mark.
Ironically, this nadir of international confidence comes when Italy for the
first time has a government committed to attack the budget deficit with
structural reform of the principal culprits: pensions, health care, local
administration and the civil service.
In its dealings with the bloated state sector, however, the government's
touch has not been as firm as is needed. The three and a half month-old
Amato government has done itself unnecessary international damage by the
clumsy handling of the liquidation of Efim, the loss-making state industrial
holding. Creditors were kept in the dark, then told at first that Efim's
L3,500bn of foreign debt would be frozen.
Again signals on privatisation have been confused. The government has broken
far too ambiguously the psychological barrier of surrendering 51 per cent
control, and been slow in showing its hand over what is to be sold. Only two
modest sell-offs have been announced: Credito Italiano, the sixth largest
commercial bank controlled by IRI, the state holding; and Nuovo Pignone, the
turbines and engineering subsidiary of ENI, the state oil concern.
Equally, the first attempt in July to reorganise the public sector by
forming two super-holdings had to be quickly dropped. In its place the
treasury has now become sole shareholder of the four main public entities.
IRI, ENI, ENEL (the electricity authority) and INA (the insurance institute)
are now joint stock companies.
This initial step has removed IRI and ENI from the direct tutelage of the
political parties which formerly treated them as fiefdoms for patronage. A
significant opportunity now exists for establishing a coherent industrial
strategy, and the government must decide quickly on the shape this will
take. The opportunity should come at the end of next month, when IRI and ENI
announce their new strategic plans.
The government is understandably torn between realising assets through the
easy sale of 'jewels,' and the longer term creation of units with industrial
logic. Here Italy's rigid labour market, which makes shedding manpower both
costly and controversial, will be put to the test. Elsewhere in Europe,
crisis industries have reacted by shedding labour, while in Italy
loss-making operations are sustained as 'strategic sectors,' largely to
avoid job losses in depressed regions with political clout. Aerospace,
aluminium, chemicals, defence industries, steel and ship-building are the
most glaring examples.
The bottom line will be the need to gain confidence from the markets and
raise money from privatisation - even if a strong body of political opinion
continues to favour sizeable state control. Market sentiment cannot be
lightly ignored these days. The recent decision by IRI to sell off Finsiel,
its software subsidiary, to STET, its telecommunications holding, was
greeted with a 23 per cent fall in STET shares. The market judged this to be
an unnecessary shuffling of assets to boost IRI's balance sheet without
entering a broader international alliance.
Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation, recently prepared a paper
offering the government guidelines for an industrial strategy with five
principal objectives with a view to the private sector playing a more
prominent role: Increase the average size, productive capacity and
capitalisation of companies.
Broaden and strengthen the technological and innovative base of industry in
highly competitive sectors such as textiles, footwear and clothing.
Equip industry to cope better with environmental considerations.
Greater internationalisation, with more transitional alliances and overseas
production/distribution - Italian industry being the least multi-national of
the G-7 countries.
Better territorial distribution of production.
To these laudable objectives might be added improvement in infrastructure, a
more attractive environment for foreign investors and a better developed
financial market. For the world's fifth largest industrial economy, Italy
attracts remarkably little investment.
Over the past 18 months industry itself has been tackling its cost base, and
wages have risen this year at marginally below inflation of 5.2 per cent.
Although pay is still above the European average, the recent devaluation
should provide a competitive edge.
Many small companies, the life-blood of Italian industry, find themselves in
poor shape, caught in a net of costly short term debt, declining domestic
demand and fierce international competition. All companies will also feel
the squeeze from this month's decree imposing a one-off tax on net worth of
7.5 per cent per L1,000.
The unions, for their part, have begun a series of politically motivated
strikes directed both against proposed budget cuts in health care and
pensions and against the prospect of job losses and reduced earnings. The
union leadership is in danger of losing control of growing grass-roots
militancy, and this is likely to complicate the fate of the July outline
agreement ending the scala mobile, the post-war system of indexed wages.
However, the unions are on the defensive over job losses. Resisting the
unions' demands will be a test of the employers' and the government's nerve
in coming weeks.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Japan close to foreign policy reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S foreign ministry is finalising details for overhauling its foreign
policy-making to allow a swifter response to crises and to introduce a more
strategic approach to foreign policy.
The ministry expects that by the end of the year it will complete plans to
create a policy co-ordination bureau which could become the most powerful
centre for foreign policy-making in Japan as the country seeks a wider
political role to match its international economic power.
Traditionally, Japanese foreign policy has closely followed that of the US.
The bureau, which will start work next summer, is likely to be headed by a
senior deputy vice-minister.
It is thought the bureau's head would automatically become a leading
candidate to become the next vice-minister, the most powerful official at
the ministry.
Officials at the Foreign Ministry acknowledge that Japan's foreign policy
has often been too reactive on broad issues and yet too slow-moving in
crises because of the time it takes to establish a policy consensus.
This is partly because the ministry has lacked an effective mechanism to
co-ordinate its own often competing and conflicting bureaux which are housed
in cramped offices along the labyrinthine corridors of the ministry's
building near the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.
This weakness was particularly exposed during the fast-moving events which
led up to the Gulf war, when Japan found it difficult to respond quickly to
allied calls for greater contributions to the allied military effort.
A senior US diplomat closely involved with those efforts explained: 'There
were people whose apparent job was to co-ordinate Japanese policy but it was
difficult to find someone who was doing it effectively.'
The foreign minister's secretariat, which is nominally responsible for
policy co-ordination, is mainly involved in the routine administration of
finances, personnel, upkeep of embassies and despatching telexes.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Mubarak under fire over quake: Riot police deployed after
protests by homeless
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RIOT police were deployed in force near key government buildings and
embassies in Cairo yesterday following a night of disturbances in the city's
inner suburbs.
The protests, fuelled by frustration among thousands of homeless people over
a perceived slow official reaction to last week's earthquake, carried
ominous overtones for the government which has been under increasing
pressure from Islamic extremists.
Police sealed a main thoroughfare through the slum suburb of Boulaq and
fired tear-gas at stone-throwing youths in a night of tension. A bridge
across the Nile was partially closed to prevent protesters crossing into the
Zamalek area where many senior officials live.
Most worrying for the authorities were the angry chants directed against
President Hosni Mubarak plus the conspicuous role of various Islamic groups.
Near the Shura Council, or upper house of the parliament, hundreds
demonstrated on Saturday, giving vent to the frustrations of Cairo's crowded
streets and alleyways.
'Mubarak, you have to collect your shame and get your children off the
streets,' people shouted. 'Where have you been Mubarak - you went asking for
aid and came back to us with a few bars of soap.' Mr Mubarak, who cut short
a visit to China to oversee the relief effort, defended his government's
efforts at a press conference on Saturday.
'I think the government since this problem started has done its maximum . .
.,' he declared. However he conceded that there had been shortcomings in
providing emergency assistance.
'The lesson for the Egyptians and the government and all the authorities in
this country is just to try to educate the people how to react when ever
there is any emergency,' he said.
More than 500 people were killed and some 6,000 injured in the earthquake,
which measured 5.5 on the Richter scale. Government estimates put total
losses at about Dollars 300m (Pounds 174.4m) with 8,000 structures either
destroyed or rendered unsafe.
The ruling National Democratic party has been unnerved, by the speed with
which Islamic groups mobilised to help people in distress. Within hours of
last Monday's disaster, Islamic charitable organisations had established
relief centres in poor neighbourhoods hardest hit by the earthquake.
They wasted no time in providing funds for the destitute and help for
families made homeless. Their activities stood in marked contrast to
official efforts.
The Islamic mainstream Moslem Brotherhood and more overtly militant
religious groups have been mounting a spirited challenge to the government
for the hearts and minds of Egypt's 57m people, many of whom live in
grinding poverty.
Hard-pressed government officials pledged to house the thousands of homeless
within days, and have begun handing out money to quake victims, but Egypt's
bureaucracy has appeared slow to meet the challenge.
The earthquake-inspired disturbances come amid a marked increased of civil
unrest in recent weeks, prompted by widespread economic hardship plus
growing anger at harsh police measures and perceived government corruption.

KUWAIT'S opposition politicians yesterday welcomed the appointment of six
deputies to the cabinet, but complained that the ruling al-Sabah family had
kept its grip on the most powerful ministries.
An unprecedented six deputies from the new 50-seat National Assembly were
awarded seats in the 16-member cabinet, most notably Mr Ali al-Baghli, a
Shia-backed independent candidate during the recent elections, who replaces
Mr Homoud al-Rqobah as oil minister.
The ministries of labour and social affairs, Islamic affairs, commerce and
industry, justice and education also went to deputies who ran broadly
anti-government campaigns during Kuwait's October 5 poll. Opposition
candidates won more than 30 of the 50 seats.
However, members of the al-Sabah family keep hold of the interior, foreign
affairs, defence and information ministries in the cabinet.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Labor party steels itself for WA Inc fall-out: On the eve of
a report on corruption in Western Australia Kevin Brown assesses
implications for federal government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S governing Labor party is bracing itself for the release tomorrow
of a report into the party's involvement in large-scale corruption in
Western Australia (WA).
Dr Carmen Lawrence, the state's embattled Labor premier, commissioned the
report nearly two years ago in the face of rising public anger about
improper dealings between the state government and local entrepreneurs.
The scandal, known as 'WA Inc', centres on the loss of more than ADollars
1bn (Pounds 400m) of taxpayers' money in a series of deals with businessmen
including Mr Alan Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, Mr
Laurie Connell, head of the collapsed Rothwells merchant bank, and the late
Mr Robert Holmes a Court.
The 18-month inquiry has also heard allegations of illegal wire tapping,
corrupt land and property dealing, political manipulation of public
servants, and the sale of political favours for campaign donations.
Most attention is likely to focus on the inquiry's conclusions about the
integrity of the leading Labor figures who ran the state, particularly Mr
Brian Burke, premier from 1983 to 1988, who was widely regarded at the time
as a potential future prime minister.
A stream of witnesses told the inquiry extraordinary tales about the Burke
government's methods, which were said to have included illicit bank
accounts, tampering with government records, and envelopes stuffed with
money kept in ministers' offices.
The government, the inquiry was told, was more influenced by the Australian
phenomenon of 'mateship,' or political cronyism, than by policy commitments.
Dealing with Labor, one witness said, was like dealing with the Mafia.
The report could prove to be a death blow for Dr Lawrence's government,
which has already lost its parliamentary majority.
The loss of power in WA would be a serious psychological blow to Mr Paul
Keating's federal Labor government.
But the federal government may also be damaged by allegations that some of
the illicit money raised in WA found its way to Canberra to help finance
national election campaigns in 1987 and 1990.
Evidence given to the inquiry suggested that Mr Burke raised more than
ADollars 6m from a dozen or so business donors over about seven years, not
all of which has been accounted for.
Inquiry staff say the report will address the issue of whether the federal
party benefited from the WA fund-raising, or whether the money remained in
Perth, as the federal party claims.
The conservative opposition parties have attempted to link the federal
government to the WA fund-raising by drawing attention to a lunch in Perth
at which Mr Bob Hawke, the then prime minister, discussed campaign donations
with Mr Bond, Mr Connell and others.
Much has been made, too, of a fishing trip hosted by Mr Connell in which he
was joined by Mr Hawke and Senator Graham Richardson, then a senior federal
cabinet minister and Labor power broker.
Little hard evidence has emerged to link Canberra to illicit activities,
which have been strongly denied by Mr Hawke and other cabinet ministers and
Labor officials. However, the opposition will be quick to exploit any
suggestion that the federal party's ties to WA were not entirely above
board.
The report is expected to recommend sweeping changes to the system of
government in WA, mainly to increase parliamentary scrutiny and prevent the
appointment of cronies to sensitive public service positions.
The parliamentary system of government, inherited from British colonial
rule, is expected to survive. But the inquiry will probably call for a
Freedom of Information Act, protection for public service 'whistleblowers,'
disclosure of politicians' financial interests, and an anti-corruption
commission.
The inquiry may also recommend criminal charges against individuals. Charges
have already been brought against Mr Bond, Mr Connell, Mr Burke and several
others, including Mr David Parker, the lawyer who preceded Dr Lawrence as
premier.
Mr Burke, who became Australian ambassador to Ireland and the Vatican after
stepping down as premier, was forced to resign last year, a month after
beginning to give evidence to the inquiry. He continues to deny any
wrongdoing.
Dr Lawrence, who is not personally embroiled in the scandal, has promised to
implement all the inquiry's recommendations in the hope of distancing her
administration from its predecessors.
However, the signs are that the report will mark the beginning of the end
for the state government, and possibly for the federal government, which
must do well in WA to win the next federal election, due by June.
Labor cannot even hope to get all the bad news out of the way in one fell
swoop. At least three other inquiries are being held into various aspects of
'WA Inc,' including one by the Australian Securities Commission, the
national corporate watchdog. All are likely to prove equally embarrassing.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Fortress Europe keeps eastern neighbours out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the European Community fiddles with constitutional definitions, the
east European market experiments risk going up in flames. Only increased
trade with their rich and populous neighbours offer hope of a prosperous
future for the ex-Comecon countries. But while the EC mouths words of
friendship towards the east, its actions remain unwelcoming.
The EC approach towards eastern Europe has been disingenuous from the
outset. The association agreements, signed less than a year ago with Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, appeared to offer the promise of free trade and
eventual membership of the Community. But the reality is somewhat different,
as Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, pointed out last month in a speech calling for the association
agreements to be torn up and replaced by agreements offering more generous
access to EC markets.
The devil is in the detail. There is no hiding the fact that the Common
Agricultural Policy precludes free trade in agricultural products. But the
agreements, while reducing tariffs and quotas for non-agricultural exports,
left a number of barriers to trade in 'import-sensitive' products including
iron and steel, chemicals and textiles and apparel. Along with agriculture,
these sensitive products account for 33 per cent of Czech and Slovak exports
to the EC, 42 per cent of Polish exports, and 51 per cent of Hungarian
exports.
Even this modest liberalisation risks being undermined by the provisions
covering rules of origin, safeguards and standards, as Mr Patrick Messerlin
predicted in a paper cited in this space (EC Protectionism Threatens East
European Growth: FT, 13.4.92). His fears have already been proved correct,
as the FT confirmed in a recent report, (Czechoslovak Steel Sales to EC
Curbed: FT, 19.8.92). 'The European Commission has authorised Germany,
France and Italy to restrict some steel imports from Czechoslovakia after
they complained about a big rise in cheap shipments,' the report said.
Why is the EC unwilling to offer free trade? Maybe these sensitive products
are located in especially vulnerable regions within the EC economy. Perhaps
east European competition poses a substantial threat which will cause
serious adjustment difficulties within EC countries.
The suspicion is that these trade barriers are there because declining
industries are able to use their substantial lobbying power in pursuit of
their private, rather than the public, interest. That is the implication of
preliminary research by Mr Jim Rollo of the Royal Institute of International
Affairs and Mr Alasdair Smith of the University of Sussex, the results of
which will appear in the next issue of Economic Policy ('The political
economy of central European trade with the European Community: why so
sensitive?').
These sensitive products do constitute a non-negligible share of employment
and value-added in EC countries. Excluding food and food products, they
account for 5.4 per cent of total EC employment. The share is much higher in
exposed regions in France, Germany and southern Italy.
Yet eastern European exports are tiny in relation to the size of the EC
market. Imports of sensitive manufactures from eastern Europe are, in all
cases, equivalent to less than 1 per cent of total EC gross production, as
the upper chart shows. Even on what the authors describe as the worst-case
scenario for EC producers -    a 400 per cent rise in east European exports
of sensitive products -    the result would be only modest falls in EC
production in each sector, ranging from 4.6 per cent in textiles to 1.3 per
cent in food products.
Yet trade politics requires vociferous opposition, even though producer
losses are small. Trade liberalisation would deliver gains to consumers in
the form of lower prices which would more than outweigh the producer losses.
But allowing consumers to learn they gain from free trade would be dangerous
for Europe's producer lobbies. The EC also appears willing to keep consumers
in the dark, and east European exports out in the cold.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Tax raids add to Bombay stock exchange confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONFUSION reigned in scandal-hit Bombay financial markets over the weekend,
following income tax raids on leading stockbrokers. Trading on the Bombay
Stock Exchange halted on Friday when 250 tax investigators entered 50
brokers' offices, and it was unclear if it would re-open today.
Bombay stock market officials said the governing body would meet at 10am to
decide. The market was due to be closed today for a regular fortnightly
settlement day, but in view of Friday's exceptional closure, some officials
felt it would be wrong to have trading suspended for four days in
succession. Many brokers believe that, if the tax raids continue, trading
will be impracticable.
The investigations follow official inquiries into the securities market
scandal which erupted in April, causing trading to be suspended for a month.
The raids will hit efforts by the government of Mr Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister, to encourage foreign investment in India's financial markets.
Tax officials have not publicly explained the raids, but their targets
included several brokers alleged to have been implicated in the securities
market scandal and one leading Bombay financier. The searches were launched
on settlement day, when brokers' offices are full of share documents.
Mr MR Mayya, the Bombay Stock Exchange's executive director, said trading
would probably not resume today.
The raids could undermine investors' confidence for some time. Share prices
have been falling steadily as the investigation has dragged on and
confidence has waned in the government's ability to carry out promised
economic reforms. The Bombay stock market index of leading shares stood at
3,086.45 at Thursday's close, against 3,300 in mid-September.
The scandal's political impact could widen amid opposition calls for the
resignation of Mr B. Shankaranand, oil and gas minister, who is also
chairman of the Oil Industry Development Board (OIDB), a state-owned
corporation. According to evidence to a parliamentary committee, the OIDB
placed money with banks for investment in the securities markets, in
defiance of a government ban on state-owned corporations doing so.

Mr Banda said the referendum by secret ballot would be held 'as soon as

FT  19 OCT 92 / Babangida's troubles grow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military government seemed increasingly beleaguered at the
weekend, as growing doubts about transition to civilian rule worsened the
country's economic crisis.
President Ibrahim Babangida's decision on Friday to nullify the results of
presidential primaries and dissolve the leadership of the two permitted
political parties makes the planned January 2, 1993, handover look
unrealistic.
The probable delay also means no early end to the drift in economic
management creditors and donors hoped a new government would end. The drift
has left Nigeria without an IMF agreement for the past year, a precondition
to urgently-needed rescheduling of its Dollars 30bn (Pounds 17.4bn) external
debt. 'Without it,' a western banker said last night, 'Nigeria's prospects
are grim.' Nevertheless, many politicians have backed the move, in some
cases because it gives defeated candidates a second chance.
'Babangida's decision is most welcome. What happened (in the primaries) was
totally devoid of public morality,' Mr Lateef Jakande, a former civilian
governor of Lagos and a candidate in the Social Democratic party (SDP),
said. A spokesman for Mr Umaru Shinkafi, a front-runner in the National
Republican Convention (NRC), was also in favour.
Whether the politicians' reactions reflect the view of the electorate,
increasingly cynical about the leadership qualities of both soldiers and
civilians, is another matter. 'What option do we have but to go along with
it?' one Lagos businessman asked last night. 'One thing is sure: the
government remains unpopular.'
But the resilience of Gen Babangida, who seized power in August 1985, should
not be underestimated, his critics warn. By restructuring the armed forces
and ensuring key units are within reach of the presidential HQ in Abuja, the
federal capital, he has made himself a formidable adversary for would-be
successors.
The president's criticism of the politicians would carry more weight if he
presided over a more honest administration. Corruption continues to permeate
the government, undermining political and economic reform programmes.
Gen Babangida has not spelt out the implications of Friday's announcement
for the timetable of the handover, which envisages a presidential poll on
December 5, although stressing he remained pledged to civilian rule. But in
a comment some Nigerians have interpreted as a hint that the handover may be
delayed, he stressed: 'Let me correct one thing. The National Electoral
Commission does not determine the lifespan of this administration.'
On the economic front, news is bleak. The IMF programme renewed in January
1991 had lapsed by the end of the year. The 1991 budget deficit was 35.5bn
naira 12.4 per cent of GDP, against a target of N100m surplus. Continuing
fiscal and monetary indiscipline has since prompted a warning from the
central bank alarmed at inflation running at 27 per cent and rising. 'The
mounting inflationary pressures were the result of undesirable macroeconomic
trends characterised by excessive monetary expansion, large fiscal deficits
and exchange rate depreciation,' the bank said last August.
It may well be the president set himself impossible tasks. He took on a
political elite which, as the recent presidential primaries showed,
continues to buy votes and bribe electoral officers, and underestimated the
economic challenge. But for many Nigerians, the man who promised to clean up
Nigeria's political system, and launched a structural adjustment programme
in 1986, has failed on both counts.

THE US and EC have expressed confidence that substantial progress will be
made in a matter of days towards resolving the impasse on agricultural trade
which is holding up the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks.
Mr Frans Andriessen, EC commissioner for external relations, warned after
meeting trade ministers of the US, Japan and Canada at the weekend the
breakthrough would not amount to a 'deal' on the remaining issues of farm
subsidies and oilseeds output.
But he said negotiators should have made sufficient progress for
multilateral talks to be resumed in Geneva.
The four ministers at the meeting, in a country inn 100km west of Toronto,
reaffirmed their determination to conclude the Uruguay Round under the
General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade by the end of this year. However, Mrs
Carla Hills, US trade representative, said no meeting had been scheduled
between Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary, and Mr Ray MacSharry, EC
farm commissioner.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Warning of Russian coup: Liberal ministers see threat to
Yeltsin and his reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN President Boris Yeltsin's closest liberal colleagues have charged
that an alliance of parliamentarians, industrial managers and nostalgic
communists are plotting to overthrow his government and derail radical
market reforms.
The charges were presented to a group of foreign correspondents by Mr
Gennady Burbulis, a top presidential adviser, Mr Mikhail Poltoranin, the
first deputy prime minister who heads the Information Ministry, Mr Anatoly
Chubais, the first deputy premier responsible for privatisation, and Mr
Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister.
'We are seeing the ripening of not just serious opposition but of the open
and strongest preparation of a coup d'etat,' Mr Poltoranin told the
correspondents at a meeting initiated by him and his colleagues on Friday
evening. He said preparations for what a parliamentary leader described as a
'coup by constitutional means' were being made under the aegis of Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the chairman of the Russian parliament.
Although coup warnings are not new to Moscow, this one was notable for the
seniority and number of ministers who made it, as well as for its
specificity. A senior parliamentarian who declined to be identified said the
plotters aimed to achieve their ends by constitutional means at a session of
Russia's supreme legislative body, the Congress of People's Deputies, which
is set for December 1 but which Mr Yeltsin wants postponed until next
spring.
Mr Burbulis said the co-ordinated interaction of forces opposing radical
reforms was orchestrated from the Russian parliament building and involved
extreme communist groups such as Edinstvo (Unity), as well as the support of
conservative industrial managers and deputies.
He also alleged the involvement of the Civic Union group, headed by Mr
Arkady Volsky, leader of an industrialists' union, and Vice-President
Alexander Rutskoi.
Mr Poltoranin said Mr Khasbulatov had sanctioned the creation of shadowy
armed groups, press conferences on parliamentary premises by former Soviet
deputies who want a return to communism, and the establishment in parliament
of an organising committee for salvation committees.
Mr Chubais said the timing set by parliamentarians for the congress was not
accidental, as it was designed to stop a mass privatisation of industrial
enterprises due to start in January.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Sarajevo shelled as aid returns

<TEXT>
SERBIAN tanks yesterday fired shells on Sarajevo just after the relief
supply route to the besieged Bosnian capital was reopened.
At least 17 people died and 150 wounded were taken to city hospitals after
the artillery and tank attack yesterday morning, which Bosnian military
leaders said was started by Serbs in retaliation for a breakdown in
negotiations over exchanging bodies of those killed in earlier battles.
Hundreds of tonnes of food and medicine yesterday were awaiting delivery to
Sarajevo after a four-day dispute between Bosnian and United Nations
commanders over control of the road from the airport to the city was ended.
Citing a planned Serbian advance, Bosnian forces on Thursday had blocked the
road, used to bring international aid from the airport to the 380,000
inhabitants trapped by a Serbian siege for nearly seven months. Commanders
yesterday said they were lifting their blockade out of concern for the
people of Sarajevo, whose lives depended on the vital supply route. The city
for weeks has been without electricity and water.
While the airport road was reopened, United Nations officials said the
shipment of aid along the overland route from Mostar, southern
Bosnia-Hercegovina, at the weekend was suspended after two convoys of the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees were shelled. In addition to food and
medicines, relief workers plan to distribute plastic sheeting for roofs and
windows.
Mr Dobrica Cosic, the president of Yugoslavia, yesterday appealed for the
Serbian siege round Sarajevo to be lifted and for the demilitarisation of
the city. Before flying from Belgrade to Geneva for talks with Croatian and
Bosnian leaders, Mr Cosic said: 'It is not to fulfil international demands
and get the sanctions lifted but because of a moral and humane need to end
the suffering.' Mr Cosic, a well-known writer who has wielded great
influence in Serbian politics, called on Friday for the resignation of
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, seen by the international community as
the chief instigator of the violence in Bosnia.
Reuter adds from Belgrade: UN human rights investigator Tadeusz Mazowiecki,
a former Polish prime minister, said yesterday that rights in Serbia's
volatile Kosovo province were being seriously abused. Speaking a day after
his return from the province, which has an ethnic Albanian majority, he
warned of civil unrest there.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Rise in German demand boosts new car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW car sales in west Europe rose by an estimated 4.7 per cent in September,
the strongest monthly year-on-year increase this year, thanks to a rise in
demand in Germany and smaller European markets.
According to industry estimates, new car sales in west Europe last month
rose to 942,000, from 899,000 in the same month a year ago. The rise in
demand in September, which followed a 3 per cent increase year-on-year in
August, has begun to compensate for the weakness in sales earlier this year.
However, new car sales of 10.5m in the first nine months of the year were
still 1.5 per cent below the 10.7m achieved in the same period a year ago.
Last month's improvement was widely spread, with higher sales in 11 of 17
markets across Europe.
Significantly, new car sales in Germany rose last month by an estimated 18.5
per cent to 277,000 from the low level of last year, when demand dropped
sharply.
In the first nine months of the year, new car sales in Germany were an
estimated 9.3 per cent lower than a year ago. European car makers expected
demand in Germany to fall more sharply this year after the record sales of
1991, when unification boosted sales to a record 4.2m from only 3.3m a year
earlier.
In September, new car sales in France rose by 3.8 per cent to 147,400 but
demand remained weak in the UK, with a 4 per cent fall from an already very
depressed level. Sales in Italy, previously one of the strongest markets in
Europe, also declined by 3.7 per cent year-on-year. Most of the smaller
European markets performed more strongly in September and lower sales were
recorded only in Sweden, Switzerland, Belgium and Luxembourg in addition to
Italy and the UK.
Among the big six volume car makers, the Volkswagen group of Germany and
Renault of France posted the strongest growth in west Europe this year. The
state-owned French car maker increased its sales volume by an estimated 5
per cent in the first nine months.
The VW group, which includes Audi, Seat and Skoda, has built a record lead
in west Europe this year, helped by the waning challenge from the Fiat group
of Italy. Fiat, which includes Lancia and Alfa Romeo, has slipped from
second to fourth place in the first nine months behind General Motors
(Opel/Vauxhall and Saab) and the Peugeot group of France, which includes
Citroen.
Fiat has suffered a 7.4 per cent drop in its sales volume, which has
depressed its west European market share to only 12 per cent in the first
nine months from 12.8 per cent a year ago.
Ford is the other big loser in west Europe this year. A 6 per cent drop in
sales volume has forced it to impose short-time working at many European car
assembly plants. The share of Japanese car makers in west Europe has also
declined this year, with sales falling by 7.6 per cent in the first 9
months. This has depressed their market share to 11.9 per cent from 12.7 per
cent a year ago.
Among the executive and luxury car makers, Mercedes-Benz has continued to
lose ground to BMW and Audi, its arch rivals. Mercedes-Benz, which is due to
replace its smallest 190 series early next year, has suffered an estimated
11.2 per cent drop in sales volume this year and has slipped behind both BMW
and Audi in market share. BMW has increased its sales by 9.4 per cent,
helped by the success of its 3-series, while Audi has increased its sales by
around 8.5 per cent.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Queen has chance to repair German links

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME of Germany's media commentators appear to believe that Britain's Queen
Elizabeth is arriving on a state visit today to patch up the unseemly
squabble in Anglo-German relations over who forced sterling to devalue.
Two facts suggest otherwise.
In the first place, the trip has been planned with painstaking attention to
diplomatic detail for the past 18 months. And second, the latest squabble
needs patching up in Britain, not in Germany, where it has attracted little
attention.
For all that, the Queen's visit to Bonn, Berlin, Dresden and Leipzig over
the next five days could scarcely have been better timed to pour some balm
on relations which have been troubled ever since unification.
It was Lady Thatcher's truculent acceptance of German unification in 1990
which did cause diplomatic upset, and which the Queen now has a unique
chance to set to rights with a trip concentrated very much in the former
East Germany.
Queen Elizabeth is hugely popular in Germany, on both sides of the old
divide. She is even called jokingly 'our best German', thanks to her
extensive German ancestry - underlined by the British embassy in the
publication of family trees both for the Queen and for Prince Philip, all of
whose sisters are German princesses.
She is coming for the third time on a state visit to Germany, putting the
country on a par with only France and the US in the British royal perception
of importance - a fact which has also been widely reported.
Indeed, she is coming about two years ahead of her normal schedule, because
'she wanted to visit Germany as soon as possible after unification', and in
order 'to demonstrate the British commitment to the new federal states (in
East Germany)', according to the briefing given to the German press by Sir
Christopher Mallaby, the British ambassador.
Her visit to Dresden to attend a service of 'reconciliation and remembrance'
in the Kreuzkirche, the cathedral which was heavily damaged in the allied
bombing of the city in 1945, will be the most sensitive on both sides. There
are fears of counter-demonstrations by right-wing extremists from the German
side, and thunderous editorials in British newspapers if the Queen were to
breathe a word suggesting British remorse for the fire bombings.
As for the latest Anglo-German squabble, the only sign that it has been
taken into account is that Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the German
Bundesbank and blamed by the British Treasury for wittingly or unwittingly
talking down sterling on the currency markets, will be invited not once, but
twice to meet the Queen.
But perhaps that is simply confirmation that nobody on the banks of the
Rhine has noticed the row.

A majority of Danes would vote for the Maastricht treaty in a second

treaty which the government is seeking, writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
An opinion poll published at the weekend found that 55 per cent would vote
for the treaty on these conditions, with 20 per cent against. Fifteen per
cent would be undecided and 10 per cent would not vote.
Respondents were asked how they would vote if the other 11 EC governments
conceded Danish demands for more democratic decision-making, less
bureaucracy, and Danish exemption from participation in a common defence
policy and currency.

FT  19 OCT 92 / EC budget talks reopen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC finance ministers will today reopen detailed discussion of the Community
budget, amid growing concern that governments are growing no closer to
solving Europe's fundamental economic problems.
The ministers will consider the outcome of last Friday's emergency summit of
EC leaders, who avoided in-depth debate on the EC's economic difficulties -
the original catalyst for the Birmingham meeting - in favour of a broad
declaration pledging greater openness and democracy.
On a more optimistic note, British officials hope today's meeting in
Luxembourg will produce at least one prize for the UK's troubled presidency
of the Community - a formal accord on value added tax (VAT) and excise
duties across the EC. By last Friday intensive bilateral discussions between
member states had almost eliminated the tiny objections which prevented
unanimous agreement on the package in July.
Discussion on the Delors II package of 1993-97 budget measures will revolve
around the practical application of the cohesion fund, aimed at bringing
poorer member states' economies into line with those of the wealthy EC
countries.
Ministers will try to decide how strictly to apply the conditions for
cohesion funding, which is available to member states with a per capita
gross national product of less than 90 per cent of the Community average -
provided they take firm action to improve their economic performance. The
Commission, backed by the poorer countries, is suggesting that such
conditions should not be applied until three years after the fund is
established.
Ministers will also discuss how the funds should be distributed and the sort
of projects which might be eligible for funding.

FT  19 OCT 92 / W German retail sales fall 5.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor and DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL sales in western Germany fell by a real 5.1 per cent in August, the
German Federal Statistics Office has announced, writes David Waller in
Frankfurt.
The figures, which come shortly after statistics showing that the level of
industrial orders fell in August for the sixth consecutive month, provide
further evidence of stagnation in the German economy.
The retail figures show that the Bundesbank's high interest rates had begun
to affect German consumers even before the economy was hit by the sharp
appreciation of the D-Mark recently.
The appreciation has damaged prospects for export-oriented Germany still
further, as underscored by Friday's announcement from MAN - one of the
largest engineering groups - that orders had dropped by 22 per cent between
July and September, against the same period last year.
September's producer prices, by contrast, suggest a slight easing of
inflationary pressures. They rose by 0.8 per cent against the same month
last year, whereas in July and August prices rose by 1.1 per cent.
In the light of the poor data, economists are modifying their estimates for
growth in west German GDP; Goldman Sachs, for example, has recently scaled
back its 1993 growth prognosis from 2-2.5 to 0.5 per cent.
Mr Theo Waigel, German finance minister, has welcomed the offer from the
country's most powerful union to hold back pay rises for five years to no
more than is required to maintain purchasing power, adds David Goodhart,
Labour Editor.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of I G Metall, offered the pay pact under a
solidarity accord designed to place financing of German unification on a
sounder footing. But he insisted that the burdens of reunification should
not just fall on wage earners.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Republicans feel wind of change in Michigan: Clinton poised
 to win pivotal state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DON'T let the polls get you down,' is Governor John Engler's message to his
fellow Republicans in President George Bush's Michigan campaign team. Mr
Engler and his campaign workers know what it is like to pull off an election
upset: he trailed his Democratic opponent, incumbent Governor James
Blanchard, by 14 points just two days before balloting for Michigan's
governorship in 1990.
'We easily could see something of that magnitude again,' he said yesterday.
But as Michigan chairman of the Bush re-election campaign, Mr Engler may
face an even more daunting task of resurrection.
While Michigan has often voted Democratic in state and congressional
elections, it has not favoured a Democratic presidential candidate since
Hubert Humphrey in 1968.
This year that might change: polls in the state show Governor Bill Clinton,
the Democratic nominee, leading Mr Bush by anywhere from 13 to 19 percentage
points, with about 10 per cent backing the independent, Mr Ross Perot.
Ms Colleen Pero, an Engler aide seconded to run the Bush campaign in
Michigan, warns that polls conducted by organisations from outside the state
systematically over-sample areas with low voter turnout.
All the same, Republicans admit their internal polling shows the president 9
or 10 points behind Mr Clinton.
They also acknowledge it is hard to envisage a scenario in which Mr Bush
wins re-election without winning this pivotal mid-western state's 18
electoral college votes.
There is nothing very special about the issues that are swaying Michigan
voters in this election. 'It's jobs, jobs and more jobs; the economy, jobs
and taxes over and over again,' says Ms Pero.
'I don't think Michigan is significantly different from the nation as a
whole. In fact I think it is a very good reflector,' says Professor David
Rohde, a political scientist at Michigan State University in East Lansing.
While Michigan has not suffered the same sharp economic downturn during the
Bush presidency as, say, California, it has been familiar for years with
lay-offs and plant closures - the latest being General Motors' Willow Run
assembly line. Unemployment, at 9.4 per cent in July, remains significantly
higher than the national average.
Some of the issues that Mr Bush has emphasised cut both ways in Michigan.
The recently concluded North American Free Trade Agreement, for example,
worries car industry and other unionised workers in the Detroit area. But
Nafta is viewed more positively in the furniture industry around Grand
Rapids, which exports heavily to Mexico, as well as in Sault Sainte Marie in
Michigan's icy Upper Peninsula, which is growing fast on the strength of
open trade with its sister city in Ontario.
Bush campaign officials hope some of the local referendum issues which will
share the ballot on November 3 could draw out voters more favourable to the
president. These measures include proposals to cut property taxes, to limit
the number of terms that could be served by elected officials, and to roll
back car insurance rates in exchange for a cap on accident medical benefit
payments.
They are also optimistic about Republican chances in Michigan's
congressional elections. The state's population stagnated in the 1980s and,
in consequence, it lost two seats in the 10-yearly redistribution of seats
that takes effect this year.
The result has been to add Republican voters to the districts of several
Democratic congressmen. State Republican campaigners believe they have good
chances of ousting such incumbents as Congressmen Bob Carr, William Ford and
perhaps even David Bonior, the House majority whip.
Some even suggest that the prospect of victory in these congressional races
could stimulate Republican voters and help Mr Bush. Certainly, few expect
the traditional 'coat-tails' effect where the president helps his party's
candidates lower down the ticket.
'This is, has been and will remain an 'against' election, and not a 'for'
election,' says Prof Rohde.
But former Governor Blanchard, who is heading Mr Clinton's Michigan
campaign, knows from personal experience not to underestimate the electoral
skills of his old nemesis, Mr Engler.
Mr Blanchard must avoid the low turnout which cost him the 1990 governor's
election. That will require 'get out the vote' activities in heavily
Democratic Detroit city, but also among the 'Reagan Democrats' of Detroit's
blue-collar suburbs.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Iraq appealed for BNL help '10 years ago'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIDES to Iraq's President Saddam Hussein first approached Banca Nazionale
del Lavoro (BNL) in Italy seeking help to finance arms procurement as early
as a decade ago, according to a highly placed US intelligence official.
Until now the only role BNL is known to have played in helping Baghdad to
fund its military build-up was by way of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.9bn) of
illegal Iraqi loans extended by the bank's Atlanta branch between 1985 and
1989.
A confidential 1991 cable sent from US officials in Rome to the Washington
headquarters of the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA), reported that a BNL
branch in the northern Italian city of Brescia was used by Iraq to pay for
the shipment to Iraq of 9m land mines worth Dollars 225m. A copy of the DIA
report has been obtained by the Financial Times.
In Rome, a senior BNL executive said on Friday that a review of the bank's
archives revealed that between 1981 and 1984 Baghdad asked BNL to open three
letters of credit totalling Dollars 155.3m at the BNL Brescia branch.
However, he said these were never confirmed and therefore never utilised by
Iraq.
BNL's top management was changed in 1989 in the wake of the Atlanta scandal.
The BNL letters of credit were understood to be in favour of Valsella
Meccanotecnica, which is 50 per cent owned by the Fiat group.
Last year several executives of Valsella were convicted and sentenced to
jail for illegally selling anti-personnel and anti-tank mines to Iraq during
the 1980s. The executives were then pardoned as part of an Italian amnesty.
The disclosure that Iraq tried to use BNL in Italy for arms purchases a full
four years before the illegal Atlanta loans began to flow is certain to
complicate the Bush administration's contention that BNL's head office in
Rome never knew of the US branch's Iraqi dealings.
In recent days officials of the CIA and Department of Justice have admitted
in closed Senate hearings that they deliberately concealed reports on Rome's
involvement in the BNL scandal from Atlanta prosecutors and a federal court
judge.
Senator Al Gore, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, charged last
week that the BNL affair, dubbed 'Iraqgate' in the US media, was part of an
administration cover-up larger than the Watergate scandal.
On Friday Mr William Barr, the US attorney-general, rejected calls for a
special prosecutor in the BNL affair and appointed a retired judge from New
Jersey to investigate possible criminal wrongdoing by administration
officials handling the BNL case.
In the face of strong congressional criticism Mr Barr said a new BNL
task-force would also investigate 'the possible complicity of persons in
BNL-Rome'.
The DIA report, dated February 15 1991, was one of a series sent from Rome
to Washington concerning the illegal sale of land mines to Iraq, according
to the US intelligence official. The report stated that the Valsella mines
were sent to Iraq 'through circuitous routes involving Singapore,
Switzerland and BNL office in Brescia, Italy.'
The DIA document, which said the last shipment was as late as 1987, noted
that among the mines shipped to Iraq were VS-1.6 and VS-2.2 anti-tank mines
and VS-50 and Valmara 69 anti-personnel mines. Valsella stopped producing
these mines last year.
Mr Gualberto Ranieri, a Fiat spokesman, said the Turin-based group did not
wish to comment except to stress that it never had 'management control of
Valsella'.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Clinton would speed growth programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton, the frontrunner in the US presidential election, is
considering ways of speeding up implementation of his plans to stimulate
growth after mounting evidence that the economic slowdown is set to
continue.
Mr Clinton said he had been worried by a speech delivered in Tokyo last week
by Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, which warned
that the US faced an economic downturn of a kind not seen since 1945, and
which might prove more protracted than previous recessions this century.
'I think it's something we need to look at - getting people to work again,
getting incomes up . . . there's some other things we might be able to do to
bump this economy some,' Mr Clinton said.
The Democratic candidate's economic advisers, however, were at pains over
the weekend to underline their commitment to keeping to a target of cutting
the federal budget deficit in half over four years.
A report in the Los Angeles Times that Mr Clinton was considering a new
stimulus package provoked anxiety in the financial markets, which are
already worried about the prospects for bringing the budget deficit under
control. Long bond prices fell sharply on Friday.
Mr Gene Sperling, the campaign's economic policy director, dismissed the
report and said Mr Clinton had not asked for an accelerated recovery
programme. He added that there was 'no consensus on any specific plan' among
the Arkansas governor's advisers. Other advisers, however, said they were
considering ways to 'front-load' the Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.6bn) a year of
infrastructure investment that Mr Clinton has already proposed, without
actually increasing spending over a longer period.
Democratic campaign managers are concerned that talk of a new growth package
might open Mr Clinton to renewed attacks from President George Bush, who has
already tried to paint his opponent as a 'tax-and-spend liberal'.
They want to avoid anything in the last two weeks of the campaign that could
shake Mr Clinton's commanding lead in both national and state-by-state
opinion polls.
Any new stimulus package that seems likely to increase the already yawning
deficit would also draw unfavourable comparisons with Mr Ross Perot, the
independent candidate who has built a following by proposing harsh medicine
to deal with the national debt.
In half-hour television advertisements this weekend, Mr Perot added flesh to
his economic proposals, sketching a five-year plan to eliminate the deficit.
The plan includes Dollars 315bn of discretionary government spending cuts
over the five years, and savings of Dollars 268bn on entitlement programmes
from measures such as higher premiums for Medicare, the US health insurance
for people 65 and over.
Mr Perot also wants Dollars 342bn of tax increases, mostly derived from the
proposal he has already outlined for increasing the petrol tax by 10 cents a
year over five years.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Monthly retail sales show slight rise on a year ago
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RETAIL sales in September were slightly better than a year ago, marking the
first year-on-year increase since May, according to the distributive trades
survey published today by the Confederation of British Industry.
Sales rose in spite of high unemployment and debt levels, which have hit
consumer confidence and spending power. Retailers, however, fear that
September's rise will be reversed this month, according to the CBI survey,
which was carried out before the recent announcement of mining redundancies.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel, said
the September rise 'is clearly good news, but it is difficult for retailers
to judge which way things will move in the months ahead'.
Government figures for September retail sales, to be published on Wednesday,
are expected to confirm the small year- on-year rise. According to MMS
International, a financial information company, the median of City
expectations is that they will show a 0.7 per cent rise compared to
September 1991, but a 0.3 per cent fall on August.
According to the CBI report, the September increase was driven by sales of
clothing, furniture and confectionery, partly offset by sharp falls in sales
by chemists, household goods and off-licences. Volumes were considered poor
for the time of year throughout most of retailing. The London economy has
deteriorated further, according to the latest Quarterly Economic Trends
survey published today by the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
Conducted after Black Wednesday, September 16, when the pound left the
European exchange rate mechanism, the survey says that 'expectations for
turnover and profitability for the year ahead are significantly less
optimistic than at any time during the past 15 months'.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Cabinet ordered to emergency meeting on pits: Number of
backbench critics nears the 11 needed to defeat government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night summoned an emergency cabinet meeting for this
morning over plans to close 31 coal mines amid signs that the government
would be defeated in the Commons this week over the proposals.
The decision to call the cabinet meeting followed a series of crisis
meetings during the day by party managers and raised the possibility that
the prime minister may be prepared to concede a delay or changes to the
plans.
However, ministers had earlier insisted that there was no alternative to the
plans as set out by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, last
week.
Mr Heseltine will make a statement to the Commons after this morning's
cabinet meeting.
The backbench revolt by Tory MPs against the proposed closures, which would
cost more than 30,000 coal miners' jobs, grew rapidly over the weekend with
the number of Tories promising to vote against the government in Wednesday's
coal debate fast approaching the number required to wipe out its majority.
With other Tories warning privately that they would defy whips by voting
against or abstaining, a humiliating defeat last night looked likely unless
Mr Heseltine's statement offered substantial modifications.
Mr Winston Churchill, Tory MP for Davyhulme, said that if the government
lost, Mr Heseltine's position as trade and industry secretary would be
untenable.
As the government faced its most perilous week since Mr Major became prime
minister nearly two years ago, officials and ministers were working on a
package believed to include at least training and other measures for coal
mining communities.
Downing Street last night refused to comment on speculation that the closure
plan might be postponed pending an inquiry, saying only that the economic
case for closure remained clear.
The prime minister will face strongly worded criticism when he lunches today
with the executive of the backbench Conservative MPs 1922 committee -
criticism of his handling of the economy and the Maastricht treaty as well
as the pit closures. One 1922 executive member said: 'I'm still loyal to
John Major. I hope he survives. But he won't if he continues in this way.'
The government's claim that keeping open the 31 pits due for closure would
cost tax-payers Pounds 100m a month came under fire from British Coal
officials.
The figure is based on the calculation that at current production levels 2m
tonnes a month would be unsold next year, at a production cost of Pounds 50
a tonne. British Coal officials say the production cost is lower and that
the coal could in fact be sold on the world market, at a loss that would be
far less than Pounds 100m.
Adding to the air of crisis, a protest march by miners to Westminster has
been organised for Wednesday while the Trades Union Congress plans a large
London rally on Sunday.
In Cheltenham Spa yesterday, 3,000 miners' supporters marched through the
town to protest against pit closures. Last night, following a call by Mr Roy
Lynk, leader of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers, for a two-minute
nationwide blackout at 9pm, the National Grid Company said there was a small
fall in demand equivalent to 2m light bulbs.
The Coalfield Communities Campaign will today try to stop the pit closures
by asking for a judicial review of the 'failure' of the Office of
Electricity Regulation to ensure electricity is produced from the cheapest
fuel - which it says is coal. Leaders of unions representing nuclear power
workers are also expected to back the miners.
Mr Heseltine's statement will include help for redundant miners, and others
whose jobs are threatened by the closures, via the employer-led Training and
Enterprise Councils. He may also give mining areas special status to
encourage economic regeneration. But it was unclear last night how much
extra money he would win from the Treasury in addition to the Pounds 1bn,
mainly for redundancy payments, he announced last week.
Mr Heseltine has angered at least one cabinet minister - Mrs Gillian
Shephard, employment secretary - for failing to ensure his colleagues were
properly briefed before the announcement of closures last Tuesday. But
yesterday he said that colleagues had been informed.
Mrs Shephard was in Wales chairing a meeting of European Community ministers
as the cabinet committee met to agree the closures and was not briefed on
the details until hours later. She will today meet chairmen of 14 English
Tecs, covering mining areas hit by the closures to discuss the extra help.
Speaking on BBC Television yesterday, Mr Heseltine said that there had been
no alternative to the decision to close 31 of British Coal's 50 pits. Mr
Heseltine said he took full responsibility for the difficulties the
government faced over coal mining. But he said that once MPs heard his
statement, a defeat would be averted. 'I think backbenchers will see that
the government is taking very considerable notice of what people are saying
and has presented a range of proposals which meet the enormity of the
difficulties we face.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, joined in a public defence of the
closure decision by ministers, saying that Mr Major had demonstrated the
'leadership' demanded by his critics in taking a harsh but necessary
decision.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Chemists call for right to sell more drugs over the counter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S high street chemists have called for the right to add 51 popular
drugs to the list of products they can sell over the counter without a
doctor's prescription.
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society, which represents and licenses pharmacists,
says the drugs - which include Glaxo's anti-ulcer medicine Zantac, the
world's best-selling drug with annual sales of Pounds 1.6bn - had a proven
track-record of safety.
Its recommendation follows a meeting last week between the Medicines Control
Agency, which licenses drugs in the UK, and industry associations to discuss
speeding-up procedures for switching drugs from prescription to
over-the-counter status.
The drugs include Zantac's arch-rival Tagamet, marketed by SmithKline
Beecham.
Other leading products include Wellcome's best-selling herpes treatment
Zovirax, which has already received OTC licences in Germany and New Zealand,
its antihistamine drug Semprex, Schering-Plough's antihistamine drug
Clarityn and SmithKline's antibiotic ointment Bactro-ban.
Fisons' two asthma treatments, Intal and Tilade, are listed as are Pfizer's
arthritis drug Feldane and the US group's anti-fungal treatment Diflucan.
The recommendations come at a time when governments, anxious to contain
rising health costs, are increasingly keen to switch prescription medicines
which are largely paid for by government into OTC products paid for by
patients.
Companies are keen to switch because they can extend drugs' revenue stream
after their patents expire. In some cases, sales can be multiplied more than
fivefold, although the marketing costs of OTC products are higher than those
of prescription medicines.
A number of pharmaceutical groups are teaming up with consumer products
companies to help them switch their products. These include SmithKline
Beecham with Marion Merrell Dow of the US; Procter &amp; Gamble, America's
leading OTC company, with Syntex of the US; and Johnson &amp; Johnson with
Merck, both of the US. Wellcome has said it is looking for a European OTC
partner.

FT  19 OCT 92 / Survey of Italian Industry (3): Slim-down speeds up - IRI,
now a joint stock company, looks under-capitalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUMBERS, when spelled out in Italian, can produce words of extraordinary
length. In the new statutes of IRI, the state holding which became a joint
stock company in August, you need 83 characters to spell out the registered
capital - nearly one and half lines of text.
But when it comes to figures the L1,873bn capital looks less impressive for
a company whose holdings make up for nearly 5 per cent of Italy's GDP. If it
is to remain the holding company for the largest conglomeration of
industrial and financial interests in the EC, IRI is under-capitalised.
Before its change of status, the annual turnover of IRI companies was almost
L80,000bn; debts stoods at L61,000bn and some L71,000bn was planned in
investments over the next three years. However, the entire Italian public
sector is now under review, and IRI's basic role as the prime promoter and
financier of industrial development, since it was first formed in 1933 under
Mussolini, is set for a thorough transformation.
At one extreme, IRI could simply have the function of managing the sell-off
and break up of its portfolio of holdings, so that eventually it would wind
itself up. At the other end of the scale, IRI could become a slimmed-down
industrial operator with a rationalised portfolio still controlled by the
state. Here, future funding would have to come from borrowing in the market,
sell-offs and stock market floatation, with consequently greater private
sector involvement.
Already the change to a joint stock company, with the Treasury as sole
shareholder, has removed IRI from the direct control of the political
parties. IRI was traditionally beholden to the parties in government and
always dominated by the Christian Democrats. This control was exercised
directly through the appointment of the holding's president and an advisory
board of political appointees. The latter was eliminated in August and,
although the Andreotti government's appointee as president, Mr Franco
Nobili, remains, he is unlikely to stay beyond November, when proposals on
IRI's role are scheduled to be completed.
In the meantime IRI is being run by a small team headed by Mr Michele
Tedeschi, the 52 year-old managing director who has spent his entire career
as a manager in the state sector. Since 1980 he has been with the IRI
management and from 1989 he has been chief executive with specific
responsibility for coordinating the holding's strategy.
He has also been involved in two of the most important areas of IRI
operations: Finmeccanica, the holding which coordinates engineering activity
and high technology, and STET, the telecommunications holding, which
accounts for more than a quarter of IRI's sales.
Mr Tedeschi was responsible for IRI's strategic plan, released in May. The
philosophy behind this was an acceleration of the slimming process, in
evidence over the past decade, in which some 100,000 jobs have been shed -
over a fifth of the workforce. IRI would have sold off by 1995 assets worth
L11,000bn. But these would have been mainly minority interests, although
full sell-offs were mot excluded to rationalise the state presence in
specific sectors.
Earlier this year IRI sold its cement interests in Cementir, which
controlled 10 per cent of the Italian cement market. Also as part of the
strategic plan, IRI's steel subsidiary, Ilva, reduced its involvement in
long products by forming a 40/60 venture with Lucchini, the private steel
group.
IRI management would feel most comfortable following this strategic plan,
becoming in the process an industrial operator. This would also entail
consolidation of the group's involvement in high technology areas and the
extension of international alliances such as Finmeccanica's 45 per cent
stake in France SGS Thomson. Finmeccanica itself is scheduled to float its
shares later this year, making it less directly dependent upon IRI.
A critical issue to be addressed will be the future shape of Finmeccanica.
If IRI is really set to slim down, or even disappear, Finmeccanica could
well form the core of a mixed state-private engineering group or,
alternatively, form the basis of a more coherent state presence in
engineering and high technology.
Finmeccanica had already begun an attempt at rationalising the state
presence in the engineering sector through an agreement in principle with
some of the complementary interests of Efim, the loss-making industrial
state holding. Efim was placed in liquidation in July, overtaking this
outline agreement. Finmeccanica - in the short term at least - may be
obliged to take on some Efim assets. But this in turn could affect
Finmeccanica's floatation.
All this merely emphasises the opportunity now available for a thorough
rationalisation of what had become an ungainly hybrid organisation. The old
holding acted as the umbrella organisation, financier and strategic planner
for an enormous variety of industrial activities, from aerospace, civil
engineering, and electronics, to foodstuffs, information technology,
ship-building, steel and transportation, through to financial services,
banking and control of state television. These different sectors lacked
integration and made little use of synergies.
Subservience of IRI to the politicians has dictated the irrational
accumulation of holdings and loss-making activities in recent years. This
was especially so in the case of investments in the south, which have
latterly been absorbing a third of all investments. Political linkage was
reinforced by the nature of IRI's funding. It had no capital; it had a small
endowment fund - until 1984 it simply received cash handouts from the
government.
Since 1990, as the government cut back on transfers, IRI had been
increasingly obliged to seek ways of raising its own cash and permitting
more of its subsidiaries to seek external funding in the market - although
this practice could only apply to profitable operations such as STET.
Thus IRI's identity was split between politically motivated
investment/financial operations and those determined by the market. This
played havoc with the accounts, with 'cash cows' such as the autostrada
operations and telecommunications on one side, and loss-makers such as
Fincantieri (shipping) and Iritecna (civil engineering) on the other.
IRI will receive a welcome cash injection from last month's government
decision to permit the sale of the holding's 67 per cent stake in Credito
Italiano, the country's sixth largest commercial bank. But the search for
cash will not end here.
This month IRI announced the controversial sale of its stake in Finsiel, its
software holding, to STET for L700bn. The move provoked an outcry from the
stock market, which saw the operation as a crude means of raising cash with
STET paying an excessive price for an asset it did not need. IRI claimed
there was industrial logic behind the deal: telecommunications groups needed
to forge alliances in the expanding services sector.
Despite the polemics, the Finsiel deal underlined that the determining
element in IRI's future will be its own financial health. The burden of debt
is high. The state is pledged to guarantee existing IRI obligations. The
market is unlikely to view kindly any further accumulation without a clear
strategy of sell-offs.

FT  19 OCT 92 / National Savings sales rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES of National Savings products recovered last month after a sharp fall
in August. Net receipts amounted to Pounds 202m, and to Pounds 314m with
accrued interest of Pounds 112m taken into account.
Total contribution to government coffers for the financial year so far is
Pounds 2.7bn, including accrued interest of Pounds 1bn. Last month's
increase follows a fall in receipts in August to Pounds 126m, after a strong
rise in July.
Gross sales of all products amounted to Pounds 656m. The highest net
additions were by fixed-interest savings certificates, which contributed
Pounds 132m, and the first option (Pounds 65m). Index linked certificates
brought in Pounds 42m. The launch of the first option bond in July caused
protest from building societies and, it is widely believed, led the
government to cut its rates on National Savings products.
Interest rates on deposits and income bonds and deposits were further
reduced to 9 per cent gross on September 18. New fixed-interest terms
announced on September 28 included 6.75 per cent on 39th issue savings
certificates and 8.67 per cent gross on first-option bonds. The total amount
invested in National Savings as of the end of September was Pounds 42.5bn.

FT  17 OCT 92 / (CORRECTED) Finance and the Family: Face the truth about
your portfolio - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEAN MILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 20th October 1992) appended to this article.
MISTRUSTFUL of professional advisers, still more so of my own judgment, as
an investor I hold an uneasy course between churning our portfolio to death
and letting it wither away from neglect. I have recently found that a
heavyweight portfolio management computer program can be a powerful aid to
decision-making, although no substitute for it.
By 'heavyweight' I mean a program designed for financial professionals: one
that can handle many portfolios, drawing information (such as prices and
dividend rates) about individual companies from a common pool; that can deal
with a large number of individual shares and store as much data as I might
need about each; that can receive data automatically via telephone lines.
Reports, on the computer screen or printed, can display any selection or
combination of data. Dividend lists, with tax credits, can be produced for a
tax return; so can a statement of indexed capital gains and losses, actual
or unrealised. There will be a wide variety of graphs, simple and
sophisticated. A cash account can be kept with each portfolio.
I tried two widely-advertised programs in this category. Both satisfied the
job description. Synergy's ShareMaster Professional is austere, apparently
meant exclusively for professionals. JSL Software's Fairshares Plus is
friendlier: it is also much the cheaper.
What does such a program have to offer someone like me (roughly, the Little
Old Lady market)? To begin with, I was surprised at how educational using
Fairshares was: to provide the information the program wanted, I had to dig
in annual reports, and pay attention to interim results announced in the
newspapers. That was valuable in itself, and in return Fairshares taught me
more in the way it organised my information and reported it back to me.
Facts too easily glossed over are clearly there to be faced.
A strength of Fairshares is its kindly way of using what it already knows to
interpret and amplify what you are telling it, even as you work. When you
update share prices, the screen immediately shows the percentage rise or
fall in each price or index over one week, two weeks, and eight weeks: and
the intervals can be changed, if you prefer.
Even better: as you enter purchases and sales of a share, the screen shows
the average price you have paid for all the shares in your holding and the
current value of the holding. It also shows the indexed cost of the holding.
It is all too easy for a practised self-deceiver like myself to evaluate the
performance of a long-held share through rose-tinted spectacles. Some of our
old stagers have acquitted themselves nobly. In other cases, the indexed
cost was an eye-opener.
The transaction list was also revealing. We tend to take up rights issues
unless we know the company actually has the bailiffs at the door, and we
often accept shares in lieu of dividends. It is easy to overlook how much we
are putting in to the portfolio in these ways: Fairshares presents an
itemised account of how much we have put in (or taken out) since a chosen
date, with a note of the percentage by which the portfolio has changed in
value over the same period, apart from the additions and subtractions.
Interesting.
Fairshares offers a comprehensive scheme of graphs: of single shares and of
relative strength, of volume traded and of the 'Coppock Index', to mention a
few. There are also bar charts showing the relative weights of the stock
market sectors represented in the portfolio, or of the geographical areas
involved. Capital gains or losses since purchase, and percentage price
changes from any date to any other, can also be shown in order.
Fairshares offers a variety of ready-made reports for printing, with the
option of tailoring others to your own requirements. Furthermore, the
computer's 'print screen' key remains functional in this program, so that
any display can be printed without fuss.
Indeed, I could not think of any question to ask about our portfolio which
Fairshares could not answer.
To keep indexation right, you must add each new figure for the Retail Price
Index as it as announced. You must also type in changes in tax rates and
bands, so that tax credits will be calculated correctly. More fundamental
changes in the rules for calculating capital gains tax would require an
update of the program.
Mistakes are easy to correct, and it is easy to start off with a minimum of
information and fill in more as you go along. The manual is good, and
well-indexed.
My only grumble about Fairshares is that it allows only one classification
of shares. The program assumes you will want to classify shares according to
the sectors of a Financial Times listing, although you can replace those
sectors with anything else you like. I would have preferred to keep the FT
sectors and have another means of tagging shares, so that I could lump the
privatisation shares together, for instance, or consider the performance of
recent acquisitions as a group.
Worth the money? For serious traders, certainly. Not a bad idea, either, for
Little Old Ladies who want to know what's going on.
Fairshares Plus costs Pounds 150, inc VAT, from JSL Software, Hallmark
House, 97 East St, Epsom, Surrey, KT17 1EA; 0372-742526. They offer a
demonstration disk for Pounds 5, deductable from later purchases. Automatic
price updating requires further hardware and software, which JSL supplies.
ShareMaster Professional costs Pounds 595 plus VAT from Synergy Software,
Britannic House, 20 Dunstable Rd, Luton, LU1 1ED; 0582-424282.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Counsel named to probe BNL loans scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM BARR, the US attorney-general, tried yesterday to head off
growing criticism of the Bush administration's alleged involvement in the
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi loans scandal by appointing an
independent counsel to investigate the Justice Department's entire handling
of the case.
However, the move falls significantly short of the formal request made on
Thursday by the Democratic majority of the House judiciary committee that a
special prosecutor be named to handle the BNL issue.
Mr Al Gore, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, on Thursday claimed
the BNL affair and the Bush administration's alleged cover-up was bigger
than the Watergate scandal.
Mr Barr said that Mr Frederick Lacey, a retired judge from New Jersey, would
supervise the preliminary investigation and report back on whether a special
prosecutor should be appointed. Under US law Mr Barr has 30 days to reply to
the congressional demand for a special prosecutor. Mr Barr said the naming
of the 72-year-old Mr Lacey would not preclude the appointment of a special
prosecutor.
Congressional critics said the attorney-general, a close aide to President
Bush, was merely trying to stall until the presidential election had been
held.
Senator David Boren, the conservative Democratic chairman of the Senate
intelligence committee, on Wednesday demanded the appointment of a special
prosecutor after disclosing that the CIA had deliberately concealed
information about BNL from federal prosecutors with the 'strong advice' of
the Justice Department.
Yesterday, Senator Boren reacted to Judge Lacey's appointment by saying
'clearly his appointment is not a satisfactory substitute' for the
appointment of a special prosecutor independent of the Justice Department.
As a result, he said, the Senate intelligence committee would continue to
require sworn depositions from Bush administration officials.
The US attorney-general said he believed allegations of criminal wrongdoing
by members of his department were unfounded and blamed the need to appoint
Mr Lacey on 'media sensationalism'. He said he was 'saddened' by the need to
take the step.
Mr Barr also said he was setting up a special Justice Department task force
to pursue the BNL case, including the prosecution of Mr Christopher Drogoul,
the former BNL Atlanta branch manager who was accused of single-handedly
orchestrating Dollars 5bn of illegal Iraqi loans. More than Dollars 2bn of
these helped fund weapons projects.
The task force, to be supervised by a Justice Department prosecutor, would
also investigate the possible complicity of executives in BNL's head office
in Rome.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Shift of ownership likely at C&amp;J Clark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GLASTONBURY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
C&amp;J CLARK, the footwear manufacturer and one of Britain's largest private
companies, is not likely to remain a family-run business for much longer.
After 167 years of family control, the consensus which emerged at
yesterday's emotional extraordinary meeting was that only a change in
ownership could end decades of family feuding, writes Peggy Hollinger in
Glastonbury.
That was about the only point on which the board unanimously agreed during
the 90-minute meeting, with the differences in opinion only too obvious.
The EGM had been called by four directors members, who proposed to replace
Mr Walter Dickson, the chairman, and Mr James Power, a non-executive
director. The rebels claimed a disagreement over corporate strategy and
aimed to increase family influence on the board.
The proposals were never put to the vote, however, as shareholders voted
unanimously to adjourn the meeting until after the annual meeting in April.
The adjournment was part of a last-minute compromise agreed late on Thursday
afternoon.
The deal included the creation of a committee to review possible bids for
Clark's, and to target a price which could be recommended by the board.
Between 300 and 400 angry shareholders packed the modest town hall in
Glastonbury, Somerset. There were sharp rebukes for the feuding which, in
the words of one investor and former employee, had made Clark's 'the
laughing-stock of the industry'.
But shareholders reserved their fiercest criticisms for the 'Gang of Four'
who had called the meeting. Mr David Edwards, a shareholder and friend of
the family, called on Mr Lance Clark - leader of the rebels - to 'consider
his position' before the annual meeting.
His call received an almost deafening round of applause.
Mr Clark leapt to the defence of the rebels, saying he felt it would have
been irresponsible to 'sit and watch' as profits steadily declined.
The adjournment has merely postponed the dispute. The resolution to oust the
two directors will be put to the vote in April, unless the rebels decide to
withdraw. They have refused to comment.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Family footsteps fade as Street faces
changes - Peggy Hollinger on a new future for an old firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL Somerset village of Street knew change was in the air when the
Bear Hotel finally got its licence to sell alcohol five years ago.
The Clark family, Quaker guardians of Britain's biggest shoe manufacturer
C&amp;J Clark, had long been divided over the issue.
The place had been dry since 1883 when William Clark, son of the Quaker
founder, bought the pub facing the original factory and converted it into a
coffee house. It was done, he said, in the interests of his employees' moral
welfare.
In the end, some of the current generation including William's great
grandson, Mr John Clothier, won the licence through sheer persistence.
The licence fight was only a small skirmish in a widening break with the
past. Since then, a rapidly growing number of family members have become
willing to change with the times, and to yield control of the company they
have run in distinctive Quaker style for 167 years.
The only problem is, family animosity is still running high and some members
do not trust others to handle the transition to best advantage.
Mr Clothier, managing director, is one of the new breed willing to back
outsiders. A fast-talking, brusque man, he appears determined not to let
emotion cloud business - unless someone criticises the quality of Clark
shoes.
He is also the first Clark running the business not to have come from the
manufacturing division. Mr Clothier was weaned on retail, which Clark's
entered for the first time seriously in the 1970s.
Mr Clothier is not alone in his pragmatic approach. For the vast majority of
Clarks, their sole links with the company are share certificates and the
welcome dividend income.
As times have become more difficult, many have been frustrated by their
inability to cash in their shares. The matter has become more urgent with
the prospect of a severe downturn. Many received a rude shock this summer
when profits slumped. The board cut the payout and said it could no longer
guarantee dividend growth.
To some extent, the changes are being forced on the family by external
factors: Clark's vast expansion in the 1950s and 60s; and the harsh
environment which has crippled the UK shoe industry in recent years.
Both call for ruthless business skills and vast amounts of cash. The company
also found itself stretched financially following its buy-back of Pounds 40m
of family shares two years ago.
But many in Clark's and the community pin the changes on the family's
alienation from its roots in Street. For the first time in Clark's history,
the 11 board members live around the country. According to one employee:
'That is the difference from the generation which ran Clark's in the 1960s.
The family is split geographically and emotionally.'
The locals in Street find it difficult to come to terms with the current
generation of Clarks. For years, Streetonians regarded the family as their
own and factory work as their right. Now they never see the family and the
jobs are no longer there.
The recent closure of the company's last shoe factory in the town where it
all began was felt by many to be unforgiveable. The once proudly-quoted
phrase 'Clark's made Street and Street made Clark's' is now uttered with the
bitterness of the betrayed.
Local officials, meanwhile, fear the closure could foreshadow Clark's
abandonment of Street. Their anxieties have been amplified by talk of a
sale. The company is still one of the area's largest employers with 1,000
people working in its Street headquarters.
The village was little more than a stagecoach stop, reknowned only for
drunkenness, when Cyrus and James Clark began making slippers in 1825. Today
it boasts 9,000 souls, several schools, two swimming pools, a theatre, a
college and a library. Most of these have been funded by the Clark family.
The present day management is still proud of its commitment to the community
and its workers. Through a trust fund, Clark's contributes more than Pounds
1m a year to various projects and the subsidised canteen at the headquarters
is open to pensioners in search of a warm, cheap meal.
Such gestures are not likely to change under the current Clark's management,
which puts a high value on the company's traditions. Whether they would
survive a change of ownership is another question.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: RHM/Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is peculiar that RHM managed a gain of only 2 per cent yesterday after
announcing a demerger designed to unlock shareholder value from its brands.
If there were that much value to be unlocked, then presumably the shares
would have risen much more. The company's supporters may argue that the
small rise reflected profit-taking by speculators who are not prepared to
hold on for a long ride. Maybe there is also now less risk of the shares
falling back towards last month's low of 135p if Hanson walks away. But the
decision to unbundle is a tacit admission that there is little prospect of a
rival bid for the group as a whole. It does not put Hanson under any
particular pressure.
RHM was always going to have to make some effort to persuade Hanson to
increase its 220p offer. Demergers can sometimes tip the balance against a
bid - as was the case with last year's Williams' bid for Racal - but it is
unlikely to do so in this case. The theory is that existing shareholders
rather than Hanson would benefit from the valuation premium on change of
control. But the demerger plan is still only in outline form. Who knows what
the individual companies will be worth once it is complete?
One cannot judge all brands by the 25 times multiple Philip Morris is paying
for Freia Marabou or the 23 times Campbells Soup is offering for Arnotts of
Australia. RHM does own a few strong names such as Sharwood's, but most are
national brands. Many have seen better days. It is hard to imagine Bisto or
Atora suet taking the European single market by storm. Unless buyers are
found for the demerged units, the brands will be managed by the same people
who have been in charge so far. Hanson may well have to increase its offer
but not by much before it will pay shareholders to take the cash and run.

FT  17 OCT 92 / International Company News: Two Japanese regional banks
agree to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Japanese regional banks, Ugo Bank and Akita Akebono Bank, both based in
the north-east, yesterday announced an agreement to merge in a move
applauded by the Ministry of Finance and likely to be repeated in other
parts of the country.
Japan's regional banks have come under increasing pressure with the gradual
liberalisation of financial markets, while individual banks are reeling from
ill-advised stock purchases or lending during the 'bubble era' of the late
1980s.
Both of these elements appear to be at work in the merger of Ugo and Akita
Akebono, as the latter bank reported a 98 per cent fall in pre-tax profit in
the year ended March. The bank has admitted that its earnings were weighed
down by huge appraisal losses on securities holdings.
Ugo Bank, capitalised at Y3.15bn (Dollars 26.25m) at end-March, has 71
branches, most in the Akita region and had a balance of deposits of Y621.3bn
at the fiscal year-end. Akita Akebono, a former 'sogo' or mutual bank, had a
capital of Y2.37bn, and deposits of Y403.2bn in its 60 branches.
Executives of the two banks said yesterday that the new name is yet to be
decided, although Ugo will be the more influential of the partners. The
president and chairman of Ugo Bank are likely to retain those positions,
while the president of Akita Akebono is expected to be vice-chairman when
the merger is formally carried out next April.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, welcomed the merger and said the
country's banks must intensify efforts to streamline operations. He said
mergers should be considered as one means of improving efficiency among
smaller banks.
The Regional Banks Association of Japan also applauded the announcement, and
suggested that the merger was a 'way to increase customer services under
increasingly tough management conditions'.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: FT Quarterly Review of Personal Finance - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Five years ago on Monday, the world's stock markets collapsed. It was
perhaps the day when the 1980s free-market dream turned sour. Could it all
happen again? Now that the world economy has gone through its recent
traumas, the crash of '87 can be reassessed. Its causes, its place in
economic history and the lessons to be drawn from it receive special
attention in the autumn issue of the FT Quarterly Review of Personal
Finance, to be published with next Friday's paper and repeated with
Saturday's. The Review also includes a survey on Unit Trusts.

Leeds Permanent building society was quick to react to yesterday's base rate
cut, not with a mortgage rate cut of its own but with the introduction of a
new fixed rate mortgage.
The fixed rate is 7.95 per cent for a two year period and replaces the 8.75
per cent fixed rate which was launched last week. The minimum loan is Pounds
15,005 and there is no maximum advance. The mortgage is available on all
types of mortgages with an arrangement fee of Pounds 150. There is a
redemption fee of two months' interest in the first year and one month in
the second year. See Page IV

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Contributions to investment trust savings schemes fell by 24 per cent
between the second and third quarters of 1992. This was largely due to a
drop in lump sum investment, although there was a small fall in the amount
invested on a regular basis. However, the number of regular savings accounts
increased from 57,280 to 66,475. Nearly Pounds 400m has been invested in IT
savings schemes since they began in 1984.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Markets: Peps prove popular . . . - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
New figures for the amount invested in personal equity plans show that
Pounds 2.26bn was invested in Peps for the 1991-92 tax year, with more than
640,000 new general plans taken out.
This is a rise of Pounds 660m from the previous year, when the amount
invested was Pounds 1.6bn. The increase was caused in large part by new
investment trust launches, which allowed the full annual limit of Pounds
6,000 to be put into a Pep. Changes announced in the Budget this year lifted
the Pounds 3,000 limit on unit and investment trusts.
The Treasury also attributed last year's rise in investments to the
introduction of single company Peps. The total invested in general Peps
since their introduction in 1987 now amounts to more than Pounds 6bn.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Domestic gales ruffle Major's EC
outing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European summit was nearly hijacked by British domestic political
problems as the embattled Mr John Major, the British Prime Minister, was
caught up in a storm of journalists' questions on the government's mine
closure programme and the cut in interest rates.
The overriding interest shown by the press in the political crisis facing Mr
Major forced Downing Street officials to take the unprecedented step of
holding two consecutive press conferences - the first on the summit
discussions and the second on British problems.
That neat division was not respected by Mr Major himself, however, as he
fought to establish a clear link between Britain's economic and financial
problems and the 'body blow' to confidence delivered to the whole Community
by events such as the Danish electorate's rejection of the Maastricht treaty
and the bare majority in favour of the treaty in the French referendum.
'It was, above all, confidence that we needed to restore,' Mr Major said.
The implication was that Britain's withdrawal from the exchange rate
mechanism could be attributed to much wider causes than any policy mistakes
the government might have made. But if Mr Major was not averse to invoking
the political and economic 'turbulence' of the past few months as the reason
for Britain's woes, he was equally anxious to show that the UK's future
prosperity was dependent on the Community and the controversial Maastricht
treaty.
'The European Community is vital for our prosperity, our economy and our
jobs,' he said. Some 60 per cent of Britain's trade was with the EC, half
the visible investment in Britain came from the Community and eight of
Britain's top trade partners were members of the EC.
Moreover, the European Single Market, due to be completed by the end of this
year, would boost the Community's GDP by 5 per cent and a successful
conclusion of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations would add an extra
Dollars 200bn in EC member states' wealth every 10 years. The fact that
French ministers made it clear yesterday that an agreement was still far off
was ignored by Mr Major, who said that much more progress had been made
during the last round of negotiations than had been reported.
The Prime Minister also did his best to scotch reports that a hard core of
EC countries led by Germany, and including the Benelux countries, were
starting to talk of a 'two-speed' Europe, in which they would go ahead with
a monetary union according to the timetable laid down in the Maastricht
treaty, while weaker economies such as Britain and Italy would take a much
slower lane.
'A common theme in all the interventions at the conference was that we
should all move together and that there should be no fast or slow track,'
the prime minister said. Meanwhile German and other officials said privately
that yesterday's British interest rate cut could only increase the prospect
of a two-speed EC.
No one could deny that the Birmingham Declaration on making the Community
more open, respecting the national identities of the member countries and
involving national parliaments more closely in the Community's activities,
was a success for Mr Majorin his quest for public and parliamentary support
for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. But it was no more than a
consolation prize for the buffeting he has received throughout the day on
his domestic policies.

FT  17 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Give treaty human face, says Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major urged his EC partners yesterday to give the Maastricht treaty
a 'human face' to make it more acceptable to the citizens of the Community.
The British prime minister said the aim of the summit was to put an end to
the political and economic turbulence of the past few months, which had sown
serious doubts in people's minds about future European integration.
The rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danish people in last June's
referendum and the close result in last month's French referendum indicated
deep and widespread concern about the treaty. The recent turbulence on the
foreign exchange markets had fuelled these worries.
'We must send a clear signal to the citizens of Europe that we will listen
to their worries and respond to their needs,' Mr Major said. 'We have to
convince them that the process of European construction is in the interests
of all of us, despite the sacrifices it will sometimes require.'
If the member governments failed to demonstrate to their citizens that their
concerns were unfounded, then the Community must be prepared to change its
ways and adapt to meet those concerns.
'Unless we have the people with us, our enterprise will not succeed.'
Mr Major said that a clear declaration of political intent was required from
the present meeting to reassure people that the Community would preserve
national identities and the role of national parliaments, as well as
becoming more democratic and open.
Among the steps proposed to achieve these aims are closer consultation
between the Commission and member states, encouraging national parliaments
to become more involved in Community affairs and thus to act as a bridge
between the Brussels bureaucracy and its citizens, and providing more
information to the public about the Community's activities.

FT  17 OCT 92 / UK Mining Closures: Cabinet version of events revised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWNING Street yesterday sought to salvage something from the public
relations wreckage surrounding this week's pits closure announcement by
insisting that most members of the cabinet had been informed before the
decision was made public.
Delivering the third version in as many days of the precise mechanics of the
decision, officials said Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
had forewarned colleagues of the announcement at a cabinet committee meeting
on Tuesday morning.
The committee - on overseas policy and defence - had been attended by all
but four cabinet ministers. Those absent were Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health
secretary, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, Lord Chancellor, Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, and Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary.
Downing Street said Mr Heseltine had informed the group that the
announcement - originally planned for next week - was being brought forward
at the request of British Coal to end uncertainty.
The officials stressed also that a number of senior ministers - including Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary - had
been involved for several weeks in talks with Mr John Major, the prime
minister, and Mr Heseltine on the scale of the closures. Others such as Mr
Peter Lilley, social services secretary, had been brought in to the
discussions at various points.
But the explanation, which followed days of confusion as to why Thursday's
cabinet meeting had been asked merely to rubber stamp such an important
decision, failed to dispel disquiet among some ministers about the apparent
ability of British Coal to 'bounce' Mr Heseltine into an early announcement.

FT  17 OCT 92 / No switch for Italian television channels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government has decided to leave unchanged for another year the
structure of the television industry, split among the three state-controlled
channels of RAI TV and the private concessions dominated by Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest media group.
The decision will allow time for a more measured assessment of the role of
state television at a time of extreme financial uncertainty and political
change.
The RAI is owned by IRI, the state holding company which in August became a
joint stock company owned by the Treasury. This move has thrown into doubt
both IRI's continued ownership of the RAI and its funding base. Some
deputies are calling for the winding up of RAI or at least the sale of two
channels.
These changes, combined with the discredited overt political control of the
state television, are forcing a redefinition of the RAI's role. Until now
RAI Uno, the main state channel, has been run by the Christian Democrats,
RAI Due by the Socialists and RAI Tre by the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left.
The structure reflected a wholly different political picture when the
Christian Democrats and Socialists dominated the levers of institutional
power and the communists were the party of opposition.
The April general elections and the corruption scandals of the past nine
months have undermined the authority of the traditional parties. There is
also a move for change from within RAI. In the past month RAI Uno
journalists have passed a vote of no confidence against Mr Bruno Vespa, the
Christian Democrat director of news.
This week the Amato government has put the squeeze on RAI by refusing
requests for an increase in licence fees and the amount of time available
for advertising slots.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Gucciesque style on a budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE THING you do not need to achieve the sleek, Gucciesque,
town-into-country style is an Italian textile magnate's budget. So ingrained
has this look become in global fashion that it has been copied, sometimes
unwittingly, by every chain store in the UK.
It is rarely presented in shops as a total look. It is up to you to pull the
ingredients together. So, to help you search through those forbidding rails,
here are a few rules:
Start by deciding on a colour scheme, because the point of this style is
that everything should blend smoothly. Stick to warm-toned and less obvious
shades: they look more opulent than cooler neutral.
Decide how to layer your outfit. A simple, boxy, easy-cut short coat works
for either sex, perhaps edge-to-edge or a parka for a woman, a duffle or pea
jacket for a man. Fabric should be a soft-textured, wool mix - even a little
cashmere content can be reasonably priced - or a muted check.
Under this can go toning knitwear in the same understated but elegant mood,
perhaps with a plain cotton shirt as a base. You can make the look more
formal by replacing the knit with a tailored jacket.
Armed with this plan you can track down the crucial pieces. Marks and
Spencer has excellent plain knitwear and wool moufflon or flannel jackets
for both sexes. Benetton has a range of knitwear and wool separates in pale,
warm shades.
British Home Stores has upgraded its styling and has men's wool moufflon
jackets at Pounds 65, soft pale parkas at Pounds 69.99 and a range of
knitwear. River Island has good soft-cut trouser suits and a plain,
rich-looking parka at Pounds 59.95.
For a younger version, Dorothy Perkins covers the field, from a blonde fake
fur duffle coat at Pounds 125 to a muted plaid jacket at Pounds 59.99.
Equally casual, Littlewoods' men's bargain prices include suede waistcoats
at Pounds 24.99 and check shirts at Pounds 9.99. And the finishing Italian
touch - the penny loafer or lace-up boatshoe - is widely available, for
example from Asda at Pounds 24.99.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Italian men do it in style . . .: Avril Groom on UK dress
inhibitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM

<TEXT>
THERE USED to be rules, mainly recognised by men of a certain social class,
about town and country clothes. 'Never wear brown in town' was the flip
aphorism that covered a multitude of regulations so rigid that a Victorian
gentleman would not dream of leaving his rural seat far London in a city
suit.
Instead, he travelled in his country colours straight to his club, where he
donned a sober frockcoat for business, then perhaps a new-fangled suit for
social calling and finally evening clothes for dinner. But this monochrome
ritual never crossed the Channel: Continentals and Americans were not so
inhibited in their dress and this, coupled with a large pinch of jingoism,
made the man in the brown suit a model of untrustworthiness.
There is still a hangover from this attitude. Upmarket menswear companies
which sell both In the UK and in Europe find the proportions of suits to
smart sports jackets they sell reversed between London and Milan. Italian
boardrooms are full of men in subtly-checked sport coats worn with crisply
cufflinked shirts and smart loafers, and they feel themselves the equal of
any dour grey suit. Woman also have their own image of what constitutes the
working wardrobe: brown is OK, but it is never as chic as black or grey.
It all goes back, says Robert Gieves, whose family firm Gieves and Hawkes
have dressed officers and gentlemen for 200 years, to Beau Brummell in the
late 18th century. 'He is thought of as a dandy but in fact he advocated
very sober, rigorous dress,' says Gieves.
'Perfect cutting and the best fabrics were set off by very simple designs in
dark colours. It was a reaction among courtiers in the UK to the foppish
dress of the French court, disgraced after the Revolution.'
So it was Britain which first established the basic principles of good
fashion design and then, sadly, lost them in a welter of petty Victorian
restrictions. Now the more cheerful European view is rubbing off on the UK.
Firms such as Gieves and Hawkes, Burberry and, for woman, Austin Reed
International or Ballantyne, whose first priority is the export trade, find
the rich palette of autumnal shades which we think of as countrified now
sells well in slightly more formal guise in the UK, too.
Not yet in the boardroom but certainly for smart town weekends, the colours
which tone with that continental favourite, loden, are in the ascendant,
though you should choose with care. The khaki/brown/beige spectrum and the
hacking jacket really need the country, and look as out of place in town as
the yuppie cliche of a wax jacket over a city suit. The secret is to build
up simple, toning layers in warm shades which might have come from a spice
rack - curry, saffron, mustard, cinnamon and sage. Woman can add a dash of
paler coral, mint or duck egg.
Anyone can go down a notch or two in formality by adding a little denim,
suede or rugged backwoods checks for the faintly American 'call of the wild'
look that ironically seems now to have invaded most casual urban fashion.
This practical, comfortable, warm autumn style can be put together from any
level of the market, but for a lesson in how to do it, take a look at Hermes
or Gucci. From their lofty European peak, they have decades of experience in
effortlessly seaming town with country clothes. And you really cannot see
the join.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Private View: The modest face of heroism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN 36 old soldiers dine tonight to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the
battle of Alamein, they will doubtless be transported back to the smoke and
roar of the desert campaign. But does war change a man's whole life?
Among the Rifle Brigade veterans at dinner in Winchester will be Tom Bird, a
retired architect. Four times wounded and three times decorated, he survived
an extraordinary incident during Alamein which the regimental historian has
called 'the most famous of our war.'
The battle at 'Snipe' began with a tricky advance to Kidney Ridge on the
night of October 26 1942. When dawn broke, the 300 men of the 2nd battalion
Rifle Brigade, plus a detachment of Gunners, found themselves with their 19
anti-tank guns and 22 bren carriers in a shallow depression, an enemy dump
occupied by corpses, excrement and flies. They were in the wrong place, too
far forward and virtually surrounded.
From dawn till dusk, with nothing to eat and little to drink, the sleepless
riflemen and gunners were attacked by wave after wave of German and Italian
tanks. Twice during the day they were mistaken for the enemy and mercilessly
shelled by their own side.
They shot 16 tanks before breakfast, and morale was lifted further when a
sergeant hit another at over 1000 yards. But, as the day wore on, the battle
became frantic: men and officers were jumping to the guns to replace the
dead and wounded and ferrying ammunition under terrible enemy fire. At
times, tanks outnumbered guns by 10 to one and were being stopped in their
tracks only yards from the muzzles.
When they were finally able to withdraw at 11.15pm, with one gun in tow, the
defenders of Snipe had lost 70 men killed or wounded. But they had destroyed
or disabled 60 enemy tanks and guns and broken the back of Rommel's
counter-attack. Such was the devastation, a special committee was appointed
to check the score.
The fame of the battle spread quickly. The battalion commander, Lt Col
Victor Turner, badly wounded in the head while acting as a loader, was
awarded the Victoria Cross. Tom Bird, commander of the anti-tank company and
also wounded in the head, won the DSO. Four other officers and 11 men were
decorated.
It was not the first of Bird's exploits. In January 1941, he had been sent
with a carrier platoon to create a diversion behind Italian-occupied Tobruk.
Finding modest resistance behind the wire, he pressed on through the
defences, capturing 2,000 prisoners and 49 guns. He won the Military Cross.
At Sidi Rezegh in November, he was wounded in the ankle. The next year, he
led a night raid on the Italian lines at Gebel Khalakh. Crossing 2,700 yards
of moonlit desert under fire, he captured a dozen prisoners and an anti-tank
gun with the loss of only one man. He was given a bar to his MC. He was not
decorated, however, for getting a supply convoy into - and out of - a
besieged Free French garrison at Bir Hacheim, nor for his frequent night
patrols behind enemy lines.
I asked Bird if he had known in advance how he would behave under fire.
'No, I don't think you do know. It's rather a relief to find, however
frightened you are, that you can appear reasonably calm. Creeping around
behind the enemy lines in the middle of the night I found far more
frightening, really, than trying to remain calm under attack.'
Did you think Snipe was your last day on earth?
He laughed. 'I think probably, yes. No, you never really think that. It did
appear we were being fired at all day from every direction. At the end I
looked upon it in a rather different light than people do now. My second in
command, Hugo Salmon, had been killed. Four of my officers and I had been
wounded and we'd lost all our guns. So it didn't seem like much of a
victory.'
Because of his wounds, and through a family friendship, the young major was
appointed ADC to General Wavell, now commander-in-chief, Far East, in Delhi.
Leaving behind the heat, sand and flies, he found himself in a house with
113 servants. 'But I found the change not difficult to adjust to.' He
smiled. 'Within a week or so, you were just rather indignant if your martini
wasn't ready when you wanted it.'
After briefly rejoining the battalion to command a dash to Beirut to quell a
riot, Bird was given home leave. His father, who had been seriously wounded
in both legs at Gallipoli in the first war, was ill. The son became an
infantry instructor at Barnard Castle, Yorkshire. But after seven months,
and with the army now in northern Europe, Bird felt he should be fighting
again.
He joined the 8th battalion on the Albert Canal in Belgium. Two days later,
driving through a village under heavy fire, he got out of his vehicle to
help a wounded bren gunner. He was instantly pierced through the back, chest
and leg by a shrapnel burst. Rescued under cover of a smokescreen, he joined
the critical list.
Bird was lucky. He ended the war as ADC to Field-Marshal 'Jumbo' Wilson at
the British mission in Washington. There he fell in love with Alice
Hunsaker, daughter of a distinguished Bostonian aeronautical engineer, and
married her.
Gentle humour, not heroics, is what distinguishes Tom Bird. He is a man
whose eyes seem always alight; when his voice slows and tails off, it is a
sure sign that a joke is coming up. But there is nothing artificial about
his singular brand of humorous understatement.
As a Winchester schoolboy (many Rifle Brigade officers were there or at
Eton, as most of the men were from London's East End), he learned to draw
and thought of becoming a painter. He seemed to take after his uncle
Kenneth, nom de plume 'Fougasse,' the cartoonist and former editor of Punch.
But he also opened the batting for his school cricket team. 'I suppose my
Walter Mitty dream would be to open the innings for England against
Australia,' he said slowly. 'At Lord's' He went climbing and skiing in the
Swiss Alps. 'It was supposed to be about 'the majesty of the mountains' and
so on. But I think there is no doubt that what I enjoyed was taking the
risks.'
After school he studied architecture in London, joining the Rifle Brigade
reserves because he was convinced after Munich that war was imminent and his
father advised him it was best to sign up early. His elder brother, Edward,
had chosen the same regiment. But Edward was killed at Calais early in the
war. Tom was in the desert when he heard.
'You asked what changed my life most,' he said. 'I think my brother being
killed changed my life the most. We did everything together. I hadn't been
able to imagine life without him . . . I think for a time after that I
didn't mind too much what happened to me, either.'
After the war, Bird went back to architectural school; he described how the
student-colonels would intimidate the lecturers from the front row. Then he
went into partnership with another young architect, Richard Tyler, a sapper
who had lost a leg at the battle of Sidi Rezegh and whom he had met in
Heliopolis hospital near Cairo.
I asked Bird if peace had come as an anti-climax after wartime celebrity.
'Snipe wasn't that famous then. It has become famous in a way because it was
the turning point of Alamein, which has been regarded as the turning point
of the war. But I didn't suffer from being a celebrity, I can assure you of
that.'
He likes talking about the war and has felt more free to do so as he has got
older. (He is now a very fit-looking 74). 'I remembered about old soldiers
binding on about the war. So I hope I don't. It helps to have a wife with a
different background - who was not brought up as a Wykehamist.' He laughed.
'And then to have children who don't mind what they say to you. I hope they
have prevented me from becoming too pompous.
'Nonetheless, even now, I suppose most of my most interesting experiences
were during the war. Therefore, when I reminisce it tends to be about them.'
Bird has two sons, Tony and Nicky, and a daughter, Sarah. I asked: do your
sons feel they missed something?
'I should be very surprised indeed if they thought that.'
Do you think they missed something?
'No. They missed an experience, but there are lots of other experiences.'
Were you never tempted to criticise the peacetime generation?
'That is not how I felt, no. One of the things I'm grateful for is that,
when it came to the point, most of us didn't have any trouble in deciding it
was a war worth fighting. But I don't think we felt that entitled us to have
any particular views about what the next generation should do . . . or I
certainly didn't'
Was the war the high point?
'No, I think I have been very fortunate in my life. I had a job which I
enjoyed doing, a partner with whom I got on very well, and a wife and family
with whom I continue to have a lot of fun.
'There were things I told myself during the war: I'll never go camping
again, I'll never get up before dawn again, and I'm absolutely never going
to put on a white tie and a boiled shirt again. I remember promising myself,
even during Snipe: If I live through today, I shall never, never go to a
dance again.
'But it isn't true of, course, because since then I have rather enjoyed
going camping and enjoyed seeing the dawn - though I certainly haven't
enjoyed going to dances.'
Do war veterans share a secret incomprehensible to the rest of us?
'Well, they are probably among my best friends, and we do have a nice time
together.'
But is your experience incommunicable?
'I doubt it. I suppose if you have been on an adventure, then that adventure
will always be special to those people, like a party climbing Kanchenjunga.
But it wouldn't have to be a war.
'Mostly, we did what we were told. I just happened to be somewhere where I
did what I was told. And it just happened I was told to do something rather
unpleasant and risky. But I don't think I went far beyond the call of duty,
which I think Vic Turner did. He always had to be in the middle of
absolutely everything.'
What about the feeling of having done one's bit: that you have earned that
extra bottle of wine at dinner?
He laughed. 'No, that's not why I have the extra bottle of wine. I don't
feel that I have deserved anything special. It was just something that
happened in my time.'

FT  17 OCT 92 / Suddenly, it's the S-word: Dominic Lawson wonders if there
hasn't been some economic over-reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON

<TEXT>
THIS YEAR'S US presidential election is notable for what has not been said,
rather than what has passed the lips, read or otherwise, of the candidates.
In particular, no one, so far as I am aware, has asked of any of the
contenders: 'Will it be safe if his finger is on the button?'
As older readers than I will remember, it was that question which ditched
Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign back in 1964. Voters had a genuine
fear of being blown to smithereens, or something even messier, in a nuclear
holocaust. But no one even talks about fingers on nuclear buttons these
days. The greatest of all our fears has ended with the cold war.
And yet, human nature being what it is, we are no happier, no more relaxed.
Indeed, recent polls of American opinion, for what such polls are worth,
suggest that peace between the superpowers has not increased one iota the
happiness of those formerly in the firing line.
What seems to happen, in fact, is that we experience a roughly constant
level of panic and stress which we attribute not to our own neuroses but to
whatever external factor seems to be the most distressing to us. In the
cossetted west, this leads us into an absurd misuse of language.
You may recall the newspapers and television programmes at the time of Black
Wednesday. Even the non-tabloid papers used words such as 'catastrophe ' and
'disaster' and 'nightmare.'
Normally sober-suited men from the Bank of England described the occasion as
the 'national day of humiliation.'
Yet, all that had happened was that the pound had been forced to find its
own level against the D-mark - not by any means an unprecedented, or
unfamiliar, or even damaging state of affairs.
At about that time, I took out to lunch someone who had recently spent a
number of years in eastern Europe. She could not understand the angst of the
British press, expressed in such hysterical form.
'If you use words like these to describe what has happened on the foreign
exchange market, what words will be left for you to employ when you
experience a real disaster?' she asked.
'In Poland, we have just endured a 40 per cent drop in industrial output.
What word would an Englishman use to describe that, if it happened here?'
Now, following the announcement of 30,000 redundancies in the coalfields,
the commentators are wheeling out the S-word. What will they say if we
really do enter a slump? Clearly, a new word will have to be invented.
For the time being, headline writers talk of 'male unemployment reaching
levels not seen since 1930s.' Yes; but, as in all things, it is proportions
that count.
Male unemployment is now about 10 per cent of the workforce. In 1932, the
figure was 23 per cent. In the past 20 years, the British labour force has
grown by 3.2m. Ninety per cent of those new jobs went to women. The
two-income family, almost unknown in the 1930s, is now a commonplace, with
all the added security that it brings.
There is, however, an awful danger that the hysterically gloomy
prognostications of the pundits will bring about precisely the dire state of
affairs which they fantasise about. If people believe what they read in the
newspapers, or are influenced subliminally by them, then certain things
inevitably will follow.
Items of domestic spending, which could be afforded easily, will be
postponed. Businessmen thinking of taking on new staff will, instead, start
to wonder if they shouldn't actually be laying off workers.
One of the less attractive aspects of a market economy is the stampede
factor. When one businessman moos and runs for cover, others lower their
horns and head for the same hills. To mix the metaphor still further, we can
observe that there are rather too many people about who enjoy shouting
'Fire' in a crowded theatre.
Such people often forget a minor detail: that they are as likely as anyone
else to get crushed in the ensuing rush for the sign marked Exit. Unlike the
man with his finger on that old-fashioned nuclear button: he, at least, had
his own personal bunker.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's spiralling descent into impotence and despair so wrecked my week
that I resorted to reading advertisements as a way of escaping through the
looking glass into a secure and prosperous world of cheerfulness and
optimism. But the shock I got was twice as traumatic as anything being
recounted in the news columns or bulletins.
I like advertisements. I am chic enough to call them adverts. And I like the
glossy folk who work in advertising agencies. In the past, many a
shot-riddled grouse did I knife into while lunching with the chairmen or the
creative directors of London's hottest agencies. (I avoided the media
directors, who purchase time and space; they are sweaty and aggressive and
are often sick on the carpet).
The advert that sent my spirits plunging was a newspaper ad for Mercedes.
There was a headline: 'One day you will own a Mercedes. Why wait?' And it
was written in those short, zingy, hairy-chested paragraphs that are
deceptively easy to imitate but which require - take my word - the skills of
a punk-tonsured, bejewelled and ear-ringed copywriter who lives in an
Elizabethan watermill, owns a helicopter and is attended, at every twist and
turn of his 28-year-old life, by flunkies and catwalk creatures of
unsurpassed exoticness.
It started:
Some of you out there have told us you want a Mercedes.
But not just now.
'Chance would be a fine thing,' you mutter.
Or, more to the point, 'I can't afford one at the moment.
You might even remark, 'I'm not old enough yet.'
What have we done to deserve such back-handed compliments?
Has our reputation for the highest quality also given us a reputation for
the highest prices?
There was more in like vein, with all the right trigger-words: reliability,
durability, high resale value, safety, crumple zones, ABS brakes, unique. We
were told there are 36 models of Mercedes to choose from, and that current
UK prices range from Pounds 16,830 to Pounds 88,300 (plus delivery). But
then the advert got serious. Its cleverness overflowed. I was plunged into
melancholy.
It doesn't take much to plunge me into melancholy. What did it this time
were these three paragraphs:
No wonder that over 80 per cent of people who buy a Mercedes go on to buy
another. They understand the difference between price and value.
So if you want a Mercedes, wait no more.
Our cars can last for such a long time (there's one in the Guinness Book of
Records with a million miles on the clock) that if you wait too long, you
may never get the chance to enjoy your second one.
At present, I drive a Rover 216S. The Rover is a British-built car. I like
my Rover. Because it has 2,127 of the recognised 2,128 design faults
expected in a British car, I have promised it to the Science Museum, which
is understandably thrilled.
The reason I bought a Rover in the first place is because I am one of those
people who imagined, wistfully, that whatever Laurel and Hardy did to wreck
the economy, their efforts would be thwarted, or at any rate delayed, by
those of us eccentric enough to buy British products.
A year ago, however, I decided that when the time was ripe and the Rover had
gone to the Science Museum, I would sell a painting or two, cash in some
options, denude my portfolio of several of its Premium Bonds, instruct Miss
Lee, my executive assistant, to stop buying bloody Chanel and purchase a
Merc. Only a little one, though I imagined it would have a telephone.
Then I read Mercedes' advert, and that boracic reference to people who may
never enjoy a second one. They were talking about me. I will never enjoy a
second one.
Then a worse thought occured: I may never enjoy a first one, for times are
truly dire. I do not mean Laurel and Hardy. I mean everything around. In the
view of Alan Greenspan, most of the world is confronting a bout of severe
asset deflation which policymakers have little or no chance of correcting,
heralding a recession whose like we have not known and whose possible
duration means I will never own a Mercedes.
Time is whizzing by. If I live to 65, I will see 18 more springs - an
unbearably finite number - 18 more autumns, 18 more Epsom Derbies and 18
more Christmas trees decorated by Miss Lee from her beautiful collection of
trimmings and lights.
Ashes to ashes. What an amazing piece of copywriting.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Despatches: Whites face a coloured future - Franschhoe /
Patti Waldmeir feels the winds of change in a South African town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KAREL PEPLER stands unsmiling behind the counter of his immaculate butcher
shop in the pristine white town of Franschhoek in the Cape, and tries to
find something positive to say about Frank Arendse. He is the small, brown
man who has just become the first non-white mayor of a white town in South
Africa.
It is obviously difficult for Pepler, a prosperous Afrikaner, to believe
that a 'coloured' (mixed race) farm labourer's son now wears the mayoral
chain of a town ruled by whites since Huguenot refugees first settled in
this spectacular cul-de-sac of the Franschhoek mountains in 1694. He is not
alone in this - either in Franschhoek or in the rest of South Africa, where
local government integration will eventually mean black, brown or Indian
mayors in almost all towns.
History, of course, is on Pepler's side: his is the name recorded on the
tombstones in the old church graveyard, where the frontier families who
founded Franschhoek are buried, while the 'coloured' population rates hardly
a mention in the official town history. It notes merely that, in 1875, 'it
was decided to establish a separate coloured congregation' of the local
church, and that the congregation's first pastor, the Rev. Haylett, 'had to
use great tact in persuading the three remaining coloured families adhering
to the parent congregation to join the mission (coloured) congregation.'
Three-quarters of a century later, in the 1950s, Franschhoek's leaders
abandoned tact altogether and removed coloured residents forcibly from their
houses in the town - with its gables and its wrought iron, a gem of Cape
Dutch architecture - to Groendal, a site about 1km distant where the houses
are cheap and crowded and the streets are dirt or mud. Power and prosperity
remained in the white town, with its lovely vistas of granite mountains and
vineyards.
Now, almost 300 years after the first Huguenot settlement, history has
driven Franschhoek to find a new political centre of gravity: among
coloureds, who outnumber whites by 3,500 to 1,000, and to whom power will
pass in a post-apartheid South Africa. The whites of Franschhoek (along with
most in South Africa) have seen the future, and they know it is non-white.
They have little choice: in Pepler's butchery, the clients are coloured and
the shop assistant is coloured. Only Pepler is white. He assures me that
many town residents oppose the idea of a coloured mayor (his neighbours say
he is one of them, although he is too clever to say so to a journalist).
Pepler's argument is more subtle: Arendse is inexperienced, he says,
dismissing the whole issue by arguing that it hardly matters who is mayor of
Franschhoek, anyway - the real power lies with the town clerk. Arendse
reckons, though, that about 80 per cent of whites support him, and a straw
poll of whites shopping in the high street on a sunny afternoon this week
suggested he probably was right.
Certainly, there was nothing to force white Franschhoek to choose a coloured
mayor: until one month ago, the town council was all-white and always
elected a mayor from its ranks. Last month, however, the administrator of
the Cape province granted Franschhoek permission to merge the white council
and the coloured 'management committee' which advised the council on
coloured affairs, creating one of South Africa's first multi-racial local
councils. Arendse was elected from the enlarged council on September 28,
with votes from six coloured councillors and two whites (probably those who
are members of the liberal Democratic party).
A modest man who smiles nervously when speaking publicly (especially in
English, his second language after Afrikaans), Arendse says he feels keenly
the pressure to perform. 'If I can't deliver the goods, then the whole idea
of one (multi-racial) council can be a flop in other parts of the country.
All the eyes are on me: can a coloured man run a town?'
Most whites say they are happy for him to try - so long as he does not
support the African National Congress (ANC). The new mayor has assured them
that he is no radical - he was a prison warder for 13 years at the same jail
where Nelson Mandela spent his last years in captivity, and has since built
up his own liquor and disco business in the township - but his friends say
his sympathies are with the ANC (which, to his annoyance, has condemned him
as a puppet because he was not elected democratically.
Still, Pepler thinks nothing much will change in Franschhoek: the white
council already was spending 70 per cent of the town budget on upgrading the
coloured township (whites fund three-quarters of the budget with residential
and commercial rates), and Arendse says it will be difficult to spend more
without funding from outside, perhaps from overseas.
Grudgingly, Pepler concedes the new mayor could prove a success, especially
as there are 'lots of people (ie, whites) on the council to help him.' Does
that mean he is ready for a black man as president? 'That's another thing
altogether,' says the butcher, demonstrating that even if one irrational
prejudice can be overcome, others remain.
'We're used to coloureds,' he explains. 'But blacks? No, we're not used to
the blacks at all.' And that means Nelson Mandela.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Nostalgia rules in 'Radio Times' - Malcolm Rutherford
on the revival of Noel Gay's music at the Queen's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOEL GAY, the composer who died in 1954, is enjoying a remarkable revival.
Me and My Girl has been running at London's Adelphi Theatre for the last
seven years and thoroughly deserves its success. It has an irresistible song
in 'The Lambeth Walk', as well as a romantic Pygmalion-type story to go with
it.
Now we have Radio Times at the Queen's which, judging by the reaction of the
first night audience, could equally well be a hit. Whether it will survive
as long as Me and My Girl, taking it almost to the second millennium,
depends on the strength of the market for nostalgia, which in Britain should
not be underestimated.
For nostalgia is what Radio Times is about. There is a slight play on words
in the title. This is not Radio Times, the magazine: it is the time when
radio was dominant, there was practically no television and very little
independent broadcasting. Like the old wireless, the show takes a while to
warm up.
The year is 1941. The BBC Light Programme, a piece of nostalgia in itself,
is transmitting its Variety Bandwagon on the short wave live to the United
States of America. There is a political purpose: namely to enlist American
support for the British war effort. Yet there is, as always, a British
bureaucracy which gets in the way, especially of the BBC. The newly
appointed producer is really the censor from the Home Office who wants all
scripts submitted in advance. The programme goes ahead only when the censor
turns native and agrees to appear in it himself. There are also some
romantic attachments - just enough to keep the story alive.
But forget the plot, such as it is. Radio Times is primarily an excuse to
revive some of that Light Programme music, with biggish bands, jaunty and
sentimental songs, corny and sometimes risque jokes. 'What do you get if you
cross a leopard and a detective? A spotted dick.'
The star moment comes towards the end when Gary Strong, the British-born
Hollywood movie star who has returned to England to join the RAF, delivers
an address to the Americans on how the British are coping with the blitz.
Yes, it is sentimental; it is also moving. The movie star, played by Jeff
Shankley, has already shown in the first half that there is still a place
for the conventionally handsome, impeccably mannered straight male lead. It
might be hard to imagine this in 1992, but Shankley pulls it off.
Other pleasures include the appearance of the 12-man band on stage at the
end of the first act: previously the musicians had been mysteriously hidden.
Then there is the sound of the bombing after the interval. Sound effects
play a large part in the show. There is a wonderful part for a man called
Jeeps (played by James Buller) who looks every inch like a BBC recruit circa
1940 in pullover and baggy trousers. He is responsible on stage for the
amateur sound effects that accompanied the Light Programme. He turns out to
be a hero, of course. Not the least attraction, and another part of the
nostalgia, are the long, shapely legs of the BBC chorus.
I was less drawn by the love interest between the show's anchorman, played
by Tony Slattery, and his fellow performer and girl friend (Kathryn Evans).
This is soap before it reached television. Still, they acquit themselves
very well and they marry in the end.
As in the nature of musicals some songs are better than others. You cannot
quarrel, however, with 'Run, Rabbit, Run' and 'There's Something About a
Soldier'. Less well known, but strikingly effective, is Gay's 'Just Once
More'. The show is directed by David Gilmore. He should speed up the start
and realise that sometimes that it looks about to be the interval and even
the end when it is not. Otherwise, his direction is pretty well without
blemish.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Landscapes of distress - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC exhibition of distressful family relationships is one of Radio
4's less attractive obsessions. A current series on Thursdays, Relative
Values, offers such examples, not, as you might think, to stop other
families falling into these troubles, but simply to display how such folk
exist. Last week, Ian Marchant told us how his two marriages had worked out.
His first wife died in mid-divorce (due to incompatibility); his second
decided to set up a separate home, like Mia Farrow. Surely their problem,
not ours?
This week we met the Glaziers. They adopted 9-year-old Fay, daughter of a
single parent, who thought they would be a nice family 'like in the Bisto
advertisements'. They had two sons - Robert 'lonely' but destructive (he set
fire to his school), Stephen more friendly. Fay was deliberately naughty;
she got on well with Stephen, but Robert kicked her around. As she grew up,
there was jealousy between the boys; then Robert died of pneumonia and Fay
became pregnant by Stephen, indeed married him, to his mother's
embarrassment as she told the registrar that they were legally brother and
sister. The cases are presented by Dr Michael O'Donnell, but without
significant comment.
Tomorrow you can hear Growing Up with Grief, interviews with people who have
experienced the death of a parent in their youth, many of them still young.
Their reactions are not uniform: it's taken six years to get over it, says
one; next day it was as if nothing had happened, says another. Why did any
of them want a million or so listeners to Radio 4 to hear about it? Caroline
Snell is the presenter.
A better place for such matters is in the drama, where it can all come right
in the end. Monday's My Girl, by Barrie Keeffe, is a close-up of a young
married couple, Sam and Anita, living in poverty in the East End. They have
routine quarrels, another girl is hinted at, the dejections of privation are
constantly displayed (though Sam's bank manager allows him vast overdrafts).
Yet it ends with the birth of a second baby and the disputes forgotten -
though the concluding disc is overlaid with the girl's sobs. Karl Howson and
Cathy Tyson are the players, Ned Chaillet the director.
Saturday night's serial (only two parts) is Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter,
another landscape of distress, though more imaginative. In Boston,
Massachusetts, in 1642, in the witch-hunting era, Hester Prynne is lucky not
to be reckoned a witch, for she has had a daughter with no known father.
Instead, she has to stand three hours a day on the scaffold, with a red
capital A, for adulteress, on her dress. Later, expelled from town, she
lives by needlework.
It is a very good tale, more exciting than you might guess, and suitably
directed by Tracey Neale. Deborah Findlay is the unhappy Hester. We have yet
to learn the role of the young priest, Arthur Dimmesdale, played by Michael
Maloney.
Addicts to the World Service should welcome the new monthly BBC Worldwide.
At Pounds 1.75 in the UK, it includes the old London Calling, listing the
World Service's English-language radio and television programmes, now bound
up with magazine features on news, business, arts and sport. In developing
countries, the London Calling section may be taken separately, free.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: An innocent who strayed - Nigel Andrews puts the
'Woody affair' in perspective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN WB Yeats wrote that the 'ceremony of innocence is drowned,' Woody Allen
was not in the poet's mind. But the words could be a copyline pasted onto
the latest showbiz scandal to shake the modern world.
'World' is not overstating it, nor is 'shake.' They talk of it in Italy,
where TV stations have been in a pother about showing Allen's series of
Italian supermarket commercials. They talk of it in France where l'affaire
Woody is taken as seriously as l'affaire Dreyfus. And in New York and Los
Angeles they talk of almost nothing else; though time out is sometimes
allowed for the Presidential election to be mentioned.
As for Britain, we will no doubt join the chat-wagon next week when Husbands
And Wives opens. This is Allen's supposedly semi-autobiographical account of
his relationship with Mia Farrow, already breaking up if we believe our
screens before all the talk of nude photos, affairs with youngsters and
video testimony.
As anyone knows who has followed this story, picking the facts from the
furore is about as easy - and as enjoyable - as taking the bones out of a
rabbit stew. Public knowledge stretches to the fact that Allen's longtime
girlfriend Mia Farrow blew the whistle on his affair with Farrow's adopted
daughter Sun-Li shortly after discovering nude photos of Sun-Li in Woody's
apartment.
If this had happened to any VIP other than a movie star, we might have had a
few week's statutory brouhaha and then the matter would have been ploughed
over by history. But scandals in the cinema have a special impact, for we
feel we know the performer as a friend. He or she struts before us, blown up
to a size where we can examine and approve every physical or moral pore. In
comedy this approval is crucial, since with rare sourpuss exceptions like
Groucho Marx and WC Fields the comedy star is an innocent who wins laughter
by straying into accidents.
What happens when they stray into the buckshot of personal scandal we know
from movie precedents no less momentous in their day than the Allen affair.
Silent comedy star Fatty Arbuckle was ruined by a rape case. Chaplin's
conjugal love life was impaled on the front pages when he defended cruelty
charges from his wife. (Inter alia, he was obliged publicly to defend oral
sex as a legitimate marital practice). And recently America's Pee Wee
Herman, cinema and TV's Mr Innocence to a generation of sub-teeners, was
arrested outside a Florida porn cinema and swiftly subjected to career
dismemberment.
Woody Allen, even in this company, is something special. More than a comic,
he has presented himself as a social philosopher: giving us highly-wrought
moral fables like September and Crimes And Misdemeanors. And not content
with the arm's-length lampoonery of early genre spoofs like Bananas and
Sleeper, Allen has more and more put his own life on screen, barely
transmuted in films like Annie Hall, Manhattan and Stardust Memories.
No wonder his fans were doubly scandalised when news broke of his affair
with a virtual foster-daughter, soon followed by other salacious rumours.
Those fans felt twice conned. First: for them Allen's acting persona had
always been that of a bug-eyed sexual incompetent. Second: no get-out clause
was available establishing that Allen the man was different from Allen the
movie-maker since his own life, not least his own love life and
actress-lovers, kept crowding up the screen.
We could say that the Allen scandal, subjected to tabloid microscopy and
impending video testimony, is just one piece in an expanding mosaic of
disillusioning exposes precipitated by our closed-circuit communications
world. What ever goes on today, in any room in the house called Planet
Earth, we can see it on the monitor. Fergie topless by the pool; Diana's
errant emotional life picked up by a radio ham; Rock Hudson's sexuality
rumbled by a state-of-the-art disease. Who can be innocent in a world with
such sleepless, sophisticated surveillance powers?
But it's a measure of Allen's own perverse honesty, as his career has
evolved, that he has presented himself and the world less and less as a
simple collision between primary forces: innocence (himself) and the
bewilderments of evil or of mature experience (the world).
As early as Manhattan Allen the 'innocent' was having a full-blown romance
with an under-age girl (Mariel Hemingway). A year later in Stardust Memories
Allen was a prickly film-maker snapping at his fans and juggling with three
love affairs, including another young girl (Jessica Harper). And as if the
shrugging off of sexual commandments was not enough, in Hannah And Her
Sisters we watched Allen shrug off God himself: boldly stepping into a
comedy of heresy where he tried and rejected every brand name in the
superstore of world religions.
More recently, September and Crimes And Misdemeanors were all about guilt,
and about modern man's agonised oscillation between honesty and concealment
in a world where the 'eyes of God' might have closed but where other eyes
keep eternal watch.
Yet we are still asked by many to believe that Allen's oeuvre is all about
knockabout innocence. For the professional moralists who shrill their
disappointment at a one-time idol's fall from grace, Moviedom's eternal
schoolboy has been caught doing naughty things behind the bike shed. Or
worse, that schoolkid has grown up without telling us and is now interfering
with other schoolkids.
But those who believe Woody Allen is an artist of innocence stopped watching
his films years ago, even if they technically saw them. They arrested time
in the late 1960s, circa Take The Money And Run, when they first fell in
love with a gesticulating human insect gifted with querulous one-liners.
They ignored the darker sexual shadings of Manhattan and Stardust Memories
and they shunned overwrought thinkfests like Interiors and Another Woman.
In some cases they have this critic's sympathy. Allen in earnest mood is not
the modern-day Ibsen he thinks he is. But equally he cannot be blamed for
presenting an 'innocent' persona when that persona was laid off years ago.
None of this would excuse Allen for being less than an 'innocent' in real
life. But then that is not the real charge movie fans are levelling for the
wound they feel he has inflicted on them. They believe that Woody Allen's
function and achievement was to go on providing them with ceremonies of
innocence: to spin an eternal childhood of lovable, stammering
incomprehension confronting a wicked, implacable world. For them that
ceremony of innocence has been drowned by the scandal. In cinema, once the
world's audiences have decided that an artist cannot grow up, he does so
only at his own, possibly terminal peril.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Venture to St Pancras
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USING the Victorian Gothic vastness of St Pancras Station to show specially
commissioned work by a selection of contemporary artists is an exciting
idea, which has been brought to fruition in an exhibition organised by
Camden Arts Centre. Until November, work by 12 European artists can be seen
in a two part show at the station and the gallery.
Northern Adventures, however, is a project that fails to fulfil its promise,
partly because of attempting to include too much in its brief, and partly
because of the very grandeur of its setting - St Pancras is a hard place to
co-opt. What is perhaps most disappointing is how little effort the invited
artists appear to have made to do so. To be fair, what appears to be a
somewhat tentative intervention is partly explained by the station
authorities' duty to protect the listed structure: the piece by Antoni
Malinowski, for example, now a subtle curving of painted canvas seeping
along the ground from the edges of an entrance archway, was originally a
much more adventurous concept. Part of the problem also has been an attempt
by the organisers' to hasten the venerable station into the European age.
'Common Knowledge,' the piece by Jane Mulfinger which uses the glass panels
of the ticket booths to display jokes about 'funny foreigners' in a variety
of languages seems ill placed in a station from which the furthest
destination that I could discover is Leeds. Indeed, the whole ambience of St
Pancras is that of a Britain of some other, more innocent age, no later than
the 1950s, still firmly rooted in the industrial past celebrated in the iron
girders which hold up the station roof and proclaim themselves the work of
'The Billerley Company, Derbyshire, 1867'.
St Pancras also seems immune from some of the worst of modern station tat.
Its kiosks are modest, its refreshment room functioning soberly despite a
surface patina of plastic. Here, picking up the mood, Sonia Boyce has
printed tablecloths with quotations from Brief Encounter. Also taking a
suburban theme are pieces from Maya and Stuart Brisley. Hers is a poem
reproduced on a steel plate in red and black, his a model of a house made of
black steel mesh. Both works have a brooding quality, a sense of doom. 'It
isn't right to remind people of death like that all the time,' a station
worker said. bag
The best piece in the exhibition is one that is both its most and its least
accessible. Cornelia Parker has produced a set of six postcards of work made
in the station hotel, itself forbidden to public access. The photos, richly
coloured and beautifully composed, show mysterious installations, some of
which make use of the Gothic patterning of the hotel decor - soot making
trefoil patterns on floorboards, white chalk repeating decorative motifs on
the grey slates of the roof. Parker's work is clever, a wise response to a
difficult setting. Parker pitches it just right, conscious of the works'
location in a setting which must inevitably make them look small.
She is also the only exhibitor to address any of the features or problems of
the area in which the station is situated: one card shows call girls'
advertisement stickers scattered inside the station clock, another shows
half-lemons suspended in a window (local residents are used to discovering
these, discarded by junkies who use them as a mean of enhancing their fix.)
After dark in the exhibition's final week, Anne Bean and Peter Fink will
project a piece on the station facade, shrouded in plastic while restoration
work is carried out beneath. Perhaps their skill with projected and other
sources of light and flair for dramatic effect will bring 'Northern
Exposures' the finale its setting deserves.

to November 15; Camden Arts Centre, Arkwright Road, London NW3 6DG Tel 071

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Gentle musings from Giuffre's clarinet - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROMOTED as a double bill alongside pianist Don Pullen's trio, it is Jimmy
Giuffre's reedy deliberations that is the draw on this rare UK tour. Times
and tastes change: 30 years ago, Giuffre's fragile clarinet, set against the
subtle colour of pianist Paul Bley and Steve Swallow's yearning electric
bass fell out of favour with West Coasters. For nearly a decade Giuffre
himself withdrew from performance altogether, made tentative recordings in
the 1970s and has only recently re-emerged.
After 26 years absence the reformed drummerless trio's meandering melodies
are finding a new audience. ECM, the sophisticated German label, has even
re-released the delicate chamber jazz which in the early 1960s was said to
have been the group's downfall, Fusion and Thesis.
A shared peace within its gentle musings remains the key to the trio's
attraction today: they do not so much improvise as intimate. Opening with a
gentle flurry of notes from the clarinet which is echoed first by Swallow
and then by Bley, Giuffre barely leads this dreamy ensemble, with a sound
which gives the impression of a reed wrapped in muslin. Switching to alto, a
relatively new choice of instrument, the gauze tone is pierced only
occasionally, encouraged by the blue washed colours of Bley, who stands up
occasionally to change the harmonics by reaching under the lid. Swallow,
like the others white haired and dressed in tasteful shades of charcoal,
gives structure with wiry plectrum-picked bass lines.
Even as Giuffre, an absent minded character, changes to almost lead on
soprano, the balance of the trio remains the same. Its overall effect is
both soothing and engrossing because although the dynamics of this
drummerless group are low, the component improvisation is full of detail. It
is only to be hoped that it all reached the back of the hall  - from the
comfort of the stalls it was touching.
Don Pullen's more conventional trio of piano, upright bass and drums was no
less easy on the ear but more likely to reach every corner of the hall. Its
leader's big folky melodies - 'Richard's Tune', 'Variation on Ode to Life',
and 'Indio-Gitano' - were spelled out in tart notes and backhanded sweeps
along the keyboard. The alternately charged runs and then thoughtful rimshot
technique of long time partner Cindy Blackman was more than a match for her
leaders' own Spanish heel clicking accompaniment. Possibly better known for
exciting avalanches of chords, Pullen surprised on this evening, however,
with seductive and almost too poignant unfolding cadenzas.
The Contemporary Music Network is sponsored by the Arts Council. The tour
continues to Sheffield Crucible Theatre (Oct 18); Leeds Irish Centre (21);
Manchester Royal Northern College of Music (22); Cardiff Tythe Barn (23);
Birmingham Adrian Boult Hall (24)

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Museum for the man in the street - How user-friendly
is the V&amp;A? Antony Thorncroft talks to Mrs Esteve-Coll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST FIVE years ago Elizabeth Esteve-Coll took over as director of the
Victoria &amp; Albert Museum to a barrage of criticism unprecedented even in the
bitchy world of museum politics. Previous V&amp;A directors disparaged her
intellect; senior members of staff howled their protest at her supposed
Philistinism. She was seen to be a Thatcherite appointment, under orders to
bring market forces into what was seen as a cosy society of indolent,
pampered, curators.
Her expressed wish to open up the V&amp;A to the man in the street, making the
collection accessible to a wider audience through detailed labels and audio
visual presentations, struck at the traditional view of the museum as a
place where scholars could quietly enjoy the finest collection of
Renaissance bronzes outside Italy, or study an unrivalled array of Georgian
furniture.
In January Mrs Esteve-Coll starts her second five year term. Her
re-appointment by her Trustees offers a good opportunity to assess her
radical stewardship. How far has she changed her vision into reality?
Well, in the numbers game the V&amp;A scores heavily, with attendances up 26 per
cent this year to date, to over 880,000. The museum looks much better,
simply sparkling with new galleries - for Indian art, for Chinese, for
Japanese, with a refurbished 20th century gallery opening next week, and one
devoted to Korean art in December. Large exhibitions are reappearing at the
V&amp;A, like the successful Visions of Japan and the unsuccessful Sovereign, a
celebration of 40 years a Queen.
The gleam of Mrs Esteve-Coll shines brightest in the Choi gallery of Chinese
art. It was financed by a Hong Kong businessman. Its content was determined
by market research into what the public wants. It covers Chinese culture
through universal themes - displays devoted to eating and drinking, worship,
ruling, burial, etc - themes with which a modern family visiting the V&amp;A on
a Sunday afternoon can relate and a world away from the traditional cabinets
crammed with a hundred Tang horses and two hundred Ming vases.
She is quite explicit. 'The role of this museum is education. That was why
it was founded - to improve the taste of the general public in art and
design, and to improve the taste of manufacturing industry. In the last five
years we have gone back to these first principles.'
This means that the museum is now heaving with school parties. Eighteen
months ago 10,000 children visit the V&amp;A. Now it is 50,000 a year. By 1994
it will have risen to 100,000. They will gather in the converted Old Boiler
House gallery which becomes an educational centre.
This return to first principles is linked to the new national curriculum and
the willingness of Government and industry to finance such expansion. All
through the Esteve-Coll reign at the V&amp;A there has been this close
interweaving between change and money. It is not hard to notice that most of
the new galleries concentrate on oriental art - that is where sponsorship is
forthcoming. Critics bemoan the fact that one of the traditional strengths
of the V&amp;A - its English furniture collection - has not received such lavish
renovation. Who would pay for the overhaul?
Mrs Esteve-Coll is undoubtedly alive to the links between art and finance.
She has supported her Trustees over the introduction of a voluntary donation
from visitors, which brings in Pounds 1m a year. She is proud of the fact
that this month saw the start of a series of travelling exhibitions of the
V&amp;A treasures in Japan, with the useful fee compensating for their temporary
loss.
But she is adamant that the driving force behind her changes is much more
mundane than making the museum a cost effective business. 'Most of our
developments are driven by the condition of the roof'. That is why the
Indian gallery received early treatment: its roof actually leaked. Now the
hunt is on for money to patch up the Sculpture Court and the Raphael Court.
But where does this leave the scholar and the aesthete? Unlike the average
visitor he might not welcome the relabelling of the Donatello sculptures,
with large graphic panels relating the sculptor to the Italian Renaissance.
He might want to examine a hundred George II chairs or as many Victorian
fabrics, looking for marginal differences. It leaves him in Battersea or
Olympia where the V&amp;A has stored away in warehouses 350,000 objects which
are readily available to anyone interested.
Is there then a two layered V&amp;A, the spruced up South Kensington Museum,
making the arts and crafts of the world accessible to the general public,
and out-stations for the scholars? No, the layers stretch on up to the
fourth floor of South Kensington where there are still many of the V&amp;A's 154
galleries which have lain undisturbed for half a century or more.
Elizabeth Esteve-Coll is aware of the problem. She is moving on from the Art
and Design departments, which display art in context, to the Methods and
Technologies galleries, which concentrate on a single medium. Glass is the
first to get the treatment, with the result that by January 1994 98.5 per
cent of the V&amp;A's holdings will be on display.
It would be naive to believe that the V&amp;A is now a settled, placid, ship
like the National Gallery. Brimming with nervous energy Mrs Esteve-Coll is
constantly pushing - pushing the scholars for more publications, the
Government for more money to shore up the building, the staff to smile more;
herself with a hectic schedule to keep sponsors sweet.
The overwhelming impression is of activity. A constant flow of new
exhibitions: of sporting trophies, including the Ashes, in November; of the
new silver commissioned for 10 Downing Street in January; and the costume
designs for the frothy TV success House of Eliott later next year. Then
there is the plethora of new galleries - one devoted to Frank Lloyd Wright
in January follows on the Korean and the 20th century.
There is perhaps an air of uneasy compromise about the place. The dodging of
the admission charge issue; the revitalised galleries being sponsorship led;
the gulf between the undoubted scholarship that thrives at the V&amp;A with the
exhibitions of work by hip graphic designer Neville Brody, an unconvincing
show of pop ephemera, and a free plug for Elton John's collection before its
sale at Sotheby's. But undoubtedly Mrs Esteve-Coll has survived and brought
her vision - 'the professionalisation of the whole museum' - to some sort of
fulfilment. The V&amp;A looks better, is more exciting, has a wider appeal, and
is humming as never before.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Literary feast in Cheltenham - Criticism, therapy,
crime, BA Young experiences it all at this year's festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This year's Festival, which has just completed its first week, is immensely
successful.
The opening day included a memorial reading for Alan Hancox, the Cheltenham
bookseller who has long been the Festival's patron saint and occasional
director - perhaps mainly of local interest, but the readings were by Ted
Hughes, Seamus Heaney, Michael Foot and Melvyn Bragg, no modest assembly.
Then a debate, about war correspondents' capacity to give the whole truth,
between America's Martha Gellhorn, the BBC's John Simpson, and Max Hastings,
Editor of The Daily Telegraph, which currently sponsors the Festival. The
day's rousing conclusion was Anthony Burgess's Cheltenham Lecture, on
translation; his versions of Roman dialect verses included four-letter words
seldom heard in that hall.
Is there any special theme? a visitor asked me. Half-a-dozen at least, from
which you might choose biography, travel, therapy or crime before reaching
mere literary criticism or plain old poetry (for which poets have an hour
every day).
Therapy may seem unexpected, but we had an interesting analysis of Salman
Rushdie's Haroun and the Sea of Stories by Kleinian analyst Hanna Segal.
Wordsworth's Prelude was psych-ed by Dr Ronald Britton, and George Eliot's
Middlemarch by AS Byatt and Ignes Sodre. For the opposition, Against Therapy
was a superbly witty attack on therapists by Fay Weldon, in which she read
some of her next novel. Travel was sensibly discussed together by Redmond
O'Hanlon, Colin Thubron and Gillian Tindall, and less seriously by humorist
Miles Kington, who travels with a double-bass.
Crime fielded a strong side. PD James asked How Good are Crime Novels? - is
crime trivialised? can the writer get properly into the criminal mind? As
Lady James has entered another field in her newest novel, perhaps she felt
too many literary handcuffs. In Serious Crime, three days later, Ruth
Rendell, Julian Symons and HRF Keating paced the same field with their own
individual tread; and next morning, Patrick Marnham discussed Simenon, whose
biography he published this year. John Mortimer affectionately offered a
parade of both fictional and real villains.
Biography was well represented too. The practice of the art was luminously
examined by Hilary Spurling in her account of her researches into Ivy
Compton-Burnett's family, and into Paul Scott's undeclared years. Richard
Hoggart dealt with the craft of autobiography, having written three. Among
the biographers, Richard Holmes was enlightening on the circumstances of
Shelley's death; Humphrey Carpenter on Benjamin Britten's life. Three
left-wing ex-Ministers, Tony Benn, Barbara Castle and Roy Jenkins,
approached the question of political memoirs' truth mainly through their own
writing.
Today's theatre was sharply dealt with by critic Michael Billington. London
theatre was sacrificed to musicals, while the two great subsidised
companies, the Royal National and the Royal Shakespeare, were doing work the
world might envy. There were many good young writers, but much of the
interesting theatre was in the regions. The previous evening, Billington had
been straight man to John Schlesinger's talk on directing films. It was
characteristic of the care with which this year's programme was organised
that the local Odeon gave showings of the films he spoke of.
Nigel Nicolson was authoritative on Vita and Harold; Richard Ingrams devoted
on Chesterton; John Julius Norwich and Artemis Cooper assured on the letters
between Evelyn Waugh and Lady Diana Cooper. The annual Shakespeare Lecture
was given by John Bayley on Shakespeare's Enemies, the commentators who
impose false emphases or meanings on the plays; and the Cheltenham Lecture
by Peter Ackroyd, in a marvellous hour on Englishness and the English
Language. He traced a specific character in English from Philip Sidney to
the middle of the 19th century, the equivalent of Hogarth's 'line of beauty'
 -now no more.
This is no exhaustive view of what we have heard so far in the Festival,
superbly directed by Richard Cohen. There was a children's drama festival
too, four newly-commissioned plays, that alas I had no time for. More when
the Festival is done.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: Fastest bar in the West - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>

ONE OF London's most cherished monuments, the Albert Memorial, has been
covered in scaffolding for almost two and a half years now. It is likely to
be many more years before a rehabilitated and restored Memorial comes into
view.
The Albert Memorial, along with other construction projects underway in the
Royal Palaces and Parks, seems set to take the full brunt of the cost
cutting exercise underway in the new Heritage Ministry. The penny seems to
have dropped that in an enlarged Ministry, with responsibility for
broadcasting, sport, the press, etc, as well as the arts, money can be found
for the more vociferous lobbys, such as the performing arts, at the expense
of the more pacific, like the Royal Parks.
A battle royal is taking place between the new Minister, Peter Brooke, and
the Treasury over the size of the Department's 1993-94 grant. At first a
freeze was proposed for such key clients as the Arts Council but it was
pointed out that if the Government reneged here so would arts sponsors, and
the arts could lose two sources of income. There was also a feeling that a
new Minister deserved a break. Even so, arts companies have been warned to
expect at best a marginal increase in grant.
And any more money for drama, music, dance, etc. will be at the expense of
the poor old Albert Memorial. It would cost around Pounds 14m to restore it
to its fully glory, half that to patch it up for 50 years. Neither sum is
likely to be forthcoming. The scaffolding may well be the only support the
Memorial gets for many years.
The fastest bar in the West End is the circle at the Coliseum. That is the
kind of vital information that was available at the first Stage Fair, held
at the Theatre Royal Drury Lane this week.
The Fair was arranged by the Society of West End Theatreas a drum beating
occasion. In fact, given the recession, and steadily rising ticket prices,
the West End has survived miraculously well to date - audiences are up 3 per
cent on the year, although the last month shows a 2 per cent decline on
September 1991. Hence the need to sell shows to that increasingly vital
customer, the organiser of group bookings.
Group bookings - parties of 12 or more - make up 10 per cent of the West End
audience now as against 4 per cent six years ago. Of course they are the
playthings of market forces. Shows like Phanthom of the Opera have no need
of groups, and at the best offer them tickets at face value, while the
walking wounded among the musicals (groups concentrate on booking musicals)
will offer up to 50 per cent discounts for matinees or Monday nights.
The theatre does seem to be getting its act together. Annie Get Your Gun,
which opens next month, is actually making another bid for a Sunday matinee
audience, despite the extra costs and the fact that previous attempts to
develop this market fizzled out.
The world's most unlikely capitalists must be the staff and audience of the
Theatre Royal, Stratford East, who keep the Red Flag flying with the
politically correct plays that make up their programme, along with hit
musicals. But now a company, Stratford East Productions, has been
capitalised with Pounds 250,000 from mainly tiny 'angels' to take the
theatre's current success The Invisible Man into the West End.
Stratford's enthusiasm for Shaftesbury Avenue has been fueled by its
experience with Five Men Named Moe which has totally transformed the
commercial fortunes of the theatre. Moe started at Stratford where it was
picked up by producer Cameron Mackintosh who saw its West End and Broadway
potential.
Mackintosh is rich enough to make a generous gesture and he allocated
Stratford a third of any profits, plus additional perks: most producers
would have offered just 2 per cent of any gross revenues. Moe has made over
Pounds 500,000 for Stratford East.
The Invisible Man attracted its share of commercial producers anxious to
take it on but none with an offer that compared to the deal on Moe. Hence
the decision to form its own production company, which ensures Stratford 40
per cent of any profits with 60 per cent to share among the angels. Other
suburban theatres have chased the same money making dream, notably the Lyric
Hammersmith and the King's Head, with indifferent success, but Stratford
East reckons that it has a certain winner in Ken Hill's adaptation of the HG
Wells novel. And, to make this a victory for the little man, the biggest
backer of the show, with a Pounds 50,000 stake, is willing to sell off
smaller shares to stage-struck investors.
The only problem now is Christmas. Unless a West End theatre of around 800
seats falls vacant in the next week The Invisible Man would face the
prospect of a December opening, a bad time to launch a new musical. But with
everyone so psyched up, a regional tour could probably keep the cast
together for a few more months and permit a 1993 West End debut.

FT  17 OCT 92 / Arts: A painter who plays with perspectives - William Packer
reviews the work of John Wonnacott
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN WONNACOTT is as ambitious a painter as any currently at work in
England, both in the scale of his paintings and the complexity of the formal
problems which he sets himself.
He is also remarkably prolific. The large upper gallery and the stairs at
Agnew's is now filled with the work he has done in the past two years. His
subjects embrace the wide beachscapes of his home at Leigh-on-Sea, in Essex,
and interiors at times no less extensive. Recent commissions include a
portrait of the late chairman of British Caledonian, Sir Adam Thompson, high
on a gangway above an aircraft-building workshop, for the Scottish National
Portrait Gallery, and a substantial sequence of paintings of the Naval refit
dockyard at Devonport, initiated by the Imperial War Museum. As a painter of
the technological landscape, whether of a factory or a radio-telescope, he
is on his own.
But for all its variety and grandiosity, the essential subject of the work
now on show is altogether more consistent and mundane. One of the largest
canvases in the show, and one moreover that is entirely characteristic of
the whole, depicts no aircraft hangar, no battleship, no crane or telescope,
but only a standard easel set in the centre of the studio, and on it a
mirror in which the artist sees himself. The easel reaches up into the
ceiling void, to probe and define the space itself. Below, the easel-legs
and palette-stool fall away by the pictorial logic of the forced,
vertiginous perspective. And in the centre sit the mirror and the artist,
the one a flat plane within the real, perceived space of the room, the other
within the mirror's own proposed, reflected space - surface upon surface,
space within space.
Wonnacott's subject is the space itself, the space occupied and animated by
object or figure, and realised by all the devices of perspective, paint and
line. His perspectives are more often forced than not, which is to say that
rather than being eased apart and accommodated, the several vanishing points
are accepted as they are, their pictorial logic worked through to a
conclusion. As with the monocular fish-eye lens of the camera, the system
rigorously applied leads to a certain distortion. The assumption is easily
made, too easily in Wonnacotts's case, of a reliance upon such photographic
reference.
But there is nothing here of photo-realism. The binocular complexity is all
too evident, the scrutiny direct and unmistakeable, the visual solution
entirely achieved by hand and eye working together at the brush's end. The
long sequence of self-portraits give the game away, if game it is, for there
is no escape from the self-portrait if the artist is to be honest with
himself and his work. Wonnacott's self-portraits by now supply a substantial
oeuvre in themselves, and are at least as fine as anything else he does.
There is no sign here that the supply is about to fail.
Two other current shows require a mention. I reviewed Bridget Riley's
Hayward show at length some two weeks ago, and there is no need now to
rehearse those favourable arguments. All I will say is that her works on
paper now at Karsten Schubert are as authoritative and beautiful as any of
their larger relations across the river.
At Gimpel Fils, Three Score And Ten celebrates Albert Irvin's 70th birthday.
He is a painter quite as remarkable for his energy as for his formal
invention and technical command. And he too is properly ambitious, if only
to celebrate truly in his turn the unfailing visual thrill to be had in the
experience of paint and colour. His is a bravura abstract expressionism to
lift the heart.
John Wonnacott: Agnew's, 43 Old Bond Street W1, until November 6; Albert
Irvin: Gimpel Fils, 30 Davies Street W1, until November 21; Bridget Riley:
Karsten Schubert, 85 Charlotte Street W1, until November 14.

the Murdoch philosophy

METAPHYSICS AS A GUIDE TO MORALS by Iris Murdoch Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 20,
520 pages
A CHARACTER in one of Iris Murdoch's novels believes, under the influence of
a drug, that he is experiencing 'the Good Absolute'. To the friend at his
bedside he looks like a 'wide-browed, huge-eyed god'. Murdoch has always
disclaimed philosophical ambitions for her fiction, but in the light of her
new book - a large, elaborate and visionary philosophical essay - these
images suddenly appear telling. For Murdoch believes in the existence of an
objective Good which touches our lives at every moment, making urgent
demands upon us; and in this richly stimulating work she endeavours to
justify that belief and to explain what it means.
Her central contention is that morality is not peripheral, as now too often
thought, but essential to our lives. To grasp its importance we must attend
to every detail of our inner experience, and we will see that each is
morally charged. We inhabit the familiar yet mysterious continuum of the
present; it is what is nearest to us, and 'it matters what kind of place it
is'.
Living rightly, Murdoch says, is a matter of directing our moral energies by
loving the Good, which is 'absolute and unique, a magnetic focus'.
Fundamentally people just know the difference between good and evil, but the
task is to help them respond to that knowledge. Aesthetic and spiritual
considerations richly play their part in this. Murdoch argues that religion
 -a sense of the sacred, and of there being exigent claims upon us from an
objective authority - is vital here: but what is required is a religion not
of gods or God but of Good: 'Good is the reality of which God is the dream'.
The thinkers to whom Murdoch constantly recurs in meditating these themes
include Simone Weil, Wittgenstein, Schopenhauer and Kant. But the book's
dominating philosophical presence is Plato. Indeed her thesis is Platonist
in an almost literal sense, in that the central characters of the ethical
drama are the solitary private self, with its implicit sense of 'something
higher', and the Form of the Good, the fundamental reality of our world.
The two enemies of belief in the existence of a moral absolute are, Murdoch
argues, science and structuralism (by which she means Derrida's views). Both
enterprises analyse, deconstruct, unpiece the wholeness of things. Science
seeks only facts, and excludes value; structuralism premisses the merely
relativistic nature of truth. Both therefore marginalise morality.
The view that objective Goodness exists, that it is both pervasive and
authoritative in our lives, and that we all know what it is, is familiar
enough in philosophy. Even if it were untrue many would wish it otherwise.
So Murdoch is not offering a new theory. But it is a surprise and a
refreshment to have this view defended again, and in such an original,
sensitive and powerful way. Yet the old doubts remain: can such a view be
argued, or can it at most be urged?
Murdoch recognises that her view cannot be stated in knock-down argument
form. It has to be exhibited from different angles to be made persuasive.
Like other contemporary philosophers Murdoch holds that ethical theory must
trawl widely for its materials, in literature and elsewhere, and that it
best proceeds by seeking patterns and perspectives through which, at last,
one can understand the nature and authority of moral reality. Accordingly
her method is to discuss art, comedy, imagination, religion, and a number of
other themes, in what at first seem to be discontinuous and internally
rambling essays, but which in the end, by accumulation, build the case for
her view. Indeed it is only in the closing chapters that the picture begins
to clarify fully.
The book's appearance of rambling is, however, exacerbated by two things.
First, Murdoch seems to have given up trying to turn a mass of notes into a
treatise, and to have simply transcribed the notes instead, complete with
parenthetical reminders to herself and frequent over-long quotations.
Secondly, there is no signposting; the book begins abruptly and strolls on
by itself, with readers rarely being told what conclusions are being sought
or how the discussion will proceed. Murdoch's commitments emerge at
irregular intervals, but it is only in the short chapters at the end -
doubtless written when she at last began to marshal the growing luxuriance
of notes into a book - that direct statements of her theses appear. In its
form the book resembles a novel; reading a novel is like taking a
night-train to an unknown destination, which is part of the fun. But
discursive literature has a different etiquette.
One hopes that Murdoch has not deterred too many readers by leaving them
mapless in this way, for this is a significant book, lambent with insights,
intelligence, and profound concern, and it hugely rewards careful reading.

PG WODEHOUSE: MAN AND MYTH by Barry Phelps Constable, Pounds 16.95 344 pages
CURRENCY fluctuations ruin the most predictable futures. At Dulwich College,
young PG Wodehouse wrote Latin prose and Greek verse with exceptional
facility. A scholarship at Oxford was the obvious progression. But it was
scuppered by rates of exchange: Wodehouse Senior had taken a pension paid in
rupees, and the rupee failed to clear the fence of Oxford fees. 'Watch the
rupee]' was, apparently, the prelude to any expenditure in the Wodehouse
home; and although the diversion from Oxford into the Honkong and Shanghai
Bank does not seem to have thwarted PG, the cause of the diversion - a
straightforward case of impecuniousness - haunted him for the rest of his
life. He was a millionaire several times over when he died, at last Sir
Pelham Grenville, in 1975; and it is fair to say that money was the main
interest of his life.
He pretended otherwise, of course. But the sordid topic of coin was
prominent in all his dealings with publishers, theatrical collaborators,
family and friends. He was a tough negotiator with the former and immensely
generous to the latter. That failure to reach Oxford was swallowed with an
astonishing lack of self pity (later, Oxford would partly compensate with an
honorary degree, to salute his status as auctor magicus): but it gave motive
to his drive to work almost continually in order to redeem the honour lost
on account of the feeble rupee.
This is an important side of Wodehouse, and worth the stress given to it in
this new biography. But despite the subtitle, Barry Phelps has not produced
a serious piece of demythologising. The subject is 'Plum' or 'The Master'
throughout. The usual apologetics are given for the wartime broadcasts; the
usual broadsides delivered against those (Sean O'Casey, FR Leavis) who dared
question the literary value of Wodehouse. We have a nice vignette of the
elderly Hilaire Belloc, in a mouse-nibbled dressing gown, reading some
choice Wodehouse phrase and exclaiming, 'Admirable] Admirable]'. And
would-be critics are regularly silenced by the citation of book sales and
continued influence. Can millions of contented readers be wrong?
As partial to a dose of Jeeves and Wooster as anyone, I hesitate to join the
tiny claque of Wodehouse detractors. But it has to be said: a better
knowledge of the man's life does not extend one's enjoyment of his work. It
is not that his sex life was negligible; nor that he suffered no
vicissitudes (to be packed into a cattle train across Europe and
incarcerated in a lunatic asylum in Upper Silesia, at sixty, surely
qualifies as a major vicissitude). No: it is just that he was, as far as one
can tell from all testimonies of his biographers, a facile man. His range of
emotional response was restricted to a fault. Even those who are quoted as
substantial buttresses of the Wodehouse achievement must see this.
Evelyn Waugh was one such buttress: but Evelyn Waugh also provides a measure
of the literary shortcomings of PG Wodehouse. There is nothing in Wodehouse
quite so comic as the first part of Waugh's trilogy, Sword of Honour; there
is nothing at all in Wodehouse which comes close to matching the depth and
plangency of Brideshead Revisited. However much enjoyment Wodehouse may have
given Waugh, the two writers are not to be bracketed together. Wodehouse may
not have been a 'performing flea', but to hail his capacity as 'almost
Shakespearean' is pure nonsense. No one doubts the technical calibre of PG
Wodehouse in expressing himself. One simply wishes that he would express
himself more profoundly.
Just what did 'The Master' make of the loss of his 'beloved' stepdaughter
Leonora? How could he forgive the man who attacked him so spitefully on the
BBC? The way in which he reacted to the privations of his arrest by the
Nazis can be partly explained as the defence mechanism of the public
schoolboy who creates a microcosm of institutional security wherever he is
(buckles down in the prison camp and makes a cricket ball from a mass of
rubber bands; gets the games going). But only partly. Either Wodehouse was
not properly wounded by appalling events, or else he kept quiet about them.
This book does not illuminate. The absence of any moral asperity in
Wodehouse's life remains conspicuous. It is a monotone of bland good-nature,
which prevails even when satirising Mosley's blackshirts as Spode's fools in
footer bags. The only people to have ever aroused anything approaching
savage indignation in Wodehouse appear to have been the British and American
tax-collectors.
So there we are: back to the lolly again. It would be perverse to criticise
Wodehouse for liking lots of it; and it may seem equally perverse to
complain of his imperturbable good-naturedness. He resists such detraction:
as Compton Mackenzie put it, criticising Wodehouse is about as graceful as
taking a spade to a souffle. I only murmur a note of dissent. Otherwise, I
love the man still. No book about him can be a bad book.
