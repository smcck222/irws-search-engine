FT  16 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds Chemists
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Chemists' full-year figures make one nostalgic for the 1980s.
Turnover is up by a strapping 106 per cent and profits increased by an
almost equally healthy 78 per cent. Granted much of the expansion was on the
back of paper-driven acquisitions, yet even earnings per share are 20 per
cent higher. Glowing though all that may be, the difficulty with acquisitive
companies is that they often move so fast it is difficult to determine what
they are really worth.
Rapid expansion of the chemist, drugstore and healthfood chains obscures the
view of sales and profits on a comparable basis. Provisions and write-offs
do not make things any clearer. And while gearing is a comfortable 22 per
cent, the asset backing depends in part on the value of pharmacies as
premium retail sites being maintained. It may be instructive to note that
when the government tightened its payment terms to pharmacists in July, the
shares fell sharply. Not only has chemists' income fallen; perhaps the value
of a pharmacist's franchise has declined as well.
Against all the recurring worries about aggressive entrepreneurs coming to
grief, it can be argued that dispensing chemists have a stable business.
However, with Lloyds on a rating half that of the stores sector, the market
is clearly not prepared to take anything on trust.

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK water companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The market was right to be relieved at yesterday's interim pricing agreement
between the water companies and their regulator. Lower K-factors - the
amount by which the companies can increase prices above inflation - will
squeeze profits, but by less than feared. The companies which signed
two-year agreements have also gone some way to reducing regulatory
uncertainty in the run up to the 1995 periodic review scheduled at the time
of privatisation.
Thames has taken this argument a stage further by asking for a change in its
licence which rules out any further tinkering with the pricing formula
between reviews. Thames will have a clearer idea of its likely revenue, but
it will also be unable to pass through extra costs to customers by appealing
to the regulator for a higher K factor. This leaves the company more exposed
to the risk of, say, higher than expected construction prices or new
environmental standards. One can only assume that Ofwat will take this into
account when setting the company's rate of return on capital as part of the
1995 review.
Assuming South West Water can reach agreement today, only North West is left
in dispute. The issue may not be resolved until December, which partly
explains the poor performance of the shares - although the abrupt departure
of the new finance director on Wednesday was hardly reassuring. Still, the
favourable outcome of South West's appeal last year on similar grounds
suggests North West will at least get a fair hearing.

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar's recent defence document was carefully drafted - and just as
well. Referring to discussions with the Financial Reporting Review Panel it
said any consequential amendments to its accounting policies and practices
should not affect the aggregate of shareholders' funds. That subtle
qualification was important. In the light of the panel's damning findings
yesterday Trafalgar announced that it was revising its policy on advance
corporation tax and that this would result in a Pounds 20m write off in the
1991 accounts.
It seems strange that just 10 days ago the Trafalgar directors were so
ignorant of what was about to hit them. Shareholders may be less surprised
at the panel's order to Trafalgar to reverse the way it reclassified certain
current assets into fixed assets. There was, after all, an outcry in the
City and the press at the time because the new classification flattered the
profit and loss account. Nevertheless the whole episode - not least the
unprecedented way in which the accounting watchdog threatened to go to court
to force the company's compliance - casts a further cloud over Trafalgar's
boardroom judgment. Hongkong Land may be a bit cheeky to demand two
representatives for its 15 per cent stake - but it appears that they are
needed.
Yesterday's developments, though, will encourage those in the UK trying to
improve the quality of financial reporting. The panel is lucky that it was
adjudicating on Trafalgar - one of its most high profile victims - at such a
vulnerable stage in its history. The result should bolster its authority.

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: View from the pit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The government seems to have dug itself into a hole which is getting deeper
by the day. That yesterday's unemployment figures were slightly better than
the market expected while average earnings are growing at less than 6 per
cent is of trifling importance. What matters more is that a headline
unemployment rate of more than 10 per cent has been announced in a week in
which the government has taken an axe to the coal industry and spurned a
market opportunity to cut interest rates. It almost begins to look as if it
does not care about recovery at all. After the humiliating exit from the
ERM, such behaviour is asking for political trouble.
So it is not surprising that sterling should be weak. Exchange markets do
not look kindly on countries with economic growth problems whether they are
in or outside the ERM. When there is no growth, anti-inflation defences,
whether they be high interest rates or tight fiscal policy, lose their power
to frighten. It would be difficult for the authorities to undercut German
rates by far and for long. Had they had the confidence to cut rates at the
start of the week, though, sterling might have held up better. Instead the
UK could find itself in a trap where lack of growth makes sterling weak, so
interest rates cannot be cut and the lack of growth is compounded.
Eventually, of course, credibility would be stretched too far and rates
would have to be cut. That might be an occasion for equities to rebound, as
they did after Black Wednesday. Until then the market is bedevilled by sheer
uncertainty as well as by its anxiety at the determination of the government
to cut spending when output is falling. There must be a more coherent
policy. The question is: can the government deliver it?

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Property Market: A profession at the crossroads -
Radical changes look set to overhaul the UK's conservative surveying sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A quiet revolution is under way in the UK's chartered surveying sector. The
growing pressures on the property industry have plunged this most
traditional of professions into a unprecedented period of soul-searching and
restructuring.
The forces at work were illustrated by two events yesterday. First, the
announcement of a merger between Clive Lewis &amp; Partners and Edward Erdman to
create one of the UK's top seven property advisers.
The other was an extraordinary general meeting at the Royal Institution of
Chartered Surveyors (RICS), the profession's ruling body, which agreed
proposals to allow chartered surveying firms to appoint partners from
outside the profession. At present only firms in which all partners or
directors hold RICS' qualifications may call themselves chartered surveyors.
This radical proposal was designed to allow chartered surveying firms to
improve their management and services, by permiting up to a quarter of their
partners or directors to be drawn from other professions such as accountancy
architecture, economics and planning. The proposal would also halt the
decline of the term 'chartered surveyor', since a greater number of the
large practices which already have non-surveyor partners would be allowed to
use the name.
Neither of yesterday's events were isolated incidents. The creation of
Erdman Lewis International from the merger of Edward Erdman and Clive Lewis
is just the latest in a series of recent tie-ups. de Groot Collis, Vigers,
Baker Harris Saunders and Richard Ellis have found partners in Chesterton,
Grimley JR Eve, Herring Son &amp; Daw and Hepper Robinson respectively; Debenham
Tewson &amp; Chinnocks and Bernard Thorpe are the latest to announce merger
talks, which if it goes ahead would create the UK's largest surveying firm.
Similarly, yesterday's vote on RICS' rules was the latest in a series of
structural reforms in which the body has attempted to become more responsive
to the needs of its members and the industry.
Those who argue that change is inevitable say that the surveying sector is
merely following the path of other professions. In the 1980s, chartered
accountancy firms opened up their partnerships to non-accountants in much
the same way as the RICS initiative.
Mr Clive Lewis, who founded Clive Lewis &amp; Partners 30 years ago, is
convinced that the surveying industry - like accountancy following the spate
of mergers in that sector in recent years - will become dominated by a few
broadly based, large, international firms.
Mr Lewis predicts that the pace of mergers is accelerating. The top 24 firms
will be reduced to 16 within a year and 10 in three years.
Some mergers will be a partnership of equals, designed to give the combined
entity a better spread of clients and markets. More, however, will stem from
a financially distressed firm's bid for survival.
Mr Lewis says he was approached by 14 firms over the past six months seeking
a merger. 'Most of the people who are knocking on the door have sizeable
overdrafts, decreasing fee income and are staring down the end of a barrel.'
The spate of mergers and the reform of RICS are rooted in the recession, the
most severe in the property industry for more than 50 years. Surveying firms
realise that they must either offer a fuller, better service to clients, or
cut their overheads and become a niche business serving a specialist market.
Likewise, the depressed state of the industry has given RICS the authority
it needs to ensure its radical proposals are accepted by its members. In the
past winning the support of members has not been easy. The RICS leadership
was, for example, badly bruised in 1989 when a majority of members voted
against its recommendation to merge with the ISVA, a rival professional
body.
Once again, some firms view the current upheavals as a self-serving exercise
by the big London practices. Critics believe the relaxation of rules on the
'chartered' designation will dilute a respected title, earned after years of
training, which differentiates surveyors from unqualified rivals.
But the argument that 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it' that prevailed in
more prosperous times no longer applies. When Mr Christopher Jonas, this
year's president of RICS, recently made his presidential address, he called
for the profession to 'look hard into some of the dark corners which past
boom conditions have allowed us to ignore'.
The surveying industry has to acknowledge that its problems do not just stem
from the recession. Deeper flaws in the industry were highlighted in a
report entitled 'Market Requirements of the Profession', commissioned by
RICS and published last year. The report suggested that the industry had to
become better organised and more responsive to the market.
RICS argues that its new structure, which has resulted in a shift of
decision-making to 'skills' and 'markets' panels, will help address these
complaints. But some tough questions remain. Are the tasks of surveyors too
wide-ranging, diverse and fragmented to be embraced by a single profession?
What value, for instance, does a surveying qualification bring to the
residential property market?
'We must consider whether we can sustain the concept of a single profession
over the longer haul,' says Mr Jonas. 'It will not be good enough for us to
find a fudged solution now and leave our successors with the continuing
doubts we have inherited.'
Already, it is clear that the next generation of surveyors will face
daunting hurdles. One of the foremost is the challenge beyond its borders.
Property is increasingly traded across barriers. 'It will not be sufficient
for us to continue to operate exclusively on a domestic basis . . . over
time we shall just end up a minority specialist group on the world stage,'
says Mr Jonas.
Mr Jonas's sombre and thoughtful assessment should not disguise several
notable achievements in recent years. The industry has been energetic in its
establishment of international networks, for example. While some firms have
failed, several have established enviable reputations in foreign markets.
While surveyors accept many of the criticisms heaped on their profession,
there is also a sense of frustration that their achievements are not better
acknowledged. 'I think it is time the property profession started to fight
back. We have been hiding our light under the bushel,' says Mr Lewis, who as
vice-president of RICS will succeed Mr Jonas next year.
In any event, there can be no doubt that the pressures on the profession are
intensifying. Only if it takes advantage of the downturn to question
established orthodoxies can it emerge from the slump in a more competitive
state. The challenges and opportunities are immense, according to Mr Jonas.
'The profession is at a crossroads,' he says.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Outlook for jobs worsens: Biggest monthly fall on record in
manufacturing; Unemployment rate higher than EC average; Currency turmoil
hits optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISE last month of 32,200 in the jobless total overshadowed other gloomy
developments in the labour market.
Yesterday's detailed figures from the Department of Employment included a
string of other statistics which, taken together, suggest that the outlook
is worsening.
In the manufacturing sector alone, the number in work fell by 51,000, the
biggest monthly fall on record. Employment in that sector has now fallen by
238,000 since August last year compared with a drop of 378,000 in 1990. The
peak in manufacturing employment was in June 1971 when it was 8.6m. The
latest fall has reduced the total to 4.42m.
The male unemployment rate rose sharply last month. While the overall rate
rose to 10.1 per cent - the first time the rate has exceeded 10 per cent
since June 1987 - the rate of male unemployment reached 13.4 per cent, the
highest since May 1986. Female unemployment rose to 668,100 from 661,700, a
rate of 5.5 per cent.
According to the latest international comparisons of unemployment compiled
by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the
unemployment rate in the UK in August was 10 per cent. This is higher than
the EC average of 9.5 per cent.
Vacancies at Jobcentres, which account for about a third of all vacancies,
fell 11,900 last month to 95,000, the lowest figure since 1981. Falls in the
level tend to precede rises in unemployment, so the 11 per cent drop in just
one month suggest further big rises in unemployment are likely.
Equally worrying is an indication that the trend growth rate in unemployment
is accelerating. In the six months to September, the average rise in the
seasonally adjusted total of people out of work and claiming benefit rose by
31,800, compared with an average rise of 27,700 in the six months to August.
The only bright spot was on pay, with figures showing that the underlying
increase in average earnings in the year to August was 5.75 per cent
compared with 6 per cent in the year to July, the lowest rate of increase
for 25 years. The number of people unemployed and claiming benefit rose last
month in every region except Ulster. The biggest increases were in the
south-east and East Anglia.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Recession grips in Scotland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FULL effects of the recession have reached Scotland, the Fraser of
Allander Institute, Scotland's principal economic research organisation,
said yesterday.
It was commenting on the latest quarterly survey of Scottish business which
showed almost uniformly bad indicators of economic performance and business
confidence.
The survey, carried out by Scotland's chambers of commerce for the third
quarter of 1992, revealed that manufacturing companies were now experiencing
falls in sales and orders compared with a modest increase in the second
quarter.
Orders in the construction industry were declining at an even faster rate
than in the previous quarter. An upward trend in retail sales in the second
quarter had turned into a fall, and tourism businesses reported falling
demand.
Manufacturers in the survey were running down stocks, and most said they
were scaling down investment in new plant and machinery. A small majority in
the second quarter had been increasing investment.
Hopes voiced in the second quarter for an upturn in the next quarter had not
been fulfilled, and expectations for the fourth quarter were for a
performance little better than that for the third.
Mr Brian Ashcroft, director of the institute, said demand from the Scottish
market, which had previously held up while that from England had declined,
was tailing off.

FT  16 OCT 92 / CBI finds gloom across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON is not the only European capital suffering from a recession, the
Confederation of British Industry said yesterday after carrying out the
first pan-European business survey published since sterling's withdrawal
from the exchange rate mechanism on September 16.
The CBI's survey covered 2,500 companies in five European capitals and found
that confidence is low in London, Brussels, Paris and Rome, with gloom
spread across sectors. Activity in retailing, hotels, tourism and
construction has fallen, the CBI said.
According to the CBI, business optimism among manufacturers in the four
cities is also down. All are looking to reduce further their manufacturing
labour forces over the next six months. Madrid is the only centre expecting
a more encouraging outlook.
The survey suggests that manufacturing output and investment levels in
London may rise marginally, while production elsewhere is expected to
decline. Optimism in the banking and finance sector was generally lower in
the face of the continuing uncertainty surrounding the currency and equity
markets.
Construction appears to be the universal blackspot, with none of the cities
suggesting that an improvement in activity is likely. Optimism and
investment programmes remain at low levels.
The retail sector appears universally gloomy, with cons-umer confidence low
and staffing levels falling. London retailers say they are still affected by
consumer preference for paying off debt, while the downturn in the French
economy is now hitting retail spending in Paris.

FT  16 OCT 92 / More women graduates find work than men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of female graduates finding work within six months of graduation
exceeded the number of males for the first time last year.
Figures compiled by the Central Services Unit for Graduate Employment and
the Association of Graduate Careers Advisory Services show that although
women made up less than half the 135,000 graduates in the study, 31,359
women had found permanent or short-term work in the UK or overseas by
December last year compared with 31,273 men.
A 5.5 per cent increase in the total of graduates combined with a depressed
labour market left 11.5 per cent of graduates still unoccupied after six
months, up from 8.1 per cent in 1990.
The jobless rate for women graduates was 9.4 per cent and 13.4 per cent for
men.
Teacher training rose in popularity, with more than 5,000 graduates, 4.5 per
cent of the total, choosing it last year compared with 3.7 per cent in 1990.
Women continue to outnumber men in teacher training by more than two to one.
The figures were drawn from surveys carried out by universities,
polytechnics and colleges.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Upward trend of sales in north is reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP downturn in sales and confidence in northern England was reported
yesterday. Liverpool chamber of commerce, covering Merseyside, west Cheshire
and north Wales, reported a reversal between July and September of all
upward trends in home and export deliveries and orders.
Steep job losses are forecast for this quarter, with 29 per cent planning to
shed labour. That follows four successive quarters in which the trend of job
losses had stabilised. This quarter's plunge is forecast at a similar scale
to two years ago, when 35 per cent of companies in the Liverpool survey cut
jobs in the fourth quarter.
The pattern is similar to larger surveys by the Manchester-centred
north-west chambers and the Leeds-collated chambers for Yorkshire and
Humberside. The only indicator not in negative balance - more companies
reporting a decrease than an increase - is for export orders, but even here
the figure is zero after being positive last year. The Hotpoint washing
machine factory at Llandudno Junction, north Wales, is to close with the
loss of 100 jobs.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Republicans may decline to 40
seats in Senate : Many more women will enter Congress, says George Graham
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Congress will take office in January. It is already sure to wear a
face very different from that of its predecessor. One member in six is not
standing for re-election on November 3. A handful of House of
Representatives members has switched to run for the Senate, but most of the
departures are caused by retirement or by defeat in primaries.
The Republicans' anticipation that this wholesale change would present an
opportunity to break the Democrats' domination of Congress is being rapidly
evaporated. A year ago, Republican organisers had hoped that, in the Senate,
where 36 of the 100 seats are at stake in the election, they might be able
to break the Democrats' 57:43 majority.
Today, the Republicans face the ominous prospect of falling as low as 40, a
critical level because it would give the Democrats the 60-member majority
required to shut off debate through a 'cloture' motion, so depriving the
Republicans of the ability to block legislation by filibustering.
Democrats are strongly placed to gain two seats, in California and
Wisconsin, and have reasonable prospects of ousting Republican incumbents in
at least two more states, New York and Oregon. Pollsters give the
Republicans only an outside chance of picking up two Democratic seats, in
Ohio and North Carolina.
In the House, where members are elected for only two years rather than the
six-year Senate term, the Republicans hoped to gain from the 10-yearly
redrawing of congressional district boundaries to take account of new census
data.
Re-districting alone had been projected to cost the majority Democrats
perhaps up to 40 of their total 266 seats. Besides faster population growth
in Republican areas, and the likely undoing of some of the more egregious
gerrymanders of 1982, new court interpretations of the Voting Rights Act
compelled the creation of more districts with predominantly minority
populations.
This has resulted in the drawing of some overwhelmingly Democratic
districts, but left the Republicans stronger in many others by siphoning off
black voters, who remain, for the most part, strongly Democratic. The
Democrats are still likely to lose seats, but the Republicans have been
declining rapidly. Mr Charles Cook, a respected election handicapper, last
week forecast a 16-seat gain for the Republicans, which would give the
Democrats control of the House with 252 seats to 182 for the Republicans,
with one Independent.
Congress's reputation with US voters has been unusually low over the last
year. Mounting public concern over the huge federal budget deficit has
focused unfavourable attention on Congressional spending habits. Many
legislators, too, became disillusioned and retired. They range from such
familiar figures as Senator Warren Rudman, co-author of the Gramm-Rudman
legislation that tried vainly to curb the budget deficit in the 1980s, to
such promising youngsters as Congressman Dennis Eckart of Ohio.
Voters who for years had split their votes between Republican presidents and
Democratic Congress memebers, and showed every sign of liking the idea of
divided government, began to complain about Washington gridlock, a complaint
that President George Bush tried to exploit in his re-election campaign.
Mr Bush's pitch does not appear to have worked; indeed, if the gridlock is
to be broken, it now appears far more likely to come about by ending
Republican control of the White House than by ending Democratic control of
Capitol Hill. Many Republican Congressional candidates are painfully aware
of this, and are busily trying to distance their own candidacies from the
top of their party's ticket. The Washington Post reported this week that
only two dozen of more than 400 Republican Congressional candidates had
accepted an offer to be seen with the president on their campaign
advertisements.
One maverick factor in the congressional elections is the revived popularity
of Mr Ross Perot. Although few believe that he still has a realistic chance
of the presidency, he could bring to the ballot box many who are inclined to
vote systematically against the incumbent, of whatever party. That could
lead to an even more extensive turnover in Congressional membership.
Whatever happens, the new members are already certain to include a great
many more women. The new Senate could boast as many as seven female members,
more than double the current tally; in the House, the number of women
members should rise by at least 12 from the present 29. But all the new
members may not serve as long as their predecessors. Voters in 14 states
will have the chance to take part in referendums on whether to limit the
number of terms a legislator may serve.
Colorado has already introduced such limits, but a ballot measure in
Washington state was narrowly defeated last year, thanks in large part to
the campaigning of Mr Tom Foley, Speaker of the House and representative of
eastern Washington since 1965. Term limits now seem to be winning support of
about 70 per cent in most states where the issue is on the ballot.

GEORGE BUSH
Defence: Proposes real 4 per cent decline in defence budget 1993-97, with
steady reductions in troop levels to 'base force' with 12 active army
divisions, 12 carrier battle groups and 15.25 fighter wing equivalents.
Seeks 150,000 troops in Europe. Wants to kill off Seawolf submarine, Osprey
aircraft. Backs development of GPALS anti-missile defences.
Abortion: Would ban abortion except in cases of rape, incest or threat to
woman's life. Has repeatedly vetoed bills including federal funding for
abortions or abortion counselling.
Environment: Helped enact Clean Air Act but has held up some rules
implementing act. Wants more attention paid to economic cost of
environmental protection.
Healthcare: Proposes tax credits worth dollars 1,250 per person to help
cover most of those without health insurance. Seeks reforms to workings of
insurance market. Encourages health maintenance organisations.
Trade: Seeks to help create domestic jobs by expanding exports. Has
negotiated Nafta agreement with Canada and Mexico. Seeks similar free trade
agreements in future with other countries in Latin America and eastern
Europe.
Economy
Offers a continuation of Republican Party strategies of past 12 years.
Underlying philosophy is that free markets, low taxes and minimal government
regulation provide best prospect of rapid economic growth and higher living
standards. Thus promises a new round of tax cuts, to be offset by
unspecified cuts in federal spending.
Emphasises the importance of cuts in capital gains taxes as a way of
stimulating private investment and favours short-term incentives to
revitalise the economy, such as tax credits for first-time home buyers and
targeted investment subsidies.
Advocates an amendment ot the Constitution mandating a balanced federal
budget.
Also seeks to strengthen the economy through market-oriented social reforms,
such as the promotion of greater competition to control health care costs
and raise educational standards and the creation of tax-free 'enterprise
zones' to regenerate inner cities. However, the ideas are mostly a late
response to Democratic Party proposals.
BILL CLINTON
Defence: Seeks to maintain strong military, cutting dollars 60bn from Bush's
five-year dollars 1,420bn defence budget. Aims for slightly lower force
levels, mainly by cutting to around 100,000 troops in Europe. Backs
completion of Seawolf and development of Osprey.
Abortion: Supports right to safe, legal abortion, but wants to reduce the
number of abortions. 'Children should not have children.'
Environment: Favours limiting carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by
year 2000 to fight global warming. Supports higher fuel efficiency standards
for cars, more protection for wetlands, old growth forests. Tones down
environmentalist message of his running mate Al Gore.
Healthcare: Plans national health spending caps and universal coverage.
Employers would either provide private insurance or pay into state-run
scheme. Every American guaranteed a basic health benefits package.
Trade: Wants to 'move aggressively to open foreign markets', calling for
stronger 'Super 301' trade bill,  Endorses Nafta, but wants additional job
and environmental protections.
Economy
Advocates a change of economic course involving a greater commitment to
investment in people, a more active role for government and a fairer tax
system.
Supports free enterprise but argues that government can do more to create a
favourable climate for growth. Proposes an additional dollars 200bn of
federal investment in education, training and infrastructure over the next
four years, a more active industrial policy to facilitate the switch from
defence to civilian production, and bold reforms of the health care and
welfare systems.
Advocates modest tax cuts for middle-income families as a way of
compensating for tax cuts that favoured the rich in the 1980s. Would pay for
these reforms by raising taxes on the top 2 per cent of earners, by clamping
down on tax avoidance by foreign companies and by cutting inessential
federal spending. Has pledged to halve budget deficit by 1996.
Critics say the plan lacks fiscal realism and envisages too big a role for
government. Higher taxes on top earners and foreign companies are unlikely
to yield as much revenue as projected, while social reforms - such as
guaranteed health insurance for all - may prove more costly than expected.
ROSS PEROT
Defence: Wants to cut at least dollars 40bn from Bush defence budget over
next five years, eliminating 'relics from the Cold War' like the B2 bomber
and Seawolf. Wants Europe and Asia to pay dollars 100bn more of the cost of
collective security.
Abortion: Supports woman's right to choose. Backs federal funding of
abortions for poor women, but also for education and counselling to reduce
unwanted pregnancies.
Environment: Favours economic incentives rather than regulations to achieve
environmental goals. Wants to end subsidies for inefficient and
environmentally destructive mining and logging activities. Would raise
petrol tax by 10 cents a year for next five years.
Healthcare: Wants short term cost containment and preventitive medicine
programme. Seeks national health board to oversee long-term reform,
including universal coverage.
Trade: Wants to end distinction between the 'high' politics of defence and
diplomacy and the 'low' politics of the economy and jobs. Would put
'experienced, hard-nosed negotiators from outside politics' as trade
negotiators.
Economy
Plan assumes big federal deficits are the root cause of US economic problems
and proposes, unlike other candidates, swingeing cuts in spending and
increases in taxes - enough, he hopes, to eliminate the deficit by 1998.
Theory is that tough action to reduce the deficit would raise the national
savings rate, allow more capital investment and thus boost productivity
growth and living standards.
Asks all sections of society to make sacrifices. The rich would have to pay
higher rates of income tax and face a cap on mortgage interest deductions.
Working families would face sharp increases in petrol and tobacco taxes.
Many elderly people would have to pay more for federal health care and face
higher taxes on pensions. Employer health schemes would be taxed more.
Would increase spending on a few budget items, including research and
development and investment incentives. Overall budget savings estimated at
about dollars 750bn over five years.
Many economists have applauded the tough measures to regain control of the
federal budget, although some fear that deficit reduction at this speed
would risk plunging the economy into a slump.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Wall Street convinced Clinton will
triumph - Picking out likely winners and losers if the Democrats are elected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT may have taken them a long time to come round to the idea of a President
Clinton, but Wall Street's economists, analysts and fund managers are now
convinced that the Democrat governor from Arkansas will triumph on November
3.
According to a survey published this week in Barron's, the US business
newspaper, a remarkable 70 per cent of the investment fund managers it
surveyed believe the Democrat would win the presidency next month. There is
an equally firm consensus among economists and analysts about the election's
outcome.
Now that Wall Street believes Mr Clinton will win, there has been a scramble
to identify the financial assets that could benefit most from a
Democratic-controlled White House.
On a macro level, economists expect that the economic pendulum will swing
from deflation to higher growth and inflation under Mr Clinton, and are
warning investors to be ready to make a significant asset-allocation
decision; to switch from bonds to stocks.
Mr Steven Resnick, senior investment strategist at Cowen, a New York
securities firm, believes strongly that stocks will do better than bonds:
'Clinton means more reflation than we would have got with Bush - it will be
the turning point in the bull market for bonds.'
Few doubt that stocks would outperform bonds in a reflationary climate,
especially given the bond market's aversion to any policy that might widen
the budget deficit. Most economists on Wall Street mistrust the calculations
behind Mr Clinton's formula for halving the deficit over four years - a
formula based on increasing spending, cutting middle class taxes, raising
taxes on the rich, closing corporate tax loopholes, cutting defence spending
and reducing government waste. To bond investors, the formula spells higher
interest rates and higher inflation.
To some extent, these fears have already been priced into bonds, which have
fallen recently on concerns about Clintonomics. Most observers, however,
believe the market would drop further after the election on a Democratic
victory, and forecasters talk of long-term bond yields rising from 7.5 per
cent levels to well above 8 per cent.
The stock market has already been shedding some fat in anticipation of a
Clinton win, based primarily on the instinctive judgment that Republicans
are better for equities than Democrats. Political discounting was partly to
blame for the 120-point drop in the Dow over six trading days last week.
Apart from this the market appears to be approaching the idea of a Clinton
presidency calmly. As with the voters, the mood among many investors is more
anti-Bush than pro-Clinton. 'There's a high degree of frustration with Bush
 -he's not exactly beloved in the market,' says Mr David Shulman, senior
equity strategist at Salomon Brothers.
Despite that frustration Wall Street's underlying sympathies remain with the
Republicans. If Mr Bush did manage to come back off the ropes to win there
would be a collective sigh of relief at the survival of the status quo.
If Mr Clinton wins, Wall Street assumes that the new administration,
probably supported by a Democrat-controlled Congress, will try to accomplish
its main goal - kick-starting the stalled economic recovery  - in its first
100 days.
That would involve giving early priority to boosting public expenditure. In
such an environment, with Mr Clinton proposing spending an extra Dollars
133bn (Pounds 77.3bn) over four years on roads, bridges and trains, analysts
recommend investing in companies that benefit from infrastructure spending.
Likely beneficiaries of increased spending on public works at federal and
state level include big machinery makers such as Caterpillar and Ingersoll
Rand, and steel companies. Road builders such as Trinity Industries, Granite
Construction and Kasler could also benefit, as could Manitowoc, which makes
cranes used in the building of bridges, tunnels and port facilities.
Telecommunications companies would gain if the Democrats go ahead with their
plans to establish a 'fibre-optic super-highway' across the US to link
homes, business, laboratories and classrooms in a national information
network. DSC Communications, the country's leading supplier of signalling
equipment and the preferred vendor to both local and long distance
telecommunications companies, has been widely mentioned by analysts.
Wall Street believes the educational infrastructure should benefit from Mr
Clinton's plans to spend Dollars 63bn over four years. Analysts
recommendations have included McGraw-Hill and Paramount Communications
(owner of Simon &amp; Schuster), two big textbook publishers, and Apple
Computer, which dominates the educational computer market.
The sorry state of the nation's health-care system has been a big issue in
the campaign, and healthcare companies and hospital management companies,
such as US Healthcare and Hospital Staffing Services, should benefit from
Democratic plans for more comprehensive healthcare provision.
Among retailers, those that service lower- and middle-income shoppers are
expected to gain from middle-class tax cuts. Wal-Mart, Kmart, Costco and
Woolworths are three such stocks. Conversely, higher taxes on the rich might
adversely affect the likes of Tiffany's and Nieman Marcus, which is owned by
General Cinema.
Environmental stocks are widely regarded as good buys with Mr Albert Gore,
one of the most environmentally-savvy politicians in the US, as
vice-president. Groundwater Technology and Handex Environmental Recovery
have been singled out, as have natural gas suppliers such as Global Marine
and Oceaneering International.
But what about the stocks to avoid if Mr Clinton wins? In the most obvious
cases, such as the pharmaceutical companies like Merck, Pfizer and Johnson &amp;
Johnson that could suffer from controls on pharmaceutical prices, heavy
selling in recent weeks has already taken the sting out of a possible
Clinton victory.
Defence stocks, in the light of the Democrat's more aggressive defence cuts
plans, have also been discounted, hitting names like Lockheed, Northrop and
Rockwell International.
One other stock singled out by many as a Clinton loser is Tyco Toys. Mr
Clinton has hinted he may remove the 'most-favoured nation' trade status
accorded to China if its human rights record is not improved. Tyco is
vulnerable because 40 per cent of its products are reported to be made in
China.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Bush election cruise sails
perilously near the rocks - Why lack of strategy helped to undermine the
President's re-election battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWELVE months ago, it did not appear that President George Bush would need
much strategy to win re-election. Riding high in the opinion polls after the
military and diplomatic triumphs of the Gulf War, with reasonable
predictions of economic recovery for 1992, and with the leading lights of
the Democratic Party unwilling to take him on, he could have been excused
for anticipating a leisure cruise to a second term.
When things first began to go awry - the Senate by-election loss in
Pennsylvania last November, the disastrous trip to Japan in January and the
general emergence from the warm Gulf hangover - Mr Bush and his advisers
still seemed more puzzled than worried. Then along came Mr Pat Buchanan and
his right-wing insurgency.
Mr Bush seemed torn between a compulsion to compete with Mr Buchanan for
President Reagan's right-wing cohorts, who had helped him to victory in
1988, and treating the polemicist with presidential disdain while
proclaiming the virtues of the middle ground. Though never a real threat for
the Republican nomination, Mr Buchanan succeeded in preventing Mr Bush from
staking out any kind of early strategic position beyond proclamation of his
experience.
In contrast, Governor Bill Clinton's long run always had a consistent
strategic purpose. Still pinned to the board in his Little Rock war-room is
the slogan 'the economy, stupid' - an admonition to the candidate and his
campaign never to swerve from this central issue.
From the very beginning, there was a proliferation of position papers on
every known social and economic policy subject. Mr Paul Tsongas, with some
temporary success, was equally explicit.
The second string was an equally clear determination to rid the Democratic
Party of its left-wing baggage to make it more acceptable to the white and
suburban vote that had gone Republican in droves during the last three
elections.
This meant not only winning primaries but also handling the traditional
party power bases, organised labour and the Rev Jesse Jackson, the black
leader, in such a way as to make it clear that the candidate was beholden to
neither.
Simultaneously, as Mr Bush's team of advisers was increasingly seen
bickering - with Mr Sam Skinner making a hash of the pivotal post of White
House chief of staff - the Clinton core was toughened and united by the
adversity of all the stories about the candidate's private life.
Amid the debate over Vice-President Dan Quayle's presence on the Republican
ticket, Mr Clinton defied the conventional wisdom by choosing Senator Al
Gore, a man of his own age and beliefs and from the same part of the
country.
Consistency was successfully portrayed as a virtue and the Democratic
convention in New York in July was a display case for the candidate's
centrism, run with an efficiency once typical of Republicans.
Mr Ross Perot streaked across the springtime political sky, potentially
upsetting all political calculations. But he disappeared abruptly in July,
only to resurface with a month to go. An eye-catching performance in the
first debate has reignited interest in his independent candidacy, but almost
certainly not to the point that he could win the White House.
The sudden surge from last to first by Mr Clinton in July put the Bush
campaign very much on the strategic spot, not least because Mr Clinton
refused to sit on his new lead. The immensely successful post-convention bus
tours of the mid-west and the farm belt preserved momentum at precisely the
time four years before that Mr Michael Dukakis took a holiday and squandered
his.
If New York in July was Mr Clinton's apex, Houston in August was Mr Bush's
nadir. Patently needing to reclaim the middle ground, his campaign allowed
the far right to dominate the convention with its exclusionary dogma.
Mr Bush may actually have given a better acceptance address than Mr Clinton
a month before, but the messages from Houston were dominated by the
apocalyptic warnings of religious, social and cultural wars pouring from the
mouths of Mr Buchanan, the Rev Pat Robertson and Mrs Marilyn Quayle.
Deprived of a convention 'bounce,' Mr James Baker, back in the White House
saddle, was left pretty much devising strategy from scratch. Initially, this
involved some serious attempts to differentiate the president's economic
philosophies from Mr Clinton's but, as this too failed to take hold, the
approach became progressively negative, first with assaults on Mr Clinton's
record in Arkansas and later with the scarcely veiled suggestions that he
was unpatriotic and even a coward.
Even some traditional Republican advantages - such as finance - became less
overwhelming. Both candidates receive equal federal funding (about Dollars
55m each), but the Democrats normally find it harder to raise money from
individual and corporate contributions. However, they raised Dollars 43.5m
from July to September, and the Republicans only Dollars 26.7m. This still
left the Republicans with a cumulative edge of Dollars 96.2m to Dollars
69.8m, but it means Mr Clinton has not been short of funds in the home
stretch, where it matters.
The electoral map has also begun to look less lopsided. The last three
Republican victories were based on dominance south of the Mason-Dixon line
and west of the Mississippi, with a reasonable split elsewhere. The
Democratic choice of Mr Clinton, a border southerner, threw down a gauntlet
in the Republican heartland.
Mr Bush has never been very popular in California, carrying it only narrowly
in 1988. Now it seems long gone, Texas and the deep south look fragile and
the mountain states, with their own brand of rugged independence, are
unpredictable. Thus, Mr Bush must do much better than he had any reason to
hope in the industrial mid-west in order to have a chance. That is a part of
the country where, as in California, the recession has bitten most deeply.
The US is now a very fragmented electoral market and endorsements matter
much less than they used to. Voter participation remains low, especially
among minorities, which tends to help Republicans. This year only Mr Perot
can be said to have generated real enthusiasm, but, with the possible
exception of the Christian right, it is the Democrats who have been
conducting the more effective registration drives.
Also, while holding on to liberal Democratic constituencies, Mr Clinton has
secured some transfers of allegiance from the traditionally solid Republican
corporate sector on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley.
Powerful lobbies, such as the National Rifle Association and the various
ex-servicemen's groups, have been less public in support of Mr Bush than is
usual. One, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, made the firing of a cabinet
member a condition for its backing. Mr Bush's refusal to go the last mile in
supporting the Brady bill, controlling hand-gun sales, led to a very belated
and lukewarm endorsement from the leading police officers' association.
There is a widespread assumption that the largest single voting bloc - women
 -has sharply turned against the president, because of his opposition to
abortion, family leave and other issues of importance to women, not least
the provision of economic opportunity. It is not a coincidence that, of the
record number of 11 women running for the Senate this year, 10 are
Democrats.
Mr Clinton's identification with local Democratic candidates seems much
closer than Mr Bush's to Republicans. In states like California and
Illinois, with popular women Senate candidates, the benefit to Mr Clinton
may be considerable.
In general, the prevalent anti-incumbent mood does not now seem to threaten
Democratic control of Congress and Mr Bush's attempt to blame everything on
the those running the legislature simply has not taken hold.
With 57 current Senate seats, the Democrats are now openly talking of ending
up with at least 60, which happens to be the majority needed to invoke
'cloture' and push legislation through. There will be many new faces in
Congress - perhaps more than in any post-war election - but their party
loyalties and their legislative agendas remain obscure.
The ultimate Republican tactical weapon has been to try and repeat the
success wrought by negative advertising in 1988. Mr Clinton is, on personal
grounds, an unusually vulnerable presidential candidate. But what worked
four years ago has been less effective this year.
The Conservative Party's campaign tactics in Britain this spring have been
the model for the Bush Republicans, but it is not always automatic that
political tactics import easily.
In particular the absence of the late Mr Lee Atwater has deprived Mr Bush's
effort of an instinct for the jugular.
In the last analysis, however, the strategic and tactical factors cannot by
themselves win an election if the country has lost sympathy with the
character of a candidate, incumbent or otherwise, or if the great common
denominator, the economy, has turned sour.
This was the great lesson of 1980, which 1992 in many respects now
resembles.

THE BATTLE FOR ELECTORAL COLLEGE VOTES
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The West
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton leads not only in traditionally Democratic states like
Washington and Oregon, and in more marginal Colorado, but even in the
Republican stronghold of Arizona, which gave Bush more than 60 per cent
of its votes in 1988. Most importantly, the economic recession in
California appears to have given Clinton an unassailable lead in this
state with the most electoral weight in the US.

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Midwest
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bush campaigners have all but given up hope in Illinois, and Clinton
also appears comfortably ahead in the Great Lakes industrial states of
Michigan, Ohio, Minnesota and Wisconsin. In conservative Indiana, and
out on the praries of Nebraska, Bush retains a lead, but even Kansas, so
heavily Republican that it is usually left out of presidential
calculations, is leaning to Clinton.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Minnesota            10
Missouri             11

 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The South
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
While the South continues to vote Democratic in congressional elections,
its presidential votes have been solidly Republican in recent years.
But southerners Clinton and Gore stand to win their home states,
Arkansas and Tennessee respectively. They also hold leads in Georgia,
Kentucky and even in North Carolina. Bush is fighting to hold Texas and
Florida.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Arkansas              6
Tennessee            11

Kentucky              8

Virginia             13
South Carolina        8
Florida (25) and Oklahoma (8) - too close to predict.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton leads        17
Clinton inclined     35
Bush leads            0
Bush inclined        78
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The East
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Liberal New York and Massachusetts remain firmly in the Clinton camp,
but the Democratic candidate has also won leads in Delaware, Maine and
New Jersey, which gave more than 55 per cent of their votes to Bush in
1988. Even New Hampshire, deeply conservative but one of the states
hardest hit by the recession, has deserted Bush. Clinton could sweep
through the entire region.
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton leads
Maine                 4
Vermont               3
Massachusetts        12
Connecticut           8
Rhode Island          4
New York             33
Pennsylvania         23
New Jersey           15
Maryland             10
West Virginia         5
Dist. of Columbia     3
Clinton inclined
Delaware              3
New Hampshire         4
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Bush leads            0
Bush inclined         0
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton leads       120
Clinton inclined      7
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Clinton landslide?
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
If the states vote on November 3 as these polls suggest they could,
Clinton would take at least 36 states plus the District of Columbia,
with Bush winning in only 11 to 14 states. This would translate into a
landslide in terms of the 538 electoral college votes.
Excludes Florida, Oklahoma &amp; N. Dakota as too close to predict.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: College result likely to look
sweeping - David Butler sees little possibility of a John Major factor
rescuing George Bush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE vagaries of the Electoral College make presidential elections seem more
decisive than they really are. Even in the closest of the 12 post-war
contests, the winner was a clear 57 ahead in the 538-member electoral
college.
On average, the margin of victory has been 267 - a landslide of more than
two to one. This has been in spite of the fact that the average lead in the
popular vote has been less then 10 per cent and that there have been four
close calls out of the last 12 races - in 1948, 1960, 1968 and 1976.
The reason lies in the surprising uniformity of electoral behaviour in the
US. In 1988, only Utah and the District of Columbia were more than 10 per
cent away from the national result.
More important, seven of the eight largest states had a vote that was within
3 per cent of the national figure. To adapt the old Maine adage - as one
state goes, so go the rest.
However, the fact that the votes in each state are always cast en bloc means
that the candidates focus their attention on the large states. The three
electoral college votes of Delaware or Wyoming are most unlikely to decide
the outcome. But the 54 votes of California or the 32 of Texas could easily
settle a close race.
The electoral college does offer the possibility of a perverse result. In
1876 and 1888, the candidate with fewer votes won. It would always be
theoretically possible for a candidate who lost in half the states by large
margins, and won the rest by a hair's breadth, to win with only 40 per cent
of the popular vote. But the law of averages rules that out.
In recent elections, anyone who secured 49 per cent of the popular vote
could be assured of a majority in the electoral college - even though there
does seem to be a slight Republican bias in the system: 49.5 per cent of the
popular vote would usually have given victory to their candidate. However
the chances of the loser in the popular vote emerging as president are very
small.
The US is thought to have two-party politics. But, in every recent election,
ten or more presidential candidates have been on the ballot, ranging from
Liberation to Communist.
This year the Mahareshi's Natural Law party has joined the gaggle of
no-hopers who together will share less than 1 per cent of the vote. However,
in the half century before Ross Perot's interventon there have been four
third party candidates who have been taken seriously, at least as spoilers.
In 1948, Harry Truman faced rebellion both from the Dixiecrat right of his
party and from the fellow-travelling left. In 1968, George Wallace offered
the most substantial of segregationist challenges and, in 1980, John
Anderson supplied an honourable centrist alternative to the inadequacies of
the major party contenders.
But all these attempts to buck the system faded as the campaign advanced,
bringing the real choice to the voters.
In theory, the Perot intervention could decide the 1992 election; in
practice this is most improbable. On current opinion polls Perot will not
top 10 per cent - 5 per cent is probably nearer the mark. His votes will be
drawn from both sides, hurting Bush more in the South (particularly in Texas
and Florida) and Clinton more in California and some of the industrial
states.
However, the net difference in any state is unlikely to exceed 2 or 3 per
cent; since it will work both ways, the chances of its being decisive
nationally are very low.
Inside the Beltway at least, Republicans are looking to the British analogy.
They are imitating the Conservative tax advertisements of last March and
they are dreaming of the late surge that, it is alleged, snatched victory
for John Major from the jaws of defeat.
They also hope that the opinion polls may be as systematically erroneous
across the US as they proved to be in the UK.
There is little evidence to support such wishful thinking. The veteran
George Bush is not not the new arrived John Major. The historical baggage of
the Democrats is much lighter than that carried by the British Labour Party.
Late swings can happen. In 1948, it seems, one did save Harry Truman. In
1980, another gave Ronald Reagan his landslide.
Therefore, with 19 days to go this year, the pundits are keeping their
fingers crossed. But, at the moment, there is nothing in the opinion polls -
and certainly nothing in the electoral system - which can offer substantial
comfort to the Republicans who want to believe that George Bush can pull off
a John Major.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Race for the White House: Perot defies history books

<TEXT>
ROSS PEROT is not a typical independent, or third-party, presidential
candidate.
He springs from no party, cannot be said to have created his own other than
informally, did not hold a convention and has no defined regional base,
other than possibly in Texas - all characteristics of most of those who have
previously sought to upset the establishment applecart.
There is always a small multitude of such candidacies on the ballot. Mr
Perot is on the ballot in every state, as is Mr Andre Marrou of the
Libertarian party, a fixture in almost every state since 1976. Others have
qualified in less than the full complement.
The most successful this century was that of Theodore Roosevelt, the former
Republican president, in 1912. His Progressive, or Bull Moose, party won 27
per cent of the popular vote, behind Woodrow Wilson's just under 42 per cent
but ahead of the official Republican candidate, William Taft, with 23 per
cent. He carried six states and won 88 electoral college votes, compared
with Mr Wilson's 435 and Mr Taft's eight.
In 1924 Robert Lafollette, a former Democrat also under the Progressive
banner, pulled in over 16 per cent, but carried only his native Wisconsin.
In 1968, Governor George Wallace of Alabama, also a former Democrat, headed
the American Independent party, got 13.5 per cent of the vote and carried
five southern states with 46 electoral college votes.
In 1948 Strom Thurmond, campaigning as a States Rights Democrat, but later a
Republican, won only 2.4 per cent of the popular vote but won four southern
states and 39 electors. Henry Wallace, FDR's vice president from 1941-45 and
the Progressive candidate that year, got only 12,000 fewer votes, but won no
state.
In 1980 John Anderson, the former Republican congressman and official
Independent, scored 6.6 per cent but won no state.
No third party or independent has taken the presidency, but both Theodore
Roosevelt and George Wallace won enough to determine who did, since both had
been identified with one of the two main parties.
Though the electoral college margins were wider, Wilson's 41.84 per cent and
Richard Nixon's 43.42 per cent in 1968 are the lowest popular vote scores
for a successful candidate this century. John Anderson hurt Jimmy Carter in
1980, but not enough to bridge the gap with Ronald Reagan.
Most independent candidacies wither as election day approaches. Mr Anderson,
for example, once enjoyed 20 per cent-plus ratings in midsummer opinion
polls.
But history again is no useful guide in assessing Mr Perot because he
started to run, then quit, and only got back in with a month to go.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Bargain-bin stocks disappear from stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT FAR from the cut-price knitted cardigans and the racks of unfashionable
coats, the Nomura Securities counter at the Daimaru department store in
downtown Osaka has its own specials - stocks at three-year lows and entire
sectors at heavy discounts to the market average.
But Japanese wanting to shop for stocks in a department store had better
hurry. The Nomura outlet in Daimaru will close next month, and other brokers
are closing their counters as rapidly as they were opened in the late 1980s.
Yamaichi Securities, one of Japan's Big Four brokers, opened 10 'sales
offices', as distinct from branches, after the finance ministry agreed in
1985 that a department store or railway station was an appropriate place for
a securities counter. Yamaichi has closed all 10 this year.
Another of the Big Four, Daiwa Securities, has closed three department store
offices in the past two months and has seven sales offices left. Nomura's 20
sales offices will be reduced to 14 by the end of next month, and the rest
are under review after a first half in which none of Japan's 14 leading
brokers expects to report a profit.
The 'sales offices' were a way around finance ministry restrictions on the
opening of branches, and were able to operate as long as the department
store was open. One drawback was the expense of installing an electronic
stock board and computer equipment, but, more importantly, the ministry
'guided' the brokers to limit their sales activities.
Ministry officials insisted that the staff, unlike branch employees, could
not knock on doors in the local district. Store-based brokers were also told
not to sell 'risky or speculative products', such as options and futures.
'We thought the customers would come to us, but they didn't,' a Nomura
planning manager said. The broker found that the shoppers who wanted to talk
stocks or bonds were already Nomura customers, while other potential clients
were intimidated by the open-plan style of the stores and wanted more
privacy when talking about personal finance.
These outlets were further bruised when ordinary Japanese, already made wary
by falling prices, became reluctant to purchase stocks after the surfacing
of several scandals, including that of brokers' links to gangsters and the
compensation of corporate clients for stock losses.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Canadians address deepening divisions: A look at the jitters
over an imminent referendum on proposed constitutional reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Canada signed its landmark free-trade agreement with the US four years
ago, the country's business leaders were among the deal's loudest
cheerleaders.
Many distributed pro-free trade literature to their employees, urging them
to back prime minister Brian Mulroney's Conservative government in the 1988
general election.
Four years later, Canadian business is again in the forefront of a political
campaign - this time urging a Yes vote in the October 26 referendum on the
most far-reaching package of constitutional reforms since the country was
formed in 1867.
However, in contrast to their enthusiasm for the free-trade pact, most
captains of industry are lukewarm about the contents of the constitutional
deal, known as the Charlottetown Agreement. The main thrust of their
arguments is to warn of the dire economic consequences if voters reject the
agreement.
The prospect of a No victory has already unsettled investors. It is widely
blamed for the slump in the Canadian dollar over the past month, from 83 US
cents to less than 80 cents, and the consequent two percentage-point jump in
banks' prime lending rate.
The gap between short-term Canadian and US rates has widened in the past
month from 1.5 to about five percentage points. Standard &amp; Poors, the US
rating agency, cited political jitters as one reason for downgrading
Canada's foreign currency debt this week.
But, with only two weeks before the referendum and opinion polls putting the
No side well ahead in several provinces, business leaders are also anxious
not to paint too bleak a picture of Canada's future if the agreement is
rejected at the polls.
Mr Tom D'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, which
represents 150 chief executives of Canada's biggest companies, says: 'At the
very least, we expect there will be a period of uncertainty which may be
quite long.'
More than a quarter of small businesses polled by the Canadian Federation of
Independent Business said it will cut investment or make other changes in
their planning if the No side prevails.
But Mr D'Aquino's message to foreign investors in the event of a No vote is:
'Put everything in context and don't panic.' He raises the possibility that
'constitutional fatigue' could put Canada's perennial identity crisis out of
people's minds, as it did after Quebec's sovereignty referendum 12 years
ago.
Mr Guy Saint-Pierre, chairman of SNC, Canada's biggest project management
group, and a leading campaigner for the agreement in Quebec, says that his
concern arises less from the immediate fall-out from the referendum than
from Canada's long-term future.
'It won't be heaven or hell the next day,' Mr Saint-Pierre says. But he
predicts that a No vote would embolden Quebec separatists to demand an early
election in the francophone province. If they win, and remain true to their
principles, Mr Saint-Pierre fears that Quebec could find itself on an
inexorable road to sovereignty.
Royal Bank of Canada, the country's biggest financial institution, concluded
in a lengthy analysis last month that a break-up of Canada would push the
average growth rate down from 3 per cent to 1 per cent a year over the next
decade and raise unemployment.
In the event of a break-up, the bank said, 'a significant widening in the
income gap between Canada and the US could turn the current flow of
emigrants into a flood.'
The business community remains optimistic that the Yes forces, which were
slow to get their campaign into gear, can make up lost ground over the next
two weeks. Most polls point to a large pool of undecided voters. Backers of
the pact are hoping these will be swayed by warnings of lower growth,
falling living standards and a broken country.
They are hammering home the point that opponents of the deal - who include
such uneasy bedfellows as Quebec separatists, western Canadian regional
groups, women's activists and former prime minister Mr Pierre Trudeau, an
arch-federalist - would never be able to strike a deal themselves.
But supporters of the constitutional reforms, and especially the business
community, have yet to muster the fervour of the critics. Because the
agreement is a compromise, which gives no region or interest group
everything it wants, it has been easy for opponents to pick apart.
Quebec separatists have plenty of ammunition to show that the francophone
province got less at the bargaining table than it had wanted.
The business community is genuinely troubled by some provisions of the
Charlottetown Agreement.
Sections recognising the 'inherent right' of Canada's 700,000 aboriginal
people to self-government could prove a headache for fishing, mining and
forestry companies.
They face the prospect of dealing with another level of government, able to
pass laws without necessarily using normal democratic processes.
Business is also disappointed that the federal government backed down in the
closing stages of negotiations from earlier demands that the ten provinces
make a firm commitment to lower their myriad non-tariff trade barriers.
Mr Jim Matkin, the president of the Business Council of British Columbia,
says that such concerns mean that business lobby groups cannot push the
Charlottetown Agreement as hard as free trade without risking the
displeasure of their members.
Mr Matkin says his reservations about the agreement are outweighed by his
concern at Quebec's reaction to a No vote.
Echoing a line of Mr Mulroney, in rallying support for the Yes side, Mr
Matkin calls the Charlottetown deal 'as good as we can expect - and we can't
let the perfect be the enemy of the good.'
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
HIGHLIGHTS OF CANADA'S NEW CONSTITUTION
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
An elected Senate, with six senators from each province, plus one each
from two Arctic territories.

ratified by the Senate.
The House of Commons to be expanded from 295 to 337 seats, with extra
seats for Ontario and Quebec (18 each), British Columbia (4) and
Alberta (2).
Quebec to gain the right 'to preserve and promote' its distinct
identity.
Provinces to acquire exclusive jurisdiction in forestry, mining,
tourism and housing; and wider powers over immigration, labour, training
and culture.
Aboriginal people to gain an 'inherent right' to self-government,
enforceable by the courts after five years.

A big military ammunition depot explodes yesterday near the international

the 16-year civil war, Reuter reports. Three soldiers of the former rebel
movement Unita have been blamed for causing the blast by firing shells at
the depot, according to Angolan radio.
Meanwhile, Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita leader, is expected to fly to Luanda
today for talks with President Jose Eduardo dos Santos aimed at averting
renewed civil war. South Africa has made an aircraft available to fly Mr
Savimbi from his stronghold of Huambo. Mr Savimbi said final results of last

votes and a run-off ballot would be held between the two men. He renewed his
accusation that there was fraud in the elections.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Gore leads attack on foreign policy
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's Democratic challengers are trying to turn the tables
on some of his proudest achievements in the foreign policy arena.
Senator Al Gore, the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate, has led the
attack on Mr Bush's handling of Iraq, acknowledging his successful handling
of the Gulf war but saying his earlier policies led directly to the war.
This week, Mr Gore opened up a new line of attack on the nuclear missile
cuts that President Bush agreed earlier this year with President Boris
Yeltsin of Russia.
Mr Gore claimed the June pact, under which the US and Russia agreed to cut
their nuclear arsenals beyond the levels agreed in the Strategic Arms
Reduction Treaty to 3,800-4,250 warheads apiece by 1999 and to eliminate
multiple warhead missiles, had come unravelled because Mr Bush had taken
Secretary of State James Baker away from the negotiations to supervise his
re-election efforts.
State Department officials denied the so-called Start II agreement had been
hindered by Mr Baker's departure, but acknowledged that they had not yet
succeeded in translating the Bush-Yeltsin agreement into a formal text.
Mr Richard Boucher, State Department spokesman, said the discussions were
largely technical.
He knew nothing about reports that Russia was reluctant to destroy the silos
holding multiple warhead SS-18 missiles, which are to be eliminated under
the Bush-Yeltsin accord, he added.
Mr Gore charged in his debate on Tuesday with Vice-president Dan Quayle and
Admiral James Stockdale, Mr Ross Perot's vice-presidential running mate,
that the Start I treaty would eliminate only half of the SS-18 silos, and
that Mr Bush had made a mistake by not winning the elimination of the other
half.
Mr Quayle contended that Russia remained committed to the elimination of its
SS-18s, but did not respond on the silos, which critics of Salt II contend
could still be used to launch multiple warhead missiles if they are not
destroyed.
'The President does have a commitment from Boris Yeltsin to eliminate the
SS-18s; that is a commitment,' Mr Quayle said during the debate.

US consumer prices rose a slight 0.2 per cent in September, the government
said yesterday, as a weak economy and wary consumers kept retail inflation
in check, Reuter reports from Washington.
The scant rise brought inflation so far this year to a 2.9 per cent annual
rate. If maintained, that rate would be the lowest since 1986, the
department said.
A 0.7 per cent drop in petrol prices restrained the overall September gain
in the Consumer Price Index, which was down from a 0.3 per cent increase in
August. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, the so-called core rate of
inflation rose 0.2 per cent.

Stone-throwing rioters clashed with police after hearing of the death of a

protests continued yesterday with a strike, AP reports from Jerusalem.
Police broke up several protests in Jerusalem following the announcement on
Wednesday night of the death of Mr Hussein Nimr Assad, 26. Prison
authorities said he died of a heart attack.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the Middle
East peace talks, called the death 'very tragic' and said it could undermine
US-backed Middle East peace negotiations. Police Minister Moshe Shahal told
Israel radio that an investigation has been launched to determine whether
the death was related to the fast.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S acting president Itamar Franco said yesterday his government
remained committed to the 'basic principles' of the modernisation programme
started by President Fernando Collor, who was suspended last month on
corruption charges.
In a message to the Brazilian Chamber of Commerce in Great Britain,
yesterday celebrating its 50th anniversary, Mr Franco underlined his support
for 'the full normalisation of our relations with the international
financial community, the uninterrupted implementation of the privatisation
programme and the opening up of the Brazilian economy.'
He said Brazil 'will always welcome the foreign capital wishing to share
with us the risks of the market economy and the challenges of development.'
In a speech to the chamber, Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the UK Board
of Trade, urged the Brazilian government to move quickly with the
implementation of adequate intellectual property legislation and to continue
to reduce tariffs, which currently average 20 per cent. He also stressed the
importance of Brazil's fiscal reform efforts.
He welcomed recent moves by the Brazilian government to improve the climate
for foreign investment, and said he looked forward to the removal next year
of constitutional limitations on foreign investment in mining and oil and
gas exploration, production and refining.
He said British companies, which already had about Pounds 1.5bn of
investments in Brazil, were particularly interested in developing trade in
several sectors: the construction of the gas pipeline between Bolivia and
Sao Paulo; cellular telephones and fibre optics; ports and airports; oil and
gas production; water treatment and consumer products.

</HEADLINE>

   By ROBERT THOMSON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government was highly embarrassed yesterday when a military
officer suggested that a coup d'etat would clean up the political system.
Mr Koichi Kato, chief cabinet secretary, described the coup idea as
'extremely inappropriate', and the Defence Agency said the major who made
the suggestion in a weekly magazine would be disciplined.
Ordinary Japanese did not take the statement as a serious threat, but the
article reminded many of a series of coup attempts and assassinations during
the 1930s, when young officers demanded that the government intensify the
military campaign in Asia.
The magazine commentary, by Major Shinsaku Yanai, a lecturer in strategy and
military history at Japan's Defence Academy, has caused particular
embarrassment for the military, as it coincided with the controversial
dispatch of Japanese troops on peace-keeping activities in Cambodia.
Maj Yanai's comments were inspired by the controversy over Mr Shin Kanemaru,
who resigned from parliament on Wednesday, after public protests over his
violation of a political donations law and alleged links to gangster groups.
'History has shown that a military solution is the only way left when
democracy does not work and justice is not done,' Maj Yanai wrote in an
article penned before Mr Kanemaru resigned. 'It's now impossible to right
the wrongs legally through elections, the basis of a democracy. What paths
can we take to get rid of this? Only a coup d'etat or a revolution.'
Meanwhile, the struggle for control of the faction previously run by Mr
Kanemaru may be settled, for the moment, at a meeting today. About seven
members of the faction are possible candidates for the title of chairman,
but even if a chairman is quickly selected, the dispute could continue for
several months.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, showed his frustration at the
attention paid to Mr Kanemaru's departure, which dominated the Japanese
media yesterday. The prime minister insisted: 'I am the prime minister and
leader of the government'.
Mr Miyazawa's future is likely to depend on the outcome of the battle within
Mr Kanemaru's old faction, the largest in the LDP, as the premier's faction
is not large enough for him to be certain his two-year term in office will
be completed.
Attention has also turned to Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister,
on whose behalf Mr Kanemaru is said to have sought the help of gangsters to
silence embarrassing protests by extreme right-wing groups.
Opposition parties yesterday demanded Mr Takeshita appear before parliament
to answer questions on the episode, while Mr Hiroshi Saito, president of
Nippon Steel, Japan's biggest steel maker, made an unusual call for the
former prime minister to clarify his role. Business leaders have been more
critical of the government in recent weeks; there are signs that the close
links between the LDP and corporate Japan are fraying.

<DATELINE>
   ABUJA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S military rulers opened talks yesterday on an electoral crisis that
has increased fear that their plan to hand power to civilians could end in
chaos, Reuter reports from Abuja.
Officials in Abuja, the capital, did not rule out the possibility that
President Ibrahim Babangida might delay his January 2 departure. But they
said other options were likely to be studied first.
'It depends on what the NEC (National Electoral Commission) recommends. But
there is a climate building up (for Gen Babangida) to extend,' one official
said.
'If he did that, it would not be of his own volition. He would be compelled
by circumstances,' the official added.
Any extension of military rule is likely to be viewed with concern by the
west, at a time when Nigeria is seeking loans for ambitious industrial
projects, including a big liquefied natural gas complex.
Gen Babangida and the 21-member Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) were
discussing an electoral commission report on fraud allegations in recent
party-run presidential primaries.
Widespread charges of cheating led the military to suspend the primaries in
which Nigeria's two government-created parties were selecting their
candidates for presidential elections on December 5.
Some officers, supported by Nigeria's 30 civilian state governors, are known
to be ambivalent on Gen Babangida handing over to civilians in the present
atmosphere of acrimony among civilian politicians. The governors on
Wednesday ended a two-day meeting in Lagos, with a statement saying they
opposed 'a chaotic and uncertain handover that may lead . . . to another
military intervention'.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-standing Sino-British deliberations over the financing of Hong
Kong's new airport reached another impasse yesterday when China's
negotiators rejected Britain's latest proposals, despite these being based
on ideas put forward by the Chinese.
Mr Anthony Galsworthy, Britain's senior representative within the
Sino-British airport committee, said 'they criticised most aspects of (the)
proposals, but they put forward no ideas of any kind of their own'.
Britain had suggested injecting an extra Dollars HK40bn (Pounds 3bn) in
revenue from land sales connected to the airport infrastructure, in an
adaptation of China's own proposals.
China's main concerns were over the possibility that Hong Kong might be
saddled with airport-related debt after 1997 when sovereignty of the colony
reverts to China.
The latest proposals were viewed as a more cost-effective strategy, which
would at least buy the support of China.
The only interpretation of China's latest refusal to play ball is that the
discussions are now purely about politics and not economics.
There had been little expectation of any resolution of the dispute before
Governor Chris Patten's visit to Beijing next week.
The proposals had been met with a barrage of criticism from pro-Beijing
newspapers that only weeks before had been offering similar ideas as a
workable solution.
Mr Galsworthy indicated that Britain would not be calling for a further
meeting. 'I think it is impractical for the British side constantly to
produce new proposals which the Chinese side then reject. If they don't like
our proposals, we would expect them to produce some ideas of their own,' he
said.
Mr Patten has said that if China wanted to go ahead, a decision could be
reached in a morning, over a cup of coffee.
But he has six weeks to get to the coffee table before the close of the
deadline for the Dollars 9bn airport site formation contract.
Beyond November, this contract might have to be re-tendered, resulting in
the escalating costs that the Chinese negotiators claim to be most anxious
to avoid.

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Italy fears two-speed Community would
leave it behind - Amato's aims at the summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato, is expected to back his French
and German colleagues at the Birmingham summit in pressing to maintain the
momentum towards European unity and avoid renegotiating the Maastricht
treaty. He will also be anxious to ensure European Community leaders can
achieve consensus on the treaty's future.
The Italian government is aware that disagreements at Birmingham could lead
to a two-speed Community, with Italy, a founder EC member, in the slow
track.
Last weekend, Mr Amato made brief trips to Paris and Bonn to meet Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, the French prime minister, and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany
to discuss summit strategy. Mr Amato is understood to have sought assurances
that France and Germany were not planning to go ahead with a two-speed
Europe.
The Italian senate has ratified the Maastricht treaty and the chamber of
deputies is shortly expected to follow suit. The government has virtually
all-party support for its policy of resisting a dilution of the treaty's
aims or changes in its timetable. Despite the lira floating outside the
European monetary system and an economy falling well behind the proposed
criteria for EC convergence, the government bases all policies on the
premise that Italy will remain an integral part of the EC.
In almost complete contrast to British concerns about sovereignty and
subsidiarity, the Italian government welcomes the external disciplinary
framework of the convergence criteria and the exchange rate mechanism.
However, attitudes have changed since the Andreotti government signed the
Maastricht treaty last December. His government took a fundamentally
political view of the treaty, believing that even if Italy could not fully
comply with the convergence criteria, it could not be excluded from the
proposed union in 1997.
The economic and financial crisis of the past three months has served to
remind Mr Amato's government that such a political view cannot be taken for
granted. If Italy fails to tackle its mountain of debt and huge public
sector deficit, Mr Amato realises its Community partners will not feel
obliged to hold the door open for the fast track.
Thus, at Birmingham, Mr Amato will not merely be re-stating Italy's European
credentials and its desire to re-enter the EMS as soon as possible,
hopefully before Christmas; he will also explain his 1993 budget, now going
through parliament, and his plans for bringing the public sector deficit
into line over the next three years.
To retain credibility with his partners, he is also likely to state the
government's willingness to submit to close EC monitoring. This in turn is
expected to facilitate agreement on an EC stand-by facility of some Ecu5bn
(Pounds 3.93bn) currently under negotiation.

debate

<TEXT>
EUROPEAN COMMUNITY leaders should be planning a way out of recession rather
than discussing the minute detail of EC decision-making, Mr Edward Heath,
former Conservative prime minister, said yesterday.
'For the top brass to spend a day arguing about the minutiae of subsidiarity
during an international economic crisis of this severity is ludicrous. We
joined the Community to do as much as possible together. Never was it more
needed than today,' Mr Heath said. He was speaking at the 20th anniversary
gathering in London of the Franco-British Council.
Mr Heath said the lesson of the ERM crisis was the need for a single
currency.
'If we are not to have our currencies picked off one by one by speculators
we must have the strength of one single currency to resist and destroy
them,' he said.

<TEXT>
AS IF John Major's government did not have enough grief: monetary policy in
ruins, no sign of an economic strategy, and trying to place Britain at the
heart of a Europe in danger of cardiac arrest.
Now it is being suggested that the UK - post-devaluation - is technically
poor enough to apply for extra European Community cash from the Cohesion
Fund.
This was agreed at Maastricht for Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece - the
treaty says handouts are applicable to EC member states whose per capita
income is below 90 per cent of the EC average.
Mr John Hume, leader of Northern Ireland's Social Democratic and Labour
Party, yesterday wrote to Mr Major (with copy to the European Commission
president, Mr Jacques Delors), pointing out that UK per capita income at the
purchasing power parities of today's rate for sterling is at 87 per cent of
the EC average. Bingo. Ergo, could we have some of this Cohesion Fund -
which Brussels wants to endow with Ecu10bn (Pounds 7.8bn) in today's money -
for Northern Ireland please?
Mr Hume could not resist being a bit more mischievous. Under EC regional
policy rules, the purchasing power parity formula was used to make sure that
Northern Ireland is defined as among the most backward regions in Europe, so
it can get the most generous EC regional aid grants, even though average
income is higher than the qualifying threshold.
This deal has already had some highly charged political implications. Last
year the EC formed a free trade zone with the seven rich Nordic and Alpine
countries of the European Free Trade Association. The treaty in question,
the European Economic Area, requires the new partners to help backward areas
of the Community catch up, and defined Ireland, both north and south, as one
unit: 'The island of Ireland', equally eligible for such hand-outs.
Mr Hume reminds Mr Major of this precedent, saying 'access to the Cohesion
Fund would underpin the proper planning of an integrated environmental and
transport infrastructure on the basis of the needs of the island of
Ireland'.
Should Mr Major choose to take up the opportunity offered by the UK's
relegation, his alternatives are not appealing. The Cohesion Fund applies to
countries, not regions, so he would have to acknowledge that the UK as a
whole is in Europe's poorhouse. Or he could say that Northern Ireland should
be treated - economically at least - as part of Ireland.

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK will today propose opt-out possibilities from Maastricht treaty
clauses on joint European currency, defence and law enforcement as a means
of resolving the deadlock caused by the Danish No vote in June's referendum,
Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, said yesterday.
He said that the special arrangements sought by Denmark had to be 'legally
binding and not limited in time'.
'We must succeed in our quest for a special deal if Denmark is to continue
to be a member of the European Community,' he stated. 'There is a formula
for solving this problem, but I don't want to elaborate now.'
Mr Schluter, speaking after a meeting of the Folketing's (parliament's)
market affairs committee, said the government believed that binding
arrangements could be made with the European Community without needing to
renegotiate the treaty.
He added that Denmark would also seek more openness and democracy within the
EC decision-making process, reiterating its right to run its own social
policies.
After several days of negotiation and disagreement among Danish politicians
over the terms of the treaty, the market committee gave its unanimous
backing to the position which will be taken by Mr Schluter in Birmingham.
Danish parties, which backed the treaty in the referendum, have said that
extensive and binding amendments to the treaty are necessary in order to
ensure a Yes in the next referendum. However, other EC members have said
they will only consider solutions which do not constitute renegotiation or a
new ratification process.
Denmark already built into the original treaty last December a clause making
participation in economic and monetary union (Emu) subject to a further
referendum later in the 1990s.
Mr Schluter said a concrete Danish proposal would be ready around November 1
after further talks between political parties in Denmark. The first serious
EC discussion of Denmark's special terms will not take place until the EC
summit in Edinburgh in December.

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Kohl hopes event will help host -
Germany wants to give a 'signal of confidence'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY wants the summit to be, above all, a success for Mr John Major,
Britain's prime minister, to strengthen his domestic political position, and
to give 'a signal of confidence' to the rest of the European Community.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who last night met Mr Major for dinner - an
encounter described by the Bonn government spokesman afterwards as
representing a 'positive signal' for relations - is adamant that there is no
alternative to ratification of the Maastricht treaty on European union by
all 12 member states. 'There is no fall-back position,' one senior German
diplomat said.
The chancellor is also angrily trying to halt the debate over whether an
inner core of EC members should press ahead towards union regardless of the
rest.
'This stupid discussion over a Europe of two or three speeds must be
stopped,' said another official. 'It has no basis in fact. It was certainly
never even mentioned in Paris at the discussions between the chancellor and
President Francois Mitterrand.'
What the chancellor wants, his advisers say, is a full-blooded statement of
commitment to Maastricht, with enough political declarations to reassure
Euro-sceptics in Britain, Denmark and Germany that the EC is not some
'bureaucratic leviathan'.
They admit that the summit is not going to solve any of the EC's fundamental
problems, and will not come up with a detailed definition of 'subsidiarity'
 -the concept of maximum devolution of power to national, regional and local
government. It will also do nothing to answer the fears of a large majority
of Germans over the prospective replacement of the D-Mark with a single
European currency.
What it will do, they hope, is set enough clear guidelines so that the
Edinburgh summit in December can solve the subsidiarity problem, and provide
Denmark with the reassurance it needs to call a new referendum on the
treaty.
There is not going to be any independent German initiative on those issues,
in spite of the government's recent memorandum on subsidiarity, because Bonn
is determined that overall control should remain with the British
presidency.
Broadly the positions of Britain and Germany coincide. Mr Kohl has been
emphasising increasingly the need for a 'citizen-friendly Europe', and for
recognition that the EC has been trying to legislate on too many details of
daily lives.
'It is not a criticism of the Commission. We are all guilty,' said one
senior official. 'It is not a question of changing the balance of
institutions, nor of turning the rudder 180 degrees. But we want to show we
are not building up a great leviathan.' He admitted that defining
subsidiarity was proving difficult, and causing divisions between large and
small EC states: the former are happy to carry out more policies at national
level, the latter want them enacted and financed jointly.
The EC leaders are not going to do more than touch on the problems of the
European and world currency markets: Germany has strongly resisted any more
substantial debate.
The British desire to have a debate on reform of the European monetary
system was flatly rejected by Bonn as both unnecessary and unwise: it would
simply cause new speculation in the money markets. According to the Bonn
spokesman, Mr Kohl and Mr Major did not focus on monetary issues at their
dinner. 'There will ne no currency debate tomorrow (Friday),' he said.
The one potentially explosive issue will be the Gatt negotiations on trade
liberalisation, in which Mr Mitterrand appears increasingly isolated in his
determination to resist any further concessions to the US.
Mr Kohl does not want to embarrass his closest European ally, but
nevertheless, 'our position is that it would be an extraordinarily important
signal for the world economy, to have a solution to the Gatt round', the
official said.
An agreement in Birmingham on the EC's stance at the Gatt negotiations would
reinforce the improvement in confidence Mr Kohl hopes to achieve by a
declaration on the Maastricht treaty.
He is acutely aware of the need to revive growth not just in the world
economy, but in Germany as well, where the slowdown threatens any hope of
recovery in the east.

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: ERM reform sidelined by need for
unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORM of the European exchange rate mechanism is the cause that has faded
from the agenda of today's summit.
In the tense and difficult days after sterling's departure from the ERM on
'Black Wednesday', Mr John Major, the prime minister, complained of 'fault
lines' in the European monetary system and gave notice that he would press
the case for ERM reform at today's meeting. After several acrimonious
exchanges between Britain and its EC partners, this ambition has been
largely shelved. Finance ministers will not be attending the summit.
Instead, Mr Jean-Claude Trichet, director of the French Treasury and
chairman of the EC monetary committee, will be on hand to give an oral
report on reform efforts.
The UK's attempt to blame the humiliation of Black Wednesday on the ERM has
foundered because the other member countries stand firmly behind the system.
At a difficult meeting of the economics and finance ministers' council in
Brussels last month, Mr Norman Lamont, UK chancellor, was forced to retreat
from demands for an overhaul of the ERM when he found himself threatened
with isolation.
That meeting patched over the differences by agreeing that last month's
turmoil on the European exchange markets should be followed by 'reflection
and analysis' of developments in global capital markets and in the European
and world monetary systems. The EC monetary committee from the member
states' finance ministries and central banks has been charged with this
task. In a letter last week to the Commons treasury and civil service
committee, Mr Lamont said 'that work needs to be carried forward'.
However, it seems that little has been achieved so far. There will be no
formal written report from the monetary committee for the EC leaders at the
summit. Nor is a detailed discussion of ERM problems planned. The UK now
argues that a summit of EC leaders is not the forum to discuss the nitty
gritty of economics and finance - an argument that ignores the fact that in
1978 two such summits negotiated the creation of the EMS. Birmingham,
officials say, will not be the place for market sensitive decisions.
The UK's retreat from having the Birmingham summit address the supposed
fault lines in the ERM has been accompanied by continued uncertainty as to
what its defects might be.
Mr Lamont talked mainly in general terms about the ERM at his appearance
before the Commons treasury committee this week. He mentioned the strains
created by the incompatibility of monetary conditions and the lack of
synchronisation of the economic cycles of the UK and Germany and the
tensions arising from the large short-term interest rate differential.
The UK has also called for a fairer sharing out of burdens in the ERM. In
its quest for greater 'symmetry' in the system, it has complained about
certain aspects of the way ERM members support their currencies through
intramarginal intervention.
The British government believes the Bundesbank supported the French franc
strongly through intramarginal intervention last month, while according to
Mr Lamont it gave no such support to sterling. The Bundesbank, for its part,
has said that it did buy sterling intramarginally before the pound left the
ERM.
However, the summit will not want to explore such detailed differences for
fear of opening old wounds. They will encourage the monetary committee to
continue its studies. But there is no sign that the majority will swing
behind the British belief that the ERM needs substantial change.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand is hoping that today's planned declaration on
'subsidiarity' will combine the minimum of institutional change with the
maximum public impact to help sell the Maastricht treaty.
It is a strategy which may set him at odds with some EC leaders and the
Commission, who favour a clear listing of the respective powers of the EC
institutions and national governments.
The focus on subsidiarity should take the form of 'a change in behaviour (of
EC institutions) rather a new codification of powers,' Mr Jean Musiteli, the
Elysee spokesman said yesterday.
The principle should be formulated to let people know there would be 'a new
break with the EC decision-making machinery as it has functioned up to now,'
said Mr Musiteli.
The French view is that subsidiarity - the sorting out of who does what in
the EC - cannot be achieved in a legalistic way. 'You would have to be a
surgeon to try to divide with a scalpel what should be done by the Community
and what should be left to member states,' he said.
Rather, it should be up to the EC's top politicians, meeting in the European
Council, to make political decisions on the political principle of
subsidiarity.
The aim should be, said Mr Musiteli, 'to reinforce the Community's capacity
to take decisions in non-controversial, but essential areas' of policy in
and outside the EC.
In this light it is ironic that France expects little or no action on two
other items on today's agenda - monetary co-operation and the Gatt trade
talks.
Mr Mitterrand will be content to discuss, in general terms, the European
Monetary System. Mr Musiteli maintained that last month's crisis showed
there was little wrong with the system itself, but that it was provoked by
the dollar's fall and aggravated by the internal economic problems of some
EMS participants.
This week's failure of US and EC negotiators to produce a breakthrough in
the Gatt talks avoids placing President Mitterrand in awkward isolation on
agriculture. French officials continued to claim yesterday there was never
any question of Mr Mitterrand boycotting the summit. For Mr Mitterrand to
have left his chair empty in Birmingham would, for one thing, have raised
fresh questions about his health.

Restoring order to EC is main aim of summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE most gestures born of panic, the idea of an emergency summit of
European Community leaders seemed like a good one at the time.
Four weeks ago, the money markets were in chaos, and the result of the
French referendum on the Maastricht treaty appeared in doubt. The sense of
an imminent political and economic explosion has now passed, and this may
explain the lack of enthusiasm in Brussels and other European capitals for
today's special one-day summit in Birmingham.
The British presidency under Prime Minister John Major has set its sights
low for Birmingham. In part, this reflects a lack of time for adequate
preparation; but it also highlights the fear of failure. As Mr Jacques
Delors, European Commission president, observed yesterday: the importance of
the Birmingham summit is as much psychological as political.
Ever since Danish voters rejected the Maastricht treaty on European Union in
last June's referendum, the EC has been suffering from a crisis of
confidence in its leaders, its institutions, and its future. This crisis
erupted in Denmark, and then spread during the summer to the UK, and finally
to France, when popular frustration with the government almost led to the
defeat of the Maastricht treaty in the September referendum.
Germany has not been immune - popular disenchantment with the EC is growing,
fuelled by resistance to giving up the Deutschemark in return for the single
European currency prescribed by Maastricht.
The accelerating economic downturn in Germany and elsewhere in Europe has
raised further doubts about the common drive for economic convergence and
future European monetary union.
What is striking about today's summit is how little attention this new
political and economic reality is likely to command - despite its direct
relevance, not just to the ratification of Maastricht but also to the
prospects for implementation of the treaty's provisions.
Thus, it is unlikely that any serious debate will take place on how to pull
member states out of their deflationary spiral; nor how to overcome French
objections to a Gatt multilateral trade agreement which British, German and
American officials say is within reach.
Equally, a discussion on possible reforms to the Exchange Rate Mechanism
(ERM) will be confined to generalities.
Instead, EC leaders will focus on presenting a consensus which covers three
essentials:
early ratification of Maastricht, without a renegotiation of the treaty;
subsidiarity - the Brussels buzz-word for devolving power to the lowest
appropriate level, be it national, regional or local;
and transparency, a loose term which means opening up decision-making to
more public scrutiny and emphasising the benefits of the Community to the
ordinary EC citizen.
The devil lies in the details. A British commitment to early ratification
has partially restored Mr Major's battered EC presidency, removing the
suspicion among its partners which followed sterling's withdrawal from the
ERM last month.
But it does nothing to solve the Danish question. Mr Poul Schluter, the
Danish prime minister, will today propose opt-out possibilities from the
Maastricht treaty. Such an intervention is viewed in Brussels as more than a
foretaste of Danish demands for Maastricht modifications. These spell
protracted negotiations over the next two months, the outcome of which is by
no means a foregone conclusion.
The subsidiarity debate is also fraught with difficulty. The best that
British and other European diplomats in Brussels expect from Birmingham is a
declaration of principle - in plain English rather than the convoluted
Euro-jargon in the Maastricht treaty - which may be sweetened by the promise
of future action to stamp out unnecessary meddling by Brussels.
One idea gaining support is for Mr Delors to produce 10-20 planned EC
directives which could be scrapped early next year (just in time to impress
British MPs who are likely to be scrutinising the Maastricht treaty line by
line in the House of Commons). Scrapping existing Euro-legislation is
another matter. Despite British interest in rolling back the frontiers of
some Community legislation, Commission officials have found it difficult to
come up with examples which would avoid challenges in the European Court.
The British pet-hate - the 48-hour working week directive - cannot be cited
because it would upset France and Germany, the chief proponents, according
to UK officials, even though it captures precisely what many people in the
UK resent most about harmonised rule-making in the Community.
In recent weeks, propelled by the shock of sterling and the lira leaving the
ERM and the imposition of temporary exchange controls in Ireland, Portugal
and Spain - there has been a good deal of talk about a two-speed Community.
Some of the rumours have been aimed at prodding Britain to stop hiding
behind the Danes and ratify Maastricht; others, particularly in Germany,
derive from resistance to giving up the D-Mark.
Birmingham will seek to emphasise that, whatever the difficulties, the EC
remains a Community of Twelve. It is not a privileged club. The image of
unity will be paramount.
Yet however well the British stage-manage this briefest of summits, the
lingering impression is that the Community has yet to contain - let alone
conquer - the crisis which has been gathering since the Danish mutiny last
June.

FT  16 OCT 92 / The Birmingham Summit: Major sets out to re-establish his
authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Brighton last week, Mr John Major began the painful process of rebuilding
his authority with the Conservative party faithful. In Birmingham today, he
must do the same with his European Community colleagues.
Neither task will be easy. Sterling's enforced departure from the exchange
rate mechanism and the threatened Tory rebellion over Maastricht have dented
Mr Major's authority at home and his standing in Europe. The economic
recession continues to to undermine the loyalty of his supporters at
Westminster.
Nor can the prime minister disguise in coming months the tension in a
strategy designed to reconcile the streak of chauvinism in his party with a
personal commitment to good Europeanism. To restore party unity, he has
pledged that British self-interest will be the guiding light of his European
policy. But to persuade his European partners that Britain should not be
relegated to the EC's second division, Mr Major must convince them that he
can and will deliver ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
His first hope must be that none of his counterparts in Birmingham have read
his unashamedly nationalistic speech to the Tory conference. It was tailored
to an audience ready to blame Brussels and Bonn for everything from the
economic recession to the weather. Reminding his supporters of the Second
World War, Mr Major said henceforth the national interest would come first,
second and third in all dealings with Europe.
But that was last week. His message today will be markedly different. Public
reaffirmation of the government's determination to halt the trend of EC
centralisation will be accompanied by private re-assurance to Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and others that he is determined to ratify Maastricht.
But he will explain that the divisions in his party may mean delaying this
until early next year, allowing him time to chip away at the less committed
Conservative rebels.
Mr Major, who met Mr Kohl last night, will seek to rebuild the Anglo-German
bridges burnt in the immediate aftermath of the sterling crisis. Demands for
radical reform of the ERM have been quietly dropped. The most Britain now
expects are a few technical adjustments to intervention arrangements. He
dare not admit it to his own MPs, but the prime minister hopes sterling can
be put back into the system in the latter half of next year.
Britain's ambitions for the 'clarification' of Maastricht - which will
dominate today's discussions and the more important Edinburgh summit in
eight weeks' time - are less dramatic than rhetoric implies.
From Birmingham, Mr Major wants a declaration of intent that other EC
governments will heed public concern evident in the debate over Maastricht
and bring the Community closer to its citizens. He needs a piece of paper
with which to persuade the Commons that his partners are as serious about
subsidiarity, openness and national identity as he is. It will be left to
Edinburgh to give substance to the broad principles agreed today.
No one in Whitehall doubts there will be wrangling about the institutional
changes that will imply. The smaller states want to preserve the role of the
Commission as a counterbalance to the powers of their larger partners. The
concept of subsidiarity has shown itself to be one easily bent to the
particular interests of different governments - often in mutually
contradictory ways.
But the central political calculation that gives comfort to Mr Major is that
his counterparts must agree by Edinburgh a document which will persuade the
Danish government to resubmit the treaty to its electorate. Such a
declaration will help persuade wavering Conservative MPs to return to the
Maastricht fold. That will not make it easy for Mr Major to ratify. But it
should make it possible.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Pentland halts Adidas talks

<TEXT>
PENTLAND, UK-based sporting goods distributor, has withdrawn from
negotiations with Bernard Tapie Finance (BTF) over the purchase of Adidas,
the sports-shoe maker.
Pentland said it had found 'serious problems' during a three-month study of
Adidas's books, but said it could not be specific owing to a confidentiality
clause.
Mr Frank Farrant, finance director, said: 'There were fundamental problems
we discovered which no company, public or private, would have taken on
board.'
But Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial French businessman who founded BTF
and bought Adidas in a highly leveraged deal, challenged Pentland's version
of events and said the company had tried to renegotiate the price and seek
extensions.
'Pentland says things that do not correspond with the truth,' Mr Tapie said.
Pentland took a 20 per cent stake in Adidas last year and in July this year
agreed to raise its holding to 95 per cent, in a deal which valued Adidas at
FFr3.1bn (Pounds 365m). About 58 per cent of the shares were to be bought
from BTF while certain French banks and insurance companies agreed to sell a
further 20 per cent.
Negotiations broke down on Wednesday with the expiry of an agreed extension
to the period for Pentland to examine Adidas.
Mr Farrant said Pentland pulled out when it became clear BTF would not grant
reassurances on the outstanding difficulties.
But advisers to BTF blamed Pentland's chairman, Mr Stephen Rubin, for being
too cautious and delaying the due diligence period unnecessarily.
The apparent breakdown in talks leaves the future of Adidas uncertain.
Analysts said Pentland, which has net cash of more than Pounds 250m from the
sale of its investment in Reebok, the US sports-shoe maker, was a natural
fit for Adidas.
Adidas needs fresh investment to enliven its brand name and to source more
products from the Far East, where Pentland is particularly strong.
BTF said yesterday it would inject between FFr500m-FFr600m into Adidas
although it was not clear how Mr Tapie would fund his portion.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Jobless rise fuels concern over economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, ALISON SMITH and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRITICISM OF the government's handling of the economy grew louder yesterday
as a sharp drop in consumer confidence and another big rise in unemployment
dimmed prospects for an economic recovery.
Official figures showed that the number of people unemployed and claiming
benefits rose by 32,200 last month to a five-year high of 2.84m, leaving one
in 10 of the labour force out of work.
Accelerating unemployment growth and a steep drop in Jobcentre vacancies
indicated that further sharp rises in the unemployed total are likely before
the end of the year.
The cabinet gave no response to the figures after meeting to discuss public
spending yesterday but the government came under renewed attack from
backbenchers, business and industry.
Consumer confidence has also continued the decline that began shortly after
Mr John Major's April election victory. A Gallup survey, carried out before
the government's announcement on Monday of plans to shut 31 mines, found
that more than half of Britons expect the economic situation to deteriorate
during the next 12 months while only a sixth expect it to improve. This was
the gloomiest finding for at least five years.
In London the news that the unemployment rate had reached 10.1 per cent
helped push the pound down nearly four pfennigs to DM2.462, while in New
York it was quoted at DM2.461 at the close.
The deteriorating economic picture in the UK is being increasingly cited by
foreign investors as a reason for sterling's weakness on the foreign
exchanges. The FT-SE Index of 100 leading shares closed down 28.1 at 2,546.6
as the government's apparent reluctance to cut base rates, currently at 9
per cent, depressed UK equities.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said she was 'deeply
concerned about the personal hardship of unemployed people and their
families' but said the latest rise in the jobless total reflected world
economic circumstances.
Unemployment in the UK has now risen by 78 per cent, or 1.25m people, since
the figures started to rise more than two years ago. The latest increase
took seasonally-adjusted male unemployment to 13.4 per cent, the highest
rate since records began in May 1986.
Recent announcements of job losses - particularly from the coal industry -
suggest that the rate of growth in unemployment is unlikely to slow before
the end of the year. Last month's 11 per cent fall in job vacancies also
pointed to a gloomy outlook.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, said: 'The worst is yet to
come - that's the bleak message from these figures.' Conservative
backbenchers stepped up their criticism of the government's handling of the
economy.
Mr John Butcher, MP for Coventry SW, and a former minister, said all
economic indicators were 'screaming for a reduction in interest rates'.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Cabinet insists pit closures plan must go ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, RALPH ATKINS, DAVID GOODHART and JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CABINET, which had not discussed the drastic programme of pit closures
before it was announced on Tuesday, insisted yesterday the plan had to go
ahead.
It said ministers should make fresh efforts to argue the economic case for
the closures in the face of a rising tide of protest which threatens the
most significant Tory revolt since Mr John Major became prime minister.
Meeting in Sheffield, the National Union of Mineworkers did not call a
strike ballot in the hope of triggering a poll-tax style public revolt on
the issue.
Opposition to the plan is putting at risk the government's majority at
Westminster. The fact it was agreed by a small group of ministers rather
than the full cabinet has increased concern that the full implications were
not addressed.
Senior ministers said the argument for closing 31 of British Coal's 50 pits
with the loss of 30,000 jobs had not been explained sufficiently to get
public support, as the prospect loomed of a significant Tory revolt in next
week's Commons debate on the coal industry.
Downing Street said Mr Major had been 'fully engaged' in the decision, which
had been taken after discussion with the ministers most closely involved.
These included Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary; Mr Tim
Eggar, energy minister; Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary; and Mr
Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary.
There was surprise at Westminster, however, that some ministers had been
unaware of the closures before Tuesday's announcement, and that Mr David
Hunt, Welsh secretary, had not been told that Point of Ayr colliery in Wales
would be among the casualties.
The closures appeared to dominate the domestic agenda at yesterday's cabinet
meeting, which lasted two hours instead of the planned 30 minutes.
Adding to the confusion at Westmister, senior Whitehall officials said early
today that the government had brought forward the announcement of the pit
closures in response to a request from British Coal.
The officials said that Mr Major's original intention had been for the
closure programme to be discussed and agreed by the full Cabinet yesterday
and announced in the House of Commons early next week. But the management of
British Coal had asked for authority to make the announcement early this
week following a spate of leaks.
Mr Heseltine is to make a statement on the closures to the Commons when
parliament resumes on Monday, but the critical moment for the government
will come on Wednesday when its 21-strong majority is at risk in the debate
called by Labour.
Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, has made it clear he is interested in
defeating the closure plans, and is drafting a simple motion intended to
give Tory MPs the least possible excuse for not supporting it. He said it
was 'astonishing and appalling' that the decision had not been taken by
cabinet.
But Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, defended the handling of the
decision, saying the issues had been 'very thoroughly discussed and fully
assessed by the ministers concerned', who had had the opportunity to talk to
their colleagues.
The need for the government to offer a better explanation for the closures
was underlined by Mr Tom King, a former Tory cabinet minister. He said it
was vital to assure people that 'the implications of this have really been
thought through'. A briefing from Conservative central office has been sent
to every Tory MP, but numerous backbenchers have already made public their
opposition. Protests have come also from Tories outside parliament.
Mr David Nicholson, Tory MP for Taunton, attacked the decision as 'economic
madness'.
The NUM delegate conference in Sheffield decided to try to maximise public
support for a campaign against the closures rather than press for an
immediate strike ballot which many delegates said would be lost.
At the same time the NUM and Nacods, the pit supervisors union, were
applying for an injunction against the closures - the first six of which are
due to take place today - arguing that British Coal failed to consult the
workforce as it is bound to do under the colliery review procedure and both
British and EC employment law.
A High Court judge will today decide whether to grant the injunction, but
most analysts believe there is little chance of the unions succeeding. The
judge said British Coal should take no steps to dismiss miners at the six
pits until he has ruled.

FT  16 OCT 92 / Major pledges to ratify EC union treaty
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BIRMINGHAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night offered his European partners an unequivocal
commitment to ratify the Maastricht treaty in spite of the mounting
opposition in his own party.
As the prime minister held a series of bilateral discussions with other
European leaders on the eve of today's Birmingham summit, British officials
voiced confidence that the meeting would end with a clear statement of
intent on the future direction of the Community.
However, they cautioned against expectations of any 'breakthrough' to end
the near-paralysis in the EC caused by the Danish rejection of the treaty.
Mr Major, who will chair the meeting, is looking for a clear pledge on
subsidiarity to help damp opposition in the Tory party ahead of the Commons
debate on Maastricht, paving the way for ratification at the end of the year
or early next year.
Support emerged for Mr Major from both Bonn and Brussels last night. Mr
Jacques Delors, European Commission president, said: 'I recognise that the
political situation in Britain is very difficult. One of the objects of this
(summit) is to help Mr Major and the British government.'
German officials said that Bonn wanted the summit, above all, to be a
success for Mr Major, to strengthen his domestic political position and give
'a signal of confidence' to the rest of the EC.
Britain and Germany appeared to have patched up their quarrel over recent
currency turmoil and German interest rates. After two and a half hours of
talks between Mr Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a UK spokesman said there
was no problem with the German government over sterling's withdrawal from
the European exchange rate mechanism.
'I think the relationship with the German government is very good. The
problems with the Bundesbank are history,' the spokesman said.
During dinner, Mr Kohl reassured Mr Major that there was no question in his
mind of a 'two- or three-speed Europe.' The Community must move ahead as 12,
Mr Kohl said, according to the British spokesman.
A draft declaration presented by the British presidency to other governments
said the 12 should combine reaffirmation of the Maastricht treaty with a
series of pledges to decentralise decision-making, to inject greater
openness into the Community's institutions and to offer reassurance that
European union will not threaten national identities.
However, fundamental disagreements remaining about the precise application
of the principle of decentralisation or 'subsidiarity' mean that the
Birmingham declaration will do little more than commit the leaders to more
detailed decisions at the Edinburgh summit in December.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK shoots itself in the foot over wild birds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's latest row with the European Commission over the shooting of wild
birds has turned out to be not only a storm in a teacup - but one of
Britain's own making.
Senior Commission officials yesterday confirmed that the prohibition against
farmers and sportsmen shooting birds such as crows and woodpigeons was
inserted in the relevant 1979 directive at the insistence of member states,
chief among them the UK. The Commission's original proposal 'specifically
said pest birds could be shot', said Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC environment
commissioner.
'It's unfair to accuse the Commission on something we didn't originally
want,' he added.
The dispute was seized on, particularly in the British media, as an example
of the sort of meddling by Brussels which the member states will discuss how
to stop at tomorrow's Birmingham summit of EC heads of government.
On Monday, after prominent reports that the Commission was prosecuting the
UK over the issue, Mr Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons foreign affairs
select committee that such isues were 'a matter for national governments
acting in line with national traditions, national feelings'.
The prosecution, launched after complaints from British wildlife
organisations that the government was not enforcing the law, had in any case
been dropped in June.
Brussels shelved the case, Mr Van Miert said, because the Commission is
preparing an amendment to the wild birds directive.
This amendment would turn the directive back towards the original Brussels
proposal allowing the shooting of pest species.
'The original reasoning is still valid,' he said, but the prosecutions went
ahead 'because that is what the law said.' Mr Van Miert also revealed that
the Commission is working up proposals for the decentralised implementation
and monitoring of EC environment legislation.
This would be a pragmatic response to the UK's proposal for an EC
inspectorate to make sure all member states comply with EC law.
This is a plan several member states regard as the sort of intrusion into
national affairs Britain says it is trying to halt.

<TEXT>
TURKEY has formally warned its allies that without substantial changes it
may be unable to recommend to parliament the current offer of associate
membership of the 9-nation Western European Union (WEU) defence
organisation.
Mr Ozden Sanberk, undersecretary at the Turkish Foreign Ministry, told
European ambassadors that Ankara wants full WEU participation, including
voting rights on issues directly affecting its security, and where it has
committed troops. Not being a signatory to the WEU Treaty, diplomats say
Turkey is demanding its associate status be enshrined in a separate legal
document. As a Nato member, but not an EC partner, Turkey, with Norway and
Iceland, was offered associate membership of the WEU.
Turkey's Motherland party, the main opposition party, has stated it will
vote against ratification of the WEU offer when it comes to parliament. With
the coalition now under strain following recent defections of some 18 social
democrat deputies, there is every possibility the government would lose such
a vote.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced interest payable and an exceptional credit helped Delyn Group
increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 218,000 to Pounds 500,000 in the 26
weeks to August 2.
Sales were 10 per cent lower at Pounds 6m (Pounds 6.63m) and interest
payable declined to Pounds 108,000 (Pounds 224,000) reflecting action to
reduce borrowing levels. An exceptional Pounds 104,000 was related to the
sale of surplus development land.
The manufacturer of consumer packaging has raised the interim dividend to
0.5p (0.45p) on earnings per share 3.94p (1.27p).

FT  15 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Isosceles/Fitzwilton
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sale yesterday of the Northern Irish food retailer Wellworth is a cruel
reminder of how businesses at the moment are worth only what someone will
pay. Wellworth's location doubtless restricted the number of potential
bidders. But an exit earnings multiple of just under 10 is hardly a handsome
rating for an apparently well managed company with enviably well protected
market share. Depressingly for Isosceles, this was the easy bit. The next
question for the debt-laden owner of Gateway is whether it can recoup any of
the Pounds 278m splashed out in March 1986 for Herman's sporting goods.
Conversely, of course, yesterday's deal looks attractive for Fitzwilton. The
structure is also ingenious.
The Irish company is 90 per cent geared, yet has managed to take effective
control of a business currently valued at more than 2 1/2 times its own
market capitalisation without further stretching its balance sheet.
Wellworth's stable cash flow is part of the secret, but so is Mr Anthony
O'Reilly's readiness to help fund Fitzwilton's investment by subscribing up
to Pounds 14m of subordinated loan stock. Such commitment is impressive,
though he is being well rewarded for the risk. Perhaps he also feels it is
the least Fitzwilton's wealthy North American shareholders would expect
after the disappointments of recent years.

FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Europe launches friendly
invasion of US - Laurie Morse examines the appearance in Chicago of the
FT-SE 100 index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE launch today of the FT-SE 100 index on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange and a corresponding option contract on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange is seen as the first wave of a friendly invasion of the US by
European-based index futures products.
US investors are increasingly buying foreign equities, a trend that US
futures exchanges have been quick to capitalise on in their scramble to
diversify and maintain their share of global financial trade.
The New York-based Comex will begin trading futures on the European Options
Exchange's index of most actively-traded European stocks, the Eurotop 100,
on October 26, with the American Stock Exchange offering options on the
index.
US exchanges are also eyeing Germany's DAX and France's CAC-40, waiting for
trading and regulatory climates in those countries to ripen to a point where
US-based contracts will be feas-ible.
The success of the US derivatives on these foreign markets will depend on
whether institutional investors find them more profitable and convenient to
trade than home-based varieties.
US futures exchanges are betting that fund managers will be attracted by
their lower costs, familiar trading hours, dollar-denomination, plus
familiar American regulations and settlement procedures.
In contrast, the big international trading houses - which have global
trading capacities and prefer older and deeper markets abroad - are less
likely to be tempted.
Mr Roger Clarke, president of Los Angeles-based TSA Capital Management, a
consulting firm which advises pension fund managers, says that less than 5
per cent of pension fund assets are currently invested in foreign equities.
Like others, he expects that to rise to 15 to 20 per cent among more
aggressive funds.
'Indexes are a natural way to get that foreign exposure,' he says. Since the
US-based contracts are valued in dollars, they also let a fund manager
invest in a particular country without taking a position in tumultuous
foreign currency markets.
But US contracts are expected to be only a moderate success. If the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange's two-year-old Nikkei-250 stock index future is an
example, strong name recognition, an active underlying stock market and an
enthusiastic investment community produce only tepid results. While traders
say they have no trouble executing large trades in the CME's Nikkei pit,
volume levels are not consistent.
The Chicago Board of Trade's stab at the Japanese market, in the form of
Topix futures, fizzled out, partly because it was valued in yen rather than
dollars.
Traders say the new US FT-SE and Eurotop futures are likely to face the same
handicap that hobbles the Nikkei. The underlying stocks will be open only
for a fraction of the futures trading day, making arbitrage between the cash
and futures market difficult. Extended trading days are planned by Amex and
Comex to compensate for this problem.
'Trading a stock index future while the cash market is closed is like making
a bet on how the (foreign) stocks will open the next morning. There's a lot
of risk in that,' a Chicago trader noted.
Also, Wall Street analysts say the Eurotop does not have enough name
recognition in the retail community to spark interest, and a pan-European
index has limited appeal to institutional investors.
'Our clients want to be able to invest in the economies of individual
countries. Mixing them up in a cross-European index confuses the currency,
political and economic differences,' said TSA's Mr Clarke.
The Amex's rival, the Chicago Board Options exchange, came to a similar
conclusion when it shelved plans for options on a European stock index
called the Eurotrack 100. It has instead turned to launching options on
stocks of individual countries.
The US-based FT-SE 100 contracts will begin on a stronger footing. The
decision by the sometimes warring CME and CBOE to join forces and offer
FT-SE futures and options together, with beneficial arrangements on trading
fees, will make the product simultaneously available to the two exchange's
huge crowds of experienced stock index traders. Options trading generally
helps boost futures volume.
Trades that bet on economic differences between countries could also
develop, since the contract size and other specifications for the CME's
Footsie futures are similar to those for the exchange's Nikkei and S and P
500 futures, and could encourage spread trading.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch consumer electronics group, is increasing its holding in
Pieco Electronics and Electricals, its Indian venture, to 51 per cent from
39.7 per cent, taking advantage of liberalisation of local foreign ownership
laws.
It also plans to enter the country's expanding telecommunications product
market.
Pieco will revert to its earlier name, Philips India, and become part of
Philips' worldwide operations. It hopes the Philips brand name will boost
consumer sales, now about 57 per cent of Pieco's turnover.
By December, Pieco's share capital will be increased to Rs455m (Dollars 16m)
from Rs333m, with the Dutch parent contributing Rs340m - the cost of buying
an additional 11 per cent of the company's capital at a premium of Rs30 a
share.
Philips India and Philips Kommunications Industrie (PKI), Philips'
Nuremberg-based subsidiary, will set up a pilot project in New Delhi to
produce equipment based on synchronous digital hierarchy technology
pioneered by the German company.
Philips India, with technological support from Philips Telecom of Cambridge
in the UK, will introduce a range of telecommunication equipment, such as
private mobile radios and wide-area pagers. A factory will be built in
Calcutta with a projected investment of Rs150m to augment and modernise
Philips' facilities.

MIM said its net operating profit increased to ADollars 34.5m from ADollars
3.5m, because of higher metal prices and lower operating costs. Sales were
up to ADollars 455m from ADollars 408m, in spite of the exclusion of the

It said copper prices were up 23 per cent in the first quarter of last year,
lead was up 12 per cent, and zinc 59 per cent.

GANNETT, US publisher of 82 daily newspapers including USA Today, yesterday
revealed a 34.4 per cent rise in third-quarter net income, to Dollars 80m.
Earnings per share rose by 33 per cent year-on-year, from 42 cents to 56
cents.
The results, struck on third-quarter revenues only 3.5 per cent higher at
Dollars 848.6m, were helped by improved earnings in the newspaper and
television divisions, reflecting improved advertising revenues and lower
newsprint expenses. Reduced interest expenses also contributed.
Third-quarter operating income rose by 20.9 per cent to Dollars 141.9m.
Interest expenses were Dollars 11.4m, a drop of 46.6 per cent year-on-year.
Newspaper advertising revenues rose by 3 per cent in the quarter. At USA
Today, paid advertising pages advanced by 14 per cent year-on-year, while ad
revenues at the popular paper increased by 13 per cent.
Broadcasting revenues were 9 per cent higher at Dollars 89.4m, while
television revenues improved by 13 per cent, reflecting the benefit of
Olympics programming on four NBC-affiliated stations.
In the first nine months, net income was 14.5 per cent higher at Dollars
234.2m. Revenues were Dollars 2.53bn, up 2.1 per cent.

FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Czechs pick motorway bidders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN, French and Italian companies have been shortlisted to bid for one of
the first privately financed motorways in eastern Europe.
Three consortiums have been chosen by the Czech Republic to bid for an 83km
stretch of motorway from Rozvadov on the Czech-German border to Plzen,
roughly halfway between the border and Prague.
It is part of a planned motorway linking the Czech capital and Nuremburg in
Germany.
The road is expected to cost about Pounds 280m, including finance charges,
according to Kleinwort Benson, the British merchant bank advising the Czech
authorities.
The republic plans to offer concessions for a further 400km of private toll
motorway if the initial project succeeds.
The three consortiums include construction companies and toll road
operators. They are: Strabag International of Germany; Stavby of the Czech
Republic and GTM International, Dumez International and Cofiroute of France.
Philipp Holzmann of Germany; Cogefarimprsit of Italy and Nord Franc,
Tranroute International, and Beugnet of France.
Italstrade, Autostrade, Salini Construttori and Girola of Italy and Hochtief
of Germany.
The Czechs, who face heavy demands on their road systems because of rising
levels of car ownership and growing east-west trade, have turned to private
operators because they lack funds to build motorways themselves.

FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: German bid to outmanoeuvre tank sales ban
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN industry, barred from selling heavy weapons directly to Arab
countries, is collaborating with France in an attempt to sell tanks to the
United Arab Emirates.
The deal for 390 tanks could be worth Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.6bn) including
spares and support.
Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan, ruler of Abu Dhabi and UAE president, is
believed to have provided funding to develop a special version of the French
Leclerc tank equipped with a German engine similar to that used in the
Krauss-Maffei Leopard 2.
Vickers of the UK and General Dynamics of the US are also competing for the
order, the biggest of any currently in prospect for western tank
manufacturers.
This week Kuwait chose General Dynamics' M1A2 Abrams for a 236-tank order in
preference to Vickers' Challenger 2.
Several Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia - which is also in the market
for more than 200 tanks - have long coveted the German Leopard. But they
have been prevented from buying it under Bonn's strict arms export rules
which forbid sales that might increase regional tensions.
The latest Franco-German project could prove embarrassing to Mr Volker Ruhe,
German defence minister. His predecessor, Mr Gerhard Stoltenberg, resigned
in March after it was disclosed that 15 Leopard tanks had been sent to
Turkey in spite of an embargo ordered by the Bundestag because of Turkish
actions against the Kurds.
In the late 1980s Germany halted efforts to sell a collaborative UK-German
tank - using a Leopard chassis - in the Middle East.
Deutsche Aerospace yesterday confirmed that its subsidiary Motoren- und
Turbinen-Union (MTU) was developing a version of the engine it makes for the
Leopard in order to fit the new French Leclerc tank, and had started
procedures in Bonn to seek an export licence.
However, it said Leclerc prototypes already sent to Abu Dhabi were not
equipped with MTU engines.
Giat Industries, the state-controlled French company which produces the
tank, earlier declined to comment on the engine plan but said: 'We are
adapting to the needs of our clients.'
US and French industry experts say Sheikh Zayed is believed to have provided
Dollars 50m to cover the costs of integrating the German engine after the
French diesel engine was judged unsatisfactory.
Engines and transmissions would be expected to account for about 10 per cent
of the total contract value.
France has until now been the UAE's main supplier of arms including battle
tanks and fighter aircraft.
Experts are puzzled, however, by Sheikh Zayed's plan for a specially
developed version of the Leclerc. Incorporating the MTU engine is expected
to require an increase in the tank's overall length.
Neither the Leclerc nor the British Challenger 2 has yet won an export
contract.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Fuel switch defended by generators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY companies responded sharply to allegations yesterday that they
had contributed to the sweeping closures at British Coal by switching from
coal to gas.
East Midlands Electricity, which is building a gas plant at Corby,
Northants, said: 'We wouldn't enter into developments unless they represent
value for our customers and put downward pressure on prices.'
The 'dash for gas' was typified only two weeks ago when Mr Ed Wallis, the
chief executive of PowerGen, one of the UK's two large power generators,
opened a 900MW gas-fired station at Killingholme, Humberside. On the same
day, National Power, the other large generator, announced that it was
closing 2,700MW of surplus power plant, most of it coal-fired.
On the face of it, the position does indeed look absurd. The UK is shutting
down long-established power stations using an important national resource
which is plentiful and might last for hundreds of years. In their place it
is investing billions of pounds in new stations using a fuel that might run
out in 50 years.
At present, 16 gas-fired power stations are either running or under
construction with a total capacity of 11,000MW, equivalent to about a fifth
of requirements in England and Wales. They will displace about 30m tonnes of
coal a year.
A factor driving the change was the lifting last year of an EC ban on the
use of gas for power generation, opening up the North Sea's vast gas
reserves to a new market.
A second was the privatisation two years ago of the electricity industry,
which gave the regional distribution companies greater freedom to choose
where to buy their power.
A third was the environment. At a time when the UK is committed to reducing
emissions of carbon dioxide and sulphur, natural gas provides a relatively
clean source of power.
The fourth is economics, although the picture here is murky. The companies
investing in the new power stations claim that they make good commercial
sense. Mr Malcolm Faulkner, marketing director at Norweb, which is involved
in two gas projects, said yesterday that they enabled Norweb to spread its
risks across a wider range of fuels and technologies.
Others are less sure. The Coalfield Communities Campaign, which is fighting
the pit closures, calculates that many gas plants will produce more
expensive electricity than the coal-fired stations they are driving out of
business.
The economics of gas-fired stations are complicated by the fact that British
Gas, which is supplying many of them, raised its prices for long-term
contracts by 25 per cent last year as the full scale of the dash for gas
became clear. That means that companies that signed up early have a much
better deal than the late-comers.
A further complication is that the cost of generating electricity from coal
does not necessarily include the huge cost of installing emission control
equipment. That can add as much a 1p to the typical cost of 2.4p a kWh.
Under the present price regime, electricity distribution companies are
allowed to pass on the costs of power generation to their customers. Large
power consumers say that gives them no incentive to go for the cheaper
fuels. Professor Stephen Littlechild, the electricity regulator, is to
examine the gas contracts in a review of the electricity companies' overall
supplies.
He said he would look for 'a control which provides sharper incentive to
economic purchasing'.
Top industrial consumers are to test the government's claim that electricity
prices are falling. The Major Energy Users Council, which represents the
largest organisations using electricity, is to conduct a survey among its
members to ascertain how prices have been moving this year.
The council said many of its members did not believe statistics which showed
lower electricity costs. 'Many of them have faced steep increases,' it said.

FT  15 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: European exchanges map out
futures expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS competition between futures exchanges intensifies, European exchanges are
hurriedly drawing up plans for international expansion.
Potential routes involve forging links with other exchanges; joining Globex,
the international after-hours trading system jointly developed by the
Chicago Board of Trade, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters; or
pushing ahead with the development or expansion of rival systems.
So far, the Matif, the Paris-based exchange, is the only European exchange
to have signed up to join Globex. Its French bond futures will start trading
on the system in the first quarter of next year.
The two European exchanges closest to joining Globex are the London
International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) and the
Deutsche Terminborse, the German screen-based exchange. However, both
exchanges point out that negotiations are still at a preliminary stage.
'We put the terms under which we would join to the CBOT a month ago,' said
Mr Michael Jenkins, Liffe's chief executive, 'but we have not taken it any
further.' However, discussions will be held next week in Chicago with
further talks early next month. The main stumbling block is likely to be the
length of Liffe's initial commitment to the system: Liffe wants a
short-notice period, Globex is asking for a 20-year commitment.
'One of our concerns is that the ultimate control of all the major issues
rests with the CBOT and the CME,' said Mr Jenkins. 'Although this may not be
a problem, we would like to have a short contract in the early stages, until
we understand quite how their agreement with Globex works.'
Liffe seems to be softening its stance on its earlier objections to the
issue of exclusivity. Under Globex rules, if a contract commands more than
half the volume in a particular underlying market, no rival contract can be
listed on the exchange. Liffe would prefer contracts to be freely listed but
seems to have given up the struggle on this issue.
'I do not think there are a lot of hard issues to be dealt with,' said Mr
Gary Ginter, managing director of Globex.
In addition, Liffe has to decide the future of its own APT after-hours
trading system, which will be discussed at a board meeting today. There have
been suggestions that the system could be developed, but no decision has yet
been taken.
Globex, on the other hand, is not yet a robust suitor. The three-month-old
system's volume has reached only about 2,500 contracts per day, with only
about 230 terminals in place and another 60 on order. Most of those
terminals are in the US, although, significantly, the 30 Globex machines in
London are the highest volume producers in the system.
The partnership of the world's three largest futures exchanges would lend
muscle to Globex. Liffe's European interest rate contracts, particularly
bund futures, would complement the foreign currency and US Treasury and
Eurodollar instruments already listed on Globex. More importantly, it would
plant more traders and terminals across the European time zone, extending
the reach of the futures products on both sides of the Atlantic.
Competitive factors are a primary reason the exchanges are talking now.
Liffe currently has about 60 per cent of the German bund futures market, but
cannot ignore its rival at the DTB. Listing the Liffe bund on Globex would
throw trading open to the US.
But the DTB is also in negotiations with Globex, and is also considering
links, outside Globex, with the CBOT, or with other exchanges. 'We've got
our feelers out,' said a DTB official.
The DTB is also planning to expand internationally by establishing trading
terminals throughout Europe. The exchange hopes to have terminals in London
during the first half of next year.
Meanwhile, smaller European exchanges are joining together to spread their
distribution. The European Options Exchange in the Netherlands, OM Group,
with exchanges in Stockholm and London, and Switzerland's Soffex signed a
co-operation agreement in May. The alliance, known as First European
Exchanges (FEX) was expanded by the admission of Otob, the Austrian
exchange, last month. They plan to offer local access to derivative
financial products developed in other countries.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Fitzwilton buys Isosceles' N Irish arm for Pounds 122m
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the investment vehicle which owns the Gateway grocery group, has
finally agreed the sale of its Northern Irish Wellworth subsidiary to a
consortium headed by Fitzwilton for Pounds 122m in cash.
The move represents a significant expansion for the Irish Fitzwilton group,
which acts as a holding company for a variety of investments including the
9-store M6 cash and carry business in northern England.
Mr Tony O'Reilly, the flamboyant Irish businessman who chairs Fitzwilton,
said the acquisition represented 'a major opportunity to invest in a highly
successful well-managed retail business' with great potential. 'The
acquisition will transform Fitzwilton and is immediately earnings-enhancing
for our shareholders,' he said.
Fitzwilton will control 42.7 per cent of the acquired company while a group
of institutional investors, headed by County NatWest Ventures, is taking a
54.3 per cent stake. The remaining 3 per cent will be held by Wellworth's
management.
Wellworth has 33 grocery outlets and 21.3 per cent of the food market in
Northern Ireland with a staff of 4,450. It reported pre-tax profits of
Pounds 18.6m on turnover of Pounds 236m for the year ending April 25, 1992.
Isosceles will use most of the proceeds from the sale to reduce further its
Pounds 1.26bn debt although about Pounds 30m will go to fund expansion of
its upmarket Somerfield grocery chain. Isosceles has opened 60 Somerfield
stores so far which are said to be trading 'slightly ahead of programme'.
Last week, Isosceles announced it had an agreement with its bankers and
investors and ruled out out the possibility of any immediate refinancing.
But yesterday Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes, Isosceles' chief executive, said
the company's future financing needs would have to be reviewed in the light
of trading conditions. 'The future is a long time away. A lot will depend on
factors outside our knowledge or control,' he said.
Isosceles had intended to float the Wellworth business but recent market
uncertainty persuaded it that a trade sale was preferable. The City expected
Wellworth to fetch between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m. Mr Mitchell-Innes
said Isosceles had been able to achieve a 'good price' representing a
multiple of 10 times earnings.
The company plans to sell its Herman's sporting goods subsidiary in the US.

FT  15 OCT 92 / People: Bagri - the new LME chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Raj Bagri, chairman of the Metdist Group, is to take over chairmanship of
the London Metal Exchange, the world's main terminal market for physical
metal, on January 1.
He moves in earlier than expected because of the enforced departure of the
present incumbent John Wolff who is leaving Rudolf Wolff, the metal and
commodity broker where he is marketing director and which his family sold to
Noranda, the Canadian natural resources group, in 1981. LME rules insist
that when a board member changes companies he must resign.
Bagri, 62, apart from owning a successful metal trading business, has
extensive non-ferrous metals manufacturing operations in Malaysia and India,
including a copper tube plantand rod and wire mills.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK shoots itself in the foot over wild birds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's latest row with the European Commission over the shooting of wild
birds has turned out to be not only a storm in a teacup - but one of
Britain's own making.
Senior Commission officials yesterday confirmed that the prohibition against
farmers and sportsmen shooting birds such as crows and woodpigeons was
inserted in the relevant 1979 directive at the insistence of member states,
chief among them the UK. The Commission's original proposal 'specifically
said pest birds could be shot', said Mr Karel Van Miert, the EC environment
commissioner.
'It's unfair to accuse the Commission on something we didn't originally
want,' he added.
The dispute was seized on, particularly in the British media, as an example
of the sort of meddling by Brussels which the member states will discuss how
to stop at tomorrow's Birmingham summit of EC heads of government.
On Monday, after prominent reports that the Commission was prosecuting the
UK over the issue, Mr Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons foreign affairs
select committee that such isues were 'a matter for national governments
acting in line with national traditions, national feelings'.
The prosecution, launched after complaints from British wildlife
organisations that the government was not enforcing the law, had in any case
been dropped in June.
Brussels shelved the case, Mr Van Miert said, because the Commission is
preparing an amendment to the wild birds directive.
This amendment would turn the directive back towards the original Brussels
proposal allowing the shooting of pest species.
'The original reasoning is still valid,' he said, but the prosecutions went
ahead 'because that is what the law said.' Mr Van Miert also revealed that
the Commission is working up proposals for the decentralised implementation
and monitoring of EC environment legislation.
This would be a pragmatic response to the UK's proposal for an EC
inspectorate to make sure all member states comply with EC law.
This is a plan several member states regard as the sort of intrusion into
national affairs Britain says it is trying to halt.

TURKEY has formally warned its allies that without substantial changes it
may be unable to recommend to parliament the current offer of associate
membership of the 9-nation Western European Union (WEU) defence
organisation.
Mr Ozden Sanberk, undersecretary at the Turkish Foreign Ministry, told
European ambassadors that Ankara wants full WEU participation, including
voting rights on issues directly affecting its security, and where it has
committed troops. Not being a signatory to the WEU Treaty, diplomats say
Turkey is demanding its associate status be enshrined in a separate legal
document. As a Nato member, but not an EC partner, Turkey, with Norway and
Iceland, was offered associate membership of the WEU.
Turkey's Motherland party, the main opposition party, has stated it will
vote against ratification of the WEU offer when it comes to parliament. With
the coalition now under strain following recent defections of some 18 social
democrat deputies, there is every possibility the government would lose such
a vote.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fall in value of sterling hits Heron rescue
plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL in the value of sterling has created a problem for bankers working
on the rescue of Heron, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group. The group's 11
bonds are all denominated in foreign currencies, more than half by value in
Swiss francs.
When talks started with the banks early this year the bonds' principal value
was around Pounds 450m but that has risen to nearly Pounds 600m because of
the pound's decline. The group's bank loans were about Pounds 800m, although
some of these are also in foreign currencies.
Although property values have also weakened since the spring, the feeling is
still that banks will do better from a refinancing and orderly disposal of
assets than from receivership.
The 11,000 bondholders are anxious not to give ground to the banks in the
restructuring, expected to involve a debt-for-equity swap. One banker
involved in the talks said yesterday that the effect of the lower pound on
the bond's value in sterling is an issue being discussed.
The company and the steering committee of banks, headed by Barclays Bank, is
meeting all the group's banks on October 20 and outline proposals will be
presented.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FITZWILTON, the Irish industrial holding company, yesterday reported a
further drop in interim profits, but transformed its prospects by confirming
the part-acquisition of the Wellworth grocery chain for Pounds 122m.
In the six months ending June 30, the group reported a decline in pre-tax
profits from IPounds 1.22m to IPounds 1.16m on turnover of IPounds 234m
(IPounds 238m).
More than 95 per cent of Fitzwilton's trading activities are in the UK,
where its profits have been gouged deeply by the recession.
In the full year for 1991 the company reported a drop to IPounds 200,000,
down from IPounds 10.4m in 1990.
The acquisition of Wellworth is to be carried out through Erne Holdings.
The specially created subsidiary is a joint venture between Fitzwilton and a
group of institutional investors led by County NatWest Ventures.
Erne is to be funded with Pounds 41.8m share capital, the 'balance being a
mixture of senior and mezzanine debt.'
Fitzwilton will hold a 42.7 per cent stake, the institutions 54.3 per cent,
while the balance will be held by Wellworth management.
Fitzwilton will subscribe Pounds 18.25m for its stake in Erne.
This will be funded by a short-term bridging finance facility of Pounds
9.75m and an issue of Pounds 9m subordinated loanstock in Fitzwilton, which
will bought by Mr Tony O'Reilly, Fitzwilton's chairman.
This will give him an option to acquire 7.9 per cent of the issued share
capital of Erne, held by Fitzwilton.
Fitzwilton will also have the right to buy out the stake in Wellworth held
by its fellow investors after one year.
Fitzwilton said it intended to reduce its debt to equity ratio of 92 per
cent by the year end. Earnings per share amounted to 0.6p (0.71p).
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.5p.

Greenwich Resources, the UK mining company, hopes to become the first new

Greenwich has been awarded the Konos mining lease, which covers about 22 sq
km between the towns of Komotini and Alexandroupolis in north-east Greece,
and, according to the company, contains an important gold discovery.
Mr David Quick, managing director, said a Drachma 1bn (Pounds 3m) three-year
exploration programme had been submitted as part of the tender, but spending
could stop at any time and the lease forfeited. Newcrest would be
responsible for expenditure in the first 10 months, in exchange for a 51 per

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Seats for change on the Exchange - The SE's
latest solution to little-traded shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THIS the stock market of the future for all but the biggest companies?
The London Stock Exchange took another stab yesterday at solving the
problems of its lesser-traded stocks, and in the process came up with a
system which could serve as a model for a large part of the domestic stock
market in the years ahead.
Illiquid stocks represent a problem which has repeatedly returned to haunt
the exchange in recent years. It happened again yesterday, as UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew said it was to stop making markets in some 150 equities (and a further
50 convertible securities). At least some of these will join the 159
companies which do not have two market makers and so are no longer traded
under normal stock market rules.
Ever since the 1987 stock market crash, and particularly since the UK went
into recession, trading in the shares of smaller companies has declined. As
a result, market makers, whose buy and sell prices are meant to form the
backbone of a competitive UK stock market, have pulled back to cut costs.
P&amp;D yesterday made eight of its 43 market makers redundant, along with a
handful of sales and research staff and two traders on Liffe.
The Stock Exchange's response to this erosion of the market-making system
has until now proved inadequate. First, it relaxed the obligations on market
makers in return for an agreement that at least two houses would quote a
price in all companies.
That failed as market makers pulled out anyway. Next, the exchange proposed
a sole-trader arrangement under which a single market maker would have a
monopoly in the trading of each company's shares. It backed off in the face
of opposition, and launched instead its bulletin board - a simple electronic
notice board on which investors could display the shares they wanted to buy
or sell.
Yesterday saw the latest refinement: the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading
Service, due to begin on November 16. Seats, as it will be known, combines
the bulletin board with the earlier sole trader idea, producing something
very similar to the specialist system that operates on the New York Stock
Exchange. The announcement received a generally favourable response from
investors.
Until the new rules, market makers on Seats will have an obligation to make
continuous two-way prices, fulfiling the role of the specialist in New York.
At the same time, investors will be able to post orders to buy or sell
shares for public display. When market makers trade, they will have an
obligation to fulfil orders on the bulletin board which are at the same
price or better than the price it was proposing.
In addition, the trade in many companies' shares that currently takes place
in brokers' offices - estimated at about 75 per cent of the turnover in many
small companies' shares - will have to be shown to the market maker first.
That will allow the market maker, and investors who have posted orders on
the bulletin board, first bite at the business.
This exposure of orders is what market makers have been calling for for some
time. 'It's enough to give us an incentive,' said Mr David McNamara of
Winterflood Securities, a specialist smaller-company market maker.
Brokers who are now forced to bring more of their business to the central
market place will pay the cost. 'It's very difficult for a broker to hand on
anything,' says Mr Simon Sharpe of Albert E Sharpe, the Birmingham-based
firm which acts as broker to many small companies. 'Brokers are scratching
around for business at the best of times. (But) We would certainly try to
help market makers in every way.'
Market makers will also be helped by new publication rules. All trades by or
between brokers will have to be published immediately. Trades which leave
market makers exposed in a particular share, on the hand, will not be
published, except for disclosure of the price after five days.
If Seats is a success, how far might it eventually extend? While London
clings jealously to its market-making system for the biggest, most heavily
traded stocks, there has long been a belief in the Stock Exchange tower that
other market structures are better for the large rump of less actively
traded companies that make up the UK stock market.
Market makers have resisted any encroachment of order-driven systems on to
their territory, but withdrawals like that of UBS suggest that they are
increasingly pulling back to concentrate on large companies.
'It's quite possible that this (Seats) will end up applying to everything
but the biggest 250-400 companies,' one market maker said. If so, then the
nature of the UK stock market will have changed substantially since the Big
Bang reforms of 1986.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Thorntons 23% lower after poor second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 20 PER CENT contraction in the chocolate market in those distant hot days
of May and June finished off a poor second half for Thorntons, the chocolate
maker and retailer.
Pre-tax profit for the year to June 27 fell nearly 23 per cent to Pounds
9.2m (Pounds 11.9m) on sales up 5.5 per cent to Pounds 84.3m (Pounds 79.9m).
With operating profit down by Pounds 1m at Pounds 10.4m, the pre-tax outcome
was affected by increased interest costs of Pounds 565,000 (Pounds 241,000),
reduced property profits of Pounds 148,000 (Pounds 713,000) and an
exceptional charge of Pounds 824,000.
Thorntons issued a profits warning in May following a disappointing Mothers'
Day and Easter sales apparently disrupted by the election. Mr John Thornton,
chairman, whose family owns 48 per cent of the shares, said the subsequent
hot weather had 'destroyed chocolate sales'. Although the group's ice cream
business had benefited, it was too small to offset the shortfall.
'The average ice cream sale is only 70p compared with Pounds 1.90 for
chocolates, so the business has a long way to go.' But the company now aimed
to expand the product range, possibly into drinks, to balance the portfolio
whatever the weather.
Other factors squeezing operating margins were the inexorable rise in high
street rents, with an average of 11 per cent, and the VAT increase, which it
decided to bear without putting up prices at a cost of Pounds 1m.
The most buoyant area was the supply of chocolates to other retailers,
notably Marks and Spencer. Commercial sales, including the doubling of ice
cream from a small base, went up by 19 per cent to Pounds 14.8m.
In France, where the group has 58 Martial shops compared with its 395 UK
outlets, sales rose by 3 per cent to Pounds 8.73m and the loss was cut from
Pounds 850,000 to Pounds 750,000.
After maintaining capital spending at Pounds 7.8m, the group reduced net
debt by Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 1.9m, gearing of less than 4 per cent.
Exceptional charges comprised the cost of management pruning and property
write-downs offset by the sale of a shop in the Champs-Elysees.
Earnings per share declined to 9.9p (12.6p). A maintained final dividend of
2.4p makes a total of 3.65p (3.6p).
COMMENT
With Mr Thornton prepared to don garish clothing to promote the latest
chocolate range, it is hard to fault the group's dedication to its niche.
And the 'aspirational' tag attached to the Select range suggests that the
company is rightly trying to push some higher-margin lines. However, it is a
little disappointing that the much-invested-in factories have been unable to
keep up with demand. Other niggles have a longer pedigree. After three
years, the aspiration in France remains simply to cut the losses, and the
weather retains a strange hold over such a refined product. That said, the
group has achieved positive cashflow, a reform of management, increased
advertising and advances in ice cream, all in a tough year for discretionary
consumer spending. Pre-tax profit is forecast to recover to Pounds 11.3m
this year, giving a prospective p/e of nearly 14. The market rating seems
fair while the vulnerability to weather and a few treat-peaks (with
Christmas next) make the niche a bit sticky.

An announcement is expected today on the outcome of compromise talks at C&amp;J
Clark, the private shoe manufacturer and retailer which has been rocked by a
boardroom split for two months.
Directors will meet at 10 am this morning in a last ditch effort to avert a
public confrontation at an extraordinary meeting called for tomorrow.
The compromise being hammered out last night is likely to mean the
postponement of the egm until April.
Four members of the Clark family, which controls 80 per cent of the company,
have called for the resignation of Mr Walter Dickson, chairman, and Mr James
Power, non-executive director.
The chairman and Mr Power are supported by five board directors, including
two Clark family members.
The group behind the egm offered a 10-point compromise plan on Tuesday,
which would leave Mr Dickson's position intact.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Waste Management up 62%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASTE Management International, the UK-listed arm of Waste Management of the
US, yesterday reported a 62 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds
40.1m for the three months to 30 September.
Most of the rise reflected acquisitions as the company expanded its
operations rapidly, although there have also been gains from new business
and price increases.
Mr Edwin Falkman, chief executive, said the company had started to feel the
impact of recession in some of its European markets, but economic downturn
was also providing new opportunities for acquisitions.
Turnover increased 41 per cent to Pounds 210.9m while operating profits
increased 48.8 per cent to Pounds 35.4m. During the quarter the company made
acquisitions throughout Europe.
Net interest charges were Pounds 827,000 (Pounds 463,000). But other income,
which includes dividend income from the company's 15 per cent stake in
Wessex Water, and foreign exchange earnings increased from Pounds 1.4m to
Pounds 5.51m.
Earnings increased to 6.1p (4.7p). As indicated when its US parent demerged
Waste Management International and sold 20 per cent of the shares in April,
the company is paying no dividend for the first three years.
For the nine months to September 30, turnover increased 34 per cent to
Pounds 592.8m, pre-tax profits gained 55 per cent to Pounds 102.7m and
earnings increased 34 per cent to 16.8p.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: UK Land 18-month loss at Pounds 17m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK Land, the property investor and developer, which is in talks with its
banks about a restructuring, announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 17.1m for
the 18-months to March 31 after an exceptional Pounds 20m for estimated
liabilities incurred in development programmes.
In the year to September 30 1990 losses amounted to Pounds 14.8m.
Below the line there was a Pounds 24.1m write-off in respect of the group's
development companies which went into liquidation in the period.
For the six months to September 30 a further loss of Pounds 454,000 was
incurred (Pounds 966,000 for the six months to March 31 1991).
Mr Colin Tett, the chairman, said the group had three assets remaining - the
Elephant &amp; Castle Shopping Centre and Camden Lock in London and La Madeleine
in France.
Turnover for the six months to September amounted to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds
10.5m) and losses per share to 11p (20p).

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Pochin's bucks trend with rise to Pounds
2.46m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME LAND and property sales making 'substantial profits' enabled Pochin's,
the Cheshire-based civil engineer and building contractor, to buck the
sector trend, by raising pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.43m to Pounds 2.46m
in the year to May 31.
Mr Nicholas Pochin, chairman, said that there had also been 'a healthy
income from our property and investment portfolio' and that there had been a
'significant reduction in operating costs'.
Group turnover declined from Pounds 38.9m to Pounds 32.8m. Some 85 per cent
of this derived from contracting, which includes 'property development,
design and build and traditional contracting', with the remaining 15 per
cent from concrete pumping.
Since the year-end, Pochin's has acquired the assets of Phillips, the
concrete pumping division of AF Budge. Before the acquisition and in a
market with about 300 pumps, Pochin's had about 100, ASD had 40 and Phillips
20. Since then, ASD has gone into liquidation.
Earnings slipped to 167.6p (169.6p) per share.
The dividend for the year is lifted by 5p to 29p via a final raised 31 per
cent to 21p (16p).

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Next Pounds 89m repayment of convertible
bond
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT, the fashion retailer, has redeemed the bulk of its convertible bond
involving a payment of Pounds 89.2m. The company also announced yesterday
that Mr David Jones, chief executive, had waived rights to options over
717,500 shares and was being offered new options over 200,000 shares.
The repayment was expected as the bondholders had the right to demand
redemption at 133.3 per cent of nominal value and the share price, at 109p
up 1p yesterday, was well below the conversion price of 430p.
However, holders of Pounds 1.9m nominal of the bonds did not ask for
redemption and these remain in existence.
Holders of a similar bond issued by Ratners, the jewellery retailer, are
less certain of the company redeeming the bond on October 30 because of the
group's financial position.
Although Ratners has won an extension of borrowing facilities from its
banks, the bond redemption would need a Pounds 58.5m payment. Ratners can
only make this payment if it does not require new funds from the banks or
breach its covenants. It said in August that if it traded in line with its
business plan then it would be able to make the redemption.
The bond, with a nominal value of Pounds 44m, can be redeemed at the holders
request at 133 per cent of face value. The Ratners bonds are not being
traded at present awaiting news from the company over redemption.
Next, like Ratners and a number of other companies, issued its convertible
bond in 1987 before the stock market crash and achieved a lower coupon - of
5 3/4 per cent - by including the bondholder put option. Another Next
convertible was redeemed in January.
When the bonds were issued the put option was not expected to be exercised
but the market fall and recession cut the share price. The sale of Grattan,
its mail order business, last year for Pounds 168m provided the cash for the
redemption. Next bought and cancelled some of the bonds.
As well as Mr Jones, two other executives have waived rights to options over
63,000 shares. These options were issued in 1987 and exercise prices were
over 200p.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Winterthur to inject Pounds 6m into UK
offshoot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINTERTHUR, the Swiss insurer, is poised to inject a further Pounds 6m into
its rapidly growing UK motor insurance subsidiary, Churchill Insurance.
The money is needed to support further expansion by the company whose
premium income is expected to Pounds 135m in 1993, compared with Pounds 75m
in 1992, according to Mr Martin Long, managing director.
Churchill is one of a number of direct motor insurers which sell insurance
via a combination of intensive mass media marketing and telephone sales,
bypassing the insurance broker, the industry's traditional intermediary.
Direct Line, a subsidiary of the Royal Bank of Scotland, pioneered these
sales techniques and is now the biggest direct motor insurer.
Zurich Insurance, Winterthur's biggest Swiss rival, announced on Monday that
it is interested in acquiring part of the business of Municipal Mutual, the
stricken local authority-owned company.
Mr Long said Churchill has sold a total of 430,000 policies since its launch
in June 1989. He expects to sell 200,000 policies this year and further
300,000 new policies in 1993, lifting Churchill's share of the private motor
insurance market from 2 1/2 per cent to 4 per cent.
Mr Long also says that the company has been trading profitably since April
this year, reducing its likely pre-tax losses to Pounds 2m compared with
Pounds 6m in 1991.
He said the losses reflected expensive start-up costs.
At a time when most of its competitors are sharply ra-tionalising their
operations, Churchill is also recruiting staff.
Some 150 new staff will join the company in the final quarter of 1992 and a
further 120 next year.
Churchill currently employs some 500 people.
Churchill has also rented a further 15,000 sq ft of office space at its
Bromley headquarters.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: CST Emerging Asia fires Jupiter salvo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CST Emerging Asia Trust has fired another broadside in its battle with
Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group which has had a year of disputes
with investment trusts in its stable.
The board of CST plans to dismiss Jupiter Tyndall as fund managers and to
wind up the trust at next year's annual general meeting.
For its part, Jupiter Tyndall previously proposed a merger of CST with
Pacific Horizon Investment Trust (a move rejected by the CST board) and a
financial reconstruction of the trust (a plan which was later withdrawn).
Its most recent plan is to appoint three representatives on the CST board.
In its circular to shareholders, the CST board says it believes 'Jupiter
Tyndall is attempting to gain control of your board without making an offer
for your shares.'
The board 'urges shareholders not to be taken in by Jupiter Tyndall's
arguments and not to support Jupiter Tyndall's undefined proposals which
will incur unquantified expenses and can be expected to realise poorer value
for shareholders than the board's proposal to liquidate CST.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bundesbank sees stable exchange
rates soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German Bundesbank yesterday said it expected exchange rates to settle
down after recent turmoil which led to an effective 6 per cent revaluation
of the D-Mark against other currencies in the European monetary system
(EMS).
However, it suggested there may have to be more adjustments in the run-up to
full monetary union (EMU), due by the end of the decade. Any remaining
exchange rate uncertainties could come to light after next January when the
community formally establishes the single European market.
In its October monthly report, the bank reiterated its insistence that EC
members should use any opportunities to change parities within the exchange
rate system up to the final transition to monetary union.
Meanwhile, the recent effective revaluation of the D-Mark had brought its
value back into line with that achieved by the last formal realignment
within the EMS in 1987. This made it easier to control inflationary
tendencies in Germany, 'so that the quite considerable reductions in German
interest rates achieved so far are not endangered'.
Meanwhile, inflation was still well above 3 per cent, and the side-effects
of recent interventions in money markets had exacerbated the difficulties of
controlling money supply growth.
Today's meeting of the Bundesbank's policy-making directorate is expected to
discuss the effects of recent manoeuvrings to bring down very short-term
interest rates, but no further changes are expected in the domestically
sensitive discount rate or the internationally important Lombard rate. In
the first reductions since 1987, the bank last month cut the discount rate
by half a percentage point to 8.25 per cent, while the Lombard rate fell a
quarter point to 9.5 per cent.

FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Delors warns of 'institutional
paralysis'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, yesterday warned of
the risk of 'institutional paralysis' in the European Community if member
states pushed the principle of subsidiarity too far.
Tomorrow's emergency summit of EC leaders in Birmingham will consider the
practical application of subsidiarity - the principle that the EC should
take decisions only where national or local measures would not be more
appropriate. But it now seems certain that any meaningful statement on the
institutional balance of power in the EC will be postponed.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the British Foreign Office minister, told a special
session of the European Parliament yesterday that EC leaders would probably
ask for further work to be done on the subject. 'Guidelines and criteria'
for the application of subsidiarity would be agreed at December's Edinburgh
summit, he said in his address on behalf of the British presidency of the
EC.
Outlining the Commission's expectations for Birmingham, Mr Delors said he
hoped leaders would demonstrate their commitment to ratify the Maastricht
treaty without renegotiation, their willingness to adopt the 'Delors II' EC
budget proposals for 1993-97, and their desire to open the Community to
other countries.
'If the 12 leave Birmingham with restored confidence, with renewed
enthusiasm for the common European family, that will help change the
atmosphere and improve the situation in Europe,' he told MEPs.
But Mr Delors refused to yield ground to those states - notably Britain
itself - which want to rein in the Commission's powers. He said Brussels was
against giving members a veto over legislation they believed infringed the
subsidiarity principle. A single vote on the substance of the legislation
was essential to avoid paralysis, he added. Mr Delors also supported
Strasbourg's call for increased transparency and democracy in the EC. He
again criticised the Council of Ministers, which takes the final decisions
on EC legislation. 'The Council sometimes seems like a closed shop where
national egos clash.'
The parliament last night backed a motion calling for the council to
legislate in public, and for an 'assizes' of the European and national
parliaments to discuss integration.

STATE Farm, the biggest provider of home insurance in Florida, yesterday

The company now says it expects payments to total around Dollars 2.1bn - of
which more than Dollars 1bn has already been paid out. The initial estimate
was Dollars 1.5bn.
State Farm's new estimate comes as many insurers are revising upwards the
cost of the storm.
The property claims services division of the American Insurance Services
Group, the industry trade organisation, originally estimated insured losses
to be around Dollars 7.8bn.

<TEXT>
CITICORP, the leading US bank, was yesterday reported to be increasing its
preferred stock offering to 68m shares from 42m in order to raise Dollars
1bn in capital, above the bank's earlier Dollars 650m target.
The preferred equity redemption cumulative shares (Percs) were priced late
yesterday at Dollars 14.75 to yield 8.25 per cent a share.
The yield is at the top end of expectations.
Other terms of the offer include a 37.49 per cent capped price premium on
the securities.
It is the second time that Citicorp has increased the Perc offering, which
was originally planned at 32.5m shares.
The move comes in the wake of last week's events at Citicorp, which included
the resignation of the bank's president, Mr Richard Braddock, and the
disclosure that its third-quarter earnings would include large write-offs,
including Dollars 870m in the consumer division.
Citicorp has been scrambling this year to boost its capital by disposing
assets and issuing stock.
Wall Street analysts believe the bank is also planning to offer up to
Dollars 1bn of ordinary shares to further shore up its capital base.
However, Mr John Reed, Citicorp chairman, said that this may be the last
external move to raise capital, depending on economic conditions.

<TEXT>
CBS, the US broadcasting group which owns one of the country's leading
television networks, yesterday reported third-quarter net profits of Dollars
42.7m, a significant recovery when compared with a loss of Dollars 169.1m
suffered in the same period of last year.
The profit, struck on revenues 7.5 per cent up at Dollars 672.8m, translates
into earnings per share of Dollars 2.76, against a loss of Dollars 11.11 per
share a year ago.
CBS said its third-quarter earnings a year ago included a Dollars 195.5m
provision related to broadcasts of professional baseball and football.
The company, which is controlled by Mr Larry Tisch, the billionaire
investor, said profits also benefited from the combined effect of a stronger
prime-time programme schedule, better advertisement pricing and active cost
control.
The CBS television network returned to a 'slightly profitable level' in the
third quarter. Net interest income of Dollars 21.5m also helped, as it was
twice the level of a year ago. Interest income on investments in the quarter
included capital gains of Dollars 14.5m.
For the first nine months of 1992, CBS had net income of Dollars 53.8m,
compared with a loss of Dollars 95.2m in the same period of 1991. Revenues
were Dollars 2.53bn in the first nine months of this year, compared with
Dollars 2.09bn last year.
On Wall Street, the CBS share price was marked Dollars 1 1/4 lower at
Dollars 206.

THE SLUGGISH world economy and weak aluminium prices cut Reynolds Metals'
earnings in half in the third quarter. Income fell to Dollars 20.8m, or 35
cents per share, compared with Dollars 41.5m, or 70 cents, in the same
period last year.
For the first nine months of the year, Reynolds reported earnings of Dollars
67.2m, or Dollars 1.13 per share, down sharply from Dollars 130.4m, or
Dollars 2.20, in 1991.
Third-quarter sales rose slightly to Dollars 1.48bn, from Dollars 1.44bn a
year ago. For the nine-month period sales were Dollars 4.31bn, down from
Dollars 4.34bn.
'Reynolds' results reflect the continuation of severely depressed aluminium
prices due to the weaker than expected economic recovery and the worldwide
oversupply situation,' said Mr Richard Holder, chairman and chief executive.
'Considering the economic climate, shipments were strong during the
quarter,' he said.
Reynolds' aluminium shipments totalled 388,300 tonnes in the quarter, and
1.115m tonnes for the first nine months, up from 386,400 and 1.088m tonnes
respectively in 1991.
Despite the dramatic earnings decline, the results were in line, or even
slightly better, than Wall Street expectations.
Reynolds closed down Dollars 2 per share at Dollars 49 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<TEXT>
EXPLOSIONS rocked the Angolan capital, Luanda, early today in the wake of
intensified diplomatic efforts to prevent a resumption of civil war.
Witnesses said that a big blast occurred at an ammunition dump, sending
rockets into the air and causing smoke to drift over the city. There were
also unconfirmed reports of fighting near the residence of President Jose
Eduardo dos Santos before and after the blast.
Earlier, tension had appeared to ease after President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos, under pressure from the United Nations and South Africa, agreed to
postpone the release of final election results until the conclusion of an
investigation of allegations of electoral irregularities.
Unita, the former rebel group that was backed by the US and South African,
has threatened to plunge the country back into civil war after alleging last
month's elections were fraudulent.
The announcement of the postponement came after a meeting between the
president and Mr Pik Botha, South Africa's foreign minister, who is trying
to broker a political compromise in the war-shattered country's deep crisis.
'This country was on the brink of war before this decision so this is an
extremely important step for peace in the region,' Mr Botha said. Mr Botha
said he would send his aircraft to the central city of Huambo today to

Santos in Luanda.
'There is a wish on both sides to meet, there is a wish to form a government
of national unity,' Mr Botha said.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Key senator demands prosecutor on BNL

PRESSURE was building in Congress last night for the US administration to
reconsider its refusal to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate the
government's handling of the scandal over Dollars 5bn of illegal loans to
Iraq, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
(BNL).
The increased pressure came as Senator David Boren, the conservative
Democratic chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, demanded that a
special prosecutor be named to investigate the BNL-Iraq affair.
He has been holding closed Senate hearings to determine why the CIA and
Justice Department concealed information on the BNL affair from a US federal
court.
Mr Boren said last night that new information had come to light in the past
two weeks that should compel Mr William Barr, US Attorney-General, to
appoint a special prosecutor.
In a letter to Mr Barr yesterday, Mr Boren said the CIA had admitted that,
with the 'strong advice' of the Justice Department, it had written a
misleading letter about BNL to US prosecutors in Atlanta.
Mr Boren cited what he called 'an unprecedented statement' from Judge Marvin
Shoob of the BNL case in Atlanta, which stated that 'decisions were made at
the top levels of the US government and within the intelligence community to
shape this case.'
Mr Boren said 'a truly independent investigation is required to determine
whether federal crimes were committed' in the government's handling of the
BNL affair.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Japan's LDP in disarray as Kanemaru resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Demo-cratic party was in disarray last night after
the resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the country's most powerful politician.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, who headed the largest of the LDP's five factions, resigned
after more than a month of protests from the Japanese public which has been
angered by his violation of a political funds law and alleged dealings with
gangster groups.
Resignations are often reversed in Japanese politics, but Mr Kanemaru has
insisted his will be permanent. It was formally accepted yesterday by Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister.
The resignation will leave the LDP rudderless for the next few months as it
has no other politician of Mr Kanemaru's stature or skills, which were used
to guide controversial legislation through the party and parliament.
Mr Kanemaru had hinted that he would resign but most Japanese did not expect
him to go. One reason for their surprise over his decision is that, only a
few days ago, Mr Kanemaru appeared to be beyond the law, having paid a
relatively small Y200,000 (Pounds 970) fine for an admitted offence without
having been questioned by prosecutors.
The size of that fine, imposed for his illegal receipt of Y500m from a
parcel delivery company, and the generally lenient treatment given to Mr
Kanemaru provoked protests in Tokyo and encouraged the country's business
leaders to call for him to quit.
But the Federation of Economic Organisations (Keidanren) said last night
that Mr Kanemaru's resignation alone would not change the nature of Japanese
politics. The federation has been consistently critical of the LDP's lack of
ethics and recently suggested politicians had lost touch with ordinary
Japanese.
The immediate impact of Mr Kanemaru's departure was to stimulate an already
bitter fight within his faction. Members of that faction warned last night
that it was close to splitting, which could prompt a realignment of all the
party's elements.
Mr Kanemaru's chosen successor is Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a former LDP
secretary-general, though his power has been undermined by the premature
resignation of Mr Kanemaru, who had not yet completed the lobbying needed to
ensure an orderly succession.

FT  15 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Small companies
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The withdrawal of a third large securities firm from the smaller companies
sector raises the question of how much further the system of competing
market makers put in place at the time of Big Bang will be eroded. Following
UBS Phillips and Drew's decision, another 40 companies could be added to the
list of 159 stocks traded on the order-driven bulletin board or quoted on
SEAQ by just one marketmaker.
As it stands, the bulletin board is hardly satisfactory, not least because
an order-driven system only provides a reliable basis for pricing shares if
there is a steady flow of orders. Institutional investors are reluctant to
deal in size, which has damaged liquidity further. Smaller companies which
paid out expensive listing fees feel aggrieved at being relegated. If this
dissuades all but the biggest companies from seeking a public quote, the
depth of the market would be under threat in the longer term.
The Stock Exchange is only too aware of the problem. The system of
specialist marketmakers for individual stocks proposed yesterday may go some
way to slowing the attrition of capital from this end of the market. Making
a market in a small company will certainly look more attractive if the
specialist marketmaker is given the privilege of taking part in all trades
at its quoted price. If this helps restore confidence in the reliability of
market prices, so much the better. Ultimately, however, the problem is not
one of market structure, but lack of investor interest at all but the most
bullish stage of the cycle.

FT  15 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Forte
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Doubtless Sir Anthony Tennant and Sir Paul Girolami are not joining the
Forte board simply to make up the numbers. The presence of such heavyweights
should help develop a more coherent strategy. But if Forte thinks it is
enough to restore its fortunes, then it could be in for a disappointment.
The worrying side to yesterday's announcement was that Mr Rocco Forte will
combine the position of chairman and chief executive. While retiring as
chairman, Lord Forte will remain on the board.
All the signs are that the family is determined to keep a grip just when
outside help is badly needed. The dividend is uncovered. First-half profits
fell 43 per cent on a 1991 period which was itself hit by the Gulf war. The
company has failed to sell its Gardner Merchant contract catering business
and appears to be dithering over expansion in Europe.
In the absence of robust economic recovery, it is difficult to see how Forte
can avoid some agonising decisions. It might have to consider a dividend
cut. If Forte does sell Gardner Merchant and ploughs the proceeds into
European hotel expansion, it will be shedding a cash-generative business for
one which, in the initial stages, will not offer much by way of cash return.
Perhaps the new non-executive directors will persuade Forte to swallow any
necessary medicine. But even so, the short-run consequences for the share
price may be negative. At 150p, Forte is trading on a historic multiple of
25. The market is making demands that are unlikely to be fulfilled.

FT  15 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: The shadow of the poll
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Even without Mr Greenspan's gloomy comments in Tokyo, yesterday's figures
for US retail sales and producer prices confirmed that the economy is
limping badly. While there is not yet a triple-dip recession, the underlying
picture is of very sluggish growth and subdued inflation. That poor economic
outlook may well have doomed President Bush's re-election hopes. The markets
are certainly beginning to think so. In the wake of the weekend's televised
debate, US Treasury bond prices fell on expectations that Mr Clinton would
introduce a mildly expansionary fiscal package. However, the decline was
limited, perhaps because Mr Clinton's room for manoeuvre is circumscribed by
the size of the existing deficit.
On fundamental valuations, US shares have looked expensive for almost two
years, yet share prices have held up in the permanent expectation of
imminent recovery. Com-panies are now starting to report third-quarter
earnings, which may once again fall below analysts' expectations. Current
estimates put the S&amp;P 500 index on a multiple of some 18 times this year's
earnings, and perhaps 17 times earnings in 1993. That is towards the top of
historical ranges and, in the continued absence of a strong recovery in
consumer spending, shares might finally crack. Perhaps the market believes
that some of the fiscal measures suggested by the Democrats, such as
investment incentives, may spark growth in the corporate sector, supporting
share prices. Given that shares still look expensive, there must be a
suspicion that this sanguine attitude would not survive once the full
details of a Clinton budget were known. There is still a risk that the
long-awaited correction has only been postponed until the New Year.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Consortium faces uphill fight over offer for ITN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSORTIUM making an offer for Independent Television News faced an
uphill struggle last night as ITV companies controlling a majority of shares
expressed scepticism about the deal.
Four companies, two of them ITN shareholders, have offered to buy the
400,000 Pounds 1 shares for Pounds 1 each and put up Pounds 30m in new money
to end financial uncertainty at the award-winning television news
organisation.
ITN faces a Pounds 25m deficit on the lease of its London headquarters in
Gray's Inn Road over the next five years.
The four, which would hold at least 80 per cent of ITN, are Carlton
Communications, which takes over the London weekday franchise from Thames at
the beginning of next year, Central Independent Television, London Weekend
Television and Reuters, the news and information group.
Yorkshire Television, which controls 14 per cent of the ITN shares, is
openly sceptical. Mr Clive Leach, chief executive of Yorkshire, said
yesterday: 'The offer grossly undervalues the company. ITN has a strong
balance sheet.' Granada Television, which owns 12.8 per cent of the shares,
is also doubtful.
The deal is dependent on a five-year ITN news supply deal averaging Pounds
53m a year, something Granada might accept if it was a significant ITN
shareholder. It would be less interested in paying such a sum if its stake
were heavily diluted. Thames, with 22.2 per cent of the shares, is also
sceptical.
A 75 per cent majority is needed to change ITN articles of association. At
the moment, only ITV companies can be shareholders. In addition to Central
and LWT, which together have nearly 20 per cent of the shares, companies
likely to support the deal in principle include Anglia, with 4.6 per cent,
and TV South, with 8 per cent.
There was a growing belief in ITV last night that the offer would at least
be a catalyst to break the logjam blocking decision-making at ITN. The big
problem has been who should fund the property deficit.
One possibility is that at least the outline of an alternative grouping
could be put together before Monday's ITN board meeting. This might include
one of the three US broadcasting groups, ABC, CBS and CNN, which have
expressed an interest in taking a stake in ITN.
Such a move has been considered because the 1990 Broadcasting Act requires a
majority of the shares in ITN to be held by non-ITV broadcasters by 1994,
although some ITV companies want the government to change its mind on that
condition.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Republican attempt to discredit Clinton backfires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST-DITCH Republican attempt to portray Governor Bill Clinton as a man
incapable of telling the truth on anything was thrown severely off stride
yesterday.
The Washington Post reported that a senior State Department official had
ordered the US Embassy in London to conduct an 'extremely thorough' search
of its files for anything incriminatory in the Democratic candidate's life
in the UK 23 years ago.
Senator Al Gore, Mr Clinton's running-mate, alleged that Mr Bush was
conducting 'a police state search for information' and was guilty of
McCarthyism.
Mr Dan Quayle, at his most combative in Tuesday night's vice-presidential
debate, said he understood that the State Department official was only
responding to Freedom of Information Act requests put in by the media.
However, the newspaper quoted Mr Norbert Krieg, the US consul general in
London, as saying that the cabled request two weeks ago, also sent to the
Oslo embassy, was pressed the following day in a personal telephone call
from Mrs Elizabeth Tamposi, assistant secretary of state for consular
affairs. Mrs Tamposi, according to her biography, is a Republican political
appointee.
Mr Krieg said the London files were bare. Mrs Tamposi was said to be on
'personal leave', while the head of the Freedom of Information Act office at
the department said files could not be let go without the written consent of
the person under scrutiny.
On Tuesday Mr Bush had denied Democratic charges of McCarthyism, but his
campaign has been embarrassed by having to fire a low-level official who
issued a press release alleging, without substantiation, Mr Clinton was
under communist influence during the Vietnam war.
In the debate, Mr Quayle gave a clear indication of the line of attack the
president is expected to pursue in the next two presidential debates,
starting tonight. Mr Clinton, he charged, was incapable of telling the
truth, not only on the draft and what he did to protest against the Vietnam
war, but also in every aspect of substantive policy. He accused Mr Gore of
'pulling a Clinton' in many of his interventions.
He also claimed that Mr Gore was conspicuously unwilling to come to the
defence of Mr Clinton's character. Mr Quayle's concluding words were: 'Do
you trust Bill Clinton to be your president?' Mr Bush declared afterwards
that his vice-president had 'hit a home run'.
While engaging in some furious exchanges with the vice-president, in which
both scored debating points, Mr Gore did his best to stick to the basic
Democratic message, that the election is about the state of the economy.
Instant polls found that Mr Gore might just have shaded Mr Quayle in the
public eye. But hardly a soul thought that retired Admiral James Stockdale,
Mr Ross Perot's running mate, had shown himself worthy of being the
proverbial heartbeat away from the presidency, a perception which could
damage the legitimacy of Perot's campaign.
Apart from one or two pithy one liners, Mr Stockdale often seemed flustered,
at a loss for words and painfully short of a knowledge of policy issues.

INTERIM earnings at leading Japanese retailers showed mixed results
yesterday as large retailers were hit by a fall in consumer spending while
smaller stores had brisk sales in foodstuffs and lower priced items.
Tokyu Store Chain, a leading supermarket chain, posted a 1.4 per cent rise
in pre-tax profits for the first six months to August to Y2.9bn (Dollars
23.9m), while sales rose 2.8 per cent to Y138.8bn. Net profits rose 5.2 per
cent to Y1.2bn.
FamilyMart, a leading convenience store chain belonging to the Seibu Saison
retailing group, posted a 5.5 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y8.4bn on
a 9.2 per cent rise in sales to Y38.1bn. Net profits rose 4.1 per cent to
Y4.1bn.
Seiyu, the supermarket chain belonging to the Seibu Saison group, reported
operating profits down 7.9 per cent to Y14.7bn. But it boosted pre-tax
profits by 1.5 per cent to Y7.5bn, while after-tax profits rose 3.1 per cent
to Y5.4bn.
Meitetsu Department Store, a medium-sized department store based in Nagoya,
reported a 4.8 per cent fall in six-month sales to Y49.5bn, its first ever
year-on-year fall.
However, the company unveiled an 18.1 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to
Y558m and a 24.5 per cent increase in after-tax profits to Y259m due to cost
reduction efforts.

DISSIDENT shareholders have forced Bank of New Zealand (BNZ) to hold an
extraordinary meeting to give further details of its financial affairs and
of National Australia Bank's NZDollars 1.5bn (Dollars 816m) takeover bid.
On two occasions, BNZ has secured waivers from the New Zealand Stock
Exchange to call such a meeting. However, the dissidents are now forcing BNZ
to call the meeting under its articles of association and section 136 of the
New Zealand Companies Act.
The dissidents - including two US shareholders with a combined 3 per cent
holding - say NAB's 80 cents-a-share offer is too low at a time when BNZ's
profitability appears to be improving. They have also criticised the level
of disclosure surrounding the takeover.
The dissidents are seeking, among others:
An explanation from BNZ of its restructuring following an independent report
by Baring Brothers Burrows, the UK-owned merchant bank, which said NAB's
offer was fair;
Details of Baring's brief when it was appointed independent adviser to the
offer; Disclosure of BNZ's first-half performance and future profitability.
Mr Syd Pasley, BNZ chairman, said yesterday the extraordinary meeting would
be held on October 30.

<TEXT>
ENGEN, the energy group in South Africa's Gencor group, performed in line
with market expectations to record an 18 per cent rise in earnings per share
for the year to August.
Turnover advanced by 7.6 per cent to R6.6bn (Dollars 2.3bn) from R6.1bn,
while operating income rose by 3.7 per cent to R393m from R379m.
Mr Rob Angel, chief executive, said the operating performance, which was
affected by lower refinery margins and a six-week shutdown to complete an
expansion programme, was 'gratifying'.
Taxable profits rose by 26.6 per cent to R533m from R421m reflecting the
benefits of the R1.1bn rights issue in May 1991 which boosted net financing
income to R140m from R42m. A lower tax bill of R107m, compared with R134m,
helped lift net income to R429m, a 50 per cent increase over the 1991 figure
of R286m.
The larger number of shares in issue restricted the earnings per share
increase to 18 per cent - up to 275 cents from 233 cents. The dividend was
raised by 18.5 per cent to 137.5 cents a share from 116 cents.
Mr Angel said sales in South Africa during the year had risen by about 2.6
per cent, with lighter products at the 'top' of the barrel (petrol, liquid
petroleum gas and jet fuel) increasing, while sales of products from the
'bottom' of the barrel (diesel, bitumen and lubricating oils) had fallen. He
said there was good potential for the petrol market, where industry sales
grew by 4 per cent during 1991-1992.
Mr Angel said a livery change from Mobil to Engen was proceeding well, with
average volume increases at the 16 changed stations of about 10 per cent.
Exports grew by 80 per cent during the year - up by 500 per cent in the last
three years. Exploration spending was up to R36m during the year from R20m.

price weakens

<TEXT>
GENGOLD, the gold mining subsidiary of South Africa's Gencor group, lifted
net profits by 3.2 per cent to R72.9m (Dollars 25.4m) in the September
quarter from R70.6m in the three months to June, despite producing less gold
and receiving a lower gold price.
The advance was largely attributable to a 1.5 per cent reduction in the cost
of gold produced to R27,099 per kg from R27,508 per kg in the June quarter.
This helped offset the fall in the gold price, which was R31,383 per kg in
the quarter compared with R32,071 per kg in the earlier quarter.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director, said the fall in the average gold price
had placed considerable pressure on the mines.
The 11 mines in the group produced 17,961kg of gold during the quarter,
compared with 18,091kg the previous quarter. The average grade was unchanged
at 5.6 grams per tonne of ore milled. At the after tax level, six of the
mines improved their performance compared to the June quarter.
Mr Maude said Gengold was planning its operations on the basis that there
would not be a significant increase in the gold price within the next two
years. He said most of the group's mines would be able to weather the
difficult period ahead.

domestic securities

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPUBLIC New York Corporation, the US banking group founded and controlled
by Swiss-based financier Mr Edmond Safra, said yesterday its securities
subsidiary had won approval from the Federal Reserve to conduct a
full-service securities brokerage business in the US.
The approval, granted last Friday, means Republic is one of the few US banks
allowed to operate in the domestic securities markets.
For more than half a century the commercial banking and securities
businesses have been kept strictly apart by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
Three years ago the Fed began to ease restrictions on banks with quality
balance sheets and strong capital positions. The first to be allowed into
the securities business were J P Morgan and Bankers Trust.
Republic, a group with Dollars 33bn in assets, is regarded by analysts as in
the same class. It has a reputation as an extremely conservative bank that
focuses on customer deposits rather than customer loans as its principal
product. This has enabled Republic to avoid many of the problems the rest of
the US banking industry has encountered with huge losses on bad loans.
Republic's subsidiary, Republic New York Securities, will begin operations
with an initial capitalisation of Dollars 100m, but will have to wait about
two weeks for its membership of the New York Stock Exchange to be approved
before it can open for business.
The parent company said its securities operation will provide full service
brokerage for institutional and retail customers, securities lending and
other securities credit activities and investment management.
Republic would not reveal further details, including whether its subsidiary
will underwrite stocks and bonds for corporate issuers.

DIGITAL Equipment, the struggling US computer manufacturer, reported
heavier-than-expected losses for its first fiscal quarter, citing weakness
in leading economies.
The loss for the quarter was Dollars 260.5m, or Dollars 2.04 per share,
compared with a net loss, after charges, of Dollars 474m, or Dollars 3.80,
in the first quarter last year. Revenues were Dollars 3.31bn, up 1 per cent
on last year.
'Weakness in the world's major economies continues to present difficult
challenges for our business and the information technology industry in
general,' said Mr John Smith, senior vice-president of operations. 'We
continue to eliminate costs in accordance with our recovery plan,' said Mr
William M. Steul, vice-president, finance.
Research and development spending declined by about 1.6 per cent on a
year-to-year basis, and the workforce was cut by 5,300 in the first quarter,
he added. 'We will continue our aggressive restructuring and cost reduction
efforts.'
Mr Robert Palmer, who succeeded Digital's founder, Mr Kenneth Olsen, as
president and chief executive last month, vowed to improve Digital's
financial performance.
'Digital will change,' he said. 'We are intent on ensuring that the customer
is the focus of everything that we do. Moreover, our shareholders and
customers want and expect us to be financially strong. Every activity that
we undertake is guided by the goals of customer focus and a return to
profitable growth.
Digital said revenues from its systems integration services, workstations,
personal computers, integration software and network applications support
products grew during the quarter.

FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Bear Stearns follows industry
trend

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BEAR Stearns, the Wall Street broking house, yesterday unveiled fiscal
first-quarter earnings of Dollars 63m, substantially higher than a year ago
but well below the extremely strong profits of the previous two quarters. At
the same stage last year, the firm earned Dollars 47.1m.
Bear Stearns' earnings repeated a pattern seen at most big Wall Street firms
in the current reporting season, with strong trading and investment banking
earnings offsetting weak brokerage business.
Revenues from own-account trading jumped sharply, rising 41 per cent to
Dollars 250.7m, due to favourable conditions in international financial
markets. Investment banking revenues rose 15.3 per cent to Dollars 62.4m in
the wake of a busy corporate securities underwriting calendar.
Interest income, however, was sharply lower at Dollars 204.5m in the wake of
further declines in domestic interest rates, and broking commissions were
virtually flat at Dollars 84.9m following reduced investor activity in the
stock markets over the summer.
Total corporate expenses rose 20 per cent between July and September to
Dollars 330.5m, primarily due to a big increase in employee pay and benefits
linked to market performance and profitability.
During the quarter the company bought 1.6m shares of its common stock, worth
about Dollars 25m, for a deferred compensation plan for senior managing
directors.

COCA-COLA, the US soft drinks company, yesterday followed the example set by
PepsiCo, its main US rival, with a strong third-quarter earnings gain.
The Atlanta-based group posted an 18.5 per cent rise in after-tax profits,
to Dollars 540.6m, and a 20.6 per cent improvement in earnings per share, at
41 cents. Sales were 10.6 per cent higher at Dollars 3.51bn.
Coca-Cola said the rise in third-quarter marketing expenditure was in line
with the growth in gross profit, but that margins had improved.
In the US, unit volume sales to retail bottle/can and fountain customers
grew by over 2 per cent, while gallon shipments of concentrates and syrups
increased by 1 per cent during the third quarter.
In north-east Europe and Africa, the figures were 10 per cent and 5 per cent
respectively; in the European Community, 6 per cent and 2 per cent; in the
Pacific region, 1 per cent and a fall of 6 per cent in gallon shipments; and
in Latin America, flat unit case volumes and a 1 per cent decline in gallon
shipments.
For the first nine months of the year, after-tax profits were Dollars 1.5bn,
a 19.5 per cent improvement on the Dollars 1.26bn seen in the same period of
1991. Sales for the first three quarters were up by 13.1 per cent at Dollars
9.83bn.

third quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of New York, which last spring agreed to buy more than 60 branches from
the US subsidiary of Barclays Bank, yesterday unveiled an impressive 66.1
per cent jump in third-quarter net earnings, to Dollars 98m.
The profits rise - which translates into earnings per share of Dollars 1.07
against 72 cents a year ago - was attributed to stronger fee income, wider
interest spreads, cuts in operating expenses and reduced bad debt
provisions.
Net income for the first nine months of 1992 was Dollars 264m, or Dollars
3.09 per share, compared with Dollars 56m, or 45 cents, in the same period
of last year. Last year's results included a Dollars 343m bad debt
provision.
Non-performing assets, excluding Third World loans, were Dollars 13m lower
at Dollars 906m. This brought the percentage of non-performing assets
against total assets down to 3.6 per cent from 5.3 per cent a year ago.
Total bad debt provisions in the third quarter were Dollars 105m, compared
with Dollars 252m.
Net interest income rose to Dollars 325m in the third quarter, compared with
Dollars 314m a year ago. Non-interest income was 10 per cent higher,
year-on-year, at Dollars 297m.
Bank of New York's share price was marked Dollars 1 higher to Dollars 45 1/8
, a high for the year.

FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Ames to sue Wertheim Schroder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMES Department Stores, the US retail chain operating under Chapter 11 of
the bankruptcy code, yesterday launched a multi-million dollar lawsuit
against Wertheim Schroder, the New York-based investment bank and its
chairman, Mr James Harmon. Wertheim Schroder is 42.5 per cent-owned by
London's Schroder Wagg.
The retailer is seeking to recover damages in excess of Dollars 375m, plus
investment banking fees of over Dollars 20m.
It accuses Wertheim Schroder of breach of fiduciary duty, professional
malpractice, unjust enrichment and other improper conduct, in connection
with Ames' Dollars 1.3bn purchase of the discount stores division of Zayre
Corporation in 1988.
The suit also alleges Mr Harmon, who chaired the Ames board between January
1988 and June 1990 and headed Wertheim Schroder, breached his fiduciary duty
during the deal.
Ames bought the loss-making discount stores division in October 1988. It was
a highly-leveraged transaction, financed partly by a Dollars 900m loan
package. In the suit, Ames claims the 'enormous losses' from the Zayre
stores and the inability to service the associated debt burden,
'substantially caused' Ames to file for bankruptcy protection 18 months
later.
Wertheim was a long-standing adviser to Ames, and Mr Harmon had been on the
Ames board for over 20 years. Wertheim was also investment banker to Zayre
and, the suit alleges, 'had been advising Zayre on various refinancing and
restructuring options' since late-1987.
The lawsuit alleges Wertheim was 'fully aware that Zayre privately had
valued the (discount stores division) at far less than the purchase price
that Zayre had proposed to Ames and that Zayre might be willing to accept a
purchase price hundreds of millions of dollar below the price sought from
Ames'.
'Nevertheless, Wertheim concealed these matters, or failed to fully disclose
these matter to Ames,' claims the suit.
Ames alleges Mr Harmon and the investment bank tried to protect themselves
against claims of a conflict of interests 'through several transparently
self-serving devices'.
These, alleges the suit, included calling in Bear Stearns, another
investment bank, to provide a fairness opinion, but giving the second
adviser insufficient time and information to complete the task.
Wertheim claimed the suit was totally without merit and would be contested.
It said the discount stores acquisition was 'extensively reviewed by Ames
and its board of directors' and its own role 'which was full disclosed and
acknowledged by Ames in its written engagement of Wertheim Schroder, was
entirely appropriate'.
'Furthermore, at our suggestion, each company retained separate investment
banks to review the transaction and provide fairness opinions,' the bank
said.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (20): New window
of opportunity - Satellite earth stations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASKED what was the most important factor affecting their investment
decisions in eastern Germany, most German businessmen in a newspaper poll
this summer said it was the availability of good telecommunications links.
A follow-up question might have been along the lines of 'how easy is it to
get hold of good telecommunications links in the region?'
The answers would have ranged from 'not very easy' to 'almost impossible.'
It is not that Deutsche Telekom has neglected its responsibilities. The
state-owned German company is investing massively in the old GDR. By 1997,
it will have ploughed DM70bn into the modernisation of the east German
network in just seven years. And, by the turn of the century,
telecommunications links will be equally good in east and west Germany.
But for German businesses who have had to cope with an overloaded,
antiquated telephone service since unification in 1990, the promise of
better telecommunications in the future offers little comfort. It is their
short-term needs that have given companies like the Hanover-based Teleport
Europe the opportunity to sell business communications services using a
satellite technology which has been popular in the United States for some
time but has failed to make an impact in the UK.
The technology is based on small satellite earth stations called 'vsats'
(very small aperture terminals). A typical user of vsats would have anything
from I0 to 500 earth stations - one serving each part of the network - and
each one connected via a central hub or office.
Information can then be passed from one vsat to another by bouncing signals
off a geo-stationary satellite located some 22,500 metres above the Earth's
equator.
Vsats provide an alternative to data communications networks based on packet
switching technology. These are known as X25 networks, and have been rolled
out over much of western Europe. They are currently cheaper and of higher
quality than vsat networks. Vsats are also used for video, and while voice
communications are possible, there are a number of technical difficulties.
The opening of eastern Europe, where it will take years to build up the
telephone networks to the standards of western Europe has provided a window
of opportunity for vsats. A vsat network is a stand-alone system, so it does
not rely on the existence of a modern telecommunications infrastructure. It
can also be installed in days, whereas a dedicated terrestrial X25
pan-European network can take months to deliver.
Vsats are ideal, therefore, in eastern Europe where fixed telecommunications
infrastructures were falling apart at the end of the 1980s, following years
of neglect during Communism. A role for vsats was recognised by the German
government shortly after reunification, and in 1990, it started awarding
licences to private companies to offer vsat services to businesses in
eastern and western Germany. Vsat service providers were allowed to offer
voice as well as data services - the first time that Deutsche Telekom
monopoly in the provision of basic voice services had been broken. In all,
26 licences have been awarded in Germany since 1990.
A report by the UK consultants CIT Research, published in July, forecasts
that by the year 2001 eastern Europe will account for 51 per cent of
installed vsats for two-way business communications services. But vsats are
also beginning to find a market in western Europe among multinationals which
need networks up and running quicker than would be possible with a dedicated
X25 system.
Holiday Inn, the US hotel group, is having a vsat network for its European
hotels installed by MCI, the US long-distance telephone operator.
The German car giant Daimler Benz has its 20 European subsidiaries linked
with a vsat network supplied by Deutsche Telekom, while Renault in France is
to set up a vsat network connecting its dealers across Europe.
The network, which is being supplied by Teleport Europe, will be used for
data and business television. Renault considers that vsats could be less
expensive and more reliable in the long run than terrestrial X25. Volkswagen
and Ford are monitoring the success of the Renault system.
Large users in Europe often complain about the high price of vsat systems.
But Jon Collins, the managing director of the European office of AT&amp;T
Tridom, the US vsat manufacturer, says that 'because the majority of the
cost is in the central office, its cost is diluted across the network.'
For companies like Renault, therefore, which has thousands of dealers in
Europe, vsats could work out cheaper than X25.
Installing a vsat network in every European country can, however, be
difficult. Austria, Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and
Switzerland do not give licences to companies like Teleport Europe to
provide business services by satellite. If a company wanted a vsat network
in one of these countries, it would have to go to the PTT - if, that is, the
PTT is prepared to sell it a vsat network rather than an X25 terrestrial
network.
The regulatory environment is, however, changing and Collins reckons that at
the start of next year, Spain, Italy and Greece will move towards
deregulation.
Meanwhile, Teleport Europe is managing to supply its customers in France and
Germany with Europe-wide vsat networks by negotiating with the PTTs or
regulatory authorities in different countries and in some cases, working
with the PTT.
Regulatory constraints have been one of the main reasons behind the slow
growth in satellite business services in Europe. Jon Chaplin, a
telecommunications expert at the European Space Agency, estimates that the
satellite share of the Ecu 85bn European telecommunications services market
is only 0.5 per cent (Dollars 440m).
In the United States, satellites account for two per cent of total
telecommunications revenue.
But CIT Research estimate that by the year 2001, total revenues for
satellite business services in Europe will have increased from Ecu 270m in
1991 to Ecu 1bn. CIT is also forecasting that in 10 years time, there will
be 130,000 vsat terminals in Europe.
Today, it is estimated that there are between 65 and 75 vsat networks in
Europe comprising roughly 2,500 individual two-way terminals.

FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Bush deftly breaches China trade wall -
Republicans trumpet deal with Beijing as victory for the president's
policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR President George Bush it was one of the brighter moments in the
televised candidates' debate on Sunday night: with his domestic economic
policies under attack, the president was at least able to claim a new
success for his China trade policy.
'I am the one that said let's keep the MFN (most-favoured-nation trading
status) because you see China moving towards a free market economy. But
Governor (Bill) Clinton's philosophy is isolate them. He says don't do it,
but the policies he's expounding of putting conditions on MFN and kind of
humiliating them is not the way you make the kind of progress we are
getting.'
On October 10, the day before the debate, Beijing capitulated to US demands
for reforms which would allow greater access to their market for foreign
goods. Under threat of nearly Dollars 4bn in retaliatory sanctions by the US
on its exports, China agreed to:
Publication of all laws, regulations, policies and guidance on the operation
of its import/export system.
Removal of most quotas, import restrictions, import licensing requirements
and import controls according to a strict timetable.
'Significant' tariff reduction on a wide range of products including foods,
chemicals, iron and steel products, photographic materials, machinery,
cosmetics, confectionery and electrical parts.
Publication of all previously inaccessible commercial information on sales
and marketing opportunities.
A ban on import substitution measures, the requirement of technology
transfer or local investment as conditions for investment.
Establishment of an expert working group to discuss health and sanitary
standards for farm products. Agreement to eliminate within one year any
scientifically unjustifiable restrictions that obstruct trade.
This was the third US trade triumph over China this year. In January, under
pressure of a deadline and threats of sanctions totalling Dollars 750m,
Beijing agreed to take action to protect foreign patents, copyrights,
trademarks and trade secrets. In June, the US and China signed a memorandum
of understanding allowing US embassy officials to visit Chinese prisons if
they suspected they were producing goods for exports to the US.
The new agreement commits China to phase out import barriers in many key
sectors beginning on December 31 1992, and continuing until December 31
1997. These openings are expected to increase imports of a range of goods
from vehicles, computers, and steel to beer, wine, and mineral water.
Governor Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, said China's
promise to lower its trade barriers was the right thing to do in view of its
Dollars 15bn trade surplus with the US.
Furthermore, he said the Bush administration had gottough with China only
because it was pressured to do so by Democrats in Congress.
While there is truth in this charge, the administration's resolve was also
stiffened by the soaring trade deficit with China.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, can be credited with deftly
executing the policy with an eye to Chinese sensitivities. President Bush's
promise to Democrats in 1991 to 'work actively' for Taiwan's admission to
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was never fulfilled. Instead, the
US has passed to the EC the negotiating lead on Taiwan's admission to Gatt,
while Mrs Hills held out the promise of US support for China's Gatt
membership in exchange for co-operation on trade reforms.
In an official statement accompanying the agreement on Saturday, she was a
graceful winner. 'In bringing its practices into line with international
practice, China will help achieve its own goal of becoming a full member of
the international trading system. It is a win-win situation.'
The market access pact, while widely praised by the US business community,
will not entirely dispel the view promoted by Governor Clinton that the
president 'coddles' the Chinese leadership.
He has promised support for legislation passed this year by the Democratic
majority Congress but vetoed by President Bush. It would make China's MFN
status (which gives it the lowest tariffs on offer to any US trading
partner) conditional on an annual presidential determination that China was
improving its human rights performance. To encourage a continuation of
China's private sector reforms, MFN status would be lost only for goods
produced in the state sector.
The Bush administration argues that the plan is unworkable because the goods
could come from anywhere. Democrats say origin can be determined and point
to the Customs Services' tracking of Chinese goods transhipped through third
countries and goods produced by prison labour.
'If we can stand up for our economics, we ought to be able to preserve the
democratic interests of the people in China,' he said in the debate, 'and
over the long run they will be more reliable partners.'

<TEXT>
AIR Nippon, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways, said yesterday it would buy
15 B737-300 Boeing aircraft for an estimated Y80bn (Pounds 373m).
The Japanese regional airline said a selection committee, after 'exhaustive
evaluations', had chosen the model ahead of the Airbus A319, the British
Aerospace 146, the Fokker F100 and the McDonnell Douglas MD87.
Government officials insist that aircraft purchases are made on the grounds
of quality, and not politics, but the European Community has complained that
some purchases appear to be designed to appease Washington.
The EC has become more concerned as Japan's trade surplus with the US has
risen, apparently putting more pressure on the country's airlines to
increase purchases of US equipment.

FT  15 OCT 92 / World Trade News: US-EC farm talks choke on oilseeds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO days of intensive negotiations in Brussels have failed to resolve the
European Community's dispute with the US over the EC oilseed subsidy regime
 -the biggest obstacle to settlement of the Uruguay Round of talks on world
trade liberalisation.
'We are still worried about oilseeds, not just because it is the biggest
problem, but because there is so little time to settle it,' one trade
official said. The EC is unwilling to cut oilseed output below 9.5m tonnes,
while US farm lobbies want a 7m tonne ceiling.
Nevertheless officials said the Brussels talks had narrowed the gap between
the US and the EC on a farm trade dispute that has prevented agreement on
wider trade reform for almost two years.
Of three disputed issues, two appear to have been resolved in principle  -
that on a six-year programme of cuts in the volume of the EC's subsidised
farm exports, and on EC demands for compensation payments to European
farmers for production cuts to be exempt from wider commitments to cut
subsidies for domestic production.
The oilseeds dispute, which threatens to erupt into fully-fledged trade war,
remains unresolved. Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC Farm Commissioner, and Mr Ed
Madigan, his US counterpart, are to meet within a week in a last-ditch
effort to reach agreement.
Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative who led the US negotiating
team, abandoned plans to visit Paris - where opposition to EC concessions
has been fiercest - and returned to Washington yesterday. She plans to
continue talks with Mr Frans Andriessen, her EC counterpart, at a trade
ministers' meeting in Canada at the weekend.
In Germany, members of the Bundestag yesterday condemned French efforts to
block a Uruguay Round agreement as 'intolerable'.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (17): Doubts over
the 'Holy Grail' - Integrated services digital network / ISDN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE BLACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Integrated Services Digital Network was once seen as the holy grail of
business telecommunications, but now it looks as if it may become just one
of a number of possible solutions.
Digitisation of the old analogue telephone system will provide some
important benefits, but the ISDN superstructure of digital network services
may not become all-pervasive.
Thus the hopes of the European Commission, the telephone companies and some
governments may therefore be disappointed and the predictions of many
industry analysts overturned.
ISDN was conceived 20 years ago by the International Consultative Committee
of Telegraph and Telephone (CCITT) as an all-embracing system for public
communications. But it proved such an enormous task that it was to some
extent overtaken by events, notably the spread of private networks.
ISDN is now said to be available to 90 per cent of UK businesses in most
towns and cities. It offers clearer lines, faster connections, greater
reliability and lower costs for calls. It is up to six times faster than the
old technology, with data calls being made at 64K bits per second.
File transfer is one of the principal applications. An ISDN link can be set
up in a second and a half, whereas a modem link might take 15 seconds. A
file which takes a minute to send by modem could be sent by ISDN in only 15
seconds. Also, a modem might need to dial several times to get a connection,
whereas an ISDN call should connect first time. ISDN is therefore eroding
the sales of modems, the analogue devices used to translate and send
information between computers across the phone lines.
But Mr Mark Orchart, marketing manager for Cray Communications (formerly
Dowty Information Systems) says that sales of modems to smaller companies
are holding up well because ISDN remains largely a club for large
corporations.
BT's business development marketing manager, Mr Tony Corris says that around
1,200 UK companies were using its ISDN services in June. These were mainly
large companies and some small firms with a publishing operation which
involves a need to send a lot of data and colour graphics to a tight
timetable.
But Mr Corris acknowledges that medium-sized companies on the whole have not
so far taken up these services.
There are several reasons why ISDN has not spread as quickly as forecast. Mr
Keith Mallinson, principal analyst with market researchers Yankee Group
Europe, suggests there is an underlying conflict of interest between the
suppliers and the users.
The service is most appealing to an organisation such as a bank with many
branches around the country or a retailer which needs to poll its stores
during the night to pick up the previous day's transaction data. But it is
precisely these services to remote areas, he points out, which are least
profitable for the suppliers. Also, the adoption of ISDN by users can damage
the telephone company's income from other sources, such as leased lines.
Both BT and Mercury are offering attractive tariffs for ISDN compared to
those for the old analogue system. But the initial cost of equipment to
connect to ISDN is still too high, there are cheaper alternative methods of
communication, and there are still no international standards.
A meeting this month of the North American ISDN Users Forum could produce an
international standard for the application program interface, which could
give an important stimulus to the market.
Mercury's entry level has now been lowered to only 15 lines, which may bring
the system within the reach of more small and medium-sized users. They could
benefit from ISDN because they have been unable to afford to set up their
own private networks.
All European Community countries are obliged to introduce ISDN, but the
speed at which they are doing so is related to the status of the telephone
company in each country and its national political position.
Those in regulated environments, which means most of Europe's telephone
companies, may have an incentive to invest heavily in ISDN and pass as much
as possible of the massive cost on to customers.
In the process, they acquire a strategic asset which may help them against
new competitors in the event of deregulation.
Those working in a more commercial environment may be less keen on incurring
the cost of developing ISDN.
Thus, the telephone companies in France and Germany are able to force the
pace more than BT and the growth of ISDN in those countries in the past year
has been impressive.
In the US, growth has been patchy but a big promotional exercise next month
should bring a new wave of take-up during next year.
There is a rising demand for international ISDN connections. Mr Luke Broome,
manager of business telephony for Mercury, says this demand comes mainly
from large companies looking for cheaper and more flexible ways of
video-conferencing.
BT has ISDN routes to 20 countries now and Mercury has recently launched its
first ISDN routes to the US and Hongkong. Virtually all the business centres
worldwide will be accessible within the next year. These international
routes will also be used for backing up private business networks, for
faster, improved-quality faxes and for higher quality voice transmission for
broadcasters.
It is arguable that expectations of the growth rate of ISDN were set too
high from the start, that it will fulfil its promise but over a longer
period. Even in the more advanced US market, ISDN only began to find
applications in 1990, led by a group of the largest companies.
The spread of new applications, especially those in multimedia (combined
audio, video and data), such as video-conferencing and the videophone, could
transform the industry in the next few years. ISDN may be, after all, still
just waiting for these things to happen.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (19): Saving time
and effort - The versatility of voice mail systems offers big benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MORANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the challenges of international trade is the limited daily 'time
window' between businesses on opposite sides of the globe.
Even in one time zone, a very large number of telephone calls are
unsuccessful - either the line is engaged; or the person being called is at
a meeting and not at his or her desk. And even when the person is in the
right location, they may not - after all - have the information required,
with the result that yet another telephone call is required.
This problem with 'telephone-tag,' as it is widely known, is exacerbated
when dealing with people who are in different time zones which means there
is only a limited time-window.
For this reason, voice mail is increasingly being used, both nationally and
internationally, to enhance business communications and thus efficiency. But
voice mail comes in all 'flavours' ranging upwards from the basic 'vanilla.'
In many ways, voice processing is an extension of the principle of the
telephone-answering machine - except that as it is under computer control
and connected to the telephone system a voice processing systems can do a
lot more.
Systems may be connected to a company's PABX for the benefit of both
internal and external users; or to the public network - ordinary or cellular
 -where the network operator is providing what is, in effect, a bureau
service.
The biggest of the voice processing business so far has been in these public
bureau services, such as BT's Voicebank, which gives individuals a telephone
number on which people can leave messages for them, and VoiceCom, which is
aimed at the corporate messaging market.
In the US and Canada, there were 2.3m subscribers to public voice processing
services in 1991, according to a recent report by BIS Strategic Decisions.
Some 3bn messages were left on the systems and operators earned a revenue of
around Dollars 825m.
In Europe, growth has been slower, according to BIS. There being about
278,0000 subscribers to public systems, receiving rather fewer calls per
mailbox. The revenue was Dollars 148m - and rather more per subscriber,
perhaps reflecting a less-competitive market.
Advanced voice mail systems allow the recipient to easily reply to a
message; or to append a note to it and either copy it or forward it to one
or more other people.
In fact, just as with conventional office memos, voice mail can be sent to
an individual or there can be circulation lists.
Recipients act upon, reply and forward the memo (with or without appended
notes) for action, as required.
A good example of a company which recognises the need for effective
communications is PC software company, WordPerfect, which is well-known for
the quality of its customer support.
The company uses a Brite VM2000 voice messaging system which claims to
ensure that 'telephone calls, whether internal or external are always
answered.
'The caller also gets information to enable him to make an intelligent
response: leave a message, call again at another time, and so on . . '
Similarly, British Petroleum has recently installed a VMX system at its
London headquarters with the aim of improving the productivity of staff who
spend a high proportion of their time on the phone, whilst providing a more
efficient service to both customers and suppliers.
BP's special projects manager says the new system 'puts control of the
telephone into our own hands. It helps save time and effort spent on mundane
and time-consuming tasks, such as message-taking and answering colleagues'
constantly ringing phones.'
However, to make best advantage of voice mail, the facilities should be
available across the whole organisation. Here, a problem may arise where a
network - frequently as a result of take-overs and mergers - contains a
variety of different PABXs and incompatible voice mail products.
Nigel Harte, Mercury's business manager for voice processing, comments: 'In
the very near future, the implementation of AMIS (audio message interchange
specification), the voice mail equivalent of OSI, will enable feature
transparency between different manufacturer's systems.'
This will be an important step because, at present, messages can generally
only be forwarded across a network made up of similar systems.
Nigel Harte explains that AMIS was originally mooted in the US by the
manufacturer of voice processing systems, VMX; Coca Cola; and the PABX
manufacturer, Rolm. Since then, the Voice Messaging User-interface Forum
(VMUIF) has been set up to act as the standards body.
The forum is attracting a growing number of other suppliers, such as Octel
Communications, and operators have joined.
The versatility of voice mail can be seen from the 'Virtual Telephone,' (VT)
developed by Octel in conjunction with Brazilian telecommunications
operator, Telebras.
The VT is intended for parts of the country where there is a long waiting
list for telephones.
Using the system, which is implemented on an Octel voice mail system,
callers can leave detailed messages in a mailbox.
Each VT-user carries a pager so that, when a message reaches his mailbox, he
is bleeped and can then go to the nearest phone in which can be retrieved by
the Virtual Telephone owner from any phone, including pay phones.
Thus, most of the benefits of an actual individual telephone can be rapidly
provided by the administration - at a fraction of the cost, and in a manner
which will not become obsolete even when the number of telephones grows.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (18): A vision of
the future - Broadband communication
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the year 2000. The basic tools of people working in offices are
voice-activated terminals capable of mixing speech, text, data and
full-motion, full-colour video at will. Connections between any of the
world's business centres are virtually instantaneous.
After work, people relax in their homes by accessing central video or audio
databases containing all the films and music ever recorded worldwide: the
conventional videotape and compact disc are endangered species. This is the
broadband vision of the future.
Billions of research dollars, not to mention the reputations of some of the
world's foremost telecommunications, computing and networking companies, are
being staked on efforts to convert the vision into reality.
Scepticism is widespread, but the broadband beat goes on regardless.
Broadband communication is basically about speed of information processing
and transfer. Frame relay, a new, fast packet data transmission technology
being introduced in around 14 European countries ranging from Czechoslovakia
to the UK, operates at speeds up to 2m information bits per second.
True broadband technology, such as asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), will
run at speeds seventy times higher. Higher speeds do not simply mean that
existing tasks can be transacted much faster.
Indeed, it is probable that broadband technology will initially be
cost-justified only in new, high capacity applications. Part of the
challenge, according to Stephen Harbour, marketing director of GPT's
Telecommunications Systems Group, is to identify these new applications.
One starting-point for the broadband story is the recent and dramatic growth
of personal computer-based local area networks, (LANs). To give an example,
California-based Market Intelligence Research Corporation says that the
European PC LAN market will expand from Dollars 6.8bn in 1991 to over
Dollars 10bn in 1997 at a compound annual rate of 18 per cent. Following on
from the expansion of the installed LAN base is the requirement to
interconnect several LANs in remote locations, either as metropolitan area
networks (MANs) or wide area networks (WANs). Existing LAN traffic can be
interconnected by a variety of means.
At relatively low speeds, LAN links use packet switched data technology,
narrowband ISDN and bandwidth compression, in which signals are compressed
so that more can be squeezed on to a telecom circuit.
Bandwidth on demand, in which users dial-up extra capacity as and when it is
required, is another solution. Operators in around 12 European countries
presently offer this service, and talks are underway with a number of North
American carriers to expand its availability.
For very high speed LAN interconnection, industry has developed frame relay
and what is termed the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI). The latter,
from the US, is the fastest LAN standard so far devised, operating at 100m
information bits per second. However, many experts do not believe that
either frame relay or FDDI have the flexibility to support multi-media
service.
Multi-media is a method of transporting and processing text, data, images
and voice, and presenting the results on a screen in an integrated format.
'Multi-media computing will soon take the world by storm and will have an
enormous effect on how we do business in the next few years,' says Ralph
Ungermann, president of networking specialists Ungermann-Bass at last year's
Dataquest European Telecommunications Industry Conference.
'It will be what leads the networking industry, as well as the computer
industry, into the next decade.'
Multi-media will be used in interactive training, publishing, financial
services, healthcare, point of sale and video conferencing, as well as in a
whole range of general desk-top office applications.
A study by the Frost &amp; Sullivan market research concern estimates that the
European multi-media business was worth around Dollars 1.5bn in 1990 and
will rise to Dollars 3.06bn by 1996. Ungermann-Bass believes that ATM is one
of the best candidates to handle multi-media.
The UK's GPT views ATM as a means of moving information around the public
telephone network as well as presenting high bandwidth multi-media to the
desk top - 'it's both a desk-top and a backbone trunk technology,' comments
Stephen Harbour.
Through its Stromberg Carlson affiliate, GPT and its partner Siemens have
delivered trial ATM-like broadband systems to six US telecom carriers - MCI,
PacTel, US West, Ameritech, Bell Atlantic and Southwestern Bell. The duo are
also working on similar projects in Germany, Denmark, Ireland, Italy,
Austria and Sweden. GPT has detected variations in the application of ATM
from country to country.
'The US has focused exclusively on high-speed data applications, whilst
Europe has had more emphasis on the universal use of ATM,' notes Mr Harbour.
'Different operators and users are initially using ATM to solve different
problems.'
One of the most ambitious ATM programmes anywhere in the world has launched
in Japan; in early 1991, the country's dominant carrier Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone (NTT) selected AT&amp;T International, Northern Telecom and Siemens,
along with seven Japanese vendors, to jointly develop ATM equipments to
function as main elements in its future broadband ISDN (B-ISDN).
The original plan was to replace NTT's existing trunk telephone
infrastructure by ATM-based B-ISDN facilities in the year 2005, and to
furnish all subscribers with broadband access, through fibre optic
connections to their homes, around ten years later.
In recent months, NTT has been back-peddling on its B-ISDN plans, citing the
dent in its profits caused by the operations of the country's enlarging base
of competitive carriers. NTT is also thought now to be reluctant to carry
Japan's estimated Dollars 260bn B-ISDN investment burden all by itself.
Nevertheless, the company has begun experimenting with broadband extensions
to its narrowband ISDN services. Among business offerings being trialled are
'soft' fax, which electronically files messages for display on a PC or
electronic display board, data retrieval from an optical mass storage system
at the rate of two seconds a page.
For the general user, NTT is looking at video pay-phones, and imagery and
voice stored in a central database which can be replayed as part of foreign
language conversation lessons, or used in tourist information systems. NTT
is a past-master at commercialising new telecom services, but a question
mark remains over the extent and timing of the materialisation of a high
volume, global market for B-ISDN services. GPT believes that, as will
narrowband ISDN, much of the demand for B-ISDN is latent. High tech
businesses are spending huge sums of money on getting their products to
market faster than previously. According to Stephen Harbour, this is
increasing the requirement for business-to-business interconnection: 'Faster
time-to-market, which is one of the most important things that modern
businesses are working on, is achieved with inter-business links not
intra-business links.'
The opportunity is for public operators to use ATM products to carry these
inter-business services: 'The public network operator will always be able to
amortize the capital cost of these things more effectively over a higher
number of users, and in particular in things like transmission and databases
where the ownership of data is less important than access to it,' argues Mr
Harbour.
Mercury Communications instances computer-aided design/computer-aided
manufacturing, insurance, finance and healthcare as ATM applications which
exist now, but believes that the broadband market won't start to ramp up for
another three or four years.
'The applications exist, but some of them are fairly specialised. It will
really take off when there are more general applications,' concludes Alison
Lockyer, the company's broadband networks product manager.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (3): Fuelling controversy -
BNFL's new reprocessing plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLY next year British Nuclear Fuels, the state-owned manufacturer and
reprocessor of nuclear fuel, will pass an important milestone with the
commissioning of its new Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant (Thorp) at
Sellafield in Cumbria.
Although the project is years behind schedule and above its original budget,
the plant will ensure BNFL retains its position as one of the world's
leading nuclear fuel operators.
Costing Pounds 1.85bn, Thorp has the capacity to reprocess 1,200 tonnes a
year of spent fuel, separate the uranium and plutonium, and transform the
rest into a manageable form of waste. From the UK taxpayer's point of view,
the project is a good one in so far as Thorp has been financed with upfront
fees from its (mainly overseas) clients, and its earnings should make a
healthy contribution to the balance of payments. Its order books are full
for the next 14 years.
But the project has also been launched into controversy about the merits of
reprocessing when alternatives such as long-term storage of spent fuel have
attractions of their own.
Until now, BNFL's reprocessing capacity has focused almost exclusively on
Magnox fuels from the first generation of UK nuclear power stations, many of
which are reaching the end of their useful lives. Thorp will enable BNFL to
reprocess the oxide fuels which are used by newer generations of power
stations, including the pressurised water reactors. This will enable it to
hold its own against its only principal competitor, Cogema of France.
The decision to go ahead with Thorp reflects the UK government view that
reprocessing is a worthwhile market niche even though many of the original
assumptions underlying it have since changed. The world is no longer short
of either uranium or plutonium. Rather the opposite: there is now concern
that they are both in dangerous abundance. The military need for plutonium
has also receded.
This reduces the case for Thorp to the environmental one of whether
reprocessing is a cleaner way of dealing with spent fuel than simply storing
it, and the commercial one of whether it makes business sense.
In support of reprocessing, BNFL has made much of the two large contracts it
recently signed with Nuclear Electric, the operator of 12 power stations in
England and Wales, and Scottish Nuclear its counterpart north of the border
with two stations. Sir Christopher Harding, its outgoing chairman, said at
the time: 'Our future income is largely secured.'
But while this seemed like a convincing endorsement, both nuclear operators
made clear the contracts covered only existing commitments. The future was a
different matter. Scottish Nuclear said it prefers long-term storage, and
has lodged an application to build a store. Nuclear Electric has decided to
store fuel from its newest reactor, Sizewell B.
Both companies are concerned about the cost of reprocessing. The combined
cost of their contracts is Pounds 17bn over 15 years, though a portion of
this includes fuel manufacture. Nuclear energy remains an expensive source
of power, so anything that can be done to reduce costs will strengthen its
long-term prospects - and storage, so Scottish Nuclear's chairman James Hann
argues, is cheaper than reprocessing.
BNFL is sensitive to criticisms about cost, which it blames on past
management's practice of insisting on cost-plus contracts which gave it no
incentive to perform efficiently. The company is now going over to the
stronger discipline of fixed price contracts where profit is commensurate
with holding down own costs.
From the environmental standpoint there are worries about the risks in
transporting spent fuel to the reprocessing site and the actual reprocessing
itself. At the end of the day, reprocessing still leaves waste to be
disposed of, albeit in a treated form.
Mr John Guinness, the new chairman of BNFL, maintains that the trend towards
storage does not affect the fundamentals of his business. 'This is a
postponement of a decision rather than a final one,' he says.
Not that the doubts about reprocessing will have any immediate effect on
BNFL's business. With its order books full and many foreign nuclear
operators under pressure to ship out their untreated waste, BNFL need not
fear any drop in custom. Furthermore, the world's reprocessing capacity is
equivalent to only half the amount of spent fuel discharged each year by
nuclear power stations. This imbalance will be redressed slightly early in
the next century when Japan completes a new plant of its own.
Mr Guinness's task will be to ensure that BNFL can preserve its
profitability in a tougher environment. In its latest financial year, it
earned Pounds 161m, up Pounds 5m on the year before, and paid a Pounds 52m
dividend to the government. Its export sales rose 50 per cent to Pounds
268m.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (4): Underground plans hit
snags - Chris Tighe discusses Nirex and the Sellafield repository proposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YOU DO not have to be an optimist to work for UK Nirex but it must help.
After more than a decade of presentations to hostile communities, the
nuclear industry's waste consortium announced in July last year it had
selected Sellafield as the preferred site for its proposed Pounds 2.5bn
repository half a mile underground for low and intermediate level nuclear
waste.
The decision to focus on the West Cumbrian community which has co-operated
with, and defended, the nuclear industry for 40 years came as no surprise,
even though Nirex preferred to stress the area's geological potential and
the fact that proximity to the Sellafield nuclear waste reprocessing site,
source of 60 per cent of the waste to be stored, makes logistical sense.
But local opinion, although supportive of British Nuclear Fuels, has proved
less willing to embrace Nirex.
In the 15 months since Nirex selected a site next to BNFL's Sellafield
plant, the project has hit planning problems over test boreholes in the
nearby Lake District National Park, been through an above-ground redesign to
make the plans more visually acceptable to local people, and undergone a
rejigging which has now led to the decision to build an underground rock
laboratory.
Nirex had planned to file a planning application this autumn for the
repository, in the hope of beginning underground investigations in 1995 and
getting the repository operative in 2005.
It is intended to operate for 50 years, taking up to 2m cubic metres of
waste. In April, however, the Radioactive Waste Management Advisory
Committee said more geological study was needed for the long-term safety
case, and in June Nirex announced a year's delay because knowledge of the
site's hydrogeology was 'not sufficiently firm'.
The general picture, said Nirex, was 'so far, so good' but independent
consultants Environmental Resources, in a report for Cumbria County Council,
said their interpretation of early borehole results suggested the proposed
site was in a mixing zone between incoming saline water and groundwater,
which was being forced up through the basement rock towards the aquifer
sandstone above.
Now Nirex has said it will seek permission next year for a rock laboratory.
Managing director Mr Michael Folger says 2006 or 2007 is now the target date
for repository operation but adds: 'We're very conscious there's a lot
outside our control.'
Given that the rock lab itself could go to public inquiry, 2007 looks
optimistic.
The lab has been seen by some locals as a 'trojan horse'; others, who have
feared Nirex wanted to press on too fast at Sellafield, welcome it but
wonder if it will yield the anticipated results. 'I think in five years it
will be a large puddle of water,' predicts Copeland conservative councillor
Norman Murphy, a retired colonel living in Gosforth, the community most
affected.
Nirex insists it will not press ahead with the repository if it has serious
concern about the site.
High level waste is not destined for the repository; it is being vitrified
and stored at Sellafield for the next 50 years. At present, low level waste
is being disposed of in trenches at nearby Drigg, which has space into the
next century. Intermediate waste is a more immediate problem; BNFL has said
it will need to build a number of additional stores at Sellafield over the
next decade to house it.
Many countries are now investigating deep disposal of radioactive wastes;
some indeed have already created repositories, though not for the long-lived
intermediate waste which reprocessors like the UK and France must deal with.
Sweden was the first country to develop a deep underground nuclear waste
repository, at Forsmark, 50 metres under the Baltic seabed. Finland has just
opened its 100-metre deep repository at Olkiluoto and France is operating
two sites for disposal of low-level and short-lived intermediate waste, La
Manche, at Cap la Hague, and l'Aube, 200km south-east of Paris. Both are
near-surface, burial mound structures.
Considerable research is going on into possible underground disposal of high
level waste (HLW) and long-lived intermediate waste and a number of
countries, as well as carrying out research in existing mines, have
developed dedicated underground rock laboratories, or plan to do so.
The Swiss, who intend to have a 1,200-metre deep HLW repository ready by
2020, have even been carrying out underground experiments 1km inside an
Alpine mountain.
Although community response internationally to HLW disposal studies is not
uniform - two remote Swedish communities, attracted by job and planning gain
potential, have even volunteered their areas - the research has frequently
aroused fierce controversy. Examples include Nevada, where federal authority
proposals to construct a 500-metre deep underground rock laboratory (URL)
beneath Yucca Mountain, paving the way for an HLW repository, have met with
stiff opposition.
The search for a solution to the waste disposal problem has engendered
international co-operation, too. The EC has financed some research at
Belgium's URL at the Mol-Dessel nuclear site.
Operative since 1980, the URL is one of the world's first. Its object is to
demonstrate the site's technical feasibility and long-term safety.
Officially, it is called a High Activity Disposal Experimental Site - Hades
for short.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (2): Producers take a bad
mauling - Ken Gooding investigates fuel supplies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
URANIUM producers have been badly mauled by the present turmoil in the
nuclear industry. Mines recently closed down in Canada, the US, and some
countries in the former eastern bloc. Uranium prices in 1990 dropped to
Dollars 7.25 a lb, reckoned to be the lowest level ever seen, and even now
are still only about Dollars 8. Mining the material costs twice as much.
It has been worthwhile for some producers with long-term contracts at
reasonable prices to close mines and instead supply from the free market.
Prices peaked at Dollars 45 a lb in 1978 when it seemed oil prices were
going sky high and reflecting the fact that uranium has only one
application: for nuclear energy. Demand depends entirely on the nuclear
generating capacity in the 25 countries using that form of power.
The uranium market changed dramatically in the 1980s when brokers and other
intermediaries began to act for their own accounts. Over-optimistic
forecasts about future nuclear power demand contributed to the build-up of
nearly 80,000 tonnes of surplus uranium in stocks at power companies in
North America, western Europe and east Asia by that time. By selling from
these stocks, the brokers became an important new source of uranium supply.
More recently, brokers have also had access to the stockpiles in the
Commonwealth of Independent States, and this development is the main reason
the uranium price has, to coin a phrase, been bombed out. Nevertheless, the
industry continued to assume that stocks would not last for ever and would
be whittled away by the end of this decade. But now a new threat has
appeared - better relations between the world's superpowers means that
military stocks of uranium might be available to the over-supplied market.
Early estimates suggested 250,000 tonnes of natural uranium, or five years'
requirements, were available in the military stocks of China, France, India,
the UK and the US.
However, these estimates are wide of the mark, according to the Uranium
Institute, which draws together all sides of the industry. Estimates that
dismantling US and Russian nuclear weapons would provide 100,000 tonnes of
uranium were wrong, suggests the institute, and it is clear the two
superpowers will each release about 500 tonnes.
The two countries have initialled an agreement for the conversion of
highly-enriched uranium (HEU) from dismantled Russian nuclear weapons to
low-enriched uranium (LEU) for use as commercial nuclear fuel. The agreement
specifically mentions this 'will have no adverse impact on US consumers or
the mining and processing industries'.
The US and Russia have given themselves until next September to complete an
implementing contract which will provide for, among other things, the
conversion of at least 10 tonnes of highly-enriched uranium a year in the
first five years and 30 tonnes a year subsequently. Mr David Kay,
director-general of the Uranium Institute, says the US-Russian agreement
'ensures that not all the HEU will be entering the market at once but it
will be released over many years. This arrangement seems guaranteed to have
a zero impact on the market by ensuring that there is no vast new capacity.'
In 1991, producers supplied about 25,770 tonnes or only about 55 per cent of
the uranium requirements of the nuclear power industry outside the former
Communist bloc. The rest was supplied from stocks, from imports from the
CIS, other parts of eastern Europe, China, and by some recycled material.
This was bound to cause friction and the US uranium producers have filed an
anti-dumping petition against imports from the CIS which might lead to the
imposition of countervailing duties or 'voluntary' export restraints.
Mr Viktor Mikhailov, the Russian minister for nuclear energy, gave his
reaction in London last month. 'We believe efforts to limit or reduce our
exports are unfair and unfortunate,' he said. 'The world community must
realise the necessity of actively supporting the irreversible reforms in
Russia at this historic moment,' he added
He made an astonishing claim that Russia is exporting uranium at a profit.
Russia's present production allowed for the export of 3,500 tonnes of
uranium a year and an increase to 5,000 tonnes a year was possible. Mr
Mikhailov suggested some of Russia's 'substantial' uranium stockpile might
be moved to the west, partly to give assurance of supply to western
consumers and partly to be held as collateral for loans.
The Uranium Institute in its long-range projections assumes imports of about
6,000 tonnes a year from the CIS. It also assumes there will be a 15 per
cent increase of nuclear generating capacity worldwide from 1991 to 2000.
Most of the increase will be in France, Japan and Korea. Parallel to this
growth in capacity, it is expected that performance of reactors will improve
as well. So total worldwide uranium requirements for reactors are predicted
to increase by 17 per cent by 2000.
In that year, reactor requirements outside the former Communist bloc are
projected to be about 54,000 tonnes. If the CIS supplies about 6,000 tonnes
and 4,000 tonnes comes from reprocessing 9,000 tonnes of material, this
would leave about 44,000 tonnes to be covered by western producers - 18,000
tonnes more than 1991 production.
Therefore the Institute projects that most of the 75,000 tonnes of 'excess'
uranium stocks will be drawn down in a comparatively short space of time.
However, on present trends there should be no uranium shortages because, not
only could some western mining capacity be brought back into production if
demand required it, but also consumers have access to those stocks in the
CIS and China.
The present uranium glut has quite naturally raised questions about the
continuing need for the reprocessing of nuclear fuel. Twenty years ago
countries with nuclear power programmes believed that reprocessing would
help reduce the volume of radioactive wastes, and so ease disposal problems.
It would also release plutonium from the spent nuclear fuel. Plutonium was
considered an essential fuel for 'fast breeder' reactors and for nuclear
weapons.
But plutonium-fuelled fast reactors have proved expensive and prone to
technical mishap. Also most countries seem intent on dismantling nuclear
weapons rather than building new ones.
Many experts now suggest that storing spent fuel is cheaper than
reprocessing.

Review of the industry in Asia

<TEXT>
IN THE drive to win new orders for nuclear power equipment in Asia, it is
the old customers - Japan, South Korea and Taiwan - who will dominate the
order books into the next century.
The three are united on common problems: extensive reliance on imported
fossil fuels (coal, gas, oil); the need to ensure better security of energy
supply through nuclear power, and the requirement to pile on new power
output to fuel their already substantial industrial infrastructure.
Despite growing public opposition, each of the Far Eastern countries is
pushing nuclear power.
All have ambitious plans to increase substantially nuclear power's share of
the overall energy picture well into the next century.
Easily the biggest is Japan's, which now stands at 30,385 MW, or 26 per
cent, of installed capacity, spread out through 40 reactor units.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) has called for an
additional 40,000 MW to be added by 2010, of which 10,719 MW is now under
construction.
The environmental lobby, combined with the downturn in economic growth, has
caused delays in the pro-gramme.
Japanese energy authorities are also in talks with Russia for access to
Sakhalin Island gas and oil reserves.
If a deal is struck, then access to huge regional gas supplies could
substantially alter the long-range nuclear programme.
Nevertheless, near-term plans should benefit such western companies as
General Electric and Westinghouse, which control the licences for nuclear
technology. GE's Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) design is implemented through
Hitachi, and Toshiba, while Mitsubishi Heavy Industries uses Westinghouse's
Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR).
The recent big news comes from South Korea, which last month placed a
Dollars 950m order for two 700 MW Canadian Deuteurium Uranium (Candu)
reactors to be supplied by Atomic Energy of Canada (AECL) and other Canadian
and Korean companies.
Korea's installed nuclear capacity is 7,232 MW from nine units, with two
more under construction and 24 planned by early next century. At 40m people,
it is one third the size of Japan, but its nuclear capacity share is 49 per
cent, highest in the developing world.
Taiwan's Taipower, the state utility, recently decided to go ahead with its
long-delayed fourth reactor, a two-unit complex of 2,500 MW, which has been
subjected to violent Continued on next page
Ambitious schemesContinued from previous page
protest in recent years. It is now soliciting bids from western companies,
one of which is Britain's Nuclear Electric, which would design the reactor
as part of a consortium bid. Taiwan's capacity of 4,924 MW is supplied by
six units, and 38 per cent of all electricity comes from nuclear power.
A new player is China, which recently synchronised its largely in-house 300
MW reactor outside Shanghai. The cornerstone of its programme is the 2 x 950
MW complex nearing completion in Guangdong Province.
The first unit of the GEC- Alsthom-Electricite de France project is to go on
line next year with the second to follow a year later.
China is committed to adding five more units, at least two around Guangdong
and others elsewhere in the country.
The potential for orders in south-east Asia has improved. Indonesia expects
to put to tender orders for its first reactor later this decade, for
start-up by 2995-2007, to be part of a large complex initially located in
central Java.
Malaysia's Tenaga Nasional Berhad, the partly privatised state utility, may
have its first nuclear station in 10 years, according to H. Samy Vellu, the
energy minister, in a statement last month.
Thailand energy officials predict it will have its first nuclear plant, with
a capacity of 2,000 MW, operating by 2006 under the Electricity Generating
Authority (EGAT). The plan is expected to prompt intense national debate.
The Philippines, which has had a moth-balled 620 MW reactor, supplied by
Westinghouse, standing idle since 1986, is now finalising an agreement with
the US company to commission the reactor by 1995-96. The reactor was
suspended as a result of the post-Marcos anti- corruption clean-up by the
Corazon Aquino government.
India's outlook is grim. As a non-signatory to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT), its seven reactors have just 1,374 MW capacity. Western
technology is not available to it, and the collapse of the Soviet Union
means that a promised 2,000 MW complex in Tamil Nadu state is now cancelled.
Its long-range programme to add 10,000 MW of capacity has been scaled back
to 6,000 MW, and many believe that even this target is unachievable.
Pakistan, also a non-NPT nation, has an obsolescent 130 MW reactor in
Karachi. China is preparing to build a 300 MW reactor, and talks are under
way for a further 300 MW reactor.
However, the future of these plants is uncertain because of political
objections and lack of capital.

THE German Bundesbank yesterday said it expected exchange rates to settle
down after recent turmoil which led to an effective 6 per cent revaluation
of the D-Mark against other currencies in the European monetary system
(EMS).
However, it suggested there may have to be more adjustments in the run-up to
full monetary union (EMU), due by the end of the decade. Any remaining
exchange rate uncertainties could come to light after next January when the
Community formally establishes the single European market. In its October
monthly report, the bank reiterated its insistence that EC members should
use any opportunities to change parities within the exchange rate system up
to the final transition to monetary union.
Meanwhile, the recent effective revaluation of the D-Mark had brought its
value back into line with that achieved by the last formal realignment
within the EMS in 1987. This made it easier to control inflationary
tendencies in Germany, 'so that the quite considerable reductions in German
interest rates achieved so far are not endangered'.
Meanwhile, inflation was still well above 3 per cent, and the side-effects
of recent interventions in money markets had exacerbated the difficulties of
controlling money supply growth.

FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Major seeks summit talks on
currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major, the British prime minister, has confirmed in a letter to his
European Community partners that they should discuss recent monetary
developments, but without drawing any detailed conclusions for the moment.
To prevent any further turbulence in the markets, Mr Major's original idea
that the Birmingham summit on Friday should discuss reform of the Exchange
Rate Mechanism (ERM), has been dropped. 'This will not be a detailed
operational discussion, but I hope we can come to some procedural
conclusions,' the prime minister said in his letter.
British officials said in London that more detailed discussions on European
monetary problems, including possibly proposals for the ERM's reform, would
be held later by EC finance ministers. The finance ministers would not,
however, participate in the Birmingham summit.
Sir Nigel Wicks, a British Treasury official, has this week been visiting
the main EC capitals to prepare the monetary discussions.
Mr Major, who will be in the chair at the meeting, made clear in his letter
that he had also been forced to drop another of his proposals as the result
of opposition from some of his partners, that of holding a one-hour opening
session of the meeting in public.
Though favouring greater transparency of the Community's decision-making
process, the opponents of open sessions argue that they would merely result
in formal speech-making and give no insight into the detailed negotiating
process that usually goes on in ministerial councils.
However, ways of making the Community more open, together with subsidiarity
 -the principle that action should be taken at Community level only if it
cannot be taken more effectively by member states - and the closer
involvement of EC citizens in the Community's affairs, remain at the top of
the summit's agenda.
It is not yet certain whether Mr Major's wish to see the summit issue a
declaration on subsidiarity will be fulfilled. But even in the absence of
such a declaration, heads of government intend to lay down clear guidelines
on how ministers should proceed in defining and giving practical effect to
this principle. A formal document will then be prepared in time for the
Edinburgh summit in December.
The British presidency is also anxious that the summit should have a
thorough discussion of the Yugoslav problem.
British officials have pointed to the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees' warning that 2.8m people are directly affected by the crisis.
Insufficient relief supplies were getting through to Bosnia and there was a
serious danger of tens of thousands of people dying this winter. It was up
to the European Council (heads of government) to show that the Community and
its member states would take the necessary action to respond to humanitarian
needs.

FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Pohl criticises the priorities of EC
treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community governments have been too optimistic in aiming for
economic and monetary union by 1999 along the lines set out in the
Maastricht treaty, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank,
said last night.
Speaking at a reception at the Financial Times, Mr Pohl urged the EC to
forge ahead soon with the creation of a European central bank, but to
abandon such aspects as political union in the treaty for greater European
integration. These arrangements would make sense for a 'core group' of
European nations.
'I have come to the conclusion that if you want a European currency and a
European central bank you should not link that to too many other issues as
was laid out in the Maastricht treaty. I think that was a big mistake,' he
said. Instead, the tasks of a future European central bank should be limited
to setting interest rates and determining liquidity. The institution should
aim 'like the old gold standard' at the depoliticisation of money.
Mr Pohl - whose speech marked the launch of a book, The Bundesbank: the bank
that rules Europe, by David Marsh, European Editor of the Financial Times -
recalled that he had experienced antagonism from Bonn when raising interest
rates. But the Bundesbank's robust independence had conferred benefits on
Europe and Germany. 'The D-Mark has played a substantial role stabilising
the European Monetary System. It has led to lower inflation in Europe, not
only in Germany, and a narrowing of interest rate differentials until
recently.'
While a system of floating exchange rates would not be in Europe's
interests, he criticised the EMS as being 'half-baked'. Such fixed exchange
rate systems would always prompt attacks on participating currencies. Also
these systems would always be governed by the strongest currency, in this
case the D-Mark. This could be 'a problem by itself', he said.
It was 'interesting and amazing' that in spite of the turmoil of German
unification the D-Mark had remained the strongest currency in the exchange
rate mechanism. German unification, although now posing problems for Europe
because of high interest rates, had earlier created 'a demand-push' which
had led to more opportunities for exporters in other countries.
Mr Pohl said it would be logical for the 'core members', generally thought
to be Germany, France, the Benelux countries and possibly Denmark, to
proceed soon with their own monetary union.

<TEXT>
The franc has emerged 'intact and reinforced' from last month's monetary
crisis, Mr Jacques De Larosiere, the Banque of France governor, said
yesterday, writes David Buchan in Paris. Almost half of the FFr160bn (Pounds
18.7bn) spent in supporting the franc's parity against the D-Mark was
flowing back, as speculators gambling on the franc's devaluation had to buy
it back at an unchanged rate, he said.
The governor gave no details of last month's intervention, but it is
believed that half came from French reserves and the remainder from the
Bundesbank. He said Germans had done all they could to help the pound and
the lira.

FT  15 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Conflicting signals from the Danes -
Denmark's Maastricht sceptics seem to have hardened their line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN governments trying to analyse Denmark's efforts to overcome its
Maastricht predicament will need to show formidable mental agility. A set of
reflecting mirrors might come in handy too.
In coming weeks, the Danish government will be sending two sets of messages
 -one for external consumption, and one for an internal audience - to try to
resolve the imbroglio left by the Danish No to Maastricht in June.
Denmark faces two fundamental dilemmas.
First, to make the treaty palatable to a sceptical Danish electorate, the
minority conservative-liberal government of Mr Poul Schluter, the prime
minister, has to propose important changes.
Above all, it wants to block any obligatory Danish participation either in
Economic and Monetary Union (Emu) or in a common European defence.
Some of these changes would be difficult to swallow for other European
governments which want to keep the Maastricht treaty basically intact -
above all, in order to avoid a painful renegotiation process next year.
Second, no-one can be precisely sure why a small majority of Danes voted
against the treaty 4 1/2 months ago. According to one theory, if the
treaty's proponents had described Europe's future using the Danish word
'sammenslutning' ('binding together') instead of the foreign-sounding
'union', the people would have voted Yes. Another thesis is that Danish
voters misread the treaty's proposals on a 'social chapter' as inferring
that the country's generous social security entitlements would be cut.
Summing up the convoluted path Denmark must follow to come up with its
Maastricht proposals, Mr Henning Dyremose, the finance minister, says: 'It
has to be a different solution for us.
'But, for the others (in the EC), it must not be a different solution.'
Mr Dyremose is fully aware of the difficulties posed by the need to reach
simultaneous agreement both internally and with its EC partners.
'The challenge for us is the double decision-making process. We have to link
(the two processes) together at exactly the right point in time.'
Denmark already built into the original treaty last December a clause making
participation in Emu subject to a further referendum later in the 1990s.
The government now, however, seems likely to press for a much stronger form
of monetary 'opt out' clause, perhaps modelled on the exemption Britain
obtained at the Maastricht summit.
In fields like Emu, a majority of parties in the Folketing (parliament) is
now talking of changes to the treaty substantial enough to require some form
of renegotiation.
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, leader of the opposition Social Democratic Party
(SDP), says he is seeking changes affecting above all defence and monetary
union, as well as in the treaty's applicability to policies on citizenship
and immigration.
He also wants a stronger definition of the application of 'subsidiarity' -
making decisions at the lowest level of government.
'If the new basis (sought for the treaty) is only a gentleman's agreement,
then it will not be credible.
'A new model for Denmark will have to have binding consequences for other
countries too,' he said.
Mr Rasmussen points out that extension of 'subsidiarity', although necessary
in some fields, is by no means a panacea.
In environment policy, Denmark wants the Community to set tough minimum
standards which would be in force throughout the 12.
Views like this from Denmark's opposition parties will be crucial. All the
parties in the Folketing need to find a consensus on an amended treaty
before it can be resubmitted to the electorate, either next summer or,
possibly, in the autumn.
The SDP leadership campaigned in favour of the treaty before the June
referendum, but 60 per cent of party members voted against the document  -
making the next referendum a vital test of the party's credibility.
Emboldened by opposition elsewhere in the Community to the goal of European
union, Denmark's Maastricht sceptics seem to have hardened their line since
the summer.
One diplomat in Copenhagen says the Danes will want to build in a number of
additional safeguards - through extra protocols and clauses - in order to
'over-insure' against the risk that the treaty will again be rejected.
The left-wing Socialist People's Party (SPP), which campaigned against the
treaty this summer, is clearly in electoral competition to pick up
disenchanted SDP voters.
Mr Holger Nielsen, the SPP leader, could play a pivotal role in the new
prospective referendum campaign. He says he would like to vote Yes next time
round.
But, first, amendments will have to be decided which will imply some form of
renegotiation elsewhere in the EC. Mr Nielsen declares: 'It's important to
tell others that we want co-operation - but we don't want a European
federation.'

THE National Audit Office, the government's spending watchdog, is to
investigate the sale of the Property Services Agency's projects division to
Tarmac, Britain's largest construction and building materials company.
The investigation is to start within weeks of the completion of the deal at
the end of November.
The government agreed this month to pay Tarmac almost Pounds 50m to take
over responsibility for the division, one of the country's biggest
construction organisations, employing 1,800 people. About half those jobs
are now at risk.
The NAO investigation will be followed by an inquiry by the all-party
Commons public accounts committee.
The terms of the sale were challenged yesterday by Mr Jack Straw, shadow
environment secretary, who urged the European Commission to investigate it.
'This is one of the most bizarre privatisations ever. It represents a
triumph of arid dogma over the public interest and over the probity of
public finance,' he said.
Mr John Redwood, the local government minister, vigorously denied that there
was any impropriety in the deal.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Pits turn into bitter memory: Richard Donkin meets the
miners whose fate ends a working era
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THREE weeks when production stops at Bilsthorpe colliery in north
Nottinghamshire - perhaps a little later if he is kept to develop a linking
scheme with a neighbouring pit - Colin Black will leave more than memories
behind him.
At 21, he is one of the colliery's youngest recruits. But his whole life has
been shaped by the coal mining industry, and this pit in particular.
'My grandad was killed down Bilsthorpe pit 22 years ago,' he said. 'Another
grandad died of emphysema after working in the pit.' His father, uncle and
cousin all worked down the mine.
'I thought I had a long future here when I started just over two years ago,'
he said. 'They told me the colliery would have a life of 50 years.' He and
his wife Jane are expecting their first child in February. They have just
bought one of the former British Coal houses for Pounds 29,000.
'We took out a mortgage protection policy for the first two years, which
should help,' said Mrs Black. 'We're not sure yet what Colin will get in
redundancy payments but it might be around Pounds 5,000.'
She has worked out that with her wage at a hosiery factory and unemployment
benefit they should have an income of nearly Pounds 160 a week when Mr Black
stops work. 'He was earning Pounds 500 a week at the pit, so we are going to
see a big drop in standards. And where round here is he going to find work?'
Many of the younger miners were encouraged into the pits by their fathers.
They have mining in their blood. Mr Harold Sheppard, 52, is one of the
oldest among the 568 miners at Cotgrave pit near Nottingham who will work
their last shift tomorrow.
'I'll be all right,' he said. 'My house is paid for and I'll have my
redundancy pay, but it's the young ones I feel for. The average age of the
men at our pit is 32. I brought my son in there. He is 24, married with a
child on the way and he's bought a house. What is he going to do?'
Only the suddenness of Cotgrave's closure came as a surprise. The pit had
geological difficulties and the miners knew that its days were numbered, but
previously the closure programme has allowed transfers to other mines. This
time transfers are not in the deal.
The relocation programmes have led to a broad mix of regional backgrounds
across the coalfields. In north Nottinghamshire, men from Durham, western
Scotland and south Wales work beside with second-generation Latvians and
Estonians.
Mr Jim Campbell came down to Clipstone with his father Hamish from Girvan,
Ayrshire, in 1978. He and his brother followed their father into the pit.
'We thought we were set up here, but look at us now,' he said. 'It doesn't
matter what union you're in now. It's finished for everybody.'
Recriminations, sadness and a few old scores have begun to emerge among the
miners' welfare clubs across the Nottinghamshire coalfield as the full
implications of the cuts become apparent. Divided loyalties between members
of the National Union of Mineworkers and the breakaway Union of Democratic
Mineworkers have resurfaced, although not with the bitterness that broke up
whole families in the 1984-85 strike. At Bilsthorpe Miners' Welfare, men
drink side by side with those they picketed eight years ago.
The NUM men are determined to salvage some pride from their defeat in the
year-long dispute. Brandishing a tattoo on his forearm that recounted his
battle honours in previous strikes, Mr Ronnie Green, a former miner, said:
'A lot of people here sold their souls, but by God they wish they hadn't
now.' But there was no gloating. 'My heart goes out to these people here,'
he said, 'but I saw it coming. These lads have been sold down the river more
than I have been.'
In the confused aftermath of the announcements, miners who have been
enjoying the best wages of their careers cannot come to terms with the loss
of their jobs. Some have notched up earnings of Pounds 21,000 in less than
six months and could have expected to have earned Pounds 50,000 this year.
Mr David Bates, the 33-year-old NUM branch secretary at Bilsthorpe, said the
hardest part about the closure was that it came at a time of high
productivity. 'We have turned production on its head but the trouble is we
have done too much. We have the largest recoverable reserves in this area.
There is a mile of coal down there worth Pounds 33m and ready to mine. Now
we have to break through to the Thoresby colliery workings so they can mine
our coal.'
Mr Paul Sterland, a member of Nacods, the supervisors' union, was numbed at
the news. 'I have worked in the mine 17 years, I'm married with three young
kids, aged three, six and nine, and I have no future. I'm 33 and my life is
finished.'
He forecast the end of communities like Bilsthorpe. 'It had a special
feeling here. Everyone has always helped each other but they won't be able
to do that now. In another four or five years it will be like a ghost town.'
Mr Alan Stoneman, another NUM man who joined the 1984 strike, compared the
government's coal policy with that of its support for nuclear power, which
has included subsidies levied from other energy producers.
Mining colleagues at the club studied their beer glasses when he claimed the
NUM had been right about the threat to the coalfields eight years ago. 'The
time has come for you to admit it,' he said to them. Mr David Smith, a UDM
man, looked him in the eyes, and said: 'You were right and I was wrong.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Doubt over rail freight sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, LISA WOOD and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MILLIONS OF tonnes of coal traffic will be lost as a result of the pit
closure programme, worsening the outlook for the planned sale of BR's
freight businesses as part of the privatisation process next year. Several
thousand jobs in British Rail's coal train business are also likely to go.
The closures are a particularly severe blow for BR because Trainload Coal,
its coal-carrying business, is virtually the only profitable part of the
railway.
Trainload Coal's business consists almost entirely of carrying coal from
pits to power stations. Last year it carried 75m tonnes, but British Coal
says power stations are expected to take only 40m tonnes next year.
BR will not say how many are employed by Trainload Coal, but the figure is
believed to be 7,000. Up to half seem likely to lose their jobs.
The downturn in business will jeopardise other parts of the railway because
operations that share tracks, engine sheds or other facilities with
Trainload Coal may not be viable if required to support the full costs of
those assets alone.
Operations likely to be affected include other parts of the Trainload
Freight business - Trainload Construction, Trainload Petroleum and Trainload
Metals. Trainload Freight reported turnover of Pounds 505.3m last year, of
which Trainload Coal is believed to have contributed Pounds 300m.
Mr Derrick Fullick, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef,
said he feared that 11 engine sheds would be affected and that eight of them
would have to close. Those most likely to be affected are the Stoke and
Sunderland depots.
Mr Frank Dobson, shadow employment secretary, claimed yesterday that up to
50,000 jobs in areas related to mining would be lost.
Mr Andrew Glyn, an economist at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, estimated
that a total of 78,600 jobs would disappear.
Mr Dobson named 65 engineering and component supplier companies that might
be affected. He said jobs in companies supplying the mining industry in
towns as far away as Bracknell and Basingstoke were threatened.
Labour said jobs were at stake among private contractors working in
maintenance. Nacods, the supervisors union, says 15,000 contractors are
employed by British Coal. BC said it could not confirm that because it
employed companies, not individuals.

SIR NICHOLAS GOODISON, chairman of the TSB bank and of the British Bankers
Association, will today urge the government to give independent control of
monetary policy to the Bank of England, Robert Peston writes.
In a speech at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels, Sir
Nicholas will urge 'the creation of an independent monetary authority', free
of political interference, to safeguard the currency.
He will say there should have been a realignment of currencies within the
European exchange rate mechanism before the UK was forced to suspend
membership.
'The fault was to believe the ERM had already become a fixed rate system',
he will say. 'The ERM bands were never intended to cope with the strains of
German reunification coinciding with a worldwide recession. It was foolish
to expect them to do so. The members of the mechanism should have agreed to
a general realignment earlier.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Call for reform of intangibles reporting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES should include both purchased and internally created intangible
assets on their balance sheets, according to a study sponsored by the
Accounting Standards Board and the research board of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants in England and Wales.
Intangible assets are non-physical assets such as brand names which a
growing number of companies are showing in their accounts with little
guidance on their treatment.
The Manchester University study will intensify the debate over whether
intangibles should be recognised. It says intangibles should be included
provided the existence and amount can be justified. It also wants greater
disclosure of the nature of valuations.

High-powered ideas - Motorola's Iridium system will span the globe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MORANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMUNICATION satellites do not respect national boundaries. Consequently,
they have a vital part to play in international communi-cations. However,
while those in use orbit the globe at a height of 22,000 miles, Motorola and
a number of the other leading telecommunications companies such as Alcatel
and TRW have proposed networks of satellites in low earth orbit (Leo) that
would enable subscribers to use small hand-held telephones when even in the
remotest parts of the globe. This technology will complement existing
terrestrial cellular and wired systems and could meet the need of remote
areas where it is too expensive to provide communications. However, even in
the long term it will not be a low-cost option. Because the cost will run
into billions of dollars, a limited, experimental system will be launched
initially. In the longer term, the potential market is huge. Motorola, which
is taking this market very seriously, hopes to find 2m customers by 2002.
While most will be voice, Motorola expects that this figure will include
about 700,000 paging users. In addition, there will be users who transmit
data but, as this will be over a normal voice channel to or from a laptop PC
it will be impossible to quantify these numbers. In the US, Motorola
Satellite Communications Inc has been awarded an experimental licence to
construct and launch five satellites to demonstrate the feasibility of its
Iridium system. The name Iridium was chosen for Motorola's global, digital,
wireless communi-cations network because the original concept required 77
satellites to span the globe - and 77 is the atomic number of the element
Iridium. The Iridium system intends to offer high-quality, global voice,
paging, facsimile, data and radio determination satellite services to its
subscribers.
The Iridium telephone will be a dual-mode portable instrument designed to
work in conjunction with existing cellular systems. This function will
provide flexibility for the travelling subscriber by allowing the user to
choose among network alternatives according to cost and availa-bility. The
phone will be designed with a data connec-tion for transmitting fax and
computer files. Furthermore, the dual-mode approach will enable Iridium to
enter partnership agreements with the existing cellular networks, avoid
head-on competition, and sidestep much of the large outlay of setting up its
own sales infrastructure.
By the time Iridium is in place, the GSM pan-European digital cellular
network will have rolled out to encompass a good proportion of Europe and
will also have been adopted in other parts of the globe.
Hence, a businessman who feels that his work may take him out of the reach
of GSM, could well consider that Iridium is of significant benefit.
Iridium satellites will be small, lightweight, and interconnected to provide
continuous line-of-sight coverage between all points on the globe and within
an altitude of 100 miles. Each satellite will project cell patterns on to
the earth's surface, and the constellation of satellites will provide global
coverage.
The 77 satellites called for in the original concept have been reduced to 66
by further development of the concept. As well as reducing overall costs it
should allow system capacity to be re-allocated to respond to regional
market demand so as to concentrate channels over densely populated regions.
In operation, the telephone, having checked that it cannot get a channel on
the local terrestrial network on which it is registered, will interface with
the satellites overhead and, in turn, with the public switched telephone
network via terrestrial gateways.
These gateways will store customer billing information, keep track of user
locations, and interconnect with the terrestrial carriers.
Service will be available on a country-by-country switched basis as
negotiated with individual governments, telecommunications author-ties and
service providers. One of the critical issues will be the attitudes of the
various national authorities.
Countries may see Iridium as a threat in that it could cream off revenue
from network to remote areas which are inher-ently expensive to service,
frequently inadequate, and generally unprofitable because of the cost of
having to install vast amounts of cabling to support just a few subscribers
who probably make little use of phones anyway.
Where these countries take a fresh look, they will see that Iridium will be
able to provide the infrastructure to meet the communications needs of their
remote communities cost-effectively, by taking advantage of the economy of
scale that results by serving users from the developed countries.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (12): Expanded
service links - Freephone numbers cut company overheads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW CAN a company expand into another country without the expense of setting
up an office there? The answer, according to the world's telephone
companies, is to set up an international Freephone number. Potential
customers in the target country can call up free of charge to ask for the
brochure or discuss services. And the company, hopefully, will win new
clients.
Freephone numbers, otherwise known as toll-free numbers in the US, or green
numbers in continental Europe, are fast becoming a competitive area for
international telephone companies. The reason is that international
businesses are organising themselves on a regional basis, rather than on a
national basis. So, instead of having service offices in the UK, France,
Germany, Holland and Switzerland they might choose to have only one European
centre.
For example, American personal computer manufacturer Packard Bell, set up a
customer support centre in the Netherlands. Calls from customers in 13
countries are transmitted toll-free to the centre, where inquiries are dealt
with by 60 multilingual staff.
Similarly, the hotel chain Holiday Inn is about to set up a Dutch-based
reservation centre to take bookings for hotels all around Europe. Customers
who want to book, do not have to worry about the expense of making an
international call, and the company has the benifit of reducing its
overheads.
Other users include mail order suppliers and distribution companies which
give the freephone number to their drivers to call home.
Call revenue from international Freephone numbers can be significant, and
some telephone companies are going out of their way to attract the business.
PTT Telecom Netherlands offers special tariff packages, voice mail, and
ready-furnished offices fitted with telemarketing equipment. It wants to
attract call traffic to Holland, and claims that its low call charges are a
competitive weapon.
BT encourages customers by offering discounts according to the volume of
traffic generated by the Freephone number. It is also putting in more
functions on the exchanges which handle the freephone calls: for example, it
can transfer the calls to different locations if given specific times of the
day, or days of the week, to do it.
Roger Gilbert, manager of BT's freephone services, said that international
freephone numbers are growing in double digits.
But the phone companies are also starting to use freephone numbers in
developing new services for travellers. The most significant of these is
what is referred to as third country calling. This is where a customer can
dial toll-free from one country to another, and be put through to a third
one. They get the bill at their home address.
The service is similar to the call-home services such as BT Direct, except
that BT Direct only allows people to call back to the UK. With third country
calling, someone could call from Stockholm to London toll-free, and be
connected to Germany.
American phone company Sprint International, is beginning to market such a
service. Subscribers get a charge card showing an account number, as well as
a PIN number. Sprint first offered the service to its existing charge card
holders when it launched on September 1. It claims that in the first week,
between 5 and 10 per cent of all calls were third country calls.
But Sprint is not limiting its marketing of the service to the US. A
marketing promotion campaign running with British Airways, aims to sell to
business travellers of all nationalities. All subscribers, even those based
outside the US, will be put through to a Sprint operator in the US who will
connect the call.
A number of other phone companies, including BT, are expected to announce
third country calling soon.
Several are also working in partnership with credit card company Visa
International to introduce a toll-free calling facility for Visa card
holders. Called Visaphone, it means that people can make calls by dialling a
freephone number and quoting their Visa account number and a special PIN to
the operator. They pay Visa for the call, which appears itemised on their
monthly bill.
Like the Sprint service, Visaphone will be targeted at international
travellers. It is likely to be popular with people who spend a lot of time
in hotels, because it avoids the huge surcharges that hotels add to guests'
phone bills. In one week last August, Visaphone generated 7,000 phone calls
in the US.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (13): In with the
'IN' crowd - Intelligent networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY or more years after their introduction, it is estimated that
freephone and other types of so-called 'intelligent network' (IN) calls
generate around 18 per cent of total telecommunications income in the US.
The market research company, Frost &amp; Sullivan puts US service revenues for
these calls at Dollars 19.6bn in 1991, and forecasts a business worth
Dollars 34.5bn in 1997.
In Europe and Asia, where telephone companies were traditionally less
consumer-oriented and the mass telephone habit has been slower to develop,
freephone and other IN services were previously neglected.
Not so today. With competition to the incumbent operators on the increase,
the revenue-earning possibilities of new products such as IN services are
attracting the close attention of many PTTs.
Interest is not confined to the former monopoly operators. In mid-June, for
example, the UK's second carrier Mercury Communications launched its own
freephone and low tariff services.
The company believes that these types of call are currently worth around
Dollars 300m in the UK, and that the figure will double in the next five
years as organisations use the services to help maintain established
customer bases and attract new businesses.
'Common areas of usage for this service so far include banks, insurance
companies, building societies, hotels, airlines and telemarketers,' says
Richard Dorgan, freephone product manager at Mercury.
'We anticipate that in time it will be considered unusual for a customer to
pay for an enquiry call in nearly all sectors of business.'
Freephone is the highly visible tip of the IN iceberg. In essence an IN
involves the addition of computer intelligence to the conventional telephone
network to allow a number of permutations on the traditional function of
connecting one wireline subscriber to another by the most direct route, and
charging the call originator for the privilege.
As well as reversing normal charging procedures and adding alternative
delivery options based on time and location criteria, computer intelligence
facilitates the introduction of a whole range of new services.
Included are offerings such as virtual private networks, in which unused
public network capacity is partitioned off for private company use, credit
card calling, calls to personal numbers regardless of an individual's
physical location in the network or in the world, the display of in-coming
caller numbers, automatic re-routing of calls around a network to
accommodate traffic surges following televised appeals or disasters, and
pay-per-use telephone information services which encompass anything from
weather reports to so-called 'sex lines'.
Cellular telephony is itself a species of IN service. Initial IN offerings,
such as freephone, were built to be accessed nationwide but, to reduce
operator costs, used a small number of large centralised data bases which
were interrogated over a special transmission network as the need arose.
Future implementations are likely to be more specialised, both in terms of
content and geographic availability. Derek Hadden, Mercury's IN Product
Manager, believes that one future possibility is for local IN services to be
tailored to the needs of one or more large corporate customers, providing
switchboard, automatic call distribution and database retrieval functions
from within the public network, with the ability to vary operating
parameters on a day-to-day basis.
At the same time, though, Mr Hadden envisages the extension of IN services
on the international front. This could take various forms, including cross
border freephone, 'follow-me' telephone calls around the globe, and the
selling of IN access from one country to another.
'You could provide a service to other carriers who don't want to spend money
on developing their own IN infrastructure' suggests Mr Hadden.
Frost &amp; Sullivan says 'everyone loves INs.' Corporate customers of such
services are certainly keen and the reasons are not difficult to discover.
In a recent Gallup Poll carried out for Mercury, it emerged that 91 per cent
of the adult population in the UK was familiar with freephone services and
that the presence of a freephone number in company literature would
influence 38 per cent of the adult population to respond to that company
rather than another.
For telecommunications operators, the big 'plus' is that INs represent a
relatively low cost method of getting a much better return on existing
investments.
'By introducing intelligent networks you can aim to get more traffic over
the same infrastructure, and you can start to charge premiums on these
services,' observes Robert Harrison, principal consultant with the PA
Consulting Group.
'The capital spend on equipment is far lower than the operators have already
had to make to digitise the network.'
As well as generating additional revenue, IN services can be implemented
rapidly and provide better tools for the overall management and control of
networks and services.
IN equipment suppliers, including Alcatel, AT&amp;T Network Systems
International, Ericsson, Fujitsu, GPT, Nokia, Northern Telecom and Siemens,
see the technology as both a parallel commercial opportunity to their
established exchange products and as a possible way to break into new
national and regional markets.
Mr Harrison of PA Consulting values the European IN equipment market in 1992
at Dollars 71m, rising to nearly Dollars 408m by 1997.
However, IN technology presents problems as well as commercial opportunities
for service operators and manufacturers alike. Some types of IN service
require that the operators transfer some degree of network control to their
customers.
How this will be managed, and to what extent it will be permitted, are two
of the unknowns of the future IN landscape.
'I don't think that anywhere in the world yet there's been enough experience
of operating with a significant amount of user control,' notes Tony Cobbe,
group director of GPT's Telecommunications Systems Group.
'We don't know whether there are, or are not, any network risks which arise
from that.'
INs also slice across traditional PTT management and operational structures,
and adapting to their implementation may not be painless. For telephone
exchange suppliers, the IN opportunity is distinctly double-edged.
While new business may be generated, INs are to a large extent
switch-independent, making it possible for PTTs to ignore established
supplier arrangements. Also, since network management and data processing
are crucial parts of the IN technology mix, suppliers such as DEC, IBM,
Stratus and Tandem from outside the mainstream public exchange field are
muscling into the act.
Some observers envisage the computer industry in the longer term making off
with the spoils of the market. Harrison acknowledges that the computer
industry will become more active in the sector, but forecasts a marriage of
necessity between the two industries - 'they both have relevant strengths. I
think they actually need each other - whether they necessarily all realise
that, is another matter.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian, Chinese export hopes
buoy US wheat
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHICAGO WHEAT markets have responded positively this week to announcements
that are likely to result in large quantities of US grain being shipped to
Russia and China.
Wheat futures for December delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade have risen
16 cents a bushel since the US Department of Agriculture last Friday awarded
Dollars 525m in export credits and food aid to Russia. The former Soviet
republic rushed to consume the credits, bidding on Tuesday for 750,000
tonnes of US maize and 190,000 tonnes of soyameal.
Yesterday morning talk that Russia had placed a bid for 1.6m tonnes of soft
red winter wheat, the variety traded in Chicago, boosted futures. The bid
was made under the US Export Enhancement Program at a price of Dollars
119.90 a tonne.
Analysts said that was on the low side and added that the USDA, which
administers the EEP, might reject it and seek a price closer to Dollars 124.
Russia would like the wheat shipped within the next 60 days.
Russia received a total of Dollars 190m in wheat credits in the package
announced last week.
The US also came to an agreement on Friday with China for more open trade
between the two countries. China, usually the US's second-largest wheat
customer, has stonewalled US traders this year, protesting at the Bush
administration's tough position on trade rules, and more recently, the
president's campaign promise to sell F-16 fighter jets to China's rival,
Taiwan.
The new trade accord has revived rumours that China will make a big wheat
purchase before the US presidential election on November 3, where Mr Bush
badly needs the farm vote to retain his office.
'Bush and China are very close. Bush used to be Ambassador to China,' said
Mr Daniel Basse, director of research for Chicago-based AgResource Company.
'It would make sense for them (the Chinese) to come in and support him.'
China bought 3.8m tonnes of US wheat in 1991, and having bought nothing so
far in 1992, could come in with a pre-election bid for as much as 1m tonnes,
traders say. China has US EEP allocations for no less than 7m tonnes, which
even the most optimistic Washington bureaucrat does not expect them to
consume.
Money, more than politics, may prompt a Chinese wheat purchase soon. The
Chinese have a reputation for being among the world's shrewdest wheat
traders.
Their absence from US markets allowed world wheat prices to sink through the
summer. However, with the entry of Russia and other EEP buyers into the
markets in recent weeks, US wheat prices have begun to rise. A longer wait
might causes China to miss the year's optimum prices.
Wheat for December delivery closed at Dollars 3.41 1/2 a bushel in the
Chicago futures market Friday, and traded as high as Dollars 3.56 a bushel
early yesterday. That is the highest level the contract has seen since the
beginning of the US wheat harvest in June.

to India

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUSTRALIAN Wheat Board yesterday announced its second ADollars 100m
(Pounds 42m) sale to India in two months, suggesting that demand for
Australian wheat remains strong in spite of competition from subsidised US
and European Community exports.
The announcement brings sales to India to 1m tonnes this year, and will
raise hopes of spin-off benefits for Australian grain legume growers, who
could benefit from sharing transport costs.
The sales mark the resumption of large-scale Australian wheat exports to
India after a gap of 10 years, in spite of competition from subsidised
exports, which Canberra claims have corrupted world markets. The US recently
announced the sale of 1m tonnes of subsidised wheat to India under its
revised Export Enhancement Program, announced by President Bush earlier in
the US presidential election campaign.
India has bought 3m tonnes of wheat this year from Australia, the US and
Canada following a disappointing harvest. New Delhi has been a small net
exporter of wheat in recent years.
The US is believed to have allocated a further 500,000 tonnes of subsidised
wheat for sale to India, but Australian officials said it was unclear
whether the offer would be taken up. 'I would expect that the Indian
authorities will now wait to gauge the size of their domestic crop before
committing themselves to further imports,' said Mr Ron Storey, AWB marketing
manager.
Australia has been strongly critical of the impact of EEP sales on its
markets, although the federal government has accepted US arguments that the
programme is aimed primarily at competing with EC subsidies.

<TEXT>
BRAZIL EXPORTED 1m bags (60.5 kg each) of coffee in September, down from
1.6m for the same month last year, according to figures announced by the
Brazilian Federation of Coffee Exporters. A slight increase in the average
price for the month, to Dollars 48.80 a bag, failed to help receipts
significantly. The still depressed world prices limited income to Dollars
51m for September, less than half that for the same month last year, and
significantly below the Dollars 64.3m registered in August.
For the first nine months of the year, exports are down just 3.8 per cent in
volume from the same period last year, at 12.7m bags. Receipts, however, are
down 26.5 per cent for the period, at Dollars 751.7m.
Meanwhile, domestic prices have rebounded by about 67 per cent over the past
30 days. An average bag of export quality coffee is now selling for about
Dollars 60.
Mr Luiz Sergio de Paiva Pereira, director of the coffee division of the
Pocos de Caldas Regional Co-operative in Minas Gerais state said there were
several reasons for the partial recovery, including 'satisfactory' results
of London talks on the International Coffee Agreement and slightly smaller
stocks in consumer countries, together with confirmed low production
(18m-20m bags) for this harvest in Brazil and expectations of continued
sluggishness next season. There had been additional pressure from some
exporters who were scrambling to meet contracts for which they lacked
sufficient stocks.
The recent government decision to roll over producer loans also helped. 'If
it hadn't been for the roll-over, producers would be worried about selling
at any price just to meet their obligations,' he said. 'Now, with lower
output expected for the next harvest, it makes sense to manage stocks.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia's embarrassment of
riches - Passions aroused by an ancient silver mine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS FREISINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ANCIENT Bolivian silver mine, thought to have been exhausted 200 years
ago, may still hold the largest reserve of silver in the world.
Frustratingly for the poorest country in South America, the exploitation of
this resource is highly problematic and the discovery has disturbed more
people than it has excited.
The Cerro Rico or 'Rich Hill', a rust-coloured mountain that towers over the
town of Potosi, was the legendary peak of solid silver that financed the
Spanish Empire at the cost of the lives of countless indigenous people who
died in forced labour there.
First exploited in the 16th century, the prodigious quantity of silver it
produced stimulated a worldwide inflation and, according to some historians,
thus led to capitalism itself. At its zenith, Potosi was the size of
contemporary Paris, in spite of its remote location in the bleakest part of
the Andean altiplano.
By the 18th century the Spanish believed the mine was exhausted. Tin gave a
new lease of life to the hill in the late 19th century until the tin crash
in 1985 when large scale mining there came to an end.
Recently, studies by private companies and by the United Nations have
suggested that, far from being exhausted, there may be more silver still in
the mine than was ever taken out, disseminated in half a billion tonnes of
low-grade ore. The average silver concentration, 120 grams per tonne, is
only marginal at today's world price, but there are known zones of much
higher concentration, and other metals such as tin and zinc could be
extracted simultaneously. According to experts, exploitation could be
profitable even at current depressed metal prices using open-cast mining
combined with modern methods of heap leaching.
However, the people of Potosi and many others have vowed to resist this
development tooth and nail. The principal problem is the proposed method of
extraction. The mountain is not just a local, but a national symbol,
imprinted on the Bolivian flag, and the town is a masterpiece of colonial
architecture; both have been declared conservation sites by Unesco.
Open-cast mining would not only destroy the symbol but also make the town
uninhabitable by exposing it to the bitter climate of the surrounding
plateau, from which the mountain currently acts as a shield.
Moreover, though large-scale mining has ceased, there are over 10,000
'co-operativistas' still at work mining silver, individuals who scratch out
a subsistence income using techniques 100 years out of date. Only a handful
of these would be employed in an open-pit mine. Despite working in
unspeakable conditions that give them life expectancies of about 35 years,
they resent the potential threat to their livelihood, because they say there
are simply no alternatives. One of them, Mr Florencio Quispe, says, 'the
Cerro is like our mother and father. It feeds our families, and we would
fight to defend it'. Because these co-operativistas' have secured partial
exploitation rights to the mountain, potential investors could face a legal
nightmare.
The large scale investment required, estimated to be as high as Dollars
800m, is well beyond the capacity of local investors. But, despite a
government eager to attract foreign investment, many Bolivian people are
mindful of past exploitation and the feelings are nowhere more acute than in
Potosi.
Mr Carlos Vasquez, a local mining engineer, says that he would rather see
the wealth stay in the ground than let foreigners 'yet again take the riches
of our mountain, leaving nothing for Bolivia'.
Aware of the political sensitivities, the Bolivian government is publicly
coy about the future of the Cerro. But Mr Jaime Villalobos, a former
minister of mines, says that Bolivia cannot afford not to develop such
resources, and that with appropriate taxation, the people would benefit. 'In
country that has one of the highest child mortalities in the western
hemisphere, it would be criminal to neglect this opportunity.'
According to Mr Villalobos, various US and Canadian corporations have
quietly expressed interest in exploiting the mountain, were attitudes to
change. The lure of the Cerro Rico is as strong as ever. Despite all the
problems, few doubt that Bolivia will eventually succumb to the temptation
of its treasures.

closed near the day's lows on mainly technical dealing with little sign of
any aggressive origin selling. The next downside objective for March is a
test of support at Pounds 650 a tonne, dealers said. Robusta COFFEE futures
ran into an expected bout of profit taking after January earlier rose to a
six-month high of Dollars 868 a tonne, but the overall mood remained
constructive. But dealers said there might be scope for a more extensive
correction as the market has risen around Dollars 90 since the end of last
month.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Alberta tries to boost oil
drilling activity
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ALBERTA government has come to the aid of western Canada's struggling
energy industry by substantially cutting royalties levied on oil and gas
producers and by simplifying the 20-year old tax system.
The cuts, which will cost the provincial treasury about CDollars 488m
(Pounds 225m) over the next three years, are designed to stimulate drilling
activity, which has slumped from 12,000 wells a year in the mid-80s to 4,000
last year.
Furthermore, a restructuring of the tax system will provide for lower
royalties as oil and gas prices decline. The present regime was put in place
in the early 1970s when hopes were high that prices would keep on rising.
Mr Art Hibbard, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling
Contractors, said yesterday that, based on the amounts of money involved,
the industry may drill another 500 to 600 wells this year as a result of the
concessions.
Mr Hibbard said the concessions 'are not a saviour or panacea for all our
ills, but we believe the government went as far as it could'.
The energy industry is also hoping that the sharp increase in North American
natural gas prices this year and hopes that the oil price will remain at
about USDollars 21-Dollars 22 a barrel will attract new investment in coming
months.
Under the new system, the base rate for royalties will be cut by as much as
13 percentage points. For new discoveries, the rate will drop to 10 per cent
from almost 22 per cent. A one-year royalty holiday for oil wells will
become permanent.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Shorter yields in Germany stage sharp rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-Mark yield curve began to swing back yesterday after the recent strong
advance in shorter-dated German government bonds, confirming that hopes of a
rate cut at today's Bundesbank council meeting have dimmed.
Yields on five and ten-year bonds had been virtually identical before
yesterday, following the heavy buying of shorter-maturity paper on rate cut
hopes. Yesterday, though, the yield curve retreated to its familiar inverted
shape of recent times as shorter yields rose sharply.
The correction was seen in the Euro-Mark contract on Liffe, where the
December contract fell from an opening of 91.77 to 91.63 by the close.
Longer-dated bonds also fell in reaction, though not as far.
Also yesterday, the German constitutional court issued its expected ruling
that tax allowances for lower paid workers should be raised. 'This is in
line with what the bond market had feared - but it fell well short of the
market's worst fears of the fiscal consequences,' said Mr Klaus Baader, an
economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London.
CANADIAN government bonds fell by more than a point during morning trading
on news of the Standard &amp; Poor's downgrade. The timing of the announcement
also brought fears for the outcome of a planned CDollars 1.2bn domestic
10-year note auction, due to take place yesterday. The yield on the paper,
at around 7.65 the previous night, jumped to around 8 per cent early in the
day.
The S&amp;P downgrade is expected to have a significant effect on the Canadian
government bond market, with Japanese investors the single largest holders
of Canadian debt outside Canada.
LONGER-dated UK gilts lost ground while shorter-maturity paper moved ahead
yesterday, leaving the yield curve considerably steeper on the day.
The move away from longer-dated bonds reversed some of the previous day's
gains, suggesting that investors remain concerned about the outlook for
inflation and at the same time optimistic about a cut in the UK base rate.
The long gilt futures contract on Liffe closed at 97 1/16 , down from its
opening of 97 11/32 .
LONGER-dated US Treasuries rose yesterday following some
weaker-than-expected economic statistics and car sales figures.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  11/32 at 96
13/32 , yielding 7.499 per cent. The two-year note was slightly lower, down
 1/32 at 99 31/32 , to yield 3.999 per cent.
Prices showed little reaction in early trading on news of a 0.3 per cent
increase in September retail sales. Analysts had been looking for a 0.5 per
cent rise. August retail sales, however, were revised from an originally
estimated 0.5 per cent decline to an unchanged position, a move that offset
the benefits to bond prices of the bad September figure.
After holding steady for half the day, prices at the long end started moving
higher during the afternoon on a combination of news of weak sales at
General Motors and technical buying linked to the futures market.

FT  15 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Canadian issues hit by debt downgrading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES in Eurobonds issued by Canada and Canadian provinces fell sharply
yesterday, when the Government of Canada lost its AAA foreign debt rating
from Standard &amp; Poor's.
Eurobonds issued by the Canadian provinces were among the worst casualties,
even though they were not downgraded. The yield spread of Province of
Ontario's 10-year dollar global bond issue widened from 70 basis points to
75 basis points above the comparable Canadian government bond, traders said.
Only foreign debt issued by Canada and by sovereign-guaranteed agencies like
the Export Development Corporation and the Federal Business Development Bank
is affected by the downgrade, but the news reawakened worries about the
creditworthiness of the Canadian provinces, heavy borrowers in the Eurobond
market. The outlook for the ratings of Alberta, New Brunswick, Ontario and
Quebec is described as negative by S&amp;P.
Canada, once an active issuer in the Eurobond market, has not tapped the
sector since 1986, so its outstanding issues are no longer actively traded.
In addition, the news of the downgrade reawakened worries about the economic
problems facing other sovereign issuers, particularly Scandinavian borrowers
and Italy, whose paper could come under further selling pressure.
Eurobond spreads in Canadian provinces ballooned last month, on worries
about the outcome of the October 26 national referendum on the
constitutional framework governing federal/provincial relations in Canada.
But the wider spreads had attracted asset swappers, able to switch
fixed-rate bonds into floating-rate assets. Now, renewed concerns about
creditworthiness could halt this process.
Several borrowers, such as Metropolis of Tokyo and Kansai Electric Power
Company, which had been eyeing the Canadian dollar sector of the Eurobond
market could switch to the dollar market as a result of Canadian market
turmoil.
Moody's said it may downgrade the long-term debt ratings for Barclays Bank
and National Westminster Bank.

OASYS Global, one of the three electronic trade confirmation systems
selected by the International User Group last February, was launched
yesterday after four weeks of client testing, writes Tracy Corrigan.
By the end of this week, about 20 clients will be linked up, according to Mr
Robert Hayim, general manager of Thomson Financial Services, the system's
developer. Thomson expects a ratio among clients of 30 per cent
institutional investors to 70 per cent brokers.
Electronic confirmation of the details of trades replaces the current system
based on telex and facsimile. The development of the three systems was
instigated by the International User Group, a group of institutional
investors and stockbrokers who want the systems to become standard products
in the securities industry.
The London Stock Exchange's Sequal is on target for delivery at end of
October, according to an official. Trax, the International Securities Market
Association's product, will start testing with selected clients at the end
of the month, and is due to go live in December.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (15): Japan leads
the way - The fax phenomenon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE worldwide installed base of facsimile machines fast approaching 30m
units and the volume of facsimile transmissions doubling every three years,
the market might appear to have reached saturation point.
Far from it. The number of new technologies, services and products being
announced almost daily only gives a hint of what the future holds for fax as
the simplest of all technologies for transmitting exact copies of original
documents.
According to the market research organisation, BIS Strategic Decisions,
market volume for fax machines in western Europe increased by 9 per cent in
1991, giving a year-end total of 1.68m units sold, with Germany accounting
for 27 per cent, followed by Italy with 17 per cent, France 15 per cent and
the UK 12 per cent. In contrast, market value increased just 1 per cent in
1991, reaching USDollars 2.63m.
The general view is that plain paper fax (PPF) will be the strongest sector
and will represent 50 per cent of sales by 1995.
Not surprising, then, that the competition is getting stiffer, with those
launching PPFs this year including Canon, Infotec, Hitachi, Konica, Lanier,
Minolta, Mita, Mitsubishi, Oki, Olivetti, Panasonic, Pitney Bowes, Rank
Xerox, Ricoh, Sanyo, Toshiba and Triumph Adler.
BIS believes that plain paper for the small business/home office sector will
also develop, with low-cost ink jet technology predominating. The
residential thermal fax market will also develop over the next four years,
with price levels (under USDollars 400) and innovative applications (home
shopping, reservation and order confirmation services) boosting consumer
spending.
In the European market, Frost &amp; Sullivan researchers estimate that the
Dollars 3.54bn worth of sales in 1991 will rise dramatically to Dollars
7.64bn by 1996, with new demand created by changing work practices.
An example is multifunction machines for home-based users, with sales of
units combining telephone, answering, fax and PC-interface facilities rising
from Dollars 78m in 1991 to Dollars 517m by 1996.
It is a growth rate that should be music to the ears of suppliers such as
Canon, Amstrad and Panasonic as well as Brother and Fujitsu who offer plain
paper fax output via laser printer links.
On the question of fax machine manufacture, Frost &amp; Sullivan suggests that
the Japanese, with upwards of 90 per cent share of production to date, will
remain in control, either directly from Japan or manufactured within Europe
or the US.
This is underlined by the fact that, following the decision by Alcatel of
France to stop fax machine manufacture, only Sagem, Ricoh and Fuji Xerox now
have European production facilities.
However, having recognised the opportunities in the small and home-based
office market, Samsung of Korea has announced a two-year Pounds 4.5m
investment programme in a fax production plant at Teesside, UK, which will
operate as their European manufacturing and distribution hub.
At the higher end of the market, the emerging generation of enhanced fax
machines and services should prove particularly interesting, with
store-and-forward fax, payphone fax, networked fax and integrated
voice/fax/electronic mail showing strong growth.
Though the industry is beleaguered by lack of internationally recognised
computer-fax message communications standards, the US market as a key
indicator of future potential.
There, the standalone PC and network facsimile board market is expected to
grow from Dollars 62.9m in 1991 to USDollars 184.7m by 1996, with fax
network services growing ten-fold from Dollars 15.3m in 1991 to Dollars
156.8m by 1996. Developments such as the ability to transmit fax messages
from within applications will support the growth of computer-fax.
In this respect, the API (application programming interface) specification
agreed by the members of the US FaxBios Association may help.
The first to promote the initiative in a deliverable product is WordPerfect
with the launch of Works 1.0, a fully integrated software package that
allows users to fax documents anywhere in the world without leaving the
program.
But Tony Sellars of fax/data modem suppliers, Andest, believes that the
advent of the Windows operating system will be the main catalyst to the
wider-spread acceptance of computer-fax.
'With Windows, you can fax from within any application as easily as you can
print; in background and from within any application,' he notes.
Companies targeting the computer networked fax market include Communicate,
Comwave, Data &amp; Control Equipment and 4Sight. Rank Xerox is one of the few
to opt for an integrated fax machine/software approach (LanFax/Express 7033)
which can make use of DTMF dialling for routing inbound faxes direct to
workstations.
Other developments that make fax even more relevant in the PC market include
FaxGrabber for Windows from Calera Recognition Systems, the first utility to
enable fax images to be received directly into more than 50 applications,
including word processing, desktop publishing and spreadsheets, with all or
part of the received image capable of being converted into an editable text
file. The need to use Diskfax from Alpha Systems, or to print before faxing
or to convert images to editable files after faxing disappears. Computer
files can be transmitted disk-to-disk, at the touch of a button, over the
PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network), Inmarsat satellite links, Cellnet
or Vodafone mobile networks.
Typically used for financial consolidation where data integrity and security
are paramount, but ideal for transmitting exact copies of information stored
on floppy disks, including statistics, CAD/CAM files, graphics, spreadsheets
and reports, the system operates just like conventional fax, except that you
insert a disk, rather than a sheet of paper.
Enhanced fax services are only in their infancy, but with developments such
as the incorporation of optical character recognition for remote access to
fax mailboxes and computer databases (as already offered by Konica and
Xerox), voice annotation and speech-to-text conversion, an entire new realm
of applications and services not yet envisaged will be possible.
Both Ascom Telecommunications and UK-based TISL say that the uptake of
integrated voice and fax mail systems for international communications is
already growing rapidly in Europe.
As a result of demand, new features and facilities include automatic fax
message redistribution via DTMF dialling; multi-language greeting options
for callers wanting to leave a fax/voice message; and DDI (direct dial-in)
numbers enabling messages to go either direct to a fax machine or routed to
the user's fax/voice mailbox.
While sceptics of Group 4 fax say that faster 64K modems will enable Group 3
machines to offer ultra high speeds at lower cost, it is some years away
yet. Meanwhile, G4 over ISDN is a solution. As an example of the potential
cost-savings, Canon estimates that, by using its new L3300i fax rather than
a Group 3 machine to transmit 100 pages per day to the US, users would save
Pounds 4,735 a year.
The advent of ISDN also opens the market to colour fax technology to design
companies, printshops, advertising agencies, couriers, fax bureaux and
others able to justify the Pounds 20,000 unit cost. Both Canon and Ricoh
have colour fax machines in the wings, with Sharp the first to deliver a
machine offering no less than 262,000 different nuances of colour in 400dpi
resolution.
The market for mobile communications devices that integrate fax with
cellular phone, modem and pen-based computer technologies has led EO Inc. to
set up a partnership with AT&amp;T, Matsushita and Marubeni that will design,
build and market a new generation of personal communicators. The prize is a
share of a market destined to be worth Dollars 20bn by the year 2000

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (14): The stakes
are high - Private networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS REGULATORY barriers in the international telecommunications marketplace
are pushed aside, the pace of change in the provision of private network
systems and services is increasing at an unprecedented rate.
New strategic partnerships are being struck; new technologies developed; new
signalling protocols and standards agreed; new products introduced; new
operators licensed; new pricing structures published.
The stakes are high and the revenue potential significant. The market
research organisation, Frost &amp; Sullivan, estimates that the combined
European telecom equipment and services market will be worth Dollars 200bn
by 1996.
The 25-extension plus private telephone switch market is on course to ship
6.6m extensions a year by 1995 to realise annual sales of Dollars 2.4bn,
thereby consolidating its position as one of Europe's largest telecom
equipment sectors with an installed based of just over 40m extensions.
By 1996, Germany will have Europe's largest telecom equipment market
(Dollars 11.69bn), and the UK the largest services market (Dollars 30.24bn).
The pan-European value-added services sector is forecast to grow to Dollars
9.45bn by 1996.
It is no longer simply a question of corporate customers deciding how many
private circuits to install or even who should be the preferred supplier.
The advent of digital technology and the new rules of competition has opened
up a whole panoply of network, system, service and supplier options. Today,
customers can cherry-pick the elements and vendors that will enable them to
build and operate a fully-integrated, resilient network at an acceptable
cost.
The corporate network of the future will be flexible, adaptable and
upgradeable, able to respond easily - and with minimum disruption - to
changing business circumstances.
It will make full use of private point-to-point links for high volume, high
quality, non-stop and time and content-sensitive transmissions; and of
dial-up bandwidth on demand services to support ad hoc, peak overloads,
remote diagnostic, disaster recovery and private circuit backup
transmissions.
It will support integrated computing and telephony as well as the new
applications such as video-conferencing, high-speed fax, Cad/Cam
transmissions, voice and message mail, with Lans (local area networks), Wans
(wide area networks) and Mans (metropolitan area networks) interlinked to
form a seamless network capable of supporting office-based, home-based,
remote and mobile users, both nationally and globally.
Highlighting the trend towards resilient, distributed networks that can
support high volume voice and data applications, information providers Dun &amp;
Bradstreet have signed a Pounds 550,000 contract with Ericsson for the
installation of an MD110 ISPDX digital network at its European head office.
The system will be integrated with the company's existing global IDNX
network and will be the first in the UK to incorporate Ericsson's Team
voicemail processing system. Integrating networks is no easy task, says
Charles McGregor of Fibernet, a UK company that designs, supplies and
installs intelligent connectivity products for complex fibre networks within
organisations that face demanding requirements in voice, data and video.
The barriers are significant, not least because Lans are optimised for data
transmission and peripheral sharing while Wans are designed primarily for
telephony.
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and Sonet (Synchronous Optical Network) are
just two developments considered to be a large advantage in this respect.
ATM combines the best features of multiplexing and cell switching to create
a universal transfer method that will accommodate Lan and non-Lan data,
voice and video.
Sonet is deemed to be important for future wideband applications such as
high volume video-conferencing and Cad/Cam graphics transmissions.
Implemented with fibre optics, it is expected to save operations costs in a
number of ways including, for example, fewer amplifiers and connection
devices, far fewer lines for switching equipment to handle, and options like
adding or dropping bandwidth with no on-site technician needed.
Frame relay is another important development to the Lan-Wan interconnect
solution because it uses high-speed packet switching technology to handle
data traffic which has high peaks and requires high volume throughput
between a number of geographical dispersed sites, both nationally and
internationally.
The parcel transport company, United Carriers, is one of the first
beneficiaries of this technology. It has signed a Pounds 240,000 contract
with Gandalf Digital Communications for the supply of a future-proof frame
relay network to link its head office system with 20 depots, enabling
available bandwidth to be used more effectively for image-processing
applications and to carry X25 data traffic over a single KiloStream link.
Not all companies wish to install and maintain equipment on their premises.
The trend towards virtual private network (VPNs) and managed data network
(MDNs) services is also growing apace.
As an example, Mercury Communications has won an Pounds 11m, seven-year deal
to provide the Chase Manhattan Bank with a totally managed non-stop voice
communications network via Digital Centrex (central exchange), a service
that provides all the facilities of advanced PBXs without the need for
capital investment.
A five-year contract worth Pounds 15m has also been signed by TSB Retail
Banking and Insurance whereby Mercury will take over the management of the
bank's corporate voice and data network as well as the network that provides
services between 40 TSB main offices, thereby enabling the management to
concentrate more effort on core activities.
BT is winning business for its Global Network Services (GNS), a portfolio of
managed data networking services that provides large national and
international customers with a worldwide end-to-end communications service
with a single point of contact.
The addition of frame relay makes it particularly suited to the major stores
groups requiring synchronous and asynchronous communications capabilities
needed for modern electronic point of sale systems but which do not have the
resources to update their old multiplexers.
The future potential for such services can be gauged by the September 1992
London opening of the very first international Global Virtual Private
Network (GVPN) centre.
The new centre will co-ordinate order processing, worldwide dialling, plan
design, and implementation and management of customers' multinational
virtual networks, with staffing and funding provided by the GVPN
member-carriers.
Intelligent networks (see page 6) will also provide the ability
automatically to respond to a range of situations, such as changing
communications paths and facilities in the event of a failure, and will be
able to support the new generation of services such as the Personal
Communications Network (PCN).
However, as John Rance, executive general manager of Racal-Datacom,
cautions, the problem is that most users are too concerned with running
their businesses to keep up with the hectic pace of networking development.
'What may be the most cost-efficient route one week can become an expensive
liability the next,' he points out.
Key indicators of the shifts and pressures in the marketplace are the
introductions by BT of DualStreamplus, new Kilostream services and standard
call charge reductions effective from November for multi-site corporate
customers.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (16): How to
reduce paperwork - High-speed memos via electronic messaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN MORANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S growing tempo in industry and commerce means businesses must be more
responsive to customer demands. However, even though the ubiquitous fax has
made big inroads into the market historically enjoyed by telex, the real
need of most users is for electronic messaging directly to the screen of a
personal computer - either desktop or notebook - with paper copies only
being printed when required.
Similarly, new messages would also be prepared on the same PC, prior to
being 'mailed' electronically.
The concept is very beguiling as the last thing that any manager wants is a
further proliferation of paper on his desk. It should be feasible to send
and receive these memos and messages from wherever there is a telephone,
because the telephone network spans the globe.
In principle, electronic messaging is very simple: a user prepares a message
on his own PC, which must be equipped with a communications device, known as
a modem, and appropriate communications software.
He then dials into a central message-centre computer and, having completed
the logging-on process, which includes password and other security checks,
'down-loads' that message into an electronic pigeon hole, known as a
mailbox, on that host computer.
He, and other users, regularly dial into that same computer to check whether
there are any messages waiting in their individual mailboxes. These they
'down-load' into their PC. So the process continues, with messages and
reports being prepared, sent, received and read.
While this all may seem very complex, there are a growing number of
executives who regularly keep in touch via messaging systems. And the number
of users worldwide today may already be as high a 3m.
Typically, electronic message services today will allow messages to be
transmitted at speeds as high as 2,000 words a minute. However, the latest
data modems will support speeds of 30,000 words a minute and even higher.
Thus, in due course, it will become common practice to transmit even lengthy
reports from one end of the world to the other.
Even though many lessons have been learned from that early civil engineering
project - the Tower of Babel - it has taken a number of years for a
technical standard for message handling systems to be agreed
internationally. The operators have the task of converging their existing
services in the UK and elsewhere in the world to this standard, known as
X400. For example, BT has upgraded its long-established Telecom gold service
to BT Mailbox. Not only is this X400 compatible, it is backwards-compatible
with Telecom Gold and other Dialcom services worldwide. BT hopes that, in
the fullness of time, all its Gold customers will migrate to Mailbox with
its added features.
However, Mercury Communications, which at the end of last year announced its
MultiMessage service aimed at the large corporate client, is holding back
from taking a similar initiative because, according to Gary Muchmore,
Mercury's electronic messaging product manager, 'there is a need to get the
underlying communications standardised' as the majority of users will not
find X400 intuitive to use.
Services of this nature are not unique to the UK, or for that matter, merely
accessible in the country of origin. For example, the latest list from US
carrier MCI shows that there is local access to its MCI Mail service in more
than 25 countries - and the list is growing.
Similarly, IBMX400 is a service offered by IBM International in many
countries throughout the world. This is aimed at users of IBM mainframes and
allows them to connect to other IBM sites in their own and other countries.
The growing penetration of X400 will speed the growth of messaging. However,
when one first uses electronic messaging, it is often as an alternative to,
say, fax or some other, totally familiar, method. In addition to employing a
new technique, users must become familiar with many new mailbox numbers and
procedures.
The remedy for this is coming from an unlikely source - fax. Because a very
large proportion of documents that are sent by fax actually originate from a
PC, manufacturers of communications modems are increasingly incorporating a
fax facility.
A new generation of data modems, such as the Quantum 144 from Cray
Communications, support fax and extremely high data rates.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (10): Hoping for
a golden future - Mobile communications

<TEXT>
AFTER a rather hesitant debut, the bandwagon is rolling for Europe's digital
cellular radio system, GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications).
Originally planned for pan-European lift-off on July 1, 1991, GSM was
plagued by early difficulties. The highly complex, perhaps
overly-complicated system specification, led to delays in developing the
necessary software and hardware testing equipment to ensure that GSM phones
would operate equally well across the whole of Europe.
These difficulties have now been resolved and GSM systems are coming on
stream throughout Europe. Both UK operators are hard at work installing
their networks and, in the case of Vodafone will be offering coverage of
larger cities and linking roads by early 1993.
Cellnet are publicly planning a full national service in 1994, with local
and regional offerings in 1993. In Germany, thought by many to be Europe's
biggest potential GSM market, both networks are open for business.
Two of the three Swedish networks commenced operations on September 1 and
the remaining European operators who have signed the GSM agreement are
likely to be up and running within the next 12 months.
On the international scene, the prospects for GSM look bright. Many
administrations, looking to introduce deregulation into their
telecommunications, have chosen to do so in the mobile sector. Many have
licensed second operators to provide mobile services and in the majority of
cases have specified GSM as the standard to be adopted.
Despite its early problems, GSM is a 'here and now' technology and neither
of its international rivals is able to provide a viable alternative.
The US cellular industry has become locked into a spiral argument concerning
the technology to be used and the Japanese are thought to have selected a
non-exportable frequency band for their digital cellular standard.
So far this has left the international field clear for GSM, to the benefit
of European manufacturers who have invested very substantial sums in the
technology.
Two Australian networks will open in April 1993, with a third planned for
1994. New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong,the Philippines, Indonesia, China
and Taiwan have all agreed to adopt GSM and both Russia and India are keen
to switch on GSM networks.
This development gives GSM the status of a de facto world standard. However,
adopting the standard and building the network is relatively
straightforward, the problems arise when the search begins for customers.
The concern of many involved in cellular is whether there are sufficient new
customers to justify the expensive move to digital.
An important issue with some potential users is the security and privacy. As
recent highly publicised events concerning the British Royal family have
suggested, analogue cellular can be highly insecure. A strong selling point
of GSM will be that speech is coded and therefore cannot be overheard.
GSM will also offer users the possibility of international roaming, where
they will be able to use their pocket terminal anywhere in Europe and have
the bills sent to their home or office.
However, the size and value of the international roaming capability is
uncertain.
The Scandinavian experience, where users of the Nordic Mobile Telephone
(NMT) system are able to roam throughout Finland, Sweden, Norway and
Denmark, suggests very little.
In addition, operators of existing analogue networks who are now beginning
to see significant returns of their investment may be reluctant to push GSM
to their current subscriber base for fear of losing revenue.
If the prospects for GSM are cloudy, what are the chances of success for
Personal Communications Networks (PCN)?
The brainchild of Lord Young and the UK Department of Trade and Industry,
PCN was originally envisaged as the mobile communications system for the
mass market. Using low-cost, lightweight pocket transceivers, PCN would
bring mobility to the population at large.
Three operators were given licences and services were planned to start in
1993.
Since its inception however PCN has suffered from an identity crisis and a
failure to differentiate itself from other mobile technologies such as
cellular radio.
The costs of building a PCN network are massive, around half a billion
pounds, and already two of the operators, Mercury PCN and Unitel, have
joined forces to try and contain these costs. Many are questioning whether a
true mass market f or mobile communications of sufficient size to justify
this scale of investment actually exists.
In any event, a mass market for personal mobile communications can be
addressed by other technologies without the massive investment requirements
of PCN.
UK cellular operators Vodafone and Cellnet are working to ensure that PCN is
stillborn. Vodafone is planning to develop its GSM network to provide a PCN
like service which it calls Micro Cellular Networks, (MCN).
Like PCN, MCN will be targeted at urban users and will be implemented using
small cells and lightweight handsets. According to Vodafone chairman Gerry
Whent: 'MCN will launch the day before or the day after PCN.'
Both operators have recently made a pre-emptive bid for the popular market
by launching low cost tariff options on the existing analogue networks.
Richard Goswell, managing director of PCN licensee Mercury Personal
Communications is dismissive of these attempts to stifle the new technology
in its cradle arguing that both the low-cost tariff approach and MCN are too
complicated.
'Simplicity is the key to mass-market success,' says Mr Goswell. 'A customer
wants one handset to provide him with communication whenever - and wherever
 -he needs it.'
Mercury are planning to launch their service in south-east England mid-1993
and is confident that it can find the mass-market PCN needs to succeed.
On the European front, only Germany is proceeding with PCN and will be
issuing a singly licence later this year.
The German government sees PCN as a possible solution for the chronic
telecommunications problems of the new eastern federal states and has
already installed a small test system to assess its suitability.
The French administration has stated that it sees no necessity for PCN type
servi ces until the 21st Century and no other European country has any
publicly announced plans for PCN.
In the US, where PCN is known as Personal Communication Services (PCS), the
picture is equally cloudy. Although there is considerable enthusiasm for the
concept, the means of implementation is uncertain. The Federal
Communications Commission has issued over 150 licences for experimental PCS
systems-virtually all using different technologies.
At the heart of this dilemma is a simple question: are mobile communications
a useful tool to increase business efficiency or does the man on the Clapham
omnibus want a phone in his pocket?
Many in the mobile field are betting large sums of money that they have the
right answer to that question.
In the FT's Mobile Communications Survey, published on September 8, 1992, it
was suggested that the German wireless local loop programme, known as DAL,
utilised a variant of the NMT 450 analogue cellular telephone system, writes
John Williamson. LM Ericsson has asked us to point out that the technology
in question is the newer, higher capacity NMT 900 system.

suppliers - Eastern Europe

GPT, the UK telecommunications systems manufacturer, will not say how much
it makes out of its joint venture company in Moscow. But it is believed that
the profits are good.
GPT began in a small way in Moscow three years ago, installing pay-phones in
the tourist sections of the city. The venture, called Comstar, was carried
jointly with the Moscow Telephone Company.
Now GPT has built a digital overlay network in the city and claims to be the
only company which can provide access to the local phone network as well as
good quality international lines. Comstar is also one of the first to sell
western telephone systems in the CIS.
The CIS and eastern Europe have been a honey pot attracting just about every
leading telecoms company in the three years since the region began to open
up.
In all countries of the region, the state of the telecoms infrastructure is
poor, and relatively few people or businesses even have a telephone: there
are 15 phone lines per 100 population in the CIS, and even fewer in other
east European countries.
A modern telecom infrastructure is viewed as essential, in order to achieve
the economic improvement that the region seeks.
The cost of building that infrastructure will be several billion dollars,
but political and economic uncertainty, as well as bureaucratic
difficulties, means that many potential investors are proceeding cautiously.
'Everyone is making noises,' says Tony Cobb, deputy chairman of Comstar, but
he is sceptical of the true number of companies willing to put in serious
money.
According to Mike Bissett, of the PA Consulting Group, foreign telephone
companies embarking on joint ventures are mainly interested in how quickly
they can achieve good revenue growth.
Many western phone companies moved in quickly to install international
gateway exchanges.
International phone connections from eastern Europe and the CIS were
particularly bad in the past. People complained of having to book calls, via
the operator, several hours or even days in advance.
As western companies started moving in, demand grew way out of proportion to
the facilities available, and there was therefore a good business for anyone
willing to invest in an exchange.
'In the short-term, if you want to make a quick return, 'international' is
the way to do it. Our view is that that is short lived,' says Mr Cobb.
He hopes to have 5,000 phone lines connected to Comstar by the end of this
year, and 100,000 by the end of the decade.
The rouble revenues are being re-invested in a factory to make telephone
handsets, which will begin production at the beginning of next year.
Cable and Wireless recently invested Pounds 4m in Sovam Teleport, an
innovative venture between the US and Russia. Sovam has been sending data
from Moscow to the outside world since 1984. It provides a satellite link to
western databases and electronic mail services, and its customer list
includes many of the world's news organisations as well as multinational
companies such as Coca Cola, Du Pont and Barclays bank.
Sovam claims to be profitable. The Pounds 4m will be used to expand Sovam's
network into other CIS cities and improve its transmission facilities.
The American phone company, AT&amp;T, has invested in several international
exchange ventures, including an early one in Armenia. Most recently, it
joined with PTT Telekom Netherlands to set up a venture called Utel with the
Ukranian phone company.
An international switch in the Ukrainian town of L'vov went live in June
this year. Originally it had 30 lines to Holland and another 30 to the US,
but the service has been so heavily used that the number of lines to Holland
have been doubled.
The long-term plan for Utel is to build a trunk network throughout the
Ukraine. Thirteen exchanges will be installed, providing 6m new lines in the
next two years.
Other suppliers have moved in fast on mobile network opportunities. Mobile
phone networks can be constructed relatively quickly because they do not
require streets to be dug up. The investment is therefore much lower than
for a wired network.
The Baby Bell company, US West, has four mobile phone joint ventures:
Hungary, Czechoslovakia (together with fellow Americans Bell Atlantic),
Moscow and St Petersburg.
According to Steve Andrews, president of US West Spectrum Enterprises, the
Budapest network is going well. It has attracted 16,000 customers in two
years of operation.
The Moscow network has also grown fast, with 1,400 customers in less than
six months. But St Petersburg subscribers have been slower to sign up with
only 900 customers, although the network has been in operation for longer.
Andrews attributes this to lower numbers of foreign business visitors.
Sometimes, getting a venture going in eastern Europe is not as easy as it
ought to be: PTT Telecom Netherlands says that it has been waiting for
months for official registration of a new company in the Ukraine.
The company is Ukraine Mobile Communications, a consortium with Deutsche
Bundespost Telekom and Telecom Denmark. It has a licence to build a mobile
phone network, but cannot even begin to install any equipment until the
registration is complete.
Eurotel, the US-West/Bell Atlantic venture, struck a different problem on
its Prague network. It pitched the tariffs too high. The locals complained
that they could not afford the prices, which were affordable for westerners.
Eventually, Eurotel was forced to restructure the prices, and the venture is
now gaining subscribers.
James Hatt, regional director of Cable and Wireless, stressed that western
businesses have to be highly selective: 'Every day, three or four so-called
opportunities cross my desk. It has go to be more than an opportunity to go
in and merely 'make a quick buck.' It must be one that allows us to expand
as the economy stabilises and expands,' he says.
Local contacts are vital if a venture is to succeed, he adds. Western
companies need to get to know which people to target in the established
bureaucracy.
They also need patience, tact and understanding. For example, in the CIS
they may win a licence from the regime in Moscow for a network somewhere in
the outer regions of the country, but when they get out there, they may find
they have to negotiate all over again with the local administration.
'I've seen other companies have projects die on them because they did not
have the right level of political contacts,' says Mr Hatt.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (8): US battle
ahead - Baby Bells ring the changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US telecommunications industry is in the throes of a revolution as
technology, competition, takeovers and deregulation change the face of the
sector.
Probably the single most important issue facing the industry over the next
few years is the fate of the Baby Bells, the seven huge local telephone
companies which were created out of the court-ordered break-up of American
Telephone and Telegraph in 1984.
The break-up left the rump of AT&amp;T as a long-distance and international
telephone carrier and telecommunications manufacturer, while its local
telephone operations were carved up into the Baby Bell companies. They now
dominate the provision of local services, although in many parts of the US
independent companies, such as GTE, are the sole provider.
The result in the long-distance market has been fierce competition, with
AT&amp;T challenged by upstart rivals such as MCI, now the second largest
long-distance carrier, and Sprint.
AT&amp;T has been forced to become much more aggressive in its marketing,
pricing and customer relations. It still accounts for some 65 per cent of
the long-distance market, which is worth about Dollars 55bn, and seems to
have stopped the erosion of its position.
AT&amp;T has also moved aggressively to position itself for the expected
convergence of computer and communications technology through its 1991
takeover of NCR, the fifth largest computer manufacturer in the US, which
was merged with AT&amp;T's own struggling computer business.
A year after the deal, which was widely regarded as a high-risk strategy for
AT&amp;T, given the computer industry's history of failed mergers, the two sides
claim integration has gone remarkably smoothly.
Because the US local markets were regarded as 'natural monopolies', the
court which broke up AT&amp;T judged that the Baby Bells needed to be prevented
from throwing their weight around in other telecommunications markets. They
were therefore banned from equipment manufacturing, information services and
the long-distance market.
Ever since then the Baby Bells have campaigned to get into these markets and
last year they won an important victory when the courts allowed them to
enter certain parts of the potentially vast information services industry.
New technology, particularly the emergence of fibre optic cable as a more
efficient carrier of signals than the traditional copper wire, means that a
huge battle is shaping up over which companies will provide information
services to the American 21st century home - cable television operators, the
local telephone companies or other, independent providers.
The telecommunications companies won an important round in the battle last
summer when the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the
communications industry, gave the go-ahead for the telephone companies to
transmit television programmes to homes over telephone lines.
However, the FCC maintained a ban on the phone companies owning a
significant stake in producers of programmes and the phone companies are in
no position to take immediate advantage of the green light, since the local
network remains almost wholly wired with copper, which is not good for
transmitting video signals. The cable industry, furthermore, is also
protected from competition from local telephone companies by a 1984 act.
However, even as the Baby Bells are seeking new fields to conquer, their own
monopolies are under threat as never before. Whereas they could once enjoy a
quiet life collecting monthly fees for telephone services from a captive
clientele, and big commissions for linking up calls to long-distance
carriers, they now have to cope with:
Wireless technologies, such as cellular telephones and Personal
Communications Networks, which are likely to take a substantial proportion
of business away from the wired networks. Cellular telephone penetration of
the US market is still growing rapidly, in spite of recession, while
extensive tests of PCN systems are under way across the US.
GTE, for example, recently announced the largest market trial of two new PCN
systems, to take place in Florida's Tampa Bay area.
However, the Baby Bells are to a considerable extent protected from this
competition, since they are also among the largest cellular operators,
having been handed one of two local cellular licences by the government when
these were handed out. They have also been active in a takeover wave which
has been rationalising the patchwork of cellular operators left by the
original licensing process.
So-called 'by-pass operators' which use fibre optic cable to link business
customers to the long-distance carriers, by-passing the local companies. In
a big step towards ending the local monopolies, the FCC last month voted to
allow these upstarts to link up directly to the local telephone company as
well. It also proposed letting rivals use the telephone companies' networks
to reach all customers.
Cable television operators, increasingly concerned about telephone companies
entering their industry, have been taking the battle to the enemy and
experimenting with telephone traffic.
Faced with this onslaught, the Baby Bells have been trying to reshape
themselves. Jobs are being cut, top executives are suddenly retiring.
Mr Victor Schnee, an analyst and long-time critic of the Baby Bells, argues
that the local telephone system is like the Soviet empire in 1989, just
waiting to break apart.
In his recent book, 'The End of the Local Monopolies', he argues that 'in
the not-too-distant future there will be alternative networks everywhere
they are allowed . . .
'In short, the entire industry will turn inside out, to focus on a primary
goal it has always ignored - delivering something of value to customers -
rather than on creating networks and extracting profit from customers based
on artificial scarcity supported by government.'
The Baby Bells may take issue with some of Mr Schnee's arguments, but they
all know that some sort of upheaval is on the way. The question is, which
ones will adopt the best strategies to cope with this change?

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (7): France looks
far beyond home base - A new overseas offensive by France Telecom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THANKS to the French telecommunications authority, telephone subscribers in
and around the US city of Minnesota, last month plugged their personal
computers into a new electronic directory.
It is the first such service in the US which can be operated by so-called
'natural language,' whereby a user can just tap out a general question on
the keyboard and the computer will produce a list of services able to help,
from garages to dial-a-pizza.
The directory, provided by US West, one of the seven regional Bell telephone
companies, works by retrieving the answers to US subscribers' computer
demands, in a fraction of a second, from France Tlecom's database in Paris.
This is the latest example of how state-owned France Telecom, the world's
fifth largest telecommunications operator, is trying to catch up in the
trend for national telecommunications operators to compete outside their
home bases, either in alliance with or competition against local operators.
To make this possible, the French government has loosened the shackles that
bound the telecom service to the state since its birth in the early 19th
century, running a telegraph service for King Louis Philippe. France Telecom
was a department of the telecom ministry, under close political control,
until two years ago. Then it was transformed into a semi-autonomous
state-owned company, to give it the management flexibility to compete in
deregulated telecom markets in the European Community and around the world.
Since then, France Telecom has for the first time in its history gone on the
offensive in foreign markets.
It struck a landmark accord in March with Deutsche Telekom, the German
operator, to form a joint venture, Eunetcom, to provide worldwide
telecommunications services for international companies; a serious
competitor to Syncordia, a similar group being set up by British Telecom.
Early last year, France Telecom even challenged British Telecom on its home
turf, when it launched Transpac Network Services in the UK to operate
private telecommunications networks - like Eunetcom - for large companies.
It was the first time that a national telecommunications operator from one
European country had tried to compete on the fixed networks of another.
In a smaller UK deal, France Telecom has also teamed up with the Swedish
national telecom operator to take a 25 per cent in Ram Mobile Data, a
British company which offers data transmission by mobile telephone.
Further afield, it has over the past year taken stakes in Telmex, the
privatised Mexican telecom operator and participated in a takeover of
Argentina's northern networks, to gain an entree into what will be fast
developing markets, ripe for modernisation. A similar strategy was behind
its two first deals in eastern Europe, to open a mobile phone network in
Poland, with Ameritech, one the US regional operators and to help set up a
pageing system in Czechoslovakia.
If France Telecom has been busy abroad, it has also continued to be active
at home, where it is continuing to enlarge its networks, develop areas where
it lags international competition, like mobile phones.
Turnover rose by 7 per cent to FFr115bn last year, on which France Telecom
made a pre-tax profit of FFr16bn. However, that dropped to a mere FFr1.6bn
net after the FFr14.5bn annual levy which the state charges France Telecom.
The levy, the last remaining legacy of its history as a state agency, will
disappear at the end of next year, when the group will start to pay normal
corporate tax. This would have added around FFr6bn to net profits last year,
estimates Mr Marcel Roulet, group chairman.
As in previous years, last year's sales expansion was led by a strong growth
in business traffic. Facsimile machine use rose by 50 per cent, while
computer data transmission was up by 12 per cent. The number of lines rose
last year from 28m to just over 29.1m, of which 80 per cent are now
connected to digital exchanges, giving France one of the highest levels of
digitalisation in the world.
This modernisation of what was 20 years ago one of Europe's worst telecom
services, has permitted a steady improvement in quality.
Digitalisation has also permitted a fast expansion over the past year in the
number of subscribers to Numeris, the integrated services digital network
which allows voice, data and pictures to be piped down the same line.
Numeris had 150,000 subscribers nationwide by the end of last year, six
times more than in 1990.
Minitel, meanwhile, has continued its relentless growth, with a 7 per cent
rise in the number of terminals to 6m. French citizens spent a combined
total of more than 105m hours last year tapping away at their Minitel
keyboards, making use of more than 15,000 services. By far the most popular
of these is the electronic telephone directory.
The project, launched 11 years ago, in part owes its fast growth to France
Telecom's controversial policy of giving away terminals, has been criticised
by the Cour des Comptes, the government's financial watchdog, as a waste of
money.
A recent audit by Coopers and Lybrand for France Telecom disagrees, pointing
out that Minitel will have made a FFr4.3bn profit in the 16 years to 2000,
if the extra traffic it generates is taken into account.
One of the operator's weak areas continues to be portable telephones, use of
which is still one quarter of that in Britain. Here France Telecom is
staking everything on the future generation of Group Special Mobile (GSM)
digital mobile phones, launched in Paris and Lyon in July, and a
complementary network of cheap mass-market pocket phones, nattily named
Bi-Bop, for use in cities.
France is one of the first European countries - along with Germany - to
introduce GSM, the big advantage of which is that it offers a big increase
in capacity over existing analogue mobile networks.
France's current two analogue networks, run by France Telecom and its one
private sector competitor, Societe Francaise du Radiotelephone, already have
around 375,000 subscribers between them, near their 400,000 subscriber
maximum capacity.
With GSM in place, France Telecom believes that mobile phones will provide
around a fifth of its income from telephone charges by the end of the
decade. It will mark a radical change in French telephone users' habits.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (6): Hurdles for
new contenders - Duopoly challenge in UK telephone services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TELECOM ELECTRIC is the working title of the latest venture to announce its
intention to challenge the British Telecom/Mercury Communications duopoly. A
subsidiary of National Grid, and headed by two of the industry's most
experienced heavyweights, it has enough of the right ingredients to give BT
something to think about.
Gordon Owen, former group managing director of Cable and Wireless, and David
Dey, former managing director of business communications at BT, are putting
their team in place at National Grid House in south London. With careful
planning, the new company could begin operating a phone service within two
years.
Its two main rivals are British Rail Telecommunications (BRT) and American
phone company, Sprint International. Assuming they all receive licences from
the Department of Trade and Industry, these three could end up jostling for
position as the third leading force in telephone service provision.
According to Mr Owen, who led Mercury through its early days, there is
plenty of room for new entrants to take market share: 'There is still a lot
of work to be done on BT. They haven't relinquished their monopoly in any
shape or form. Economists define a monopoly as 75 per cent. BT still has
90-something per cent.'
If they win the go-ahead, these new players would use new fibre optic cable
technology, which they say they could deploy quickly. BRT already has the
cable in place throughout a large part of Britain and would only have to
install telephone exchanges and software to begin providing public services.
Sprint has rights to install cable along the British Waterways canals, and
Telecom Electric could use the electricity pylons and under-the-street ducts
to carry cable.
They have the advantage over British Telecom that they can design their
entire network from the beginning using the latest transmission technology.
Known as synchronous digital hierarchy or SDH, it provides better quality
and higher speed lines. It also has a number of automatic fault-clearing
capabilities. This should reduce the maintenance costs, as well as cut down
on engineering time spent sorting out problems.
Andrew Burroughs, vice president of marketing at Sprint International,
estimates the cost of installing fibre at between Pounds 100m and Pounds
500m, depending on the extent of the network - 'we do believe there is a
market for a company that offers fibre connections between key cities here,'
he says.
It is likely that all three could seek to tie up with some of the smaller
companies now looking at providing local phone services. Cambridge-based
Ionica, and US company Millicom are both licenced to provide local phone
connections via radio instead of cable. They will build regional , rather
than national networks, and will need to get trunk connections from one of
the larger players.
Ionica is already negotiating with Mercury on this basis. However, once
there are other alternatives to Mercury, they are likely to choose the one
which offers them the best deal. Similarly, cable television companies are
looking for favourable deals on long distance telephony. They are signing up
customers for phone services, which are carried on the same wires as the TV
programmes. This market has been slow to develop since Windsor Television
offered the first phone services on a Slough trading estate in the late
1980s.
But now Cable London, which has a network installed in parts of Camden,
Harringey and Enfield, claims to have 8,000 telephone subscribers only two
years after it began laying cable. And Cambridge Cable is confident of
gaining telephone subscribers following the launch of its service this
month.
However, all competitor phone companies still have to face a number of
hurdles. The most critical is something known as an 'inter-connection
charge.' This has to be paid to BT on each call made - it covers BT's costs
for delivering calls to subscribers with a BT phone.
According to Terry Rhodes, director of competition policy at Mercury, the
inter-connect charge is the highest cost for any new entrant. Mercury
expects that it could be asked to pay BT around Pounds 200m this year, which
is approximately equal to its staffing costs.
The issue which has been raised by Mercury for many years, but has not been
resolved, is how much it costs BT to provide that local connection. BT
claims its local loop costs are high, but there have been many questions
raised about its accounting procedures.
Terry Rhodes is currently in discussions with BT and the regulator Oftel to
get this charge reduced. If he succeeds, the new players will benefit - 'you
can't open services unless you sort this out,' he said.
The other hurdle is investment. Mercury claims to have spent Pounds 1.5bn on
building its network, which is still not complete. It is now looking for an
equity partner in order to share the investment burden.
According to Gordon Owen, new competitors have a significant advantage over
Mercury. He points out that they are permitted by Oftel to lease capacity
from BT or Mercury and resell it. This means that they could offer voice
telephone services which operate over lines actually owned by BT or Mercury.
It would allow them to get started with a lower cost-base. They could begin
generating income relatively quickly and transfer customer traffic on to
their own network as they build it. Mercury was not permitted to do this and
had to build the network from scratch.
National Network, a small, privately-owned company which has also applied
for a telecoms licence, is already reselling capacity. It uses the Post
Office network of private leased lines. However, it is finding the going
tougher than expected. Although it offers savings on BT prices, it is
offering deals to large customers.
BRT, Sprint and Telecom Electric are more likely to compete on service
levels and on marketing skills. They can be expected to introduce telephone
services that neither BT nor Mercury offer - these could include higher
capacity leased lines, or they could use new software capabilities in
telephone exchanges for advanced call-diverting facilities.

in Europe - Total deregulation is still a long way off

<TEXT>
BRUSSELS is well aware that the development of Europe's telecommunications
infrastructure is essential to obtain maximum benefit from the single market
and to strengthening the EC's global competitive edge. It is estimated that
more than half of EC jobs depend on information and communication
technology. Telecommunications alone are set to account for around 6 per
cent of the EC's GDP by the year 2000.
The Commission estimates full liberalisation of the EC's telecom market
would double its rate of growth, and increase by four the size of the market
over the next 20 years.
But despite several years of market reforms and a plethora of EC directives
and recommendations which have succeeded in opening up the terminal
equipment market and a substantial part of telecommunications
infrastructure, the vast majority of EC telephone services is still under
the control of state-owned monopolies.
The Commission strategy to crack open the crucial voice telephony market,
which account for 90 per cent telephone services is centring around just a
small section of that market: cross-border phone calls. And like previous
deregulatory moves, the Commission's aspirations look set to face resistance
from EC member-states every step of the way.
Paris' successful stab at persuading the Commission from even discussing the
plans until after the French referendum on Maastricht clearly illustrated
political sensitivities in the sector. The French government feared that an
attack on France Telecom would have been the last straw for many undecided
voters.
The cornerstone of EC telecommunications policy is the much-read 1987 Green
paper. The document emphasised opening up the terminal equipment -
telephones, faxes, modems and the like - to free competition and the
part-liberalisation of the telecommunications service business.
In 1988, the Commission issued a directive to open up the EC's market for
terminal equipment to competition. The aim was to allow consumers to benefit
from new technology and design by giving them a free selection instead of
the 'Hobson's choice' offered by many of Europe's telephone monopolies.
In order to do so, the Commission took advantage its mandate under Article
90 of EC competition law: this allowed the commission to bypass the EC's
Council of Ministers and the European Parliament to pass legislation to stop
member-states maintaining measures contrary to the Treaty of Rome rules on
the free market.
But there was one institution which the commission still had to reckon with:
the EC's constitutional watchdog, the European Court of justice.
France, backed by a number of other EC countries, challenged the
Commission's right to the use of Article 90.
Their main concern was that they would be left out of future discussions on
the abolition of their national telephone monopolies. Three years later, the
court ruled the commission was acting legitimately in relation to state
measures affecting telecommunications undertakings where these measures were
at odds with the treaty. But a looming court decision slowed down
liberalisation as private sector investors were hesitant to take up the new
opportunities until the political situation was more certain.
The Commission faced similar contention from mainly the southern EC states
when it focused its attentions on prising open the ten per cent or so of the
services market that was not voice telephony.
A deal was reached at the end of 1989 between the Commission and EC
governments for a strategy to introduce competition for what is known as
value-added services, including electronic mail and data bases and the
resale of data communication services from January next year.
The commission was allowed to consider prolonging the resale of capacity of
leased lines for those member-states whose network for packet switched data
transmission services was not yet sufficiently developed.
Member-states were also allowed to impose obligations on private service
providers in the field of basic packet or circuit switched data
transmission, if the activities of the private operator jeopardised the
delivery of basic services.
Even so, the package was quickly challenged in the Court of Justice by
France, Belgium, Italy and Spain. The judgment is not due until the end of
the year.
Liberalisation of the EC's telecommunications market is not possible without
giving private operators access to the vast telecoms infrastructure.
The basic principles of the open network framework directive, adopted in
1990, is the harmonisation of the technical characteristics of the EC's
telephone networks, the conditions of their usage and tariff principles.
The most important piece of legislation in the ONP framework adopted to date
is a directive laying down the conditions for leased telephone lines.
Two other proposals aimed at encouraging competition and beefing-up the
quality of phone services and which will be significant for users were
adopted by the Commission in July.
The first proposal would introduce a common EC-wide licensing system for all
providers of phone services. Once implemented, this will mean that companies
approved to offer certain voice services in one EC country would
automatically obtain the right to do business EC-wide.
The second piece of legislation, the directive on open network provision for
voice telephony, at the same time laid down basic guarantees for ordinary
residential telephone service users but which also obliged government-run
telephone companies to provide crucial inter-connection services for outside
operators.
The directive also set minimum quality standards to be provided by
member-states on services such as the length of time to install a new
telephone and minimum compensation rules if the services are not provided.
Opposition from France and other EC governments to Commission plans to open
up to competition - even a fraction - of voice telephony services, stems
from the belief that only by maintaining large monopolies will Europe be
able to fight off Japanese end American infiltration of the market.
'We are not against liberalisation, but we feel the aim should be the
creation of a European telecommunications network,' said Bruno Janet,
spokesman for France Telecom, pointing to the creation last September of a
European network for data transmissions between several of the EC's
telephone monopolies.
His company points to the relative health of the EC's telecommunications
sector where profits increased from Ecu 91m in 1978 to Ecu 383m in 1991, as
proof that there is no need to hurry in deregulation.
Even under British Telecom's own reckoning, French telephone tariffs are the
lowest in Europe.
France is also arguing that unless a strategy for the liberalisation of the
whole of the voice telephony sector is worked out, it will be private
telephone subscribers - who lack the vociferous lobbies of business users -
who lose out.
Europe's telephone companies tend to finance less profitable services with
the money-spinning international calls sector. They are calling for more
time and 'greater reflection.'
What is certain is that however much the EC's Competition Commissioner, Sir
Leon Brittan, would like otherwise, total deregulation of voice telephony in
the EC is still a long way off.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (4): A fresh
approach - Telecom ventures / Development funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MONICA HORTEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS AUTUMN in the US, a new group of telecommunications specialists starts
work at the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in Washington. Their
brief is to provide funding for new telecommunication ventures around the
world, and signals a new approach to investing in infrastructure by the
World Bank Group.
The IFC is the arm of the World Bank which looks after funding for
commercially-oriented entrepreneurial ventures. It compliments the World
Bank's wider role in assisting governments with public infrastructure
projects.
Traditionally, the IFC has only funded relatively small telecommunications
projects such as regional paging networks. The long-term and more costly
infrastructure installations remained strictly within the domain of the
World Bank, which provided substantial loans to governments.
Now that many governments are looking to the private sector to build and run
infrastructure projects, it seemed appropriate for the IFC to take a wider
role in telecoms. The IFC has been given a boost to its funding and has a
remit to provide finance for very large projects, although the World Bank
will also continue with its interest in the sector.
Typically, new projects today are financed using a combination of loans from
several sources. Money from the World Bank, IFC or other aid body, could be
put together with direct investment by a foreign telephone company, as well
as funding contributed by the government or network operator itself.
Eastern European countries can also apply to the European Investment Bank or
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, (EBRD).
For example, Bulgaria is getting Dollars 150m for an overlay network to
connect the main towns and cities. More than half is coming from the
European Investment Bank, and from funding generated by the Bulgarian phone
company itself. The rest will be provided by the EBRD and the World Bank.
Telecommunications networks are considered an attractive investment
opportunity, because they can generate large profits once the network has
been installed.
Yet organising funding for new projects can be fraught with problems. A big
factor in a decision to invest in telecomms is the political stability in
the country which is looking to install the network. This is because the
government retains the right to regulate tariffs, radio spectrum,
way-leaves, and many other issues which affect the phone company's ability
to carry out its business. In a shaky political environment, investors tend
to run shy.
Most of the interest among the lending bodies at the moment is turning
towards eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). But
interest is also reviving in some Latin American countries, such as Chile
and Mexico, where the political environment is becoming more friendly to
outside investors. However, each of the lending organisations operates
differently. World Bank loans are agreed between the bank and the government
of a country. Of the total sum lent, a portion may be for
telecommunications. Loans are normally for 20 years, with a five-year grace
period.
The IFC acts more like a commercial bank. It could, for example, choose to
take an equity stake in a venture, instead of just lending the money.
According to Tim Nulte, a principal economist at the IFC, it will look for
projects that offer a good commercial return, but it will act with a social
conscience. This means that rural networks will not be neglected in favour
of those serving business or large metropolitan markets where the profits
are more obvious - 'under the right conditions, independent phone companies
can be a very good business,' he says.
Some eastern European countries are keen on the idea of having lots of small
phone companies, which they believe could get phones into people's homes and
offices more quickly than the incumbent monopoly phone company. The IFC
could look favourably at this concept, based on the success of smaller phone
companies in the US.
Telephone companies invest directly in new networks by taking an an equity
stake. They also take a proportionate share of the profits. They therefore
look for the projects which have the greatest commercial viability.
However, the phone companies also have to carry some of the risk in local
currencies: they have to accept payment from subscribers in roubles, zlotys
or forints, and re-invested the money locally. Some lending agencies have
been criticised for only taking repayments in hard currency. But they have
to borrow the money on the world financial markets in order to make the loan
in the first place. They have to get hard currency in order to meet their
own commitments.
All investors in new telecomms networks put forward certain prerequisites
before they will hand over any money. Nick Williams, a partner at Touche
Ross management consultants, says that most lending agencies want to ensure
that the regulatory environment is favourable to generating profits. They
insist that the government restructures the telecommunications sector. The
first step is usually to hire a foreign management consultancy to assess how
best to do this. The money to pay for consultancy studies is often obtained
as a direct grant from individual government's overseas aid funds.
According to Nick Williams, there is a widely-held view that a strong,
monopoly phone company that has the opportunity to get going on a firm
footing, with perhaps the prospect of competition at a later stage.
Telecommunication networks can start earning revenue quite early in their
life: as soon as a new exchange is in place, it can start putting through
calls. The income from the first stage is normally ploughed back into the
business, to build up the network.
Typically, the 30-40 per cent of the infrastructure cost which is
self-funding, and that has to come from revenue generated. There is a fear
that if competitive networks, along the lines of the British or US model,
were introduced, it could damage the chances for these brand new networks to
develop profitably.
Lending agencies also like to see that steps are in place to turn the phone
company from what was an unresponsive state-run organisation into a
commercially sharp one. There is a need to learn financial and commercial
skills which they have not previously needed. These include double entry
accounting, cost centres and marketing.
A particular concern in this sense is tariffs. In much of eastern Europe,
call-charges are still priced the same way they were under the old communist
regimes. Mr Williams explains that most tariffs are too low to generate the
revenue needed to meet the loan repayments, yet to raise charges is
politically unacceptable. In some cases, tariffs should be raised by 200 per
cent. For example, in Czechoslovakia, the government decided recently not to
increase it. Yet a new digital overlay network will require Dollars 1.5bn in
funding, and the call charges are around 2p for an untimed local call.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (2): Momentum
remains strong - Privatisation programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S President Carlos Menem put the country's telephone company Entel
up for sale in 1989 at a time when the economy was in terminal decline and a
restructuring of the public sector was urgently needed if the country was
ever to dig itself out of a mounting foreign debt crisis.
While the profits motive was the driving force behind the privatisation of
Entel, the telephone company, it was not the only factor. The Menem
government also recognised that an efficient telephone system is essential
for any modern economy.
Entel's network was antiquated and over-stretched after years of neglect,
and one of the pre-conditions of the privatisation was that the new owners
would modernise and upgrade the telephone system.
When the Singapore government said it intended to privatise Singapore
Telecom a year later, it had a different set of objectives. Singapore
already had one of the most modern and sophisticated telephone networks in
the world.
Singapore Telecom wanted to bring in private investors to assist with its
transition from a state utility to a dynamic multinational competing for
business in both its own and overseas markets.
Privately-owned telephone companies like BT and American Telephone and
Telegraph had already started to move into the provision of global
telecommunications services to multinational companies, and any telephone
operator that failed to react to the threat that they posed ran the risk of
losing its most lucrative business customers.
Bessel Kok, the chief executive of Belgacom, the Belgian telephone operator,
listed the various objectives of privatisation programmes illustrated by
Entel of Argentina and Singapore Telecom, at an international conference in
Amsterdam in June organised by IBC Technical Services. Mr Kok put the
objectives of privatisation under three headings:
Financial objectives:
I. To reduce government deficit, often linked to a broader goal of reducing
the public sector's involvement in the telecommunications business.
2.To create stable mechanisms to raise investment funds, which implies
demonstarting a good prospect for the business and solid management.
Political objectives:
To encourage popular capitalism via widespread shareholding and special
arrangements for small shareholders. Margaret Thatcher's crusading
privatisation programme in the UK in the 1980s trumpeted the claim that
Britain would become a nation of private shareholders.
Business objectives:
1. To transform a state monopoly into a competitive business. This means not
only creating internal shock within the company but also opening the
business to external scrutiny.
2. To obtain technological know-how, this objective is absolutely essential
for developing countries.
3. To create international alliances with other service providers, which
could be defensive or offensive.
Such is the momentum of the push towards privatisation, that it is difficult
to keep track of the sell-offs in process. At the last count, there were
eight completed privatisations, six telephone operators were in the middle
of privatisation programmes, and there were 12 planned privatisations.
Latin America and its new wave of right-wing presidents has been the biggest
privatiser, and the catalyst for privatisations in other countries with
large foreign debts.
Argentina, Mexico, Chile and Venezuela have all sold majority shares in
their national telephone companies while Brazil, Uruguay, and Costa Rica all
have planned privatisation programmes. Interest has crossed the Atlantic to
Africa over the last one to two years where governments in Kenya, Nigeria
and the Sudan are working with the World Bank on privatisation programmes.
In Europe, British Telecom has set the pace and the example for others to
follow. Since its privatisation in 1984, BT's profits have climbed steadily
and are now hovering at around Pounds 3bn a year - or, as the UK tabloid
press prefers to say, Pounds 95 per second.
The tax windfall and the proceeds from the sale - the 25 per cent of BT that
was sold last year valued the company at Pounds 24bn - are the major
enticements for Chancellor Kohl in Germany to privatise up to 49 per cent of
Deutsche Telekom. The German operator will spend up to DM70bn modernising
the east German telephone network between 1991 and 1997 and is in dire need
of new funds.
Deutsche Telekom is also pressing the German government for a part
privatisatlon because of concern about losing large German customers to new
competitors and losing out in the race to develop global services.
Stung by tighter regulation in the UK and competition from Mercury
Communications, BT has embarked on a global expansion programme and aims to
steal major German business accounts from under the nose of Deutsche
Telekom.
The Deutsche Telekom privatisation will be in 1996, if the government can
push it through parliament next year. In addition, Swedish Telecom, Telecom
Finland, the three Portugese operators TP, TLP and CPRM, Telecom Eireann,
the Hungarian Telephone Company and Czechoslovakia's two operators are
either being privatised, or are being considered by their governments as
possible targets for privatisation.
Privatisations are providing telephone companies in Europe, the US and
south-east Asia with an opportunity to off-load some of their monopoly
profits. The trend in privatisation programmes to date has been for
governments in developing countries to sell their telephone operators to
other telephone companies, while in the UK, United States shares have been
placed on the stock market.
Leading buyers of telephone operators include the US Baby Bells, Cable and
Wireless and the Spanish operator Telefonica. Bell Atlantic and Ameritech
bought 100 per cent of Telecom New Zealand in 1990 and will reduce their
joint stake to 49 per cent by 1994.
Telefonica, meanwhile, has bought into Entel in Argentina and two Chilean
operators.
The momentum of privatisation programmes remains strong. According to
studies by Booze Allen and Hamilton and the World Bank, some 30
privatisations will take place between now and 1995, with the goal to raise
over Dollars 150bn.
But at the end of his presentation at the Amsterdam conference this summer,
Bessel Kok at Belgacom raised an important question: 'Will there be enough
capital?'
This question, he says 'will be particularaly critical for
telecommunications in developing countries.'
Investors will become more selective, he says, and opportunities in Europe
and the Pacific Rim might be seen as safer bets than countries like Nigeria
and the Sudan.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of International Telecommunications (3): The race
hots up - Super carriers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLIAMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AUGUST, leaked internal documents disclosed the scope of BT's ambition to
become one of the two or three 'super carriers' projected by some analysts
to dominate the global telecommunications market by the end of the decade.
The documents revealed the existence of a secret plan to spend around
Dollars 1bn on the construction of a worldwide business telecommunications
network by the year 2002. Dubbed 'Cyclone,' the planned BT network will
offer leading international corporate customers voice, text, data and video
services as part of a 'virtual' private network. Virtual private networking
exploits special computer software to share common transmission and
switching facilities between different customers.
This arrangement gives each customer the considerable advantages of using a
private network at a much lower cost than actually owning such a facility.
Cyclone will kick off next year with the installation of large
telecommunications switching centres in London, New York, Frankfurt and
Sydney. BT will spend around Dollars 86m in the first year of building
Cyclone. In subsequent phases, an additional 28 network hubs will be added
in the biggest business centres across the globe, starting with Paris and
Tokyo in 1994.
A main plank in BT's super carrier strategy is the capture of a large share
in the growing market for 'outsourcing' - in other words, provisioning and
managing the private networks of the world's leading international
corporations.
Such enterprises are presently spending around Dollars 3bn to communicate
with their overseas offices and subsidiaries, and the market is growing at a
rate between 15 per cent and 20 cent annually.
Handing over control of a company's communications function to an outside
contractor is prompted by two main considerations:
First, outsourcing can slash up to 20 per cent off the corporate
telecommunications bill.
Second, subcontracting the telecommunications function allows companies to
concentrate on those activities which are, in the first instance, their
raison d'etre.
The notion of the super carrier, offering worldwide networked services to
leading corporate users, has inhabited the pages of analysts' reports for
some time now. Last year, BT attempted to kick-start the market with
formation of its Syncordia global managed network and outsourcing
enterprise. With headquarters in the US, Syncordia was originally intended
to marry the talents of BT with those of its German and Japanese
counterparts, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom (DBT) and Nippon Telegraph and
Telephone (NTT).
The plan was that this alliance would divide up the key US, European and
Asia Pacific markets between its members, offering service packages for the
management of existing private networks, and the construction and operation
of new ones.
As well as end-to-end management and round-the-clock, multi-lingual customer
'help desks' in a number of centres around the world, Syncordia's repertoire
was to be extended to include international cashless calling, worldwide
private numbering and mobile services for corporate users.
'We have great ambitions for Syncordia,' said BT chairman Iain Vallance at
the company's launch. 'We intend to be the leading providers of outsourced
networking services and we intend to set the industry standard for those
services.'
The ambitions remain but the effort to expand Syncordia's ownership has not
panned out as BT originally intended. Negotiations with NTT are understood
to have ceased, and the likelihood is that the Japanese carrier will now
only function as a distributor of Syncordia products in Japan.
Talk in BT is now about winning more customers for Syncordia, rather than
signing up more partners. Meanwhile, having collectively failed to agree
terms for Syncordia membership, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and France
Telecom have formed their own outsourcing venture, Eunetcom.
According to a recent issue of Telecomeuropa's regional newsletter, the odds
are that Spain's national operator Telefonica will also join Eunetcom.
Italy's telephone company SIP is also a possible partner.
Additional competition has appeared in the form of Unisource, an enterprise
formed in October 1991 to combine the international businesses of the Dutch
and Swedish PTTs.
In June 1992, the Unisource partnership announced a major agreement to
interconnect its facilities to those of US carrier Sprint. Last month it
sold a third of the shareholding in one of its two operating companies to
the Swiss national telecommunications carrier.
Discussions are continuing to find additional European participants, and the
hunt is on for a partner in the Asia Pacific region. US carriers will play a
critical role in shaping the overall super carrier sector.
Aside from the Sprint deal with Unisource, and a recent tie-up between MCI
and Canada's Stentor, all the US candidates for the super carrier slot have
so far kept their cards pretty close to their corporate chests.
In this increasingly confrontational environment, there is some scepticism
about BT's ability to go it alone.
'Companies who try to 'go it alone' will find it very cold out there, very
expensive in terms of capital outlay, and high risk,' says John Buckley,
director of telecommunications at the PA Consulting Group. 'Strategic
alliances, whether you like it or not, are probably the way to go.'
Peter Wilkinson, a director of the UK's Quotient Communications consultancy,
notes that the earlier Syncordia initiative did not win any friends for BT
in Europe and sparked defensive European alliances which are likely to
recruit more members in future.
The Cyclone initiative, he says, will provoke a similar response worldwide.
While acknowledging that globalisation and outsourcing is potentially the
biggest and most lucrative market for internationally-oriented carriers in
the 1990s and into the next century, PA Consulting says that there are many
issues as yet unresolved.
On the regulatory front, it is unclear what will, and what will not, be
sanctioned from country to country. Many would-be corporate customers are
chary of handing over the operation of so vital a part of their activity as
telecommunications to the former monopolies whose inadequacies led to the
boom in private networks in the first place. There is also a question mark
over the present-day competence of PTT-like organisations in the highly
complex business of sophisticated private networking.
According to Mr Buckley, one way to overcome lack of expertise is to buy
into, or form partnerships with, existing private network operators, either
in-house or those set up to serve particular interest groups such as banking
and transport. Here, with its recent purchase of the Nedlloyd transportation
group's telecommunications network, the Unisource partners may have stolen a
march on their larger competitors.

THE world telecommunications industry is in the midst of a radical
restructuring, driven by the need to survive in a newly dynamic and
competitive global marketplace - and to exploit fast-changing technologies
which can give customers a competitive edge.
Already many of the old boundaries and regulations in the Dollars
300bn-a-year worldwide telecommunications service sector have crumbled, and
others are under attack.
Historically, the highly protected national post and telecommunications
organisations (PTOs) which controlled domestic and international
telecommunications had little incentive to improve efficiency, introduce new
services or cut charges.
Generally they they faced little, if any, competition and were able to
develop their business at a leisurely pace, often with little apparent
regard for customer needs. Because their foreign counterparts also enjoyed
monopoly status, there was little opportunity to expand overseas.
But beginning in the early 1980s this cosy relationship began to be rocked
by three powerful and inter-related forces - privatisation, liberalisation
and globalisation. In the wake of the court-appointed break-up of the Bell
system in the US other countries, led by the UK in Europe and Japan in the
Far East, began adopting policies designed to foster competition.
Since then, the PTOs in many nations have been split into separate post and
telecommunications administrations, with the telecommunications business
sold to the private sector.
This process continues to gather pace: according to Booz-Allen Hamilton, the
management consultants, between 1991 and 1993, telecom companies in a
further 26 countries, responsible for 95m lines, are expected to be
privatised. In Europe, Deutsche Bundespost Telekom, Germany's state-owned
telecommunications group, plans to raise DM20bn from a privatisation sale on
international markets. However, Mr Helmut Ricke, chief executive, said last
month that the flotation would not be possible before 1996 at the earliest
and less than 50 per cent of the company would be sold.
With their monopoly rights abolished, or at least curtailed, many of these
newly-privatised telecommunications groups have began to follow their
multinational business customers and expand globally through acquisition,
strategic alliances, or as stake-holders in consortia bidding for new
operating licences.
British Telecom is among those with ambitious international plans. The UK
carrier is planning to invest about Pounds 500m over the next 10 years to
build an overseas network infrastructure to support its ambition to become
the world's leading telecommunications group. The investment project,
code-named Cyclone, will start with the installation next year of four large
computerised exchanges in New York, Frankfurt, London and Sydney, followed
by a further 28 switching centres in main business centres worldwide.
In addition, BT has set up Syncordia, a US-based subsidiary designed to
provide sophisticated telecommunications services to multinationals.
Syncordia, based in Atlanta, Georgia, was originally intended be a strategic
partnership between BT and its German and Japanese counterparts, Deutsche
Telekom and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone.
But the effort to expand Syncordia's membership did not work out as intended
and while there is continuing speculation about possible new partners,
Deutsche Telekom has broken away and formed a rival enterprise called
Eunetcom with France Telecom.
NEVERTHELESS, these and other moves underline the revolution in the
structure of the industry that is taking place against the backdrop of a
market that continues to expand at 10-15 per cent a year. International
telephone traffic grew by 13 per cent last year to about 35bn minutes and
has increased six-fold over the past decade, according to the London-based
International Institute of Communications.
Across the range of international telecommunications services, the
traditional order is being challenged by a new generation of
telecommunications service providers - including some that own no physical
hardware at all.
Mr Gregory Staple, a Washington-based communications lawyer and editor of
the International Institute of Communications's recently published study of
the global communications market,* argues that the business of providing
international telecom services is going through a 'paradigm shift.'
Most international telecommunications services are still provided by
national carriers which inter-connect their 'half-circuits' to provide
end-to-end communications channels. These facility-based or 'heavy carriers'
jointly own the international cable and satellite systems which make up the
backbone of the global network.
Over the past decade, technology and competition have begun to challenge
this model - advances in micro-electronics, fibre optics and network
software on the one hand, and progressive market liberalisation on the
other, 'have brought forward a new paradigm for end-to-end global service,'
says Mr Staple.
The new model is being pioneered by a novel type of 'light carrier' which
provides international service by re-selling, re-routing, re-packaging or
re-programming the offerings of the heavy carriers.
'Primarily software-based, the 'light carrier' is a telephone company in
name only. It is driven by services and applications not facilities, and it
may not own a single transmission cable or satellite circuit,' he says.
The largest of this new generation of 'light carriers' are companies like
Electronic Data Systems (EDS), Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) and
General Electric Information Services company (GEIS) which already manage
the cross-border private line and data-processing requirements of leading
multinationals and have annual revenues of several billion dollars.
Liberalisation is one of the main factors fostering the growth of these
services and lower international call prices. For example, last month the UK
government joined a handful of others in sanctioning a new form of
competition called 'simple re-sale' on routes from the UK to Australia,
Canada and Sweden.
Simple re-sale will allow operators to lease international circuits in bulk
from British Telecommunications and Mercury Communications and resell
services. Customers will be able to access the resellers services via the
public telephone network - which has Turn to back page of survey
A changing marketplace

not been permitted under the more restricted form of resale allowed since
last year.
Government motives behind moves towards privatisation and liberalisation
have been mixed. In the UK, the driving force was the political conviction
that private ownership would be more efficient than public ownership. But
elsewhere other factors have been more important. In some developing
nations, including those in eastern Europe, the prime motive has been a
recognition that central government lacked the funds to modernise and extend
the inadequate networks.
However, privatisation and liberalisation have almost always gone
hand-in-glove because although many governments were prepared to tolerate
state-run monopolies, they have been much less willing to sanction private
sector monopolies.
Even those governments, such as Germany and France which have retained a
large element of state ownership in the telecommunications sector, have also
found it desirable to liberalise the market and introduce competition, for
example in the provision of cellular mobile services.
But liberalisation has not necessarily meant de-regulation. Indeed, to
ensure fair play for new entrants in liberalised markets many governments
have actually established tougher regulatory regimes. Most governments have
also stopped short of totally abolishing monopoly rights and have not
necessarily moved in step with each other.
In Europe, the European Commission has so far only required competition in
terminal equipment and data services and not in basic voice telephony,
although some governments - like the UK - have moved considerably further
down the liberalisation path.
After much discussion and delay, the Commission has still to unveil the next
stage of its programme to open up the Dollars 110bn European
telecommunications sector to full and harmonised competition. While the aim
is to create a market with lower prices, a wider variety of services and
more intensive use of telecommunications, the French government in
particular continues to oppose further rapid liberalisation in Europe.
Nevertheless, the Commission can claim credit for pushing ahead with the
Groupe Special Mobile (GSM) communications digital standard which, according
to Dr Peter Radley, director of Alcatel's mobile communications division,
'has been a great European marketing success,' and, despite its complexity,
has helped give European equipment manufactures a key advantage over their
international competitors.
Indeed, European equipment manufacturers have emerged well-placed from the
wave of consolidation which has already swept through the telecommunications
equipment sector to produce just a handful of really big players.
According to Dataquest figures, the league table is now led by Alcatel of
France with Dollars 15.53bn of revenues in 1991; followed by Siemens of
Germany, including its UK-based GPT 40:60 joint venture with Britain's GEC;
AT&amp;T of the US; Canada's Northern Telecom; NEC from Japan; Sweden's
Ericsson; and Motorola of the US.
'The ranking clearly shows the continued concentration of the telecoms
equipment industry in the hands of a declining number of suppliers,' says
Dataquest. 'Global companies continue to grow by acquisition and alliances
as they are forced to expand internationally . . national companies are
finding it increasingly difficult to fund the R&amp;D necessary to survive
alone.'
This international R&amp;D effort has already delivered technologies such as
fibre optics which are changing the face of telecommunications. Other new,
and often software-driven, technologies like digital cellular mobile
telephony, low earth orbit satellite systems and desktop video conferencing
are now emerging from the research laboratories. And although integrated
services digital network (ISDN) services have been slower to take-off than
many predicted, there is little doubt that in the longer term voice and data
communications and data processing systems are converging.
Advances in technology are enabling the network operators to assemble more
flexible, customised and value-added communications services like electronic
mail, enhanced fax and on-line computer services often aimed directly at
business users.
For example, one of the latest acronyms to emerge from an industry which
generates more buzzwords than most is the 'VPN' or virtual private network
which enables business customers to use the public network as if it were a
private network, with all the advantages of cost savings, maintenance and
support.
In developing countries, including eastern Europe, cellular mobile systems
are helping provide an alternative to unreliable and over-stretched fixed
wire systems while in the West new lightweight low-cost digital Personal
Communications Network services could finally provide a real mass market
alternative to the hard-wired telephone.
The main beneficiaries from this new era of liberalised telecommunications
services are likely to be the industry's customers who have been demanding
more application-specific system solutions to gain or maintain a competitive
edge in their own industrial sectors.
These customers stand to gain from access to a much wider range of more
competitively-priced and higher quality products and services delivered by
the survivors of the current maelstrom.
Already, customers in many countries are beginning to enjoy the benefits of
lower prices and better standards of service, for mobile as well as fixed
services. But there is still a long way to go. Mr Staple estimates that at
least 60 per cent of the world's 580m telephone subscribers still pay
relatively high prices for making international calls simply because of
where they happen to live.

FT  15 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS reported a much more orderly and sedate performance from the
derivatives markets, writes Steve Thompson.
In stock index futures the December Footsie contract opened at 2,629 and
progressed up to 2,638 in relatively subdued early trading, but then began
to slide as it reacted to a rather uninspiring showing in the cash market
where a number of big lines of stock were said to have been on offer.
Sentiment was further weakened by at least two large programme trades. The
absence of much rumoured takeover activity also dampened enthusiasm.
Expectations of a cut in German interest was dashed when German bonds began
to ease.
The opening of Wall Street found December at the day's lowest level of
2,605, but it then embarked on a good rally which left it at 2,622 by the
close, 10 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of around 32
points.
Turnover was a disappointing 6,651 contracts.
In stock options there was heavy activity in Grand Metropolitan which
attracted 5,129 contracts, as a leading house was said to have carried out a
series of big trades in the January 390 calls, along with the January 360
puts and calls. British Gas attracted 1,595 contracts and BT 960 contracts.
Total turnover in stock options at 25,741 was also disappointing.

FT  15 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities lower as rate cut hopes fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE disappointing UK economic data, the absence of a further reduction in
domestic interest rates and the lack of a much-rumoured Footsie takeover bid
combined to produce a disappointing performance by the UK equity market.
Also, lingering hopes in the markets that the Bundesbank may sanction a
reduction in German interest rates all but disappeared as German bonds
dipped in response to news that the Bundesbank was not planning a
post-meeting press conference.
News of further job losses at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, one of the market's
important marketmaking firms, after UBS said it was pulling out of making
markets in some 200 smaller stocks, came after the market close but had been
rumoured around the City's trading rooms during the session.
UBS is the third big trading firm to reduce its smaller companies dealing
book in the past couple of months, following similar moves by SG Warburg
Securities and County NatWest.
The UBS cutbacks in smaller companies' trading coincided with news that the
Stock Exchange is planning a new trading system, called the Stock Exchange
Alternative Trading Service, or SEATS, expected to get underway on November
16.
Under SEATS a single marketmaker in any stock will be allowed to operate
along with the Stock Exchange's current Bulletin Board system.
The Footsie 100 Index closed the session a net 10 points lower at 2,574.7.
The Footsie Mid 250 Index performed broadly in line with the premier index,
ending the day 9.9 down at 2,401.0 and the all-encompassing Footsie 350
settled 4.9 off at 1,237.0.
Share prices began the day in reasonable form, edging ahead to record a 2.1
gain at 2,586.8 within the first hour of trading. But a big share placing in
Glaxo plus a brace of programme trades, both sizeable and weighted to the
sell side, took the heart out of the market, driving the Footsie down to a
day's low point of 2,562.9, down 21.8, as Wall Street opened.
The New York market looked uncomfortable at first but quickly stabilised
after news of slightly better-than-expected retail sales for September and
was showing a minor gain as London closed.
Dealers noted the appearance of a handful of buying orders as the market
moved towards the close, eventually leaving the Footsie 100 well above the
day's low.
The absence of the rumoured takeover bids in the banks area did not deter
buyers in the sector with HSBC and Barclays both well supported and heavily
traded.
There was above-average turnover in TSB although traders said there was no
evidence of any stakebuilding activity. Paper, packaging group Arjo Wiggins
fell again as house broker UBS lowered its profits estimates.
Turnover in equities was a disappointing 487.1m shares. Customer business in
the market on Tuesday was valued at just short of Pounds 900m.
The leading insurance brokers, Sedgwick and Willis Corroon came under
persistent pressure, with Sedgwick especially vulnerable to bear selling.

FT  15 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Big line of Glaxo placed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERFORMANCE of pharmaceuticals group Glaxo was held back by a large
placing of shares at a hefty discount to the market price. Securities house
County NatWest, which carried out the deal, was believed to have taken on
3.7m shares at 758 1/2 p and sold 2.7m of them at 765p, thus taking a turn
of 6 1/2 p a share.
The stake represented employee share options - the right but not the
obligation to buy shares at a pre-set price, that were exercised. Glaxo
shares had opened at 790p but tumbled 20p following the placing. There was
also talk that news on an Aids drug being developed for Glaxo was not quite
as positive as hoped. A conference in California has been discussing the
merits of 3TC.
It appeared that County might still have had 1m shares on its book following
the placing. However, the Glaxo share price recovered with the market to
close 9 lower at 782p on final turnover of 10m shares.
Arjo downgrade
Paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton fell a net 7 to 151p as one of the
company's brokers cut its profit forecasts. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, joint
broker with Cazenove, argues that the company is well run but external
economic pressures are taking their toll.
UBS has sliced around Pounds 30m from its 1993 estimate, which is now
between Pounds 190m and Pounds 200m. The broker feels that the economic
situation in Europe shows no signs of improvement and is especially worried
about the position of carbonless paper. Carbonless prices have fallen by 30
per cent recently and Arjo controls a third of the European market. The cut
follows a reduction in 1992 estimates by County NatWest last week.
Ladbroke sold
A punchy, no-holds barred sell recommendation from Kleinwort Benson did the
day's main damage in Ladbroke. The shares reacted to the note by retreating
6 to 149p, making it one of the day's biggest declines in percentage terms
among FT-SE 100 stocks.
In a hard hitting salvo, Kleinwort said of the stock that there was too much
recovery expected by the market, too many uncertainties, too many
adjustments which can be made to the accounts, too little disclosure and,
'too much blind faith required by investors for the shares to justify their
current rating'. Some 4.7m shares were traded by the close.
Hotels group Forte closed 3 lighter at 150p. There were whispers in the
market that the new changes to the board announced yesterday could lead to a
cut in the dividend.
Shares in brewing group Grand Metropolitan bucked the market trend, closing
a penny firmer at 377p, having touched 379p, earlier in the session. County
NatWest were reported to be behind the revived fortunes of the stock. Mr
Graeme Eadie at the broker believes the shares are a good buy for long term
funds, suggesting the recent falls have been overdone.
A hefty 6m shares had changed hands by the close of business.
Investors took the view that the recently announced coal pit closures
particularly in the Midlands were likely to hurt Scottish &amp; Newcastle, a
large supplier to the area. The shares fell 18 to 399p, on volume of 3.6m.
Abbey National dropped 6 to 309p on criticism that instigation of its
mortgage rate cut, announced on Tuesday, was being needlessly delayed.
A strong performance in the Hong Kong stock market on Tuesday drew attention
to Hongkong Shanghai Bank, which lifted 13 to 437p.
Shares in BT held recent strong gains despite general weakness and fears
that it could lose business to rival companies offering cheaper telephone
services. The shares have risen almost 30 points since a couple of big
sellers left the market 10 days ago. They closed only a halfpenny easier at
369 1/2 p.
ICI lost 10 to 1053p with Credit Suisse First Boston reiterating a low 1993
forecast of Pounds 680m. However, Nikko Securities argues that the soon to
be split chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant will fare better. It sees the
company benefiting from sterling weakness a pick-up in new drugs and the
latent value to be released by the forthcoming demerger.
Generators PowerGen and National Power fell sharply as investors considered
the possibility of a regulatory investigation into pricing and scheduling.
PowerGen also suffered after County NatWest put the company on its
influential '30' list of underperforming stocks. It replaced property group
MEPC, which eased 3 to 274p. PowerGen and National Power were the worst
performers in the FT-SE 100 Index in percentage terms. They fell 13 apiece
to 267p and 256p respectively.
Furniture group MFI suffered another clutch of profits downgradings, this
time from SG Warburg and Smith New Court. Smith reduced its current-year
estimate by Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 65m, saying that in common with other
retailers the company had suffered from sales losses over the last three to
four weeks. The shares eased 3 to 110p.
Turnover in Sears hit 10m with the shares steady at 86p.
A positive statement that accompanied better than feared results at greeting
card retailer Clinton Cards caused the shares to jump 10 to 71p. The market
was also cheered by the held dividend.
Insurer Legal &amp; General fell 12 to 352p after announcing that new business
from life and and pensions annual premiums fell to Pounds 144m in the first
nine months of 1992 from Pounds 175.2m last year.
Insurance broker Sedgwick fell sharply in early trade on speculation that it
might be the subject of a DTI inquiry. The shares were down 14 at one stage
and the slide prompted the firm to issue a statement saying it had heard
these rumours but they were untrue. After the statement the shares rallied
slightly to close 7 off at 134p. Conglomerate Williams Holdings gave up 9 to
267p after broker Hoare Govett trimmed its current year profits forecast by
Pounds 3m to Pounds 157m citing continued weakness in UK construction.
Thames Television jumped 18 to 168p. The company is believed to have been
seeing its big shareholders over the past two days and it has a significant
stake in ITN, which has received a Pounds 30m commitment from a consortium
of four media companies. SG Warburg highlighted the the potential of the new
Channel Five and argued a Thames asset value of up to 210p a share.
Engineer Siebe was down 17 at the day's worst on fears that a profits
decline in a division of a US competitor may indicate a similar picture
emerging at Siebe, speculation that was soon discounted by analysts. A line
of stock was also said to be on offer. The shares later regained some of the
lost ground to close 10 lower at 331p.
Glynwed International ran back 12 to 214p, after agency broker Carr Kitcat
joined other houses which have reduced profit expectations. Carr shaved its
current year figure by Pounds 3m to Pounds 34m, to take account of the poor
second-half trading particularly in the copper tubes division.
News of the cutbacks in the coal industry led to a fall in several equipment
suppliers to the industry. These included Dobson Park, where the shares gave
up 9 to 47p, and Charter Consolidated, 8 lighter at 515p.

FT  15 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sees modest fall after
erratic trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Wall Street
US STOCK markets ended a see-saw day with modest losses yesterday as
investors continued to digest the latest round of third quarter corporate
results, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 5.94 at 3,195.48.
After opening lower, the index recovered to post a 15-point gain by early
afternoon, before selling in the futures market sent it to a 20-point
decline at 3.30pm, a decline that was only partially reversed in the last
few minutes of trading.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.02 firmer at 409.32,
while the Amex composite eased 0.66 to 366.17 and the Nasdaq composite fell
0.21 to 576.23. Turnover on the NYSE was 174m shares.
Losses in Tokyo, London and other European markets set the tone for a
downbeat opening in New York, and after two days of substantial gains, there
was no real resistance to early selling, mainly by European investors. The
release of the latest economic news - a 0.3 per cent rise in both retail
sales and producer prices during September - had little impact on sentiment.
As some more good third quarter corporate earnings figures came in, shares
soon regained the ground lost in the first half-hour, but amid continued
uncertainty about the economic, political and earnings outlook prices
fluctuated wildly for the remainder of the session.
One of the best corporate stories of the day was Coca-Cola, which climbed
Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 1/2 in turnover of 1.7m shares after the soft
drinks giant announced third quarter profits of 41 cents a share, up from 34
cents a share a year ago. The company also said it was 'on track' for 'very
strong' earnings for the full year.
Pepsico, which also reported strong quarterly profits on Tuesday, was
firmer, up Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 39. Bank of New York rose Dollars 1/2 to
Dollars 44 5/8 in busy trading after the bank reported a 66 per cent rise in
earnings to Dollars 1.07 a share. Another regional banking group, Republic
New York, was unchanged at Dollars 43 after news that it had won approval
from the Federal Reserve to conduct full-service securities brokerage
business through a subsidiary.
International Paper fell Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 61 1/8 after the broking
house, Dean Witter Reynolds, lowered its rating on the stock from a 'hold'
to a 'swap' to reflect the postponement of price increases for linerboard
and uncoated free sheet paper.
On the Nasdaq market, selected leading technology issues were higher, with
Apple up Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 46 and Borland International up Dollars 1
5/8 at 29 5/8 .
Canada
TORONTO share prices closed lower in moderate trading, following the trend
set in major world markets. According to preliminary data, the 300 composite
index lost 19.46 points, or 0.61 per cent, to close at 3,195.39. Declines
led advances by 304 to 201, volume of 23.6m shares was below the previous
24.5m, and trading value was CDollars 215.6m against CDollars 183.6m.

HOPES of an interest rate cut boosted share prices in the morning, but the
Nikkei average closed lower on late-afternoon arbitrage unwinding, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 146.64 to close at the day's low of 17,344.03. The
index rose to the day's high of 17,714.04 in the morning on futures-related
buying and small-lot buying by foreign investors.
Volume rose to 250m shares from 204m. Advances led declines by 494 to 414
with 183 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 1.34 to
1,318.90 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.69 to 1056.56.
The overnight rise of Nikkei futures in Chicago, prompted by hopes of an
early cut in the discount rate, pushed up the futures contract in Osaka,
triggering arbitrage buying. Investment trusts, and foreign investors joined
in.
'There was active buying by European investors,' said Mr Chris Newton at
James Capel. He added that some European investors have started to show an
interest in allocating funds to Japan.
But buying interest dried up later in the day as institutional investors
failed to follow suit. Meanwhile, share prices were unaffected by the
resignation from parliament of Mr Shin Kanemaru, former vice president of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the country's most powerful
politician.
Expectations of high sales growth of Interferon, the hepatitis drug, boosted
some chemical and pharmaceutical issues. Sumitomo Chemical, the parent
company of Sumitomo Pharmaceutical which sells Sumiferon, the country's
second largest-selling drug, rose Y5 to Y478. Inabata, a trading company
which holds 25 per cent of Sumitomo Pharmaceutical, advanced Y50 to Y1,140.
China-related stocks rose ahead of Emperor Akihito's visit to China on
October 23. Yaohan Japan, the supermarket chain which plans to set up a
retail chain in China, advanced Y60 to Y1,400.
Speculators targeted Lion, the toiletries maker, which rose Y14 to Y635 in
the day's most active trading. Rumours that the company is developing a fuel
from palm oil triggered heavy buying orders.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 12.60 to 19,185.98 in volume of 20.7m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets concentrated on domestic issues.
HONG KONG closed at the day's high after an afternoon buying spree which ran
against the market's cautious tone ahead of today's airport talks.
The Hang Seng Index finished 50.67 higher at 5,806.77, most of it gained in
the afternoon. Turnover was little changed at HKDollars 2.41bn.
SINGAPORE closed mixed in brisk trading with shipyards coming under light
selling pressure. The Straits Times Industrial Index edged up 0.97 to
1,333.85 on volume of 47.3m shares against 41.5m on Tuesday.
A specialist rig-building company, Far East Levingston Shipbuilding, was
among the key losers after it announced that its Danish client, AP Moller,
was not accepting one of the two rigs it had ordered. FELS lost 11 cents to
SDollars 2.66 in volume of 414,000 shares.
SEOUL was lifted by across-the-board buying. The composite index rose 10.57
to 524.96 with turnover at Won182.3bn after Tuesday's Won119bn.
Pohang Iron and Steel Co (Posco) and Korea Electric Power Corp, both heavily
weighted on the index, gained momentum and accounted for nearly 10 per cent
of the day's volume.
A bourse watchdog body said that foreign investors placed buying orders for
370,000 shares in Posco, open to foreigners for the first time.
KUALA LUMPUR closed higher but off the day's best as profit-taking emerged
in the afternoon.
Institutions held off ahead of the Malaysian budget as the composite index
closed up 1.43 at 606.56 in volume of 117m shares after 97.7m.
AUSTRALIA traded half-heartedly to close lower, with depressed metal prices
and pessimism about the domestic and international outlook sidelining
potential buyers. The All Ordinaries index fell 3.1 to 1,453.8 in turnover
of ADollars 179.75m.
Nickel prices reached a 34-month low in London overnight. In line with the
softer prices, Western Mining finished down 1 cent to ADollars 4.14 with
2.3m shares traded. CRA, ex-dividend, fell a net 3 cents to ADollars 11.58.
NEW ZEALAND ignored Wall Street's overnight gain and positive domestic
economic data and ended the session flat. The NZSE-40 capital index lost
0.54 to 1,390.63 after an intraday high of 1,398.02.
MANILA's composite index fell 11.75 to 1,386.81. Combined turnover climbed
to 11.2bn shares worth 632.62m from 5.04bn shares valued at 331.1m.
BANGKOK rose by 1.2 per cent on better foreign interest, and a move into
finance sector stocks. The SET index closed 10.97 higher at 879.65 in
turnover up from Bt8.5bn to Bt10.3bn, the finance sector gaining 3.4 per
cent.
BOMBAY opened weak, and subsequently took a severe beating to close with the
BSE index 82.13, or 2.6 per cent lower at 3,1O5.63.

FT  15 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses mixed before
Bundesbank meeting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The continent put in a mixed performance yesterday, and trading remained
thin ahead of today's Bundesbank meeting, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell as the government was told to raise income tax allowances,
the market taking the view that the lost revenue would have to be made up
elsewhere. Among individual stocks, Veba came under pressure as the Dax
index ended 6.97 lower at 1,458.53.
Veba fell DM10.90 to DM341.10, hit by two rumours: that the company faced
large costs for environmental cleaning at a Berlin site, though this was
denied by the company; and that Dresdner Bank had downgraded its earnings
forecasts for the utility group, but this was also denied by the bank.
Leading chemicals were also the subject of profit revisions from two
research houses, DB Research and CSFB, which cut back their profit forecasts
and predicted 1992 dividend cuts from Hoechst and BASF. But dealers said the
news had no impact on the sector which moved in line with the market.
Pharmaceutical shares, led by Degussa and Schering, posted the day's
strongest gains. Degussa closed at DM287, up DM8.50 Schering DM13 higher at
DM663.
MILAN jumped 2.7 per cent on the final day of the October trading account on
a combination of professional short-covering and buying by domestic funds
and brokers in anticipation of a firm start to the new account. But foreign
investors were largely absent, taking the view that the recent rally was
mainly technical. The Comit index rose 10.48 to 404.76 in turnover estimated
at a high L250bn after Tuesday's L164bn.
Fiat and Generali continued to fuel the market's rise. Fiat rose L291 or 7.1
per cent to to L4,391 on continued rumours, denied by the company, that the
car group was close to some kind of agreement with Toyota of Japan. Fiat was
also lifted by the short covering of a reported 12m shares. Generali rose
L1,150 or 4.2 per cent to L28,760.
PARIS remained short on ideas, which was reflected in the paltry turnover of
FFr1.28bn. The CAC-40 index ended 17.16 down at 1,667.93.
Euro Disney continued to rise, adding FFr1.80 to FFr76.50, but off the day's
high of FFr77.80, on a report that its US parent planned to reduce the
financial pressure on its subsidiary.
The fall in the dollar contributed to the decline in building material
stocks, with Lafarge losing FFr8.50 to FFr271 and Saint-Gobain dropping
FFr14 to FFr482.
AMSTERDAM finished on a weaker note, following a softer dollar and declines
on most European bourses. The CBS Tendency Index fell 0.4 to 106.7.
Chemicals shares sustained the heaviest losses as several analysts
downgraded their profit forecasts. DSM fell Fl 1.50 to Fl 87.80 and Akzo
lost Fl 1.40 to Fl 133.40.
MADRID followed the downtrend established elsewhere, the general index
closing 1.03 lower at 191.65. The talking point of the day was the fall of
Pta45 to Pta925 in Telefonica, apparently due to selling by one domestic
broker. The company held a presentation for analysts in Madrid yesterday,
but this was expected to be neutral in its effect.
OSLO closed mixed with the airline, DNL, up and rig stocks down. As the
all-share index fell 1.05 to 335.91, DNL rose NKr2 to NKr58 on news that a
small competitor named Norway Airlines faced bankruptcy. Most rig shares
fell after rising by some 30 per cent in a week, Wilrig losing NKr5 to NKr20
and Ross Offshore NKr3 to NKr24.
STOCKHOLM was little changed as the Affarsvarlden General index eased 0.9 to
674.9 in turnover of SKr354m after SKr264m.
Astra remained firm, with its A shares adding SKr7 to SKr517, while
profit-taking took Procordia B shares down from SKr74 to closed unchanged at
SKr69.
S-E Banken C shares fell SKr0.50 to SKr12.50 ahead of its eight-month
earnings report today.
VIENNA's 18-share ATX index rose just 0.06 to 778.73 in quiet trading ahead
of the Bundesbank meeting today.
ZURICH's SMI index fell 4.2 to 1,889.3. Chemicals saw some profit-taking,
with Ciba bearers SFr9 easier at SFr621.
HELSINKI was slightly higher ahead of interim results from five Finnish
banks today. The HEX index rose 0.35 to 606.78.

FT  15 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Rise in volume reflects ERM turmoil -
William Cochrane explains the reasons for the surge in European turnover
last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, European equity investors and traders came back from their
summer holidays to the partial collapse of the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism (ERM). International investors made big changes in their portfolio
weightings, and turnover figures for the top eight bourses soared by 37.3
per cent in September.
The gain over July was just 5.1 per cent, but, says Mr James Cornish of
County NatWest which produces the turnover figures, the ERM realignments and
the currency turmoil surrounding them were far more important than the
return from holiday in producing the upsurge.
This September saw turnover in European Seaq International stocks in London
up by 73.7 per cent over August, reflecting the influence of international
investors and their need to deal in size.
In some cases, the wages of virtue were no more rewarding than the
consequences of running a soft currency. For its return to fiscal probity,
Switzerland saw a 7 per cent gain in the SMI index, while in the effectively
devalued UK, the Footsie index climbed by 10 per cent over the month.
The fall in the dollar at the beginning of September, the thin Yes majority
in the French referendum on the Maastricht treaty and the resulting
devaluations and floatings had moved international investors, in particular,
to take advantage of currency gains: by selling equities lifted by currency
appreciation; and by buying UK equities thought to be beneficiaries of the
weaker sterling.
UK turnover, and UK equities, rose in tandem. But in France, where the franc
withstood the currency storm at the cost of higher interest rates,
revaluation against several trading partners and a savage reduction in
earnings estimates, the CAC 40 index managed an appreciation of just 3 per
cent on the month as turnover more than doubled.
In Spain, share prices fell on poor first-half company results. The peseta
devaluation particularly hurt the utilities sector, but banks enjoyed a
mid-September rally which was halted sharply when the Bank of Spain imposed
exchange controls.
Performance was mixed, too, in the D-Mark bloc. In Germany, the slowdown in
the economy, exacerbated by the costs of integrating the eastern Lander,
coincided with devaluations of currencies covering a fifth of German
exports, according to Barclays de Zoete Wedd Strategy.
This combination put particular strain on cyclical stocks as the DAX index
fell nearly 5 per cent over the month. Turnover rose by only 7.3 per cent,
falling below that of London in dollar terms - and this in spite of the
effective devaluation of sterling - for the first time since December 1991.
Switzerland, meanwhile, is regaining its 'safe haven' status after a period
of rising inflation and high interest rates which bedevilled the market
during the late 1980s and early 1990s. The Swiss franc has appreciated
against the D-Mark this year and the Zurich equity market outperformed the
rest of Europe during the third quarter of 1992, further raising its
cumulative performance since the beginning of the year.
The Netherlands might appear to be in similar case, with a rise in turnover
of 47 per cent on the month, compared with 48.7 per cent in Switzerland.
However, says James Capel, while the ERM reshuffle brought better volumes
last month, average daily turnover of Fl 555m (Dollars 346m) in the third
quarter had receded from the Fl 645m of April/June.
'Recently,' says James Capel, 'we learned. . . . .that foreign investors, on
balance, sold Dutch equities worth Fl 1.4bn in Q2. This was the 10th
consecutive quarter of net foreign sales, totalling Fl 9.9bn over this
period. Our impression is that this trend was continued into Q3.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: DM up on Bundesbank report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING and the dollar lost ground against the D-Mark yesterday as the
markets leaned increasingly towards the view that there will be no cut in
official German interest rates today, writes James Blitz.
The number of dealers betting on a rate cut has dwindled this week.
Yesterday, the Bundesbank injected DM16.1bn into the money market, once
again at the reduced rate of 8.9 per cent. But the central bank's monthly
report contained another aggressive commentary about the need to curb
inflation. 'The Bundesbank must endeavour further to maintain its control
over monetary expansion and continue its stability-orientated policy,' the
report said.
The announcement that there will be no press conference after the council
meeting today also helped to push the dollar down to a close of DM1.4630.
However, the currency stabilised following US retail sales figures for
September which rose 0.3 per cent against forecasts of a 0.5 per cent gain.
Although this does not dispel the view that growth in the US remains
sluggish, there is a growing belief that the dollar will strengthen sharply
against the D-Mark after the US presidential election.
Sterling's weakness was compounded by newspaper suggestions that the
deepening gloom in UK industry may force the UK government to cut base
rates. The Bank of England's operations this week imply that policy will
remain tight for the rest of the month, but the pound still lost two
pfennigs against the D-Mark yesterday, closing at DM2.5000.
Assuming that there is no change in German rates today, the immediate
prospect for the currency market depends on two factors.
First, dealers will be looking for an indication of when the German rate cut
will come. A widely-held view is that the Bundesbank will ease the discount
rate before the end of the year.
But, according to Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in
London, turbulence could sweep currency markets again if the impression is
given that a cut will not materialise in the near future.
ERM currencies will also be affected by the outcome of the extraordinary
summit of EC leaders in Birmingham tomorrow. Until the end of last week, the
weaker ERM currencies - the peseta, escudo and Irish punt - had been heavily
sold because dealers believed that their formal devaluation was imminent.
The market has given politicians the benefit of the doubt in recent days,
believing that they may move to a more flexible form of ERM. European
leaders could acknowledge the need for regular currency re-alignments or a
two-speed Europe. 'But if the leaders do not agree on it,' says Mr
Lyons,'then the market will provide it for them.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Money Markets: BoE firms policy

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPECTATIONS of a near-term cut in official interest rates in both Britain
and Germany faded yesterday after the Bank of England and the Bundesbank
signalled that credit policy would remain tight, writes James Blitz.
Until yesterday, there had been strong speculation that the Bundesbank would
ease official rates this week, because of easier operations the German money
market. The expectation was dampened by yesterday's monthly report from the
Bundesbank.
The December Euromark contract fell 12 basis points on publication of the
Bundesbank report, closing at 91.64, and the December French franc contract
fell 13 basis point to close at 90.35.
In London, discount house traders said that the Bank of England emphasised
in its money market operations that there will be no near-term cut in UK
base rates.
On Tuesday, the Bank turned down cheaper offers for shorter dated bills,
buying small denominations of bills at established rates. Yesterday, they
may have underlined that policy was on hold by offering a repurchase
agreement that expires on 9 November. One discount house dealer felt that
the Bank was signalling 'no change' by asking dealers to tie up funds over
26 days at the established rate of 8 15/16 per cent.
However, some dealers felt that the government could be forced into a base
rate cut by growing pressures in the real economy. Official figures showed
yesterday that Britain's overall industrial output slid 0.3 per cent in
August after a 1 per cent rise in July.
The predominance of that view was reflected in an unchanged close for
3-month money, at a rounded 8 5/8 per cent, and only a 2 basis point drop in
the December short sterling contract to 91.88. However, the overnight rate
shot up to 20 per cent because of large shortages among commercial banks.
The daily shortage was Pounds 1.6bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 50m in the
'repo,' followed by Pounds 2m of Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 4m of Band 1
bank bills and Pounds 15m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent, and
another Pounds 157m in the 'repo.' In the afternoon, the Bank purchased
Pounds 3m of Band 1 Treasury bills, Pounds 571m of Band 1 bank bills and
Pounds 22m of Band 2 bank bills, providing Pounds 485m of late assistance.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (6): Partners put safety
first - The Siemens-Framatome venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE big vendors of nuclear power equipment will tell anyone prepared to
listen that they remain confident about the long-term future of nuclear
energy as an important source of electricity generation.
Despite the present difficult market conditions virtually worldwide,
suppliers are still spending heavily to stay in the race, and thus prove -
eventually - that their beliefs are not merely empty rhetoric.
But designing a new generation of nuclear power plant has always been a
long-term affair, and with so few business opportunities, it is becoming
increasingly necessary for suppliers to plan ahead in co-operation with each
other.
That was the background to Siemens of Germany and Framatome of France
collaborating in 1989 in the field of pressurised water reactors (PWRs)
through the creation of their joint subsidiary Nuclear Power International
(NPI).
Three years later, the project is nearing the end of an important first
phase that has already illustrated the immense challenges of designing a new
generation of PWRs, but has also shown the benefits of European co-operation
in a market where a handful of players are determined to last out the
present rough patch.
By linking two leading reactor suppliers in Europe, the venture would have
been important for the industry even if it had remained limited to its
original terms - the marketing of PWR units based on the existing technology
of the two parent companies and the joint development of the next generation
of PWR units for export.
But, says Dr Bruno Baumgartl, NPI's managing director, both Siemens and
Framatome realised that the new PWR could not be designed without feedback
from the German and French utilities which operated PWRs, or without
co-operation from both licensing authorities.
Yet Electricite de France had already started a long-term programme, REP
2000/N4+, for a new generation of PWRs, while several German utilities had
signed an agreement with Siemens in 1989 jointly to define a concept for
future PWR units. This was known as the Planungsauftrag.
It was clear, therefore, that having three development programmes was a
potentially huge waste of resources, and after a series of discussions in
1991 it was agreed to merge the available results from the two national
programmes with the NPI development programme.
What has emerged, therefore, looks much more logical: a joint development
programme called EPR - European Pressurized Water Reactor - which in France
will be the successor of the N4 series, in Germany will replace the Konvoi
design, and elsewhere will be NPI's reference for export.
The design concept is an essentially evolutionary development from the
reactors built by Framatome and Siemens in the past, and, says Dr Baumgartl,
there is not much that can be done to improve on the performance of these
plants in terms of output.
A nuclear power plant has to be competitive in comparison to possible
fossil-fuelled plants, which is only possible with a capacity greater than
1,000MW. And with 1,400MW nuclear units now being operated with success in
the European grid, there was no reason to return to a smaller size. So NPI
is basing its concepts on a power output of 1,450MW, corresponding to the N4
units under construction in France.
The main focus of efforts is on safety, to help facilitate public acceptance
of nuclear power and thus the commercial prospects for the EPR. NPI is
working on a two-fold strategy, of which the first is to improve the
preventive level of the traditional 'defence in depth' approach as compared
to existing products.
The target is to reduce the chance of a core melt - the worst thing that can
happen to a nuclear power station - to less than one in 1m per year for
internal events, while no 'family of events' should be more than 10 per cent
of this figure.
'This is the conventional way to make improvements,' says Dr Baumgartl. 'But
it would not be sufficient to improve the acceptability of nuclear power in
the public mind.' The second part of the strategy, therefore, is to assume
the worst case scenario and mitigate its effects so that radioactive
releases can be limited to the plant or nearby.
This emphasis, naturally, focuses attention on the reactor building design
and safety systems, as with any nuclear power plant. But it also points to
the importance for NPI of co-operating with German and French licensing
authorities to achieve common standards.
NPI is now presenting proposals to authorities in both countries to achieve
a harmonisation of safety rules. Although it cannot be said that one
country's rules are generally tougher than the other's, there are different
means to achieve the same goals, says Dr Baumgartl.
The harmonisation challenge is one reason for the project's extended
timescale. The first phase of the project, determining a 'joint
technological concept', should be completed by the end of this year or the
first quarter of next year. A second phase of work to establish a basic
design phase will begin in April, and will be paid for by the utilities.
Construction licence applications could then be made to authorities in both
countries in 1995, with construction beginning in 1998.
Dr Baumgartl's hope is that, by then, sentiment towards nuclear power will
have changed in NPI's favour. Although forecasting is difficult, he says
some nuclear plants will have to be replaced in France, while the debate in
Germany about the greenhouse effect could work in the nuclear industry's
favour.
The two home markets will be important for NPI. 'For a new product, or one
developed from previous products, it is necessary to have domestic orders so
that it can be sold abroad,' says Dr Baumgartl - making the decision to
merge the three PWR projects all the more sensible commercially.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (7): Chernobyl's shadow looms
/ A look at safety in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE world nuclear industry can look at the former Soviet Union and eastern
Europe in two entirely different ways.
The region could be a source of much-needed orders to bring its 58
Soviet-designed reactors up to western standards of safety and efficiency -
and perhaps even to build entirely new plants in countries that are
particularly short of generating capacity. Upgrading nuclear plants
throughout the region would cost Dollars 10bn to Dollars 20bn.
Or, if the worst happens and there is another nuclear accident as serious as
the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, its impact on public opinion would be serious
enough to destroy any prospect of a renaissance in the industry for another
decade.
Most attention has focused on 25 reactors which western experts believe to
be particularly hazardous: 15 Chernobyl-type RBMKs (water-cooled
graphite-moderated reactors) in Russia, Ukraine and Lithuania; and 10
VVER-230s (old pressurised water reactors) in Russia, Bulgaria and
Czechoslovakia.
The G7 summit meeting in Munich last July considered setting up a Dollars
800m multilateral fund to carry out the most urgent safety work. But the
seven leaders failed to agree on the proposal (largely because the US and
Japan preferred to make their own bilateral arrangements for nuclear
assistance). Instead they passed the problem to the 24 OECD countries, known
for this purpose as Group of 24.
When officials and nuclear experts from the G24 met in Brussels last month
to co-ordinate plans, they heard that firm commitments to safety assistance
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union amounted to little more than
Dollars 300m, mostly from the EC. Provisional pledges of aid could take the
total to around Dollars 700m.
The only significant western-funded safety work undertaken so far has been
at Kozloduy in Bulgaria, which was described last year as the most dangerous
nuclear plant in the world. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) had discovered not only basic design defects - for example,
the lack of an emergency cooling system and containment to enclose the
reactors in an accident - but also a management and workforce too
incompetent and demoralised to run the station safely. Even the basic
operating manuals and plant drawings had been lost - or perhaps removed by a
departing Russian adviser.
Kozloduy is less dangerous today. Twenty nuclear specialists from western
Europe have been working there for the past year, under the auspices of the
World Association of Nuclear Operators (Wano), to improve the plant's
management and operating procedures.
Virtually no assistance has yet reached the other nuclear plants of eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, after two years of discussion and
countless visits by assorted western organisations - nuclear utilities,
consultancies, equipment manufacturers and regulatory bodies - all looking
for commercial opportunities and often working at cross purposes.
Not surprisingly, the operators of Soviet-designed reactors are exasperated
by the lack of real help after all the talk, as the heads of the Russian and
Ukrainian nuclear utilities made plain on a joint visit to London last
month. They said that, whether or not western assistance was forthcoming,
they would continue to run their nuclear plants - and do what they could to
make them safer from their own resources.
'If western governments will stop just talking and will give real
assistance, then we will not reject that help, because it will enable us to
solve the safety matters more quickly,' said Mr Erik Pozdyshev, president of
the Russian nuclear utility Rosatomenergo. 'But if the help is always
delayed, we have the capacity to provide the necessary level of safety for
our nuclear stations ourselves.'
In the short run, the region is so short of electricity that all available
plants will have to run close to full capacity during the coming winter.
These include the two surviving reactors at Chernobyl itself, which the
Ukrainian parliament has said must be closed permanently by the end of next
year.
Rosatomenergo plans to keep the 11 RBMK reactors in Russia running well into
the next century, after upgrading their safety systems. The Sosnovy Bor
plant near St Petersburg - where a radiation leak caused widespread alarm
last March - will operate at least until 2003. At the same time Russia will
open new PWR-type VVER reactors, starting with a 1,000MW unit at Balakovo
which is virtually completed and due to start operating next year.
As a result of Chernobyl, public opinion is more hostile to nuclear power in
the Ukraine and the country has a moratorium on commissioning new nuclear
plants. But Mr Vladimir Fuks, chairman of the Ukrainian utility
Ukratomenergoprom, is keen to complete three new VVER reactors which are in
the final stages of construction at Zaporozhe, Rovno and Khmelnits. He
forecast that parliament would vote next year to commission them if this
winter is cold enough to bring severe energy shortages.
Meanwhile, Russian nuclear engineers - still proud of their achievements in
spite of western criticism - are determined to carry on developing new
reactors for the next century.
Work on fast (breeder) reactors continues, though at a much slower pace than
before the break-up of the Soviet Union, and some believe that their
salvation could be a collaboration on fast reactor development between
Russia and Japan.
The R &amp; D Institute for Power Engineering in Moscow favours a fast reactor
cooled by molten lead (instead of the molten sodium favoured in the west)
which its scientists say could be developed within 12 years.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Survey of The Nuclear Industry (1): Anxieties spoil the
birthday celebrations / Investigation into the fightback and the intensive
research into fusion power - the hope for the future
</HEADLINE>

Fifty years after the first controlled nuclear chain reaction on a Chicago
squash court, the industry is facing up to the erosion of public confidence
as a result of the Three Mile Island accident in 1979, the Chernobyl
disaster in 1986, and a perception that it is uncompetitively expensive. It
has also been attacked by environmental campaigners.
AS THE nuclear industry prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of its
scientific birth - the first controlled nuclear chain reaction, achieved by
Enrico Fermi and his team in Chicago on December 2, 1942 - it is facing up
to the fact that nuclear power may already have passed its peak, in terms of
its contribution to world electricity generation.
According to Nukem, the international nuclear consultancy, the peak was
probably achieved last year. In 1991, the world's 420 nuclear power reactors
supplied 2,009 Terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, a record 16.6 per cent
of the total demand.
'Nuclear's share in world power generation is expected to decline gradually
from 1992 onwards,' says Nukem. Although nuclear output will increase very
slightly over the next 15 years, it will not keep pace with the projected
growth in demand for electricity - which will therefore be met mainly by
burning more fossil fuel and from renewable energy sources.
Statistics from the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency paint a similar picture for
the 24 wealthy industrialised countries, which together account for 80 per
cent of the world's nuclear power. Their total nuclear generating capacity
is expected to rise from 264 gigawatts (GW) in 1991 to 296 GW in 2000 and
321 GW in 2010, but the industry will lose ground slowly in relation to
other sources of power.
The latest projection for the end of the century is only one quarter of the
one published in 1977, when the NEA forecast that OECD countries would have
1,200 GW of nuclear capacity in 2000.
The two crucial events undermining the growth of nuclear power were the
Three Mile Island accident in 1979 - since when no new plant has been
ordered in the US - and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986. They were the focal
points for a more general loss of public confidence in nuclear safety.
Anti-nuclear groups have played successfully upon people's fears both of a
sudden Chernobyl-type release of radiation and of the slow impact of
radioactive wastes on the environment.
At the same time, nuclear power has been struggling against the perception
that it is uncompetitively expensive. Its costs are only partly caused by
increasingly stringent safety requirements.
Another factor is that the most efficient size for a modern pressurised
water reactor (PWR) is around 1,400 MW. Such a huge plant requires a lead
time of about 10 years and an investment of Pounds 2bn to plan and build.
Utilities, especially privately-owned ones, would prefer to buy a series of
smaller gas-fired power stations which could be ordered and built within
three years - and with less risk of a public outcry.
Commercial prospects for nuclear equipment manufacturers are correspondingly
bleak. A 20-year chart of new orders worldwide, published in Nuclear
Engineering International's 1992 World Nuclear Industry Handbook, shows
demand slumping from 30-40 GW per year in the early 1970s to around 10 GW a
year in the early 80s and only 2 GW now.
Companies are subsisting on a growing volume of replacement and maintenance
work on existing reactors, while continuing to design new reactors which
they hope utilities will order during the second half of 1990s.
Even so, there are a few relatively bright spots around the world:
Asia offers the best growth prospects. Japan is on course to boost its
proportion of nuclear electricity from about 25 per cent now to 35 per cent
within 10 years. An important problem in densely populated Japan is where to
put reactors; however, a large site at Higashidori in the far north of the
main island, Honshu, has just become available, following an agreement on
compensation between the utilities and local fishing co-operatives.
Elsewhere in the region, South Korea and Taiwan are leading the nuclear
expansion movement.
In the United States, the industry's pressure group, the Council for Energy
Awareness, was able to proclaim 1991 as 'a banner year' even though there
was still no sign of any new orders, because the country's 111 plants put on
a record performance, operating at 70 per cent of capacity compared to 66
per cent in 1990.
The industry now hopes that US utilities will start to order 'new advanced
design nuclear plants' in the mid-1990s. Three US manufacturers
(Westinghouse, General Electric and ABB/Combustion Engineering) are working
on reactor designs.
In western Europe, France is the showpiece of the nuclear industry. PWRs
generate almost three-quarters of French electricity - more than anywhere
else in the world - and export surplus power to neighbouring countries.
Although a few more PWRs are now under construction or being planned by
Electricite de France, the country does not want to rely on nuclear for more
than 80 per cent of its electricity, for reasons of diversity and security
of supply. In the UK, 1994 will be a crucial year for the industry: the
country's first PWR, Sizewell B, is due for completion and the government
has promised to review the whole future of nuclear power then.
In eastern Europe, the nuclear industry has been disrupted, like all other
activities, by the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union. The region's
58 Soviet-designed reactors do not meet western safety standards - and 25 of
them need upgrading urgently - but the countries involved do not have the
billions of dollars required and the west is proving slow at providing
financial and economic assistance.
Even so, there is likely to be a long-term role for nuclear power in a
region that is very short of energy. And there may be scope for building new
plants in countries such as Hungary and Czechoslovakia, which could export
some of their electricity to western Europe.
Having had to defend itself against a constant barrage of attacks from
environmental campaigners, the international nuclear industry is becoming
increasingly aggressive in its own use of green arguments. Nuclear spokesmen
take every opportunity to point out that their plants generate none of the
pollutant gases - carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides -
associated with the main competition, fossil fuels.
But the most compelling strategic argument for maintaining nuclear power is
that it ensures a diversity of energy sources for individual countries and
for the world as a whole.
Although supplies of gas, oil and coal have been ample for the past decade -
and will remain so for many years to come, according to most forecasts -
there is always the possibility that unexpected world events could suddenly
bring serious shortages. Or scientists might find that global warming,
induced by burning fossil fuels, gathers pace more quickly than anyone had
predicted. In that case, renewable energy sources could not come to the
rescue quickly enough.
Nuclear power cannot provide a viable option for the future if the
supporting industry is allowed to wither away. Lead times are so long - a
decade for an individual nuclear plant and much more than that for a new
generation of reactors - that an active programme of manufacturing,
development and research is essential.
The most forward-looking research is into fusion power: obtaining energy
from combining light atoms rather than splitting heavy ones. The Joint
European Torus (JET) at Culham near Oxford achieved controlled fusion power
for the first time last November, and the EC, US, Japan and Russia agreed
this year to spend Dollars 1bn over the next six years designing a 1,000 MW
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor. If ITER succeeds, it will
then have to be followed by a demonstration power plant before fusion power
could become a commercial reality - some time in the middle of the next
century.
Even critics of the nuclear industry have to admit that it has long-term
vision.

by S&amp;P

<TEXT>
CANADA'S pride in being one of the world's most stable countries was shaken
yesterday by a downgrade of its foreign-currency debt by Standard and
Poor's, the New York credit-rating agency.
S&amp;P lowered its rating from Triple-A to Double-A Plus, citing a rising
current account deficit, heavy foreign debt and political uncertainty ahead
of the October 26 referendum on constitutional change.
The downgrade does not affect the federal government's borrowings in
Canadian dollars, which make up the bulk of its debt. But it does include
foreign-currency loans to the Export Development Corporation, Ottawa's
export-credit agency, and several other public corporations.
Mr Donald Mazankowski, finance minister, said S&amp;P was correct in assuming
that political uncertainty, 'if it persists, could weaken investor
confidence and hamper the conduct of economic policy.'
But others expressed surprise at the downgrade. Mr Martin Bakker, chief
financial officer of the Export Development Corp, one of Canada's most
active international borrowers, said the corporation's profits and cash-flow
before loan-loss provisions have improved in recent years.
Canadian markets have been jittery ahead of the referendum. The Canadian
dollar plunged last month, and the gap between US and Canadian interest
rates widened by more than 3 percentage points. Yesterday, the Canadian
dollar lost almost half a cent, falling below 80 US cents.
S&amp;P noted that Canada's current account deficit had risen to 4.3 per cent of
gross domestic product from an average of less than 2 per cent between 1985
and 1988. Net foreign debt is expected to rise to 148 per cent of exports
this year, up from 100 per cent in the second half of the 1980s. S&amp;P said
this was substantially higher than any Triple-A rated sovereign borrower.

KOC HOLDING, Turkey's largest manufacturing concern, is to float shares in
Bekoteknik, its brown-goods electronics subsidiary, in the latest move to
divest the company of family-owned shares.
The company said yesterday that 10 per cent of the stock of Bekoteknik's
trading operation would be sold to the public on October 19 through Koc
American Bank, the parent group's banking arm.
The stake, worth around Dollars 3m, represents the latest move by Koc to
reduce the family-owned holdings and spread the share ownership in
anticipation of a full public listing.
The company said the money would be used for new investments. Bekoteknik
recently failed in a bid for a privatised east German television producer,
which was bought by Samsung of Korea.
Exports were worth Dollars 65m in 1991, representing 27 per cent of total
sales. Bekoteknik produces brown goods under license from Toshiba and
Hitachi of Japan as well as its own brand name, and accounts for around 20
per cent of Turkey's exports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Guintoli, the French construction company, were suspended
yesterday following reports that the company is being investigated by the
Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the stock market watchdog,
because of its alleged involvement in the Ciments Francais scandal.
The French business newspaper Les Echos yesterday said the COB was
investigating whether Ciments Francais - whose chairman, Mr Pierre Conso,
was dismissed last week after the discovery of huge losses from off-balance
sheet dealings - formed a concert party with another company, Cogequin, to
buy shares in Guintoli.
Guintoli, specialising in railway and motorway projects, is 32.9 per cent
controlled by Ciments Francais. Les Echos reported that Cogequin, a company
based at Ciments Francais' Paris headquarters, earlier this year bought a
9.15 per cent stake in Guintoli.
Under French law, any company, or companies acting in concert, must make a
formal offer for a company if they own more than 33.33 per cent of its
shares. If Ciments Francais and Cogequin did form a concert party they may
have acted illegally in not mounting a formal bid.
The COB yesterday declined to comment pending the publication of a formal
statement. Ciments Francais has also said it has nothing further to disclose
until its new audit is completed and its board meets at the end of this
month.
Guintoli's shares were suspended at FFr720. Ciments Francais' shares, which
fell sharply last week after the disclosure of the off-balance sheet losses
estimated at between FFr400m and FFr500m, (Dollars 80m-Dollars 100m) have
been suspended since last Friday when the COB began an investigation into
its financial affairs.
The controversy could also have implications for Paribas, the French
investment bank, which earlier this year agreed terms to sell control of
Ciments Francais to Italcementi, the Italian cement group. Paribas, which
still holds a 34 per cent stake in Ciments Francais, is in negotiations with
Italcementi and its adviser, Mediobanca, over the question of compensation.

FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: Black Thursday for troubled
Finnish banks - Losses across the sector could be as high as Dollars 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH as many as five of the banks in Finland's troubled financial sector due
to report their eight-month results, it is little wonder that today has
already been christened 'Black Thursday' by Finnish news-papers.
The fact that so many banks are announcing together is as unprecedented as
the size of the losses they are likely to reveal. Nor is it any coincidence
that the announcements are being made together - several of the banks have
planned to release their figures earlier, and have postponed them for fear
of being first with the bad news.
There is no doubt that the figures will be dreadful. 'The losses will be
huge,' says Mr Jari Eklund, analyst with KOP Investment Research. 'Even the
best bank is in a bad situation,' he explains.
One estimate is that losses across the banking sector will be as high as
FM10bn (Dollars 2.15bn) this year - double last year's level - prompting
suggestions that the government may have to re-emphasise its determination
to support the sector.
The performance of Finland's two leading banks, Kansallis-Osake-Pankki (KOP)
and Unitas, the holding company for the Union Bank of Finland, will be the
main focus of interest.
But a broader picture of the scale of the crisis will emerge from the
results of Skopbank, which had to rescued by the Bank of Finland last year,
STS and Okobank. Of the five, Skopbank is expected to announce the biggest
losses, and only Okobank is thought to have any chance of reporting a
profit.
The banks' problems stem directly from Finland's economic difficulties, and
in particular are being caused by credit losses and narrow margins.
The situation has deteriorated steadily throughout the year, exacerbated by
Finland's high real interest rate levels and an increasing number of
bankruptcies, and there is no indication yet that the worst is over.
Non-performing loans continue to rise.
The government has already provided a FM28bn support package for the sector,
comprising FM8bn in preference capital and a FM20bn guarantee fund.
This may be enough to get the banks through this year, and even next, but
many believe it will not be enough. 'The final figure could be twice that
amount,' according to Mr Eklund.
All the main banks, apart from Unitas, have already applied for a preference
capital injection from the government and Unitas is thought likely to do so
before the year end.
In the current austere environment, it is difficult to see where relief is
going to come from.
Interest rates are coming down slowly, but they need to fall much further
before customers are enticed back and margins improve.
There is considerable tension between the banks, which want lower interest
rates, and the Bank of Finland, which wants a tight monetary policy to
enhance the country's credibility before the markka's exchange rate is fixed
again.
Mr Vesa Vainio, chief executive of Unitas, says that for the banks'
situation to improve there need to be changes in the broader business
environment. He rejects suggestions that the main cause of the problems is
the easy lending that took place in the 1980s.
'The problems now are high interest rates and lack of demand from our
customers. We have to get new decisions which will change the business
environment. It's a must,' he states.
The banks are doing what they can by way of rationalisation and staff cuts
to enhance profitability. KOP, for example, plans to cut 10 per cent of its
staff this year. Unitas will have reduced its staff to 8,500 by the end of
the year, 2,000 fewer than in 1987.
This is just one aspect of a broader restructuring, through mergers and
branch closures, which is thought to be inevitable in what many consider to
be an over-banked country. This is one reason why there was some surprise
when Unitas pulled out of talks to buy Skopbank from the government's
guarantee fund earlier this week.
The worry for the government is not just the persistent air of crisis in the
banking sector, but its impact on the budget deficit and the additional pain
which will be inflicted on the Finnish population by a new package of cuts.
Comparisons are made by Finnish bankers between their difficulties and the
crisis in Norwegian banking. But there is one big difference: the Finns do
not have income from an oil industry to bail them out. In Finland, the
taxpayer will end up footing the bill.

back in black this year, report says

NORWAY'S savings banks will return to profits this year and remain in the
black until the end of 1995, following two years of losses, the Savings
Banks Association said yesterday. The 130 banks, however, will see zero
growth in loan volume in 1992 and 1993, largely due to competition from
heavily-subsidised commercial banks.
The association says the savings banks will post a combined net profit of
NKr620m (Dollars 103.33m) this year compared with a loss of NKr1.827bn in
1991 - their worst during the last five years - and a loss of NKr1.082bn in
1990.
Combined profits will rise further to NKr1.280bn in 1993, NKr1.430bn in 1994
and NKr1.915bn in 1995, it adds.
Last year, the state injected an estimated NKr18bn into the banking sector,
but the savings banks received just NKr2.5bn.
The association argues the commercial banks, because of state subsidies, can
offer more competitive terms than the non-subsidised savings banks.
Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank last year collapsed into the hands of the
state which has since remained their owner. Christiania has warned it needs
a further state injection of NKr2.05bn and Fokus Bank has said it needs
NKr650m in order to meet new capital adequacy regulations.
The association said the government should end free subsidisation of the
commercial banks.
Sparebanken Nord-Norge, the third-largest savings bank, bounced back into
the black in the first eight months of this year with a pre-tax profit of
NKr112.1m compared with a loss of NKr41.3m in the same period last year.
Credit losses were cut to NKr188.1m from NKr359.7m, and costs slashed to
NKr463.7m from NKr700.6m.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gartmore seeks Pounds 20m for country funds
trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
GARTMORE is attempting to raise Pounds 20m for a new investment trust, which
will invest in single country funds in emerging markets, such as Latin
America and south Asia, writes Philip Coggan.
Although there are other investment trusts specialising in emerging markets,
this is the first to concentrate on the country funds sector.
There are around 160 emerging country funds worldwide, of which 53 have
listings in London. Many of these funds stand at a substantial discount to
their asset values and because of this Gartmore does not believe that shares
in the new Emerging County Funds Trust will themselves be plagued by a
discount.
However, the managers have introduced two features to try to restrict the
discount; warrants are being offered with the ordinary on a one-for-five
basis, and shareholders will have the right to vote on the winding up of the
trust, if the shares and warrants trade at a discount of over 5 per cent for
12 consecutive months.
Gartmore is trying to place a minimum of 20m shares at 100p each.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: N Brown beats Pounds 7m aided by core
growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
N BROWN, the mail order company which specialises in clothing for older
women, yesterday announced a 23 per cent profits rise due to growth in both
core and new business.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 6.03m to Pounds 7.44m in the six
months to August 29. Turnover was 14 per cent up at Pounds 79.6m (Pounds
69.5m), helped by Pounds 3.79m of sales from Odhams, the video and compact
disc order company acquired from the receiver last November.
Operating profits increased only 2.4 per cent to Pounds 9.4m. They were held
back by spending to improve customer service and low operating margins at
Odhams of 3 per cent, against 13.1 per cent for Brown's established
business.
Mr Jim Martin, chief executive, said Brown's emphasis on selling to older
women offered protection from the recession. Orders had increased strongly
since August, although the situation had worsened following sterling's
withdrawal from the ERM.
Interest costs declined to Pounds 1.81m (Pounds 2.28m) helped by the
proceeds of last year's Pounds 16.4m placing and open offer. Income from
listed investments, mainly referring to a stake in Coats Viyella, increased
to Pounds 107,000 (Pounds 93,000). Brown's small financial and property arm
incurred an operating loss of Pounds 33,000.
As part of the focus on customer service, products are being brought into
Brown's warehouse earlier, reducing delays between orders and delivery.
However, this lead to a 14 per cent increase in stocks on a like-for-like
basis to Pounds 27.3m.
Net borrowings in the period increased to Pounds 32.8m (Pounds 31.7m). But
gearing fell from 56 per cent to 49 per cent due to a 12 per cent increase
in shareholders' funds to Pounds 67.1m.
Earnings rose 14 per cent to 6.84p (5.99p). The interim dividend is lifted
to 1.95p (1.75p).
COMMENT
Brown and its products may be short on glamour, but the company has solid
support in the stock market, which respects its defensive nature and ability
to grow profits from a niche market. Its emphasis on improving customer
service may constrain growth this year but should begin to pay dividends
next year. Customer queries, which have fallen 18 per cent in a year due to
an improved billing system, should continue to drop along with the
proportion of goods returned. Meanwhile, Odhams' full-year contribution
should top Pounds 400,000 and provide a useful side line. Despite
yesterday's 7p rise in the shares to 288p, Brown's price has been fairly
flat following a 41 per cent increase last year. Full-year forecasts of
Pounds 18m put the shares on 17 times earnings, which is below the sector
average, suggesting that they can go a little higher yet.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fight to establish minority role - The
battle for boardroom control at Andrews Sykes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTCOME of the bitter battle for boardroom control of Andrews Sykes will
be decided tomorrow at an extraordinary meeting called at the request of Mr
Jacques Murray, the dissident shareholder who controls a 29.2 per cent stake
in the specialist industrial services group.
From the outset the six week-long battle has been as much an argument about
minority shareholder power and boardroom votes, as it has been about the
financial performance of the group.
It has pitted Mr Murray, 72, an Anglo-French investor, against a team led by
Mr David Hubbard, Powell Duffryn's 56-year-old chairman and former Peat
Marwick accountant. Mr Hubbard took over as Andrews Sykes' non-executive
chairman last autumn when the group's former chairman retired.
At the time Mr Hubbard's appointment was seen as an important step in
maintaining shareholder confidence. This was needed because earlier that
year it had sacked its acquisitive young chief executive, Mr Andrew Fitton,
seen its profits and share price fall sharply, and changed its name from
Braithwaite.
Mr Murray, who is also chairman and majority shareholder of Nu-Swift, the
fire protection, office cleaning and property company, acquired his initial
stake in Braithwate during 1990.
Since then Mr Murray has had a number of discussions with Andrews Sykes'
board about what role he and his associates might play in the company.
Nevertheless, after voting in favour of Mr Hubbard's reappointment at the
group's annual meeting at the end of July, the relationship apparently
turned sour.
Early last month European Fire Protection and Midland Bank Overseas
Nominees, Mr Murray's investment vehicles, requisitioned the extraordinary
meeting to consider resolutions removing Mr Hubbard and Mr David Crowe, one
of the two other non-executive directors, from Andrews Sykes' five-man
board, and replacing them with Mr Murray and three of his associates.
In a series of letters to shareholders the two sides have since set out
their arguments. Mr Murray's central theme has been that Andrews Sykes has
'repeatedly failed to meet profit expectations' and to realise 'the
considerable synergy benefits' that were forecast in May 1988 when
Braithwaite acquired SPP.
In particular he has cited the 81.6 per cent drop in pre-tax profits between
1989 and 1992, and the decline in earnings from 27.6p to 1.2p per share over
the same period.
In response Mr Hubbard has urged shareholders to reject what has been
characterised as 'a back-door attempt' by a minority shareholder to gain
control of Andrews Sykes. He has emphasised that the current board has a
majority of independent directors.
Mr Hubbard says the company 'has made significant progress,' despite the
background of 'severe economic pressures.' In particular he cites the almost
20 per cent reduction in bank borrowings in the latest financial year,
significant reductions in operating expenses and employee numbers, and the
rationalisation and modernisation of its depots.
At the same time he has challenged Mr Murray's motives, highlighted his
adversary's financial performance at Nu-Swift, and raised questions over
some aspects of Nu-Swift's accounting procedures and its own dealings with
minority shareholders.
Despite this public debate the battle may well have already been decided in
the series of meetings both sides have held behind closed doors with
institutional investors.
Two of those institutions, Royal Insurance Asset Management, which holds an
8.19 per cent stake, and Postel Investment Management, which has a 4.71 per
cent stake, have said they will back Mr Hubbard and the board.
Royal Insurance in particular appears to have stung the Murray camp with its
comment that 'the growing trend for overseas investors to seek control of
quoted UK companies through a minority shareholding should be vigorously
resisted.'
One of Mr Murray's associates noted that 'it has turned into a political
rather than a commercial discussion.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hotelier loath to check out - The career of
Lord Forte, retiring chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Lord Forte still going strong a month before his 84th birthday, it is
no surprise that his retirement as chairman does not end his links with the
company which he started as a milk bar some 60 years' ago and turned into
Britain's biggest hotel group.
During a business career spanning six decades, Lord Forte made his enemies.
The merger between Forte and Trust Houses in 1970 turned into an acrimonious
affair.
The ill-feeling generated by Lord Forte's biting criticism of the Savoy
Group during the 1980s has not disappeared. The Forte group's critics say it
is too inward-looking and too focused on the UK.
Yet only the most jaundiced foe would deny that Lord Forte is Britain's
greatest-ever hotelier.
He will become president, replacing Lord Thorneycroft, former chairman of
the Conservative Party. Unlike Lord Thorneycroft, Lord Forte will be a
member of the board.
Mr Rocco Forte, his 47-year-old son, who has been chief executive since
1983, will now add the post of chairman.
To the disappointment of many in the City, Forte has not brought in an
outsider as either executive chairman or chief executive. Although it has
appointed two respected non-executive directors in the form of Sir Anthony
Tennant, retiring chairman of Guinness, and Sir Paul Girolami, chairman of
Glaxo.
Mr Forte says he will continue to consult his father, arguing that it would
be foolish not to take advantage of his experience. He said pretty much the
same when Lord Forte was chairman, which makes it possible that little will
change.
Two strong non-executives might make their mark, but family solidarity is a
constant theme of the Forte story.
In his autobiography, published in 1986, Lord Forte recounts that in the
late 1870s, a relative in Italy was kidnapped by a band of brigands. The
ransom note, addressed to the family in their mountain village of Monforte,
between Rome and Naples, was unambiguous: 'If you don't pay, we cut off your
son's ear. The second time we ask, we cut off his nose.'
There was no question about what the family should do. They sold everything
they possessed to raise the money - their jewellery, sheep and horses. They
even mortgaged their land. Many emigrated in the search for work to pay off
their debts.
When Lord Forte started his milk bar, his sceptical father thought he was
taking too much of a risk - and put up Pounds 1,000 in cash.
Born in Monforte in 1908, Lord Forte arrived in Scotland with his mother at
the age of five, joining his father, Rocco, who had set up a small business
consisting of cafes, ice cream and food shops.
Lord Forte has described himself as Scottish-Italian, but added that he
appreciated Dr Johnson's dictum that the noblest prospect which a Scot ever
sees is the high road that leads to England.
His own business career, first in family establishments and then in his own
milk bar, was rudely interrupted in 1940 when his Italian citizenship led to
him being interned for three months on the Isle of Man. Loyal to his adopted
Britain and a convinced anti-fascist, internment hurt him deeply.
The experience forms the most poignant chapter in his book. On its own, it
would have been sufficient to lift it above the bland, self-serving mass of
business autobiographies. But, while not short of self-congratulation and
many digs at enemies past and present, the account of his life was too
quirky not to be enjoyed.
Recalling his love for his mother, he mentions her excellent Christmas
turkey stuffing - and then reproduces the recipe over three-quarters of a
page.
Acquiring British citizenship six months after the war ended, the then Mr
Forte became caterer to many of the UK's landmark events. He won the
catering contract for the Festival of Britain in 1951.
In 1955, his company was awarded the first catering concession at London's
Heathrow Airport. When the M1, Britain's first motorway, opened in 1959,
Forte became the first operator of a motorway service area, at Newport
Pagnell, Buckinghamshire.
Forte bought its first hotel, the Waldorf in London, in 1958. The company
merged with Trust Houses in 1970 and acquired the American-owned Travelodge
International company in 1973. Last year the company dropped the Trusthouse
part of its name, reverting to just Forte.
The size and prestige of the company are undeniable, as are its excellent
relations with investors, who have awarded its shares a consistently high
rating. But there is general acceptance that the company needs a bigger
international business. Many think it needs to become more entrepreneurial.
It would be difficult for anyone to succeed Lord Forte, particularly when he
still holds a position in the group, no matter how symbolic.
His son says that the difference now is that he, rather than his father, is
accountable to the shareholders. But whether he is chairman or president,
the founder will be hard to ignore.

FT  15 OCT 92 / GM's revolution turns into a race against time: The US
carmaker's move to turn around operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News that Mr Robert Stempel, the 59-year-old chairman of General Motors, has
been admitted to hospital after suddenly falling ill, introduces a further
element of uncertainty to the group's plans for changes in its loss-making
North American car operations.
Ten months after he announced plans to cut 74,000 jobs and close 21 parts
and assembly plants by the middle of the decade, Mr Stempel's revolution has
won some early skirmishes. But the hardest battles are just beginning, and
rumours suggest that powerful non-executive members of GM's board may be
restive that change is not coming more quickly.
Two huge question marks remain over the company's future:
Can GM cut costs as fast as it needs in the face of opposition from the
United Auto Workers union and the group's own entrenched bureaucracy?
Can it produce the kind of vehicles Americans want to buy, to halt the slide
in its US car market share from 46 per cent in 1980 to 33 per cent last
month ?
Mr Stempel was reportedly due to be released from hospital this morning
after a blood pressure problem was corrected. Prolonged ill-health could
complicate GM's efforts to turn around its core North American vehicle
business, which made an operating loss last year of Dollars 5.3bn (Pounds
3.1bn) and is on course for a Dollars 2.4bn loss this year, says Mr David
Healy, an analyst with SG Warburg.
A persistent loss in North America will eventually undermine profits made by
GM's European car operations and its financial services, aerospace and data
processing subsidiaries. It may already be cramping its budget for the
development of new cars. 'It has the potential for absolutely catastrophic
long-term harm to the company, from a financial standpoint,' says Mr David
Cole, director of the University of Michigan's Office for the Study of
Automotive Transportation.
Protected initially by its sheer size, GM was slower than Ford and Chrysler
to react to the assault mounted by Japanese manufacturers in the 1980s.
Figures published last week by Harbour &amp; Associates, a car industry
consultancy, estimate GM employs 4.55 workers to assemble one vehicle,
compared with 3.01 at Ford and 3.76 at Chrysler.
It was the US recession, plunging GM into the red, that finally forced
management into a revolution which has now passed through four distinct
stages.
Stage one, between December and April, laid the groundwork for change with
announcements of proposed plant closures and an organisational shake-up
which scrapped GM's three division structure in North America and replaced
it with a single umbrella organisation.
In stage two, the revolution did what revolutions often do: it devoured its
own. The GM board, unhappy over the speed and style of change, ousted Mr
Lloyd Reuss, the company president hand-picked by Mr Stempel to oversee
North America, and replaced him with Mr Jack Smith, head of international
operations.
Mr Smith made his mark in the 1980s as head of its European operations,
which he turned from severe losses into one of the world's most profitable
car businesses.
He has brought extra drive to the restructuring, especially through his
appointment of Mr J. Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, a Spaniard who shook up
GM's parts suppliers in Europe, to perform the same job in North America.
The previously decentralised purchasing system has been placed entirely
under his command.
Mr Lopez has had an immediate impact on Detroit, telling GM's suppliers that
if they want to retain its business they must compete with the best in the
world - on quality and cost - and in some cases lower their prices by 20 per
cent or more. In return, GM is prepared to offer them long-term contracts
and assistance.
Many supply companies are furious; others are more sanguine, looking forward
to a closer involvement in developing new vehicles, and to the overseas
sales opportunities offered by GM's new global sourcing policy.
Mr Lopez's most dramatic impact may have been inside GM itself. The company
gets 70 per cent of its parts from its own subsidiaries (extremely high
compared with rivals), which employ UAW members. These too are being told to
shape up or lose business.
GM has also begun selling off some parts operations - it recently put its
ball bearing business up for auction - and some analysts believe far more
dramatic disposals could be in the pipeline.
Mr Lopez's actions have also helped usher in the fourth and most fraught
stage of the revolution - a potential confrontation with the UAW, which has
recently staged two strikes at local parts plants over job losses.
The union, already angry over the 21 plant closures, fears many more jobs
will go if the company buys more parts from outside suppliers. It is also
furious over the company's alleged 'whipsawing' - playing off plants
threatened with closure against one another to win concessions on labour
practices.
The strikes are seen as a counter shot to deter GM from drastic job cuts and
soften the company up before 1993's negotiations on a new three-year labour
pact. Yet this week Mr Stephen Yokich, a senior UAW official, said the union
recognised GM had real problems and was 'quite prepared to be part of . . .
solutions'.
The potential confrontation with the UAW contrasts with an improvement in
recent years in day-to-day management-labour relations at many GM plants,
where greater worker involvement in decision-making has been an element of a
drive to improve vehicle quality.
In spite of big strides in narrowing the quality gap with Japanese rivals,
GM has not yet been able to translate this into market share gains. The
company lacks contenders in buoyant sectors such as sports utility vehicles,
mini-vans and mid-sized saloons. There is also a 1980s legacy of dull,
look-alike cars and GM's most faithful buyers tend to be relatively old and
are gradually dying off. 'The challenge for GM is to make products which
appeal to the baby-boom generation,' says Mr Christopher Cedergren of the
Autopacific consultancy.
GM can sometimes do this: its luxury Cadillac Seville is a big hit and its
compact Saturn car, manufactured with state-of-the-art techniques, is so
popular it is in short supply.
GM has some formidable strengths: financial clout, strong European
operations, a vast US dealer network and great depth in technology. The
revolution, then, has a lot of factors working in its favour. But time is
not one of them, success is far from certain, and the next 12 months look
particularly perilous.

FT  15 OCT 92 / RBS to keep Charterhouse stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Scotland is likely to retain a minority stake in Charterhouse,
the City of London merchant bank which it is in the process of selling.
Negotiations on selling Charterhouse to a consortium of European banks are
at an advanced stage, though no formal announcement is likely for five or
six weeks.
The leading members of the consortium are BHF, the German commercial bank,
and Credit Commercial de France, the French banking group.
Apart from the stake to be retained by RBS, other shares in Charterhouse are
likely to be placed with investment institutions if the deal goes through.
Charterhouse would gain access to the bank consortium's customers throughout
the continent and the UK. However bankers warned yesterday that completion
of the deal was by no means certain.
RBS, which is being advised by SG Warburg, the merchant bank, is adamant
that it will not sell Charterhouse unless the 'price is right', according to
a banker. It wants a premium to Charterhouse's net assets, which were Pounds
176.8m in September 1991.
If agreement on a sale is not reached by the end of the year, RBS will cease
attempts to sell Charterhouse, according to a senior banker.
RBS would then follow National Westminster Bank's example by combining its
merchant bank and commercial banking operations - reversing a policy of
keeping the merchant bank autonomous.
Charterhouse's executives, led by Mr Victor Blank, chairman, would however
fight to retain independence. They point out that their autonomy has allowed
them to be consistently profitable.
RBS already has close links with both BHF and CCF. BHF and RBS are members
of Inter-Alpha, an association of European banks which serves as a forum for
the discussion of mutual problems.
CCF is a member of RBS's electronic banking network, Ibos. Ibos allows its
members to link their branches electronically, giving their customers access
to a European-wide network. The CCF connection to Ibos goes live next month.
RBS's board decided to sell Charterhouse nine months ago, after pressure
from Mr Blank.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Medeva announces decision to leave generic drugs market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA yesterday announced that it is withdrawing from distribution of most
of its basic generic products; the lossmaking business that has hindered the
growing pharmaceuticals group.
Medeva is taking a significant loss on yesterday's Pounds 23.5m disposal. It
is selling its generics stock for Pounds 11.5m to Norton Healthcare, a
subsidiary of Ivax Corp of the US. It will receive Pounds 12m for a 29-acre
site in Horsham, Sussex, and Medeva's manufacturing operation and leasehold
premises at Bradford. The disposed businesses had a turnover of about
Dollars 53m (Pounds 30.8m), according to Ivax.
It also said that it is to issue 16m new Medeva shares - representing an 8
per cent increase in capital - to buy Armstrong Pharmaceuticals, a US
developer and manufacturer of therapeutic drugs delivered through
metered-dose inhalers.
The purchase values Armstrong at about Dollars 54m. Mr David Lees, finance
director, said the acquisition would dilute 1993 earnings unless US Food and
Drug Administration approvals were obtained for Albuterol, a generic
equivalent of Glaxo's Ventolin, which is used for the control of asthma.
The sale of almost all of its generics business ends Medeva's costly blunder
of entering the competitive generics market.
When Evans Healthcare was acquired by Medeva in January 1990 for Pounds 87m,
more than half of Evans' Pounds 43.7m turnover consisted of generics. Later
that year, Medeva immersed itself further in generics by acquiring Thomas
Kerfoot for Pounds 20m, although only Pounds 10m was paid because of the
business's poor performance.
Ivax's acquisition follows a series of deals by the US company to expand its
marketing network and product range in Europe. In April, it spent Pounds 22m
acquiring Waverley Pharmaceutical, a privately-owned UK contract
manufacturing company. It follows the Dollars 73.4m acquisition two years
ago of Harris Pharmaceuticals, a British generics manufacturer.

FT  15 OCT 92 / SE acts on small company shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London Stock Exchange yesterday announced its latest attempt to
encourage a more active market in smaller company shares, as a third big
market-maker announced a partial withdrawal from the area.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew followed Warburg Securities and County NatWest as it
announced it was to stop making markets in 200 securities and was making 15
people redundant. It will continue to quote prices in 800 shares, remaining
one of the biggest market-makers in London.
The UBS decision will add 40 companies to the list of 159 which do not have
two market-makers in their shares, and so cannot be traded under normal
Stock Exchange rules.
The exchange yesterday, announced new trading rules for these companies
which closely echo the specialist system on the New York Stock Exchange.
That new market, to be known as the Stock Exchange Alternative Trading
System (Seats), will involve the appointment of a single market-maker in
each of the illiquid stocks. They will operate alongside an order-driven
system known as the Bulletin Board, an electronic notice board on which
investors can advertise shares they want to buy or sell.
The combination of the two methods of trading, with a new rule forcing
off-market business to be brought to the central market place, is intended
to concentrate trading in these shares.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Spare the public spending axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The UK male unemployment percentage to be announced today is likely to
exceed the peak reached in the 1980s. Nor is there any sign of a let-up.
The plain man may think it madness to cut spending on needed road, rail and
other infrastructure improvements, or to dismiss public employees at a time
like this. The plain man would be largely right. This will all be done so
that the Treasury can say that its Planning Total of Pounds 244.5bn for
1993-94 has not been breached. The published total will be less than that
because of a definitional shift to a new spending aggregate known as the
Control Total, which will exclude recession-sensitive social security
payments.
Keynes pointed out in the 1920s the absurdity of unmet wants and unemployed
workers side by side. But if we are to make use of the obvious insights of
Keynes, we have to remember what went wrong with the way of thinking which
bears his name.
1. Above all there was the neglect of inflation. Governments can only
sensibly maintain spending in money terms. If they try to spend themselves
into full employment, irrespective of the effect on pay and prices, they
will only let loose accelerating inflation without creating any sustainable
jobs.
How big a short-term inflationary setback has been inflicted by Black
Wednesday is highly debatable. Whatever the magnitude, it means so much more
inflation and so much less output and jobs, given a coherent policy to
maintain the growth of total spending ('nominal GDP') at a sustainable rate
of, say, 5 per cent a year - an aim which ought to be common ground, even
though it was not mentioned in the chancellor's letter to the Treasury
committee. Public spending programmes, expressed in cash, can be a
legitimate part of policies to maintain non-inflationary demand growth, even
though they will be less successful outside the ERM.
2. The next argument is the anti-fine-tuning one. Public works commissioned
in a recession are likely to boost demand pressures in the next boom. This
argument had its greatest force during the four or five-year cycles
characteristic of the period up to the 1970s. Measuring from trough to
trough, the latest cycle has so far lasted 11 years and could last longer.
With longer cycles characterised by periods of consumer over-indebtedness
and reluctance to spend, it makes eminent sense for public expenditure to
make up the private gap.
3. The most valid argument for keeping a close watch on public spending at
all times is the ratchet effect. The public spending ratio rises in a
recession and under Labour governments, but is slow to fall afterwards. This
would make me, other things being equal, prefer tax cuts to public spending
boosts. But we cannot ignore the fact that taxpayers are in a saving mood,
or that tax cuts would be unacceptable in the prevalent hair-shirt mood.
4. The most high-brow argument for public spending curbs is the debt trap
one. Beyond a certain point more and more government borrowing is required
simply to pay the interest on previous borrowing until financial solvency is
threatened, as in Italy. This is an argument for a nearly balanced budget,
in years of normal business, not for curbing spending at the wrong time.
The wrong way to avoid the debt trap is to raise taxes in a recession. The
insidious long- term effect is to raise the revenue base and reinforce the
ratchet toward ever higher public spending. It is astonishing that the 1981
budget, which did just that, should be eulogised by Thatcherites who claim
to be against big government. It is also astonishing that people who claim
to be monetarists should depend on fiscal policy, of all things, to check
inflation.
Many of my readers will be waiting to hear more of the distinction between
capital and current government spending: 'Up to a point, Lord Copper.'
For the profitability test is either absent or much less clear in public
sector investment. I come back to my old example that expenditure on school
lavatories counts as capital expenditure, while expenditure on more science
teachers counts as current.
Despite all these difficulties, there is a case for a capital budget, if
only to sell a borrowing programme to the financial markets and persuade
people who live by symbols that the government is not on a rake's progress.
Updating the Treasury's own estimate of the capital element in total public
expenditure gives one some Pounds 35bn to Pounds 40bn in 1993-94, about the
same size as the likely borrowing requirement.
To my mind, however, the more important distinction is not between current
and capital expenditure, but between expenditure that puts people and
capital equipment to work and that which is dissipated in pay and price
increases.
The biggest scope for radical action is in the 30 per cent of public
spending devoted to pay and the 23 per cent to the direct purchase of goods
and services. It is reasonable to ask public-sector employees to accept a
freeze on average pay per head, so that more of them can be kept in
employment. It is reasonable to impose a price ceiling on bought-in supplies
and contracts. This is not a call for an incomes policy but a call to manage
the public sector in terms of cash and with an eye to employment.
The strongest defence the Treasury can make is that it is not really
squeezing public spending, but attempting to keep aggregate spending plans
to original intentions, which provided for a real increase of 4 per cent.
I would reply that circumstances are sufficiently exceptional to allow
departments to continue with programmes previously cleared by the Treasury
even if the cumulative total is too high. Moreover, the recession allowance
in the new Control Total is a very narrowly defined one, and excludes, for
instance, effects on the ability of the private sector to contribute to
infrastructure projects.
Behind it all, ministers are hung up on the Treasury belief that curbing
public borrowing will allow interest rates to fall. This may well be
mythical - like the black cat in the dark room. Interest rates are largely
determined by international movements and exchange rate expectations. The
Treasury does not have the ability to deliver the interest rate reductions
that Tory backbenchers stridently demand; and no purpose is served by
pretending that they can be by spending curbs which merely put people out of
work.

</HEADLINE>

   From I JACOB

<TEXT>
Sir, I was dismayed to read that the British Council's funding is at risk
('Funds threat to British Council', October 7).
Widespread use of the English language is the one real long-term competitive
advantage, not just for British industry and commerce but also for British
art and culture that Britain has on the world stage. It would be
short-sighted to risk that advantage for any short-term gain.
I would hope that Sir Martin Jacomb, a merchant banker of repute, is able to
persuade the Foreign Office and Treasury number crunchers to share a
banker's vision of Britain's long-term investment needs.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Letter: Coal - a private industry alternative to closure and
pointing finger of blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr IAN RUTLEDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was extremely angered by your editorial on the coal mine closures.
Your assertion that the finger of blame points 'most obviously at the NUM
and its leader, Arthur Scargill' would be treated with contempt in our part
of Britain. South Yorkshire and north Derbyshire are to lose nine out of 10
of their collieries, and I can assure you the man in the street is pointing
his finger not at Arthur Scargill but at John Major.
Those with more knowledge of the energy scene are also pointing their
fingers at the privatised electricity industry and its regulator, Professor
Littlechild, whose incompetence will result in more expensive gas-fired
electricity replacing coal-fired power.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Letter: Coal - a private industry alternative to closure and
pointing finger of blame
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr WILLIAM HEARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Much of Britain's remaining coal mining industry, it has been announced
('Anger erupts at coal pit closures', October 14), is to be closed with the
shut-down of 30 of the remaining 50 pits, the loss of 30,000 mining jobs
and, presumably, many more mining-dependent jobs in areas close to those
pits.
At any time such an announcement would serve as a chilling reminder of the
seriousness of the decline of Britain's basic industries but today it also
raises important questions about the proper role of government (Conservative
or otherwise) in industry and the policies which really underly the current
plans for the further privatisation of British industry.
If British Coal cannot run 50 pits at a profit with the energy requirements
of a population of 57m in the UK, could one or two of our leading industrial
groups be asked if they would like to try before the pits are closed and the
near irreversible process of geological collapse begins?
The president of the board of trade has announced his willingness to
intervene in British industry before breakfast, lunch, tea and dinner. Could
he choose one of those occasions this week to call Lord Hanson and find out
whether Hanson would like to acquire any of the mines scheduled for closure.
Lord Hanson and his colleagues appear to have done a fair job in getting to
grips with the large Peabody coal mines in the US. Why not let them try in
the UK? Should any such bidder be interested, presumably the price could be
set at a nominal Pounds 1, coupled with some enforceable undertakings about
employment numbers.
I am sure the Union of Democratic Miners would be interested in discussing
any such plans - possibly with some no-strike profit sharing deal.
Perhaps the fear is that mines acquired in this way 'on the cheap' would
provide unfair competition for the rump of British Coal and so spoil the
government's plans to privatise that too.
Let the president do his job, create some real competition in the energy
industry and in the process perhaps just save some much needed jobs.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Letter: Sympathetic stance pledged on exercise of new VAT
rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir BRIAN UNWIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I make two points on the article by Charles Batchelor (Management:
The Growing Business) and your related editorial, 'VAT headache', (October
13) about the VAT changes being introduced as a result of the Single
European Market.
First, although the Single Market will remove a massive amount of paperwork
and bureaucracy at the frontiers, the new VAT and other arrangements will
represent a big change for businesses.
This is why we have invested heavily in consulting companies and providing
them with information, and we are very anxious to continue to do so. Our
regular publication, Single Market Report, is issued to 70,000 companies and
we have organised or attended numerous seminars with businesses.
In addition, most companies which will be required to provide detailed
returns have already been visited by our local VAT staff to explain the new
arrangements to them. All of them will be seen well before the end of the
year.
My staff in our local offices have also been working closely with local
Chambers of Commerce, and similar organisations for over a year to get these
messages across. We wish to help British businesses prepare for 1993 as much
as we possibly can. If any of your readers feel that their business is
likely to be affected and has not so far been approached, I urge them to
contact their local VAT office as a matter of urgency. Each of our regions
has a trained single market liaison officer who will be glad to advise.
Second, I should like to stress that we shall take an understanding view of
problems and mistakes on returns in the early stages of the new regimes. As
the paymaster-general said during the debate on the Finance Bill in June,
'in considering whether to impose any . . . penalty, Customs and Excise will
take a sympathetic view of sincere errors made as a result of
misunderstanding the new provisions for the first year of this operation'. I
confirm that emphatically.

Who are the UK's most lavish boozers? The lads and lasses of Lancashire and
neighbourhood, according to today's survey of living-costs from the Reward
consultancy.
Whatever their social niche, the folk of north-west England spend more on
drink than their counterparts in any other region. Second come the Scots,
with London commuters only a short measure behind them.
Mainland eyebrows, however, will no doubt be raised by the finding that the
lowest spenders are the denizens of Northern Ireland.
The explanation could of course be that they somehow manage to consume more
booze for less money. On the other hand, Reward's researchers might have
paid undue heed to the Ulster blarney, or the finding may be just an
opt(hic)al illusion.

It would seem that Anita Roddick is rewarding Body Shop's overseas employees
for their selling skills - which have kept the UK company above the
tide-mark - by issuing them with a free T-shirt.
In a departure from her usual exhortations to take care of the environment,
the T-shirts now being distributed to workers in Body Shops in the US carry
the message Don't Let the Future Happen Without You - Register to Vote.
A similar theme is being pushed in Canada, where a national-unity referendum
takes place in ten days' time.
Body Shop has been careful not to take sides. But can there be any doubt
that Roddick would support environmentally-friendly Bill Clinton and Al Gore
if she were a US citizen?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, has thrown down the
gauntlet on subsidiarity.
Vexed by MEPs' calls for an off-the-cuff explanation of Brussels' position
on the ill-defined principle that EC decisions should be taken at the lowest
appropriate level, Delors told yesterday's special session of the European
Parliament that a concise summary was impossible.
What was more, he said, the Commission would be happy to offer employment
and a Ecu 200,000 salary to anyone who could produce a one-page explanation
of how subsidiarity might work. The 'secret' subsidiarity paper produced by
Delors' own aides runs to 23 pages.
One MEP who has already risen to Delors' tongue-in-cheek challenge is
British Conservative Edward McMillan-Scott. He has already produced a
summary of the Maastricht treaty changes on two sides of a postcard - with
room to spare for his photograph - and was last night trying to reduce it to
competition size.
Delors has not suggested who might be the judge of such a contest; if he
were inundated with entries, perhaps the concept of subsidiarity might be
brought into play.

When the first results of the 1991 census came out last year Scots were
aghast to find that the population north of the border had slipped below the
psychologically important 5m.
At 4,957,289 it was the lowest since 1931, and well below the official
estimate of 5.1m. Trying to reassure an anxious populace, Charles Glennie,
the registrar general (of Scotland), urged people to wait for the final
results.
Sadly, however, though the final figure released yesterday is 41,000 heads
better than the first one, it is still 1,433 short of the magic 5m mark.
Glennie has certainly pulled out all the stops to round up the stragglers.
Glennie recommends that for most purposes people should use his estimates
rather than the census; he still estimates that the mid-1991 population was
5.1m. But will hostile English MPs, let alone the Treasury, both anxious to
find excuses for reducing Scotland's share of public expenditure, believe
him?

FT  15 OCT 92 / Observer: Family affairs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of Rocco Forte taking over from his illustrious father as the
executive chairman of the Forte hotel chain raises once again the question
of whether it is worth backing anything other than the first generation of a
dynasty.
Despite the democratisation of British industry, there are still quite a few
big companies where the family representation is often bigger than the
residual family shareholding. Merchant banking is an obvious family business
and the continuation of the family streak at the top of Barclays Bank has
lasted for a surprisingly long time.
Then, there are companies like GEC and Hanson where some big investors are
nervous that Simon Weinstock and Robert Hanson may leapfrog their peers when
the time comes to find a replacement for their fathers.
However, it is easy to get carried away with the idea that family dynasties
are a bad thing. A cursory glance at companies where families still play an
active role shows that for every dud company there are just as many
successes.
In retailing, for instance, the stories of several generations of
Sainsburys, Sieffs, Wolfsons and Morrisons far outweigh unfortunate sagas
such as the Ratners. When families fail to deliver the goods they don't last
long.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Time to get tough on pay
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK ECONOMY is in a critical state, as the depressing stream of
bankruptcies and corporate redundancies demonstrates. The government is
already under severe pressure to cut interest rates and the pressure will
grow over the coming months. Yet the government's critics in industry and
the trade unions seem oblivious to their own failure. It is their persistent
unwillingness to adjust pay settlements to economic reality that risks
turning a difficult situation into a disaster.
Carping from Britain's industrialists and their representatives at the
Confederation of British Industry and the Engineering Employers Federation,
is a normal feature of recessionary Britain. They demand lower interest
rates, tax relief, public sector pay restraint: saving British industry is
always someone else's job.
But the dismal failure of British industry to bring wage inflation under
control, even after two years of recession, gives these gripes a hollow
ring. The government's target of an underlying inflation rate of 2 per cent
requires average earnings growth of 3 per cent. Wages are still rising at
twice that rate.
Comparison with Germany forces home the extent of industry's inertia. Since
the recession began, average earnings have grown by 13.5 per cent in Britain
and 13 per cent in western Germany. Unit labour costs in manufacturing have
also risen faster in the UK. The difference is that the western German
labour market has delivered a fall in unemployment of 16,000. British
unemployment has risen by 1.2m.
The labour market does not seem to work in Britain. A decade of trade union
reform has not altered the fact that British industrialists prefer to lay
off workers rather than reduce wage growth, while expecting the government
to stoke up inflation to accommodate these settlements.
Inflationary psychology
Membership of the European exchange rate mechanism offered hope of a change
to this inflationary psychology. Pay settlements in excess of 2 per cent
meant lost competitiveness as UK companies well knew, even if they failed to
act upon it. Outside the ERM, there is little to stop industry from
returning to the bad old days. A 15 per cent devaluation offers industry a
great opportunity to become competitive. The temptation for employers will
be to fritter these gains away in higher wages, just as they have always
done, in the belief that the Treasury will eventually validate these pay
settlements through lower interest rates and higher inflation. The pain of
the unemployed will once more have been in vain.
The UK has an economy-wide pay problem. It requires economy-wide action. The
government will rightly pale at the mention of statutory or tax-based
incomes policies. But if they are to be avoided, and its inflation targets
are to be more than mere words, then the government must act to reduce
inflationary expectations.
Pay differentials
A pay policy which applies only to the public sector, as the government is
currently considering, would be useless. Simply freezing public sector wage
increases, while leaving the private sector alone, would open wide the pay
differentials between public and private, storing up the same problems of
recruitment and retention that public sector pay review bodies were set up
to solve.
The government must do more than urge private industry into delivering the
kind of wage adjustment it has so far been unable to deliver unaided. It
should declare that the economy can only tolerate pay settlements of 2 per
cent. The endorsement of the CBI and the TUC for this view should be
demanded. Pay review bodies, and any other indexation bodies in the public
sector, should be instructed that a 2 per cent wage increase is the maximum
which should be allowed in the coming year, unless serious recruitment
problems can be demonstrated.
The Treasury should make a 4 per cent rate of average earnings growth a
precondition for any substantial easing of monetary policy. If settlements
rise, then interest rate should rise too. Individual businesses and unions
would, of course, be free to ignore these strictures. But they could not do
so in ignorance of the consequences. If British business prefers inflation
to recovery, then so be it. But they could no longer claim that they were
not warned.

FT  15 OCT 92 / A struggle to stay the distance: Economic and political
pressures could undermine the French government's austerity programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The French government's momentary panic last month about the value of the
franc has turned into longer-term depression about the fate of the economy.
Fuelling the ruling Socialists' anxiety is the near-certainty, on present
trends, that they will be buried in a landslide victory by the centre-right
in next March's legislative elections. But to give in to the electoral
temptation of relaxing economic austerity would bring swift retribution on
the foreign exchanges. This, in turn, might endanger the minority government
in parliament, and advance the very elections it dreads.
Certainly, most of the warning lights on the economic console have now gone
from amber to red. The burden of carrying virtually the highest real
interest rates in Europe - 7 per cent or more - has crushed the life out of
retail sales, construction and investment, and has brought growth in the
overall economy to a standstill.
The country's pilots make few public concessions to the fact that the ship
has run aground. President Francois Mitterrand has devoted his convalescence
since his September 17 prostate cancer operation to preparing for his
appearance at tomorrow's EC summit in Birmingham. His imperturbable prime
minister, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, remains clearly wedded to the policy of the
franc fort he espoused as finance minister. His successor, Mr Michel Sapin,
concedes the current lifelessness of new investment, but complains that this
does not reflect the real condition of the economy.
Other Socialists do not share Mr Beregovoy's Micawber-like hope that
something may turn up in the next five months to save them from electoral
disaster. Some have bailed out: Mr Michel Charasse, after presenting a 1993
budget based on unrealistically rosy economic assumptions, abandoned his
post as budget minister to join the Senate. Mr Michel Rocard, the likely
Socialist contender to succeed Mr Mitterrand, is openly pessimistic about
next spring's elections, while many junior ministers recently flocked to the
launch of a political organisation by Mr Jacques Delors, the European
Commission president, for 'socialist renewal' in France.
Outside the Socialist camp, too, some conservative politicians and
businessmen - particularly in the hard-pressed construction and hotel
sectors - are beginning to question the wisdom of continued austerity. The
consensus that France has no choice but to keep the franc hooked to the
D-Mark and wait for the Bundesbank to lower its rates is starting to break
up, as slowdown threatens to turn into slump.
The latter is most evident in the construction sector. Housing starts fell
17 per cent in the first seven months of this year on the same period in
1991. One property company now offers a free car to anyone brave or foolish
enough to take on record real mortgage rates and buy a new house. According
to one estimate, French banks have FFr400bn-FFr500bn (Pounds 47bn-Pounds
59bn) tied up in property, through their own holdings and mortgage loans,
and their profits are now tumbling as they make bigger provisions for
depreciation and bad debts.
The government is rather more sympathetic to other victims of the gap
between inflation, brought down to an annual rate of 2.6 per cent in
September, and the cost of borrowing, as set by the Banque de France's base
rate of 9.85 per cent. It has stepped in to provide some cheaper investment
funds for small companies, out of an awareness that these businesses provide
the best hope of bringing down an unemployment rate that remains stuck above
10 per cent. But this year's list of small business failures is still likely
to be 11 per cent higher than the 55,000 which went bankrupt in 1991.
The upshot of all this has been to reduce growth sharply, with expansion of
the gross domestic product falling from 1 per cent in the first quarter to a
mere 0.1 per cent in the second quarter. What impetus there has recently
been in the French economy has come from exports; but France's competitive
edge will be dulled, at least for a time, by the franc's appreciation
against the pound, lira and peseta.
The government is predicting growth of 2.1 per cent this year and 2.6 per
cent next, but most professional forecasters in France estimate the economy
will expand at most by 1.7 per cent in 1992 and by 2 per cent in 1993. As a
result, few take seriously the government's estimate that it can contain
next year's budget deficit to FFr165bn.
The chief difficulty for the leaders of the main opposition parties, the
neo-Gaullist RPR and centre-right UDF, is that they have, as yet, no
distinctive alternative economic programme to put to the electorate. They
plan to censure the government's 1993 budget, but will almost certainly fail
for lack of parliamentary support from the Communists, who do not want to
precipitate the legislative elections. Mr Edouard Balladur, the former
conservative finance minister who is tipped to lead a centre-right
government next spring, blasts the Socialists for failing to cut spending,
debt and taxes enough. But, apart from accelerating privatisation and using
the proceeds to reduce public debt, he has little different to propose. Even
while striving to be partisan, Mr Balladur is forced to admit the
Socialists' achievement in mastering inflation and redressing France's
foreign trade balance.
Employers' leaders remain convinced of the merits of an exchange rate that
has exerted downward pressure on their wage costs. 'We understand, but we
don't agree with, those businessmen who say: 'Please give us a bit of
reflation',' says Mr Ernest-Antoine Seilliere, vice-president for economic
policy at the Patronat employers' association. If the government gave in to
siren voices for change, says Mr Seilliere, all that would happen is that
'after a brief illusory reflation of consumption, a brief period of lower
export prices, a brief period of lower interest rates, we would after a few
months have to raise interest rates again'. The achievements of years 'could
all be reversed in one day'.
But this Patronat position, Mr Seilliere warns, is 'not eternal'. It depends
crucially on the Germans lowering their interest rates in the
not-too-distant future.
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, the Banque de France governor, yesterday sought to
convince his countrymen of the existence of light at the tunnel's end.
Long-term French interest rates had come down, he said, and he predicted
that an easing of interest rates in Germany was not far off.
What remains of the broad consensus on economic and monetary policy may fall
victim to election fever, which is fast setting in. The legislative
elections to the National Assembly are, of course, not the only target in
French politicians' sights. There is also the presidency. Mr Mitterrand's
illness, compounded by his unpopularity, have given rise to a general
feeling that somehow he will not, or ought not, serve out his full second
term to 1995. Mr Mitterrand himself fuelled such speculation last year when
he suggested putting a constitutional limit on the presidential tenure.
Seeking to quell this speculation, Mr Mitterrand let it be known earlier
this month that he prefers a single, non-renewable, seven-year term. His
choice of seven years, rather than, say, five years, dashed opposition hopes
that Mr Mitterrand might apply the reform to himself by quitting the Elysee
next spring, five years after his re-election in 1988.
But the opposition parties are still arguing about whether, if they win in
March, they should 'cohabit' again in government with President Mitterrand,
or somehow try - perhaps by a government-inspired constitutional reform - to
force him out of the Elysee.
All this political uncertainty has been compounded by the Maastricht
referendum. A big Yes majority might have changed the political landscape,
with the Socialists recovering and wooing pro-EC centrists into the sort of
large social democratic party that exists in many other European countries,
or the RPR and UDF sinking their historic differences over Europe. Instead,
the narrowness of the referendum verdict unsettled the existing parties and
gave a fillip to dissidents within them. Maastricht opponents such as Mr
Philippe Seguin in the neo-Gaullist RPR party and Mr Jean-Pierre Chevenement
in the Socialist party, may have lost the referendum. But their arguments in
favour of a more flexible exchange rate policy, for instance, may be
remembered in coming months.
Mr Chevenement wants to re-forge the Socialists into a 'hard left' party if
they are badly beaten. He may succeed. The Socialists are not scoring much
more in the current opinion polls than the pathetic 18.3 per cent of the
vote they won in last spring's regional elections, while the combined
RPR/UDF score runs between 43 and 46 per cent. Some Socialists privately
agree with the psephologists' predictions that they may lose half their
present tally of 253 seats. Ever since ditching the Communists in the
mid-1980s, the Socialists have been looking for allies. They failed to
strike an electoral pact with the Greens earlier this year. But now, with
the reappointment of the renegade UDF member, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, to the
Socialist government as agriculture minister, the Socialists are casting
towards the centre.
They can count on internecine warfare among their opponents. The UDF and RPR
are trying to thrash out a common platform for the March elections, but they
still disagree over European policy.
Aggravating tensions between the two parties is their leaders' rivalry for
the presidency, now given keener edge by the possibility of Mr Mitterrand's
early departure. After some 20 years at the head of their respective
parties, Mr Jacques Chirac of the RPR and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing of the
UDF probably ought to be making way to younger, less shop-worn successors.
Not a bit of it. Both seem to have emerged from the Maastricht campaign, in
which they supported the treaty but never shared a platform, re-invigorated
for the fray.
This was most obvious in the case of Mr Giscard d'Estaing, who put his heart
and soul into pleading for a Yes. But Mr Chirac seems to have done himself
presidential good by pleading the treaty's cause against majority sentiment
in the RPR. 'Chirac did badly in presidential run-offs because he always
seemed to be the prisoner of his party,' says Professor Olivier Duhamel, a
leading political scientist. 'After the Maastricht campaign, that no longer
seems so true.'
France thus looks set for a prolonged bout of debilitating election fever,
which could sap cross-party support for economic austerity just as high
interest rates are threatening to drain life out of the economy.

DANCING WITH DOGMA Britain under Thatcherism By Ian Gilmour Simon &amp;
Schuster, Pounds 16.99, 328 pages
This is a book addressed to the Tory party. In it Lord Gilmour argues that
Lady (then Mrs) Thatcher hijacked the true Conservative tradition; that
Thatcherism was wrong in principle, unpleasant in implementation and
disastrous in outcome; and that more than Mrs Thatcher's departure is needed
for the party to become once again true to its principles and an agent of
good government in its widest sense.
First, Gilmour - a Cabinet minister until he was sacked by Mrs Thatcher in
1981 - argues that the economy was seriously mismanaged. He is caustic on
the crudity of the early monetary dogmas and their spectacular failures in
practice. But many - even some who were enthusiastic at the time - now
accept this. More important is his demonstration of how little in the way of
an economic miracle we have actually had. During Mrs Thatcher's tenure of
office, the economy and investment are seen to have grown considerably more
slowly than in preceding decades, while unemployment and the balance of
payments were much worse.
Second, Gilmour presents Mrs Thatcher's social policies as regressive,
divisive and immoral: 'The treatment of the poor was unforgivable.' Not only
did the gap between rich and poor widen during the Thatcher years, but the
income of the poorest 10 per cent actually fell in real terms. Gilmour is
scathing about the sustained attack on child benefits and on the contrast
between the subsidy of Pounds 5.5bn to the middle classes in the form of
mortgage tax relief and a subsidy of less than a tenth of that to council
tenants. Housing benefits for those on low incomes were cut nine times.
Gilmour's third attack, which he sees as having underpinned the other two,
is that through dogmatic ideology and force of personality, brooking no
argument and tolerating no dissent, Mrs Thatcher destroyed or enfeebled all
institutions or individuals that stood in the way of the aggregation of
power at No 10. 'I must prevail,' as ex-colleagues have reported her as
saying when decisions were made.
For Gilmour, as for Disraeli (and many other Tory politicians and
theorists), one of the main aims of a Conservative government should be 'the
maintenance of the institutions of the country'. He chronicles a long list,
with many entertaining and horrifying examples, of Mrs Thatcher's often
successful attempts to emasculate them, including the cabinet, parliament,
the Church, the media, the universities and especially local authorities.
Gilmour presents a powerful, well-documented case, well-written though
occasionally too splenetic for its own good. But if it was all as awful as
this, how did Mrs Thatcher survive and thrive for so long? One reason is the
electoral system. She never got more than 47 per cent of votes cast and
there is some evidence that the country as a whole moved leftwards during
her terms.
A second is that there was another side to the case. Her foreign policy,
though uneven, scored some notable successes to which Gilmour pays tribute
in an interesting chapter. Much more important, however, were the famous
domestic victories over the enemies of enterprise.
Gilmour mentions all of these, but somewhat grudgingly. He does not properly
convey the extent of the frustration and demoralisation at the end of the
Callaghan administration - the absurdly high levels of taxation; the
irresponsible use of power by many unions and local authorities; the awful
way in which many nationalised industries were run; and the serious degree
of under-management in the big public expenditure programmes where the
relationship between decisions and their costs was often minimal.
No wonder that a highly visible and in many respects successful attack on
these things was welcomed and supported long after it became clear that
other muddles, inequities and tyrannies were appearing in its wake.
But there is a third reason. For most of the 1980s, most people felt much
better off. The UK imported much more than it exported. Much lower taxation
for the better-off and massive borrowing meant that most people could live
beyond their (and the nation's) means. The proportion of GNP taken by
consumption rose by 7 percentage points, an enormous and unprecedented shift
away from savings and investment.
Not exactly the economics of Grantham, though enjoyable while it lasted. Now
the party is over. We are in deep and seemingly endless recession. Will Mrs
Thatcher's successor reject Thatcherism, as Gilmour wishes, and return to a
more traditional conservatism?
The omens are not good. John Major certainly began by attaching himself to a
dogma - commitment to the ERM - that Mrs Thatcher didn't believe in. But he
attached himself with a single-minded fervour that would have done her
credit. And now that it too has collapsed, the retention of a single
economic objective, with a collection of things to be taken into account to
achieve it, looks more like the scrapings from the bottom of the old policy
barrel than an attempt to see the country's problems as a whole and enlist
help from all quarters in solving them.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING EPITOMISED Mr Shin Kanemaru's political life so much as his leaving
of it yesterday. Behind closed doors, surrounded by factional henchmen, the
godfather of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic party resigned his
parliamentary seat in response to public anger over his involvement in the
country's latest political bribery scandal.
That this is a significant development is not in doubt. For years Mr
Kanemaru has been by far the most important powerbroker in the LDP's most
powerful faction, responsible for prime ministerial appointments (including
that of the current incumbent, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa) as well as substantial
policy directions. His departure will, in the short term at least,
destabilise the party, as would-be inheritors squabble over his mantle. Just
possibly, it will also mark the beginning of action by Japan's political
leadership to reform itself and in the long term make the Japanese political
system more transparent, less expensive and so less prey to corruption.
Western critics should be wary of taking too high a moral stance over this
affair. Japan is not alone in having corrupt politicians, and its system has
produced manifest success. The LDP has presided over more than three decades
of stability, peace and economic growth, a record which parties in the US
and Europe can only envy. Other countries have arguably suffered more than
Japan from pork-barrel politics. One of the reasons US public finances are
in a mess is because parochial American politicians protect cherished local
spending programmes. The LDP, by contrast, oversaw a fiscal consolidation in
the past decade and thus enabled the government to announce an emergency
programme of Y10,700bn (Pounds 45bn) to stimulate the economy.
Factional politics
Moreover, in the wake of the collapse of communism, politics in the west is
taking on some Japanese characteristics. It is becoming less ideological,
more managerial and in parties such as the British Conservatives, who have
been in power for more than a decade, more factional.
Nevertheless the latest scandal, in which Mr Kanemaru has admitted taking
Y500m in illegal contributions from the Sagawa Kyubin company, raises
troubling questions. Not the least of them concerns transparency: who really
holds power in Japan? Is it shadowy 'kingmakers' whom foreigners rarely meet
and who owe their position more to their fund-raising abilities than their
electoral standing? And who holds power now? It does not seem to be Mr
Miyazawa, who has been left hanging in mid-air by the struggle to succeed Mr
Kanemaru, at a time when the economy is in a parlous state, Japan is in
delicate negotiations with Russia over the Kurile islands and the Gatt talks
are in the balance.
Corrupt ways
A thread of corruption runs through Japanese politics largely because of the
system of medium sized, multi-member constituencies, which means a single
party can win several seats in the same constituency. Politicians from the
same party find it difficult to differentiate themselves by ideology, so
they compensate through their munificence. They need a constant supply of
money, which mainly comes from companies who expect favours in return.
This is a system in need of change. Mr Miyazawa has promised a plan for
reform this November. For that to be more than window dressing it would need
to include measures for more open disclosure of sources of political funding
and the imposition of much tougher penalties on those who flout the law. It
should set out a timetable for replacing the multi-member constituencies
with smaller, single-member seats and redressing the imbalance between
over-represented rural areas - where the 'old ways' of Japanese politics are
still most entrenched - and under-represented towns and cities.
A government weakened by Mr Kanemaru's resignation and tainted by
controversy is not obviously in a position to deliver such sweeping reforms.
Until the political system is transformed, the disparity between Japan's
internationalising economy and a parochial political system that encourages
politicians to focus on funding their electoral machines can only grow.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Arts: A 'Voyage' to nowhere / Review of the premiere of
Philip Glass's opera at the Met, New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Voyage, Philip Glass's new opera to celebrate the Columbus qincentenary,
is a great big thing, but deeply uncertain, and uncertain most of all about
itself. The work is at least true to the mood of the celebration of a
momentous historical event which could not decide whether to remember it in
celebration or in shame.
Glass is reported as saying, with engaging candour, that he and his
librettist David Henry Hwang had to find something about Columbus that they
liked. Their ruthless solution was to cut the navigator's appearance to two
scenes, in both of which he could be portrayed alone, mapless and troubled:
at sea in the main part of the second act, and then on his deathbed at the
end of the third. Elsewhere they replaced him with heroes nearer the modern
heart's desire; a wheelchair-bound cosmologist in the prologue (hauling
Stephen Hawking into the picture is a offensive piece of opportunism), and,
for the whole first act and much of the third, a space-ship commander who is
female. The discovery (out-word) of the New World is thus defused of all
problems as it goes into the gravity-less domain of space fantasy.
The authors' excuse would seem to be that The Voyage is not really about
Columbus at all, but about the meeting of cultures (ostensibly the subject
of Hwang's play M. Butterfly) and about the restlessness of the human
spirit. Hence their decision to rendezvous with that meeting and that
restlessness in diverse dramatic situations: in the figure of Columbus, in
the mental excursions of the contemporary scientist, in the arrival on earth
of extra-terrestrials 15,000 years ago, and in the embarkation on a new,
celestial voyage into the unknown a hundred years from now, the lady
commander belonging both to the prehistoric past and to the future.
But one has to wonder whether The Voyage is properly about any of this at
all, whether the enacted scenes are not just images suitable for stage
spectacle to be going on while the music idles through vast tracts of time.
It is, most particularly, odd that a piece with this title, and with this
supposed subject matter, should undertake so little of a voyage within
itself. The score begins in E minorish rotations, and there it still is at
the end, three and a half hours later. Glass's music is now quicker in
movement, more rhythmically supple and more chromatic than it was, say, in
Einstein on the Beach, but this is not all to the good: because the
framework is still, rhythmically and tonally, in unyielding stasis and
repetition, the odd wandering detail easily sounds unmotivated and makes no
difference to the rock-like immobility. This is music that is not going
anywhere - Glass's only formal device is exchange of one texture for
another. This is music, too, whatever the scientist may sing in his words,
that makes no attempt to reach for the stars.
The opera cheers up a bit in the last act, after it has given up any claim
or wish to make sense (the long scene of Columbus's dark night of the soul
in the second act, over a shifting, revolving bass like that of Pimen's
soliloquy in Boris, was perhaps for Glass too a rite de passage). This third
act begins with a silly scene for 'Space Twins' and 'Earth Twins', the
latter accompanied by a hunchbacked bass line suggesting the Niebelung of
Das Rheingold and Siegfried. Later there is a chorus in which 21st-century
dignitaries - 'Prime Minister of the EEC', 'Executive Vice President of Coca
Cola' - are absurdly saluted. Then the commander and her three fellow crew
members lift off (luckily most of their words are inaudible), and there
remains only the inevitable after-thought of the dying luckless Columbus.
David Pountney, directing his first Met production, comes into his own when
the piece starts to go haywire, bringing on the dancing girls and a
characteristic vulgar comic energy. Otherwise the visual display is largely
a matter of dimwitted choreography and design, the latter disappointing for
the rumoured cost of Dollars 1 1/2 m: Robert Israel (sets) and Dunya
Ramicova (costumes) have done much finer work, on much smaller budgets, for
Peter Sellars. Bruce Ferden, the conductor, is creditably - and
astonishingly - enthused and disciplined. The cast (and this is probably in
the nature of the piece) is led not so much by Timothy Noble's gruff
Columbus as by Patricia Schuman's ringing, imperious Commander, with Kaaren
Erickson, Douglas Perry and Julien Robbins all excellent as her crew.
Tatiana Troyanos makes two fearsome appearances as Isabella, the
15th-century voyager's stentorian and, as it turns out, so misleading muse.

STRICTLY BALLROOM (PG) Odeon West End, Renoir, Screen on the Hill
THUNDERHEART (15) MGMs West End
SPOTSWOOD (PG) Plaza
WUTHERING HEIGHTS (U) Empire
LONDON FILM FESTIVAL National Film Theatre from Nov 5
The dance competition has been a staple of modern movie musicals ever since
Saturday Night Fever. But in Strictly Ballroom they have opened the staple
door and the horse has bolted. Urged on by first-time writer-director Baz
Luhrmann, the spirit of snorting pastiche bounds through this delightful
sequins-and-tinsel musical comedy from Australia, scattering cliches as it
goes.
Will handsome Scott (Paul Mercurio) win the Pan-Pacific Grand Prix,
Australian ballroom dancing's answer to the Olympics? If he does, will he
stay true to his and his Dad's cherished notions of artistic freedom?
(Floor-slides and pirouettes, feet-stompings and jetes). And whom will he
choose for partner - the plain Hispano-Australian girl from the wrong side
of the tracks (literally: her shanty home's backyard is inches from the
passing freight trains) or the snooty Tina Sparkle, demon queen of the
dance-room.
Strictly Ballroom was the dark horse at Cannes this year, sprinting past the
favourites and going prizeless only because it was shown out of competition.
One would call the movie camp if it seemed remotely selfconscious about its
hyperboles. But it begins as straightfaced baroque, shifts up into rococo
and ends as a roaring essay in comical-romantic glitz.
Adapting his own hit stage show, Luhrmann has deftly reconciled cinema with
theatre. The minor characters - Bill Hunter's scheming Dance Federation
boss, Barry Otto and Pat Thomson as our hero's parents - make their bow as
all-singing, all-dancing caricatures. But they are soon fished out and
individualised by close-up lenses, just as Mercurio and Miss Morice begin
generically as ill-matched lovers but soon stamp (literally, this being the
Latin branch of ballroom dancing) their heelprints on the roles.
The comic coups abound. Barry Otto as Dad executes endearingly insane
gyrations in a flashbacked glimpse of his youthful glory. (Nothing fancy
from the make-up department: the same actor topped with a Liberace-ish wig).
Morice's parents are casually revealed as Pasa Doble experts, stomping
nightly to the tune of the passing trains. And the film's finale takes every
trope of the dance-contest movie and wrings it for both comedy and a defiant
romantic elan. See and delight. Come Dancing will never seem the same again.
Would that the week could match it. Thunderheart, directed by Britain's
Michael Apted, should be subtitled Bury My Brain At Wounded Knee. It starts
as a murder thriller in an exotic setting, it ends up a stupefying slab of
political piety about America's treatment of the Indian. A killing in a
South Dakota reservation; an FBI agent sent thither who tries to disown his
own quarter-Sioux bloodline (Val Kilmer); and a Hollywood welcoming
committee of crooked white administrators, virtuous Indians and
proverb-spouting Old Chiefs.
These are variously played by Sam Shepard, Graham Greene (of Dances With
Wolves) and the picturesquely named Chief Ted Thin Elk. As we are guided to
the inevitable revelation that the local palefaces are doing the dirty on
the native Americans, I kept consulting my watch. I felt I was watching a
lecture on Indian culture interspersed with murders and bits of mysticism.
John Fusco's script alternates the banal ('This whole place is a
tinder-box') with the self-important ('I flew in here from a place called
the 20th century'), while Apted and photographer Roger Deakins keep
helicoptering over the white-ribbed mountain scenery as if a few spectacular
views will make up for the vistas of pious emptiness in the story.
The film is Robert De Niro's first producing-only venture, baptising his
Tribeca production company. The signs are not good. As with Kevin Costner,
Robert Redford, Tim Robbins and company, it seems that once you let a good
actor behind the camera he is smitten forever by right-on politics and the
desire to belabour audiences with them.
The Australian comedy Spotswood is also right-on politically but fails,
somehow, to bore us. One reason is Anthony Hopkins, here resembling a noddy
toy wired for sound. Bobbing his head and convoying his consonants, he is
the time-and-motion expert sent to drag a small-town moccasin factory into
the 20th century. The moccasin factory, conscious of jobs and handcrafting
traditions, virtuously resists. The film's second anti-boredom factor is the
script by Max Dann and Andrew Knight, which weaves enchantingly wry subplots
of love and jealousy, sex and slot-car racing from the lives of the factory
hands.
Instead of a selfconsciously healing comedy we have an unselfconsciously
Ealing comedy: small dreams and small dramas made large by the magnifying
glass of an ironic affection. Max Joffe is the first-time director: may it
be the first of many.
Wuthering Heights is likewise a first, but also virtually a last. A product
of 'Paramount British Pictures', it marks the Hollywood studio's brief
sojourn of hope in these isles. Planned as a European bridgehead, PBP soon
sank into financial uncertainty and cultural Euro-muddle.
Witness this Emily-Bronte-straddles-the-Channel offering. French actress
Juliette Binoche plays Cathy (mere et fille), nervously lobbing her English
accent at Ralph Fiennes' brooding Heathcliff, who flat-rackets it back with
staring eyes and ee-bah-gum vowels. This pair generates as much excitement
as a washed-out day at Wimbledon. But then whose fault is that in a movie
scripted by Anne Devlin as if she had picked up Cold Comfort Farm instead of
the Bronte novel, and directed by a Peter Kosminsky (former Yorkshire TV
documentarist) vacillating between irreconcilable styles.
While the moors are a plausible, pleasant wash of greens and browns and
rocky greys, Wuthering Heights itself might have strayed in from a 1960s
Edgar Allan Poe film: a crenellated carbuncle teetering over a comic-book
chasm.
No wonder moments of high romantic intensity alternate with searing bathos.
When Heathcliff strides onto the moors after his latest tantrum  - there he
stands silhouetted by two rocky pinnacles - it is but a moment before
Hareton turns up saying 'Come back and finish your dinner.' After 108
minutes of watching Emily Bronte reduced to rubble, the only fertile mystery
left is what happened to the author's own screen appearances. Miss Bronte,
says the press hand-out, is played by Sinead O'Connor and 'appears in
several scenes.' I think I spotted one. But perhaps there was more sense in
the Wuthering Heights cutting room than ever appears in Wuthering Heights
the movie.
There is always the London Film Festival, beginning three weeks hence and
booking now. The usual Noah's flood of new films - over 300 large and small
 -will move up the Thames to the National Film Theatre, spilling over into
Leicester Square for special screenings (Blade Runner - The Director's
Version, Hellraiser III, Whoopi Goldberg in Sister Act).
Elsewhere, please put your oar in the water and hope for the best. My Top
Five recommendations: Zhang Yimou's Venice prize-winning peasant fable The
Story Of Qiu Ju; Stacy Cochran's My New Gun, a black comedy about
trigger-happy suburbia, USA; Daniel Bergman's Sunday's Children, another
gleaming chunk of memory from scriptwriter father Ingmar; Jean-Claude
Lauzon's likewise autobiographical Leolo, a sort of Canadian Amarcord; and
actor John Turturro's writing-directing Mac, Best First Film winner at
Cannes and a fighting, funny tale of domestic life based - yes, once again -
on the film-maker's own family. If the 1990s prove to be the decade of
self-portraiture in the cinema, remember where you read it first.

In his later years the conductor Otto Klemperer was renowned for his slow
speeds. He also had a dry sense of humour: at one rehearsal for a piano
concerto the story goes that, after a whispered exchange between the soloist
and conductor, Klemperer turned to the orchestra and with a twinkle in his
eye proclaimed, 'You say you want it slower, Mr Barenboim?'.
His words echoed again and again at the Royal Festival Hall on Tuesday. In
his recent appearances Klaus Tennstedt has shown a fondness for slow speeds
when he is working with soloists. His recording earlier this year of
Beethoven's Violin Concerto with Kyung-Wha Chung was already deliberate
enough. But this performance nearly died on its feet and it seemed that the
evening's soloist, Nigel Kennedy, was encouraging him to hold back even
more.
There comes a point when the amount of time available is difficult to fill,
even for a talented musician. Kennedy took more risks than Chung had in the
same position, which yielded some rewarding moments, when the ideas worked.
Unfortunately the strain involved in making sense of the music and keeping
up a good quality of tone at these speeds too often told. Nor was Kennedy's
own cadenza in the finale among the better of the genre. Altogether, an
unsatisfying experience.
That special ability that Tennstedt has of letting romantic music drift off
across an ocean of inactivity was displayed again after the interval in
Brahms's First Symphony, when the music suddenly became becalmed in the
middle of the opening movement. But how expertly he uses the opportunity in
symphonic works, building the momentum back to full strength with enormous
power and conviction.
This was a splendid account of the symphony, majestic, tumultuous, every
phrase alive with feeling - the sort of performance that Giulini wanted to
give here last year but failed to deliver. Under Tennstedt the London
Philharmonic is shown to be a first-rate Brahms orchestra and it gave him
the best playing to which it has aspired in recent months. For the German
classics, at least, the South Bank has found a winning team.

Alexander Ostrovsky was a 19th century Russian playwright whose early works
were banned by the tsarist regime not because they were particularly
revolutionary, but because they satirised the bourgeoisie. He was
pre-Chekhov, but you can see the marks of Ostrovsky in Chekhov's plays,
notably a love of the theatre for its own sake and the suggestion that while
all the world's a stage, actors and artists are somehow different from other
people. The subtlety lies in showing that the division is not entirely
clear-cut.
Ostrovsky's prolific output has not been much translated into English
because, one is told, his Russian is idiomatic and his satire is local. A
tragedy made it to New York around 1900, but the comedies have come only
recently. The Royal Shakespeare Company achieved a breakthrough in 1981 with
a production of The Forest, starring Alan Howard. Artists and Admirers
followed at the Riverside Studios a year later and has now been revived by
the RSC, directed by Phyllida Lloyd. As a play, it is almost a draughtsman's
illustration of a curate's egg: some parts of it are very good.
The principal artist is Negina, a poorly-born but talented actress who is
befriended by an equally poor student and, rejecting the student, is
launched on her career by a seriously rich landowner. Both student and
landowner are admirers and both seem decent enough sort of men: the only
difference between them is that one of them has money, and the power and
influence that go with it, while the other has not. The stage-manager, once
a member of the landed gentry, is an admirer as well.
There is one other artist, a drunken tragedian who looks as if he is playing
Falstaff and King Lear at the same time and talks to Negina as if she were
Ophelia. Shakespearean references abound: Negina's initial entrance has
suggested Ophelia long before the tragedian talks about a nunnery.
The weakness is that there are one or two other characters who appear to be
neither artists nor admirers, but just hangers-on. They include a government
official, a boorish prince and the local impresario. Sometimes it is not
easy to tell them apart.
There is a question about Negina's mother. Is she an admirer or just an
old-fashioned mum? The cook, a very small part, is an artist in that she
treats the samovar as if it were human while she makes the tea, wonderfully
played by Virginia Denham.
In the end, there are too many parts for the play and no-one stands out for
long. The attempt to introduce pathos into Negina's parting with the student
does not work and much of what must once have been satire has been lost with
the passage of time.
Yet do not overlook the good bits. Denys Hawthorne has some splendid moments
as the tragedian. Linda Bassett plays the mother as well as one could
imagine: note the change in her accent when the rich landowner first
appears. One always sympathises with the straight female lead, for that is
what Negina is, in a play made for character acting. Sylvestra le Touzel, a
very good character actor herself, does all that can be done with a part
that does not develop.
Artists and Admirers, however it looked when it was first written, no longer
seems a very good play, though it remains an interesting one because it
tells us so much about Russian theatre before Chekhov. The latter would have
tidied it up a bit, dropped some characters and introduced more feeling.
Ostrovsky, incidentally, became a very popular playwright as the tsarist
regime relaxed its censorship. He was made President of the Society of
Russian Dramatists and Operatic Composers and began to work on the ensemble
style of acting which led to Stanislavski. You can see some of that in Ms
Lloyd's production and the designs by Anthony Ward.

Television cookery programmes have improved out of all recognition. True,
you do still come across the occasional man with a camp hairdo and a silly
accent standing behind a studio gas stove telling you that this is one he
made earlier, but increasingly rarely.
Setting the standard today are series such as Keith Floyd's on Spain where
the sharing of recipes is just one among a number of ambitions. A Cook's
Tour Of France with its location camerawork and interest in local traditions
and personalities has much more in common with Floyd than with the old
studio gas stove routine.
Here the hostess is Mireille Johnston who today visits Brittany (8.00 BBC2).
Given the current scarcity of good British comedies it seems odd of BBC1 to
screen Waiting For God and the repeats of One Foot In The Grave on the same
night (8.30 &amp; 10.20), especially since both are concerned with the modern
tribulations of old age.
BBC2's series about life in Britain today, Present Imperfect (9.30) looks
tonight at Steve and Dennis, travelling evangelists who use video and pop
music to appeal to their target audience: children.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Technology: Assault on food bacteria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US Department of Agriculture has approved the use of a common food
compound, trisodium phosphate, in poultry processing to reduce salmonella
contamination.
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemical group whose US subsidiary discovered the
antibacterial activity of trisodium phosphate, calls it 'a major
breakthrough for public health'.
Following yesterday's USDA approval, the company is working urgently with
the EC authorities to amend food hygiene regulations so that the process can
be introduced in Europe, where more than 1m people suffer from
salmonella-based stomach upsets every year - many caused by eating poultry.
The treatment, which Rhone-Poulenc calls AvGard, simply involves drenching
each bird in trisodium phosphate solution at the end of the slaughtering
process. Bill Swartz of Rhone-Poulenc says the total cost amounts to less
than one cent per bird. Irradiation - an alternative method of killing
bacteria - costs 5c to 20c per bird and is opposed by some consumer groups.
USDA tests showed that trisodium phosphate reduced the incidence of
salmonella and other bacteria (including E Coli) more than 100-fold in
treated birds. Rhone-Poulenc scientists do not yet know how it gets rid of
bacteria so effectively, Swartz says, though 'it may break the bond between
the salmonella and the surface of the chicken'.
Trisodium phosphate is used widely as a food ingredient, particularly for
emulsifying processed cheese. The AvGard process leaves only 'tiny traces'
of the chemical on the bird; it has no effect on the taste, texture or
colour of the treated chicken, according to tests by independent
laboratories.
AvGard illustrates Rhone-Poulenc's approach to its food ingredients
business, Swartz says. 'It is going to be very difficult to get new
ingredients approved so we need to develop new uses for existing ones.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Technology: Working in harmony - Saving time, money and
arguments is the aim of technology partnerships
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the wall of William Chatman's office at Foster Wheeler is a picture of an
apparently unremarkable petrochemical plant built for a big UK client by the
Reading-based process plant contractor.
The plant was completed on time and within budget. But it was not a happy
experience for either the client or the contractor. 'It was a good example
of a project that succeeded even though the two teams were at daggers
drawn,' says the burly chairman and chief executive at US-owned Foster
Wheeler.
Increasingly, the chemical industry is realising that the traditional,
adversarial approach to getting plants built is just as likely to produce
acrimony and lawsuits as results. It can be time-wasting, creates large
amounts of tension and diverts attention from what the joint goals of the
client and contractor should be, says Chatman.
A new type of relationship, involving 'technology partnerships' or
'preferred contractors', is now taking root in the process plant industry.
One benefit, but by no means the only one or the main one, is to remove the
'us-and-them' approach which can bedevil relations between client and
contractor.
With a large, complex, chemical plant, technical problems can lead to
protracted, and often pointless, arguments. 'With the traditional
relationship, you could have spent 10 days arguing about whose fault it was,
now the problem can be solved in 10 days,' says Brian Osborne, managing
director of Portsmouth-based John Brown Engineers &amp; Constructors.
John Brown and Foster Wheeler have been at the centre of the technology
partnership trend - which, at least in the process plant industry, began in
the US in the 1980s. In March the two companies signed a deal with ICI which
makes them the preferred contractors for all jobs worth between Pounds 1m
and Pounds 30m designed and engineered in the UK - wherever in the world the
plant is to be built.
Partnering is a well-established idea outside the process plant industry -
food retailers have been using preferred contractors for their supermarkets
for many years to save time and money by eliminating the tendering stage and
giving all or most of their work to one builder.
But process plant contracting is not only in a different league
technologically, it also involves a huge range of technologies that very few
contractors have the ability to handle in their entirety.
Often, big chemical companies such as ICI develop a process technology which
is licensed to only a few contractors capable of handling it. Alternatively,
the contractors develop their own proprietary techniques.
This makes it much harder for the chemical industry to give all its work to
a small number of contractors - the ICI deal, for example, excludes larger
contracts where a particular proprietary technology may be critical.
Even so, the increasingly competitive environment in the chemicals industry
is encouraging large companies to develop more open, long-term relationships
with the contractors to avoid wasting energy in areas where others
specialise.
Bryan Smith, ICI's director of engineering, sees the arrangements as
dovetailing the respective and different skills of client and contractor -
with ICI Engineering concentrating on technology development and 'front-end
definition work,' and the two contractors carrying out the execution of
projects.
'ICI Engineering provides an engineering service to about 20 distinct
business entities,' he says, 'and in many cases engineering has the
potential to transform the business. Our need is to transform the way we
look at our task, adding value rather than looking at the mechanics of the
project.'
Consequently, the new approach is producing cultural change at ICI, and
that, says Smith, is probably more important than the direct benefits of a
non-adversarial method for handling contracts. 'A collaborative approach has
been proven to work better,' he says. 'It's common sense that it should do,
so long as you do not get too cosy or sloppy.'
At first glance, it is the 'cosiness' or otherwise of technology
partnerships that raises eyebrows. Aren't the clients and contractors
getting a little too close for comfort?
Not so, say the three companies involved. ICI ran the equivalent of a
year-long beauty contest on about 19 contractors - an exercise which Chatman
had not seen in 40 years in the industry. The 19 were asked what
technologies they had covered. 'With our wide range, there were precious few
that covered half the spectrum,' says Smith.
This reduced the list to seven contractors, each of which was interviewed by
a team of ICI project managers for a day to a day and a half. That only
reduced the list to six, but then ICI really went to town - sending in
functional specialists to assess the contractors in 19 different categories,
and using a marking grid for the results.
ICI had originally intended to have three preferred contractors, but with
recession looming it decided it would be unfair to include a third company
which matched its needs less well, as it would not get any work.
The two winners were announced last year, leaving a handful of very
disappointed contractors. 'In at least one case they were devastated,' says
Smith. 'But when they realised the process had been done objectively, it
took some of the pain away. And most said it was the best feedback they'd
ever had.'
In a sense, the technology partnership process mirrors the trend in
manufacturing industry towards a reduced number of suppliers.
Without mutual trust and understanding, normally built up over years of
contact between client and contractor, the system will not work.
The arrangement also helps the client manage computer-based design and
procurement data in a way which is very difficult when projects are being
handled by many different contractors. ICI and the two contractors are
working jointly on linking the three computer systems into a common network
 -although John Brown and Foster Wheeler will not share information.
But the checks and balances of a client-contractor relationship still
remain. The ICI teams that carried out the original tests can check whether
the contractors can really do what they claimed, and the agreements are not
absolutely exclusive.
Ultimately, ICI could even terminate the agreement, but that would be a
'devastating' indictment of the contractor's reputation, says Smith. 'We
have every confidence in the contractors, and they've got a lot of trust in
us,' he adds.
ICI is carrying out independent benchmarking to assess the benefits of the
deal, but precedents in the US, which were the subject of a study three
years ago, suggest savings of 5 per cent on overall project costs and an
average 5 per cent reduction in project schedules.
Eliminating the tendering process for each project could save two to three
months, says Ian Robinson, chief executive of John Brown's engineering and
construction business, but the client could spend that time thinking further
about the project to ensure it is making the right investment decisions.
Overall costs should also be reduced, particularly when contractors are
working for the second or third time on a similar project. 'I am quite
convinced we will be able to tackle successfully the issue of reducing the
total installed cost of the plant,' says Robinson.
Technology partnership deals bring the contractor a solid 'baseload' of work
 -at Foster Wheeler the agreement with ICI already generates 10-15 per cent
of its business, says Chatman. The profits are not necessarily as high as on
a large, tendered contract, but in an uncertain market the partnership
arrangement has a stabilising effect on the contractor's workforce.
Both John Brown and Foster Wheeler have already won three or four big
contracts from the partnership deals, and more are in the pipeline, says
Smith. But relations have also been transformed on ongoing contracts. 'We
now have joint teams on most projects, and you can't tell who's who,' says
Smith.

What is it going to take to turn long-promised multimedia technologies into
mass market products and new sources of profit for the ailing computer and
consumer electronics industries?
The latest move to unlock demand for multimedia comes from a group of
companies that have formed a joint venture called First Cities with the goal
of bringing interactive multimedia services to homes and schools throughout
the US.
The group is led by Microelectronics and Computer Technology, a
computer-industry consortium based in Austin, Texas. Members include Apple
Computer, Eastman Kodak, Corning, North American Philips and two regional
telephone companies.
First Cities demonstrates the converging interests of consumer electronics,
computer, communications and entertainment industries that could ultimately
lead to the formation of a trillion-dollar industry, according to John
Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive.
Initially the group will study the potential markets for multimedia
services. Starting late next year, it aims to set up a demonstration of
interactive multimedia and by early 1995 to create an interactive multimedia
service available throughout the US. These might include 'movies on demand'
and access to information services via TV.
Interactive TV is seen by many as the most promising application of
multimedia technology in the consumer sector and it is being pursued in
various forms by companies including Hewlett-Packard and IBM as well as the
First Cities group.
To date, however, television information services have not been successful
in the US and it is hard to know whether adding better-quality sound and
pictures will change the trend.
'The big problem is that it is difficult to describe and explain the
benefits of multipurpose multimedia systems,' says Andrew Webber, a
consultant with Arthur D Little.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Subtle style is back
in fashion - Lanvin plans a comeback in the luxury goods market, despite the
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For months two of the swankiest stores on the very swanky rue du Faubourg
Saint-Honore in Paris have been hidden behind bright blue screens as teams
of builders have beavered inside. On Sunday the screens will be whisked away
for a lavish launch party to celebrate the reopening of Lanvin's men's and
women's wear stores.
The reopening is the first phase of the multi-million pound relaunch of
Lanvin as a leading player in the global luxury goods market. The timing is
scarcely propitious. The industry, already suffering from the US recession
and Europe's economic slowdown, now faces the additional problems of Japan's
instability and this autumn's currency crisis.
Michel Pietrini, who joined Lanvin as chairman two years ago from Chanel,
one of the most successful French fashion houses, purports to be
unperturbed. 'The market is certainly not easy at the moment, but we're here
for the long term,' he says. 'There are still opportunities for companies to
do well, providing they have the right strategy.'
Lanvin, Pietrini hopes, has defined a strategy which will become a role
model for luxury groups in the 1990s, just as Chanel did in the 1980s. The
story starts two years ago when Lanvin was bought by L'Oreal, the world's
largest cosmetics company, and Orcofi, a consortium representing the family
interests of Henry Racamier, who had just lost a bitter battle against
Bernard Arnault for control of the LVMH luxury goods group.
Lanvin was then at the nadir of its fortunes. It had flourished in the 1910s
and 1920s under Jeanne Lanvin, its founder, but had floundered after her
death. By the late 1980s, when other Paris fashion houses, notably Chanel
and Hermes, were thriving, Lanvin was struggling.
It was bought by Britain's Midland Bank which sold off assets and drafted in
Claude Montana, one of the most inventive Paris designers, to revive its
exclusive haute couture collections. But the luxury market proved more
complex and costly than Midland had expected. It sold Lanvin in 1990 to
L'Oreal and Orcofi, each with 50 per cent stakes, for more than FFr400m
(Pounds 46.9m).
Orcofi saw the Lanvin deal as a chance to add one of the oldest names in
French fashion to its portfolio of luxury products. It also offered an
opportunity for Racamier to strike back against his old foe, Bernard
Arnault, whose fashion interests include Christian Dior and Christian
Lacroix.
L'Oreal was more interested in Arpege, the perfume created by Jeanne Lanvin
in 1927, which, despite decades of neglect, is still one of the handful of
classic French fragrances. L'Oreal, already a leading player in perfume,
hopes to restore Arpege to the same status as the successful classics,
Chanel No5 and Guerlain's Shalimar, both of which generate sales of about
Pounds 50m a year and huge profits.
But before Arpege can be relaunched, L'Oreal and Orcofi need to re-establish
Lanvin on the Paris fashion scene. In recent years the management and
marketing of luxury products has been dominated by the strategy devised for
Chanel in the early 1980s by Alain Wertheimer, its reclusive owner, and
Michel Pietrini. The Chanel formula is to use the fashion collections as a
flagship for the scents, cosmetics and accessories bearing the company's
name. The collections, designed by Karl Lagerfeld, the prolific German
designer, need not necessarily make money - their role is to create the
correct aura of chic for Chanel's other products.
Chanel's strategy has been so successful that many of the other European
luxury houses - including Gucci, Pucci and Ferragamo of Italy  - have copied
it. Midland hired Montana in the hope that he would create the same frisson
for Lanvin as Lagerfeld had at Chanel. Dunhill, the British luxury group,
went one step further in the imitation stakes this summer by bringing
Lagerfeld back as chief designer of Chloe, though he still works for Chanel.
Pietrini is convinced that a new strategy is needed for the 1990s. 'The days
of ostentatious fashion are over,' he says. 'People no longer buy things
just to show off. They want quality and service.'
He sees Lanvin's fashion activities as a self-standing business, not a shop
window for the brand name. Whereas Chanel and Hermes aim their fashion only
at the very top of the market - a Chanel suit costs from Pounds 1,200 and an
Hermes Kelly bag at least Pounds 1,000 - Lanvin is directed at a broader
spectrum.
The men's shop stretches across seven floors from sports wear in the
basement to made-to-measure shoes on the top floor. It sells off-the-peg
suits from FFr4,000 and bespoke suits from FFr24,000.
There is a special lift so the made-to-measure customers can avoid hoi
polloi on the lower floors.
The style of the stores is subdued. An Anglo-French design team under Sir
Terence Conran has decked them out in blues and browns with Art Deco
details. The refined effect is strikingly different from the opulent marble
of the Gianni Versace shop across the street, or the glossy monochrome of
Chanel around the corner.
Lanvin has chosen the same subtle style for its fashion collections. Montana
was dropped as the couture designer and Dominique Morlotti hired from Dior
to design men's and women's ready-to-wear.
After Sunday's opening, Lanvin will accelerate its new strategy. Its new
ranges will be introduced to its 50 sales outlets in the Far East this
autumn. Arpege will be relaunched in Europe next spring and in North America
in 1994, when the company also plans to reintroduce its fashion collections
to the US.
Lanvin will not comment on the cost of the relaunch, which has presumably
been colossal, not least because it had to close its men's store for almost
a year and the women's store for six months. All Pietrini will say is that
the losses to date - L'Oreal disclosed a FFr60m loss on its 50 per cent
share of Lanvin in its 1991 accounts - are in line with expectations.
Pietrini is convinced that the new Lanvin is a formula for success in the
luxury goods market of the 1990s, just as Chanel was in the 1980s.
But Chanel staged its revival at a time when the economic environment was
favourable to the luxury trade. A decade later, Lanvin is being relaunched
into a much more competitive climate.
The fate of the new Lanvin will depend as much on the fluctuations of
Japanese share prices and on whether American tourists are prepared to pay
more for their weekends in Paris, as on Pietrini's new strategy.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Money's no object
when you are buying for baby / A look at Tupperware's aim to update its
image with a new range for children
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REBECCA ELIAHOO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Tupperware is launching a new range of children's products in Europe as part
of a drive to update its image. Anxious to get away from the image of dreary
suburban life evoked by the 'Tupperware party', the company is now targeting
the working mother.
Lisa Gagliani, UK Tupperware product manager, says the range of children's
feeding equipment will be central to bringing people back to the company's
products.
'Our research in the 1980s showed that Tupperware was becoming invisible to
the modern woman,' she says. 'Since then, we've updated our corporate image
and we believe that our market in the 1990s is the working mother.
Demographically, couples are waiting longer to have children, having fewer
children and spending more on them.'
The new range, called TupperCare, aims to take advantage of these factors:
prices will be about two to three times higher than comparable products from
competitors Mothercare, Boots, Canon, Avent, Tommy Tippee and Maws. The baby
set, for example, which includes bottles, a tumbler and accessories, costs
Pounds 19.95; the set for toddlers on solid foods, includes a bowl, tumbler,
cutlery and tray, and sells for Pounds 25.95.
Gagliani says: 'We're not out to compete on price, but on quality. We have
about 11,000 mothers and fathers in our sales force in the UK and Ireland,
and they believe that parents and grandparents will bear that premium.' Her
sales target for 1993 is Pounds 4m-worth of TupperCare.
There will be no departure in Tupperware's marketing methods and the 'party'
will still be the main outlet for sales.
The idea of the home demonstration began in the US with the chemist, Earl
Tupper, who pioneered the use of plastic containers as household products.
By the 1950s he was selling his products through department stores but found
that retailers were not successfully demonstrating the company's hallmark -
the Tupperware seal which made containers air-tight. Tupper removed his
products from all retail stores and substituted home demonstrations.
By inviting friends and neighbours to a Tupperware party, housewives could
combine a new job opportunity with their social lives. Women were also
selling to women without the fear of a salesman's foot in the door.
Party-goers only needed to watch a 20 minute sales demonstration and if they
got carried away and bought too much, there was a 14-day cooling-off period
during which they could return their purchases.
For the latest children's range, Tupperware Europe's in-house designers
developed the bottles and British consultancy FM Design devised the other
products. Ian Ferris, from FM, visited mother and toddler groups before
starting work on the prototypes.
Says Ferris: 'Mothers have strong views on product design. They don't want
to stay at home with young children, so they need leak-proof bottles and
containers for baby foods. They also felt patronised by products with
'mumsy' patterns and pastel colours. We constantly refined our ideas by
going back to mothers and showing them our proposals.'
In green, coral and mauve, the range features removable bases, which keep
tumblers and plates steady, air-tight seals, interchangeable parts and
cutlery with shaped ends which prevent them slipping into the child's plate.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: A new approach to valuation of the
intangible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN ARNOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEED to resolve the problem of accounting for goodwill is perhaps the
most urgent issue currently facing the Accounting Standards Board. A report
published this week by the Research Board of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales* argues for a radical new approach to the
subject.
The report's basic proposition is that intangibles (including parts of what
is traditionally termed 'goodwill' and internally-created intangibles)
should be permitted to be treated as assets provided that their existence
and value can be satisfactorily justified.
Any goodwill capitalised should be amortized against profit over its useful
economic life. In no circumstances should any part of goodwill be written
off against reserves. There should also be stringent disclosure
requirements.
The ASB has begun to set out its own statement of principles to guide future
standard setting in the UK, which is consistent with the approach adopted by
the International Accounting Standards Committee. The recommendations in the
report are based on those principles.
But there is a fundamental problem which is rarely addressed in statements
of principles. Corporate managers do not like accounting treatments which
result in lower profits or lower reserves.
The former may result in lower managerial remuneration, either because pay
is linked directly to accounting profit or because managers might increase
their value in the labour market by being seen to be involved in running
apparently 'profitable' companies. The latter may restrict borrowing
opportunities or increase the risk of being taken over.
Furthermore, few managers appear to believe in the efficient markets
hypothesis, which suggests that the market can 'see through' accounting
treatments. So they prefer to adopt accounting treatments which show
financial performance and position in the best possible light in the
expectation that this will result in the highest possible share price.
As a result company managers are unlikely to favour accounting treatments
which force them to write-off goodwill against future profits or reserves.
Merger accounting and 're-labelling' (calling goodwill something else) are
two commonplace methods used to avoid write-offs.
Inconsistencies in the treatment of goodwill, both in relation to other
types of assets and internationally, can have economic consequences in so
far as they affect managers' investment decisions and distort the
competitive position of different companies.
Treatments of goodwill most often encountered in practice all have serious
deficiencies. Merger accounting solves the goodwill problem by effectively
making sure a difference on consolidation never arises. But the report
argues that, logically applied, merger accounting should involve the
recognition of goodwill and of the fair value of other assets in respect of
both partners in the merger.
Immediate write-off of goodwill against profit seems unduly conservative and
would certainly be unacceptable to preparers. Capitalisation and subsequent
amortisation appears to be a recognition policy which is markedly less
demanding and introduces inter-period allocations of expenses which are even
more arbitrary than is usual in accounting. Immediate write-off to reserves
would seem to have only one virtue: it makes an embarrassing number go away.
A policy which offers the prospect of combining aspects of immediate
write-off to profit and capitalisation and revaluation/amortisation would
seem to have much to commend it, from the standpoints of theory (in its
consistency with the rest of accounting), informativeness, and acceptability
to preparers.
The report identifies three components of goodwill, as the term is presently
used: (a) the fair value of separately identifiable intangible assets; (b)
the present value of benefits arising from combining activities such as
economies of scale, and from market imperfections such as monopoly position
and barriers to entry; and (c) over - or under-payment.
The report recommends that intangibles included in the first two components
of goodwill described above may be capitalised as assets provided that the
company's directors and auditors are satisfied that they meet the necessary
ceiling test and that the amount at which they are capitalised is no greater
than their recoverable amount.
It will be necessary to apply a ceiling test to the written down value of
goodwill each year. The third component should he written off against profit
if it represents an over-payment, or is transferred to reserves if it is an
under-payment.
Capitalisation of part of purchased goodwill will result in inconsistent
accounting and in an 'uneven playing field' if internally created
intangibles are not treated similarly. For that reason, the report
recommends that internally created intangibles may be dealt with in the same
way as purchased ones - in which case they should be included as assets and
depreciated and should be subject to the same ceiling tests.
In view of the difficulty often experienced in identifying the cost of
internally created intangibles, it is suggested that their inclusion should
be at the discretion of managers, subject always to their satisfying the
auditors of the reasonableness of the existence and value of the assets.
Because the value and sometimes the existence of intangible assets is often
more uncertain and almost always less well understood than that of tangible
assets, their inclusion in balance sheets will call for a higher level of
disclosure to enable users to form judgements concerning the reasonableness
of the values used and the benefits and costs of recognising the
intangibles.
Disclosures might include the basis on which the valuation has been made,
the identity of the valuer and the cost of undertaking the valuation. This
would enable users to assess the reliability of the valuations and whether
the information they provide is worth the cost incurred.
The development of appropriate ceiling tests to substantiate the value of
any components of goodwill which are carried as assets is of central
importance. They should be based either on a direct assessment of the
continuing value of goodwill which has not been written off, using
discounted cash flow techniques, or on an examination of the rate of return
being earned on the net value of acquired assets.
A particular problem is that the assets of many acquired companies are
redistributed among other companies in the group. In that case, the ceiling
tests will need to be applied to identifiable business units rather than to
acquired companies.
There are inevitably numerous other practical problems. Nevertheless, the
results so far of applying the tests to some actual acquisitions are
encouraging and do seem to offer a way forward.
Many of the report's recommendations are likely to be controversial: the
requirement that all write-offs must be against profit rather than to
reserves; the recognition of internally-created intangibles; the explicit
recognition of over-payment as a cast to be written-off immediately; and the
extensive disclosure requirements.
It is hoped that the recommendations provide the basis for an acceptable and
feasible way forward. The consequences of the ASB failing to find an
acceptable solution to the problem of accounting for goodwill could be as
dire as were the consequences of the current cost accounting debacle for the
ASC.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Truck and van sales drop sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES raised in August of an end to the decline in sales of UK commercial
vehicles have been dented by a further sharp fall last month.
Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show that total
commercial vehicle sales were down 14.22 per cent to 15,548 from September
last year.
Sales in the first three quarters, at 157,646, were 6.85 per cent lower than
the 169,233 in the same period last year.
However, one possible sign that parts of the market may be showing signs of
recovery was provided by registrations of new trucks - vehicles over 3.5
tonnes - and buses and coaches.
Truck registrations rose 2.13 per cent to 2,738 from 2,681 in September last
year, the third successive monthly rise. That meant sales in the third
quarter were 5.4 per cent higher than in the same quarter last year, at
8,308 units. For the first three quarters of the year as a whole, they
remained 5.1 per cent lower at 23,371, down from 24,625.
The recovery is concentrated in the heavy truck sector - those over 15
tonnes. Sales for the year so far are only 0.9 per cent below last year,
while those under 15 tonnes are down 9.1 per cent. The much smaller market
for buses and coaches saw an increase of 26.6 per cent in sales last month,
to 157 from 124, lifting sales in the first three quarters to 1,644, up 5.65
per cent.
Anecdotal evidence is starting to support the evidence of sales indicators
that the worst may be over in the heavy trucks sector. For example, Lex
Service's truck-leasing subsidiary is reporting a recovery in short-term
truck rental business. It believes that is a consequence of cautious
hauliers experiencing an increase in demand but not yet wishing to commit
themselves to purchases of new trucks.
Leyland DAF won back leadership of the truck market last month from Iveco
Ford, with 28.7 per cent to Iveco's 24.6 per cent, and is marginally ahead
for the year so far.
Hopes of an end to the slide in the commercial vehicle market, which began
in the third quarter of 1989, were raised in June when sales rose 5.2 per
cent after 32 consecutive months of decline. In July, though, sales dropped
once more - by nearly 21 per cent.
All other categories of vehicles saw their sales fall steeply last month.
Sales of light vans, mainly derived from cars, fell 12.31 per cent, to 4,782
from 5,453, while those of medium-sized vans such as the Ford Transit fell
by 20.01 per cent, to 6,794 from 8,493. Sales of four-wheel-drive utility
vehicles dropped 21.68 per cent, to 1,077.
Motor industry analysts said the weakness of van sales reflected a
continuing lack of confidence across the economy. Many such vehicles are
bought by retailers and other small traders, sectors facing record levels of
bankruptcies.
Ford is to suspend production of Transit vans at its Southampton plant for a
week from Monday.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Whalen calls for cut in interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Geoffrey Whalen, chief executive of Peugeot-Talbot, the UK subsidiary of
the French carmaker, last night called for a cut of 1 percentage point in
interest rates 'as soon as possible', Kevin Done writes.
He said that the government should not embark on a 'mad dash for growth' and
added that any reduction should 'not be of such a size as to threaten the
control of inflation'.
He said that an early return to the European exchange rate mechanism should
be ruled out, as that would prevent the cut in interest rates that the
economy desperately needed.
He said that industry needed 'to be persuaded that when the government says
that it cares about the survival and future well-being of British
manufacturing industry, it really means it.
'As a first and basic step, all cabinet ministers should be told that in all
that they and their departments do, manufacturing industry's needs ought to
be considered with the greatest care.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Output fall disappoints Treasury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH industrial production continued to 'bump along the bottom' in August
as short-time working in the car industry caused manufacturing output to
fall by 0.2 per cent compared with July.
According to seasonally adjusted figures from the Central Statistical Office
(CSO), output of the production industries, which include energy as well as
manufacturing, fell by 0.3 per cent in the month and was barely changed from
the level in August last year.
The Treasury said August's fall in overall industrial production was
'obviously disappointing' but followed a sharp rise of 1 per cent in the
output of the production industries in July. The August fall in
manufacturing production was 'more than accounted for by a very sharp drop
in car production', it said. Figures for both the manufacturing and
production industries showed a rise in output of only 0.1 per cent in the
three months to the end of August compared with the March-to-May period.
The latest three months' figures showed a 0.8 per cent drop in manufacturing
production and a 1.4 per cent fall in output of the production industries,
compared with the three months to the end of August last year.
UK manufacturing output has moved in a narrow range over the past six
months, prompting the CSO to estimate that its present annual 'trend' rate
of growth is 0.5 per cent.
Some city analysts expect overall industrial production to fall over the
rest of the year, as a result of cuts in output, lack of confidence and the
large-scale cuts in the coal industry announced this week.
Although the August figures matched City expectations they did nothing to
lighten the gloom caused by the recent wave of redundancies and the planned
pit closures.
The figures put the drop in car output at nearly 10 per cent in August,
reflecting short-time working at some of Ford's UK plants.
The statistics also showed a fall in coal and coke production of 5.2 per
cent in the three months to August compared with the three months to the end
of May, and a drop of 9.3 per cent compared with the June-to-August period
last year.
Output of the metals and chemicals industries also fell in the three months
to August. Among the strongest performers were the brewing and soft-drink
industries, reflecting a hot spell in June, and the paper, printing and
publishing industries.

FT  15 OCT 92 / 'Green' measures cost Pounds 14bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL protection cost Pounds 14bn last year, about 2.5 per cent of
gross domestic product, a government survey said yesterday.
Nearly half, Pounds 6.7bn, was the cost of cleaning up river pollution and
purifying water, it said. Much of that sum is eventually borne by water
customers, whose bills may double in real terms in the next decade as the
water companies comply with EC environmental rules.
Nearly a quarter of the spending, Pounds 3bn, was to reduce pollution by all
kinds of waste. Industry was forced by new laws to spend about Pounds 2.4bn
on curbing air pollution. The balance was spent on cleaning up land and
reducing noise.
The figures, which count only 'pure environmental' investment and probably
underestimate 'green' spending, suggest that government paid a third of the
total bill, with industry and households footing the rest.
The report, which draws together data on the whole UK environment - air
quality, land, water, the sea and coasts, wildlife, waste and radioactivity
 -shows that some standards have deteriorated. Carbon monoxide emissions
rose by 30 per cent since 1980, mainly from transport, and emissions of
black smoke from transport also doubled since then. Average concentrations
of nitrogen dioxide, mainly from traffic, increased by 35 per cent between
1986 and 1991.
However, lead emissions from vehicles, which caused concern for their effect
on children's development, have fallen by 70 per cent since the mid 1980s
with the arrival of unleaded petrol.
About 3 per cent of cancer deaths may derive from radiation exposure, the
report said. Fall-out from nuclear weapons testing and the Chernobyl
accident contribute less than 1 per cent of the annual average dose of
radiation, but radon, a naturally occurring gas, accounts for more than
half.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Uphill struggle for the labour market: Jobless totals may
not peak until 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE recent surge in announcements of job losses from some of Britain's
best-known companies has renewed speculation about when, and at what level,
unemployment will reach its peak.
As recently as two months ago, government economists were confident that
unemployment would not touch 3m. That now seems highly optimistic.
Many independent economists now say unemployment will peak at just over 3m -
a little under 11 per cent of the workforce - at the end of next year or
early in 1994. Some are more pessimistic, suggesting that the growth in
unemployment will not cease until 1995.
Confusion over the government's economic policy, in particular over
movements in interest rates, makes it difficult for economists to forecast
when unemployment will start to fall. The worst-case scenario of Ernst &amp;
Young's Item Club - a forecasting body that uses the Treasury's economic
model - sees an early return to the European exchange rate mechanism and
tighter monetary policy. That might delay the recovery, in which case
unemployment is projected to peak at about 3.6m in 1995.
Even in that scenario, the lag between a resumption of growth and and a
turnround in unemployment is expected to be shorter than it was in the early
1980s. When the economy started to emerge from recession in early 1981, the
jobless level continued to rise until 1986, when it peaked at a rate of 11
per cent.
This time, economists expect the lag to be much shorter. They argue that
reforms affecting the labour market have created a much swifter link between
a fall in output and a rise in unemployment, and conversely between an
increase in output and a fall in unemployment.
Another influence that should help to shorten the unemployment lag is
demographic. Between 1981 and 1985, the working population was growing at an
average of 200,000 a year as a result of the 1960s baby boom. Between 1991
and 1995 the working population will grow at only 20,000 a year.
Recent announcements of further big job losses in the manufacturing sector
have led to fears that there has been an acceleration in the trend growth
rate of the jobless total from 30,000 a month.
Mr John Philpott, director of the Employment Policy Institute, the
independent think tank, says: 'It seems that a lot of employers were holding
back over the summer, waiting to see what would happen to the economy. As
the recovery still appears to be a long way off, employers have embarked on
another round of big redundancies.'
Apart from the most recent British Coal announcement this week, many of the
recent cuts have hit the south-east disproportionately hard. The defence and
electronics industries - such as those at British Aerospace - appear to have
taken the brunt of recent cuts and both have a strong presence in the
south-east.
According to the latest survey by Hay Management Consultants on the
distribution of job losses across the UK as a whole, the manufacturing,
engineering and service sectors have suffered worst.
But Mr David Fell, economist at Business Strategies, the economics
consultancy, says that although unemployment is rising fastest in the
south-east and the south-west, the level was lower in those regions at the
start of the recession.
Nevertheless he believes that regional differences in unemployment rates
will be smaller in the future. However, the overall rates being predicted by
Business Strategies for the mid 1990s look frighteningly high. It sees rates
of above 10 per cent for every region apart from Wales and East Anglia, with
the south-west at 15.3 per cent, the west Midlands at 14.4 per cent, and the
north-west at 14 per cent.
The recent devaluation of sterling might help those companies producing for
export or in competition with imports, but it may take some time to show.
Government economists point to the fact that even before the pound came out
of the ERM on September 16, unit labour costs were growing at about the same
rate as those of the UK's main competitors.
So, in spite of the recent acceleration in unemployment, there is one ray of
hope. The devaluation of sterling will give exporters a costs benefit,
enabling them to expand market share, which should eventually boost
employment.

The Continuous Mortality Investigation Bureau and the Institute of Actuaries
and Faculty of Actuaries, in a review of 500,000 people, found that the most
frequent age of death for male smokers was 81, while male non-smokers most
frequently died at 87. For women smokers, the most frequent age of death was
85 while non-smoking women typically live until 91.

The finding comes in a survey of nearly 800 women published today by Sussex
University on behalf of employers including Marks and Spencer and Barclays

Before taking a career break, 84 per cent of women were very satisfied or
satisfied with the way they were promoted at work. After returning to work,
that dropped to 64 per cent.

are damaged after taking a break to have a baby.
The finding comes in a survey covering nearly 800 women, published today by
Sussex University and carried out on behalf of leading employers including
Marks and Spencer, Barclays Bank, the Treasury, Shell (UK) and the Wellcome
Foundation.
Before taking a career break, 84 per cent of women were very satisfied or
satisfied with the way they were promoted at work. After returning to work,
that dropped to 64 per cent.
Ms Wendy Hirsh, co-author of the report, said women felt employers were
taking an increasingly positive attitude to providing career breaks.
'However, they are much less sure about their future career opportunities.
Many feel their careers have to take a back seat, at least for a while, and
that their line managers see them as less promotable once they have become
mothers.'
Evidence of discrimination in promotion was not established by the survey.
Only 9 per cent of the sample returned to a job at a lower level than before
the career break; a third had been promoted within a short time of returning
to work and substantial numbers had made sideways moves. The researchers had
no comparable figures for men.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Westland EH101 helicopter available
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A PRE-PRODUCTION model of Westland's EH101 anti-submarine and troop-carrying
helicopter was made available yesterday at the company's Yeovil headquarters
for a brief flight by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary.
The aircraft, developed in collaboration with the Italian company Agusta,
has already been ordered by the Royal Navy, with the Italian and Canadian
governments indicating their intentions to place orders in the near future.
Mr Heseltine originally signed the contract authorising the go-ahead of the
EH101 programme in 1984 and the future of Westland lay at the heart of the
cabinet row that resulted in his resignation from the government in 1986.
He said: 'I am keen to see EH101 achieve the further major export success it
deserves.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Actors' union and BBC in payments row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITY, the actors' union, has decided to end its agreement with the BBC
covering payments for programmes sold to satellite channels and overseas
broadcasters.
The row has blown up over payments to actors for programmes to be shown on
UK Gold, the new satellite channel founded by the BBC and Thames Television.
Mr Ian McGarry, Equity general secretary, said that members of the union's
council 'went bananas' when they heard actors were being offered 4 per cent
of their original fee for two showings on UK Gold.
Mr McGarry will announce today that the union is serving the required
six-month notice to end the multi-media agreement covering programme sales
first agreed in 1986. That gave actors 17 per cent of gross sales figures.
'This is the worst row we have had with the BBC,' Mr McGarry said.
There was disagreement last night on whether UK Gold would be affected.
Mr Derek Lewis, the executive responsible for launching the channel, said UK
Gold had a 10-year programme supply agreement with the BBC and he had been
assured that the agreement would be honoured.
Equity insists that it has no agreement with the BBC for UK Gold and is
taking legal advice on whether the programmes can be broadcast.
The union argues that there is an important difference between sales of
individual programmes in an open market and supply deals for programmes
between the BBC and UK Gold.
Mr James Arnold-Baker, managing director of the commercial arm of the BBC,
is in Cannes, selling BBC programmes. Such deals amount to Pounds 70m a
year. He said: 'We think we are selling a lot of programmes, but whether we
can fulfil the contracts is another matter.'

FT  15 OCT 92 / CBI plea to PM on Europe: Employers urge caution over
re-entry to exchange rate mechanism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Confederation of British Industry called on Mr John Major, the prime
minister, yesterday to ensure that Britain did not risk its economic future
by becoming a 'semi-detached' member of the European community.
The plea, which was issued as the prime minister prepares for tomorrow's EC
summit in Birmingham, was accompanied by a warning that Britain should not
re-enter the European exchange rate mechanism until tensions have eased
between German and British monetary policy.
The CBI also emphasised that the government should do nothing to close off
the option of re-entry.
In a letter to Mr Major, the CBI criticised aspects of the community's
development and the performance of the EC Commission, but it quoted the
prime minister in contending that Britain had to remain at the heart of
Europe.
Sir Michael Angus, CBI president, voiced concern that any failure by Britain
to ratify the Maastricht treaty would transmit the wrong signals about the
country's future position in the community and damage its ability to attract
critical inward investment.
Sir Michael said that the Birmingham summit had to make progress on the
issue of subsidiarity, which needed to be emphasised and expanded in a clear
summit declaration.
The powers of the Commission, he added, had to be more tightly constrained,
although it also needed to ensure that member states were not able to
provide financial assistance to industry through 'the back door of
subsidiarity'.
Sir Michael called on Mr Major to press for improvements in the way the
Commission conducts its business, suggesting the wider use of green papers
to ensure that the implications of proposed directives are fully understood
by the business community.
Sir Michael criticised the Commission for failing to enforce single market
directives evenly across the community. He said CBI members resented the
Commission's 'intrusive and sometimes erratic' approach to regulation and
legislation, and called on Mr Major to press home measures to complete the
single market, an objective that was being overlooked in the broader debate
over the community's future.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Unified strategy urged for Midlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS leaders in the west Midlands anxious for more inward investment to
stimulate the regional economy, are demanding closer co-ordination by the
many organisations responsible for attracting companies to the region.
A survey by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, in Birmingham, found
that about three quarters of 300 private and public-sector executives
perceived conflicts of interests between the organisations involved.
More than half the private-sector executives and nearly three quarters of
the public-sector executives were dissatisfied with regional promotion.
The disquiet reflects the downturn of inward investment in the region over
the past two years. During the 1980s, the west Midlands successful in
attracting overseas companies. In 1986-90, 21 per cent of British inward
investment projects went to the west Midlands, a figure that dropped to 14
per cent last year.

THE UK's top commercial lawyers are the most expensive in the world,
charging Dollars 235 an hour more than their counterparts in the US,
according to an annual survey of international law firms in the
International Financial Law Review 1000. Figures show that the average
hourly rate for legal advice from a partner in a top City of London law firm
rose 20 per cent over the past 12 months to Dollars 585 an hour.
The top rate for a partner in the most expensive Wall Street firms is
Dollars 350 an hour and average hourly rates for partners in US firms are
Dollars 230.
After the UK, Germany has the most expensive law firms, with top commercial
lawyers charging Dollars 510 an hour, followed by Switzerland (Dollars 445),
Austria (Dollars 385), Japan (Dollars 350) and Hong Kong (Dollars 325).
The figures were dismissed yesterday by City lawyers as misleading. Mr Adam
Quarry of City-based solicitors Linklaters &amp; Paines said the survey was 'not
comparing like with like' and was 'a gross oversimplification' of billing
practices.
Rates quoted were partner rates whereas the true cost to a client of using
the firm's services would be a blended average of the hourly rates of the
different grades of lawyers who worked on it, he said.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Ministers weigh future of London's hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS will today begin considering a report which is likely to lead to
the biggest ever shake-up in London's hospital services.
The final version of the report by Sir Bernard Tomlinson, former chairman of
the Northern Regional Health Authority, is in the hands of Mrs Virginia
Bottomley, health secretary. Mrs Bottomley - who has received regular
progress reports from Sir Bernard during his year-long investigation of
health provision in London - will publish the report around the end of this
month.
There will then be a period of consultation - and furious campaigning by
hospitals identified for closure - before ministers make final decisions in
the new year.
Some of the capital's most famous teaching hospitals - including St
Bartholomew's, St Thomas', University College, the Middlesex and Charing
Cross - have been considered for closure or change of use during Sir
Bernard's inquiry.
In a last-minute submission to Sir Bernard last week, the St Thomas'
management said the capital costs associated with closing either St Thomas'
or the neighbouring Guy's teaching hospital would be so great as to 'negate
for at least the first 10 years' any revenue savings.'
St Thomas' management argued that both hospitals should survive, with St
Thomas' concentrating on emergency and local work and Guy's developing
specialist services.
Under that plan, three local hospitals in south London - Hither Green in
Lewisham, Dulwich in Southwark and Brook in Greenwich - would close instead
of either of the teaching hospitals.
Guy's accident and emergency department would close under the plan, which
argues that a combination of St Thomas' and University College hospitals
would provide the most effective emergency cover for central London.
No solution excluding St Thomas', the submission says, would provide cover
within 10 minutes for Whitehall and state occasions in Westminster.
The St Thomas' research draws on work commissioned from Ernst and Young,
management consultants, transport specialists at Imperial College, London,
and other sources.
In its submission, the St Thomas' management challenges the view of South
East Thames Regional Health Authority that either St Thomas' or Guy's could
close - eliminating 800 beds in addition to other rationalisation plans in
south London.
There is, the submission says, no evidence that local health services in
south London would be in place to support reduced demand on hospital beds.

THE UK's top commercial lawyers are the most expensive in the world,
charging Dollars 235 an hour more than their counterparts in the US,
according to an annual survey of international law firms.
The 1992 figures from the International Financial Law Review 1000 show that
the average hourly rate for legal advice from a partner in a top City of
London law firm rose 20 per cent over the past 12 months to Dollars 585 an
hour.
The top rate for a partner in the most expensive Wall Street firms is
Dollars 350 an hour and average hourly rates for partners in US firms are
Dollars 230.
After the UK, Germany has the most expensive law firms, with top commercial

The rates quoted were partner rates whereas the overall hourly rate for a
job - the true cost to a client of using the firm's services - would be a
blended average of the hourly rates of the different grades of lawyers who
worked on it, he said.
US law firms bill clients for many more hours per lawyer than UK firms and
tend to staff jobs differently.
He said he would be 'very surprised' if rates for City partners had risen by
20 per cent over the past year, given the state of the market. Linklaters
increased its hourly charge rates 'slightly' in July this year - the first
increase since May 1990.
Other surveys of international law firms showed that Wall Street firms were
in general more profitable than their City counterparts.

A FURTHER 121 National Health Service hospitals and community health

With 284 trusts due to be operating by April 1993, that will bring the total

Dr Mawhinney said the creation of trusts had brought an 8.2 per cent

Ostensibly, the Jordanian monarch flew to Cairo to offer condolences for

It effectively marks the end of the king's isolation in Arab councils. He

Cambodian head of state Prince Norodom Sihanouk said the only solution in

by the UN-sponsored peace plan was to proceed without them and divide the
nation into separate controlled zones, AP reports from Phnom Penh.
The Khmer Rouge yesterday refused to move despite a UN warning that
Cambodian elections will be held by next May with or without Khmer Rouge
participation. However, the UN peacekeeping chief in Cambodia expressed
strong opposition to the idea of dividing the nation.
Prince Sihanouk, head of a council grouping all four rival Cambodian
factions, said dividing Cambodia would be the best way to settle the dilemma
of the Khmer Rouge boycott of the election.

FT  15 OCT 92 / OECD cuts growth forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has drastically
cut its forecast of growth in the industrialised world next year, largely
because of sharp downward revisions of expected output in the US and Europe.
Internal OECD forecasts now suggest that growth in the organisation's 24
member states will be only 2.1 per cent in 1993, compared with 3 per cent
forecast for next year in June. It has scaled back its forecast of US growth
to 2.4 per cent in 1993 from 3.6 per cent in June and its growth forecast
for Japan to 2.6 per cent next year from 3.1 per cent four months ago. It
expects Japan to grow by 3 per cent in 1994.
These figures imply that growth in the European member states of the OECD
will be about 1.5 per cent next year compared with the June forecast of 2.4
per cent. The OECD now expects unemployment in Europe will average 10.4 per
cent of the labour force next year against expectations in June of a 9.3 per
cent jobless rate. Unemployment in all OECD countries is now expected to
average 8.2 per cent in 1993 against 7.3 per cent four months ago.
The figures for the US and Japan are more precise than those for other parts
of the OECD because it has just completed its annual surveys of these
economies and will publish them shortly.
Although the picture is incomplete, OECD officials decided to publicise the
figures because of the marked deterioration in the industrialised world's
economic prospects since mid-year. Mr Kumiharu Shigehara, head of the OECD
economics and statistics department, disclosed some figures during a visit
to Japan this week. He blamed the bleak growth outlook on restrictive bank
lending, a lack of business investment and private consumption and high
long-term US interest rates.
The OECD now expects its member states will grow by 1.5 per cent overall
this year, compared with forecast growth of 1.8 per cent in June and 2.9 per
cent forecast in July 1991. Both Japan and the US are forecast to grow by
1.8 per cent in 1992 against growth of about 1 per cent in the OECD's
European member countries this year.
The OECD said yesterday that it now expects unemployment in Europe will rise
to 9.9 per cent this year against its June forecast of 9.3 per cent, while
the jobless rate in all its members is expected to average 7.9 per cent
against 7.5 per cent in the previous forecast. The OECD declined to provide
any breakdown of its European growth or jobless forecasts, although earlier
this month Mr Jean-Claude Paye, the organisation's secretary general, put
German growth this year at 1 per cent.
About the only good news is that inflation will stay subdued. The OECD has
left unchanged its forecasts that inflation, measured by the GDP deflator,
will average 3.5 per cent this year and 3.2 per cent in 1993 in its 24
member states.

<TEXT>
SOUTH Korea's ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP) yesterday appeared in
danger of losing its slim parliamentary majority.
A decision by five MPs to leave the party reduced the DLP's representation
to 154 seats in the 299-member National Assembly.
The DLP is being convulsed by an internal dispute over the party leadership
and the defection of more MPs is expected within the next few days.
They are likely to form a new conservative party to oppose Mr Kim Young-sam,
the DLP nominee in the December presidential election.
The DLP lost its parliamentary majority by one seat in last March's National
Assembly elections, but was then able to retain control of the unicameral
chamber by persuading 10 independent MPs to join the ruling party.
The DLP previously had a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The rebellion within is being staged by MPs associated with President Roh's
majority faction.
They believe that Mr Kim is gaining too much power in spite of his minority
status in the DLP.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN received further evidence of economic slowdown yesterday, as
bankruptcy figures rose, corporate advertising and entertainment spending
declined, and crude steel output posted a double-digit dip.
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, yesterday expressed his concern,
stressing the need for adjustments to corporate inventories and individuals'
stock of durable goods, before the country's economy could recover.
Bankruptcies last month rose 35.3 per cent from the same month last year, to
1,145 cases, in the 24th consecutive year-on-year rise. Liabilities rose
24.9 per cent from a year earlier, to Y706.7bn (Pounds 3.3bn).
Liabilities were up by 85.9 per cent from the previous month due to the rise
in large-scale bankruptcies of real estate companies. Teikoku Data Bank, the
private credit research agency, said failures of manufacturing,
transportation and communications companies had all risen by 85 per cent
from the previous year.
In the six months to September, bankruptcies rose a year-on-year 32.6 per
cent, to 6,952 cases. However, total liabilities fell by 6.1 per cent to
Y3,583.6bn, declining for the first time since the second half of fiscal
year 1989.
Teikoku attributed the decline to large-scale failures of land and stock
speculators.
Bankruptcies stemming from 'zaitech' - speculative land and stock investment
 -fell in both number and size, with the total number of cases falling 5 per
cent to 115, and liabilities decreasing 19.8 per cent to Y638.6bn.
However, failures of real estate companies increased, reflecting the virtual
halt of trading in real estate. The sector posted a 9.6 per cent increase,
to 571 cases, while liabilities for the six months surged 43.7 per cent to
Y1,153.9bn.
Figures released by Teikoku also revealed a plunge in corporate advertising
and entertainment spending, reflecting cost-cutting efforts. In fiscal year
1991, which ran to last March, advertising spending by leading companies
totalled Y783.5bn, down 25.4 per cent from fiscal 1987, the height of the
'bubble' boom. Entertainment spending at the leading 1,000 companies fell
15.3 per cent to Y111.7bn.
Meanwhile, the Japan Iron and Steel Federation yesterday announced that
Japan's crude steel production for the first half of the 1992 fiscal year
fell 12.6 per cent from a year before, to 48.6m tons.
The federation said it was the first time in five years the figure had
fallen short of 50m tons, and blamed the sharp fall in demand from
industries.

FT  15 OCT 92 / The Don has gone - let the battle begin: The party and
policy consequences of the departure of backroom maestro Kanemaru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRUISING past the Japanese parliament building in the centre of Tokyo, a
taxi driver summed up the collective disbelief of Japan over the resignation
of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the political godfather, kingmaker, powerbroker and
much more: 'He should have resigned a long time ago, but I never thought he
would.'
There was surprise that the disgraced and distant Mr Kanemaru had resigned
because of public controversy. But there was also a deep sense of concern
over what would happen next - and a realisation that the departure of one
man would not change a complex political structure with many pretenders to
be the next Shin Kanemaru.
The demise of the Don has already provoked struggles within the faction over
which he has presided. It is the largest faction in the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP), claiming credit for having appointed the past few
prime ministers and proud of its ancestry, traced back to Kakuei Tanaka, who
ruled in the early 1970s and beyond.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, and an MP since 1958, has been the target of unusually
bitter public protests over the past month, after having admitted that he
received Y500m (Pounds 2.3m) from a scandal-stained parcel delivery company
called Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin. But he had presumed that his political life
would return to normal after the protests died down.
Instead, the protests continued and members of his own party this week
demanded that he resign, apparently convincing Mr Kanemaru that his
influence was permanently damaged.
His motives may never be known, as he is spare with his words, which are
generally delivered in an almost unintelligible mumble. (When he first
admitted receiving the Y500m, the statement had to be read again for the
confused gathering of journalists.)
Mumbling aside, Mr Kanemaru has clearly been the most influential Japanese
politician in recent years. He has supported the concept of
'internationalisation,' been active in improving relations with North Korea
and China, and played a decisive role in the drafting of the
recently-announced emergency economic package.
Unlike most western countries, the departure of the most powerful politician
will not mean a shift to the left or right in policy. Mr Kanemaru is no
ideologue. His vision was that of the backroom maestro, who could raise
campaign funds, and muster the numbers within his faction and the party to
push through a piece of legislation or secure the appointment of a prime
minister.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the present prime minister, owes his term in office to
Mr Kanemaru. It is a measure of his dependence on the Don that he has been
as confused as most Japanese by the events of recent days. When the
resignation was confirmed, the prime minister, dazed by the day's events,
shook his head and said: 'It's a very unfortunate thing.'
Perhaps Mr Miyazawa has a vision of a troubled future that includes months
of factional infighting and a crippled LDP. The faction, one of five, could
split, creating more indecision than usual in a party that took months to
respond coherently to the outbreak of the Gulf war. Mr Kanemaru's exit may
be a setback for Japan's cherished aim of a political role appropriate to
its international economic influence.
His chosen successor was Mr Ichiro Ozawa, a good friend of the US ambassador
to Japan, Mr Michael Armacost, and the man most foreign governments would
like to see at the helm. But the premature departure of Mr Kanemaru has left
Mr Ozawa without the numbers he needs to secure his power, and facing a
challenge from Mr Seiroku Kajiyama, a former justice minister, whose
backroom skills are as polished as his ambition is fierce.
Japanese are agreed that Mr Kanemaru represents the 'old ways,' but Mr
Kajiyama is even more of a throwback. He has cultivated strong ties with
business interests, ensuring his ability to then cultivate younger
politicians, who are dependent on factional patrons for funds.
However, Mr Kajiyama does not have the prestige needed to influence other
LDP factions or opposition parties, as was frequently done by Mr Kanemaru in
guiding legislation through parliament.
The weakness of Mr Kajiyama could provide an opportunity for Mr Noboru
Takeshita, the former prime minister, to preside again over the faction,
which he headed in the 1980s. The role is akin to that of Deng Xiaoping's
reign in China - there is not necessarily a government or party title, but
there is immense power, exercised selectively and out of public view.
Months of scandal and the embarrassing resignation of a government
powerbroker should provide much hope for opposition parties, but Japan's
largest opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, was yesterday
distracted by a dispute over its leadership. Younger MPs, frustrated by the
SDP's apparent determination to remain eternally irrelevent, demanded that
the leader, Mr Makoto Tanabe, also resign.
Mr Tanabe was accused by the younger MPs of allowing his close friendship
with Mr Kanemaru to compromise the party's strategy against the LDP.
It is typical of the hierarchical nature of Japanese politics that their
shared roles as elder statesmen created a bond far more durable than their
ideological differences.

KING HUSSEIN of Jordan yesterday paid his first visit to Egypt in more than
two years, signalling its return to the Arab mainstream.
Ostensibly, the Jordanian monarch flew to Cairo to offer condolences for
victims of Monday's earthquake, but his mission had a broader significance.
It effectively marks the end of the king's isolation in Arab councils. He
had been ostracised by fellow moderate Arab rulers incensed at Jordan's
support for Iraq in the Gulf crisis.
King Hussein - the Arab world's longest-serving leader - has been edging
back towards the Arab mainstream for some months. His 'rehabilitation' was
accelerated by his recent struggle with cancer and the sympathy it
engendered among his brother-Arabs.
Both President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia sent
personal emissaries to the Jordanian monarch's bedside to wish him a speedy
recovery from the cancer which resulted in the loss of one of his kidneys.
During his brief stay in Cairo, the king discussed with Mr Mubarak regional
issues, including current efforts to advance the peace process.

ANGOLA waited nervously last night for the publication of final official
election results as Mr Pik Botha, South African foreign minister, continued
his efforts to resolve the country's crisis, writes Julian Ozanne in Luanda.
The National Electoral Commission said it would release final results
yesterday, despite threats by Unita, the former rebel movement which lost
last month's elections, that doing so would provoke a violent reaction.
Unita, which has alleged massive election fraud, has demanded that an
investigation into its claims be allowed to complete its work before final
results are released.
Observers were pressing the MPLA government of President Jose Eduardo dos
Santos to wait 48 hours as a concession to Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita
leader.
Western observers said that unofficial returns indicated that Mr dos Santos
might not get more than a 50 per cent majority needed to avoid a
presidential run-off.
Mr Botha yesterday met top government officials to pass on messages from Mr
Savimbi to Mr dos Santos, whom he was due to meet last night.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US TRADE officials in Tokyo believe the next US administration will have to
push for further measures to open the Japanese market in the light of
Japan's ever growing trade surplus, writes Charles Leadbeater in Tokyo.
Japan had a record surplus of Dollars 52bn in the first half of this fiscal
year to September, a rise of 32 per cent from the same period last year,
according to figures for customs-cleared trade published yesterday by the
finance ministry.
The trade figures show a record surplus last month, of about Dollars 12.1bn,
a 24 per cent rise from last year. The rise in the surplus is largely due to
the stagnation of the Japanese economy, which has choked off imports, and
aggressive exporting by Japan's manufacturers.
One explanation for the relative lack of controversy in the US over the
growing Japanese surplus may be that its surplus with Europe is growing
faster.
Japan's trade surplus with the EC in September was Dollars 3.5bn, with
exports up 19.3 per cent on a year before, to Dollars 5.9bn, and imports up
9.7 per cent, to Dollars 2.4bn. In the first half of the fiscal year,
Japan's trade surplus with the EC was Dollars 16.3bn, fuelled by an 11 per
cent rise in exports from the same period last year.
In contrast, exports to the US grew at 5.8 per cent last month to Dollars
9bn, the same rate as the growth of imports, to create a September trade
surplus with the US of Dollars 4.8bn. Exports to the US in the first half of
the fiscal year grew by 6.6 per cent to almost Dollars 47bn, while imports
into Japan fell by 0.8 per cent to Dollars 21.1bn.

<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S legislative council (Legco) yesterday supported one of the more
controversial proposals in Mr Chris Patten's policy speech, providing local
solidarity in advance of the governor's visit to Beijing next week, writes
Simon Davies in Hong Kong.
The council gave firm approval to Mr Patten's recommendation to create an
election committee comprising democratically-elected district board members,
who will then select 10 out of the 60 seats in Legco in 1995.
The debate was raised by a councillor to provide a vote of confidence for Mr
Patten's package of proposals, and its underlying theme of broadening
democracy in the colony, while remaining within the confines of the Basic
Law - the mini-constitution governing Hong Kong after the handover to China
in 1997. China, however, has continued its barrage of criticism. Mr Zhou
Nan, director of the Hong Kong branch of the New China News Agency, said
that the policy speech was unacceptable to the Chinese.
Hong Kong's pro-China newspapers went further. Ta Kung Pao claimed that Mr
Patten was fighting only for Britain's interests, while a commentary in Wen
Wei Pao stated that the proposals contained three breaches of the Basic Law.
These included a breach of the agreement that the social and economic
systems of the colony would remain unchanged during the transition period.
During yesterday's Legco debate, pro-Beijing trade unionist Mr Tam Yiu-chung
questioned the rationale for the motion, claiming the election committee
would be opposed from Beijing. There were also arguments from the liberal
camp that the 10 seats should be directly elected, while at the conservative
end of the spectrum there were concerns over possible aggravation of China;
but there remained a strong consensus that the council should display
initial loyalty to its new president.
This will strengthen Mr Patten's argument to China that he has the Hong Kong
people's mandate for his proposals. However, Legco members had little
expectation that these could survive without some amendment, under pressure
from China.

FT  15 OCT 92 / China steps down the path of securities regulation: Simon
Holberton finds the Beijing government responding at last to the needs of
disaffected investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPURRED on by riots this summer by 1m disaffected investors in the Shenzen
stock exchange the Chinese government appears ready to promulgate national
laws governing securities trading.
According to central bank officials and diplomats in Beijing, China could,
by the end of this year, have set up a national securities regulatory
regime.
To date, the stock markets in Shenzhen and Shanghai are regulated by local
authorities.
According to an official, responsibilities for securities markets will be
transferred from the People's Bank, China's central bank, to a Securities
Commission and a Securities Supervisory Committee to be established under
the State Council, or cabinet, later this year.
The People's Bank will, however, supply the officials to run at least one of
the bodies to be established, he indicated.
The reason why two are needed is unclear, but it could reflect battles over
turf between competing bureaucratic interests, diplomats say. They note that
10 government agencies and ministries have a finger in the pie of securities
market supervision.
The establishment of regulatory bodies, will, however, give China the
semblance, at least, of national control and regulation of stock markets.
This might lessen the concerns of some foreign investors who have shied away
from its stock markets for lack of regulation and given those who have taken
the plunge added confidence.
Foreign interest in China's fledgling stock markets is growing. At the
latest count, western merchant banks have raised more than Dollars 1bn to
invest in shares listed on Shenzhen or Shanghai. This represents about 13
per cent of the current market capitalisation of both bourses of about
Dollars 7.6bn.
But, for the wary, the lack of acceptable accounting standards and a
regulatory framework which offers protection to minority shareholders -
which foreigners by law are - has made many suspicious of investing.
The law in China is disorganised. The National People's Congress, a fairly
tame parliament, passes laws; the State Council issues 'decisions;' and
government departments and agencies promulgate regulations.
All have the force of law, but their administration is capricious -
Communist party officials are wont to dabble - and their means of
interpretation are far from clear.
All this leads to an opaqueness in decision-making. One western diplomat,
talking about the way companies are chosen for listing, observed: 'Often it
appears to have much to do with the strength of a company's political
connections as it does with the intrinsic nature of the businesses.'
But whatever Beijing does to bring its regulation in line with international
standards, it will not follow the western model of share ownership
completely.
According to the People's Bank official, laws in the pipeline provide for
four classes of shareholder: corporate, worker, local private and
international. Percentages each may own could be prescribed.
China is also unlikely to license the operation of other stock markets in
the immediate future.
Instead, Beijing has authorised the establishment of three national
securities houses to be headquartered in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen.
They will able to open branches in the country's main towns and cities,
thereby allowing local investors a venue to buy and sell stocks.
Furthermore, according to current plans, companies not resident in Shanghai
and Shenzhen will be encouraged to list on either exchange.
Their avenue to do so will be through one of the national securities houses,
which will be controlled by a bank.
As for the lottery system of share distribution, it is likely to stay.
Flawed as it is, officials in the central government see no better way of
distributing company shares.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Democrats seek to dispel potent magic: What Bill Clinton
would like America to think about James Baker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSIDE the Beltway and around the world, James Addison Baker 3rd is a name
mentioned with serious reverence. Beyond Washington's ring road and inside
the nation's boundaries, the perception is less sharp.
But it is this second market that he is now seeking to reclaim, not for the
first time, for George Bush. Not only is he again running the president's
struggling re-election campaign, he has now been requested to shape economic
policy and create a new economic team for a second term, if there is one.
In either fear or recognition, perhaps both, of his reputation, Bill
Clinton's campaign banged out an indictment of Mr Baker within hours of Mr
Bush's mentioning his new role in the first televised debate on Sunday. It
includes subjects rarely mentioned in the polite Washington society that the
current White House chief of staff holds in thrall.
For example, that, as President Reagan's first chief of staff, he was 'the
political mastermind behind efforts to cut taxes for the wealthy and
services for everybody else'; that, as treasury secretary in the second
Reagan term, he 'presided over the most disastrous finance debacle in recent
history - the Dollars 500bn savings and loan scandal'; that, as Bush's
secretary of state, he played 'a central role' in 'the secret policy of aid
to Saddam Hussein'.
It got more personal: that Mr Baker was a notorious frequent user of
military jets while on personal business; that the Baker plan for third
world debt was also designed to protect his own private holdings in a big US
bank; that he is partner in an oil barge business which successfully lobbied
to prevent the enactment of expensive environmental rules.
Mr Baker has not stooped to respond, except for one little incident. Flying
commercially from St Louis, he resisted the invitation from the cabin crew
to move up to first class.
No contemporary public figure, certainly none who has never won an election
and only run once - for Texas attorney-general in 1978 - has commanded such
mystique. To his admirers, who are many, he is the consummate deal-maker
able to work effectively in Washington and from Brussels to Beijing.
To his detractors, who are growing in number, he has the extraordinary
facility to do bad as well as good, but never, never to get the blame for
anything that goes wrong.
Mr Baker, a Houston patrician polished by an Ivy League university,
Princeton, is said to dislike politics. He has admitted he found his 1978
race personally 'distasteful'.
His relationship with Mr Bush goes back 30 years and must be complex. He may
be smarter than his president, and is reported to have no compunction about
ordering him around in private, but is dependent on his patronage. Each, it
seems, serves the other's needs.
In his farewell speech in August to the state department, where he was not
universally admired, he said that he was only leaving - 'one of the most
difficult decisions of my life' - because he believed in the necessity of
global US leadership. He then recited a long list of accomplishments.
By this logic, Mr Baker is only doing what he is now in order to go back to
what he was doing as soon as possible. A short intermission in control of
domestic policy, if the electorate grants that, seems the limit of his
desire.
A reluctance ever to create public hostages to fortune has always been his
trademark, as much in negotiations in the Middle East as in his various
political roles. It explains why some people even speculate that he could be
useful to a President Clinton on some specially-defined mission, if not
immediately, then after the passage of a decent interval. This week's
Democratic indictment of him makes this now a little fanciful.

WEAK retail sales statistics and climbing producer prices yesterday did
nothing to dispel anxiety about the US economy.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose by 0.3 per cent in September
to Dollars 161.1bn. But much of the increase came from sales of building
materials and home furnishings. Economists suggested this was temporary
because of rebuilding after Hurricane Andrew had hit southern Florida.
The producer price index, meanwhile, rose in September by 0.3 per cent from
the previous month, the Labour Department announced, to show year-on-year
wholesale price inflation of 1.6 per cent.
Energy prices rose by 0.8 per cent during September, after small declines in
July and August. Consumer food prices continued to rise, though at a slower
pace than in August.
Consumer goods, without the volatile food and energy components, rose by 0.2
per cent, helped by dearer tobacco.
Prices of intermediate supplies and components rose by 0.2 per cent in
September, to show slower year-on-year inflation of 0.9 per cent.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Mexican ruling party pushed towards reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RARELY can the fortunes of Mexico's two main opposition parties have changed
so rapidly. Humiliated three months ago by a bitter defeat in its former
stronghold, the western state of Michoacan, the leftist Party of Democratic
Revolution (PRD) is now celebrating the forced resignation of the state's
governor last week.
The resignation followed months of PRD protests, marches and sit-ins against
what it claimed were irregularities in an election where the PRD alleged it
was outspent 50:1 by Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party
(PRI), whose governor Mr Eduardo Villasenor has now quit.
The resignation has also pushed political reform to the front of the agenda.
The PRD has had little success in elections but its ability to disrupt them
and make states or municipalities ungovernable has forced the government to
negotiate. For those PRD members to whom deep political reform is more
important than the occasional election win, this is a considerable victory.
Three months ago, while the PRD was lamenting its loss in Michoacan, the
centre-right National Action Party (PAN) was enjoying its victory in the
northern state of Chihuahua, its third governorship in the party's 53 years.
Last week, the costs of that victory became apparent. Nine senior officials
resigned in protest at the party's pro-government line, thereby undermining
its credibility as an opposition.
The nine dissidents included Mr Pablo Emilio Madero, former presidential
candidate, and Mr Bernardo Batiz, former party secretary-general. They
announced they were leaving because of the PAN's support for the PRI and the
authoritarian leadership of the party, under its president Mr Luis H.
Alvarez.
The dissidents are said to be mulling over forming a new, Christian
democratic party, which could further split the anti-government vote. Under
Mr Alvarez, the PAN has supported many government economic reforms, and
voted in favour of new electoral laws which many Mexicans believe did not go
far enough.
The resignation of the governor of Michoacan, who has been replaced by
another PRI official, brought heavy criticism, much of it from outside the
ruling party. The PRD highlighted the unfairnesses of the election in
Michoacan but had failed to demonstrate that fraud affected the result.
In little more than a year, five Mexican governors or governors-elect have
been booted out, three within months of their election. The resignations
have weakened what little confidence there was in Mexico's democratic
institutions.
Mr Federico Reyes Heroles, a political commentator in La Jornada newspaper,
wrote: 'In Michoacan, Mexico is paying the costs of the injustices and
incongruences of barbaric politics that, between hyped announcements of
modernisation, still govern us.' He and others reached the same conclusion:
elections in Mexico are decided in the street, rather than at the ballot
boxes.
The government forced Mr Villasenor to resign, not just because the state
had become ungovernable, but it seems also in the hope his departure would
pave the way for a reconciliation with the PRD.
This week and last, Mr Porfirio Munoz Ledo, number two in the PRD, has been
been meeting the interior minister, Mr Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, to settle
the conditions for municipal elections in Michoacan in December. The PRD is
demanding ceilings on PRI spending and equal access to newspapers and
television.
If, as now seems likely, the PRD were granted such conditions, an electoral
precedent would have been set. Many in the government are opposed to
allowing wider political competition but the Michoacan election fiasco shows
that, without some political reform, opposition protests and demonstrations
can only grow.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VICE-PRESIDENT Dan Quayle has denied that US foreign aid funds, intended to
promote private investment in developing countries, have instead encouraged
the closure of US plants and their relocation to Caribbean basin countries.
The charge, in a study by the New York-based National Labour Committee
Education Fund, has been picked up in recent campaign speeches by Governor
Bill Clinton, Democratic presidential candidate in the US, who has accused
the administration of shipping jobs out of the country.
In the vice-presidential candidates' televised debate on Tuesday night, Mr
Quayle denied that the US had ever 'subsidised any company to move to Latin
America.'
The allegations concern Dollars 1.3bn of funding by the US Agency for
International Development (AID), released under the terms of President
Reagan's Caribbean Basin Initiative, which gave countries in the region
almost total access to the US market.
Voters watching the most popular US television news show, CBS's Sixty
Minutes, last month saw US officials (recorded by hidden cameras) promote
the Caribbean basin for factory sites and even promise that a local
blacklist would guarantee no union organisation.
Mr Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the National Labour Committee,
had set up a dummy US company for the Sixty Minutes news team.
He said a partial survey of the US clothing industry found 30 US
manufacturers with plants in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, as well as
68 others using factories in those countries as sources. Since 1990, the
same companies closed 58 plants in the US, leaving more than 12,000 US
workers jobless.
Since 1983, AID has spent Dollars 289m funding Central American and
Caribbean investment and export promotion organisations. It has denied
subsidising any plant removals, although it has paid for advertising and
promotion which led to them.

<TEXT>
THE Finnish government yesterday announced plans to cut spending by FM54.2bn
(Pounds 6.8bn) over the next three years.
The austerity programme is designed to calm the markets following the
floating of the markka on September 8 and to enable the government to
restore a fixed exchange rate as soon as possible.
Spending cuts of FM5.2bn are planned for next year on top of the FM13bn cuts
already agreed. This is to be followed by FM16bn reductions in 1994 and
FM20bn the subsequent year. This will mean an estimated fall of 3 per cent
in GDP in 1994 and a further 4 per cent the following year.
The government also plans to raise an extra FM3.2bn in taxes next year. It
said the measures would reduce the budget deficit by FM8.4bn in 1993 to
FM50bn.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Airbus chief wants a Nasa for Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOULOUSE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of Airbus Industrie yesterday called for a European equivalent of
the US National Aeronautical and Space Administration (Nasa) to be set up in
order to fund research and development in European commercial aerospace
programmes.
Mr Jean Pierson, the consortium's managing director, said it was crucial for
governments to give greater backing to commercial aircraft programmes at a
time when the US, through Nasa, was increasing support for its aircraft
industry.
Such action had become all the more important with the sharp decline in the
defence business which had traditionally supported research and development
funding in commercial projects.
Mr Pierson suggested that some of the Dollars 800m in launch aid which
Airbus was due to repay this year should go to research and technology
development for future commercial aircraft. 'The Airbus partners (France,
Germany, Britain and Spain) must now invest in the longer-term future,' he
said. 'If you want to survive, you must look ahead and invest.'
Mr Pierson made his proposal as the European consortium rolled out its
latest airliner, the twin-engine, wide-bodied A330. Company officials said
the consortium's operations now directly employed about 60,000 people in
Europe. In the UK alone, 300 companies were working on Airbus business.
Airbus has become increasingly concerned by disagreements among its partners
on significant aerospace projects, especially the European fighter aircraft
(EFA), and new regional aircraft programmes.
They warned that the dispute between Britain and Germany over the future of
the EFA could have serious repercussions on European aerospace collaboration
on the civil side.
Mr Pierson said: 'We must be very careful to remain united in our goal to
build up a successful commercial European aircraft industry if we don't want
to lose out to our American competitors in 10 years' time.'
Airbus this week announced a further scaling down in its aircraft production
rate over the next three years in response to the slump in civil aviation.
It has also delayed the launch of the A319, a shortened version of its A320
twin-engine, 150-seater.
The consortium is expected to show another operating profit this year after
reporting a surplus of about Dollars 250m (Pounds 145.3m) last year. Mr
Pierson said the European partners could not 'just sleep' because of the
commercial success of the consortium which had gained a 26 per cent share of
the world commercial airliner market in the past 20 years.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Aerospatiale to announce 1,000 job cuts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AEROSPATIALE, the French state-owned aerospace company which has a 37.9 per
cent shareholding in Airbus, is expected to announce 1,000 job cuts today as
a result of declining defence helicopter and commercial aircraft business,
writes Paul Betts.
The company's guided weapons business has been badly hit in recent months.
Job losses are also expected at Eurocopter, the joint venture with Deutsche
Aerospace of Germany. The Airbus decision to trim production is also
affecting Aerospatiale's commercial aircraft workload.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Atom-smasher work wins Nobel physics prize
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WINNERS of the Nobel physics and chemistry prizes, announced in
Stockholm yesterday, made discoveries which helped to uncover some of the
most fundamental processes in science.
The physics laureate, Professor Georges Charpak of France, invented the
electronic detector which is now used in all the world's 'atom smashers' to
trace the sub-atomic particles thrown off by high-energy collisions. His
multi-wire proportional chamber makes it possible to collect data 1,000
times faster than the old photographic detection methods, the Swedish
Academy of Sciences said in its citation.
Prof Charpak, 68, works at Cern, the European particle physics laboratory
near Geneva. His detector - invented in the 1960s - was used by colleagues
from Cern who won the 1984 Nobel physics prize for discovering some of the
innermost structure of matter.
Now, simpler versions of the detector are being developed for more practical
applications, for example in detecting medical X-rays.
Professor Rudolph Marcus of the US won this year's chemistry prize for 'his
theory for what is perhaps the simplest chemical elementary process: the
transfer of an electron between molecules,' the academy said.
Prof Marcus, 69, works at the California Institute of Technology in
Pasadena. His theory, developed during the 1950s and 60s, has made useful
predictions in many areas of chemistry, including the way plants fix light
energy in photosynthesis and the conduction of electricity in plastics.
Some predictions conflicted with what chemists had previously expected.
These were not finally confirmed by experiment until the late 1980s.
Prof Charpak is France's ninth physics prize winner and Prof Marcus is the
39th American to win the chemistry prize. Each prize is worth about Dollars
1.2m this year.

Germany wants tomorrow's European Community emergency summit, called to
discuss the future of European integration, to consider new international
aid for war refugees in former Yugoslavia, Reuter reports.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, concerned about a growing racist backlash against up
to 300,000 refugees now in Germany, will urge the EC to earmark more funds
to help house and feed Bosnian refugees in Croatia, Bonn officials said.
Turkey will send about 20,000 tonnes of fuel oil to Bosnia, to help people
face winter conditions under the Serbian siege, the foreign ministry said in
Ankara. It will also set up a 50-bed hospital in Bosnia for victims of the
war, once security could be assured.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Portugal aims to rein back budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Portuguese government yesterday unveiled a tough budget for 1993 aimed
at reducing its deficit to less than 4 per cent of gross domestic product.
Government expenditure will fall in real terms and the public sector be
restructured to cut costs and raise productivity.
The deficit will be reduced from Esc543bn (Pounds 2.4bn), representing over
5 per cent of GDP in 1992, to Esc488bn next year. This will be achieved
without raising taxes but with the help of higher tax revenues due to more
efficient tax collection and through a projected 3 per cent growth in the
economy.
The public sector borrowing requirement will be cut from Esc539bn in 1992 to
Esc416bn next year, and the government expects to benefit from lower
interest rates.
Receipts from privatisations are expected to reach Esc225bn in 1993.
Inflation is forecast to come down from just above 9 per cent this year to
5-7 per cent in 1993. To achieve these targets, the government intends to
cut back on public services and to contain wage rises sharply. Most
ministries will be made to cut recurrent expenditure by 5 per cent.
Negotiations with public sector trade unions have begun, with the government
offering pay rises of up to 5.5 per cent. This has been rejected outright by
the unions which have threatened a general strike if the government does not
improve its offer.
To soften the blow, the government will spend more on social and health
programmes. Investment in infrastructure will also rise, by close to 12 per
cent.

FT  15 OCT 92 / UN prepares for transfer of Serb aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PREPARATIONS were under way yesterday for the rapid transfer of all
Bosnian-Serb combat aircraft to United Nations-monitored airfields in the
rump Yugoslavia, after Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian-Serb leader, agreed
to the measure in Geneva on Tuesday night.
A senior representative of the UN protection force (Unprofor) in the former
Yugoslavia is due in Banja Luka, military headquarters of the Bosnian Serbs,
later this week to arrange the transfer, which has also been agreed by Mr
Milan Panic, the Yugoslav prime minister. The UN representative will be
accompanied by a Yugoslav air force officer.
Mr Karadzic made the offer after being warned by Lord Owen, the EC mediator
on ex-Yugoslavia, that the UN Security Council would move swiftly to enforce
its ban on military flights over Bosnia imposed October 9.
According to intelligence reports available to the UN, Bosnian-Serb aircraft
bombed the Moslem-held city of Gradacac on October 10, flying more than 20
sorties, but have since been grounded. Bosnian-Serb leaders have denied the
Gradacac bombing raids.
Under the terms of the new accord, all military fixed-wing and helicopter
aircraft intended for use in combat and stationed on Bosnian territory will
be transferred to airfields in Serbia and Montenegro, where they will be
monitored by Unprofor observers. UN officials said yesterday they hoped the
aircraft would be moved within the next few days.
Banja Luka is the main airbase for Bosnian-Serb forces, but neither the UN
nor the Bosnian Serbs have revealed the number of aircraft stationed there
or elsewhere in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
UN officials acknowledge that the deal will be a crucial test of whether Mr
Karadzic has, as he claims, full control over Bosnian-Serb commanders in the
field. A spokesman for Lord Owen said yesterday that Mr Karadzic's offer had
been taken up on the understanding that he was 'fully capable to deliver'.
However, the Bosnian-Serb air force commander said on Tuesday night that he
had not been consulted on the proposal to hand over the aircraft.
Lord Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance, the UN mediator, hope Bosnian-Serb compliance
with the UN 'no-fly zone' will help pave the way for broader agreement with
all three factions in the Bosnian conflict on a cessation of hostilities and
the demilitarisation of the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo.
As fighting continued in Bosnia yesterday, Belgrade Radio said Croat forces
were massing north of Brcko, in the north-east, in an attempt to cut the
Serb-held supply line linking Serbia and Serb-controlled territories.
Croatian radio said Serb forces had launched an offensive on Maglaj, south
of the land corridor.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Old-style chief to shape new Ukraine: A PM groomed in the
engine of Stalin's industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR FIVE years Mr Leonid Kuchma has grappled with the mammoth task of
converting the world's largest missile factory to civilian production.
This week, he accepted an even more daunting challenge. As Ukraine's new
prime minister, the energetic, 54-year-old engineer now has the job of
converting the faltering, state-dominated economy of Ukraine, the second
largest republic of the former Soviet Union, to the market.
In his 32-year career at Pivdennyi Mashynobudivnyi Zavod, birthplace of the
infamous SS strategic missile, Mr Kuchma proved an excellent manager of an
old-style Soviet factory. But the very skill which allowed him to churn out
the 'Black Joe' missiles which raised goose bumps in the Pentagon may prove
a liability in his task of integrating a country the size of France into the
world economy.
With his own experience at the receiving end of government largesse, Mr
Kuchma is expected to be sympathetic to the demands of Ukrainian factory
managers, even if the cost is more inflation and a further expansion of the
budget deficit.
Located in the south-eastern Donbass region, the engine of Stalin's rapid
industrialisation and Leonid Brezhnev's birthplace, Pivdenmash was the
gleaming, marble pride of the Soviet military industrial complex with
privileged access to raw materials for its assembly line and luxury goods
for its workers.
But Ukraine's declaration of independence last December and pledge to
renounce nuclear weapons left the factory facing an awful dilemma. Unlike
most former Soviet factories, Pivdenmash makes a world class product, but it
has no buyer: Ukraine does not need missiles and the west is reluctant to
admit newcomers into the lucrative aerospace market.
The factory has made a half-hearted stab at conversion, transforming the
heat chambers for rocket boosters into mobile, high-speed rose petal dryers
and the rocket towers into grain silos. But it survives thanks to the
generous subsidies paid by a government determined to preserve the Ukrainian
space industry as a point of national pride.
This personal experience was echoed in Mr Kuchma's brief policy statement in
which he called for 'evolutionary reforms', a special 'Ukrainian model' of
change and continued government control over the economy.
All indications are that the resignation last month of Mr Vitold Fokin,
independent Ukraine's first prime minister, and Mr Kuchma's subsequent
appointment represent, as one Ukrainian reformer put it, the triumph of the
industrial elite over the Communist party functionaries.
Although on paper the Ukrainian government is committed to a muddled
privatisation plan and a balanced budget, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the president,
has repeatedly insisted that Ukraine will not apply 'shock therapy'. In
practice this has meant the rejection of calls from the Ukrainian central
bank for the sort of tight monetary policy pioneered in Poland and foot
dragging over privatisation.
Instead, Ukraine's ex-communist functionaries have sought to keep the 96 per
cent state-owned economic machine chugging along through the frantic
addition of lubricating government credit.
Between January and August industrial production declined by 10 per cent
compared with the same months last year. But the cabinet predicts that the
decline will slow to 8 per cent by the end of the year and forecasts actual
economic growth of 0.5 per cent in July compared with the previous year. At
the same time, average consumer prices have jumped by 720 per cent compared
with December 1991 and wages by 430 per cent.
Professor Oleksander Savchenko, a leading Ukrainian economist and former
deputy head of the central bank, estimates that inflation is running at
between 30-40 per cent a month and warns of hyper-inflation by the end of
the year. The culprit, in Prof Savchenko's view is a ballooning budget
deficit which he estimates at 20 per cent of gross national product.
These problems are largely the result of the government's habit of solving
economic grievances through enormous, one-off subsidies. For example, when
farmers' criticisms of the government reached a fever pitch in June, Kiev
appeased them by doubling overnight the savings accounts of Ukraine's
collective farms.
In an interview with the French newspaper Le Monde last week, Mr Kravchuk
insisted there was no crisis. The man who has won a place in Ukrainian
history books and in the hearts of Ukrainian nationalists by winning
independence after more than three centuries of Russian domination took
solace in what is becoming Ukraine's favourite consolation.
'Believe me, today things are going badly everywhere and Russia is no
exception. Even in Moscow the former head of the executive of the city
government told me that some people are beginning to die of hunger. That is
not happening here.'

<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S first deputy foreign minister stepped down yesterday in response to
accusations that he was too 'soft' on the Baltics and other former Soviet
republics, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Mr Fyodor Shelov-Kovedyaev said his depature did not signify 'tragic
changes' in Russian diplomacy but was intended to remove a pretext for
conservatives to hinder President Boris Yeltsin's liberal policies.
However, a spokesman for Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi, a leader of the
Civic Union alliance which has demanded the heads of several ministers
including that of Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the foreign minister, said: 'His
resignation is a first step along a path of very serious changes in the
foreign ministry.'
A Latvian representative in Moscow, Mr Igors Graushs, whose republic has
been at loggerheads with Moscow over its treatment of its large Russian
minority and the timing for the withdrawal of Soviet troops, said he feared
the resignation could signal a 'much tougher line on the Baltics'.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Georgia to set up powerful defence council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE LEVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GEORGIA'S ruling state council is to create a defence council with sweeping
powers, in response to the violent clashes with separatist rebels in the
Abkhazia region, local journalists said.
It would have the power to pass decisions that will be 'mandatory for all
organisations and citizens across the state', they said. The eight-man body
would be headed by Georgia's newly elected leader Mr Eduard Shevardnadze.
The state council said the formation of the defence council was caused by 'a
most difficult situation threatening territorial integrity of the country'.
Mr Shevardnadze, elected overwhelmingly as Georgia's leader on Sunday, said
his prime task was to bring order to the country, swept by ethnic unrest.
He said force would be used if needed to quell bloodshed in separatist
Abkhazia, where hundreds of people have been killed in fighting between
government forces and rebels backed by mountain fighters from Russia's
Caucasus region.
Georgia and Abkhazia yesterday appeared to be closer to a battle on the
outskirts of the Abkhaz capital, Sukhumi, a day after the postponement of
talks to end the fighting.
Georgia was reported to be moving tanks, artillery and other armour near the
Gumista river, north of the capital, across which the two sides are facing
each other. The Abkhaz president, Mr Vladislav Ardzinba, said
'counter-measures' would be taken.
'We must liberate our territory from the invaders. But we'd like to do it by
peaceful means,' Mr Ardzinba said in his stronghold of Gudauta, 40 km north
of Sukhumi.
Two Georgian soldiers were reported killed yesterday as separatists tried to
launch an attack on the capital. The Abkhazian side, quoted by Interfax news
agency, said its forces killed at least 30 Georgian troops in fighting on
Tuesday in other parts of the rebel region.
Russian President Boris Yeltsin yesterday gave South Korean officials the
contents of the black box recovered after the Soviet Union shot down a
Korean Airlines jumbo jet in 1983, killing all 269 crew and passengers. Its
existence and contents had been denied by Soviet leaders in the past.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Paris acts on corruption law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government yesterday took action to push an anti-corruption law
through parliament in an attempt to clean up the ruling Socialists' image
before next spring's legislative elections.
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy won cabinet approval to turn final passage
of the law, which in its original draft would ban all corporate
contributions to political parties, into a general vote of confidence in the
government.
Mr Beregovoy can now deem the law to have passed the National Assembly,
unless the opposition brings down the government with a censure motion. This
ruse is largely designed to whip back into line Socialist deputies, who in
Tuesday's initial debate on the anti-corruption law showed themselves as
averse as the opposition to seeing corporate donations to their party
coffers dry up.
French business, since the Socialists first won power in 1981, has been
hedging its bets by giving money to the left as well as the right. Mr
Beregovoy said on Tuesday that the bill was open to amendment, and its
likely thrust will be just to restrict corporate campaign contributions and
to ensure they are made public.
The bill is largely a reaction to the indictment of Mr Henri Emmanuelli, the
National Assembly president, involving alleged irregular fund-raising by the
Socialists. Other elements of the law seek to put an end to the widespread
practice of local politicians receiving backhanders from public contractors
and from companies in search of building and trading permits.
Nearly two-thirds of French voters want Socialist President Francois
Mitterrand to step down if the centre-right opposition wins parliamentary
elections next March, an opinion poll released yesterday showed, Reuter
reports from Paris. The poll, conducted by the BVA organisation for the
weekly Paris-Match, showed 62 per cent of the French wanted him out of
office if, as most polls predict, the Socialists are crushed in March.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EAST Germany's best-known politician, Mr Manfred Stolpe, the prime minister
of Brandenburg state, came under growing pressure yesterday to resign after
allegations that he was awarded a medal by the Stasi security police.
As Mr Stolpe met the leadership of his Social Democratic Party (SPD) in Bonn
to discuss the charges, members of his coalition government in Potsdam
distanced themselves from him and called for his resignation.
Ms Marianne Birthler, minister of education in Brandenburg and a member of
the New Forum party, said the coalition faced a 'major crisis'. Leaders of
the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) said Mr Stolpe had to resign if the latest
allegations were true.
An SPD aide to Mr Stolpe said it was now only a 'question of when' the
premier would be forced to step down.
The latest allegation was made by Mr Klaus Rossberg, a senior Stasi officer,
in a sworn statement to a lawyer. He said he personally gave Mr Stolpe the
medal, the Order of Merit of the former East Germany, in 1978 in a
clandestine Stasi residence. Mr Stolpe denied the charge as slanderous and
said he would take legal steps against Mr Rossberg.
Mr Stolpe has previously admitted receiving the medal but said it was
awarded to him by East Germany's late State Secretary for Church Affairs. He
has repeatedly denied allegations that he was an informer for the Stasi
codenamed 'Secretary' while serving as a senior Protestant Church official.
He acknowledged, however, having frequent talks with Stasi officers to help
East Germans in conflict with the authorities.
Mr Rossberg also claimed that in late 1989, as the communist regime was
crumbling, the Stasi urged Mr Stolpe to act as its vehicle in the
newly-formed Social Democratic party in East Germany. Mr Stolpe has not
responded to this allegation.
Mr Stolpe's departure would be a serious blow to the already battered
self-respect of east Germans who have tended to regard claims that he was a
Stasi informer as part of a west German campaign to denigrate easterners.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Lord Forte hands over to his son but keeps board role

<TEXT>
LORD FORTE, the Italian immigrant and former milk bar proprietor who
established Britain's leading hotel company, announced his retirement as
chairman of Forte yesterday.
He will be succeeded by Mr Rocco Forte, his 47-year-old son, who will add
the title of chairman to the role of chief executive he has held since 1983.
As one of the most notable figures in Britain's post-war business history,
Lord Forte will not easily be forgotten - partly because he is not quite
going.
Lord Forte, 84 next month, will become president and continue to serve on
the board. Mr Forte said he would continue to ask his father for advice when
necessary.
The company has appointed two new non-executive directors. Sir Anthony
Tennant, who retires as chairman of Guinness at the end of this year,
becomes deputy chairman. The other new director is Sir Paul Girolami,
chairman of Glaxo Holdings.
The City welcomed the appointment of two respected, independent figures to
the board.
There was widespread disappointment, however, that the company did not bring
in an outsider as either chairman or chief executive, allowing Mr Forte to
take the remaining role.
Mr Paul Slattery, an analyst with stockbroker Kleinwort Benson, said the
group needed to move away from the culture created by Lord Forte. Among the
changes needed, he said, were greater decentralisation and the granting of
more autonomy to hotel managers.
Mr Rocco Forte defended his assumption of the positions of both chairman and
chief executive. Forte is trying to sell its Gardner Merchant contract
catering subsidiary, which would leave it with two large businesses - hotels
and restaurants. Mr Forte said both would be headed by strong managing
directors, so there was no need to have a separate group chief executive.
He said, however, that impending retirements would enable him to make
further board changes. He denied that, with his father remaining as
president, he would not be in control. 'Being chairman, you have a certain
responsibility to the shareholders. The buck stops with me now, doesn't it?'

FT  15 OCT 92 / Greenspan warns on severity of downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Japan face an economic downturn of a kind unseen since 1945 which
could prove more protracted than previous recessions this century, Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the US Federal Reserve Board, warned yesterday.
Mr Greenspan, speaking to the Federation of Bankers' Associations of Japan,
warned that if a recession was marked by a steep fall in asset prices,
recovery would take longer and be more modest. There had not been a
recession with this characteristic since the second world war.
He cautioned his audience not to expect a surge in economic growth once an
economy started to adjust to a sharp drop in real estate and asset prices.
His remarks run sharply counter to the consensus among many Tokyo financiers
and economists that the Japanese economy will recover from the middle of
next year to grow at close to 3 per cent compared with about 1.5 per cent
this year.
Mr Greenspan said the US - and to some extent Japan - as well as Britain,
Australia and the Scandinavian countries were confronting asset deflation
which policymakers had little experience in predicting or correcting.
He said old economic models that policymakers had used to guide their
actions have been rendered less valuable by the unusual decline in asset
values.
'A number of the old rules of thumb that policymakers used are inoperative,'
he said.
Asked whether the US was an 'economic basket case' because successive
interest rate cuts had failed to revive the economy, he argued that the cuts
had not been made to encourage growth but to ease the debt burden.
'Since 1989, the Fed has engaged in a series of interest rate reductions,
the purpose was to facilitate the adjustment process . . . to stretch it out
into a prolonged period of time so society does not become strained.'
He added that the debt overhang was a limited problem, not a long-term
structural problem.
Mr Greenspan's visit comes as the Japanese economy is on the verge of a
recession, with consumption stagnant after sustained falls in asset prices
which have hit balance sheets. He stressed that there were significant
differences between the US and Japan, such as the lower level of personal
debt in Japan, which meant the process would take a different course in the
two economies.
He said it was too early to say whether Japanese banks struggling with a
rising tide of non-performing loans would need an institution such as the
publicly funded US Resolution Trust Corporation, which was set up to deal
with the collapse of savings and loans small financial institutions.
Mr Greenspan said that while it might be useful for aspects of the RTC to be
studied, the model could not be easily transferable from the US to Japan.

A NATIONWIDE wave of pro-tests hit the government yesterday over its drastic
programme of pit closures as several Conservative MPs openly criticised
Tuesday's announcement of the loss of 30,000 coalminers' jobs.
With ministers braced for a sharp increase in unemployment figures today,
Tory backbenchers joined church leaders and unions to charge Mr John Major's
administration with insensitivity and a failure to grasp the human
dimensions of the recession.
As the public furore grew, the government suffered a new blow when the
European Commission turned down a request for an extra Pounds 24.7m to help
mining regions hit by the shutdowns.
The depth and savagery of the cuts in the British coal industry also
provoked nearly unanimous condemnation from usually loyal Conservative
newspapers.
In a full-page editorial, the Daily Express accused ministers of 'drifting
aimlessly' and being 'too little concerned' by the rising rate of business
failures. 'Above all, we deserve and require leadership,' it said.
Coming in the wake of job losses at Lucas Industries and Vickers' failure to
win a Pounds 1bn tank order from Kuwait, many critics targeted the prime
minister for failing to tackle the recession with sufficient urgency. Lord
Ridley, former trade and industry secretary, warned that without 'drastic'
cuts in interest rates the country faced a slump worse than that of the
1930s.
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, Conservative MP for the Yorkshire seat of Batley and
Spen, called for the reversal of the pit closures, saying dependence on
imports was 'strategically dangerous' for the long-term health of the
econ-omy. Mr John Carlisle, Tory MP for Luton North, said that, in
devastating the lives of thousands, the government was showing it was 'not
fit to govern'.
Churchmen added their protests with the Bishop of Sheffield describing the
cuts as 'wicked' and Dr John Habgood, the Archbishop of York, condemning
them as 'economic madness'.
The closures have fuelled a growing clamour for a new industrial policy
alongside demands for the resignation of Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor.
Such sentiments were widely voiced at a small business conference in Surrey
yesterday despite efforts by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, and Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, to stress the
need for competitiveness and the recession's international dimensions.
Meanwhile, Mr Tim Eggar, the coal minister, resisted calls to reconsider the
closures. 'It was an appalling decision to have to make, but it is a
completely unavoidable decision,' he said, ruling out any reversal.
Labour seized on the tide of protest, warning that the pit closures would
mean the loss of as many as 50,000 more jobs in related industries at an
additional cost to the Treasury of some Pounds 650m.
Party officials said they would press for a statement when the Commons
returned on Monday and would use opposition parliamentary time to debate the
issue later in the week. Mr John Smith, the party leader, denounced the cuts
as 'senseless economics and energy madness'.
Labour officials now believe the government is caught in an intractable
dilemma. Either it can hold firm and slash public expenditure, thereby
breaching at least some of its manifesto commitments, or it must make a
policy U-turn and take up Labour proposals for an employment action
programme and incentives for industry.
Many Conservative MPs privately share this analysis, adding that an
alternative option - tax increases - may be the only solution, although this
too would be in contravention of the party's election promises.

FT  15 OCT 92 / TUC acts to rally opposition to British Coal plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress last night called an emergency meeting of its
general council for Saturday morning to try to give a lead to widespread
union and public opposition to British Coal's plan to close 31 of its 50
pits.
The executive of the National Union of Mineworkers has called for a
demonstration on Friday outside the pits earmarked for closure and for a
mass lobby of parliament.
'We call on all our members and their families to demonstrate at the pits to
stop these immediate closures,' said Mr Arthur Scargill, NUM leader.
Today a special delegate conference of the NUM will almost certainly back a
call by the union's executive for a strike ballot against the closures.
There is considerable doubt as to whether NUM members will support the
strike call, which would jeopardise redundancy payments of up to Pounds
37,000. It is even less likely that friendly unions will challenge the
government's employment laws and take unlawful industrial action to support
the miners.
However, Mr Jimmy Knapp, leader of the RMT rail union, after a meeting with
NUM leaders, said the direct effect of pit closures on railwaymen could be
so severe that 'the prospect of industrial action is left open'.
Some union militants have even called for a link-up between the fight
against pit closures and the public sector unions battle against a possible
pay freeze in the public sector.
But TUC officials acknowledge that the only real weapons that the unions
have are public opinion and the courts. Mr Norman Willis, general secretary
of the TUC, yesterday called for a 'cooling off' period while the future of
Britain's energy industry could be considered.
'I do not think the government should underestimate the intensity of the
anger at this situation,' he added. Mr Willis also said the TUC switchboard
was jammed yesterday morning with members of the public expressing outrage
at the closures.
Union leaders and Labour politicians estimate that at least 50,000
additional jobs could be lost as a result of the pit closures.
The Union of Democratic Mineworkers, the Nottinghamshire-based union which
broke away from the NUM during the 1984-85 strike, is preparing to apply for
an injunction to stop the immediate closures. The NUM and the UDM are not,
however, likely to bury their differences and unite to fight the closures.
The UDM's solicitors argue that the speed of closure is unlawful -
disregarding both British Coal's own colliery review procedure and the
Employment Protection Act 1975 which requires 90 days' notice of closure.
The union is also considering filing a complaint to the European Community
over the recent gas supply agreement and alleging an abuse of monopoly power
by the electricity industry.
The UDM is unlikely to win an injunction which would prevent any closures
before a full hearing could take place, but it hopes for a full hearing
within a fortnight.
Nacods, the pit supervisors' union, is also thinking of applying for an
injunction against the suspension of the colliery review procedure.

FT  15 OCT 92 / International Company News: General Electric reports advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric, the diversified US holding company, reported a 6.5 per
cent increase in third-quarter net income, with strong growth in businesses
such as financial services and aerospace outweighing lower profits in white
goods and power systems and losses at its NBC broadcasting subsidiary.
The group reported net earnings of Dollars 1.11bn, or Dollars 1.30 a share,
compared with Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars 1.20, in the third quarter of last
year. Revenues rose from Dollars 14.6bn to Dollars 15.5bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said GE's productivity growth had continued at an
annual rate of about 5 per cent and he was confident of another year of
record earnings.
However, the operating margin declined from 9.6 per cent a year ago to 9.1
per cent. This was more than accounted for by two unusual factors - higher
restructuring charges and the 1992 Olympic Games, which NBC lost money
covering.
The figures included a gain from a realignment of the equity positions of GE
and Ericsson in their mobile communications venture, which was more than
offset by restructuring charges.
GE's financial services businesses produced net earnings up by 17 per cent.
GE Capital saw double-digit earnings growth, led by commercial equipment
financing and private label credit cards. Kidder Peabody, its securities
house, achieved 'sharply improved 1992 results'.
Aerospace had a 'good increase' in operating profit on higher revenues,
mainly due to sales timing, product mix and productivity gains.
Aircraft engines had flat operating profits, with productivity gains
offsetting a weakness in spare part sales and falling military engine
shipments.
For the nine months, GE made Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars 3.17bn, before
the effects of a one-time accounting change taken in the first quarter.

FT  15 OCT 92 / People: Ogilvy steps up at Hypo F&amp;C
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial Group is reshuffling its top management to reflect
the change in composition of its business. But the moves give no clue as to
who will take over at the top of one of the UK's faster growing fund
management companies when the current team bows out.
The changes, in the spirit of a company that has always been run along
collegiate lines, are prompted by the retirement of Oliver Dawson, on
reaching 61, from the double role as chairman of the holding company Hypo
Foreign &amp; Colonial Management and the management company Foreign &amp; Colonial
Management (FCM).
James Ogilvy (right), 58, chief executive of the holding company, takes on
the role of its chairman as well.
Michael Hart, 59, who manages the Pounds 1.1bn F&amp;C investment trust, and who
has indicated he wishes to continue until he is 65, tops off his 37-year
career at the company by stepping up from deputy chairman to chairman of the
management company. 'This gives him far greater authority to hold sway on
decisions that affect FCM,' according to Ogilvy. Dawson meanwhile continues
as chief investment officer of FCM, and as a director of the investment
trust.
Ogilvy, who points out that he has not managed money for 15 years, says his
experience is in running and building the business, in contrast to Hart who
is seen as the investment guru. Group funds under management in the past
five years have nearly trebled to Pounds 6bn and Ogilvy believes the bulk of
growth prospects also lies outside the UK; he therefore wants to devote more
of his time to developing that side of the group.
Having put together the 50/50 joint venture with Hypo Bank in Munich shortly
after he arrived from Mercury Asset Management, Ogilvy has created a
partnership that is working well, with Hypo Bank, for instance, giving F&amp;C
more than DM5bn of funds to manage. This is in marked contrast to many of
the foreign bank involvements with UK fund managers, notably the Societe
Generale purchase of Touche Remnant which is now unravelling.
As for the succession, Ogvilvy admits that 'I think I know what is going to
happen five years down the line,' but he will give away nothing. 'I don't
think even in an industrial company you would get indications of the
succession yet.'
*****
David Triesman has been appointed general secretary of the 31,000-strong
Association of University Teachers. Triesman's new job will not be a radical
departure for him, since he has spent nearly 12 years working for Natfhe,
the public sector lecturers' union, most recently as national negotiating
secretary.
Besides, Triesman put aside radical departures when the 1968 student
revolution came to an end. Rumoured to have been a student leader, he is a
little evasive about his precise role in events, although he admits to
prominence. He took part in a bid to stop a government recruitment drive for
biological warfare scientists at Essex University, where he read social
science.
Following a postgraduate degree, he embarked on a career as an academic, but
has eschewed the sandals-with-socks-and-brown-rice style of boffin in favour
of what colleagues describe as sartorial elegance.
For instance, when some years ago, national negotiations were on the point
of breaking down, a pink-pullovered Triesman took time out to change into a
grey suit. He told fellow negotiators he did not think pink suitable attire
for collapsing talks.
Triesman combines a love of football - he is a Spurs fan and was once a
semi-professional player - with an extensive art collection. He believes he
owns the largest collection of works by marine and river artist William
Wyllie.
He replaces Diana Warwick who resigned to become the first chief executive
of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTDEUTSCHE Landesbank Girozentrale (WestLB), the Dusseldorf-based public
sector bank, has made its second large purchase in the European travel
sector.
Together with LTU - Germany's largest airline charter group, in which WestLB
has a large stake - the bank is taking an indirect holding in Touristik
Union International (TUI), Europe's largest tour operator. WestLB and LTU
recently took control of the Thomas Cook travel group.
In a move which was greeted with hostility by the state government of Lower
Saxony, where TUI is based, WestLB, LTU and Sudwestdeutsche LB, the
Landesbank for Baden-Wurttemberg, are buying a majority stake in Walter Kahn
Verwaltungs, a holding company which owns 30.2 per cent of TUI.
The deal falls short of WestLB's original aim to buy the entire 30.2 per
cent stake, but the bank and its associates are likely to increase their
stake over time. No price was given, but the three companies are likely to
have spent around DM150m (Dollars 102m), the bank having offered DM300m for
the whole stake.

FT  15 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Indian alumina export project
planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BHUBANESWAR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL ALUMINIUM Company (Nalco), India's largest producer of aluminium,
is to set up an export-oriented alumina (aluminium oxide) project for which
it has entered into a collaboration with Hydro Aluminium of Norway.
The feasibility report of the proposed 900,000 tonne capacity alumina
refinery will be ready by March 1993, according to Mr SN Johri chairman of
Nalco. The company would promote a joint venture to put up the refinery,
which would require an investment of at least Dollars 800m.
According to Mr Johri, an energy deficit country like India having the
world's fifth largest reserves of bauxite (aluminium ore) should be
concentrating on the export of alumina instead of aluminium. Many in the
industry and the government believe that in the long term India should
export alumina and import the metal.
India has an estimated bauxite reserve of 2,900m tonnes. Indian Aluminium
and Larsen &amp; Toubro are also planning to set up export-oriented alumina
projects.
The natural location for the Nalco unit is the Koraput district of Orissa,
as the refinery will obtain bauxite from the existing mines of Nalco. The
implementation of the project will take about four years.
Nalco has been exporting alumina since 1988. In the year to March 1992, its
export of alumina amounted to 379,600 tonnes, while the export target for
the current year is 420,000 tonnes. Mr Johri is confident that in spite of
the continuing world recession, Nalco should be able to export over 80,000
tonnes of aluminium in the current year, compared with 61,000 tonnes in
1991-92. The company has already been able to book export orders for more
than 60,000 tonnes at an average price of Dollars 1,370 a tonne. Hindalco is
to export another 20,000 tonnes.
India has become an aggressive seller in the world market as the expected
production of 520,000 tonnes of aluminium in 1992-93 will be at least 75,000
tonnes more than the domestic requirement. The problem has been compounded
by the fact that the present year opened with stocks of 50,000 tonnes. There
will be a marked rise in Nalco's exports next year when it starts
international marketing of wire rod.
Nalco is the only Indian producer whose aluminium has won London Metal
Exchange recognition.
Mr Johri thinks that domestic demand for aluminium should improve next year
as the electricity companies start creating new capacities. In India, the
electrical sector accounts for more than 40 per cent of aluminium
consumption.
It is thought that by the turn of the century, India will have a shortage of
more than 400,000 tonnes of aluminium. Against this background, Nalco is
seeking government approval for a Rs30bn (Pounds 530m) expansion programme.
According to the detailed project report, bauxite mining capacity will be
doubled to 4.8m tonnes with alumina refining capacity rising to 1.35m tonnes
from 800,000 tonnes and aluminium smelting capacity to 345,000 tonnes from
218,000 tonnes. Power generation is forecast to rise to 960 Mw from 720 Mw.
In addition, a 36,000 tonne capacity semi-fabrication unit will be built.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSHARE, an organisation which aims to encourage wider share ownership,
launched an association for private investors yesterday, with an
introductory offer of a free half-hour consultation with a stockbroker.
The annual subscription is Pounds 30 and the association aims to provide
investors with independent information and to act as a mouthpiece for
private shareholders.
The number of private investors in the UK was about 3m when the
Conservatives came into office in 1979. It is now about 10m, much of it in
the form of small holdings in privatised stocks. The proportion of the
market owned by private investors is less than 20 per cent, compared with
nearly 70 per cent in 1957.
ProShare argues that a combination of investor ignorance, tax disadvantages
and a shortage of good-quality advice has been a barrier to wider share
ownership. The organisation has received funding of more than Pounds 3m from
the Department of Trade and Industry, the Stock Exchange and leading
companies. It hopes to become self-financing.
Members of the association will receive a handbook, a monthly newsletter and
a voucher for eight free copies of the Saturday edition of the Financial
Times.

CHRISTIE'S in Glasgow yesterday sold a run of rare Chelsea Football Club
programmes for Pounds 22,000, double the estimate.
The programmes were sold by Mr David Mears, a descendant of the club's

Such a complete run of programmes, gathered into 69 bound volumes, is
unprecedented. Programmes dating from before 1914 are very rare and the
collection included more than 400 of them, plus more than 1,000 pre-1939
programmes. The successful telephone bidder intends to keep the collection
intact.
The auction did very well, topping Pounds 167,000.

FT  14 OCT 92 / UK government should resume Britain's membership of Unesco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MALCOLM HARPER and Dr MAURICE GOLDSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Why is the UK not a member of the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organisation (Unesco)? Having withdrawn from the
agency in 1985, citing concern about management and aspects of programme
activity, the UK government can no longer justify Britain's continued
absence.
Unesco has greatly reformed in the last seven years and progress has been
made on every point of dissatisfaction put forward at the time of
withdrawal. The Foreign Office has repeatedly stated its commitment to the
ideals and principles embodied in Unesco's constitution and in a recent
adjournment debate, foreign office minister Douglas Hogg acknowledged the
reforms, declaring that the government now has 'a genuinely open mind' on
the issue. Yet still there is no move to return.
Such recalcitrance may be due to the expected Pounds 7m cost of resumed
membership. However, in 1984, UK-related receipts from lucrative contracts
and consultancies from Unesco exceeded the UK's direct budgetary
contribution. Future membership costs would certainly be offset by indirect
income.
The UK was a founder member of Unesco; the first director-general, Sir
Julian Huxley, was British and the constitution is lodged at the British
Foreign Office. Our continued absence from the international exchange
fostered by Unesco restricts and isolates the UK and does incalculable
damage to our reputation abroad.
Foreign Office observers will attend the current session of the executive
board - Unesco's ruling body - which ends on October 31. We urge the
government to resume membership after this.

Net income rose to Dollars 425.7m, with earnings per share increasing by 20
per cent to 53 cents. Sales were up by 16 per cent at Dollars 5.64bn.
PepsiCo said all its main lines of business showed 'solid double-digit
growth'.
Sales advanced by 11 per cent on the beverage side, with operating profits
improving by 20 per cent; in snack foods the figures were 23 and 93 per cent
respectively; and in the restaurants division, there was a 15 per cent sales
gain and a 17 per cent advance in operating profits.
Sales and profit growth was primarily driven by acquisitions which included
buy-outs of the company's joint venture partners at Hostess Frito-Lay
(Canada) and Arnotts (Australia).
Profits for the first nine months of the year were Dollars 1.1bn after tax,
30 per cent up on the same period in 1991.

FT  14 OCT 92 / People: Grice leaves Dales for Wace
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wace, the pre-press and specialist printing group rocked by the departure of
its managing director John Clegg in January, has, after an eight-month
search, found a new chief executive in Trevor Grice, who resigned from
engineering group Renold earlier this year.
Frans ten Bos, chairman, describes it as a 'critical' appointment for Wace.
'It was hard for the City and others to perceive Wace without John Clegg.
John Clegg was a high profile young star.' Grice, by contrast, is 'someone
with different skills and attitudes in a different economic climate. He is
very sparky and shrewd.'
Ten Bos, who was non-exec-utive chairman when Clegg resigned and 'had no
option but to agree to fill in (by taking executive responsibilities) while
the company tried to sort itself out' will return to his non-executive
position when Grice comes aboard in the second week of November.
Since Clegg's departure, the DTI has been investigating share dealings in
the names of some of Clegg's relatives. But ten Bos stresses that 'it is not
Wace that is being investigated. I have no concerns whatsoever about the
outcome', adding that he understands the investigation is coming to an end.
Echoing ten Bos's confidence, Grice contends: 'It is nothing to do with the
company; I don't regard it as an issue.'
Grice, 51, has 14 years' experience of the printing industry under his belt
with lithographic plate-maker Frank Horsell, where he was managing director
between 1978 and 1986. After Horsell was acquired by the Cookson Group,
Grice moved over to Renold, embarking on a five-year plus restructuring
exercise. Despite recent losses stemming from an order book badly dented by
the recession, Grice was confident he had completed his brief and stepped
down from Renold at the end of March - thereby ridding himself of a 140-mile
commute across the Pennines.
He has spent the intervening period on a management consultancy project for
his family telephone sales business. He says he was not actively looking for
another job when he was approached by Wace. After his wife agreed to move to
London from the Yorkshire Dales, he accepted the assignment.

FT  14 OCT 92 / International Company News: Euroc earnings tumble 75% to
SKr27m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROC, the Swedish building materials group, yesterday reported a 75 per
cent fall in profits to SKr27m (Dollars 4.88m) for the first eight months,
due to a sharp decline in its main markets and stiffer price competition,
writes Christopher Brown-Humes.
Sales fell to SKr6.19bn from SKr6.91bn, mainly reflecting lower sales in
Sweden and the UK. The company suffered an extraordinary loss of SKr270m on
the July sale of its stake in Valenciana, the Spanish cement and ready-mix
company.
This meant the group made an overall pre-tax loss of SKr243m for the period,
compared with a SKr260m profit in the first eight months of 1991.
The group is implementing a rationalisation programme to counter the impact
of depressed markets, and expects to cut its 1992 fixed costs by around
SKr330m.

talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITAS, the Finnish holding company of the Union Bank of Finland, has
abandoned negotiations to buy Skopbank from the government's bank guarantee
fund.
The news leaves Skopbank's fate looking increasingly uncertain.
Unitas was the last of those which had shown in interest in buying the bank
still to be in discussions.
The move also surprised banking analysts, who had believed the talks were
going well as recently as last week.
Unitas declined to say why the talks had broken down.
The banking group had hoped that the proposed purchase would eventually lead
to a broader collaboration with some of Finland's savings banks, as Skopbank
is the central bank in the savings bank system.
Skopbank, which was the country's fourth-largest bank, had to be rescued by
the Bank of Finland in September 1991 to prevent it collapsing.
In June, the Bank of Finland sold its holding in Skopbank to the government
guarantee fund.

FT  14 OCT 92 / C&amp;J Clark compromise planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS at C&amp;J Clark were last night working on a compromise agreement to
end the two-month-long row at Britain's largest shoe manufacturer.
The compromise could come in time to avert the extraordinary general meeting
called by four board members to unseat Clark chairman Mr Walter Dickson.
A 10-point proposal was put forward by the rebel directors yesterday
afternoon which would leave Mr Dickson and non-executive director Mr James
Power in position.
If agreement is reached, the EGM is likely - at the very least - to be
postponed until the annual meeting in April.
Solicitors and directors were working to reach a compromise by this evening
 -the latest the company could warn its 4,000 shareholders around the UK
that the EGM had been cancelled.
The compromise proposed by the requisitionists - so named for calling the
EGM - made postponement of the meeting conditional on several points. These
are believed to include the formation of an independent bid committee,
chaired by an executive other than Mr Dickson, to review any future offer
for Clark. The condition was made in light of the talks over a possible bid
by management consultant Mr Colin Fisher backed by Electra Investment Trust,
who said Mr Dickson and Mr Power would remain if a bid succeeded.
The requisitionists are also believed to have set out conditions for the
conduct of any future dispute between directors of the company.
The row has thrown Clark, based in Street, Somerset, and controlled by an
extended Quaker family, into the glare of publicity. Both sides have hired
advisers for the dispute, incurring heavy costs in a company with falling
profits. In August, the chairman warned that pre-tax profits would be lower
than last year's Pounds 20.4m and the interim dividend was cut from 3.5p to
1.75p.
The proposals are also believed to include a suggestion to devolve power
within the board. One of the areas of friction has been the increasing
influence of non-family members on the board. Mr Dickson is only the second
non-family member to chair the 167-year-old firm.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DISNEY, the US entertainment and leisure group, plans to reduce the
financial pressure on Euro Disney, which operates the theme park on the
outskirts of Paris, by renegotiating part of the agreement between the
companies.
Euro Disney, 49 per cent-owned by the US group, has been clouded by
speculation about low attendances and sales since EuroDisneyland opened in
April. The park attracted 7m visitors in its first six months, but is
expected to fall below its original target of 11m for the first year.
Mr Michael Eisner, Disney's chairman, said his company could 'do all sorts
of different things to help Euro Disney. We are not going to allow a project
as important as Euro Disney to suffer'.
Disney receives a management fee of 3 per cent of turnover, together with
royalties of 10 per cent on admissions and 5 per cent on catering and
merchandise.
Euro Disney is also committed to paying an incentive fee to Disney when
operating profits reach an agreed level. It must pay 30 per cent of
operating profits above FFr1.6bn (Pounds 186m), 40 per cent above FFr2.4bn
and 50 per cent above FFr3.2bn.
Mr Eisner said Disney was prepared to be 'flexible'. He said the management
fee and royalties would remain intact, but Disney could 'defer other
payments'. This suggests Disney might renegotiate the incentive fee, which
is expected to be payable from next year.
Analysts are concerned about Euro Disney's ability to finance the second
phase of EuroDisneyland, fuelling speculation that it may have to raise
further funds.
Mr Eisner confirmed that EuroDisneyland would be 'a few hundred thousand
below' its initial attendance forecast. Euro Disney is taking steps to
improve attendance. A priority is to encourage people to visit at off-peak
times.
Euro Disney's prospects have also been clouded by the postponement of its
property development programme because of the downturn in French property.
Its property income was intended to help finance the second phase of
EuroDisneyland.
Ms Rebecca Winnington-Ingram, European leisure industry analyst at Morgan
Stanley, suggests Euro Disney will incur a net loss of FFr216m this
financial year, with another deficit of FFr185m next year, before breaking
even in the following year.

CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr Jacques Delors, the president of

must press ahead together in ratifying the Maastricht treaty on European
union.
At the same time they agreed that the Community must show it is ready to

member states.
The two met for an extraordinary two-hour session in Bonn. 'Birmingham must
produce a clear signal of cohesion and confidence that Europe will continue

Germany is strongly supporting initiatives to strengthen the transparency of
EC decision-making, and the need for maximum 'subsidiarity'.

<TEXT>
ALCAN Aluminium reported a loss of USDollars 14m, or 6 cents a share, in the
third quarter because of depressed ingot and fabricated products prices.
A year earlier Alcan just about broke even after a 14 cents a share
provision for restructuring charges.
Until the persistent oversupply in primary metal is corrected, said Mr David
Morton, chairman, 'there is not much room for any near-term improvement in
prices'.
The spot price for primary aluminium yesterday equalled about 52.7 US cents
per lb or below Alcan's breakeven point. The price has fallen steadily from
a summer peak of about 60 US cents.
Third quarter revenues were USDollars 1.97bn, about unchanged from a year
earlier.
For the first nine months, Alcan's loss was USDollars 63m or 28 cents a
share, against a loss of USDollars 15m, or 7 cents, a year earlier, on
revenues of USDollars 5.8bn against USDollars 5.97bn.
Fabricated products were 66 per cent of total third-quarter volume, up from
62 per cent a year earlier. Ingot shipments were lower. However Alcan was on
target with cost-cutting at its primary smelters. Ingot production costs
were USDollars 100 a tonne lower, year on year.

SHAREHOLDERS of Pohang Iron and Steel (Posco), the South Korean steelmaker,

cent of the state-affiliated company.
Individual foreign investors will not be allowed to have a shareholding of
more than 1 per cent under the amended by-law, which takes effect today. The
Korean government, which controls 35 per cent of Posco, opened the company
to foreign investment to try to revive the country's stock market by
attracting more capital from abroad.
The extraordinary shareholders' meeting also approved the appointment of Mr
Hwang Kyung-ro, the vice-chairman, as Posco's chairman. He replaces Mr Park
Tae-joon, who resigned last week for political reasons and becomes honorary
chairman.
Mr Chung Myung-sik, Posco president, is the new vice-chairman, while Mr Park
Tuk-pyo, vice-president for strategic planning, becomes president.
Mr Hwang said his goal was to make Posco the world's biggest steelmaker by
1996.

PFIZER, one of the largest US drug companies, yesterday posted an 8 per cent
improvement in third quarter net income to Dollars 297.5m, or 88 cents a
share, on sales which rose 3 per cent to Dollars 1.83bn.
This compares with earnings of Dollars 274.7m, or 81 cents, on sales of
Dollars 1.77bn a year earlier.
The company said sales from ongoing operations advanced 16 per cent in the
latest quarter, while net income from ongoing operations rose 19 per cent,
excluding businesses which were sold or closed in 1991 and 1992.
Pfizer's pharmaceutical sales climbed 21 per cent in the quarter. The
company is benefiting from a number of new products, which should help drive
sales and earnings growth.
During the third quarter, Pfizer received approval to market Norvasc, a
cardiovascular agent.
Other new products approved this year include Zoloft, for depression, and
Zithromax, an antibiotic.
For the first nine months, Pfizer had net income of Dollars 796.4m, or
Dollars 2.36, on sales of Dollars 5.28bn, against earnings of Dollars
721.2m, or Dollars 2.13, on sales of Dollars 5.1bn in the same period of

<TEXT>
MAYBELLINE, the US cosmetics company which was acquired two years ago by
Wasserstein Perella, the New York-based investment banking business, may be
coming to the stock market.
The company, based in Memphis, Tennessee, yesterday filed a registration
statement for 3.145m common shares with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission - a move which, by a privately-owned company, usually presages a
flotation.
According to the filing, the company estimates that the net proceeds of the
offering would be around Dollars 65m, and would be used to prepay a portion
of the a term loan outstanding under the company's bank credit agreement.
Merrill Lynch and Wasserstein Perella Securities are underwriters for the
potential offering, and have an option to purchase another 555,000 shares to
over-allotments.
However, Mr Robert Hiatt, Maybelline's president and chief executive, last
night declined to be drawn on the timing of the potential initial public
offering (the US term for a flotation).
Maybelline was bought by Wasserstein's Dollars 1.1bn merchant banking fund
in 1990 from Schering-Plough, the large drugs group. It has been one of the
most successful constituents of the fund, which is dominated by a 40 per
cent stake in Isosceles, the troubled British food retailer.
Wasserstein paid around Dollars 300m for the cosmetics business, after an
earlier deal with MBP Acquisition Corp, a consortium which included Playtex
Family Products, fell through. At the time, Maybelline was making operating
profits of around Dollars 30m on sales of approximately Dollars 300m.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Paper, the large US forest products group, yesterday unveiled
a 4.8 per cent decline in underlying third quarter earnings, reflecting the
continuing pressure of weak economic growth on prices.
Net income for the three months ended September 30 was Dollars 98m, or 81
cents a share, including an extraordinary loss of Dollars 2m, or 1 cent a
share. A year earlier, International Paper earned Dollars 105m, or 95 cents.
The number of shares outstanding increased to 122.2m at the end of the 1992
quarter from 110.7m last year, mainly as a result of an equity offering
earlier this year.
Sales in the latest quarter rose 6 per cent to Dollars 3.5bn from Dollars
3.3bn.
Mr John Georges, chairman and chief executive, blamed price deterioration in
uncoated printing and writing papers in US and European markets for a
decline in earnings between the second and third quarters this year.
For the first nine months, International Paper had net income of Dollars
312m, or Dollars 2.58 a share, on sales of Dollars 10.2bn, against earnings
of Dollars 333m, or Dollars 3.02, excluding an accounting change, on sales
of Dollars 9.5bn.
The results were largely in line with expectations and shares in
International Paper gained Dollars 1 3/8 to close at Dollars 62 7/8 .
Boise Cascade, another US forest products group, suffered a third-quarter
deficit but said it had reduced its underlying losses.
For the three months to September 30, the company recorded a net deficit of
Dollars 35.2m, or Dollars 1.11 a share, compared with Dollars 14.3m, or 47
cents. Excluding extraordinary items, Boise lost Dollars 1.24 a share last
year.
Sales fell to Dollars 935m in the quarter from Dollars 1bn last time.
Like International Paper, Idaho-based Boise is still being hit by weak paper
prices. Boise said, however, that there were some signs of improvement.
Mr John Fery, chairman and chief executive, said order backlogs in pulp and
paper were relatively firm and the company had announced price increases in
some key grades.
Shares in Boise added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 yesterday.

third-quarter advance
</HEADLINE>

   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric, the diversified US holding company, yesterday reported a
6.5 per cent increase in third-quarter net income, with strong growth in
businesses such as financial services and aerospace outweighing lower
profits in white goods and power systems and losses at its NBC broadcasting
subsidiary.
The group reported net earnings of Dollars 1.11bn, or Dollars 1.30, a share,
compared with Dollars 1.04bn, or Dollars 1.20 a share, in the third quarter
of last year.
Revenues rose from Dollars 14.6bn to Dollars 15.5bn.
Mr Jack Welch, chairman, said GE's productivity growth had continued at an
annual rate of about 5 per cent and he was confident of another year of
record earnings.
However, the operating margin declined from 9.6 per cent a year ago to 9.1
per cent. This was more than accounted for by two unusual factors - higher
restructuring charges and the 1992 Olympic Games, which NBC lost money
covering.
The figures included a gain from a realignment of the equity positions of GE
and Ericsson in their mobile communications venture, which was more than
offset by restructuring charges.
GE's financial services businesses produced net earnings up by 17 per cent.
GE Capital saw double-digit earnings growth, led by commercial equipment
financing and private label credit cards. Kidder Peabody, its securities
house, achieved 'sharply improved 1992 results'.
Aerospace had a 'good increase' in operating profit on somewhat higher
revenues, mainly because of sales timing, product mix and productivity
gains.
For the nine months, GE made Dollars 3.38bn, up from Dollars 3.17bn, before
the effects of a one-time accounting change taken in the first quarter.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Hard times and loose banking draw Nigerians to drugs trade:
Plenty of couriers and a free-wheeling financial sector have turned Lagos
into world's leading source of trafficking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO DRUG enforcement officers they are known as 'swallowers' or 'mules' and
in recent years Nigerians, who ingest condoms and balloons filled with
heroin and cocaine, have emerged as the world's leading drug traffickers.
British officials say more Nigerians were arrested in the last three years
trying to smuggle narcotics into the UK than any other nationals. And in the
US customs agents estimate that sophisticated Nigerian drug rings account
for more than 40 per cent of heroin seizures at US ports of entry.
The multi-million dollar illicit trade in drugs is tightly controlled by
Nigerians who use Lagos as a transit station and exploit the country's loose
banking system, porous borders and a police and customs force notorious for
corruption.
Hundreds of kilogrammes of Asian heroin, mostly from India, Thailand and the
Golden triangle, and cocaine from South America pass through Lagos for
storage and repackaging before onward shipment to the US and Europe. Nigeria
has also become the second largest world supplier of cannabis after Ghana,
exporting 5,940lb last year.
Last year US customs agents seized 526lb of white heroin, with a street
value of Dollars 23.9m, from Nigerian controlled smuggling operations. In
the first five months of 1992 seizures had increased to 361lb.
Officials say it is impossible to know what percentage of drugs smuggled
into Europe and the US are seized but estimates vary from 5 to 40 per cent.
For customs officers the difficulty with the Nigerian drug rings stem from
the large quantity of 'swallowers' that are used and the increasing
sophistication of the cartels.
The greatest problem, according to one drug enforcement officer, is that
western prison sentences offer no deterrent to potential smugglers.
'Five years in a western prison with three meals a day, television, the
chance to get an education and earn some pocket money is no deterrent to a
Nigerian making Dollars 30 a month who is suddenly offered Dollars 5,000 to
make a drug run,' the official said.
The 'Nigerian connection' in the international drugs trade first surfaced
around 1984-85 and has grown as the economy of the once rich oil producer
has plummeted. Nigerians have seen one of the fastest declines in living
standards, with gross domestic product per capita falling from Dollars 1,000
in 1980 to Dollars 370 in 1986.
Nigerian drug barons have also flourished in a country where it is easy to
launder drug money through the free-wheeling banking sector and where the
recently established National Drug Law Enforcement Agency is inadequately
funded. Western drug officials also say that widespread corruption in the
police force, customs service and even in the judiciary and the absence of
tough conspiracy laws has protected Nigerians from being arrested and
brought to trial.
Earlier this year Mr Frank Odita, Nigeria's police commissioner, said that
13 judges and a policeman had been implicated in the illegal release of 120
suspects awaiting trial on trafficking charges. Many were freed using forged
bail bonds and release orders.
The NDLEA itself has also faced accusations that some of its agents are
being paid off by the drug rings. Last year the agency's arrest rate fell
sharply and so far it has yet to achieve a big conviction.
Mr Adeogba admits that 'not everybody in the agency is a saint' but says
that the critical problem facing the agency has been insufficient support
for training, funding and sharing of Nigerian controlled drug assets seized
overseas. He says last year 72 per cent of the Dollars 1bn of drug related
assets seized by the US Drug Enforcement Agency were controlled by Nigerians
and that some of these funds should be given to Nigeria to help fight the
drug war.
Western donors, however, say that until the agency cleans up its record and
spends the money it does receive more efficiently, it is difficult to
justify further funding.

A former east German state cellulose factory has been sold to a private
Russian company which wants to pay for urgently needed modernisation by
exporting Russian coal to the west, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin.
Mr Yuri Gekht, chairman of Sokolniki company, signed a contract this week
with the Treuhand privatisation agency to buy the United Cellulose Works in
Pirna which was in liquidation. He paid a symbolic DM1 for the company. Mr
Gekht is a member of the Russian parliament and head of the Producers'
Association.
Sokolniki owns a paper factory in Serpuchov near Moscow and a printing plant
near Tula. It has a licence from the Russian government to produce bonds and
other financial certificates; it needs a steady supply of high-quality
cellulose to assure the quality of its special paper.

Ford of the US appears to be proceeding with plans to build a factory in
Poland to make seat covers for its west European car assembly plants, writes
Christopher Bobinski in Warsaw. The plant would be built at Plonsk, 50km
north of Warsaw; preliminary work has started on a 14.3 hectare site Ford
recently acquired in the town.
The purchase was arranged by Property Services International, a Warsaw-based
real estate company representing Healey and Baker of the UK and Cushman and
Wakefield of the US. The Dollars 50m (Pounds 28m) project could bring 1,000
jobs to Plonsk which has 24,000 inhabitants and a 25 per cent unemployment
rate.
Ford representatives yesterday refused to comment on their plans in Poland,
saying they were still at an 'exploratory' stage and there was 'no sort of
an agreement' in place on the project.

THE US Department of Justice is investigating Mr William Sessions, director
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and his wife for the possible
violation of ethics rules, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The probe of Mr Sessions comes just three days after the Justice Department
called in the FBI to investigate whether Central Intelligence Agency or
Justice officials deliberately concealed intelligence reports relating to
the scandal over Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of illegal loans made to Iraq by
the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL).
The investigation of Mr Sessions and his wife - concerning allegations made
in anonymous letters that they misused government cars and aircraft and that
Mrs Sessions misused her FBI building pass - triggered suggestions by
Democrats that the probe may be a politically inspired attempt to intimidate
the FBI.
Mr Paul McNulty, a Justice Department spokesman, yesterday denied these
suggestions, which came from congressional investigators. 'That is utter
nonsense. There is no tension between us,' he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US Vice-President Dan Quayle and Senator Al Gore engaged in some heated
exchanges last night in the only vice-presidential debate of the election
campaign, which culminates on November 3.
Mr Quayle, in a finger-pointing, aggressive mode, accused Mr Gore of
environmental extremism and a tendency to weakness on national security. But
mostly he was intent to charge that Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic
presidential candidate, was someone who could not tell the truth.
Mr Gore, more even-tempered but unwilling to let Mr Quayle change the
subject, mostly stuck to the Democratic script of emphasising economic
issues. But he also said the Republican campaign had now been taken over by
right-wing extremists out of touch with the interests of real Americans.
Retired Admiral James Stockdale, running mate to Mr Ross Perot, the
independent candidate, often seemed overawed by the occasion and completely
lost the thread of his prepared opening statement. Some of his short
responses verged on inarticulation. On one issue, health care, he confessed
he was 'out of ammunition' and had nothing more to say.
But he managed one telling early intervention, observing after one
particularly sharp verbal volley between Mr Quayle and Mr Gore: 'I think
America is seeing right now why the nation is in gridlock.'
He said at another point: 'I feel like an observer at a ping-pong game'.
To the extent that Mr Stockdale expressed his opinions, his conservative
sympathies were evident, especially on the environment and defence, though
not on abortion. This stands in contrast with Mr Perot, who is usually more
critical of President George Bush than Mr Clinton.
Mr Quayle repeatedly accused Mr Gore of 'pulling a Clinton,' by which he
meant not telling the truth. This, he said, disqualified Mr Clinton from
earning the trust of world leaders. He said that, as vice-president, he had
been tested by fire.
One of Mr Gore's better moments was when he seemed to catch Mr Quayle out on
his knowledge of nuclear disarmament agreements with Russia. He also
probably scored good political points with his arguments that concern for
the environment 'can create jobs' as it was doing in countries such as
Germany and Japan.
Vice-presidential debates are rarely influential in the winning of the White
House and the initial reading of last night's confrontation was that this
would be no exception. Neither Mr Quayle nor Mr Gore landed the telling blow
inflicted on Mr Quayle by Senator Lloyd Bentsen for the Democrats in their
confrontation four years ago.
As the running mate of the front-runner, Mr Gore probably had the most to
lose and the often-derided Mr Quayle the most to gain. Neither disappointed
their supporters.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW between western bankers has blocked finance for desperately needed
equipment to help Russia arrest its rapid decline in oil production.
The European Bank of Reconstruction and Development has a plan to finance
purchases of oil and gas equipment through credits from western commercial
banks and the US Exim bank.
Oil output has plunged from 570m tonnes in 1987 to about 395m this year and
an estimated 340m-350m in 1993.
However, the entire project has been held up by objections from the World
Bank.
The Russians aim to pay back the credits with revenue from the extra
production which the new equipment will bring.
However, under the World Bank's 'negative pledge' rule, it will not permit
other lenders to be treated more favourably than it in the repayment of
credits - and sees a pledge of future oil output to the EBRD, when no such
pledge has been made to it, as more favourable treatment. The World Bank is
providing more than Dollars 1bn of credits for various projects.
Former Soviet president Mikhail Gorbachev was said last night to be planning
a trip to Italy, after the Russian authorities lifted a travel ban to enable
him to go to Germany for the funeral of former West German Chancellor Willy
Brandt.
Russia's constitutional court imposed the ban to try to force Mr Gorbachev
to appear at hearings to decide the fate of the Communist party.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said Mr Gorbachev's passport was only valid for
travel to Germany.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RADICAL right-wing movements will present the most serious threat since 1945
to Germany's political stability, two German specialists warned this week.
A large number of Germans in the east and west already supported militant
right-wing opposition to asylum-seekers entering and living in Germany,
according to Mr Ernst Uhrlau of the Hamburg Agency for the Protection of the
Constitution, which collects and evaluates information about German
extremist movements. They had become disillusioned with the existing main
parties.
Mr Uhrlau said the current wave of violence, mainly against refugees, was an
alarming signal. He feared that extremist parties would come to represent
the 'silent majority' of Germans who were being pushed towards the extreme
right. Right-wing extremists, who numbered at least 60,000, according to Mr
Uhrlau, had provoked 1,400 assaults this year.
Ms Barbara John, head of the Berlin office for foreigners, said she believed
Germany's political system could cope with 'this last flare-up of an old
ideology'. But she added that for the first time in the postwar era
right-wing parties had found a central issue - the growing number of
asylum-seekers entering the country. This is expected to exceed 400,000 this
year.
Mr Uhrlau said he believed grass-roots support for the right was growing,
especially among disaffected young people between the ages of 17 and 21.
Extremists were also profiting from the anger many disadvantaged east
Germans felt towards west Germany. Mr Uhrlau was speaking at a conference in
Germany organised by the Aspen Institute in
Berlin.
Mr Claus Leggewie, professor of political science at the University of
Giessen, said he believed that as much as 20 per cent of the German
electorate had passively supported right-wing extremist views in the past.
He feared such people would actively support parties espousing those views
in the 1994 national elections.
This was the reason the Bonn government was reluctant to crack down
forcefully on the extreme right, he claimed. 'By the time Chancellor Kohl
got around to condemning the violence no one believed him,' Mr Leggewie
added.
In Bonn yesterday, leaders of Germany's governing parties agreed that asylum
seekers from states deemed free of political persecution should be expelled
immediately without a court hearing.
However, the draft plan requires a constitutional amendment which depends on
the backing of the opposition Social Democrats.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR ROBERT HOWES.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, From January 1 1993 a VAT-registered trader who purchases goods from a
company registered for VAT in France or elsewhere in the EC need no longer
pay the value added tax on importation. This tax will now be called
acquisition tax and will be declared on his next VAT return and instantly
cancelled by deducting it as input tax.
However, if he purchases the same goods from a UK company in, say,
Birmingham he will continue to have to pay the input value added tax on his
supplier's invoices and claim it back later, thus suffering a cash-flow
disadvantage.
The prime minister in his speech to the party conference expressed
determination to hack through the jungle of red tape. Might I suggest that
he commences by levelling the commercial playing field with the rest of
Europe and allow VAT-registered traders to zero-rate supplies to other
VAT-registered traders in the UK.

In the UK anyone admitting to 'going to work on an egg' is subject to
instant derision, comparable to admitting to being a smoker. But in the US
the Centers for Disease Control have discovered that cholesterol-awareness
levels vary widely across the country. In the maple-syrup stronghold of
Vermont, for instance, an average 31 per cent of people know their
cholesterol level. Hard on its heels are Maine, Massachusetts, North Dakota
and Wisconsin, each with an average 30 per cent.
Bottom of the league table, with just 15 per cent awareness, comes
Washington DC. But given the amount of stress generated in that fraught
city, perhaps people have more pressing things to worry about.

How times change. Only a few months ago Walt Disney chairman Michael Eisner
was being accused by the French intelligentsia of foisting a 'cultural
Chernobyl' on France in the form of his Euro Disneyland theme park. Yet this
week he found himself in the Matignon Palace in Paris, receiving the
honorary title of Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur from Pierre Beregovoy,
the French prime minister.
If it seems a little strange that the Disney chairman should have received
the French government's blessing so soon after the 'Chernobyl' eruption, it
should be remembered that the French government is not exactly stingy when
it comes to dishing out honours, especially when there are jobs on the line.
Who knows one day Eisner may follow in the footsteps of the great Walt
Disney himself and be promoted into the officier class?

Not all the scriptwriters at Russia's Foreign Ministry have been changed

Norway's expulsion of a Russian diplomat.
Following a week's silence on the hurried return home of Viktor Fediuk, a
third secretary said to be in the employ of Russian military intelligence,
come indications that the cold winds sweeping the Moscow streets have now
penetrated one of the most liberal ministries of the post-Gorbachev era. The
foreign affairs functionaries yesterday lashed out at the Norwegian media
for conducting a 'campaign  .. to revive distrust and suspiciousness which
had become a thing of the past .. The stirring of passions and far-fetched
statements is aimed at damaging the prestige of Russia.'
A Norwegian correspondent in Moscow saw it differently. 'A spy scandal in a
small country like Norway with a big neighbour like Russia is great stuff
for our newspapers'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If former Labour party leader Neil Kinnock had been given the job of editing
the Sunday Telegraph, Prime Minister Major could not have had a more hostile
critic than its new editor, 35-year-old Charles Moore.
This opinion of one seasoned political observer may be over the top but the
editorship of a traditionally Conservative paper has been handed to a young
man who is not a great admirer of Britain's embattled prime minister. Old
hands at reading the political tea leaves will be making their own judgments
of what it means.
The appointment certainly has the hallmarks of Conrad Black, a proprietor
keen to hedge his bets, more than Max Hastings, the editor-in-chief who has
overall responsibility for the content of the daily and Sunday newspapers.
Perhaps Moore will be more supportive of the PM now he has been made an
editor. But many think not judging by his column in last week's Spectator.
'Mr Major may come from Brixton, but he is treating his own people as if he
were a Bourbon' opined Moore.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN JENKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I agreed with your editorial 'Filling in the policy gaps' (October 9).
You rightly criticised the chancellor's speech at the Conservative party
conference for being economically thin.
But I must accuse you of the same fault in one vital respect. You said and I
paraphrase slightly in the interest of brevity - 'the competitive gains for
devaluation will only be maintained if pay settlements average no more than
2 per cent'. I agree completely. You go on to say that, if they do, the
authorities may need to tighten policy. But how, how, how do we do this
effectively? As you say, after two years of recession and tight monetary
policy, average earnings are still rising at 6 per cent per annum.
This tight policy may well have terminally and disastrously ruined Britain's
productive capability and yet still wages go on rising. And I bet that if
prosperity by some miracle returned tomorrow, vastly inflationary wage
claims would leap into place the day after.
Please, therefore, tell me what we should do to fulfil your admirable first
criterion without entailing the ruination of British productive capacity.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Letter: Short sighted to halve the size of UK coal industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From MR JAMES MCFARLANE.
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Whatever the bullying tactics of mineworkers in the past, it can't make
sense to more than halve what remains of the industry. In an island as
crowded and as short of natural resources as ours, it is perverse to neglect
what we have.
Political pundits, electricity generators, shirt-sleeved traders and teenage
scribblers justify the prospect by telling us what any fool knows, namely
that you can buy fuel cheaply from offshore sources at present. I hope that
somebody is considering whether this is still likely to be true in one, five
and 20 years' time.
Closing mines is not an easily reversible process and I hope we know where
our energy will come from if South African coal mines fall into chaos or
something blows our oil and gas rigs out of the sea.
Quite apart from such strategic risks, there is the mundane consideration
that further devaluations of the pound can soon change today's bargain into
tomorrow's extortionate price. Such weakening of the currency will be
accelerated if we damage the balance of payments by importing yet more of
our raw materials.
It might be wrong to think that the electricity generators have all this at
the front of their minds in deciding what amount of coal to buy in the UK
and hence what proportion of the mines will be closed. They have more
immediate concerns than this and they know that, in the ultimate, no
conceivable UK government can allow electricity generators to founder
completely. That is why it was a mistake to privatise them. If one of them
takes a short cut to a cost saving, the other will have to do likewise.
We can all see short cuts but who can save us from short sight?

Council members do not practise what they preach about arms sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Gloom in Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. Jubilation, presumably, in Lima,
Ohio. General Dy-namics has won the contract to supply 236 tanks to Kuwait,
and Vickers has lost it.
Kuwait is spending about Pounds 1bn on this contract. Its only consideration
 -one that has been almost lost from sight in the discussion about jobs and
votes in the UK and US - should be whether, protected by those tanks, its
citizens can sleep safer in their beds.
Had the tanks been there on August 2 1990, would Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein have been less likely to send his army across the border? Almost
certainly it would have made no difference. Iraq would still have had
overwhelming superiority, and Kuwait's willingness to spend money on weapons
would not have altered Mr Saddam's low opinion of its fighting spirit.
The weakness of the Gulf emirates and sheikhdoms is structural, not
technical. They have a lot of money and very few people. Their neighbours,
Iraq and Iran, are always going to be stronger, and Arab Gulf states, faced
with renewed aggression from either of them, are always likely to need help
from abroad.
You would hardly think it needed saying again, but arms sales are not the
route to a safer or more stable Middle East.
Last December the UN General Assembly, responding to an initiative from the
British government, established an Arms Transfer Register. It listed seven
categories of weapons as potentially destabilising, because of their value
in offensive operations. Main battle tanks come top of the list.
The register is an important first step towards transparency of arms
supplies, which in turn is a crucial confidence-building measure. Arms
races, while fuelled partly by greed, can be publicly justified only by
fear, and can sometimes be checked by shame. If the facts about your
potential adversary's acquisitions are in the public domain, at least you do
not have to base your own procurement programme on wild supposition; and in
some cases purchases may be inhibited by the knowledge of the governments
concerned that that they will be placed on public record.
But a list of transfers by itself is not enough. To make it meaningful, the
register should include existing national holdings and production. Also, at
present transfers have to be registered only when they have physically taken
place. Yet orders are often placed years in advance, and governments remain
highly secretive about arms deals in the pipeline. When planning your own
defences, it is what your adversary may have in the future that is relevant,
at least as much as what he has now. In any case, transparency is only one
prerequisite for a solution. Unless arms sales are effectively curtailed,
the fact of their being public could even act as a stimulant. Suppliers and
purchasers could use the register to show that they are only doing the same
as their competitors or adversaries.
The five permanent members of the UN Security Council ('the P5'), which
happen also to be the largest arms suppliers, took the lead in proclaiming
the need for greater restraint in the wake of the Gulf war. On a French
suggestion, they have held regular meetings on the subject. But they hardly
seem to be practising what they preach.
According to the Saferworld Foundation, a research and lobbying charity, the
US received arms orders worth about Dollars 28.5bn from the Middle East in
the two years following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. The principal client was
Saudi Arabia, with orders of more than Dollars 17bn - and that was before US
President George Bush approved the sale of 72 F-15 fighter jets last month.
The administration predicts total US arms sales for 1992 worth Dollars 35bn,
the majority going to the Middle East.
Russia is still the second biggest arms supplier, although it is not so
generous with precise figures. In 1991 it received orders worth Dollars 2bn
from Syria alone, for weapons including T-72 main battle tanks, fighter
aircraft and missiles. While Syria claims it needs these weapons to offset
Israel's overwhelming superiority, Israel uses them as an argument to
extract yet more sophisticated weapons from the US. It seems unlikely that
the Middle East peace process, of which both the US and Russia are sponsors,
is thereby facilitated.
Even more destabilising, in both western and Arab eyes, are Russian arms
supplies to Iran. The value of these is unknown, but in 1991 they reportedly
included 25 Su-24 bombers, 50 MiG-29 fighters, an unknown number of MiG31
and Su-27 aircraft, and 200 T-72 main battle tanks. A Russian foreign
ministry spokesman, Mr Sergei Yastrzhembsky, recently confirmed that Russia
would go ahead with a contract to sell three Kilo-class diesel-powered
submarines to Iran, reportedly worth Dollars 750m, even though the US Senate
has banned any US aid to Russia until arms sales to Iran are halted.
Annual hard-currency revenue from such sales would be three to four times
greater than the credit blocked by the Senate, explained a senior official
at the Russian ministry of foreign economic relations last week - which
suggests reports that Iran is interested in purchasing a further 1,000-1,500
tanks and a variety of other equipment may be true.
Mr Yastrzhembsky claimed: 'We take care to see that the regional balance is
not upset.' But that notion of a regional balance is at the root of the arms
race, since each state tends to measure itself against the combined strength
of several different potential adversaries, and a state like Iran, placed at
the intersection of the Middle East with central and south Asia, may even
argue that it has to cope with threats from more than one region.
The UK's Middle East order book of Dollars 4bn in 1990-92 looks meagre by
comparison, but not for want of trying. Touting British equipment in the
Gulf is still one of the main responsibilities of British defence ministers,
and Vickers has been careful not to bite the hand that feeds it by blaming
the government for its failure to win the Kuwait contract.
France is in there too, with sales to Abu Dhabi, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Turkey
and, of course, Saudi Arabia. And Chinese sales (including 72 F-7 aircraft
to Iran in 1991) are supposed to be of particular concern to the US. Yet
this did not stop Mr Bush authorising the sale of 150 F-16 fighter jets to
Taiwan last month, prompting China to withdraw from the P5 talks on arms
control in the Middle East.
One glimmer of hope: the European Parliament, prompted by Saferworld, has
called for an EC code of conduct on arms exports. It is true that under
Article 223 of the Treaty of Rome the EC cannot prevent any member state
from taking 'such measures as it considers necessary for the protection of
the essential interests of its security which are connected with the
production of or trade in arms'. But at least member states could be asked
why they think arms sales to the Middle East are necessary, whereas arms
sales to Bosnia (which is actually engaged in a struggle for survival,
against aggression and 'ethnic cleansing') are still banned.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: UK bonds rally as rate cut hopes are
rekindled
</HEADLINE>

LONG-dated UK government bonds rose sharply yesterday as investors moved
from shorter-dated paper, reversing some of the recent steepening of the
sterling yield curve.
A general feeling that gains in short-dated gilts had been overdone, and
that fears of a resurgence of inflation had been overstated, helped to
encourage the move, observers said. The market was also buoyed by growing
confidence in an interest rate cut, probably of half a percentage point, in
the near future, and the stability of sterling. The currency ended above
DM2.52, up from around DM2.51 the day before.
Figures released yesterday showed producer price inflation unchanged in
September, at an annual rate of 3.2 per cent. With further evidence of the
weakness of the UK economy expected in the next two days, and an unexpected
move by Abbey National yesterday to cut its mortgage rate again, the belief
gained ground that a base rate cut was imminent.
Index-linked gilts did not participate in the best of yesterday's gains,
despite a general perception that the rally in inflation-linked instruments
still has some way to run.
These bonds should perform well if interest rates fall or if inflation fears
resurface, said Mr Nigel Richardson, sterling bond economist at S G Warburg.
Yesterday, with longer-dated gilts gaining more than a point, index-linked
paper rose by only around a quarter of a point. Long gilt futures on Liffe
also jumped a point, ending the day at 97 1/4 , compared with Monday's close
of 96 9/32 .
OTHER European markets generally strengthened yesterday on the back of a
half point rise in the German market. Demand for D-Mark paper - as evidenced
by the flood of new issues in the Eurobond market - continues to be strong,
while the market was also said to have been led higher by a sharp technical
rise in bund futures.
The French market moved up in line with Germany in late trading, with OATs
showing a rise of a third of a point.
US Treasury prices were mixed to slightly lower late yesterday despite early
gains on renewed, if still faint, hopes of another interest rate cut by the
Federal Reserve.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year bond was down  3/16 at 96 19/32,
yielding 7.532 per cent. The two-year note was unchanged at 100 1/32, to
yield 3.966 per cent.
After the market reopened following Monday's holiday prices got off to a
firm start, a delayed reaction to comments from Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed
chairman, on Sunday which suggested that the monetary authorities may not,
after all, have ruled out another rate cut before election day on November
3.
Although most of the market still doubts there will be another policy ease,
there was enough short covering to boost prices across the board in early
trading. By the afternoon, however, a rise in the weekly Johnson Redbook
report on store sales sparked retail selling and pushed long-dated prices
into negative territory.
JAPANESE government bonds rose yesterday, breaking out of their recent
narrow trading range as traders sensed the possibility of easing of monetary
policy by the Bank of Japan. In Tokyo, overnight rates fell below 4 per cent
at one stage, dipping out of their current range, and although nothing on
the Bank of Japan's part encouraged the fall, the dip in market rates
encouraged hopes of a cut.
This was enough to lift the JGB futures contract, which rose from 106.20 to
106.42 before falling back to 106.33.
Japan's banking industry is studying a new method to promote the sales of
corporate loan holdings in a bid to meet international capital adequacy
standards, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Mr Tsuneo Wakai, chairman of the Federation of Bankers Associations of
Japan, said: 'We are studying various measures, and the measure (which will
make use of commercial paper) is one of them.'
Under the plan, a bank will set up a paper company in a tax-haven country
and also establish a Tokyo branch. The Tokyo branch will buy corporate loans
from the bank and the company in the tax-haven country will then issue CP
overseas, backed by the corporate loans as collateral.

FT  14 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Repurchase facility set up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LEHMAN Brothers International and Euroclear, the Brussels-based clearing
house, have set up a tri-party repurchase facility aimed at encouraging
banks and fund managers to enter the growing European repo market, writes
Tracy Corrigan.
Last month, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),
Swiss Bank Corporation and Cedel announced the first tri-party repurchase
agreement (repo) programme to be launched in Europe.
The repo market allows institutions to boost returns by lending out
securities on a short term basis. Tri-party programmes reduce the risk of
failed trades and lower costs for counterparties deterred by complex
processing involved in repurchase agreements.

FT  14 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Strong Far East demand for World Bank
yen issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE World Bank's second global yen bond offering, launched yesterday, met
strong demand from Far Eastern investors, but the reception from European
institutions was less enthusiastic.
The Y225bn offering of five-year global bonds is due to be priced early
today at a yield spread of 24-26 basis points above the No 105 five-year
Japanese government bond.
Dealers reported unusually strong interest from US investors, as well as
aggressive buying by Japanese and South East Asian accounts.
'This issue shows the worth of the global bond concept,' said one
underwriter. 'A deal of this size could not have been smoothly executed in
the Eurobond market.'
The deal, arranged by Daiwa, Nomura and Goldman Sachs International, could
be set at the low end of the indicated range as a result of the strong Far
Eastern demand. But further supply in the Euroyen sector is not likely to
follow, unless European interest picks up.
The recent widening of yield spreads in the Euroyen sector has eradicated
the trading differential between Euroyen bonds and domestic bonds launched
in the Japanese market. As a result, the spread on the World Bank offering
appeared more attractive to domestic investors than for the last global
offering. The previous global deal, a 10-year offering launched in March, is
now trading at a spread of 37 basis points over the 10-year benchmark (which
is trading very tightly compared with other JGBs.)
Yield spreads in the Euroyen sector have widened by about 10 basis points in
the last month, and by 20-30 basis points since the start of the summer.
World Bank Eurobonds received a blow last month, when the Italian government
repealed a withholding tax exemption for Italian investors. However, few yen
bonds were held by Italian investors, and the impact was concentrated on the
World Bank's dollar and D-Mark deals.
Meanwhile, the flow of issues in the D-Mark sector continued yesterday, with
deals for Toyota Electric Power Company and the European Coal and Steel
Community.
In addition, Sweden's large DM2bn issue, launched on Monday was increased to
DM2.5bn due to strong demand for the paper. Despite being priced at the low
end of the indicated spread range - at 45 basis points above the curve - the
paper sold out rapidly, with strong demand from international and domestic
institutional investors boosted by a rising bund market.
The 8 per cent bonds, initially priced at 100.28, traded strongly to close
at 100.43 bid.
Other issues, such as Tepco's DM1bn 10-year deal priced to yield 27 basis
points over the 10-year bund yield, fared less well, and will take rather
longer to place, dealers said.
Also in the D-Mark sector, the European Coal &amp; Steel Community launched a
DM105m five-year offering via Bayerische Vereinsbank. In the dollar sector,
Toyota Motor Finance launched a Dollars 250m three-year deal, under its
medium-term note programme, via Lehman Brothers. The deal was considered
fairly priced at 55 basis points over the curve, and is not expected to add
to congestion in the dollar sector.

FT  14 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Property price bubble blamed
on bank technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SPECULATIVE bubble in property prices, which today is at the heart of
many countries' economic problems and has led to big losses for hundreds of
banks, was to a large extent caused by advances in banking technology.
That is the view of Mr Gerald Corrigan, who is one of the most influential
spokesmen on banking regulation as chairman of the Basle-based committee on
bank supervision and president of the New York Federal Reserve.
In an agenda-setting speech, Mr Corrigan said that technological change was
the 'missing link in terms of efforts to explain why credit-induced asset
price bubbles have been able to move with such relative ease from one spot
on the globe to another'.
He said that common economic influences, such as inflationary expectations,
did not provide a sufficient explanation of why developers and others in so
many countries borrowed vast sums to invest in property in the last decade.
The effect of this borrowing in the US, the UK, Japan, France, Spain,
Scandinavia and other regions was to push up property prices very sharply,
until a slowdown in economic growth led to a collapse in prices.
Mr Corrigan said that advances in the technology of processing information
and executing transactions have 'made it easier and 'cheaper' for borrowers
and lenders to tap fresh sources of capital and finance'.
This new technology can, as one example, reduce the risk for a bank of
operating in a foreign country, thereby increasing the capital available to
borrowers in that country.
Mr Corrigan also said that the ability of a financial institution to collate
and process vast amounts of financial data rapidly using computers has
allowed the institution to 'arbitrage' - or shift funds to take advantage of
price disparities - in property markets as well as in foreign exchange and
securities.
Financial innovation, especially the creation of derivative products, also
facilitated these cross-border flows of capital. Institutions could, for
example, use derivative products to reduce the exchange and interest rate
risks of investing in the UK compared with Japan.
However, the Basle committee has no simple remedy to reduce the risk of the
new technology. He urged banks to 'tame' the technology by developing 'risk
management and management information systems that will provide the top
management of financial institutions with the tools and the information to
ensure that applied technology is being used in a safe, sound and prudent
manner'.
Mr Corrigan was speaking last week at the international conference of
banking supervisors in Cannes and has been delivering this message in a
series of private meetings over the past month with senior bankers and
regulators.

FT  14 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Good quarterlies help extend
rally in Dow
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
A SERIES of unexpectedly good third quarter earnings reports, and computer
program buying lifted US stock markets to solid gains yesterday writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 27.01 at 3,201.42,
about ten points below its highs for the day. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended firmer, up 1.84 at 409.28, while the Amex
composite put on 0.85 at 366.83 and the Nasdaq composite added 2.60 at
576.44. Turnover on the NYSE was 185m shares, with rises outpacing declines
by 1014 to 706.
After Monday's gains, which had more to do with the thinness of trading
during the Columbus Day unofficial holiday than with any shift in investor
sentiment, yesterday's advances were achieved following a genuine
improvement in market fundamentals.
Investors had approached the third quarter corporate reporting season
gingerly, fearing that because of the weaker- than-expected economic growth
during the summer, company profits would also come in below forecasts. The
first batch of figures, however, have proved as good, and in some cases
better, than anticipated.
Prices were also aided by program trading, and the continued belief among
some investors that the market may have been slightly oversold during last
week's substantial correction.
Among individual stocks, securities houses were in strong demand following
quarterly reports which defied the conventional wisdom that the summer
slowdown in investor activity would crimp brokers' profits. Merrill Lynch
rose Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 51 1/2 on a 44 per cent jump in net income to
Dollars 230.1m, and PaineWebber climbed Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 18 1/2 on a
35 per cent improvement in profits to Dollars 51.7m.
Other brokerage stocks firmed in expectation of similar reports, with Morgan
Stanley rising Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 47 3/8 , Bear Stearns climbing
Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 15 1/8 , Salomon adding Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 37
5/8 , Charles Schwab rising Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 18 and JP Morgan edging
Dollars  1/4 higher to Dollars 61 1/4 .
Pepsico rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 38 5/8 in heavy trading after the
soft-drinks and food group unveiled a 22 per cent increase in third quarter
earnings to Dollars 425.7m. Coca-Cola rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 in
sympathy.
Caterpillar gained Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 51 as analysts suggested that
the heavy equipment manufacturer would gain considerably from a Democratic
victory in the November presidential elections because of the party's plans
to boost spending on the infrastructure if elected.
On the Nasdaq market, First Financial rose Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 17 1/2
on third quarter profits of 65 cents a share, up from 43 cents a share a
year earlier. Caere, up Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 32 3/4 , was also buoyed by
better-than-expected earnings, as was Lattice Semi, up Dollars  3/8 at
Dollars 21 1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks strayed little from Friday's levels, despite a run-up in US
share prices.
The TSE 300 index was off 3.64 points, or 0.11 per cent, from Friday's close
to 3,214.85, as declining issues outpaced advances 281 to 240. Volume was
24.5m shares worth CDollars 183.6m as against 24.5m shares worth CDollars
285.9m on Friday. The market was closed Monday for a holiday.
Tuesday's mixed finish came despite two days of gains for US stocks, which
usually influence the Canadian market. Mining shares were down slightly,
while energy, industrial products, consumer products and financial services
were up moderately.

FT  14 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Athens sinks in spite of government
reassurance - Kerin Hope discusses the slide in Greek equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREEK investors feel that they have more to worry about than mere turbulence
on international currency markets.
Continuing fears of war in the neighbouring, former Yugoslavian republic of
Kosovo, combined with a rise in interest rates and the prospect of a harsh
1993 budget, have sent prices on the Athens Stock Exchange plunging.
After an attempt at recovery earlier this month, the market resumed its
downtrend nine days ago, hitting new 30-month lows in consecutive sessions
since the middle of last week. The Athens stock exchange index closed
yesterday at 636.43.
The early October recovery followed an initiative by the economy ministry,
which took the unusual step of reassuring investors publicly that its
two-year old economic adjustment programme is still on track. It pledged
that measures to curb inflation would yield results in the near future,
bringing a steady decline in interest rates. This brought about a three-day
rally, culminating with the index at 675.49, in steady daily volume of some
Dr1.2bn (Dollars 6.3m), on October 2. But the prevailing mood of gloom has
not really lightened.
'There's not much expectation of good news,' says Mr Spyros Kriticopoulos,
chief of research at M. Kyranis Securities. 'The budget is going to be
strict to stop the deficit from expanding. It's hard to feel confident that
interest rates will come down quickly.'
Even before the turmoil erupted on the currency markets, Greek interest
rates had started to rise. A Dr580bn revenue-raising package launched in
August, which included increases in petrol tax and VAT on raw materials,
added almost two percentage points to the inflation rate.
With inflation running at some 15 per cent, the government raised interest
rates on 12 month Treasury bills, the main vehicle for financing the public
sector deficit, to 21.5 per cent. As borrowing rates moved close to 30 per
cent for working capital, companies started to postpone plans for
investment.
The drachma, which is not a member of the exchange rate mechanism, was
partly cushioned from speculative assaults last month by tight exchange
controls.
Anticipation that the drachma would be devalued gave the bourse a
short-lived boost. Shares in leading exporting companies, producers of
cement, plastics and textiles, were snapped up.
The government, however, has remained opposed to devaluation and the central
bank has reaffirmed its policy of pegging the drachma to the D-mark, in
spite of a heavy drain on foreign exchange reserves in the past three weeks.
Against the dollar, most of the drachma's decline last month of just over 4
per cent, has now been made up.
Nevertheless, the government's strong drachma policy is under constant
attack from Greek exporters who claim that the currency is now overvalued by
around 10 per cent. They argue that following the recent devaluations of the
lira and the peseta, Greek products are becoming increasingly uncompetitive.
Mr Jacovos Babalitis, an analyst with Northern Greek Securities, says: 'The
drachma's strength is another factor depressing the market. Investors are
generally hesitant because of doubts about future government policy and
events outside Greece.'
Amid this anxiety, some encouraging first-half results from construction and
food processing companies have been disregarded. More attention was paid to
a weak first-half performance in the banking sector, which accounts for over
40 per cent of the market's total equity capitalisation. After several years
of strong profit growth, rising operating costs and reduced spreads on
lending in a more competitive environment are affecting their earnings.
Underlying political uncertainty is being reinforced by the government's
repeated warnings that conflict is imminent in the Albanian populated
province of Kosovo, ruled by Serbia.
'The possibility that war may spread close to Greece's northern border is at
the back of every investors mind,' says Mr Babalitis.

A FIRM start on Wall Street propelled bourses higher for the second day but
trading remained thin as investors stuck to the sidelines, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT registered its biggest one-day gain in a month, the DAX index
closing 32.96 or 2.3 per cent higher at 1,465.50. But turnover rose only
slightly to DM3.8bn from DM3.3bn and trading logistics, rather than an
improvement in sentiment, were given credit for the rise.
The tendency to move upwards, prompted traders to cover short positions and
this had an exaggerated effect in an illiquid market.
Major moves among international blue chips, Volkswagen rising DM13.20 to
DM270.70 and Bayer by DM7.50 to DM249.70, were a clawback from VW's
underperformance in the third quarter and the chemical industry favourite's
exaggerated response to a hazardous materials scare on Monday.
Thyssen put on DM11.90 to DM169.50, also after a poor third quarter.
Deutsche Babcock rose DM9.10 to DM137.80 for a two-day gain of 10 per cent,
after a newspaper interview on Monday in which Babcock's chairman said the
company's performance in the year to September 30 had beaten expectations .
AMSTERDAM featured KNP which fell sharply following its announcement after
Monday's close that it expected net profit to fall to Fl 100m from Fl 294.7m
in 1991, because of a disappointing third quarter and unfavourable prospects
for the fourth quarter. The CBS Tendency index finished 0.4 lower at 107.1.
KNP initially tumbled 20 per cent to an intraday low of Fl 31.60 but
recovered slightly in the afternoon to close down Fl 6.50 at Fl 33.00.
Other paper stocks weakened on the KNP news, with Buhrmann-Tetterode
shedding Fl 3.10 to Fl 30.80.
Fokker also attracted sellers following another unconfirmed report that Dasa
might withdraw from its proposed takeover. The shares fell to a day's low of
Fl 15.60 before recovering to close up 50 cents at Fl 17.00.
PARIS rose steadily during the day and closed at the day's high but trading
remained thin. The market was lifted by bargain-hunting in blue-chips and by
the firmer start on Wall Street. The CAC-40 index closed up 30.04 or 1.8 per
cent at 1,685.09 in modest turnover of FFr1.3bn.
Euro Disney was one of the day's most prominent risers, adding FFr4.80 or
6.9 per cent to FFr74.70 on news of better-than-expected attendance figures
for September.
Among second-line stocks, Valeo was in demand, rising FFr29 to FFr630. The
company held a meeting with analysts yesterday.
ZURICH saw its big price changes in second line stocks as the SMI index rose
12.1 to 1,893.6. In the forefront was a SFr35 rise to SFr805 in Swiss
Volksbank, up SFr145, or 22 per cent over the past five trading days.
Mr Jeremy Silewicz at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said that Volksbank had
underperformed this year and that rumours of a takeover bid had had an
accordingly electric effect on the share price. Otherwise, after a strong
market performance this year, investors were looking beyond the obvious blue
chips to extend their Swiss portfolios.
MILAN came off early lows as share prices staged a late recovery. Trading
was technical ahead of the close of the account today. The Comit index ended
2.57 lower at 394.28 in turnover estimated at between L150-200bn.
Fiat settled down L81 at L4,100 but rose in after-hours trading to L4,400
and Generali, fixed L520 lower at L27,610, picked up later to L28,400.
There was still some downward pressure on Ras ahead of its rights issue,
which starts tomorrow, the first day of the new account. The shares lost L10
to L14,890.
Avir, which was suspended limit-down on Monday, remained suspended yesterday
pending an announcement from the company.
MADRID paid little attention to the better-than-expected CPI data which
showed an increase of 0.9 per cent in September and the general index lost
1.28 to 192.68 in low volume.
STOCKHOLM was lifted by firm foreign bourses. The Affarsvarlden General
index rose 10.5 to 675.8 in turnover of SKr264m after SKr213m.
Astra was the session's most active issue with combined turnover of about
SKr47m for both classes of shares. The A shares rose SKr12 to SKr517 while
the B shares rose SKr9 to SKr506.
BRUSSELS was led higher by insurance shares which rose in response to last
week's cut in domestic interest rates. The Bel-20 index closed 7.3 higher at
1,099.84 in turnover of BFr648m. Leading insurer AG closed BFr25 or 1.3 per
cent higher at BFr1,970.
VIENNA was encouraged by OMV's forecasts of good profit growth this year and
its announcement of a new North Sea oil find. The ATX index rose 8.15 to
778.67 while OMV improved Sch11 to Sch680.

FT  14 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Strong futures lift
Nikkei in technical trade
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG futures market lifted share prices, and the Nikkei average rose on
arbitrage buying and index-linked purchases by investment trust funds,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 188.66 to 17,490.67. The index opened at the
day's low of 17,341.32 and rose to the day's high of 17,577.63 in the
afternoon. Towards the close, position adjustments by dealers cut some of
the gains.
Volume rose to 210m shares from 163m. Advances led declines by 672 to 233
with 171 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks gained 10.91 to 1,320.24 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose
1.65 to 1060.11.
Analysts said that while share prices seemed to be on a slow upturn,
institutional investors were not hurrying to participate. Ms Kathy Matsui,
strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said an expected decline of the yen
against the dollar would help high-technology issues. 'The current low
prices are simply not justified,' she added. Some analysts are now looking
for the yen to fall against the dollar, possibly to the Y130 level.
High-technology blue chips rose on buying by dealers and foreign investors.
Toshiba gained Y5 to Y584 and Sony rose Y10 to Y4,040. NEC, however, fell Y8
to Y707 on small-lot selling. There have been concerns about the company's
earnings due to sales of cheaper personal computers by a US computer
company.
Environmental-theme stocks gained on buying by speculators. Shinagawa Fuel,
a fuel dealer which is conducting research into plastic waste recycling, was
the most active issue of the day, rising Y43 to Y998. Kubota, a farming
equipment and duct pipe maker, also advanced Y13 to Y595.
Aids-related issues were firm with Green Cross, the pharmaceutical maker,
gaining Y50 to Y1,620 and Sumitomo Chemical Y7 to Y473. Nikken Chemicals, in
demand because of its research into a drug to treat Alzheimer's disease,
advanced Y10 to Y1,080, a high for the year.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 220.24 to 19,173.38, rising above the 19,000
level for the first time since September 30. Volume however, remained
subdued at 7.8m shares against Monday's 6m.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mixed yesterday.
HONG KONG closed firmer on follow-through buying from Monday's rise, but
brokers said investors were nervous ahead of tomorrow's airport talks. The
Hang Seng index touched 5,770 twice before closing 30.53 higher at 5,756.10,
in turnover of HKDollars 2.44bn.
Property stocks again led the active list, with Sun Hung Kai falling 25
cents to HKDollars 33.25 and Cheung Kong shedding 10 cents to Dollars 21.10.
AUSTRALIA was dragged lower by depressed metal prices and BHP's weakness,
closing at an 18-month low. The All Ordinaries index lost 6.1 to 1,456.9 in
turnover of ADollars 203.95m.
BHP shed 14 cents to ADollars 11.42 while Western Mining slipped 15 cents to
ADollars 4.15 after warning of flat minerals demand this year. CRA lost 20
cents to ADollars 11.76 on reports that the Papua New Guinea government
might renegotiate mining contracts.
NEW ZEALAND broke six consecutive days of declines with a 15.61-point rise
in the NZSE-40 index to 1,361.17. Turnover was NZDollars 27m.
Rises in Telecom and Carter Holt Harvey contributed to the market's
recovery, with gains of 4 cents and 7 cents to NZDollars 2.24 and NZDollars
2.37 respectively.
MANILA advanced steadily, as rumours that First Philippine Holdings may lift
its dividend encouraged sentiment. The composite index rose 6.68 to 1,398.56
in combined turnover of 331m pesos.
First Philippine Holdings gained 2.50 pesos to 49.00.
SINGAPORE's Straits Times Industrial Index rose 6.28 to 1,332.88 in volume
of 41.5m shares, while KUALA LUMPUR's composite index also firmed in quiet
trading, up 2.53 at 605.13.
BANGKOK finished mixed as the SET index lost 3.03 to 868.68 in turnover of
Bt8.50bn, the lowest daily level in a month. Bangkok Land was the most
active stock, ending unchanged at Bt132 in turnover of Bt501.4m.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (3): Some confusion in the air - Road and
rail services steadily improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVON has suffered in the past from a perception that it is relatively
isolated within the UK transport network; too inaccessible from London, the
south east and the midlands.
This certainly used to be true, but the county's successful start in
diversifying its economy has been largely because of great improvement in
its links with other parts of the UK and the rest of Europe. Many more need
to be forged, but the main task now is to get this message across.
In general, the principal centres are within two to four hours drive, via
the M5 and the motorway network, of nearly all the larger cities of England
and Wales.
'Communications have often been a handicap in the past, but they have been
greatly improved . . .we must carry on pushing for the remaining handicaps
to be resolved,' says Mr Eric Dancer, chairman of the Devon and Cornwall
Training and Enterprise Council.
Drawbacks to road communications that clearly remain are the lack of a
motorway across the county into Cornwall, and the poor links from north to
south. Two specific improvements most sorely needed are the Barnstaple
downstream bridge to relieve traffic congestion and improve north-south
access, and the Kingskerswell bypass to relieve congestion in and around
Torbay.
Exeter, the county capital and a growing financial services centre, is well
positioned at the end of the M5, with journey times of just over an hour to
Bristol, three hours to Birmingham and three hours to London. But
termination of the motorway at Exeter means that while the east of the
county is well served, other areas still await improvements. The A38, which
continues as a dual or triple carriageway from Exeter to Plymouth, is a high
quality trunk route, but there are increasing demands for it to be upgraded
to full motorway status.
Again, it is a matter of perception. 'The blue line on the map stops at
Exeter and this looks bad to overseas companies considering investing in the
south of the county,' says Mr Ken Martin, chief executive of the Devon and
Cornwall Investment Bureau, which is responsible for attracting overseas
companies to the county.
Within Devon, recent completion of the north Devon link road has greatly
improved internal communications, linking the northern centres of Barnstaple
and Bideford with Exeter and the motorway network.
The main road project still under way is upgrading the A30 trunk road as the
principal access route from southern England. When completed, in 1994-95, it
will be an alternative to the M5/M4 route to London, the M25 and the channel
tunnel and ports, and it will give better access to and from Cornwall in the
west.
Improvements in British Rail's InterCity services have brought Exeter within
two hours of London's Paddington station, and there are frequent trains
throughout the day, including early morning business expresses.
Here again, Plymouth, the county's big industrial and commercial centre,
gets a poorer deal. The city has a disproportionately longer rail journey
time of over three hours, and there is no train arrival from London before
mid-morning. Plymouth would benefit from a more limited stopping service, to
give faster access to Paddington.
Exeter has another rail link to London through east Devon, Dorset and
Salisbury to Waterloo. This line will never rival the Paddington service,
however, as the journey takes almost twice as long.
The big increase in traffic on the line could lead to improvements, but at
present it is seen mostly as a local community service between Exeter and
Salisbury, and as a commuting service from southern Hampshire into London.
It could increase in importance when the Channel tunnel rail terminal opens
at Waterloo.
There are two airports operating in the county, at Exeter and Plymouth. Each
has sought to become the region's premier airport, and a cohesive approach
to the needs of air passengers has suffered from the rivalry between them.
Exeter, owned by the county council, has a turnover of over Pounds 1m; it
runs scheduled services to London's City airport, Belfast, the Channel
Islands, Paris, Dinard and Toronto. Among its big advantages are an
excellent weather record and a long runway which can take the biggest
aircraft.
However, most of its recent growth has been in holiday charter flights. The
three biggest tour operators, Thomson, Airtours and Owners Abroad all use
the airport and, in addition to Spain, Portugal and the Balearics, new
destinations planned for next year include Cyprus and Crete.
Plymouth, Brymon Airways' base, concentrates more on scheduled services to
London Heathrow, Dublin, the Channel Islands and Paris. (Bristol airport is
used as a hub for other on-going flights to the continent and the rest of
the UK.) Its big drawback is that it has a short runway and can only operate
with short take-off aircraft. There is much talk of upgrading Plymouth so
that it can take bigger short-haul jets and turning it a real regional
airport, but this must be a long way off.
A number of recent studies have stressed that air services serving the
region require improvement if Devon is to compete effectively at a European
level. Local business leaders in Plymouth point out that the region is
unique on the UK mainland in having so few scheduled international services
within acceptable driving distance of its main industrial centre.
Fast and easy access to Europe by sea is available by the roll on-roll off
(ro-ro) freight and passenger ferries from Plymouth to Roscoff in Brittany
and Santander in northern Spain. Brittany Ferries operates seven-hour
crossings to Roscoff daily, and 25-hour sailings to Santander two or three
times a week. Over Pounds 7m has been spent in recent years on improving
port facilities.
The opening of the Channel tunnel next year is seen as a probable boost to
trade rather than a threat. The belief is that not only will it be cheaper
for regionally-based businesses to send goods direct to France and Spain,
but that congestion on the roads leading to the tunnel will increase
business from the Midlands and the north.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (4): Call it silicon peninsula / Review of
the effort to attract new investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Devon's traditional industries such as defence, agriculture and fishing
in decline, and tourism under threat from foreign competition and
unpredictable summers, the county must create more jobs by attracting new
investment, both from UK companies and from overseas.
Great progress has been made in the last 10 years, especially with an influx
of service industry jobs to Exeter and high tech companies to the Plymouth
area. More is needed to combat the effects of the recession and the run-down
in traditional employment.
'There has been a constant process of companies relocating in the county,
but it has been getting slower,' says Mr Ken Martin, chief executive of the
Devon and Cornwall Development Bureau, which is responsible for investment
from overseas.
'When selling Devon overseas you are also selling the whole of the UK, and
the performance of the national economy is the backdrop against which you
operate . . .at present this is causing problems and until it improves it is
going to affect our business.'
The county's inward investment strategy has been designed to achieve a
better balance of jobs; successes have resulted from an improved
infrastructure and the attractions of a high quality environment and a
skilled workforce.
Relocation has taken a number of forms: straightforward domestic corporate
movement; international arrivals; expansion driven moves, and
rationalisation programmes.
According to a study conducted by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley, the surveyors and
property consultants, relocation activity in Devon is usually traced back to
the move made by London &amp; Manchester Assurance, the insurance and financial
services group; it transferred from London to Exeter in 1976. Since then the
company, with 1,300 employees, has become one of the county's leading
service sector employers, and is also active in the local property
investment market.
Then in 1981, Toshiba, the Japanese electronics company, initiated a big
investment programme in Plymouth, where it now employs over 1,000 people.
One factory supplies the company's entire output of colour television sets
to the UK and European markets, and a second was opened earlier this year to
produce air conditioning units. About half will be exported to Europe.
The Toshiba experience is given as proof of local claims for having one of
the most stable and productive workforces in the country. Toshiba in
Plymouth pioneered Britain's first no-strike agreement and has been
remarkably free of industrial unrest.
Largely because of the example of Toshiba, another leading Japanese
electronics company, Murata Manufacturing, decided to invest Pounds 50m in
building a plant at Plymouth, now in production.
Less clearcut has been the experience with Harris Corporation of America. It
planned to set up a Pounds 120m semi-conductor manufacturing and testing
plant in Plymouth - which would have been the biggest prize so far - but the
company has decided to put the decision on hold because of the world-wide
fall in demand.
But there are now about 70 high technology and many more precision
engineering companies in the county - big names like British Aerospace
Dynamics, Plessey, Northern Telecom and an ICI research laboratory. Such a
heavy concentration, attracted in part by the strong academic and research
base of the universities at Exeter and at Plymouth (where the polytechnic
has been upgraded), has made Devon and Cornwall known as the silicon
peninsula.
This expansion has been mirrored in the machine tool industry, with
investments from Gleason's, Barden Corporation and IBL, supported by a
relocation of Hepco Slide Systems from the London area to manufacture
precision components for machine tools at Tiverton.
The financial services and insurance sectors have grown, too - though not
yet on the scale of other centres in the south-west nearer to London, such
as Bristol. The most notable recent relocation has been that of Medical
Sickness, which moved from London to Exeter a year ago.
Devon county council, Exeter and Plymouth city councils and private
organisations jointly seek to bring in 'sunrise' companies to fill the
vacuum caused by the decline in defence and other traditional industries.
Prime targets are more electronics and precision engineering companies,
healthcare, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology.
Mr Mike Wharton, county industrial development officer, also stresses the
importance for inward investment of retaining assisted area status for
Plymouth and Bude, and reinstating it for Barnstaple and Ilfracombe,
Bideford, Torbay and Totnes in the government review which is about to be
concluded.
Success would mean help in improving the infrastructure, and would make it
easier to attract companies to areas of the county with high unemployment,
including a superb new business park near Barnstaple.
The development bureau, supported by the government, local authorities and
private companies, has a budget of Pounds 900,000. It has staff in Boston
and Tokyo and shares an office in Taiwan with five other English regional
development organisations which, individually, did not have clout similar to
heavily financed Scottish and Welsh agencies.
A small advantage highlighted by Mr Martin is that Devon is a net importer
of goods, which means that there are opportunities for 'backloading,' or
transporting other goods on a return journey. This can give a distinct cost
advantage.
More relevant, though, in attracting investment is the quality and
flexibility of the workforce, good education services, relatively low
development land and wages costs, and intangible factors such as the welcome
given to outsiders moving in, the quality of life, and the willingness of
staff to live in the county.
Devon has been relatively successful in attracting companies from within the
UK and from the US and Japan, but there has been a dearth of newcomers from
Europe. Most of the European companies are there as a result of acquisitions
or mergers, rather than investment in greenfield sites. The development
bureau is aware of the problem and is trying to meet it - but finds
competition increasingly fierce during the recession.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (5): A workforce of good repute - Michiyo
Nakamoto follows the drive towards high-tech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Famed for its rolling hills, spectacular coastline and picturesque villages,
Devon may seem an unlikely location for high technology industries.
In contrast to its image, however, the county, together with its neighbour
Cornwall, has over 70 companies involved in high technology employing more
than 11,000 people.
The Devon and Cornwall Development Board (DCDB), which is responsible for
the region's inward investment, has targeted electronics and precision
manufacturing as two industries it hopes to attract to the region.
Devon and Cornwall account for some 3.3 per cent of total electronics
employment in the UK, even though it has only 2.7 per cent of the total
population, according to a study by Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte, commissioned
by the DCDB.
Many of those companies, ranging from British Aerospace Systems and
Equipment to Toshiba Consumer Electronics of Japan and Harris Semiconductors
of the US, are based in Plymouth, Devon.
'We are beginning to build a base of high-tech companies,' says Mr Ken
Martin, DCDB's chief executive. 'You build a reputation, like Silicon Glen.'
Devon's reputation is built on a number of factors, foremost of which is the
availability of a skilled, hardworking and loyal workforce at competitive
wages.
'Because of other high-tech industries there is a pool of labour that's used
to working in high-tech conditions,' says Mr Jeff Salter, worldwide
marketing communications manager for GEC Plessey Semiconductors, which has a
manufacturing facility in Plymouth.
The Coopers &amp; Lybrand study showed that over 70 per cent of companies
interviewed considered labour turnover to be low or very low while
absenteeism was not regarded as a problem. 'I've worked in Singapore and New
York and from those experiences I had expected higher absenteeism and
turnover but I am very happy with what I have seen so far in Devon,' says Mr
Yoshitsugu Fujiwara, managing director of Murata, the Japanese manufacturer
of electronic components which has a manufacturing operation in Plymouth.
Furthermore, for historical reasons, because it was predominantly
agricultural, the region has been spared much of the labour unrest that has
rocked other parts of the UK.
From a cost perspective, the region's labour costs are about 25 per cent
below levels in other regions of the southeast.
And where staff suitable for a particular task are not available locally,
the beauty of its natural environment helps the region to attract the
necessary people to move there.
Another important asset is the presence of academic institutions. Exeter
University's science faculty - the largest there - specialises in
microprocessor systems, power electronics, and Digital Signal Processing,
while Plymouth University, formerly Polytechnic Southwest, is one of four
centres in the UK awarding a Master of Engineering degree in information
engineering.
But the DCDB has had to work hard to spread the word that Devon could
provide the desired intellectual climate. (There is a general feeling abroad
that the UK has only two universities, Cambridge and Oxford, says Mr
Martin.)
Increasingly, Devon faces intensified competition for inward investment by
high technology companies because of recession, and the changing
circumstances of a Europe marching towards a single market.
The recession has undoubtedly slowed the pace of investment, admits Mr
Martin. While roughly the same number of companies has been expressing
interest in Devon, the time between a company expressing interest and doing
something about it has grown longer.
And for companies looking to supply the wider European market one of the
problems the region faces is the availability of local suppliers and the
time it takes to distribute goods to the rest of the UK and Europe.
Competition for the European market is growing and the speed with which a
company can bring its product to market is becoming a more critical factor
in electronics and other high technology industries.
As a result, access to high quality suppliers and speedy distribution
channels can make the difference between winning and losing.
The Coopers &amp; Lybrand study found that availability of local suppliers was
seen as bad by 5 per cent of respondents, poor by 42 per cent and as only
satisfactory by 30 per cent.
The remaining 23 per cent thought availability was good, rather than
excellent. Nevertheless, 12 per cent of respondents felt that the quality of
the services was excellent, with a further 60 pre cent saying it was good,
and that the main problem was the lack of choice of suppliers and services
within the region.
Furthermore, it was felt that for the sourcing of supplies and the
distribution of products to other parts of the UK and Europe, the transport
infrastructure could be improved.
'If you need a part from South Wales, our competitor will get it in two
hours while we will get it in five,' says one Japanese manufacturer.
Mr Fujiwara at Murata says the company has been encouraging the Plymouth
authorities to build a larger airport.
Another area that could be improved is the overall level of education. 'The
general level of education, which is not as high as in Japan, is a problem
for the whole of the UK,' he says.
If Devon is to continue attracting a high level of inward investment in
competition with a growing number of continental European locations,
improvements to the infrastructure, the development of local suppliers and
services and a high quality educational system are some important areas it
will need to work on.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Most taxpayers happy with Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST two thirds of taxpayers are satisfied with the overall level of
service they get from the Inland Revenue, according to a survey carried out
for the Revenue.
The survey, by Research International, found that 65 per cent were satisfied
and about 10 per cent dissatisfied. About 20 per cent had no strong feelings
either way.
The main priority for taxpayers taking part in the survey was for the Inland
Revenue to get things right the first time. They were also keen that
differences should be resolved quickly.
Issues identified by the survey included the lack of authority of staff to
deal with specific questions and difficulties in getting through to the
right person on the telephone.
The survey also found that taxpayers wanted more information about tax, and
were often unsure about how their tax was worked out.
The Revenue said yesterday that it was looking at measures to strengthen
accuracy and improve the telephone service. Further efforts were being made
to improve letters, forms and leaflets, and measures under consideration
included videos, evening classes and workplace clinics.
Plans announced by the Revenue in March would focus customer service on
high-street offices modelled on building society branches, with clerical
work concentrated in as few as 20 back offices. Frontline staff would be
given the authority to respond to inquiries and resolve queries promptly.
The survey was commissioned by the Revenue as part of its efforts to improve
customer service under the Citizen's Charter. The survey interviewed 1,678
people across the country, including both employees and the self-employed.
Further surveys are planned on the needs of particular groups such as
employers and pensioners and to monitor how well the Revenue is doing in
meeting taxpayers' needs.

FT  14 OCT 92 / DTI knew of Iraqi deal, court is told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS in the Department of Trade and Industry were prepared to 'close
their eyes' when granting an export licence for Matrix Churchill, the
Coventry-based machine tool maker, to sell machinery with a military purpose
to Iraq, an Old Bailey jury heard yesterday.
Mr Paul Henderson, a former managing director of Matrix Churchill, made the
claim when first interviewed by Customs and Excise investigators over the
Iraqi-owned company's alleged breach of export regulations, the court was
told by Mr Alan Moses QC, prosecuting.
Mr Henderson, Mr Trevor Abraham, a former commercial director with the
company, and Mr Peter Allen, a former sales director, all deny four counts
of breaching export controls prohibiting sales of military equipment to
Iraq. The prosecution alleges that the three men deceived the DTI by
pretending the machine tools and associated computer software were for
civilian, not military, use.
Mr Henderson also told his interviewers that Mr Alan Clark, the former trade
minister, had advised machine tool exporters to stress the peaceful
applications of their products when seeking export licences from the DTI, Mr
Moses said.
The advice had been given when Mr Clark met representatives of the Machine
Tool Trade Association, including Mr Henderson, who had expressed concern
that their products might have both civilian and military applications. Mr
Moses said that Mr Henderson had told Customs that Mr Clark had not been
suggesting companies break the law in making applications.
Mr Henderson had also said that when the DTI was considering the
applications from Matrix Churchill, officials there were fully aware of the
activities of Industrias Cardoen, the Chilean intermediary in the
transaction.
When Customs investigators interviewed Mr Allen, he said the DTI had been
aware that the machine tools had a military end use.
Mr Abraham told Customs he had been concerned when he first learned the
equipment was for military use but decided to 'turn a blind eye'. It was one
of the difficulties of working for an Iraqi-owned company such as
Matrix-Churchill, he had said.
Earlier, the court heard that to obtain export credit guarantees for the
transaction, Matrix Churchill was supported by a letter of credit from the
Banca Nazionale de Lavoro in Atlanta, US.
The trial continues today.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Rise in university student numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE of the growing pressure of increased student numbers on
universities comes with the publication today of the latest management
statistics from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals and the
Universities Funding Council, John Willman writes.
The ratio of students to staff rose to 11.89 in 1990-91, almost 19 per cent
higher than in 1984. The ratio varies considerably between subjects, ranging
from an average of 9.4 in physics to 19.4 in accountancy.
The figures cover the 52 'old' universities in the UK, excluding
polytechnics that became universities this year.
The proportion of university income that comes from student fees has
increased from 9 per cent in 1989-90 to 16 per cent in 1990-91, while the
direct grant from government has fallen from 48 per cent to 39 per cent.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Review of national grid payments ordered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR STEPHEN Littlechild, the electricity industry regulator, yesterday
ordered a review of the way the national grid pays for electricity from some
power stations.
His announcement came in a report stating that customers are not adequately
protected by the present system.
The report about constrained-on plant - extra generating plant required only
infrequently to boost supplies with electricity charged at premium rates -
identifies possible cost-cutting measures.
They include greater investment in the network to reduce shortages in
supplies, the introduction of voluntary demand-reduction schemes by
industry, and a possible change in the pattern of ownership of generating
plant.
Prof Littlechild also accepts the recommendation of the Commons energy
committee that he should consider by 1995 at the latest whether the leading
generators should be referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
'Their prices and profits will be relevant in making this decision and in
the timing of it,' he writes in the report.
The share price of PowerGen fell 6p to 280p and National Power was down 4p
at 269p.
The regulator is unhappy about the way some generating stations, the
constrained-on plants, are allowed to charge high rates in return for
stabilising supplies. They operate outside the normal power bidding system
and can be much more profitable when required.
The report, which follows an Offer report last December on electricity pool
prices, says payments for constrained-on plants in 1991-92 amounted to more
than Pounds 200m, an increase of more than 70 per cent on the previous year.
The report focuses on 14 National Power and PowerGen stations that each
received payments of Pounds 10m or more. Five - Fawley and Didcot for
National Power, Ferrybridge B, Hams Hall and Castle Donington for PowerGen -
received more than Pounds 30m each.
Most of the stations were older and less fuel-efficient coal-fired plants,
although the report finds that some large, modern oil-fired plants had also
bid high prices when transmission constraints were active and there was a
sharp demand for electricity.
Prof Littlechild says of the present system: 'It does not provide adequate
protection for customers.
'In a competitive market, customers should not have to rely on generators
adopting self-imposed codes of conduct to limit their bidding.'
National Power said its policy was to recover each station's costs plus a
reasonable contribution to overheads and profits. 'We have adopted a clear
and consistent policy not to exploit our position with regard to our
constrained-on plant,' it said.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Insurers poised to move to Lloyd's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE companies in significant numbers are poised to move their
operations in the London market to the Lloyd's of London building,
underlining growing links between Lloyd's and the conventional company
insurance market.
A number of companies - including Anglo American and American International
Group - are already close to signing agreements to rent space on the third
floor of Lloyd's. Altogether, 20 companies have expressed interest in moving
to the market's glass-and-steel headquarters.
The greater physical integration between Lloyd's and the London company
market comes as Lloyd's works on the possible attraction of corporate
capital to the market in the wake of last January's Rowland task force
report.
The Lloyd's council recently introduced regulations allowing syndicates to
make more use of outside reinsurers.
Lloyd's is keen to increase rental income after a fall in the number of
syndicates at the market. More than 120 syndicates have either closed or
merged in the past 18 months, leaving one of the four underwriting floors
vacant and another under-occupied.
Office space at Lloyd's is much more expensive than elsewhere in London,
even though the figure of Pounds 125 a sq ft includes all services costs
apart from telecommunications, according to Mr Nick Phillips, general
manager of property at Lloyd's.
But if companies operate on the same basis as Lloyd's syndicates (running
their underwriting operations in an open-plan office alongside other
insurers), they are likely to occupy less space than they would do in a
typical office.
Companies could also win greater amounts of business by being attached to
Lloyd's, which Mr Phillips described as 'a mecca for brokers'. Insurance
companies rented offices at Lloyd's previous headquarters in Lime Street
until 1986, although they did not operate like Lloyd's underwriters.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Casino group's gaming licences opposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPANIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN ASPINALL, the casino operator, has objected to the application by
London Clubs, the casino group that owns the Ritz Club and Les Ambassadeurs
in the capital, for renewal of its gaming licences.
The objection by Mr Aspinall has come as a surprise to London Clubs, which
had hoped that the hearing of its application by magistrates on October 19
would proceed smoothly after the Gaming Board's recent decision to grant
certificates of consent for its six casinos. Certificates of consent
indicate that the board considers a casino fit to operate and paves the way
for magistrates to grant gaming licences.
Mr Aspinall, whose new casino opens in London on October 20, argues that
approval of new licences for London Clubs is such an important decision for
British gaming that the issues ought to be aired in open court.
London Clubs, whose future had been clouded by uncertainty after a police
raid on its Mayfair casinos in June last year, has undergone a
transformation under its new chairman, Sir Gordon Booth, a former diplomat.
The company has always denied any wrongdoing.
After the previous management team, led by Mr Max Kingsley, resigned at the
end of April, new directors were brought in and efforts were made to meet
the Gaming Board objections to the company's operating procedures.
One decision was to stop granting complimentary services for overseas
players, such as payment of air fares and hotel bills, a practice understood
to have worried the Gaming Board, although the company had claimed the
practice was perfectly proper.
The new management convinced the Gaming Board that it was 'fit and proper'
to keep its licences and was granted certificates of consent for its six
casinos, which are now set up as separate units instead of as a single
entity. The company had assumed that the police would take the same view as
the board and not pursue their objections.
While the new licences are expected to be granted, the future of London
Clubs remains dependent on the magistrates' hearing.
Mr Aspinall's intervention is thought unlikely to alter the outcome but may
lengthen the hearing.

FT  14 OCT 92 / BBC audiences 'to fall'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC faces a substantial loss of its share of television audiences by the
end of the decade, according to a series of independent forecasts.
Paying For Broadcasting, a new book containing studies commissioned by the
corporation, says vigorous competition might leave the BBC with 32 per cent
of viewing by the year 2000. It currently has about 42 per cent.
According to the study, the ITV share in 2000 would be 34 per cent, Channel
4 would have 8 per cent and the combined share of Channel 5 - if it goes
ahead - and cable and satellite channels would be 26 per cent.
The revenue flowing to the ITV companies in 2000 may not be very different
in real terms from the equivalent 1988 figure - about Pounds 1.7bn - which
will put increasing pressure on the production of high-cost programmes,
according to the book.
In one study, Mr Gavyn Davies, chief economist of Goldman Sachs, and Mr
Andrew Graham, an Oxford economics tutor, argue that the licence fee should
be linked to unit labour costs in the private service sector rather than to
the retail prices index.
If the licence fee was uprated with the RPI, the BBC's market share would
probably decline to less than 30 per cent by the year 2000 and to only 20
per cent by 2010.
The study argues that if the BBC were to sell two minutes of advertising
every hour, expanding total air time by 13 per cent, it would not lead to an
overall increase in advertising revenue. By the year 2000, total revenue
would fall to a predicted Pounds 2.382bn, Pounds 37m less than forecasts for
a market where the BBC did not take advertising.
Mr Tony Hall, BBC director of news and current affairs, last night claimed
that the introduction of the planned 24-hour radio news service would give
listeners more choice. Both Radio 4 on FM and BBC Radio News on long wave
would carry the main news and current-affairs programmes from Today in the
morning through to the Midnight News. Mr Hall told the Royal Television
Society that there would be an increase in business news with three
half-hour programmes a day.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Litigation threat to auditors outlined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL action against auditors is the most serious threat facing the
accounting profession, the World Congress of Accountants in Washington heard
yesterday.
Mr David Smithers, president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in
Australia, said: 'Unless we solve the problem of liability there will not be
another World Congress.'
Mr Smithers was discussing the recent ADollars 1.1bn claim against KPMG Peat
Marwick as auditors to Tricontinental, the merchant banking arm of the State
Bank of Australia. Total outstanding claims in the country now exceed
ADollars 2.6bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
That case was overshadowed this month by the Pounds 8bn claim against Ernst
&amp; Whinney and Price Waterhouse in London for their role as auditors to Bank
of Credit and Commerce International, which collapsed last year.
Speakers said an important role in controlling litigation could be played by
auditors using more sophisticated risk management in chosing clients. Mr
Smithers said nearly half of litigation was driven by poor risk management.
Mr Richard Murray, chairman of Minet Global Professional Services, the
indemnity insurer, stressed that auditors did not cause financial losses,
but were finding themselves held responsible for them when a collapse took
place.
He said insurers were at the point of refusing to provide professional
indemnity cover for accountants, and that there might be a need for
governments to step in.

FT  14 OCT 92 / PM urged to clarify Jubilee Line plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF'S administrators yesterday wrote to Mr John Major, the prime
minister, urging him to clarify government policy on the planned extension
to the Jubilee Line and the relocation of civil servants to the financially
troubled east London property development.
The administrators - three partners of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm -
reiterated that Canary Wharf's banks are keen to make a financial
contribution to the Pounds 1.6bn costs of building the Underground
extension.
They want Mr Major to arbitrate in a dispute between government departments
about whether civil servants should move to Canary Wharf and whether the
line should be built.
On Monday evening, the administrators were told by Lord Wakeham - leader of
the House of Lords, who is in charge of a special government Docklands
committee - that more than 2,000 Department of Environment officials are
unlikely to move to Canary Wharf, confounding earlier expectations.
However, Lord Wakeham left open the possibility that officials from other
departments would move to Docklands.
'We have written to the prime minister to ensure that our message gets
across to interested parties,' the administrators said. 'It is not a panic
measure.'
Canary Wharf's bankers fear that the government will abandon the Jubilee
Line project - which would have a detrimental effect on the value of the
development.
The banks' existing offer of Pounds 390m towards the Jubilee Line costs is
conditional on civil servants being moved to Canary Wharf.

FT  14 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: US stake in BP tops 20%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO PETER JOHN and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRUGGLING oil major British Petroleum saw keen interest from US investors.
That interest has taken the US stake above 20 per cent for the first time
according to the latest available figures.
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull, quoting BP sources, said yesterday that
the number of shares held in the form of American Depositary Receipts had
hit 20.5 per cent, compared with only 7.5 per cent a year ago. Both figures
include a 3.74 per cent stake which is part of the Kuwait Investment Office
holding in the company.
Strauss's Mr John Toalster, generally regarded as the superbear on the
stock, said yesterday; 'US investors continue to regard the company as
attractive against the US oil majors whereas compared to Shell it is
expensive. UK institutions are further underweight.' The two-way view on the
stock was in evidence for most of the day and despite the heaviest closing
turnover of the day - 16 million shares - BP rose only 1 1/2 to 219p. Shell
Transport also firmed 1 1/2 to 524 1/2 p.
Generators weak
The UK generators were under pressure after the electricity regulator Offer
published a document criticising their pricing. There was also a response to
worries of a national coal strike. PowerGen, which came in for the stronger
criticism, fell 6 to 280p and National Power lost 4 to 269p.
Analysts said the market was particularly concerned by what it took to be a
threat that the duopoly could be broken up. The threat was contained in the
final sentence of the report which said Offer was considering the 'pattern
of ownership'. However, Mr Kevin Lapwood of Nomura argued that this had been
misinterpreted and merely referred to the geographical imbalance of the
industry. Most power stations are in the North of England.
The prospects of a coal strike as a result of pit closure announcements
would not directly hurt the generators as there are massive coal stock
piles. However, it would suck them in to a political storm.
Insurance switch
Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest insurance group measured by market
capitalisation, came under persistent pressure after Robert Fleming
Securities told clients to switch out of Prudential and into Legal &amp;
General, the third biggest of the UK's life companies.
There were also market stories that stockbroker Credit Lyonnais Laing had
cut its profits estimates for Prudential.
Prudential shares retreated to 261p before stabilising with the market and
closing 2 better at 269 on turnover of 2m shares. Legal &amp; General advanced
17 to 364p.
Flemings insurance team said the life sector was too high and Prudential,
which has approached its actual and relative all-time high, should be
switched into Legal for a 'massive yield pick up.'
News that Abbey National was cutting its mortgage rate may have helped the
market, but it left the bank's shares unchanged at 315p.
Speculation of an imminent sale for its merchant bank arm helped Royal Bank
of Scotland improve 8 to 161p. Some analysts suggested that a European
consortium headed by German bank BHF was poised to launch an offer. However,
others argued that the shares were merely responding to recent falls.
Early hopes that perennial bid target TSB might attract an offer evaporated
on closer scrutiny and the shares closed only 2 better at 137 1/2 p.
The big water companies were under pressure in response to growing worries
of a head-to-head confrontation with the official regulator Ofwat,
highlighted by a Nomura sell recommendation. North West Water lost 3 to
442p, Thames fell 4 to 438p and Anglian dropped 3 to 420p.
British Gas, which is prompting diverging views, closed 4 up at 256 1/2 p.
Three leading securities houses were said to be recommending the stock and a
fourth, Smith New Court, published a sell note yesterday. Smith believes the
'earnings growth picture is extremely uncertain due to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission investigation'.
Recent Footsie 100 entrant Burmah recovered recent losses and gained 15 to
648p as a squeeze on the stock was helped by tenuous bid speculation and a
buy recommendation from agency broker James Capel following a visit to the
company.
Grand Metropolitan bounced 6 to 376p, and Guinness was reported a good
market, the shares moving 15 ahead to 541p, in trade of 3.4m shares.
Argyll Group and J. Sainsbury moved strongly ahead after BZW reiterated its
buy recommendation on the stocks on the basis of an increase in food
inflation driven by sterling's effective devaluation. The former gained 14
to 364p, while the latter jumped 17 to 487p, after trade of 2.1m shares.
Securities house Nomura, however, took a contrary view on Sainsbury and
advised investors to switch out of it and into Tesco, which added 10 to
242p. Mr Andy Hughes at Nomura believes there is more upside in Tesco given
the big rating differential.
Asda Group closed unchanged at 39p, with bid speculation once again doing
the rounds. Turnover reached 9.8m, with the equivalent of over another 3m
shares dealt in the traded options.
Body Shop had a volatile session. The shares fell 7 in early trading after
the cosmetics retailer revealed a fall in interim profits from Pounds 9.15m
to Pounds 8.26m. Then, a lunchtime meeting with institutions steadied nerves
and the shares recovered to end 2 up at 163p.
A big report from SG Warburg on the hotels and leisure sector re-emphasising
the broker's caution on the sector cast a shadow over it. Forte shed 4 to
153p. Ladbroke was also affected though more serious damage was done by
reports that Smith New Court had taken on a line of stock in the group. The
shares fell 9 to 154p on turnover of 5.1m.
News of an increased number of visitors to Euro - Disney, sent the shares
sharply ahead. The company announced that visitors had topped the 7m mark
and beat its September forecast.
The shares jumped 50 to 860p, in thin trade. Analysts however remained
sceptical, pointing out the rise in the figures coincided with the end of
the school holidays.
Wellcome was sharply lower at the start of trading on concerns that a drug
being developed by Glaxo could affect Wellcome's Retrovir. There was also
disappointment that the US holding in the company had fallen to 6.8 per cent
from a 8.7 per cent stake at the time of its share offer in July. The shares
were off 20 at their worst, but some analysts argued that Retrovir would
always be the main component in any AIDS treatment and the shares recovered
to close 7 lower at 956p. Glaxo jumped 15 to 791p.
A meeting in New York to publicise its two new electronic dealing systems
helped Reuters Holdings improve 18 to 1282p.
Dealers said awareness of Carlton Communications, the group which is to take
over the London TV franchise from Thames, continues to grow. Carlton shares
lifted 15 to 683p.
Mirror Group Newspapers fell 2 to 63p as investors took profits after the
publisher unveiled first half-results.
Speculation that GKN would soon win an order from Kuwait for its Warrior
armoured personnel carriers lifted the shares 13 to 373p.

FT  14 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in the derivatives markets remained at relatively low levels but
picked up substantially during the afternoon when business expanded rapidly,
writes Steve Thompson.
The late surge came after Abbey National cut its mortgage loan rates in a
move interpreted by the market as the forerunner of another cut in UK
interest rates.
In stock index futures, the December contract opened at 2,612 and drifted
back to the 2,588 level in very quiet trading, before stabilising and edging
back up to the 2,600 mark over the lunchtime period.
The afternoon however saw the market transformed by the Abbey news, Footsie
bid speculation and a sharp opening rise on Wall Street, sending the market
sharply better and producing a flurry of buying.
This moved the contract from the 2,600 level to 2,640 in a ten minute period
and it ended a volatile session at 2,641, 21 points above its fair value
premium to cash, estimated at 32 points. Turnover, although up on Monday's
5,896 contracts, totalled a disappointing 7,795 contracts.
In traded options, total volume reached 25,991 contracts, with the FT-SE 100
option trading 9,170 lots. Dealers noted the continuing heavy activity in
Asda stock options which topped the actives list for the second consecutive
session with 3,318 contracts traded. Tesco options were also active, with
1,479 contracts traded.

FT  14 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Abbey loan rate cut boosts market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UK EQUITY market still suffering from lack of turnover and enthusiasm
burst into life in mid-afternoon following an unexpected mortgage rate cut
by Abbey National, a sharp rise on Wall Street and speculation that a
takeover involving a Footsie stock could be imminent. This combination drove
the Footsie up 27.5 to 2,584.7.
Markets were additionally helped by another good showing by sterling in the
foreign exchange markets, notably against the dollar but also against the
D-mark. The strength of the pound gave a strong boost to the gilt-edged
market where long dated stocks rose around a point.
Share prices started brightly with marketmakers hoisting prices in response
to a good overnight performance by Wall Street.
The Footsie 100 opened with a 10 point gain at 2,567.2, but this was eroded
in mid-morning by a sell programme, estimated to have been worth some Pounds
45m and executed by one of the more aggressive of the UK integrated
securities houses. The effects of the programme, which featured big blocks
of Cable &amp; Wireless, BT, British Gas, Marks &amp; Spencer and Guinness, lingered
for much of the session but the immediate result was to pull the Footsie 100
back to the day's low point of 2,549.5, or down 7.7 just before lunch.
Very little genuine business was transacted until the Abbey National news
came into the market. The effect was immediate and dramatic, with the
Footsie future jumping 40 points and driving the cash market sharply better.
The Footsie 100 galloped ahead and peaked at 2,587.7 just ahead of the
official close, with stories of a Footsie bid gaining an ever-growing
audience.
The bid stories encompassed a wide spectrum but were sharply focused on the
banking arena. TSB, where takeover stories have rumbled on since the group's
problems with its Hill Samuel merchant banking subsidiary and its ill-fated
acquisition of the Target Life became public, was one of the potential bid
targets. Standard Chartered and Royal Bank of Scotland also came into the
picture, although dealers remained highly sceptical of any early moves in
the banks, highlighting the relative low levels of activity in all the
so-called takeover candidates.
Other Footsie names regarded as vulnerable included Fisons, the chemicals
group, and Asda, the food retailer. Actual takeover news lifted shares in
fund management group Henderson Administration, involved in merger talks
with Touche Remnant.
Utilities were unsettled by the report issued by the electricity industry
watchdog, Offer. The report triggered big selling of the power generators
and undermined sentiment in the regional electricity companies. Other weak
performers in the Footsie included BICC, the heavy electrical and cables
group which suffered from a Cazenove sell recommendation, and Forte, the
hotels group, which weakened after a less than enthusiastic recommendation
from Warburg Securities.
Equity turnover picked up well during the late afternoon but remained
unsatisfactory at 470.5m shares. Monday's 305m-share turnover resulted in a
meagre Pounds 625m-worth of customer business.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Cautious trading in US dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR oscillated in a two pfennig range against the D-Mark yesterday as
dealers analysed different messages in Europe and the US about the American
currency's future, writes James Blitz.
The possibility that the Bundesbank will ease official interest rates at its
council meeting tomorrow continued to support the dollar. The German central
bank again injected liquidity into the market at the rate of 8.9 per cent,
60 basis points below the Lombard rate ceiling, suggesting that the rate
differential between the US and Germany is set to narrow.
But, whatever happens in Frankfurt, there will probably be a firm cap on the
dollar between now and the US presidential election on November 3. Mr Neil
MacKinnon, chief economist at Citibank in London, believes that the dollar
is trapped in a DM1.45-DM1.50 range until then.
He is much more positive for the dollar after that, believing that the
US-German differentials in economic growth and interest rates will narrow.
'I see a DM1.67 target over the next six months,' he said.
Mr Mark Slater, head of foreign exchange at Merrill Lynch in London, agrees.
He believes that the dollar is already supported by a flood of players who
do not want to be left out of the upward rush when it comes.
In his view, a victory for Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic challenger, is
now being seen more positively by dealers. 'That would mean having a a
Democratic President and Congress,' he said. 'Rather than having a lame duck
president, you might have one who gets things done.'
The dollar closed at DM1.4680 against the D-Mark, down less than  1/2 a
pfennig on the day. In New York trading at lunchtime, it was at DM1.4700.
Sterling continued to consolidate above DM2.50, helped by the UK
chancellor's renewed emphasis on supporting the exchange rate when he
appeared before British MPs on Monday. The pound closed at DM2.5200, up
nearly a pfennig on the day.
In spite of Mr Lamont's comments, there is a feeling that the UK is moving
into a position where it could cut interest rates without damaging the
pound. Yesterday's UK producer prices figures for September showed the
lowest monthly rise in 25 years, indicating that the disinflationary
momentum in the UK is very great. Mr MacKinnon believes that retail price
inflation could now be easily contained to 3 1/2 per cent next year.
He believes that dealers will now invest in countries which show signs of
growth. One analyst said yesterday: 'European countries may now compete to
cut rates significantly below German levels. Those that end up cutting rates
too late will find that an easing has already been priced into the market.'

FT  14 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Another small ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONEY market rates in both the UK and Germany eased again yesterday as
dealers continued to believe that a cut in both countries' official rates
may follow tomorrow's Bundesbank council meeting, writes James Blitz.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, gave the markets the impression that UK
credit policy would lean on the tight side in his testimony to MPs on
Monday. However, sterling dealers saw new clues to a near-term easing of
rates yesterday.
The currency consolidated its position above DM2.50, peaking at DM2.5390 to
the D-Mark at noon in London. A strengthening pound gives the UK government
more room to introduce another base rate cut, without this having an impact
on inflation.
Yesterday's monthly figure for factory gate price rises was also the lowest
in 25 years, indicating that inflationary pressures in the economy are very
weak. Output prices were unchanged against economists' forecasts of a 0.1
per cent rise.
The Bundesbank injected liquidity into the German money market at a rate of
8.9 per cent yesterday, further underlining the easier German policy on
market rates, now 60 basis points below the Lombard rate ceiling.
These developments registered in cash and futures prices. Three month
sterling cash closed at 8 5/8 per cent, down from a previous close of 8 per
cent. The December short sterling contract closed at 91.92 from a previous
close of 91.89. The December Euromark contract registered new bullishness
about the Bundesbank council meeting, rising 10 basis points to 91.76.
Several dealers offered bills below established rates to the Bank of England
at the start of UK money market operations, but said the offers were turned
down. The speculation over a rate cut was reflected in the fact that only
Pounds 2m of Band 1 bank bills were bought at the established rate of 8 7/8
per cent in the early round.
The Pounds 800m shortage was later removed with the purchase of Pounds 440m
and Pounds 282m of Band 1 bank bills in the morning and afternoon.
One clearing bank dealer said that if there were no rate cuts before Friday,
the market would unwind the recent mark-down of rates. 'I would expect the
December futures contract to fall 10 basis points,' he said.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (9): The aim is to come top - Higher
education has come of age
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY ANDREW ADONIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER education in Devon has finally come of age.
Forty years ago, the county could boast only an Exeter-based outpost of the
University of London, not allowed to award degrees in its own right until
1955. A decade later came a polytechnic at Plymouth. This summer,
Polytechnic South-West was transformed into the University of Plymouth under
the government's policy of ending the formal segmentation of higher
education.
'We were top of the poly league; now we are aiming for the top of the
university league,' says Mr John Bull, vice-chancellor of the new
university.
But he stresses that he has 'zero intention' of abandoning the old
polytechnic mission of promoting vocationally-oriented study and part-time
and mature student courses. 'We remain committed to ensuring that teaching
and research are directed to the needs of communities we serve.'
A few figures graphically. spell out those needs. About a fifth of the
university's 15,000 students are aged 25 or over; nearly half (excluding
those on short courses) come from the south-west; almost half are women;
agriculture, food, land use, business, education, science and technology
account for almost all its courses; and around a third of its students study
for the Higher National Diploma (HND), the top branch of the vocational
tree.
For Plymouth University, widening access is not simply a matter of
encouraging a broader range of applications: it means moving out -
physically - into the local community. A series of mergers in the late-1980s
brought it a college of education in Exmouth, the Art and Design College of
Exeter, and the Seale-Hayne Agricultural College at Newton Abbot. That gives
it four campuses in all, to which should be added a dozen or more
institutions - mostly further education colleges  - in Devon and the
surrounding counties with which it has partnership or franchise
arrangements.
The university's growth has been extraordinarily rapid: it has almost
doubled its student numbers since gaining independence from Devon County
Council in 1989. With an income target of Pounds 60m this year, it has taken
on a Pounds 12m capital spending programme financed entirely from its own
resources and borrowing. 'Independence has been a remarkable stimulus to
growth - particularly the funding council's encouragement to us to take
students funded by fees only,' says Mr Bull.
The former polytechnics emphasise teaching, not research. Plymouth
University, though, exploits its science focus through a research and
consultancy subsidiary called PEP Ltd. 'Most of our Pounds 1m turnover comes
from close-to-market or government-funded projects,' says Mr Peter Webber,
its principal consultant. Current projects include the design of software
tools for flexible manufacturing, for which partners include Du Pont, a
Belgian subsidiary of the US company; Jaguar, the British motor company, and
Harland Simon (formerly John Brown Automation).
Exeter University, too, emphasises its business and industrial links. Exeter
Enterprises Limited, its consultancy arm, recently won a Pounds 100,000
Department of Trade grant to help it expand over the next three years, which
it intends to use to open offices in Plymouth and to create a trading arm
for its Biotechnology Research Group.
Exeter University is unashamedly a national university - less than 10 per
cent of its students come from Devon - and competition for places is strong.
Its expansion has been glacial by Plymouth standards: full-time student
numbers are at 7,000 rising by about 150 a year, with the number of academic
staff up 100 on a decade ago. Education is its biggest department, under the
direction of the ebullient Professor Ted Wragg.
The university has just finished a multi-million pound project to provide
accommodation for an extra 600 students. It is determined not to expand
faster than its capacity to provide residential accommodation for almost all
its intake.
Dr David Harrison, Exeter's vice-chancellor, is keen to deepen the
university's regional roots, but not at the expense of its national stature.
'We are concerned to recruit effectively north of the Trent, something we
have not been particularly good at hitherto,' he says. Unsurprisingly, he is
not enthusiastic about two year degrees or a re-structured academic year,
and wants to keep small seminar groups of less than 10 as the norm for
undergraduate teaching. 'Students, you know, are even more conservative on
these kind of issues than we are,' he adds with a smile.
Endowed with an impressive central site and 240 acres, Exeter university
combines the virtues of the campus and the city-centre university. First
year students mostly live in halls of residence, with self-catering
accommodation available for most students in subsequent years.
The university has a strong research focus. Dr Harrison has been resolute in
concentrating its 'loose' research funding on departments highly rated by
the Universities Funding Council, and he sees next February - when new
research-quality ratings and a revised funding formula for teaching take
effect - as 'a crunch date for us.' 'It may be that a few departments will
be in for a shock,' he says. Since departments are also cost centres, the
lower-rated could be obliged to pack in more students to maintain their
income.
Besides its main campus in Devon, Exeter University has an Institute of
Cornish Studies in Camborne, Cornwall, carrying out research on Cornwall's
economy and society as well as its cultural heritage. The university is also
taking over the Camborne School of Mines, which will become part of its
school of engineering.
Exeter also boasts the first professorship of Complementary Medicine in
Europe. Established this summer with a Pounds 1.5m donation from the Maurice
Laing Foundation, the chair will strengthen its pioneering Centre for
Complementary Health Studies.

FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (10): Less cream, more jobs - North Devon is
working hard to promote itself
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS more to North Devon than cows, Clovelly (the area's most
photographed picture postcard village) and cream teas.
This is the cri de coeur coming from local councils, pulling out all the
stops to encourage new industry to come to the region. The growth in
unemployment in North Devon, according to its Member of Parliament, Nick
Harvey, is the highest of any 'travel to work area' in the country.
In fact, no big industrial companies have started up here since 1984, when
the region lost its assisted area status. A reversal of this decision, which
local organisations now urgently seek, would unlock the door to government
help for new and existing companies, offer a carrot for others to come to
the area, and give an entree to European funds for improving infrastructure.
Geographically, north Devon (which is covered by two district councils,
North Devon and Torridge) stretches from Bude on the Cornish border in the
west, to Lynton in the north and Okehampton in the south.
It is a small-business community. 'One of our problems, when it comes to
attracting manufacturing industry, is that we're seen by too many people as
the place where people come for a holiday, and we're not known for what else
we have to offer,' says Mr Eric Dancer, managing director of Dartington
Crystal, one of the larger employers.
He believes, too, that the area is insufficiently competitive with other
counties in what it has to offer, and he is forming a West Country
development agency to attract new money in a coordinated way, identifying
unemployment black spots and the action needed to improve them. It will also
provide an umbrella for all the organisations at present involved in
requesting assisted area status. If people contemplate coming to Devon, Mr
Dancer says, they will now find that the local community district council
and industrial associations will work overtime to make them welcome.
Mr Bob Hall, North Devon District's chief executive, is committed to
industrial development. He has just appointed Mr Peter Lyons as the
council's first economic development officer, 'A year ago,' Mr Hall says,
'we saw a local pharmaceutical manufacturer - then American-owned, and
employing 460 people - announce it was closing down. With a 15 per cent
increase in long term unemployment in the area, and several other companies
shedding jobs, this was a spur for us to get involved in economic
development. We now have 30 to 40 acres of industrial estates lined up and
ready to go.'( In fact the company was saved by a management buy-out.)
Peter Lyons comes from a background of industry, not local government. 'I
didn't want anyone from local authority,' says Bob Hall. 'I wanted someone
who had held senior positions in business and manufacturing. What we have to
do now is get the message through that north Devon is not as remote as some
people think, that we're actually keen on seeing development and growth.
With a budget of Pounds 50,000 it would be unrealistic to say we're going to
make a huge impact, but we are committed to it and people should come and
see what we have to offer.'
What does the area have to offer prospective companies? A skilled and
willing work force with a history of good industrial relations; available
sites; low costs; a college providing training opportunities for local
employers and small business start-ups; a pleasant environment, and improved
road transport brought about three years ago with the opening of a new link
road from the M5 to Bideford - although it is still necessary to improve the
county's north/south road links.
A project further to the south is Torridge's twinning with North Finistere
in France. This is aimed, says Richard Brasington, the chief executive, at
hard-headed commercial development, with both sides learning from each
other's expertise in the industry and tourism fields. A shop in Finestere is
already selling Devon products, seminars will be held this month and next in
both countries - and Torridge has run a course of French lessons for those
taking part.
Links are being formed, too, with Rugen in North Germany, an Objective l
Area in European regional development policies. 'Such a tripartite link,' Mr
Brasington says, 'will potentially give us greater access to European
funding for infrastructure development here.'
He accepts the paradox that the area might be spoilt by bringing in
industrial development, 'But we're a hundred light years away from that. We
could comfortably establish six large new industries on industrial estates
in and around our district without making any impact on the environment, and
as sites are already allocated, it wouldn't be a question of encroaching on
the countryside.'
Mr David Pinney, the district planning officer, says the council will help
if troubleshooting is needed with the water and highway authorities, and
will act for companies as much as it can. 'It's all about positive planning
and making things happen. If we can't get the economic side right, we can
pick up and go home.'
A company that has got it right and employs a large number of local people
is Appledore Shipbuilders, acquired in 1972 by Langham Industries whose
managing director at Appledore, Mr Jim Wilson, has raised a Pounds 12m
turnover in 1972 to Pounds 28m last year. But it has lost big orders because
of difficulty in financing guarantees and lack of government support. It
really gets to me that this government doesn't take a more patriotic stance
to help its citizens,' Mr Wilson says.
Whatever the government is not doing, north Devon is certainly committed to
encouraging manufacturing industry into its area. Peter Lyons would like it
to have a single common identity to cover both tourism and industrial
development promotion. 'We must think up something direct and meaningful and
produce better publicity material for targeting overseas companies,' says Mr
Lyons. 'We have to go out there with something to say.'

FT  14 OCT 92 / Survey of Devon (8): Pleasure in diversity - Angela
Wigglesworth joins the tourist beat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGELA WIGGLESWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT brings 3.5m visitors to Devon each year?
The answer lies in the diversity of what the county has to offer: wide
surfing and sandy beaches, pretty villages, the resorts of Torquay, Brixham
and Paignton and attractive old towns of Totnes, Dartmouth and Salcombe. For
excellent wet weather facilities you have Plymouth and Exeter. There are the
wild, open spaces of Dartmoor and Exmoor, the coastal paths on the South
West Way Peninsula Walk and any number of sporting facilities. Publicity
brochures list 300 tourist attractions, and accommodation ranges from low
cost to luxury.
But although the number of visitors has fallen this year - and those who
came have spent less - Devon is awash with new schemes to care for the
countryside and prevent tourists from destroying places they come to enjoy.
The Devon Action for Tourism and the Environment (DATE) is an initiative
from the county council; the Dartmoor Area Tourist Initiative (DATI) is a
public and private sector partnership providing village, town and farm
interpretations, guided walks, grant-aided conservation work, public
transport initiatives, and a Green Business Guide for tourism businesses to
adopt a go-green policy.
On Exmoor, the National Park authorities are coordinating public transport
to make it easier for visitors to use. National Trust is using car parks as
tools to keep people away from 'honeypots'; the Devon and Cornwall Rail
project seeks to make local transport services (the Tamar Valley line and
the Tarka Line) more viable for visitors; the Tarka Trail, now being
developed, will be a long-distance walking and cycling route along a disused
railway track linking Exmoor and Dartmoor.
'Celebrate the Countryside,' to be launched on November 9, seeks to
encourage people to speak of the West Country as a rural rather than seaside
resort destination. 'While this is a marketing campaign,' says Janet
Reynolds, the county council's tourism development officer, 'it will enable
us to find out what people want, and we hope ultimately to have a system
into which private sector operators put money to fund local projects.'
This summer, South Devon's green efforts (which include, in Torbay, using
energy-saving 12 volts instead of 250 for its illuminations) were rewarded
when the area was chosen to be a national pilot for an English Tourist Board
project to promote environmentally friendly tourism. The country's
first-ever Green Tourism officer will be appointed soon.
'I think this is the missing link,' says Sue Beswick, marketing and tourist
officer for South Hams, one of the areas in the scheme. 'The advantage of
having a specific officer is that he or she will be able to get and talk to
the industry. It's all very well telling hoteliers they should use
enviromentally friendly products, but what are they going to cost and where
do they get them?'
Up in North Devon, many involved in the tourism industry feel the area does
not have a high enough profile, and that local councils should spend more on
marketing it. Mr Gordon Moore, who manages the Clovelly Visitors Centre and
is chairman of the Devon Association of Tourist Attractions says that
although tourism is the biggest industry in North Devon, the two councils
covering the area (North Devon and Torridge) only spend about Pounds 120,000
in total on promoting it, and the figures should be doubled.
At The Milky Way, near Clovelly, where the Stanbury family turned their
dairy farm into a successful tourist attraction when ruin stared them in the
face after the introduction of milk quotas in 1984, Mr Trevor Stanbury feels
that, as most Torridge councillors do not work in tourism, they cannot see
the benefits.
There are problems, too, with planners. Nick Harvey, the North Devon MP,
believes they are over-protective and not sufficiently flexible. The North
Devon link road, which opened three years ago, cut into the wilderness to
replace the old road with its pubs and hotels.
No one uses this one now, but the local authority is refusing permission for
hoteliers and publicans to put up directional signs on the new road to tell
visitors what facilities are available nearby which would make their stay in
Devon more enjoyable. 'Some of the villagers are pleased to be passed by,'
Nick Harvey admits.
The holiday resort in Devon which probably has the most problems is
Ilfracombe. Unemployment is 22 per cent (its largest increase was over the
last year - top of the national league).
A few hotels are feeling the recession so much that they are advertising to
people on social security in Liverpool with the message: why be out of work
in Liverpool when you can be out of work in Devon? (People have already
responded - and come, causing intense controversy in the town.)
The chief executive, Bob Hall, admits Ilfracombe needs to be served by a
better road system - but as this would cost Pounds 32m and the council has
Pounds 8m a year to spend, it is not likely to get it.
The town's decaying Victorian theatre will have to close in two years time
unless it is rescued by a private developer, because there is no public
money to restore it. Mr Nigel Smith, the tourism officer, admits the town
needs millions spent on it to make any real difference
But he is optimistic about the county's future. 'Britainhasn't got a good
reputation for value for money in the tourism field,' he says, 'but I think
Devon's hotels, particularly, do offer very good rates.
A Devon success story? 30 years ago Percy Brend, a butcher who supplied meat
to the local luxury hotel at Staunton Sands, dreamed of buying it. He did
buy it - and now his three sons run it, together with nine other hotels in
the West Country. Percy's widow, Florence, now in her 80s, still has a hand
in the hotels' interior decoration.
This year the family bought another three star hotel in Barnstaple, and has
built a luxury out-door pool at Staunton Sands overlooking the resort's
three mile long sandy beach.

examines the core of the county's defence economy

JUST LOOK at the pubs of Plymouth: the Navy, the Maritime Inn, the General
Moore, the Lord High Admiral, the Admiral McBride, the United Services Inn.
The place is riddled with military tradition. At the city council,
Labour-led these days, the committee rooms bear names like Ark Royal and
Temeraire.
This is one of the areas of Britain most dependent on the armed forces and
activities supporting them. But it is now fighting against the threat of
losing much of its military role - decisions that could make its
300-year-old dockyard unviable and severely reduce its naval presence.
The refit yard, owned by the government but run by a private-sector
consortium, Devonport Management Ltd (DML), sprawls over 300 acres, across
the river from Cornwall. The site, with its three miles of deep-water
berths, is dotted with historic buildings, some refurbished, some standing
empty. With the naval base - the two are located virtually on top of each
other - it is the biggest complex of its kind in Europe.
This is the core of Devon's defence economy. The Plymouth area accounts for
some 23,000 Ministry of Defence salaries, This figure includes 5,000
dockyard employees, 3,500 civilians and 1,500 navy personnel at the base,
some 3,000 Royal Marines, a commando regiment of Royal Artillery and about
7,000 sailors serving on Plymouth-based ships. Plymouth is the home port
for, among other vessels, most of the navy's frigates and its largest
squadron of nuclear-powered submarines.
Various other defence facilities are scattered around Devon, including the
Royal Naval College at Dartmouth, the RAF's Hawk training squadron at
Chivenor in the north, and the Exeter headquarters of the locally-recruited
Devon and Dorset Regiment, known to some as the Armoured Farmers.
So far these have not been bitten by cutbacks under the government's Options
for Change defence review, but others have. RAF Mount Batten, a one-time
flying-boat base on a promontory on the edge of Plymouth Sound, is scheduled
to shut down by the end of the year, with its combat survival school moving
to St Mawgan in Cornwall. Closure of naval weapons facilities at Ernesettle,
just up the River Tamar from the Devonport dockyard, will affect about half
the 760 employees there.
The dockyard itself employs less than a quarter of the workforce it had at
the end of the second world war. In 1985 it still employed more than 13,000.
Since then, 8,000 jobs have gone. After it was transferred to private
sector-management in 1987, its workload fell faster than anticipated. Worse
than that: reductions announced in 1990 in the navy's submarine fleet
threatened its very livelihood. DML concluded there would no longer be a
need for two UK facilities for refitting and refuelling nuclear-powered
submarines, the backbone of the business both at Devonport and at Rosyth in
Scotland. Rosyth, responsible for the work on all Britain's Polaris
nuclear-missile submarines and about half the remaining nuclear-powered
fleet, already had a project in hand for docks big enough to take the new
Trident boats.
The 'great nuclear race' was launched in May 1991, when DML sent an
unsolicited proposal to the MoD and the Treasury. Its plan is a Pounds 200m
development over 10 years, aimed at undercutting the cost to the government
of going ahead with Rosyth. The plan uses mostly existing facilities. In
addition to the two docks of Devonport's present submarine complex, DML
plans to adapt for the purpose three huge dry docks which were designed
before the first world war to accommodate battleships.
A government decision on where to concentrate nuclear submarine work is
expected by the end of the year, to be followed by moves towards further
privatisation. In August the MoD invited companies to register interest in
purchasing one or both dockyards.
DML has succeeded in diversifying into a range of activities, from
all-terrain vehicles to fire-protection panels. The 10 identical ocean-going
yachts taking part in the British Steel round-the-world race are
Devonport-built.
The amount of work won by competition - as distinct from being allocated by
the MoD - has risen to 22 per cent. A navy frigate in a covered dock stands
side by side with the Sultan of Oman's royal yacht.
But there is no escaping the overriding importance of the nuclear business.
A submarine like Trafalgar - the first of the navy's most recent class of
'hunter-killer' boats, now in dry-dock at Devonport - represents up to
Pounds 150m worth of work over 2 1/2 years.
DML executives have studied the alternatives if the decision goes against
Devonport, but have come up with a bleak picture. Mr Mike Leece, DML's
managing director, says it might be possible to keep two naval dockyards.
'But one would be much reduced in size from now,' he says. Devonport needs
the submarine activity to optimise its facilities and remain competitive. It
has, says DML, less chance than the smaller Rosyth facility of surviving on
surface-ship work alone.
A recent study by Dr Paul Bishop of Plymouth University (the former
Polytechnic South West) estimated that closing the dockyard and running down
the base could cost 22,600 jobs, including many of the region's higher-paid
industrial posts. The complex, he found, generated Pounds 52Im a year into
the local economy of Devon and Cornwall, some 5 per cent of total income and
30 per cent of the Plymouth area's. Almost 30,000 jobs were supported by it,
directly or indirectly, with 600 local companies receiving orders from the
dockyard.
It is little wonder, then, that Plymouth City Council, even with a Labour
majority, should have cast aside any qualms about nuclear activities and
thrown its weight firmly behind DML's case. Mr John Ingham, council leader,
says the area's skill-base has already been badly affected by job losses at
Devonport.
'We've had no favours from the MoD at all,' he complains.
He cannot envisage 'the worst doomsday scenario' - complete closure not only
of the dockyard but also the base. 'We wouldn't be able to stand the scale
of that without some profound government help . . .The support we would need
from central government would be quite astronomical.'
