FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Independent Bank cannot be regulator as well as
guardian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRYAN CASSIDY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, An autonomous Bank of England should be one of the necessary
preconditions for sterling's re-entry into the ERM, as your leader ('Down
and down again', October 6) rightly states. But, before that, don't we have
to review the Bank's regulatory role? The doubt cast over it by the US
Congress's report on BCCI and the backwash from the Blue Arrow affair which
sent waves lapping to its very doors are strong arguments for separating the
Bank's role as guardian of the currency from that of regulator. The UK needs
a strong banking regulator without umbilical links to the banking industry.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Letter: Major and cabinet have gained 'substantial
successes' in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr IAN TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I should like to remind some of your contributors about the substantial
success which Mr Major and his cabinet are achieving with their leadership
from the 'heart' of the European Community.
Who, at Maastricht, fought for and won concessions to enshrine subsidiarity
and to reserve a position as to whether Britain should join a single
currency bloc? With the hindsight enjoyed by most of his critics, perhaps Mr
Major should have foreseen that his position in the ERM was precarious.
However, he did try to play the game with a 'straight bat' within the rules
as they were understood to be at the time.
It seems quite possible and even desirable that the 'greater German' bloc
should emerge. I very much doubt if the French will relish the thought of
their economic management being dictated by an 'independent' central bank
and thus will most likely opt to wait until Britain, France and Italy have
converged sufficiently with Germany to allow a joint politically controlled
central bank by the participating countries.
Again Mr Major's instinct for caution in rejoining the ERM follows
logically. Some commentators like to portray this as a sop to the so-called
Euro-sceptics. If this is so then truly we would all be Euro-sceptics, which
we are not. His insistence that a return to the ERM will not be in the
foreseeable future seems only common sense.
The Conservative party is, of course, representative of the feelings in
Britain as a whole. The Conservative government has achieved its Maastricht
goals with the consent of parliament and I am sure that the Conservative
party conference will give Mr Major a strong vote of confidence.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Economic Viewpoint: What I would do as chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the long run we are all dead - Lord Keynes (circa 1921).
Keynes is dead and we are living in the long run - Participant at a Keynes
conference, 1991.
Saying what one would do, if one were chancellor, is a form of journalism
best indulged in one's 20s. We are where we are through a complex historical
process; and there are no hitherto unused monetary indicators waiting to be
pulled out of a hat, the mere announcement of which will restore
credibility. Some so-called market commentators are looking in a dark room
for a black cat which is not there.
Moreover, the whole 10-point programme attitude of mind is misguided. For it
assumes that there are a few technocratic gimmicks by which a few clever
people at the centre could point a painless way to growth without inflation.
It is this rather than any specific doctrine, which is the malign aspect of
Keynes's legacy.
What I object to most in the programmatic approach is the absurdly
over-inflated role it gives to government. The political philosopher Michael
Oakeshott made a distinction between the state as an enterprise association,
with specific aims and purposes, and the state as a civil association, which
provides a framework of law and institutions in which individuals,
companies, voluntary bodies and many other groups pursue their own purposes.
Not only is a civil association a much more congenial idea; it is also less
unsuccessful. The enterprise association reached its highest form of
development in the Soviet five-year plans. These collapsed, together with
more moderate Swedish type ideas for reforming society from the centre.
No government has the knowledge - much of it unquantifiable - which would be
required for such ambitions. Yet political discourse is still in the
language of the enterprise association. Even radical-right Conservative
governments believe they have to do something called 'promoting growth'.
Having said all this, I will swallow my words with a 10-point non-plan. This
is partly because I have been asked to do so and partly because this is a
journalistic way of encapsulating a few thoughts, acceptable if very
sparingly used. The intention is to improve the framework of rules and
institutions of civil society rather than to ask for implausibly heroic
political leadership.
The reason why the British found it so difficult to live with the exchange
rate mechanism has nothing to do with the alleged misdeeds of the Bundesbank
or even the entry parity. Nor has it much to do with the personal qualities
of the chancellor. The British are just very addicted to the inflationary
habit, which they find so difficult to kick.
Politicians and commentators have evinced a curious born-again belief in
fiscal activism. They want, mostly unspecified, public expenditure cuts. But
of course these must not affect infrastructure, investment, or any other
area where they are actually likely to be made.
It just happens that on the evidence of the past two decades, monetary and
exchange rate policies are far more potent weapons against inflation than
fiscal policy. There are many reasons for wanting to balance the budget once
economic activity is on a sustainable trend level. But with free capital
markets there is an extremely loose link between the budget deficit and
either inflation or interest rates. The main reason why politicians are
turning to fiscal policy is that for the moment tight money seems to be
politically more unpopular. In addition - as we see from the memoirs of the
Callaghan period - ministers find it much easier to dispute with each other
on spending programmes than on monetary or exchange rate policy, which is
left to a tiny inner group.
Having got all this off my chest, here is my 10-point non-programme:
1. There should be a standing commission on laws and business practices
which make it difficult to reduce inflation, or increase the costs of so
doing. My own most important articles have not been my running commentaries
on macroeconomic policy, but the occasional pieces I have written on
practices such as upwards-only rent reviews of business rents or the
insidious effect of treating house purchase as a foolproof investment for
gain rather than a way of providing shelter. The commission should avoid an
indiscriminate onslaught on indexation, but probe notions such as the annual
wage round, the rate for the job and nationwide bargaining.
2. There should be a thorough investigation of the events leading up to the
humiliation of Black Wednesday, when the UK ignominiously left the ERM. This
should go well beyond the ritual calls for the resignation of the chancellor
and look at the whole machinery of Treasury and Bank of England advice which
has guided successive chancellors, and which would deprive key officials of
the excuse that they cannot answer back.
3. There is no point in just calling for an independent Bank of England, if
this means just giving slightly more power to the existing Bank. Indeed no
central bank has covered itself in glory in recent weeks. What is required
is a new Bank of England Act which would give the Bank specific objectives,
for which it could be held accountable, and which would not prevent it being
ultimately merged with the European Central Bank envisaged in the Maastricht
treaty. Once the new institution is established under a new act it would be
given sufficient independence to put monetary policy at one or two removes
from the political expediency of those concerned with managing party
conferences.
4. The government should declare its aim of rejoining some version of the
exchange rate mechanism when the time is ripe. This is deliberately harking
back to the Thatcher formula, with the big difference that the aim would be
to rejoin rather than find excuses for not so doing. Moreover the discussion
should be open and above board without the 'I must prevail' attitude of the
former premier.
Those official advisers - not all that thick on the ground - who seriously
favour returning, suggest two conditions. The first is that German interest
rates should be seen to be moving clearly downwards; in fact German money
market rates have already fallen by nearly one percentage point, much more
than the official Lombard rate. The second is that the UK should be clearly
emerging from recession. I am more worried about this second condition, the
fulfilment of which will remain a matter of opinion. I would rather just say
that the UK should rejoin the ERM when German interest rates are over the
unification hump. And preferably within two years.
5. In the meanwhile there should be a broad band exchange rate objective.
The difficulties of German reunification make the D-Mark target on its own
temporarily difficult. On the other hand the weakness of the dollar distorts
the sterling index too. So I would temporarily settle for some kind of
average between the two.
The chart illustrates how close the relationship is between the internal and
external value of the pound. But it is a medium to long-term one. For
instance, inflation could slow down in the 1980s, even though the pound was
falling because there had been an earlier sterling overshoot. But as the
slide went on, it was inevitable that sooner or later it would find its way
into domestic inflationary pressure.
It is the insidious depreciation of sterling, year after year, which feeds
into inflation rather than the short periods of intense pressure which hit
the headlines. It is much more important that sterling should remain in the
same broad band (or higher) over the next few years than exactly how low it
falls in the next few weeks.
6. There should be an objective for total domestic spending, measured
approximately by my old friend, nominal gross domestic product. The target
path I have suggested is based on projections by the investment bank Goldman
Sachs made when the UK was still in the ERM. The idea is to ensure
sufficient demand to maintain economic growth, but only if inflation
continues to come down.
It is this direction which matters rather than highly fallible targets for
intermediate measures of money, credit and the like. The key relationships
are so unreliable and change so frequently that they should be changeable at
the discretion of the Bank of England, or whomever is operating monetary
policy. It would be a crass mistake to centre policy around intermediate
objectives which will carry little conviction.
7. Under normal circumstances that would be that. But in view of the
breakdown of confidence a separate target path is needed for inflation
itself, in terms not of the ridiculous Retail Prices Index but some
underlying measure of inflation of which the GDP deflator is an example. If
you have a target path for nominal GDP and for inflation, you implicitly
have a projection for real growth as well. But the latter is residual and
cannot easily be influenced by government.
8. Interest rate policy would be governed by points 4 to 7. Meanwhile, I can
see no point in massive public spending cuts or tax increases in a
recession, whatever the mythology of 1981. Public spending should be curbed
sufficiently to secure a balanced budget in the longer term.
9. Much more important is the breakdown of public spending - not between
production and consumption, which is a statistical artefact - but between
purchases of goods and services, inflationary pay increases and cash
transfers. A freeze of all public sector wages would repeat the cardinal sin
of all previous incomes policies in ignoring supply and demand in particular
labour markets. On the other hand a simple freeze in the public sector wage
bill, would make it all too easy to carry on with a conventional wage round
at the cost of dismissing public sector workers. The freeze must operate at
the level of average pay per head.
10. To achieve the maximum realism with a minimum of hardship, social
security needs to move humanely, but uncompromisingly towards selectivity.
To be blunt, future increases in pensions and child benefits should go to
those who need them rather than wastefully distributed all round.
What would happen if there were conflicts between the nominal GDP, exchange
rate and inflation objectives? We would be doing extremely well if any of
them were taken seriously enough for conflicts to arise. In any case I would
not last long as chancellor in any conceivable British cabinet to have to
resolve them.

JAPAN'S GLOBAL REACH: The Influences, Strategies and Weaknesses of Japan's
Multinational Companies
By Bill Emmott
Century, Pounds 18.99, 244 pages
At Nissan's UK plant, carpet pieces are ordered, made, delivered and fitted
to Micra cars within just 42 minutes. The average time a European-made part
spends in stock is 1.6 days, compared with the industry average of 20 days.
These and countless other facts about the Sunderland plant are surprising,
like the lists of things the Japanese own - Firestone, the Exxon Building,
Bush House, Aquascutum, Columbia Pictures . . . Gosh, how do those Japanese
companies do it? There must be something special about them.
Well, no. At least not according to Bill Emmott, business affairs editor of
The Economist. His book is about the remarkable expansion of Japan's
companies into multinationals during the 1980s. His thesis is that the
Japanese are simply taking advantage of economic and business phenomena
which have been seen before, such as in the expansion of American companies
into Europe. Japanese companies have no magic formula. They do not take a
uniform approach and make plenty of mistakes.
A former Tokyo correspondent and author of a previous book about Japan
entitled The Sun Also Sets, Emmott is an authority on the subject. He is
good at shattering myths and deflating prejudices. He tells us that Japanese
factories abroad use a wide range of suppliers and most of them are not
Japanese-owned; that most Japanese expatriates do not send their children to
Japanese schools; that Japanese methods can be emulated by non-Japanese
companies.
Japan has been doing a good job of demystifying itself lately, with its
collapsing stock market and stuttering economy. But Emmott's points are all
still useful in view of the passions stirred up by Japanese presence
overseas. Emmott correctly attributes much criticism, especially on the
issue of domestic content of US-made cars, to prejudice which is not
directed at foreign investors of other nationalities. He argues that the
overseas operations of Japanese companies are more truly Japanese if they do
not import parts. Their 'lean production' methods demand a reliable network
of suppliers close at hand. Only in this way can they bring productivity
towards Japanese levels. If parts are made domestically, it is irrelevant
whether the suppliers are Japanese-owned.
Emmott is also no doubt correct in saying that 'Japanese 'superiority' is
mighty similar to the sorts of superiority identified among American
multinationals in the past'. Like American companies investing abroad in the
1950s, Japanese companies, on average, appear to have the best operating
methods. But this does not take us very far. This is where this book falls
down. It tells us what is not happening, and not new. It is not as
illuminating about what is.
The book's structure does not help Emmott to develop a picture of Japan's
global reach. Four 'case-studies' of Japanese expansion are interspersed in
no obvious logical manner with general chapters which analyse the results of
an extensive survey, conducted by the author, of Japanese companies with
operations in the US, Britain and the continent. Then, Emmott departs from
the book's subject and devotes the final chapters to a rambling look at the
future of Japan and even the world, without closely relating his
prognostications to Japan's multinationals.
The full survey, including questions on employment, productivity, local
content, management methods and expatriate life, is published in appendices.
The results are generally useful if unsurprising. But some respondents'
comments provide tantalising glimpses, such as that of an American employee
of a software company who says: 'Their business practices are reminiscent of
the 17th-century shogunate.'
Other controversial Japanese management techniques are not fully addressed.
Something unusual is happening when a former Sony employee in Wales writes a
letter to the FT on 'shadowing' - the practice of having a Japanese employee
looking over the shoulder of local staff - and says: 'If the Japanese are
happy to lead a way of life that to us is insane, then good luck to them.'
Yet this practice is dismissed by Emmott with 'there is nothing unusual
about Sony's shadowing policy . . . nor is there anything especially
sinister about it'. Perhaps, but an examination of Japan's global reach
needs deeper discussion of companies' practices. Why do companies have
'shadows', and what do they do? Given his attention to particular examples,
Emmott should explore such questions in detail.
Though the book contains much interesting material, the case-studies - of
car makers, Bridgestone's purchase of Firestone, the forays into Hollywood,
and London's financial markets - do not get under the skin of Japan's
adventurers abroad. This is perhaps because the author has already decided
that there is nothing much new about the phenomenon of Japanese investment
overseas - and because of his declared intent to remain 'agnostic'.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Leading Article: An unelected president
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE PARAGRAPH in Mr Chris Patten's speech yesterday to the Hong Kong
Legislative Council (LegCo) was clearly directed at editorial writers in the
UK. The pace of democratisation in Hong Kong, he said, was constrained by
international agreements and 'the implacable realities of history, geography
and economics'; and this fact was better understood within the territory
than by 'those who would like the people of Hong Kong to be the heroic pawns
of their own doubtless well-meaning preconceptions'.
What this means is that, since Britain is committed to returning Hong Kong
to China in 1997, there is no point in setting up a model democracy there
between now and then, only to see it dismantled, with much acrimony and
perhaps even bloodshed, thereafter. Everything that is done in these last
five years has to be done with an eye to its likely consequences in the
years beyond.
So much is common sense. But on that observation can be founded two
radically different policies. One, favoured by Mr Martin Lee's United
Democrats (UDHK) who won most of the directly elected seats in last year's
LegCo elections, is to introduce as much democracy as possible, in the hope
that China will shrink from the odium of dismantling it when it comes to the
point. The other, favoured until now by the British government, is to try
and persuade China that more democracy would be a good idea, but refrain
from implementing any changes China does not approve.
Middle way
In yesterday's speech Mr Patten attempted to chart a middle way between
those two approaches. On relations between LegCo and the Executive Council
(ExCo) he announced measures to be adopted now, without reference to China.
But on the method of electing the next LegCo in 1995 he made 'proposals',
which 'will require serious discussion with Peking'. Judging by the prompt
and unfavourable reaction of the New China News Agency, the discussion will
certainly be difficult. Whether it will be serious on the Chinese side
remains to be seen.
Mr Patten knows well that the Chinese will reject, once again, Britain's
proposal to increase the number of directly elected seats beyond the 20 (out
of 60) so far agreed.
But he has devised an alternative which seeks to reach a similar result by a
more convoluted route, respecting the letter of Beijing's Basic Law. This is
to broaden the franchise for the 'functional' constituencies so that they
embrace the entire working population, and to ensure that the 'election
committee' (which under the Basic Law will elect 10 LegCo members) is itself
composed of elected people.
Future tense
But what does he do if China rejects this package? Taken at face value, his
speech offers no fallback position. Yet the proposals for the new
constituencies are spelt out in considerable detail in an 'illustrative
pamphlet', with copious use of the future tense. And at his press conference
Mr Patten let fall the remark that 'if China wants to change it back, then
it won't lose anything in its own terms'. That suggests he is ready to
override a Chinese veto if necessary. If so, his approach is much nearer to
that of Mr Lee than appears at first sight.
Meanwhile, he has angered Mr Lee's supporters by refusing them seats on
ExCo, which they hoped to turn into a quasi-cabinet drawn from LegCo and
reflecting last year's election results. Mr Patten rejected this, insisting
on the separation of powers. He himself is handing over the chairmanship of
LegCo to an elected president, and promises in future to be 'answerable to'
LegCo as head of the executive. He is even instituting a kind of 'governor's
question time'. The role he defines for himself is thus half way between
that of a British prime minister and a US president. Yet he is neither
elected by the people nor removable by any representative body.
That will also be true of his Chinese-appointed successor in 1997. Evidently
he believes there is no chance China would accept an elected executive, but
some chance it can be persuaded to work with a democratic legislature if he,
and the Hong Kong politicians, can get such a system up and running over the
next five years. It is a long shot, but a bold and imaginative one, which
deserves to succeed.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Realism and the Eurofighter
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPLETE breakdown of collaborative arrangements for the European Fighter
Aircraft is now a distinct possibility. That would present the British
government with a formidable dilemma. It would be loath to abandon the
project at this stage and buy another fighter. But it also would - or should
 -think twice before committing the UK to undertaking EFA production on its
own.
The German government is clearly set on having no part in the aircraft the
UK wants, and the other partners - Italy and Spain - are at best hesitant.
In an atmosphere of political and monetary disarray in Europe, there is a
temptation for Britain to say boo to the rest and press ahead on its own.
The Ministry of Defence has begun testing the waters to see if a solo
programme is politically acceptable. For UK manufacturers it may look like
the best solution of all.
Britain could build it. It could save the extra costs involved in spreading
production work among partners in different countries. It could appoint a
prime contractor and lessen the risk to the taxpayer. But a UK-only aircraft
would still, almost certainly, turn out more expensive because of the
shorter production run. The RAF's requirement is 250 aircraft, less than a
third of the original EFA programme. Whether the project was worthwhile
would depend - as with the Challenger 2 tank which the UK ordered from
Vickers last year - on winning export orders from the third world.
Inadequate alternatives
The less competitive EFA's price becomes, the less objection there will be
to an off-the-shelf alternative such as the US F-15. Britain has, after all,
bought American fighters before. But the only realistic cheaper alternatives
to EFA are all aircraft of 1970s design. The F-15 has a successor, the F-22,
but it is well outside the UK's targets for size, weight and cost. EFA's
closest European rival, the French Rafale, was designed for different
requirements and costs just as much.
Britain insists on an aircraft capable of defeating any likely opposition,
including - and here its perceptions stand in sharp contrast to Germany's -
in overseas military operations. But it has more than military reasons for
wanting to hang on to EFA. The UK has more to lose in terms of strategic
industrial capability than the other three partners. The widely-touted
estimate of 40,000 UK jobs depending on the programme may not be overstated.
BAe faces void
The collapse of EFA would be the heaviest blow to the industry since the TSR
2 strike aircraft was cancelled by the Labour government in 1965. That
project was eventually replaced by the tri-national Tornado, but no such
satisfactory outcome can be expected to follow EFA's cancellation. The
alternative collaboration partners, the French and the Americans, both have
their own agendas for the time being. A future Anglo-French fighter is
mooted, but would not materialise until well into the next century. Before
then British Aerospace (as if it did not have enough troubles already) would
be facing a void at the core of its profit-making military activities.
The UK authorities and the industrial partners must take part of the blame
for the project's current state. Britain helped to alienate German opinion
by pushing its way into leadership of all the programme's main elements. The
Eurofighter consortium of airframe manufacturers also made a clear tactical
blunder in April by pitching its price for the production phase too high. Mr
Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, has since staked his considerable
political ambitions on his decision to reject the aircraft.
However, Britain still has a strong bargaining position. EFA may look
precarious without Germany, but without Britain, Germany's counter-proposal
of a new collaborative fighter - dubbed the EFA Lite - looks a non-starter.
The UK's best interest is to try its utmost to rescue EFA collaboration at
least with Spain and Italy, even if that means making some compromises in
the aircraft's performance. If collaboration was judged to be imperative in
the mid-1980s - when the cold war persisted and defence spending was at its
peak - it is hard to see how going it alone can make sense now.

How 'green' are the oil giants? That is the question investigated in Channel
4's Critical Eye: The Heat of the Moment (9.00). Oil discoveries have never
done a lot of good for the environment. Filmed secretly in Ecuador,
Nigerian, Gabon and Papua and New Guinea, the film suggests that despite the
much flaunted green credentials of oil companies, drilling means health
risks for the locals and irreparable damage to disappearing habitats.
If you are looking for something which will weigh less heavy on the soul,
tonight is strong on comedy although of the four on offer only the geriatric
jollities on BBC 1's Waiting For God (8.30) is actually new.
Choucroute has always seemed to me as one of the more horrible dishes of
French cuisine - although it can always be blamed on the Germans. However,
there are many more palatable aspects of Alsatian cooking as Mireille
Johnston amply demonstrates in A Cook's Tour of France: Alsace on BBC 2
(8.00). Ghouls have a feast with Crimewatch File: Murder Without Motive on
BBC1 at 9.30, re-enacting an appalling murder solved with the help of
psychologists and handwriting experts.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Arts: A lively look at death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Post Mortem is a short, angry, anti-war play by Noel Coward, unstaged since
he wrote it on a steamer in 1930. Now The King's Head Theatre, Islington,
has brought the play to life in a lucid, engaging production.
It is 1917. John Cavan dies in action in France. But his perturbed spirit
stretches the moment of death into 13 mortal years. He returns to see family
and friends in 1930 to look at the war from then. His idealism at death
meets their compromises during the post-war years. Only one fellow officer,
Perry Lomas, remembers the war: he has written an anti-war book called 'Post
Mortem'.
The play amounts to a series of encounters: there is unfinished business
with Cavan's mother and fiancee; and an awkward reunion with his army
friends. The sternest test of Cavan's beliefs comes in his exchange with
Lomas, a dispirited agnostic inveighing against an English conspiracy to
cover over the war. When Cavan appears, Lomas is about to kill himself:
'Don't put me off, there's a good chap, it's all I've got to look forward
to.' All of Coward is in this scene: his despair of English class, his
horror at English following of rules, and his Swiftian love of people as
individually pleasant but collectively idiotic.
The plot lies between Tennyson's In Memoriam and Truly, Madly, Deeply. The
former asks 'Do we indeed desire the dead should still be with us at our
side?', the other plunges into afterlife drama. Here, Coward manages to
imbue the creepiness of Cavan's visitation with the social swing of a visit.
The wit erupts occasionally: 'Are they in love?' asks Cavan. 'I don't know -
they go to the opera together,' his mother replies.
Richard Stirling's direction and Mark Friend's design for this small theatre
both work well. Steven Pacey acts Lomas superbly, a model of unquiet
resolve; Harry Burton as Cavan keeps pace with the demands of the part, but
looks unmoved and unmoving. Opposite him, his father, Sir James 'Jumbo'
Cavan (Roy Sampson), proprietor of The Mercury is a horror of hypocrisy.
The tricks of time resemble TS Eliot's work in the 1920s. There are spots of
thoughtful lyricism: 'Youth is a long way away, it doesn't matter any more .
. . Life's a joke with no one to laugh at it.' Really, life's a slow way of
dying.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Arts: Ibsen at its best - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This A Doll's House is an exemplary Ibsen production. The Wild Iris Theatre
Company could not have introduced themselves better when they staged it last
year at the tiny DOC, in Kentish Town - before taking it to the Ibsen
Festival in Norway. Now, the larger Bridge Lane Theatre will let many more
theatre-lovers savour it.
It is the best Ibsen I've seen since the Young Vic's Enemy of the People:
far above the latter's current Rosmersholm (over-slick, though
well-intentioned), better than the National's uneven Peer Gynt or their
recent Hedda (strong but flashy). This Doll's House is played quite
straight, in fine, humane detail and faultlessly paced.
The result is that we can't patronise the play as 'period-bound', just an
Ur-feminist exhibit; on the contrary, we are seized by the story and the
characters, amused, moved and even enlightened.
All praise to the director Polly Irvin: her directorial hand never obtrudes,
but the quality of the ensemble-acting must owe a sizeable debt to her
unwinkingly thoughtful care. The designs by Gabrielle Sabran and Colin Hill
are no less apt and self-effacing, and thanks to the choreographer Sue
Glasser the heroine Nora's Christmas-party tarantella - potentially an
embarrassment - boasts a free spirit's flair.
Famously, Nora is the first theatrical Wife who Walks Out. Clever Sophie
Thursfield makes her disarmingly transparent, provincial and slightly ditzy,
where modern fashion expects cruelly downtrodden nobility of soul.
That gives her smug husband Torvald (Timothy Bentinck) a decent excuse,
however insufficient, for treating her as a dim pet.
Which is dramatically all to the good; and it also means that when the time
comes for the worm to turn, she can execute the turn-around with scathing
simplicity. Their final face-off represents both sides fairly, and is
genuinely wrenching.
Though Miss Thursfield is admirable, Nora is a treat of a role. Bentinck
achieves a greater miracle with his Torvald: neither crudely domineering nor
a sentimental twit (the usual readings), but a subtle, vividly detailed
study of a young-middle-aged Victorian husband whose paternalism is a matter
of unreflective inheritance. We can't but feel for him too, when Bentinck
reveals him in such sympathetic depth.
On a shorter lead (with only two really dense scenes to explore), Thane
Bettany matches him as the doomed medic Dr Rank, dry-eyed, eloquently gentle
and uncomplaining.
Those three performances are already decisive reasons for seeing the Iris
Doll's House. Christopher McHallem's Krogstad, the unhappy 'villain' of the
piece, and Julia Lloyd Barrie's destitute, widowed Christine - his lost
sweetheart, Nora's stiff-upper-lipped old friend - supply two more.
If each of them is a degree nearer caricature than need be (a bit of surplus
cringing from McHallem, an excess of spinsterly grit from Barrie), they
contrive nonetheless to reunite with tremulous spontaneity.
That is beautifully calibrated, well beyond the schematic lines that Ibsen
gave them; it makes more of the under-written subplot than ever seemed
likely. But don't take my word for it: just go] It may be several years
before Ibsen is so well played again in London.
A Doll's House, Bridge Lane Theatre, Battersea, SW11, until 24 October

Beauty And The Beast is Disney going Euro in the right way. The company's
theme park invasion of France may have misfired, but this commando raid on
French folklore has been its biggest animation success since Snow White And
The Seven Dwarfs. Dollars 133m at the American box office; rave reviews; and
learned articles in Sight And Sound about the sexual politics of fairy
tales.
SP creeps into everything today, so no wonder this movie's heroine, the
lovely Belle, has a village suitor who is unmistakably a male chauvinist
pig. You can tell from his beefcake narcissism and taste in macho decor. 'I
use antlers in all my de-cor-A-TING]' he sings in his big number. So Belle
decides to give him up, and to give herself up to the castle-dwelling Beast
in exchange for her inventor father, held prisoner after straying innocently
into his lair.
Once confined, the girl finds the B and his castle ever more appealing and
so do we. There is the all-talking, all-singing double act of the Maurice
Chevalier-accented candlestick and clock with dial-moustaches, supported in
tutti numbers by the cockney teapot and yapping canine foot-cushion. Then
there are the monster statues lining the stairs, folk myth's equivalent of
the family portrait. Then there is the B himself, a broody thunderous hulk
swagged to the eyeballs in face-concealing cloak - until (violin music
please) his guard drops and love begins to twitter on the horizon.
It could have been the worst Disney syrup. Instead it is the best Disney
blend of comedy and romance. We know we are in animation Heaven from the
beginning, with the shifting-perspective vistas of forest and castle and the
mock-Mediaeval stained-glass tableaux. The songs by Alan Menken and Howard
Ashman (of The Little Mermaid) break into this Arcady with wit and ease. And
once inside the castle, the choreography of characters and camera has a
dazzling virtuosity.
Years ago I and other critics prophesied the death of paint-and-brush
animation, condemned (we thought) by the modernist arsenal of animatronics,
muppetry and video trickery. But the new styles have been outwitted by the
old. Beauty And The Beast has a lived-in lyricism and a pictorial
sumptuousness that none of the newer techniques could have equalled.

Could someone out there help me with the spate of slang in modern American
cinema? 'The mustard's off the hot dog, you corn-fed mule, you]' barks black
basketballer Wesley Snipes to white friend Woody Harrelson in White Men
Can't Jump. What does he mean? And what about the last line of the movie:
'You can put a cat in the oven, but that don't make it a biscuit.' Why are
these people putting cats in ovens? And what is the proverbial symbolism of
hot dogs and mules?
That we still enjoy Ron Shelton's comedy about confidence-tricking
sportsmen, scamming their way from one street game to the next, pays tribute
to its lickety-split charm. This is The Hustler for basketballers. Snipes is
the dancing, bouncing human spider who 'sets up' the victims; Harrelson is
the seeming chump pulled off the street as his partner, in game after game,
to fool initially derisive opponents.
Trouble starts when our two heroes set out to fool each other, and when
their womenfolk take dim views of their down-market lifestyles. Harrelson's
girlfriend (Rosie Perez) is a Latino hoyden with a dentist's drill voice,
yearning for glory on TV gameshows. Snipes' wife (Tyra Ferrell) is a social
climber whose spouse keeps dragging her back to base camp.
Shelton wrote and directed Bull Durham, which did for baseball what this
does for basketball: treated it as a trial of machismo for overgrown kids,
in which men fool about with notions of virility while women attend to the
real business of life. Ms Perez puts the ball-playing ethos in context.
'Winning and losing is all one big organic globule from which you take what
you want,' she ear-splittingly muses, shortly before her own
winner-takes-all triumph on a TV quiz show.
Ah, but who says characters must be consistent. Shelton's skill as a
film-maker is to capture life messy and on the move. Edited with a feral
grace by Paul Seydor, White Men Can't Jump never pauses even to ponder its
wry message of racial togetherness. (Whites and blacks can be chums,
especially when given a common enemy to fool.) Instead the film is as fast,
buoyant and full of feinting rubato as basketball itself.
* * *
Two Shakespeare plays turn up in strange guise this week. Orson Welles'
Othello has been restored and revived 40 years after its first release. A
masterpiece for some, 'Citizen Coon' for others, it stars a black-faced
Welles in the lead role, stomping with cast and crew from one ill-funded
location to another. The film took three years to make and shuttled between
Rome, Venice and Morocco. Whenever the director-star needed more money he
dashed off to an acting assignment (The Third Man, The Black Rose) while his
own players sat around in the sun, twiddling their Arden editions.
The result? Count me in the masterpiece camp. And camp masterpiece is the
phrase juste for this soaring essay in movie baroque. We begin with
Eisensteinian crowd geometries in a lavish funeral procession; we take a
pinch of German Expressionism for Iago's hate-twisted tirades in twisty
streets; we invoke Sternberg's l'erotisme voile for bedroom scenes; and we
plunder Citizen Kane itself for the crazed low angles craning from floor to
ceilings.
Here Welles has one of his great inspirations. In two scenes a large oval
trap is opened in the roof, silhouetting the nobles against a scudding
Tiepolo sky as they gaze down on the Moor's gathering madness.
But then inspirations stumble over each other here like geese at feeding
time. Rodrigo's murder is staged as a black farce in a bath-house (Welles
had run out of costume money); the grief-stricken Desdemona (Suzanne
Cloutier) walks away over a tiled floor patterned like teardrops; the
captive Iago (superb Micheal Mac Liammoir) is hoisted in a cage up a
terrifying castle wall; and everywhere the plastic lighting patterns light
up the text, from the eerily lucent skyscapes to the shadows wild as Jackson
Pollock paintings for Othello's spasms of jealousy.
As You Like It is a tamer affair, even though director Christine Edzard (of
Little Dorrit) has dared to set Shakespeare's pastoral comedy in a
modern-day London. Fleeing the City's temples of finance, where their elders
are brokers and bankers, Rosalind and Orlando (Emma Croft, Andrew Tiernan)
meet and woo in a Thameside wasteground. Jacques is James Fox in a
jumble-sale coat. Touchstone is Griff Rhys Jones with a rictus grin. And
Orlando's love messages carved on trees become hip-hop graffiti sprayed on
the river wall.
It starts to work half an hour from the close. Here fog wreathes the
characters in gentle fantasy and the words begin to charm. Before that we
feel like victims of a mobile theatre experiment, moving our camp stools
from one daft venue to the next as we follow a bunch of under-rehearsed
actors belting it out into the void.
But the rubbish of the week prize goes to Blue Ice. In this thrill-free spy
thriller directed by Russell Mulcahy (Highlander) Michael Caine plays a
retired MI5 agent now running a London jazz club. He doesn't know much about
music but he knows what he dislikes ('Schoenberg always struck me as being a
bit of a wanker'). So he falls for the cooing cadences of US Ambassador's
wife Sean Young, who gets him knee-deep in an international arms plot.
Struggling to stay alert through the two hours' traffic jam of contrivances,
we are honked awake by sudden outbursts of bloodletting, bad acting and Bob
Hoskins (in a short but meaningless cameo). Mr C himself contributes some
sleepy-lidded charm and cockney rhyming slang. But all told, I'd rather fall
down the apples and pears and break both daisy farms than sit through it all
again.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Any London concert involving Frans Bruggen is an event, whether he brings
his own Orchestra of the 18th Century or conducts the Orchestra of the Age
of the Enlightenment. On Tuesday he opened the OAE's new season with an
all-Bach programme of marvellous rich invention and elegance. If there were
any agnostics who still required evidence that period-instrument playing
need impose no interpretative shackles these flexible, warmly expressive
performances must have furnished it.
The substance of the evening was two of the orchestral Suites, the First and
Fourth. Neither was conceived in grand, sonorous terms but as sequences of
lithe, sharply characterised movements full of neat wind figuration (from
the oboes in particular) and carefully marshalled, airy strings. Bruggen
keeps his players on a loose rein, confident enough in their good sense to
leave much of the orchestra to make its own way while he concentrates on
shaping a musical strand or watching over its progress. His buoyancy and
freshness are infectious; even Bach suites, familiar enough now in their
authentic garb, emerge newly illuminated.
A conductor was not required for the E major Violin Concerto; the soloist
Elizabeth Wallfisch directed it herself. Her playing was neat and carefully
detailed, but the effect was just a little too monochrome, especially
alongside the other glowingly coloured performances. Bruggen himself also
explored three movements from Bach cantatas, each with another existence in
an instrumental work. The Sinfonia from Geist und Seele wird verwirret seems
to have begun life as part of an organ concerto, that for Wir danken dir,
Gott, wir danken dir is a parody of the prelude from the E major violin
sonata; both have virtuoso organ obbligatos, expertly dispatched here by
John Toll. The sonatina from Gottes zeit, ist die allerbeste Zeit proved to
be a strange little funeral study, with pairs of keening recorders and viole
de gamba; it made a sharp contrast to the grander music all about it, a
moment of intimacy in an evening of extrovert accomplishment.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Technology: Aladdin's cave - Andrew Baxter explains why the
east German engineering sector is a mine of metal expertise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Discovering signs of life in the east German machine tool industry is almost
as hard as finding traces of the Berlin wall, whose overnight dismemberment
has turned whole sectors of manufacturing into mere shadows of their former
selves.
An industry which in 1990 ranked ninth in the world with production worth
more than Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) has seen employment fall from about
100,000 before reunification to 15,000-18,000. But the collapse is only half
the story.
Among west European machine tool builders, the perception of the east German
industry was as a producer of solid, unexciting machines, mechanically sound
but with outdated control systems, and tawdry, unproductive factories.
Much of the manufacturing capacity has now been swept away along with the
industry's markets in the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe. And there
has been little reason for west German machine tool builders to make
acquisitions - they have enough problems of their own and do not need extra
manufacturing capacity.
Even in a recession, however, machine tool companies are interested in
technologies which have the potential to transform the economics of one of
the industries to which they provide manufacturing equipment.
Such is the case with Bad Duben Profilwalzmaschinen, based in the spa town
of Bad Duben near Leipzig. A few months after reunification, the company was
purchased by Germany's Pittler Group, one of the world's largest machine
tool companies.
The main attraction of Bad Duben for Pittler was its development of ring
rolling, a technology that is often viewed as a holy grail in industries
such as the bearing sector which uses accurate, hard-wearing rings in high
quantities.
Ring rolling has been around for about 15 years, and for ring producers
offers an alternative to machining. Instead of using a turning centre to cut
a ring from a blank, a section of steel tube is loaded on to a mandrel - a
cylindrical rod around which metal is shaped. When the mandrel rolls it
expands the blank into its correct shape against a profile forming roll,
with a smaller round rolling unit to control roundness (see graphic).
There are disadvantages in the process. The original ring has to be
extremely accurate, which requires some initial work in a lathe, and there
are size limitations. Bad Duben's URWA 100 machine will produce rings up to
120mm but, with Pittler's encouragement, is now developing larger capacity
models up to 250mm.
But the process is fast - as little as three seconds per ring - and the end
product has an accurate, high-quality finish that, says Pittler, reduces the
need for finish grinding. And, perhaps most importantly, the forming process
can increase the component's performance by up to 50 per cent, raising the
possibility of using lighter bearings to do the same job.
It is partly because metal-forming can improve the quality and strength of a
previously low-grade material that the entire eastern bloc is an 'Aladdin's
cave' for R&amp;D of cold-forming techniques, says Peter Standring, senior
lecturer at Nottingham University's Department of Manufacturing Engineering.
A second reason for the eastern bloc's prowess in metal-forming, he says,
was the central control of its machine tool industries. Ideas from
universities would be given to sin-gle, large companies to develop.
This was what happened at Bad Duben, which began work on ring-rolling in
1982 in collaboration with a Dresden academic. The company was founded in
1943 and gained many years of experience in the technology of cold forming.
By 1989 it was a world leader in machines for rolling rings, screws and gear
parts used in the automotive, aerospace and other industries.
It also, naturally, had some of the ideological baggage that bedevilled east
European industry and stifled its products' market potential. Unwilling to
talk to western companies which it feared were after its secrets, it was
allowed to talk only to the Koreans and Japanese - and ended up seeing some
of its ideas copied.
After the fall of the Berlin wall, the Rothenberger brothers who control
Pittler were among the first to make contact with the east German machine
tool industry.
Bad Duben had been identified as a target in 1988-89. 'We thought it would
make a good addition to our range,' says Dieter Weidemann, chairman of
Pittler. The group has also regained indirect control of Drema, a
Leipzig-based producer of multi-spindle autos founded in 1889 by the
original Wilhelm von Pittler, and is discussing a third takeover.
Since its takeover Bad Duben's profile has been transformed - the west has
taken over from eastern Europe as its biggest market, although volumes are
much lower.
For Pittler, the main task now is to develop Bad Duben's ring-rolling
technology further, and its markets for this and other products in the west.
Ring-rolling is not unique to Bad Duben, but the company claims to be ahead
of its competitors in solving some of the technique's inherent
disadvantages. It is working, for example, on a process for rolling
asymmetrical shapes, which could be ready in the next two years.
According to Standring, Bad Duben's technology is excellent, but
ring-rolling will be able to match the economics of conventional turning
only for high-value added components. The tubing for the original blank
costs more than a solid blank, and there is not much to be gained in speed
when compared with modern automated turning machines, he says. But the
process could be attractive to producers of bearing rings designed for
applications where quality is paramount, such as in aerospace.
The challenge for Pittler is to convince the bearing industry of the
benefits of Bad Duben's ring-rolling technology. This is not easy during a
recession that is making bearing producers wary about making equipment
purchases, and in an industry that is coalescing around a handful of major
producers.
But if a bearing producer fears that a competitor could gain a permanent
cost advantage, it could be forced to follow suit. Unfortunately, though,
the bearing industry is fanatically secretive about its manufacturing
technology, and Pittler and Bad Duben might then find themselves having to
keep a low profile.

A vital part of Microsoft's eagerly awaited Windows NT operating system has
been developed by a small UK communications software company which now plans
to sell it to the world at large.
Data Connection of Enfield, North London, is supplying universal messaging
technology for the new operating system which is expected to be launched
next year.
It is the only element in Microsoft's new flagship system which is being
developed by a UK company. The system is Data Connection's own version of an
industry standard called X400, an important ingredient in the OSI open
systems specifications. X400 includes electronic mail, electronic data
interchange, secure messaging and file transfer.
According to Ian Ferguson, Data Connection managing director, the company's
DCX. 400 system is the first that works well and can be installed easily by
customers. Conventional electronic mail systems cannot handle document or
file transfers, while electronic document interchange systems cannot handle
electronic mail, he says.
Data Connection is offering the DCX. 400 to companies which want to
incorporate it into their own products and to corporations planning to build
custom electronic messaging systems. A licence starts at around Pounds
150,000.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Technology: Knowing no bounds - Louise Kehoe looks at
Microsoft's ambitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ambitions of Microsoft know no bounds. Not content to dominate the
market for software run on stand-alone PCs, the world's largest software
company now aims to extend its reach into 'workgroup' computing.
'We are seeing the world evolve from islands of information on individual
workstations to groups of people collaborating on shared information,' says
Bill Gates, Microsoft chairman and chief executive. He aims to put Microsoft
in the forefront of this 'PC evolution' with a rush of new products over the
next six to nine months.
The PC remains at the centre of Gates's world but his strategy reflects the
view that networked PCs will eventually take over the traditional role of
minicomputers and even mainframe computers in corporate computing.
Workgroup computing is emerging as a way to use PCs to enhance office
productivity. Instead of only speeding up the ability of individuals to
write memos or calculate budgets, workgroup software enables teams of people
to collaborate on projects more efficiently.
The first step in Microsoft's grand plan will emerge later this month with
the introduction of 'Windows for Workgroups', a new version of Microsoft's
popular 'Windows' that incorporates networking programs enabling each member
of a group to share information, send electronic mail and schedule group
meetings.
By incorporating basic workgroup functions into its Windows operating
system, Microsoft aims to expand the market for workgroup computing and
encourage more PC users to link their machines to networks. Currently only
about 30 per cent of Microsoft Windows users are linked to networks.
But this is 'just the beginning', Microsoft says. Its next move will be to
launch a database program that simplifies the development of applications
such as order entry and inventory tracking. These programs will set the
stage for 'Windows NT', Microsoft's next-generation operating system, now
expected some time in the first half of 1993. This, the most ambitious of
Microsoft's efforts, is designed to provide PC-like 'ease of use' on
company-wide computer network systems.
Yet all of this comes from a company which, despite its successes, has so
far lagged behind competitors in providing software that links PCs on
networks and in applications geared to more than one user. Neither does
Microsoft have any experience beyond PC software which, however important it
may be, lacks the maturity of programs developed for larger systems.
Microsoft faces 'a boatload of competitors', acknowledges Steve Ballmer,
executive vice president of sales and support. He lists Apple Computer,
which already provides networking and workgroup software; Borland, with its
database programs; and Lotus Development with its 'Notes' program for
workgroup communications. IBM and Sun Microsystems are also competitors.
The immediate obstacle to Microsoft's ambitions, however, is Novell, which
commands a 60 per cent share of the market for network operating systems. To
date, Microsoft is running a poor second to Novell in the networking
software stakes.
None the less, Microsoft's vision is compelling. By extending the familiar
easy-to-use features of Windows and not forcing PC users to adapt to new
applications programs, Microsoft can provide a relatively painless path from
personal computing to workgroup or company-wide computing.
It is a scheme that will have great appeal for growing companies and for a
generation of computer users whose experience is based upon the personal
computer. 'We view workgroup computing as an evolutionary process,' says
Ballmer. 'Users should be able to use the applications and operating systems
they are familiar with, and be able to pick and choose the elements they
need for their particular workgroup.'
Microsoft also stresses the 'openness' of its approach including
connectivity to systems running other operating systems and 'gateways' to
existing mainframe- or minicomputer- based systems. Hewlett-Packard and
Digital Equipment have been close partners with Microsoft throughout its
development process, the company says.
However, with its fuselage of promises it appears that Microsoft's ultimate
goal may be to become, as IBM was in the 1970s and early 1980s, the software
standards setter of the 1990s. The question will be whether computer users
and manufacturers are ready to accept Microsoft in that role.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Redrawing the
Pentagram blueprint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For years, Pentagram has been a beacon of stability in the turbulent world
of the London design industry.
Pentagram has clung to its original, early-1970s concept of operating as a
partnership of studios, run by individual designers. It was criticised for
being too cautious in the bullish 1980s. But at a time when the rest of the
industry has been blitzed by receiverships and redundancies, Pentagram has
been unscathed by recession and is seen as a role model by the young
designers of the 1990s.
There have been changes over the years. Pentagram has taken on three new
partners in London and has opened offices in New York and San Francisco, run
as independent partnerships. But the structure has stayed the same and the
five founders - Theo Crosby, Alan Fletcher, Kenneth Grange, Mervyn Kurlansky
and Colin Forbes - have all remained.
Pentagram is now poised for change. Fletcher is leaving to go freelance.
Forbes, who opened the New York office in 1987, retires next autumn.
Kurlansky is assessing the feasibility of opening an office in continental
Europe which would involve him leaving London. The London office is taking
on two new partners - Daniel Weil and David Pocknell. Pentagram is about to
discover whether its structure really is a durable formula, or if its
success so far has been due to the individuals involved.
The blueprint for Pentagram was invented by Forbes and one of his clients,
Ian Hay Davidson, then a partner at Arthur Andersen, the accountancy group.
They devised a cellular structure, based on legal and accountancy
partnerships, whereby individual designers worked from their own studios
while sharing central resources such as accounts and public relations.
The main difference between Pentagram and its role models was that there was
to be no hierarchy.
This egalitarian ethos has dominated public perceptions of Pentagram ever
since. The partners at each office receive the same salaries and equal
shares of annual profits. They work for large commercial clients such as
Kodak, Boots and Reuters, but also have strong creative credentials. Crosby
and Weil both teach at London's Royal College of Art as well as running
commercial studios.
But behind the liberal facade lies a labyrinth of rigid financial controls.
Pentagram, one of London's larger design groups with turnover of just under
Pounds 5m last year, is run much more rigorously than most conventional
design companies.
Each partner is set the financial target of covering costs and making a 25
per cent profit margin. Costs are calculated according to the number of
people in the partners' studios - with employees graded in five salary bands
 -and their proportionate share of central overheads. This system is
self-supportive, in that it can cushion partners through difficult years,
but also ensures there is strong peer pressure on them to meet their
targets.
New recruits are subject to the same rigorous scrutiny. They join as
'partners-elect' on the same salaries as full partners but with no profit
share. They then have two or three years to prove that they can perform
financially.
So far, Pentagram has had mixed success with newcomers. There have been
seven partners-elect in London since 1972 and only three - John McConnell,
David Hillman and John Rushworth - have so far become full partners. 'It is
a risk when we take on new people,' says McConnell. 'But we've got to do it
to make sure that Pentagram has a future. That's why we've brought in Daniel
Weil and David Pocknell.'
Meanwhile, the three international offices must fill the vacuum left by
Forbes. Although Pentagram purports to be non-hierarchical, Forbes has
always acted as de facto chairman. His retirement has forced the other
partners to question whether they can continue without a formal structure
for decision making. Their solution is to create a steering committee of
representatives from the three offices which will elect a chairman for a
three year period, the first being McConnell.
The combination of these changes in personnel and structure present a
formidable challenge for Pentagram. 'The next few years are certainly going
to be interesting,' says McConnell. 'Although that's probably a rather coy
way of describing it.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Accountancy Column: Municipal Mutual and the insolvency
quagmire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL troubles of Municipal Mutual, the company which insures nine
out of 10 local authorities and many individuals, have once more brought the
spotlight on to the need for urgent reform of insolvency legislation.
While policyholders - as well the beneficiaries of local government services
and poll tax payers around the UK - are watching for the immediate outcome
of negotiations with MMI over its future, MMI's problems have emphasised how
greater attention should be paid to the wider framework within which the
insurance business operates.
Every recent case of an insurance company experiencing difficulties has
powerfully illustrated the argument for reform. Two issues in particular
need to be addressed: the tools used by regulators to scrutinise corporate
financial health, and insolvency procedures available when a company is
unable to continue operating.
One of the most immediate concerns for MMI's creditors - stoked by criticism
from the Labour party - is the role of the Department of Trade and Industry.
As the regulator of insurance companies, should it have intervened more
vigorously when signs of trouble first emerged?
MMI's difficulties did not come as a surprise. A heavily qualified audit
report in the accounts for the year to December 31 last year, which was
issued this July, showed clearly that the company had fallen below the
statutory minimum solvency margin.
The message resounded among MMI's leading creditors, represented by the
Association of Metropolitan Authorities, Association of District Councils,
Association of County Councils and the Convention of Scottish Local
Authorities. These organisations hired accountants at Touche Ross to
investigate.
Touche Ross's report issued at the end of September concluded: 'There is a
strong possibility that MMI will cease trading in the very near future and
be placed in some form of insolvency proceedings  .. We recommend that the
associations advise members to seek alternative cover when policies are due
for renewal.'
The DTI was clearly not in the dark either. It said last week that it had
been in discussions with the directors of MMI over the future of the company
at least as far back as March. It held back from using its powers to request
a winding-up petition.
Criteria used by the DTI for assessing viability are somewhat opaque. They
include a series of qualitative as well as quantitative measures such as
profitability, liquidity and strength of setting aside reserves against
future claims.
Fundamental and enshrined in law, however, is the solvency margin, which is
defined as the ratio of a company's net assets (its capital and free
reserves) to the amount of premium income received in a given year. It
measures the ability to pay claims.
The DTI stresses that there is no single magic figure for the ratio below
which it will act. Legislation - notably the 1982 Insurance Act - lays down
specific formulas by which it can be calculated for different companies.
Officials say they might normally be content if the figure is twice the 16
per cent minimum set down in EC regulations.
The solvency ratio is also widely used by brokers and analysts. But many are
becoming disillusioned with its effectiveness. It ought to be a proxy for
the scale of risk being assumed. The stronger a company's capital base, the
less the chance of it being unable to pay claims and the more insurance it
can sell.
Yet that was no help in assessing Trinity Insurance, for example, which had
a very high solvency margin and yet still became insolvent earlier this
year.
The ratio's limitations include the fact that it does not measure the level
and adequacy of claims reserves. It takes no account of the level of risk
involved. Paradoxically, increasing premiums could reduce the ratio, while
cutting premiums to uneconomic levels would increase it.
The ratio does not show the strength of a company's financial base, the
details of its reinsurance arrangements, the type of insurance it
underwrote, or the size of its management expenses.
Finally, assessments of the lowest acceptable level of solvency vary between
regulators and the market, as well as over time. As a result, using the
ratio is fraught with difficulties.
A more fundamental problem is that the DTI's powers as a regulator are
limited. If an insurance company breaches its solvency margin, all the
department can ultimately do to petition the court via the secretary of
state to appoint liquidators. There is little flexibility between that
extreme and simply continuing discussions with a stricken company.
That raises a wider point about the nature of insolvency proceedings for
insurance companies. The existing law is not compatible with the structure
of the sector, at least as far as non-life companies with 'long-tail'
business are concerned.
A whole series of difficulties arise if a insurance company is liquidated.
There are legal disputes about whether reinsurers have to pay claims to such
a company in full. The insurance market is disrupted. Policyholders
experience lengthy, costly and tortuous procedures.
Perhaps most important, it takes many years before creditors can be paid. It
is impossible to pay out until all liabilities are established. These rise
regularly as actuaries adjust future claims each time new legal settlements
occur. Meanwhile, insolvency practitioners are reluctant to pay out interim
dividends since they are personally liable if they over-estimate the amount
to be paid out.
There are two intermediate solutions. An informal scheme of arrangement, or
a formal scheme under Section 425 of the 1985 Companies Act, would allow a
more orderly run-off of existing insurance business with claims being paid
as they arise.
But such negotiations are extremely delicate and time-consuming. A formal
scheme requires support from at least 75 per cent of creditors by value. The
first example of such a formal scheme, applied in the case of a small
company called Monument Re., has only just been approved after nine months
of discussions.
Reptition on a larger scale will not prove easy. The directors of Walbrook,
the insurance and reinsurance company with gross liabilities of more than
Dollars 2bn, attempted to put together an innovative informal scheme in July
with its leading creditors. But they refused to co-operate, and the company
is now in a formal scheme with liquidators appointed.
With MMI, the challenge could be equally great, given that the company will
have to cope with claims from more than one million individual and local
authority policyholders.
The logical alternative - which was made possible under the 1986 insolvency
act - is administration, the nearest UK equivalent to Chapter 11 in the USA.
That would grant the company protection against its creditors, and give it
time to re-organise in an attempt to continue operating. Yet for unknown
reasons, the insolvency act specifically excluded insurance companies from
eligibility.
Administration still has limitations. As currently drafted, only two of its
four strategies are feasible for insurers: a formal or an informal scheme of
arrangement. Mr Colin Bird, an insolvency partner at Price Waterhouse, has
recently been discussing changes to the law with the DTI which would
introduce a fifth approach.
Mr Bird and a number of his colleagues would like to see the DTI able to
impose insolvency proceedings which would allow run-off to take place. That
would allow the practitioners taking control of a company to pay at least a
proportion of claims as they arise, and give a quicker and less expensive
solution for creditors. Without change in legislation, there can be little
assurance for creditors to insolvent insurers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Rationalisation at the head office of aggregates group Evered Bardon, where
staffing levels have virtually halved in the past 14 months, has led to the
jobs of commercial manager and company secretary being rolled into one. Tim
Grimes, who was company secretary of Evered between 1986 and 1991, and who
has since been commercial manager of the merged Evered Bardon, now reassumes
the role as company secretary as well.
This leaves David Kaye, who had taken over as company secretary in 1991
after previously being commercial manager, without a job. 'There was nothing
else to offer him; the parting was perfectly amicable,' says chief executive
Peter Tom, who was chairman and chief executive of Bardon, before Evered and
Bardon came together last year.
Grimes had initially wanted to leave before the merger, but stayed on in a
consultancy role for two months in early summer of 1991. He then changed his
mind and took the job of commercial manager.

FT  08 OCT 92 / People: Midland casualty returns to consultancy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
American Gene Lockhart, who used to be Britain's highest paid banker, hasn't
taken long to find a new job. The former chief executive of Midland Bank's
UK banking operations has returned to his old firm, New York's First
Manhattan Consulting Group.
The 42-year-old Lockhart, who was thrown out of work after the Hong Kong
takeover of Midland in July, says that he 'had four or five offers' to run
US banks. However, he decided to go back into consultancy so that he could
make some 'real money'.
He has been appointed president of First Manhattan Consulting International.
First Manhattan, which specialises in advising financial services companies,
is not represented in London but Lockhart plans to rectify this and says
that he expects to spend between a third and a half of his time in the UK.
Although Midland Bank's problems before the takeover have received
considerable attention, Lockhart is generally reckoned to have done a good
job in turning round the UK banking business. When he joined Midland in 1987
as head of its group operations he was the first foreigner to be made an
executive director of a UK clearing bank.
During the two years he headed Midland's UK banking business, he increased
operating profits by over 70 per cent, reversing a five-year decline. He
reduced the workforce by 15 per cent, increased net interest margins by 30
per cent and introduced a number of innovations such as Firstdirect
telephone banking service which attracted over 200,000 new customers from
other banks.
Although some comment-ators have questioned whether Midland's standards of
service suffered during Lockhart's brief regime, he describes his time there
as 'very successful' and plans to apply the lessons learnt to other banks.
Meanwhile, there is no news yet of what Dutchman George Loudon, the former
chief executive of Midland Montagu and the other high profile casualty of
the Midland takeover, is doing. Before joining Midland, Loudon had held
senior positions with McKinsey &amp; Co and Amro Bank.

FT  08 OCT 92 / CBI report says multinational employers seeking to encourage
'expatriate' European workers to accept local pay packages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MULTINATIONAL employers are increasingly seeking to encourage 'expatriate'
European workers to accept local pay packages, according to a report
published by the Confederation of British Industry, Lisa Wood writes.
Employers are finding it easier to do this because pay is converging more
across borders, says the report. It is based on a survey by the CBI's
employee relocation unit and William M. Mercer Fraser, employee benefits
consultants. The report says that traditionally expatriate remuneration
systems were designed to provide incentives to employees to accept
assignments away from home and to compensate them for any additional costs
incurred in relocation.
Attitudes are said to be changing for several reasons, not least because in
western Europe the movement of people is becoming more widely accepted. Many
employers want to create a more homogeneous workforce and believe they have
to develop plans to phase out differentials in pay packages between
employees transferred from one location to another - expatriates - and local
staff.
The report says, however, that implementation of a true host-based system
for all employees is not realistic in the immediate future. There are, for
example, too many external factors hindering progress in the near future
over which the professionals have no control, such as the portability of
pensions.

FT  08 OCT 92 / CBI sees little risk of pay spiral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANGER of a price-wage spiral developing as a result of Britain's
withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism is 'limited' given the present
weak state of the labour market, according to the Confederation of British
Industry.
The latest CBI pay and performance analysis for 1992-93 warns, however, that
if 'employers do not keep a firm grip on pay and continue to improve
performance, the benefits (of ERM withdrawal) will be squandered through
higher inflation'.
Over the past year UK earnings growth has finally fallen below the EC
average. But the CBI points out that the EC figure has been inflated by high
increases in Germany which will not last and that the UK is still well above
US and Japanese levels. In the three years to 1991 unit labour cost
increases in the UK were higher than in the US and Japan and higher than the
European average. This year the UK has done better, 'but not well enough to
regain lost ground'. The CBI argues that employees have become much more
realistic about pay, with survey evidence showing that 65 per cent of
employees expect their next pay increase to be the same or lower than last
year. Two thirds of employers now have performance pay for some or all of
their white-collar staff while one in four has it for manual workers.
Mr Howard Davies, CBI director-general, repeats his plea for a freeze on the
overall pay bill in the public sector. But the CBI itself estimates that the
1992-93 pay rise for nurses is likely to be 5.7 per cent, the armed forces
more than 5 per cent and teachers 7.5 per cent. Manufacturing pay increases
remain around 4 per cent. Since 1979 white-collar average earnings have
risen 38 per cent compared with 11 per cent for blue-collar staff. That has
prompted the CBI to ask members to take a closer look at white-collar pay
and push for more 'multi-skilling' for such workers.
In terms of output per worker, UK manufacturers moved closer to German
competitors in the late 1980s but there has been some slippage since the
recession began.
The CBI now estimates that absence from work is costing British business
Pounds 7.5bn a year - equivalent to 3 per cent of the pay bill.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Campaign to avoid unkindest cut of all: Alan Pike reports on
the lengths to which London's teaching hospitals are going to escape closure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Charity Commission yesterday asked St Thomas' Hospital in London for
details on the spending of Pounds 160,000-worth of charitable funds in a
campaign to promote the hospital's image.
St Thomas' is one of several central London teaching hospitals facing
possible closure in a report due to reach Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health
secretary, next week.
As the deadline for submission of the report has approached, London managers
have increasingly abandoned the air of professional calm that prevails on
their wards in a high-profile struggle for survival.
Threatened hospitals have not awaited the findings of Sir Bernard Tomlinson,
former chairman of the Northern Regional Health Authority, before launching
campaigns to promote their achievements and try to deflect the closure
decisions elsewhere.
The Charity Commission said yesterday it had asked the St Thomas' management
for more details on the expenditure and would look at the precise
arrangements under which its charitable trusts operated.
Mr Tim Matthews, the hospital's chief executive, defended the decision to
spend Pounds 160,770 on consultancy and publicity work, saying it would be a
'disaster' for healthcare in London if St Thomas' closed.
In the City, St Bartholomew's hospital - like St Thomas' a possible
candidate for closure - yesterday lost its commander at the crucial stage in
the battle. Dr Ken Grant, its chief executive and one of the best-known
figures in National Health Service management, resigned saying he wished to
develop his career in public health and tropical medicine.
North-east Thames Regional Health Authority denied that Dr Grant's decision
to leave now was linked to the likely outcome of the Tomlinson report. Many
of his colleagues at St Bartholomew's yesterday feared otherwise.
All the threatened hospitals can argue individual cases for survival, as
their campaigns are proving. St Thomas', which last month ran a 16-page
special supplement in a south London local newspaper, stresses its role as
the capital's leading accident and emergency centre.
St Bartholomew's emphasises its importance as the 'local' hospital to the
300,000 people who commute to the City each weekday.
But the wrong battle is being fought as London's hospitals square up to each
other. None of the managers, while crusading for the survival of their own
institutions, denies that rationalisation is needed.
At St George's, a south-west London teaching hospital, concern about the
likely implications of the Tomlinson report was yesterday temporarily
interrupted by a fire. If London teaching hospitals were private companies,
the state of their finances would guarantee that any fire was followed by
police and insurance investigations.
They have lost out badly in the contract-based system of financing
healthcare introduced last year - the government is spending an extra Pounds
50m this year just to keep central London services going while Sir Bernard
completes his recommendations. All century, reports have drawn attention to
an excess of hospital capacity in central London. The new funding system
means action can be delayed no longer.
Closures are certain, although the Tomlinson report may come up with other
uses for some of the buildings. But many health specialists fear that a
losing-battle to save prized institutions is already diverting attention
from the more pressing question of the shape of healthcare after the
closures have taken place.
The British Medical Association has decided, before publication of the
Tomlinson report, to focus on these broader issues and not back campaigns to
save particular hospitals.
While this has not pleased some BMA members in the threatened hospitals, the
association believes it must concentrate on ensuring that medical resources
released by the closures are transferred to other parts of the country,
maintaining a balanced hospital service in London and building up the
capital's general practitioner and community health services.
Development of non-hospital services in London is a crucial element to any
hospital closures. On many measurements, Londoners are poorly served by
family doctors compared with people elsewhere in the country.
The proportion of GPs above the age of 65 is 130 per cent higher than the
English average. Many of these, like some younger GPs, work single-handedly
from unsuitable premises.
There are more GPs with list-sizes of more than 2,500 patients in London
than elsewhere, while only 40 per cent of London GPs are equipped to carry
out minor surgery - little more than half the national average.
The King's Fund Health Policy Centre, in what was widely regarded as a
foretaste of the Tomlinson report, argued in June for a rationalisation
programme that would reduce hospital beds in London by up to 25 per cent
over the next 15 years, with funds diverted to improving primary and
community services.
At a time of tight public spending pressures the real test of London's
health service campaigners will be to ensure that, even if they fail to save
some famous hospitals, the closure process goes hand-in-hand with the
extensive renewal of local services.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Engineers' salaries outstrip inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASES in engineers' pay have outpaced inflation in the past three years,
a survey published yesterday shows.
The survey compiled for the Engineering Council said that incorporated
engineers and engineering technicians, mainly support staff, had won
increases 10.3 percentage points above the rise in the retail prices index
in the three years to April 5 1992, pushing their average annual earnings up
by 31.7 per cent to Pounds 23,483.
It also said that chartered engineers, mainly project leaders, had won rises
7.2 percentage points above inflation over the period, pushing their average
annual earnings to Pounds 31,768.
Mr Denis Filer, Engineering Council director, said: 'The industry is now
paying salaries which recognise the value and output of engineers.'
Engineers' pay had fallen behind other professions, but rises have been 1
point higher than other professional groups every year since 1988, he said.
The gap between engineers who would recommend the profession to young men
and those who would recommend it to young women is far narrower than it was
in 1989.
More than 75 per cent of engineers would now recommend the profession to
young women. More than 80 per cent of chartered engineers and 77 per cent of
incorporated engineers would recommend the profession to young men.
The survey of 8,000 workers also showed that about 75 per cent of all
engineers and technicians had undertaken further training.
The council said that 11,000 of the 18,000 engineers who had qualified for
the European Community's professional engineering qualification, the Eur
Ing, were British.
The proportion of incorporated engineers contracted to work 37.5 hours or
more a week has fallen to 49.5 per cent, the lowest level since the surveys
began in 1979.

Mrs Shephard is not expected to announce the abolition of the councils -
which set minimum pay rates for nearly 10 per cent of the workforce - in

of recent correspondence with her, that she will include abolition in this

Ms Mo Mowlam, shadow minister for women, published a report arguing that

Mrs Shephard has written to the Equal Opportunities Commission pointing out
there was a clear body of research demonstrating 'the relationship between
higher pay and fewer jobs'.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Treasury chief plans to open up his 'praetorian guard':
Peter Marsh on the hard task facing Sir Terry Burns in his effort to make
officials change their secretive ways
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING banker who is a member of an exclusive dining club which brings
together people from the City and Whitehall says of Treasury officials: 'I
have been talking to them for 10 years and find them decent individuals. But
my distinct impression is that they have closed minds.'
Comments such as this must have been echoing through the mind of Sir Terry
Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, as he addressed his top 70 officials in
an unusual meeting on Monday. The taciturn Sir Terry hired a conference room
at the Institution of Civil Engineers to tell some of Whitehall's leading
mandarins to change their ways.
He told the seminar how the 'new' Treasury might operate in devising tax and
monetary policy and controlling public spending. It would be less secretive,
more flexible and have fuller and more detailed contacts with the outside
world, particularly the City and industry.
Sir Terry took over as the Treasury's top official last year after being
chief economic adviser since 1980. The meeting was in response to criticism
of the department.
The Treasury has been attacked by politicians and industrialists for failing
to judge the path of Britain's longest recession for 50 years and for making
over-optimistic forecasts. Its tactics last month in trying to defend the
pound ahead of the dramatic exit from the exchange rate mechanism were
widely disparaged in the City for lacking foresight and imagination.
According to some critics, many of the Treasury's problems stem from an
introverted management style which provides too few opportunities for top
officials to glean insights and ideas from outside Whitehall.
Most of the top cadre at the Treasury are Oxbridge educated, have been in
Whitehall or similar administrative environments all their working lives and
have little experience of commerce. People who know the Treasury talk of it
as a priesthood, or a 'praetorian guard'. Much of this talk is fostered by
top officials, some of whom are keen to portray themselves as rather
special.
At least one senior Treasury official thinks that the complexities of the
department's job in the centre of policymaking require it to keep its
distance from outsiders. If it became too close to the City or companies,
the department could be accused of being swayed in its judgments by
lobbying, for instance over financial legislation or tax policy.
Another view is that the Treasury has taken the concept of aloofness too
far. Mr Tim Parker, a former Treasury economist who is chief executive of
Kenwood, a kitchen-equipment maker, says Treasury officials do not know
enough about 'the process of wealth creation in industry' to do their jobs
adequately.
Some critics believe that top Treasury officials have become too closely
identified with Tory ministers. They say this is nothing to do with the
political beliefs of the Treasury's upper echelons but stems from a lack of
internal debate.
Sir Douglas Wass, Treasury permanent secretary from 1974 to 1983, says:
'Among today's top Treasury advisers, there is no one who has views about
the economy which differ substantially from those of ministers.'
This closing of ranks within the Treasury - about matters such as the lack
of need for an industrial policy and the role of the exchange rate as
opposed to the money supply in determining inflationary pressures - may have
been acceptable when the economy was booming as it was during the late
1980s.
Now that Britain is stuck in a long recession - and has lost its central
plank of economic policy in the shape of ERM membership - it seems
appropriate for the department to want to put out more feelers as to how it
should adapt in the 1990s.
As Sir Terry tries to flesh out his plans - which lack detail and are being
presented as a 'green paper' for internal discussion - he and his 1,500
colleagues in the Treasury's policy divisions face several headaches.
One is that Sir Terry - as the great survivor in the government's most
important department over the past decade - may find his own credibility
damaged by the recent policymaking catastrophes.
It will also remain difficult for the Treasury to attract top people from
commerce and finance when civil servants' salaries are often half that on
offer in private industry.
And the desire spelled out by Sir Terry for more openness in the Treasury's
work may sit uneasily with ministers' wish for secrecy, for example over
sensitive areas such as Treasury economic forecasts.
Finally, he and his colleagues still have to sort out the most pressing
issue facing the Treasury, in the shape of how to formulate a viable
post-ERM economic strategy.
Sir Terry - who is said to believe the Treasury culture is 'two thirds
satisfactory' but the rest needs a lot of work - faces some knotty problems
ahead.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Companies urged on community
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES need to develop new measures to assess their ability to meet and
manage demands of all 'stakeholders' or those affected by their operations,
a conference of the Royal Society of Arts in London was told yesterday.
A series of speakers stressed the importance of measures assessing the
satisfaction of customers, suppliers, employees and the wider community as
well as shareholders.
They were addressing a seminar which is part of the RSA's three-year
research project into the role of business in a changing world. This is
designed to lead to a 'scoreboard' of measures which could be included in
companies' annual reports in the future.
Mr Roger Stubbs, deputy managing director of market research company Mori,
revealed a poll showing that 80 per cent of the public and 42 per cent of
analysts believe British companies do not pay enough attention to their
treatment of the environ-ment.
Protection of the environment is seen as the most important corporate social
responsibility by institutional investors, followed by employee welfare,
employee rewards and service to the community.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Printing industry sees more job cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 80 per cent of the printing industry is not working at full
capacity and more redundancies are expected, according to the industry's
latest quarterly review.
The British Printing Industries Federation said three months ago seven out
of 10 printers had forecast an improvement in general trading conditions but
fewer than one in 10 had actually experienced an improvement.
The latest survey shows that half the industry shed jobs in the past three
months and one in five printers expect to cut more jobs this quarter. Only
20 per cent of the industry sees the outlook brightening.
'The industry sees nothing to suggest that any fundamental recovery is under
way,' the survey says.
Printing companies thought the decision to leave the European exchange rate
mechanism could be beneficial, but many expressed concern that any benefit
was offset by the uncertainty created by 'the government's wavering
policies'.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Japan seen to be victim of bias by newspapers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COVERAGE of Japan in many British national newspapers is negative and biased
with a heavy concentration on whale hunting, war atrocity and 'funny Jap'
stories, according to a new study.
The survey - by Professor Douglas Anthony, professor of Japanese studies at
Cardiff University, and sponsored by Andersen Consulting - was based on a
study of the national and regional press from January to June 1991. Each
article was rated as positive, neutral or negative.
The mass-market tabloids, with the exception of the Daily Mirror, use
'viciousness, vacuity and sheer negative spitefulness in their treatment of
items on Japan', the report argues. However, Today and the Daily Mail both
had more neutral than negative stories.
Coverage in the broadsheet papers was much greater but still less than
Japan's size or importance merited.
The Financial Times had the most articles on Japan - 639. After that came
The Independent with 188 and The Times with 180. Such a high proportion of
the FT's coverage was judged to be neutral that it was not considered worth
making a full breakdown.
The Sunday broadsheets, apart from their financial pages, were largely
negative.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Cost of council cover 'to rise 50%'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNCILS face steep in-creases in insurance premiums as a result of the
demise of Municipal Mutual, the stricken insurer, a conference organised by
local-authority associations heard yesterday.
The increase could average at least 50 per cent from last year's estimated
total of Pounds 600m, according to the Labour-controlled Association of
Metropolitan Authorities.
Nine out of 10 councils bought their insurance from Municipal Mutual, which
stopped writing new business and renewing existing policies last week,
leaving a number of councils temporarily without insurance cover.
Municipal Mutual, which is still seeking to sell its home, motor, life and
health insurance businesses, is again meeting claims from policyholders
after temporarily suspending payments last week.
Mr Ken Kennedy, risk and facilities manager with Surrey County Council,
warned the meeting that insurers would increase rates and 'saw councils as
ripe for the picking'.
Risk prevention was necessary for councils to 'lever' improved rates out of
their insurers, Mr Kennedy added.
However the associations say that the spending restrictions imposed by the
government could make it difficult for many councils to improve risk
prevention.
'We will happily undertake better risk management,' said Mr Clive Grenyer,
under-secretary of the Tory-led Association of County Councils, 'but it
costs money and we are financially constrained'.
Spending on measures including sprinklers and alarms was needed to improve
the security of schools vulnerable to arson, but such spending could be
subject to government controls on capital spending, said Mr Grenyer.
The cost of installing sprinklers in a school can be between Pounds 15,000
and Pounds 25,000.
He added that local-authority association leaders had made the point
forcibly to ministers during recent meetings.
Mr Colin Hamling, liability underwriter with St Paul International, said
councils must improve management to reduce claims. He added that many minor
claims stemmed from lack of maintenance and were avoidable.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Banks urged to save Jubilee Line plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY Wharf's admin-istrators will today make a last attempt to prevent the
government shelving the plan to extend the Jubilee Underground line to east
London.
They will ask the 11 commercial bank creditors of the development to make a
no-strings offer to the government of a Pounds 390m contribution to the
Jubilee Line's Pounds 1.6bn costs.
Separately, construction industry leaders warned yesterday against
cancelling the extension. Mr Frank Kennedy, a director of Wimpey, a
contractor bidding for Jubilee work, said: 'To scrap the project when the
construction industry is on its knees would not just be brutal but extremely
ill-judged.'
Mr John Hackett, director-general of the Federation of Civil Engineering
Contractors, said 4,000 construction jobs depended on the extension.
Mr Denis Tunnicliffe, managing director of London Underground, said if
transport ministers cancelled the project they 'will have to explain to the
Public Accounts Committee why they have already allowed us to spend Pounds
120m on it'.
Last week, the banks made an offer to the government conditional on the
Department of the Environment renting a building at Canary Wharf. The
government has consistently stressed that its commitment to build the
Jubilee Line extension if the private sector contributes Pounds 400m should
not in any way depend on government support, such as revenues from renting a
building to civil servants.
The banks' proposal involves paying Pounds 98m immediately and the rest over
25 years. The Treasury, which wants the line scrapped to reduce public
expenditure, is unhappy about the absence of a guarantee from the banks for
the later payments.
The banks have told the government that if the later payments are not made
it can have the undeveloped land around Canary Wharf. But undeveloped land
in Docklands has a minimal value.
One banker who will be at today's meeting said: 'We cannot drop the linkage
between the Jubilee contribution and getting rents from the government. It
is too important.'
The administrators - three partners of the accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young -
have also yet to win bank support for proposals to keep Canary Wharf afloat
if the Jubilee extension gets approval.
They have told the government the banks would probably be prepared to
provide Pounds 30m in new loans to Canary Wharf over the coming three years
to maintain the standard of services at the 15 new office buildings. Some
banks believe this would put the administrators under too little pressure to
sell the project.
The banks will also be given an evaluation by Goldman Sachs, US investment
bank, on whether they should drop their offer to the government in favour of
a separate highly complex offer to fund the Jubilee Line contribution which
has been made by the European Investment Bank.
A government official said the EIB offer, which can only be made formally if
the 11 commercial banks agree, would probably be rejected.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Transport at heart of Canary Wharf troubles: Robert Peston
reports on the difficulties the project faced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE government shelves construction of the Jubilee Line extension to east
London, Canary Wharf may go into liquidation, according to the projects'
bankers.
Mr Michael Dennis, the Canadian former law professor who spent more than
Pounds 1.5bn building the neo-classical ghost town in east London, says that
difficulties over adequate transport links have been at the heart of Canary
Wharf's problems since Lady Thatcher, then prime minister, drove the first
pile in 1988.
Last week Mr Dennis resigned after five years as chief executive of O&amp;Y
Canary Wharf Limited, the company set up by Mr Paul Reichmann to build the
15 monoliths which dominate the Docklands skyline.
He is moving to New York, where he plans to exploit a skill acquired in the
six months since Canary Wharf was placed in administration under UK
insolvency procedures - he will set up a company to provide capital and
management to troubled property developments.
Mr Dennis says his biggest mistake was not to take control of the
construction of transport links with central London. 'We should have
insisted (in negotiations with the government) that we take contractual
responsibility for infrastructure developments,' he said.
He blames the government for failing to meet its commitment to provide
adequate road and rail links. 'We undertook to build 5.6m sq ft of offices
in five years from mid 1987,' he said. 'We completed 6m sq ft in four years
and on budget.
'We also made a commitment to make Pounds 250m of expenditures on
infrastructure - the local roads, the roundabout, the parking. In exchange
the government sold to the company half the land on which Canary Wharf was
built and it undertook to build the Limehouse Link and upgrade the DLR.'
Responsibility for improving the Docklands Light Railway was given to London
Transport, and the London Docklands Development Corporation oversaw the
construction of the Limehouse Link road.
Mr Dennis said the government made a firm commitment to have an efficient
two-track service to Bank station in the City of London by early last year
and to pay monthly damages if that date was not met for a period of three
years and around Pounds 100m after that. 'We submitted a claim (for damages)
which is under review', he said.
In the case of the Limehouse Link, the development corporation contracted to
have it completed as far as Canary Wharf by autumn last year and the whole
thing by early this year. Mr Dennis said: 'It will now be at least a
year-and-a-half late.' The company had had 'extensive negotiations' with
half-a-dozen large potential tenants, 'three or four of whom spent well over
Pounds 100,000 on legal negotiations and planning of space'.
He insisted: 'All were very very serious. In every case the breaking point
was transport - they simply did not believe that the transport would be
there on time. That more than anything else was the stumbling block for the
success of Canary Wharf.'
He also believes that hopes of Canary Wharf avoiding liquidation and one day
becoming a commercial success depend to a large extent on yet another
infrastructure project - the extension of the Jubilee Underground line into
east London.
However, the Treasury has reservations about the quality of the offer made
by the administrators and Canary Wharf's banks to provide a contribution to
the Pounds 1.6bn costs of the line.
Mr Dennis believes the government has a debt of honour to the Canary Wharf
development.
He said: 'We went to the wall honouring our commitments to the government on
the project. Government agencies had difficulty meeting their commitments.
'One would hope that when it comes to deciding on the offer which the banks
and administrators have made to move Jubilee forward, all of that would be
taken into account.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Contractors hit by US recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH contractors, under severe pressure at home because of the recession,
won fewer overseas contracts last year, according to figures published
yesterday by the environment department.
The value of international construction orders won by British companies fell
by 11 per cent compared with 1990 to Pounds 2.2bn last year.
The biggest fall in orders was in North America where the value of contracts
fell by more than 30 per cent from Pounds 1.14bn to Pounds 781m. The decline
reflects the recession in US construction markets.
Overseas contracts account for less than 10 per cent of total order books of
British construction companies.
However last year contractors made big gains in the Far East, the world's
fastest-growing construction market. The value of Far Eastern contracts won
by British companies jumped by almost two thirds from Pounds 353m to Pounds
575m, in spite of a fall of Pounds 75m in Hong Kong.
Construction of Hong Kong's multi-billion pound Chek Lap Kok airport is
expected to provide big opportunities for UK construction companies over the
next few years. Costain, Trafalgar House and Amec have already won contracts
for a project that rivals the Channel tunnel in size.
British contractors also increased orders in the Middle East, once the
world's biggest export construction market, now greatly reduced in size. The
value of orders won by contractors rose to Pounds 245m last year from Pounds
200m in 1990.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
COOPERS &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, has been appointed to report on the
finances of the Church of England following criticism of the Church
Commissioners' investment performance.
The church asked Coopers to examine 'the commissioners' borrowings and the
information flow required for the management of their assets'.
Dr George Carey, who as archbishop of Canterbury is chairman of the
commissioners, promised the Church's general synod in July that there would
be an inquiry. He said 'serious points' had been made about the management
of funds and about judgments on investments.
The undertaking followed an article in the Financial Times in July which
said the commissioners, who are responsible for handling the church's main
assets, had suffered Pounds 500m losses on investments.
In their annual report for last year, the commissioners said that they
expected annual income to remain flat for some years and that it had 'become
urgent' to cut expenditure to match income forecasts.
One of the consequences is that church members have been told they will have
to meet a higher proportion of clergy stipends in future.
In the synod debate Sir Douglas Lovelock, first church estates commissioner
and chairman of the assets committee, defended the commissioners. He said
there was not an institution in the country whose capital value had not gone
down in the past year or two.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Heseltine urges drive
for exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE, the trade and industry secretary, said yesterday that
he intended to invite British companies to take part in a new and
challenging export drive this autumn, through seconding 100 of their staff
to his department to design, promote and lead the move.
'It has never been more urgent that we as a nation - public and private
sector together - strive for that tantalising prize of export-led growth
which has eluded us,' he said.
He also promised the launch this autumn of 15 'one-stop shops' as a step in
the DTI's efforts to make business advisory services more user-friendly.
The aim is to bring together services offered by local organisations such as
chambers of commerce and Training and Enterprise Councils into unified and
convenient advice centres.
The 15 'prototypes' will be chosen from proposals put to the the DTI, in a
way similar to the City Challenge process through which councils compete for
government funding. The aim is to extend the scheme to all major cities.
The first head of the DTI for several years to believe that government
should have an industrial strategy, Mr Heseltine unashamedly set out the
role of the department in supporting British companies through research and
development, training, regional grants and advisory services.
'We will endorse no moaner's charter, but where industry argues a good case
we will support them - in Whitehall, in Brussels - anywhere and everywhere
where it is proper for us to do so.'
His comments followed a very short debate in which, nonetheless, speakers
expressed heartfelt concern about the fate of Britain's manufacturing base.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Sale of BR unit to be
speeded up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MACGREGOR yest-erday signalled that the government will press ahead
faster than expected with the sale of Red Star, British Rail's lossmaking
express parcels service, as part of a six-point transport privatisation
programme.
In a speech which concluded with a ringing endorsement of the prime
minister's stance on Maastricht, the transport secretary also revealed that
London's buses would be privatised in 1993 and that the first round of
railway passenger franchises would be introduced a year later.
He remained tight-lipped on the future of the Jubilee Line, however,
commenting only that the government's spending ambitions had to be contained
'at a time when industry itself will suffer if public expenditure is not
kept within proper borrowing limits'.
Mr MacGregor told representatives that he had 'just' authorised the sale of
Red Star, which last year lost Pounds 12m on a turnover of Pounds 60m, and
hoped to have completed the disposal of BR's other freight and parcels
services before 1994 'once we have the legislative authority.'
The government expects to receive the first bids for Red Star at once and
anticipates concluding a deal next year. It can proceed to authorise a sale
without legislation since the unit is not part of BR's core business.
Claiming that the six-point programme resulted from popular demand, he said
the privatisation of London Buses would be followed by a deregulation bill.
In the year to March, London Buses collected Pounds 376m in fares but cost
Pounds 458m to run. Three years ago, it was split into 12 subsidiaries as a
prelude to privatisation.
Mr MacGregor said a consultation paper on the working of the franchising
system for railway passenger services would be published next week, with a
BR bill coming in November.
He said BR would 'not be able to bid for any franchise.' There had been
'sufficient enthusiasm to show that the first round of passenger franchises
will be successful'.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Smooth ride for the 'bus
candidate'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT takes the chutzpah of Mr Kenneth Clarke to boast of making a flat speech
to conference. But then it is the home secretary's easy confidence that is
proving one of the more interesting sideshows of the week in Brighton.
In a post-speech briefing yesterday he complimented the delegates for their
'more mature' attitude to the law and order debate - in the past a ritual
demonstration of Tory bloodlust.
'It was a serious and perfectly sensible debate and I'm glad about that,' he
said. 'It is the first time as far as I know that not a sole member of the
audience mentioned hanging or flogging - the Birmingham Six case has had its
effect.'
That frank appraisal came with the observation that law and order probably
was a more relevant issue to the public than all the Conservatives' public
hand-wringing about the Maastricht treaty.
Such calming sentiments are just one reason why Mr Clarke is increasingly
seen as the 'bus candidate' for the leadership - the man most likely to
succeed should Mr John Major disappear under a double-decker.
All week, indeed, all last week as well, it has been the ever-relaxed,
affably-voiced, suede-shoed home secretary who has appeared before the
cameras to bat aside the increasingly vituperative rhetoric of the
anti-Maastricht legions. He incurred their wrath on Tuesday by acknowledging
that he had not read the treaty and opining that probably few of his cabinet
colleagues had done so either.
While provoking paroxysms from the rebels, this very human - not to say
unpolitical - admission clearly appeals to the large element in the party
for whom life-and-death issues are both wearying and slightly improbable.
Yesterday, a similar, anti-hysterical tone pervaded Mr Clarke's law and
order speech. Britain was not any more lawless a country than its
neighbours, indeed, perhaps less so.
But he had identified a specific group of juvenile delinquent offenders who
were at the root of a huge quantity of crime. It was no good for them and no
good for us, he pragmatically observed, so he would do something about it.
Later, Mr Clarke was at it again, casually dismissing the imminent arrival
of Lady Thatcher as an amusing but rather irrelevant sideshow. 'We always
used to have our dust-ups in this great movement of ours,' he observed. 'It
was only Margaret who shut them down. What is new now is that we also have
the battle of the biographies.'
Cornered for a few remarks on his former employer, Mr Clarke happily
volunteered that he though it a bit rich that the woman who had brought
Britain into the exchange rate mechanism was now attacking it.
'Margaret saying 'I didn't mean to do it, I was bullied'' amounted to
'denying the history of her premiership', he said, laughing at the image of
Mr Major twisting the prime ministerial arm behind her back.
On the treaty itself, he merely observed: 'We will get it through . . with
difficulty.'
To some, the Clarke style of infinite reasonableness is irritating. But to
many others in what, after all, has often been called the non-political
party, it makes a refreshing change from the destructive ideological warfare
that the Thatcher epoch left in its wake.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Curtain up on a
guerrilla war - Conference Notebook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORGET Maastricht. It is the economy that counts.
For those with their eyes on Brighton, that will require a certain amount of
self-discipline. Lord Tebbit offered a vivid reminder this week that the
Tory party has still to catch up with Britain's distinctly modest place in
the world.
Lady Thatcher, who will join Mr John Major in a cruelly synthetic show of
solidarity on the Brighton platform this morning, will not be silenced. Her
unbridled assault on the exchange rate mechanism and on Maastricht in
today's issue of The European is nothing less than a direct attack on the
leadership of her successor.
It took more than two decades for the Conservatives to come grudgingly to
terms with the end of empire.
It is taking them longer still to realise that it is Britain rather than
Europe which is left isolated when fog descends upon the Channel.
So the emotional outpouring on the conference floor triggered by a cynically
brilliant speech from Essex Man (to be followed we can be sure by a similar
reception for Grantham Woman) foreshadows months of guerrilla warfare at
Westminster.
There will be a debate in principle on the legislation during the second
week after MPs return to the Commons on October 19. But senior ministers
have yet to decide whether Mr John Major can risk bringing the committee
stage forward before the Edinburgh summit.
Once detailed examination of the bill starts it will have to be taken 'on
the run', with all other legislative business pushed to one side for three
or four weeks. But during Britain's EC presidency, up to 10 ministers will
be abroad on any one day.
The prime minister has been told that his parliamentary business managers
can guarantee majorities against the wrecking tactics of the Tory
Euro-sceptics only if those ministers drop their presidency duties to stay
at Westminster.
So the committee stage might yet be deferred until the new year, leaving the
divisions to fester throughout the autumn. Royal Assent may in the end rely
on Labour abstentions.
But the important point is that no one - Lord Tebbit no more than Mr Douglas
Hurd - doubts that the government has the capacity to ratify Maastricht. At
the end of the day Conservative heads will rule Tory hearts.
The economy offers no such certainty.
Those expecting Mr Norman Lamont to conjure from a magic box a blueprint for
a totally new economic policy will be disappointed. Life outside the ERM is
not that simple.
The chancellor will set out the parameters of a strategy, which will be
familiar to anyone who watched the then Mr Nigel Lawson struggle to frame
his policy during the mid 1980s.
The starting point is that the objective of consistently low inflation has
not changed. The delivery mechanism will be tight control of public spending
 -if it can, the Treasury will undershoot its Pounds 244.5bn target for next
year - and a mix of monetary indicators to determine interest rates.
The value of the pound will, as Mr Lawson used to say, be 'taken into
account'. Sticking to the public spending targets, which are much tougher in
the two succeeding years than in 1993-94, should allow modest reductions in
income tax in the approach to the next election.
There will be a confirmation that house prices are to join MO and M3 in the
Treasury's list of monetary indicators. But the chancellor will not risk
sending his audience to sleep with a detailed tour around the motorways of
the money supply. Nigel Lawson tried that once in the early 1980s. It left
his audience glued to their seats.
Mr Lamont's first priority is to demonstrate that he still deserves to
retain the keys to No 11 Downing Street - first to his audience in Brighton
and through their acclaim to the financial markets. But for many colleagues
his speech - and the more detailed exposition which will follow at the House
of Commons next week - will be no more than a staging post. They want
sterling back in the ERM - not this month or next but within perhaps a year.
One of the most striking things this week has been how the conference has
reinforced the natural authority of the troika of enthusiastic Europeans at
the top of the cabinet.
Mr Hurd saw off the Euro-sceptics in a brilliant speech. Mr Michael
Heseltine did likewise in typically more flamboyant style. Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the heir apparent if Mr Major were to suffer a nasty traffic
accident, has added a layer of prime ministerial gravitas to his robust
political style.
These ministers have not been singing in their baths. Instead they have
given every sign that they are concerned that the pound may go into free
fall.
They see no reason to fight the ERM battle now. They acknowledge the
difficulties posed by Maastricht. They also see the economic case for
caution about the timing of re-entry.
Next spring or summer seems a more realistic bet. So for the moment Messrs
Hurd Heseltine and Clarke echo Mr Lamont's formula that sterling will float
for the 'foreseeable future'. But the ghost of the ERM has not been banished
from the cabinet table.

the argument proclaimed the treaty's virtues in conference proceedings again
dominated by Europe.
The chancellor of the exchequer and the trade and industry secretary
insisted the treaty was a victory for Britain and a turning-point in pushing
back the tide of European centralisation and the danger of federalism.
Reminding his audience of the concessions made by other EC countries during
the negotiations, Mr Lamont emphasised that the treaty not only included
'subsidiarity' or minimum interference in the work of national governments
by the European Commission, but also spelt out the areas which should be
dealt with through co-operation between governments, such as home and
foreign affairs.
In a wide-ranging speech to the Conservative Political Centre on the future
of Europe, the chancellor said the EC should be a 'community of nations' not
a 'superstate'. While there was widespread support for defending Britain's
independence in Europe, he saw no similar legitimacy for a European
government.
'At present I do not believe that there is a European identity of anything
like the quality and strength of the several national identities that exist
within the Community,' he said, though he warned that perpetual vigilance
was needed against the Community's tendency to centralise.
He admitted that, with the extension of qualified majority voting to
single-market issues under the single European act, some British sovereignty
had been ceded, but said that those restrictions were 'as nothing' set
against the benefits of the single market.
Nonetheless, there had to be a clear limit on what was suitable for
Community action. 'The main decisions concerning economic and fiscal policy
 -in particular taxation and government spending - must remain the
responsibilities of member states,' he said.
While dutifully adhering to the agreed cabinet position, he attacked
'petty-minded orders' that made the Commission a laughing stock. 'Those
things for which we want Europe to work together - such as free trade, fair
competition and prosperity - can be achieved by nation states within a
community . . and do not require the creation of a superstate,' he said.
It was 'totally inconsistent' for the Commission to call for more funding
from member states 'while at the same time preaching about the need to
reduce budget deficits.'
Earlier, in the main conference hall, Mr Heseltine faced down some rowdy
Euro-sceptic interventions in a performance that won him a standing ovation
during his speech as well as at its end.
He insisted that Mr John Major had gone to Maastricht 'to fight for our
essential interests'.
'And lost]' came a shout from the floor.
Mr Heseltine argued passionately that 'national self-interest' was the only
convincing reason for membership of the EC, and warned that if Britain were
left on the periphery of Europe, the future of the City of London and the
stream of inward investment from Japan and America would be at risk.
Mr Peter Lilley, a cabinet Euro-sceptic, said: 'We British have governed
ourselves for 1,000 years. Our laws, institutions and sovereign parliament
are the essence of our nationhood. And nationhood is the precondition of
democracy. That nationhood will not be extinguished. We won't let federalism
erode it away. We won't let Brussels take it away.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Lilley signals financial curbs on social security
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CLEAR signal that the social security department will become a casualty of
fierce Treasury curbs on public spending, which might yet see it reneging on
Conservative manifesto commitments, was given yesterday by Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary.
To escape the recession, 'we must curb public spending, including social
security', Mr Lilley told the Conservative conference.
Talking later to journalists, he refused even to reaffirm the Tories
election pledge to uprate child benefit in line with inflation, or discuss
possible hikes in the National Insurance contributions ceiling. 'I'm not
going to respond to specific items,' he insisted.
Mr Lilley is understood to be fighting the Treasury hard to avoid
overturning election promises, but a number of other cuts are fast becoming
probabilities.
These include reducing the period during which the jobless are entitled to
unemployment benefit from 12 months to six, although resulting savings would
be offset partially by higher Income Support payments. Housing benefit and
disability allowances could also be hit.
With discussions still continuing, the Treasury may still succeed in
imposing stronger control over the social security department's Pounds 70bn
budget. Legislation to end the statutory uprating of state pensions - which
will be based on September's inflation figure released tomorrow - is being
actively canvassed by the Treasury.
In a speech geared largely at playing to the instincts of many of the Tory
representatives, Mr Lilley promised renewed efforts to clamp down on social
security fraud, setting a target of Pounds 500m in savings this year and
hinting at a higher target for next year. 'I'm closing down the
something-for-nothing society,' he declared.
He singled out 'councillors who draw the dole to run leftwing campaigns' and
'young ladies who get pregnant just to jump the housing queue' as being on
his 'little list of benefit offenders who I'll soon be rooting out'.
Hinting that he is anxious to see greater targeting of benefits, Mr Lilley
said that 'improving benefits is not just a question of spending more money.
It's how we spend it that counts.'
But, while he wanted to focus benefits on the most needy, he wished also to
restore incentives to work which would limit the extent to which further
'means-testing' could be introduced. Other priorities included simplifying
the benefits system and encouraging personal responsibility. He stressed the
importance of absent parents contributing to the upkeep of their children.
He also announced the setting up of a new 'family credit' advice line.
Mr Lilley said the helpline would mean that, for the first time, a benefits
advice service would be available to potential claimants as well as those
already claiming family credit.
He also underlined his previous announcement of tougher rules affecting
so-called New Age Travellers.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Thatcher scorns
'ruinous' treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'ruinous' Maastricht treaty and the 'unbearable' exchange rate mechanism
should be abandoned in favour of an economic policy that 'puts British needs
first', Lady Thatcher declares today in an unrestrained broadside on the
government.
Britain requires 'an economic strategy which works with markets, not against
them, is realistic and sustainable, and provides a framework for growth,'
Lady Thatcher says in The European newspaper. She calls for a return to the
policy of domestic monetary control that 'worked throughout most of the
1980s'.
'The ERM and Maastricht are inextricably linked,' the former prime minister
writes. 'The first is a prerequisite to the fulfilment of the second. We
found the confines of the first unbearable; the straitjacket of the second
would be ruinous.' The two were 'part of the vision of yesterday'.
She says the government should have left the ERM 'once we realised (it)
lacked the flexibility we expected and required.' Instead, 'we were forced
to keep up interest rates even though our recession at home was signalling
the need to reduce them'.
Homeowners and businessmen had 'paid a heavy price', she said, but 'at least
now we have the freedom to put those problems right'.
The Maastricht treaty's goal of European economic and monetary union looked
'even more impossible'. She would not regret a 'two-tier Europe', but said
the Maastricht economies might find themselves, not Britain, in the 'slow
lane' to economic growth.

FT  08 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party at Brighton: Patten vows to end NUS
'closed shop'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUTOMATIC membership of the National Union of Students will end soon, Mr
John Patten, education secretary, promised in a speech to the conference
yesterday.
He said only a few students became involved in supporting 'dubious causes'
through the NUS. 'In a free country, that is their privilege,' he said. 'But
why should the taxpayer have to pay for it?' NUS subscriptions are paid
automatically for most students by local authorities.
'We have abolished the closed shop everywhere else. There is no reason why
it should linger on in our universities and colleges,' he said. 'The NUS
closed shop must go. It must go soon, and go it will.'
The announcement was met with roars of approval from the hall.
The NUS, which has an annual income of about Pounds 2m from affiliation
fees, rejected Mr Patten's 'closed shop' claim. 'We are more like the
Confederation of British industry than a traditional trade union,' it said.
'We represent students' interests at national level and provide a range of
services such as welfare officers counselling people with financial and
accommodation problems.'
Mr Patten's speech concentrated on the familiar themes of choice, diversity
and standards, praising the achievements of grant-maintained schools in
England and Wales.
'I want to see all schools going grant-maintained,' he said. 'That's local
accountability and devolution of power to the people at its best.'
Several speakers complained that schools thinking of opting out often met
discouragement and disinformation from Labour-controlled local authorities.
It would be a government priority to 'sweep away the barriers erected
against schools who want to opt out', Mr Patten said.
'Shamefully, some local education authorities continue to squander your
money on trying to discourage parents from balloting. This abuse of public
funds has got to stop.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Volatility 'unhelpful' says food chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERIC NICOLI, chairman of United Biscuits, is more concerned about where
sterling will be tomorrow than where it stands today. 'The volatility is
extremely unhelpful,' he says.
Until last month, his company's main concern about foreign currency exposure
was to prevent the weakness of the dollar magnifying the impact of a steep
slide in profits at Keebler, its US biscuits and snacks subsidiary.
UB is still struggling to restore Keebler's fortunes, but at least it has
stopped worrying about the dollar. Mr Nicoli says a series of foreign
exchange options taken out by the company at rates a little above Dollars
1.70 to the pound are being quietly allowed to expire.
Cadbury Schweppes, which has sizeable soft drinks sales in the US, had also
come to regard the dollar as its main source of foreign exchange risk. 'Now
we are treating all currencies as foreign,' says Mr David Jinks, finance
director.
He says Cadbury will benefit slightly from devaluation. He has revised his
forecast of the adverse financial impact of currency fluctuations on the
company from 4.5 per cent to about 1.5 per cent over the full year.
He says the company, which exports about Pounds 40m worth of confectionery
every year, will peg prices.
Mr Nicoli does not expect sterling's decline to have a big impact on United
Biscuits in the short-term, but is unsure whether the gains outweigh the
losses. 'You'd have to do the calculations twice a day to give an answer.'
Both companies expanded internationally in the 1980s, with a particular
priority on continental Europe, and their sterling results will be flattered
by income from acquisitions in countries in the European Monetary System.
The companies are reasonably sanguine about the immediate effects of
devaluation in input costs in the UK. The main consequence so far has been
in downward adjustments by the EC to the value of the 'green' pound - the
rate at which EC farm prices are expressed in sterling - which has increased
the sterling price of sugar.
Mr Nicoli is more cautious about prospects in the longer term. He says:
'Depending on how low the sterling exchange rate goes and how long it lasts,
there is bound to be some adverse impact on our raw materials costs.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / 'Good news' for darts maker: Leisure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDDIE and Peter Norman annually notch up more than Pounds 1m in worldwide
sales of darts and dartboards. They intend to use the fall in sterling to
improve their score.
Business was already buoyant for the Bristol-based House of Darts, which
sells 98 per cent of its product overseas and recently found itself starring
in a Christmas speech by the Queen for its exporting prowess.
But the cheaper pound has given a noticeable boost to orders from
wholesalers in some of the company's biggest European markets: 'It is good
news and we are going to make the best of it,' says Mr Eddie Norman. Sales
in Germany have been 'shooting up'.
He is not so sure, however, that the price advantage of buying British is
being passed on to customers, with many wholesalers themselves pocketing
improved margins. Even so, that prospect alone should encourage wholesalers
to push the British company's products.
'Our best markets have been thriving in any case,' Mr Norman says. 'But we
will try and use the cheaper pound to step up sales in those countries where
breaking into the market has been more difficult or where opportunities are
now opening up. France is the tough one and we have been stepping up efforts
to crack it. The fall in sterling should help back up our sales effort.'
One problem is the difficulty which some overseas customers claim they are
having in promptly paying their invoices from House of Darts.
According to Mr Norman, 'we have had customers in Denmark and Finland saying
they cannot pay on time because their banks won't sell them sterling. That
sort of confusion we can do without.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Salesmen pound the continental pavements: Machine tools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALESMEN from Bridgeport Machines, the Leicester-based machine-tool maker,
are already pounding the pavements of the Continent to exploit a cheaper
pound in promoting their products.
'People have left for Germany today to try and cash in on our lower prices,'
said Mr Malcolm Taylor, managing director of Bridgeport. 'We are also
sending to Italy, though they seem to be more or less in the same boat as
us.'
The company, whose annual sales are running at around Pounds 30m - half the
level recorded in 1990 - exports about 60 per cent of all its machinery.
Thirty-five per cent of all sales go to continental Europe.
According to Mr Taylor: 'The market is very price-sensitive in recession and
the fall of sterling makes an important difference on a machine costing up
to Pounds 70,000. We are out there today, aggressively exploiting the
situation'.
Mr Taylor acknowledges that imports of German and Japanese technology used
by his business will cost more, but says the overall impact of sterling's
decline is beneficial.
'We have got to where we wanted to be by default. When the pound was higher,
we were struggling to sell. Now there are far more opportunities and we are
getting back into deals which were previously aborted on price grounds'.
Bridgeport is playing the cheaper pound for all it is worth. Salesmen are at
the Leipzig machine tool show, supporting the company's German agent and
pressing home the advantage of lower prices.
Poor sales at the Chicago show revived towards its close because of the
falling pound.
'We had almost lost the US market at nearly two dollars to the pound. But we
are back to reality and the impact has been immediate'. All Bridgeport wants
now is the restoration of some stability to the exchange rate.

RETAILERS who are supplied from outside the UK face serious problems from
currency fluctuations, particularly in the fashion sector.
The cautious will have taken steps to protect themselves by taking out
currency cover. 'We are not currency speculators . . . but a lot of people
will have taken a certain amount of cover,' says one high-street retailer.
Next, the fashion retailing group, has tried to be even more cautious by
progressively scaling back on its overseas sourcing in the past two years.
Mr David Jones, Next's chief executive, says the currency fluctuation had
produced 'an added impetus' to source more from within the UK. 'We were
sourcing almost 40 per cent from the UK,' he continued. 'But it's now about
50 per cent the UK and 50 per cent abroad, of which European countries -
Italy, Portugal and Spain - are becoming more important.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK is 'less attractive' destination for German waste: Paper
recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECLINE of sterling has come as welcome news to at least one part of
British industry - the companies that collect and recycle waste paper.
The relative rise in the value of the D-Mark is expected to help staunch the
inflow of German material from recycled cardboard boxes which has been
playing havoc with the pricing structure of the UK market.
But Mr Peter Williams, chief executive of the David S. Smith paper and
packaging group, believes the pound's fall against other European currencies
is likely to bring only temporary respite to his industry.
'The devaluation has relieved some of the competitive pressures, making it
less attractive for continental Europeans to ship here,' he says. 'It will
help attenuate our problems, but it will not solve them.'
Spurred on by a big national recycling scheme, the German paper packaging
industry has benefited from an unlimited supply of cheap raw materials. But
surplus collected materials have moved out of Germany, driving down prices
across Europe and undermining the market economics of paper recycling
industries in other countries. 'The fundamental problem remains that many
continental European countries have state-driven mandated recycling systems
whereas we have a market-based system which is vulnerable to price
pressures,' Mr Williams says.
The Italian waste paper collection and recycling industries, which have been
similarly hit by the glut of German materials over the past year, are also
likely to experience some temporary relief following the lira's decline
against other currencies.
However, UK companies which buy recycled paper to convert into cardboard
boxes are likely to face increased cost pressures as a result of sterling's
decline.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Effect on GKN 'is pretty small': Vehicle components
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID LEES observes the slide of sterling with a certain detachment.
Ten years ago, GKN, the automotive components, engineering and industrial
services group of which he is chairman, earned two thirds of its revenues
from UK plants. Relish at the prospect of a short-term exports boom would
have been tempered by higher import costs and inflation.
Now, having pursued a 'globalisation' policy since the early 1980s, Sir
David says GKN is barely affected in trading terms. 'Because of
globalisation we are supplying our customers out of the same countries in
which they have their own plants, so the effect of devaluation is pretty
small.
'The very reason we globalised is that we could no longer risk the problems
of this type of fluctuation.'
As a result, says Sir David, GKN feels no need to make abrupt policy shifts
to take account of the weaker pound.
Out of GKN's total Pounds 1.95bn sales last year, only Pounds 649m was in
the UK, with Pounds 815m in continental Europe, Pounds 354m in the Americas
and Pounds 107m in the rest of the world.
Sir David sees a few potential benefits. There is the prospect of profits
made in Germany being worth more in sterling terms. 'But . . . the scope is
no longer there for GKN to obtain any great advantage from devaluation'.
There is one sizeable exception: GKN holds a 40 per cent stake in United
Engineering Steels, which will benefit substantially from the fact that
steel in Europe is primarily priced in D-Marks.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Builders already on paper-thin margins: Construction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of building in Britain could rise by between 1 per cent and 2 per
cent as a result of the devaluation of the pound, according to EC Harris, an
international construction cost consultant.
Imports account for about Pounds 4bn of annual building material sales of
Pounds 32bn. Britain ran a trade deficit of almost Pounds 1.8bn in building
materials during the 12 months to the end of June - almost 16 per cent of
the country's Pounds 11.25bn visible trade gap during the period.
A 10 per cent devaluation of sterling would increase the annual building
materials import bill by Pounds 400m, adding about 1.25 per cent to
contractors' costs.
Mr Martin Laing, chairman of John Laing, a UK contractor with annual sales
of more than Pounds 1bn, says sterling's devaluation would increase pressure
on prices of basic commodities such as timber and oil-based goods not
produced in the UK.
But competition in depressed UK and overseas construction markets might
restrict price rises in the short term, he adds.
EC Harris says contractors working on long-term fixed-price contracts would
suffer from higher material or labour costs. Many were already working on
paper-thin or non-existent margins.
Timber - much of it tropical hardwoods - accounts for more than Pounds 1bn
of the annual trade deficit in materials, according to the environment
department. Copper products amount to a further Pounds 100m.
There is also a substantial deficit in manufactured goods, with imports of
ironmongery exceeding exports by almost Pounds 200m.

FT  08 OCT 92 / No regrets over launch of VW dealership: New cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR HARALD PETERS and his two fellow directors have chosen the middle of the
steepest post-war recession in the UK's new car market to open a car
dealership on which they have spent 'several million' pounds.
The franchise for the dealership, in Stockwell, south-west London, is
Volkswagen/Audi. Mr Peters and his colleagues are now anxious to see just
what Germany's largest carmaker intends to do about a sterling devaluation
which could make Volkswagen and Audi cars substantially more expensive in
the UK.
Mr Peters, however, says he has not the slightest regrets about opening the
dealership - the group's second - and expresses confidence that the
manufacturer will not pass on any heavy rises in cars or parts.
'I believe it is possible that Volkswagen will introduce the level of
increase we normally see at the start of each year, of 2 per cent to 3 per
cent. But, if they made an increase of 10 per cent, we would have no chance
whatsoever to compete with British or even other continental manufacturers.'
Mr Peters' relative confidence about the size of any increases - in spite of
warnings from BMW that UK prices might have to rise substantially in the New
Year - is based on his belief that Volkswagen/Audi is intent on gaining a
larger market share in the UK and that it will not take any action which
might undermine this as a long-term strategy.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Hotels chief welcomes 'bargain Britain': Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LURE of the UK as a holiday destination for foreign tourists has been
boosted by the slide of sterling against other European currencies.
'It's getting cheap now to come to the UK for a holiday, cheaper almost than
anywhere else in Europe,' says Mr John Bairstow, chairman of Queens Moat
Houses. The group has 86 hotels in continental Europe and 103 in the UK, and
mainly targets the business executive and conference market.
Mr Bairstow predicted in August that the UK side of the business would
progressively become just one of the major areas of operation 'rather than
the mainstay of the business'.
The fluctuation in exchange rates has, if anything, given impetus to that
transfer of status. Mr Bairstow explains: 'Trading over in Germany and the
Benelux countries is very high indeed compared to the UK, where it is still
very flat. If devaluation is by 20 per cent, where effectively it looks as
though it may settle, then it will increase our continental earnings and
asset values by 20 per cent on a repatriated basis.'
In the first half of this year, UK operating profits for Queens Moat Houses
were up by 6.6 per cent over last year to Pounds 38.7m.
But the rise in Germany was 37 per cent to Pounds 23.1m; 22 per cent to
Pounds 12.9m in the Benelux countries, and 26 per cent to Pounds 2.9m in
France.
While Mr Bairstow's continental holdings are doing better, a relative fall
in the value of sterling also augurs well for the UK hotels. He says there
is a lack of tourists from the Continent in the early part of the year
because it was cheaper for them to stay at home.
'The UK became an expensive holiday place,' Mr Bairstow says. 'We have here
in the UK all the infrastructure to cater for people, but what we didn't
have was the exchange rate which made it worthwhile for people to come.'
British hotels may now be relatively cheap, but they have to offer a high
quality of service to satisfy continental visitors. 'I don't think the UK
hotel industry is ever going to be the same again,' Mr Bairstow comments.
'The demand for higher-quality facilities is growing, and when people come
back into the UK hotel business I think they are going to be much more
demanding.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATION of the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) was formally
concluded in San Antonio, Texas, yesterday with a symbolic initialling by
Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Jaime Serra Puche, Mexico's
commerce secretary, and Mr Michael Wilson, Canada's trade and industry
minister, Our Foreign Staff reports.
They were flanked by the leaders of their respective countries. The
initialling must still be followed by formal signing and ratified by each
nation's legislatures. President Bush hopes the treaty will boost his
electoral chances, especially in states thought to gain from extra
US-Mexican trade, hence the choice of Texas for the initialling.
However the conditional support of Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic
presidential candidate, for the treaty is likely to reduce, if not
eliminate, any such advantage.
An opinion poll by the Mexican Institute of Public Opinion showed 48 per
cent of Mexicans asked supported Nafta, down from previous estimates by
other organisations.

FT  08 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Trieste must wait to relive old glory -
Hopes of an economic renaissance have been unfulfilled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are today some remarkably glum faces in Trieste, the Italian port city
which three years ago thought of itself on the brink of an economic
renaissance.
Once the port and commercial centre of the Austro-Hungarian empire, many
locals believed Trieste would relive its former glories with the political
and economic liberalisation of eastern Europe that was expected to follow
the fall of the Berlin wall.
Even before that, Trieste was reasserting its historical function as a
trading centre. On an average Saturday, it would be filled with cars from
the former Yugoslavia - and even more distant east European countries -
crammed with shoppers after scarce food and consumer goods.
While much of the trade was local and for private consumption, the volumes
were immense, recalls Mr Pier Giorgio Luccarini, chairman of Cassa di
Risparmio di Trieste, the city's savings bank. 'Trieste used to be invaded
by Yugoslavs. Rather than just buying one or two pairs of jeans, they would
buy 20, keep two and resell the rest.' The local chamber of commerce reckons
cross-border business helped to support a disproportionately large retail
sector for a city of 230,000.
Such flows fostered views that Trieste, isolated from the rest of Italy and
vulnerable economically after losing its 'hinterland' of Istria and Dalmatia
to Yugoslavia after 1945, was set for an economic boom. 'There was a mood
which was irrational and sentimental for the past,' admits Mr Giulio
Staffieri, Trieste's mayor.
Instead, Trieste's economy has plunged into recession, with rising
unemployment and a sharp increase in insolvencies. Retail sales alone have
sunk by 40 per cent since hostilities broke out in the former Yugoslavia,
the chamber of commerce reckons. Political turmoil in Yugoslavia put an
immediate break on trade. While business has picked up since independence in
Slovenia, Trieste's immediate neighbour, in mid-1991, commerce with other
ex-Yugoslavian states remains depressed.
Economic difficulties have also affected Hungary and the Czech and Slovak
republics, says Mr Luccarini. 'Travel may be easier now than three years
ago, but many Hungarians and Czechs have less money to spend than they did
under communism.' While commerce and services, on which the city's economy
is based, have suffered badly, it has also been hit by the recession in the
heavy, public-sector, industries which account for thousands of jobs.
The former Ilva steelworks are in receivership after a failed privatisation
attempt, the local ship repair yards are in crisis because of overcapacity
in the Adriatic, while the state-owned Grandi Motori marine propulsion group
is suffering from a shortage of orders. Even the publicly-owned port,
Italy's second biggest, is in loss.
Though wealthy, the city has one of Italy's oldest populations, while its
birth rate is among the lowest. The population has been shrinking steadily
for 20 years. Poor transport links with neighbouring east European countries
have also impeded trade, says Prof Giacomo Borruso, rector of Trieste
University and an expert on transport economics. New road and rail links are
on the drawing board, but completion is still a long way off.
'What is missing in Trieste is entrepreneurship,' says Mr Staffieri. 'We
need people who will set up new businesses and take advantage of the
opportunities for trade with the east that will eventually arise.'
Despite the difficulties, local businessmen have taken some initiatives.
Eyebrows were raised last December when the savings bank opened a branch in
the Slovenian port of Koper, across the bay. 'No one could understand why,'
says Mr Luccarini. 'But this is our obvious catchment area. Where else can
we find new business?' Heartened by its success, he has just bought a small
bank in Croatia.
The family-owned Illy coffee group, one of Italy's biggest, is planning to
open a factory in Slovenia. Generali, Italy's biggest insurer company and
Trieste's best-known company, has been returning to its central European
roots with a string of deals in Hungary and Romania. 'When the Berlin Wall
fell, we felt we were on the verge of a new beginning,' says Prof Borruso.
'Now we realise it's going to take much longer.'

tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government yesterday approved a draft customs law which, if it
is approved by parliament later this month, will impose tariffs of up to 15
per cent on imports and up to 30 per cent on certain sensitive exports.
Mr Alexei Ulyukayev, a senior government adviser, described the draft
customs law as an effort 'to defend certain branches of our domestic
industry' and as retaliation against North American and Western European
anti-dumping laws which he said had hurt Russian exporters.
It may also represent an effort by Mr Piotr Avens, Russia's reformist
minister of foreign economic relations, to defend himself against the biting
attack of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, who on Tuesday accused Mr
Avens of 'lack of firmness and consistency in defending Russia's interests'.
The draft law proposes import tariffs of 15 per cent on finished goods and 5
per cent on parts and raw materials. No tariffs are to be levied on foods
and medicines on the grounds that these goods are in desperately short
supply in Russia.
Under the old Soviet system, quotas were used to restrict exports.
Under the draft law, quotas will apply only to oil, oil products, precious
metals and gas, which are heavily subsidised in Russia. In their stead, the
draft proposes that exporters pay a tariff of between 20 and 35 per cent of
the world price of the goods they are selling abroad.
To enforce the law Mr Anatoli Kruglov, head of the State Customs Committee,
told the official news agency Tass that he hopes to double Russia's current
300 customs posts.
Mr Ulyukayev said that Russia is forming a customs union with Belarus and
Kazakhstan, the most pro-Russian of the former Soviet republics, but that
customs posts would be erected on Russia's borders with Ukraine, the Baltic
republics and with the Caucasus region.
He said Russia was particularly disturbed by the smuggling of roubles from
the Baltic republics, where they are no longer legal tender.
According to the Tass news agency, approximately Rbs750m in cash have been
smuggled into Russia from Latvia and Lithuania since those republics de
facto adopted their own currencies.

<TEXT>
GEC ALSTHOM Engineering Systems, part of the Anglo-French engineering group,
has won an important contract from Paks Nuclear Power Plant of Hungary for a
proposed spent nuclear fuel store at its 1,760MW nuclear power plant.
The contract will provide a spent fuel store for all four of Hungary's
VVER-type pressurised water reactors.
Before the Soviet Union collapsed, it supplied fuel to VVER-type reactors in
eastern Europe, pledging to take the spent fuel back. But Russia will no
longer do this, making east European countries find an alternative to
switching the plants off. The system chosen is GEC Alsthom's modular vault
dry store system, approved in the US to store a wide range of spent fuel
types and in service at a Colorado gas-cooled reactor plant.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE intense efforts to lower hopes before this weekend's EC-US talks on
a Gatt trade agreement, officials in Brussels said yesterday the meetings
represent the best shot at a breakthrough in recent memory.
But the same EC officials cautioned that narrowing differences on the
outstanding issues in agriculture, services and market access remained
fraught with difficulty.
Concern exists, too, on how to present a potential breakthrough in public. A
premature declaration of victory by a beleaguered President Bush or an
over-eager UK Presidency of the EC could generate a backlash, either among
the Democratic majority in Congress or in Paris, where the French government
has warned of the risks of a Gatt 'sell-out'.
The talks, starting in Brussels on Sunday, are surrounded by extraordinary
secrecy. The European Commission could not reveal yesterday where they will
be held, nor how long they will last, only that they may stretch into
Monday.
Involved are Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs commissioner, Mrs
Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC farm
commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary.
The biggest obstacles on agriculture are how far payments to EC farmers in
compensation for big price cuts agreed in the recent Common Agricultural
Policy reform should be exempt from progressive cuts under the Uruguay Round
'final act'; and how far the EC must cut the volume of its subsidised farm
exports, and the amount of subsidy.
Mr Andriessen and Mrs Hills will cover services and market access or
'tariffication'. Later, they may join Mr McSharry and Mr Madigan in four-way
talks. The original impetus for the talks came from President Bush who
sought them in a letter to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission. One theory is that Mr Bush, who trails Governor Bill Clinton,
his Democratic opponent in all the recent polls, views a Gatt deal and its
promise of a world economy revival as his secret weapon.
Officials also said EC leaders could endorse progress in the talks at the
Birmingham summit on October 16, letting Mr Bush and European leaders
declare, credibly, their belief that a detailed deal could be reached by the
end of the year - in time for the March 1993 deadline for expiry of the
administration's 'fast-track' trade negotiating authority.

A proposed ADollars 2bn (Pounds 800m) private power station in Western
Australia is in jeopardy after the state government indicated it would not
accept electricity prices proposed by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the
Swiss/Swedish engineering group, Kevin Brown reports from Sydney.
ABB was commissioned in June by the West Australia State Energy Commission
(SEC) to build and run Australia's first privately-owned and
privately-funded power station at Collie, in the south-west of the state.
But the project depends on final agreement between ABB and the SEC on
several issues, including pricing and government financial support for
associated debt.
Mrs Carmen Lawrence, Labor premier, has told the SEC the government would
reject any contract with ABB raising energy prices or expose the state to
commercial risk. ABB plans to finance the project largely through a bonds
issue, but ABB has sought state guarantees for some of the proposed debt.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Clinton flares up under fire on TV and keeps his big lead in
the polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton showed his temper yesterday. He was undoubtedly
provoked, his anger did not last long, and the display of it won him a round
of applause.
However, with all political attention in the US zeroing in on the first of
the televised debates by the main candidates, due next Sunday, any variant
in the confident mood of the front-runner in the presidential election
assumes disproportionate significance.
President George Bush's supporters are beginning to hope that a seam of
weakness might have been discovered in their Democratic opponent at last.
Mr Clinton had been pressed by Mr Phil Donahue, the TV talk show host, on
the latest Republican attempts to discredit his character.
These are mostly disseminated, without substantiation, by the
ultra-conservative Washington Times newspaper, and are that Mr Clinton
attended several meetings, in the US and Europe, of the anti-Vietnam war
movement more than 20 years ago, that he once considered renouncing his US
citizenship and, most darkly, the implication that he might have been
suborned during a visit to the communist Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia
early in 1970.
Mr Donahue said it was clear Mr Clinton had been 'more active' in the
anti-war movement than he had previously let on, and that 'we are right to
ask these questions because we wonder what kind of leadership you would
bring to the Oval Office.'
'You are wrong to ignore my entire public life,' Mr Clinton brusquely
responded, 'which you and a lot of other people have done, and to make up
your own characterisation on this so that you can once again divert people
from a discussion of the things that will affect their lives.' The studio
audience, sympathetic to Mr Clinton, erupted in cheering.
The incident is probably trivial in itself and did the Democratic candidate
no immediate harm. But it may serve as a sort of trailer for the debates
themselves and the extent to which Mr Bush will seek to change the subject
from the state of the national economy to his opponent's character.
Mr Clinton has shown testiness before in the long campaign - as has Mr Bush.
Mr Ross Perot, the third presidential candidate at the debating table, is
permanently testy under questioning. The independent from Texas prefers, as
he did in his first paid TV commercial on Tuesday night, to lecture
audiences on what is wrong with the country.
More polls yesterday confirmed the impression that only a radical change of
mind by the electorate, which could be induced by some egregious mistake in
the debates, can stop Mr Clinton winning the presidency.
A national opinion survey for The Los Angeles Times has given him 48 per
cent, Mr Bush 34 per cent and Mr Perot nine per cent, while the latest NBC
poll's split was 46:32:10.
Among new state polls, Mr Clinton was 20 percentage points ahead in
California, 18 in Pennsylvania, 16 in New Jersey, and 13 in North Carolina.
The Bush campaign seems to have written off California but the other three
states are very important if the president is to be re-elected.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Brazilian call for ministry: Privatisation in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S former privatisation chief said yesterday his country needed a
privatisation minister to speed up the selling of state-owned companies.
Mr Eduardo Modiano, who resigned last week as head of the National
Development Bank after the change of government in Brazil, told a Financial
Times conference that only a minister would have the necessary influence to
push through the necessary restructuring of companies to prepare them for
privatisation.
Mr Modiano, who reported to the economy minister while in office, said
delays had ensued from the slowness of some restructurings.
He favoured a Mexican-style process by which companies, once up for sale,
would be transferred to the privatisation ministry, which would then carry
out necessary restructuring.
He told the conference, on privatisation in Latin America, that he expected
the new Brazilian government of interim president Itamar Franco to continue
the privatisation schedule for the next few months.
Thirteen companies are for sale before the end of January, with a total
33,355 employees and a total minimum price equivalent to Dollars 2.68bn,
payable in government debt. This would double the combined size of the
companies privatised so far.
He expected that two steel companies would provide the greatest test for the
programme: Acesita, based in Minas Gerais, with 8,000 employees and a
Dollars 352m minimum price, due for auction on October 22; and CSN, a
Dollars 1.45bn company with 18,000 employees, based in Rio de Janeiro state.
In Argentina, the government has plans to float 40 companies by the end of
1993, Mr Juan Carlos Sanchez Arnau, under-secretary for privatisation, told
the conference.
Afterwards, he acknowledged flaws in the sale to the public this year of
Telecom, one of the country's two privatised telephone companies.
The shares have fallen sharply from the offer price, possibly damaging the
appetite of individual investors for future privatisations. Part of the
problem was that many investors took 100 per cent financing from banks to
buy the shares, then were in trouble after the share price collapsed.
He said the Dutch auction system used to price the shares had resulted in
too high a price, which was further inflated by allowing banks to finance
the purchases. 'It won't happen again,' he said.

<TEXT>
REGISTRATION for Peru's congressional elections will close at midnight
tonight, three prominent parties having decided not to field candidates.
Peruvians will vote on November 22 for a new, 80-member 'democratic
constituent congress'.
President Alberto Fujimori is hoping for a majority so as to continue
economic liberalisation and structural reform. Also, the resumption of
much-needed international financial assistance to Peru, frozen since the
president dissolved the previous Congress and suspended the constitution on
April 5, depends on a return to democracy.
The parties not fielding candidates argue that the new Congress, charged
with writing a new constitution, already has its hands tied by Mr Fujimori.
Opposition to the his regime by former presidents Fernando Belaunde and Alan
Garca has ensured that their parties, Popular Action and Apra respectively,
will not run.
The right-wing Freedom movement of Mr Mario Vargas Llosa, defeated by Mr
Fujimori in the last presidentiual election, has also refused to
participate.
Up to a dozen groups, many of them newcomers to Peruvian politics, could
meet the deadline tonight.
Parties which failed to gain at least five per cent of the popular vote in
the 1990 elections, and so do not qualify for registration, have had to
collect signatures from at least 100,000 backers.
Early opinion polls indicate that Mr Fujimori's Change 90 party, with New
Majority, headed by former mining minister Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, will sweep
the board, but the volatility of the electorate means nothing can be taken
for granted.
International observers appointed by the Organisation of American States are
to start arriving in Lima today to monitor the electoral process.
MR Abimael Guzman, founder-leader of the Shining Path guerrilla movement has
been found guilty of treason after a 10-day summary trial by a closed court
martial. He now faces a life sentence.
He can appeal to a 'war council' and, if his conviction is upheld there, to
Peru's Supreme Military Court. President Alberto Fujimori has announced that
the appeals procedure has been accelerated, with both stages to be completed
within five days.
Radio reports said that suspected Shining Path guerrillas had killed six
members of Peru's security forces in an apparent reaction to the expected
life sentence.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPPONENTS of Canada's proposed new constitution have opened up a wide lead
in several key provinces, less than three weeks before a national referendum
on the constitutional package.
A Gallup poll published yesterday shows the No side is backed by 53 per cent
of decided voters in British Columbia, 51 per cent in the three prairie
provinces and 46 per cent in Quebec. Support for the deal in these regions
is estimated at between 30 and 36 per cent.
Doubts about the outcome of the October 26 referendum have already driven up
domestic interest rates and elicited warnings of further economic
turbulence. Mr Ted Newall, chief executive of Nova Corporation of Alberta,
one of the country's biggest energy and pipeline companies, warned on
Tuesday night that a No vote would, at best, mean 5-15 years of economic and
political uncertainty.
The constitutional package, known as the Charlottetown Agreement, is
supported by all three national parties, the leaders of all 10 provinces,
and the bulk of Canada's business community.
They have been put on the defensive, however, by having to acknowledge that
the agreement is a compromise which gives no region or interest group
everything it wants.
Critics of the deal, the most vociferous of whom include Quebec separatists,
western Canadian regional groups and women's activists, have had the
advantage of being able to highlight the agreement's weaknesses.
Quebec separatists, for instance, have emphasised how few new powers will be
transferred to the francophone province under the deal. The Alberta-based
Reform Party, on the other hand, has touched a sensitive nerve in western
Canada by pointing to a provision which guarantees Quebec a minimum of 25
per cent of the seats in the House of Commons.
In addition, many voters are using the referendum debate to vent a wider
range of frustrations with the political process.
The Yes side, which was slow to put its campaign into gear, still expects to
make up ground over the next few weeks. It is taking some comfort from the
high proportion of undecided voters - 22 per cent in Quebec and 17 per cent
in British Columbia.
The legal text of the Charlottetown Agreement is due to be published next
Monday, dealing with complaints that voters have not been able to assess the
fine print of the deal. Critics are expected to scour the text in search of
new ammunition for their arguments.

FT  08 OCT 92 / CIA gave wrong data on Iraq loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), in an unusual public statement on
intelligence matters, has admitted that it provided the US Justice
Department and federal prosecutors with incorrect information about illegal
loans to Iraq, made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del
Lavoro (BNL).
While denying it had made any effort to cover up knowledge of the BNL
affair, the CIA admitted that its response to a prosecutor's request for
information on the alleged involvement of BNL's Rome head office in the
Atlanta scandal was 'incomplete'.
Two weeks ago, the Justice Department made public a September 17 letter from
the CIA which claimed its only knowledge of Rome's awareness of the Iraqi
loans came from 'publicly available information.' This, however, was soon
contradicted by other CIA reports.
The issue of CIA knowledge of the illegal Iraqi loans is at the heart of the
BNL case since the Bush administration has argued in court that the entire
Dollars 5bn loan operation - of vital importance to Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein's nuclear, chemical and missile projects - was single-handedly
organised by BNL's former Atlanta manager.
Immediately after the CIA claim was made, however, a firestorm of criticism
was directed by Congressional leaders at Mr Robert Gates, CIA director. He
was accused of having provided misleading information, since classified CIA
reports sent to Congress explicitly stated that the CIA had independently
confirmed press reports that 'more senior BNL officials in Rome' knew of BNL
Atlanta's activities, and that some Iraqi loans had even been approved in
Rome.
The CIA's knowledge is also relevant since a federal judge said in Atlanta
last week he did not believe the US government's case. He ordered a full BNL
trial of the former Atlanta manager. The judge also said CIA documents he
had received provided 'definite' proof of Rome's involvement.
Judge Marvin Shoob also demanded that a special prosecutor investigate the
BNL case, a call that was also made by Mr Bill Clinton, the Democratic
presidential candidate.
Other documents released in Atlanta included a memo from one prosecutor who
was worried he might have accidentally stumbled onto a CIA covert operation
to arm Iraq by using BNL loans.
Mr Mark Mansfield, CIA spokesman, yesterday said there was no intention to
mislead anyone or to hold anything back. 'It was the result of an honest
mistake and a record system that is somewhat less than perfect,' he said.
Mr Mansfield added that Mr Gates had requested the CIA inspector-general to
conduct a review of the BNL issue and to report back by the end of the year.

Mr Khawand's colleagues say they do not know who is holding the Phalangist
central committee member, but the poster's message is simple enough: Syria,
which maintains 40,000 troops in Lebanon, has 'kidnapped' the country.
While most Lebanese have learned, however grudgingly, to live with the
Syrian presence, a hard core of Maronites continues to reject the influence
of Damascus as their leadership bickers and splinters in the aftermath of
parliamentary elections.
'Lebanese Christians have never been so full of despair,' Mr Issa Goraieb,
editor-in-chief of Beirut's l'Orient le Jour newspaper, says. 'It started
with the inter-Christian war in 1990. It's been downhill ever since.'
Five of the 128 parliamentary seats remain to be filled in a special
by-election in the strongly Maronite Kesrouan region on October 11. The
August 30 poll was postponed when all candidates in the region agreed to
boycott the vote. But 22 candidates have now registered for the by-election
 -and their change of heart has plunged Maronite leaders into an unseemly
bout of mud-slinging.
The candidates include Mr Fares Boueiz, who resigned as foreign minister in
August in protest at the holding of the original elections.
Mr Boueiz explains the reversal of his decision by claiming that the
Maronites are 'committing political suicide' and that Kesrouan cannot be
turned over to 'outsiders'. He condemns the Christian leaders most
vehemently opposed to the elections - ex-president Amin Gemayel, Raymond
Edde, Dory Chamoun and former rebel General Michel Aoun - for 'mixing
opposition and tourism' by living in France.
From Paris Mr Edde brands Mr Boueiz 'a (Syrian) agent'.
Gen Aoun yet again broke his promise to the French to refrain from political
statements, demanding that all Lebanese politicians resign from public
office.
The general, who has a wide but inactive following in Lebanon, will not be
allowed to return from his exile in Marseilles until 1995.
Phalange party president, Mr George Saade, who resigned as minister of post
and telecommunications, also in protest at the elections, now says that he
too regrets the boycott.
There will be 64 Christians in the new parliament which will convene for the
first time on October 16. But, says Mr Saade, 'not all Christians represent
Christianity'.
'The Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party (SSNP) has many Maronites. They won
nine seats in parliament - they took over our seats. Hizbollah won in Beirut
because the Christians didn't participate.'
Social changes in Lebanon since the last 1972 poll are reflected in the new
legislature: two of the women deputies were among the highest vote winners
in the country.
The presence, for the first time, of 12 Islamic fundamentalists in
parliament puts the Lebanese government in the awkward position of
officially negotiating with Israel even as the Iranian-backed Hizbollah,
which holds eight parliamentary seats, continue their almost daily attacks
on Israeli troops in southern Lebanon.
Perhaps the most pressing question which will face the cabinet, likely to be
formed next month, is the status of the almost half a million Palestinian
refugees in Lebanon. Neither the Palestine Liberation Organisation nor
Lebanese politicians want to give the refugees Lebanese nationality.
The PLO believes this would in effect relinquish their right of return to
what is now Israel. The Lebanese fear that making citizens of the mainly
Sunni Moslem Palestinian community would upset the country's sectarian
balance by making the Sunnis the largest minority in the country.
Many Lebanese suspect that the US wants the Palestinians to stay in Lebanon
as part of a final Middle East peace package. But they also credit US
pressure on Damascus for the expected withdrawal of Syrian troops from
Beirut before the end of the year.
Syria has already begun removing heavy weapons from the capital to the Bekaa
valley, a redeployment which is improving Lebanese morale, especially among
the Maronites. But Syria's influence over the Beirut government - and its
military presence in the north and east of the country - will remain for
years.
Although it dictates Lebanese security and foreign policy, Damascus has
largely refrained from intervening in the Lebanese economy. Three World Bank
and International Monetary Fund delegations will visit Beirut this autumn,
and Lebanese officials hope their findings will generate more than the
Dollars 150m World Bank emergency loan already granted for water,
electricity and telecommunications.
The Lebanese pound has lost nearly two-thirds of its value this year. Yet
the bread riots which brought down prime minister Omar Karami's government
in May seem a distant memory. Those riots were triggered when the Lebanese
pound fell to 2,000 to the dollar. The exchange rate is now 2,473 to the
dollar and the trade unions are all but silent. Outrage at Lebanon's
impoverishment has given way to stoic resignation.

SOUTH Korea's President Roh Tae-woo yesterday picked a university president
to head a neutral cabinet that will preside over December's presidential
election.
The opposition parties welcomed the choice of Mr Hyun Soong-jong, 73,
(pictured above) a law professor and president of Hallym University.
President Roh last month promised the appointment of a neutral caretaker
cabinet to persuade the opposition to end its three-month boycott of the
National Assembly.
The two opposition parties wanted guarantees that the government would not
use its agencies to influence the presidential election in favour of the
ruling Democratic Liberal party. This followed allegations of government
interference in the March parliamentary election. The National Assembly
resumed work on Monday.
New non-partisan ministers for the politically sensitive posts of justice,
home, information, political affairs and possibly the intelligence agency
will be announced tomorrow.
The rest of the cabinet, including the economic ministries, will remain
unchanged.

THE chairman of a Taiwanese company at the centre of the island's biggest
shares scandal has denied charges of manipulating stocks and has been
allowed bail, Reuter reports from Taipei.
Taipei's chief prosecutor Chuang Chun-shan freed Mr Peter Hsu, chairman of
the Formosan Rubber Group, on bail of TDollars 1m (Pounds 22,471) after
questioning.
Mr Hsu, who had been sought by agents of the Bureau of Investigation,
voluntarily appeared before the prosecutor. He denied collaborating with
detained leading stock market player Mr Lei Po-lung to manipulate the price
of shares of Formosan Rubber.
Meanwhile, Taiwan's Securities and Exchange Commission has recommended that
21 people be charged with stock manipulation. Mr Chuang said he would summon
the suspects for questioning before deciding whether to charge them.
He did not name any of them, but said they were individual investors. If
found guilty they could face seven years in prison.
The 21 allegedly manipulated the price of shares in Formosan Rubber, which
is at the centre of a scandal surrounding defaults on payments for TDollars
9bn stock purchases.
The price of Formosan Rubber's shares soared to TDollars 370 per share in
September from TDollars 68.50 in May. It closed at TDollars 89.50 yesterday.
A leading stock market player and a board member of Formosan Rubber are in
custody on similar charges.
Mr Lei Po-lung, one of four shadowy 'Big Hands' who often determine the
fortunes of the volatile and speculative market, was detained on September
20 for alleged involvement in a string of stock payment defaults that sent
the bourse plunging last month.
Mr Alex Hsu, a member of the board of directors of Formosan Rubber Group,
has been detained for allegedly collaborating with Mr Lei to prop up the
price of the company's shares.

THE Indian government said yesterday it would go ahead with the sale of
shares in eight state companies next Wednesday. The sale, through open
auction, is the second phase of a privatisation programme expected to raise
Rs35bn (Pounds 730m).
The eight include some of India's best performing government-owned
enterprises - the Steel Authority of India, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation
(formerly Esso Eastern), Bharat Petroleum (earlier Burmah Shell), and the
high-precision manufacturer Hindustan Machine Tools.
Shares in 31 state enterprises were sold last year, in the first phase of
Indian privatisations.
According to Mr Suresh Kumar, an official in the industries ministry, shares
in 12 more state enterprises will be sold in this financial year, ending
March 1993.
The open auction system is meant to ensure a more open and broad-based
method of privatisation, say officials. Last year, the government offered
random blocks of shares to mutual funds; this year, individual company
shares will be auctioned. The government has stipulated that each share
application not be less than Rs25m (Pounds 520,000) for the current tranche.
The government is selling 5 per cent of the total paid-up capital of the
eight enterprises, totalling Rs400m, to companies, financial institutions
and individuals, through sealed tenders to be opened on Wednesday. The face
value of each share is Rs10.
The sale, officials say, is being phased, in view of the size of India's
capital market relative to the assets of the public sector. Market circles
maintain that the government put back the auction from October 6 to October
14, fearing an inadequate response.
Individual investors, expecting the introduction of direct public offers
soon, are unlikely to make bids at the current auction. The minimum amount
of Rs25m to be offered is also too high for individuals, stockbrokers and
private sector financial companies, say market sources. The cautious
approach to buying is also related to investors not expecting high profits
on their investments, at least in the short run.
An indication of the poor response is that certain public sector shares
already on the market have plummetted in the last week. Hindustan Petroleum
shares fell from Rs1,200 to Rs650 this week, those of Bharat Petroleum fell
from Rs1,275 to Rs750, and Steel Authority of India shares slipped to Rs65
from Rs85.
When the government first decided to mobilise resources through
privatisation in July 1991, it envisaged privatising loss-making companies
which were a drain on the central budget. However, the government was forced
to offer some of its most profitable enterprises because it feared there
would be no takers for loss-making concerns, and that the fiscal adjustment
programme required by the International Monetary Fund would be in danger.

<TEXT>
MR Chris Patten, Hong Kong's governor, yesterday reshuffled his Executive
Council (ExCo) appointing leading lawyers and academics while retaining most
of the non-politicians appointed by his predecessor Lord Wilson.
He broke with 150 years of tradition by not including the commander of
British forces, Sir John Foley.
His appointments were mostly well received. Two distinguished barristers
were named, Mr Denis Chang and Mr Andrew Li. Mr Li shares chambers with Mr
Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats.
Both are opponents of the agreement reached between Britain and China last
year on the colony's Court of Final Appeal. Mr Patten would not be drawn
yesterday on the significance of their appointment, but indicated he might
revisit the issue of the court. 'I look forward to discussing the Court of
Final Appeal with my new Executive Council.'
Mr Patten also appointed one of the 44 Hong Kong citizens named by China to
advise Beijing on Hong Kong affairs. Mr Tung Chee-hwa, 54, is a director of
Orient Overseas Container Line and a former member of the Basic Law
Consultative Committee which advised Beijing on the drafting of the colony's
post-1997 constitution.
As expected Mr Patten retained the services of Mr William Purves, chairman
of HSBC Holdings, and Baroness Lydia Dunne. She delivered the heads of the
ExCo members by persuading them to submit letters of resignation. Baroness
Dunne's use to Mr Patten goes further than Hong Kong. Her seat in the
British House of Lords may be useful to him.

THE governor of Hong Kong, Mr Chris Patten, said yesterday that he would
discuss his proposals for greater democracy in the colony with the Chinese
government, but that Beijing would not be allowed to veto his plan.
Mr Patten will have the first opportunity to sound out Chinese officials
when he visits Beijing on October 21.
But the signs are that he will be given a rough ride.
China's official news agency Xinhua yesterday accused Mr Patten of being
'irresponsible and imprudent' because he had not discussed his proposals
with the Chinese authorities before announcing them.
That accusation was denied by the Foreign Office in London.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had given his Chinese opposite
number, Mr Qian Qichen, an outline of the proposals at their meeting in New
York on September 20.
The Chinese interpretation of 'consultations' is that only decisions with
which they agree should be announced, a British official said.
In an interview with British television, Mr Patten said that his proposals
reflected the legitimate aspirations of the people of Hong Kong for more
democracy.
But he made clear that he had also taken into account the need for his plan
to be consistent with China's Basic Law for the territory, the constitution
which will come into effect after the hand-over of the colony to Beijing in
1997.
If Beijing objected to his proposals, he would 'use such rhetorical gifts as
I can manage to convince China that this is in Hong Kong's long-term
interests and this is what the people of Hong Kong want.'
British officials stressed that the UK government would back Mr Patten's
pledge to try to persuade Beijing to accept a quickening of the pace of Hong
Kong's democratic development, with the specific aim of increasing the
number of directly-elected seats to the colony's Legislative Council
(Legco).
According to present plans, these seats are due to rise from 18 to 20 in
1995 out of a total of 60 Legco seats.
The officials recognised that any increase in the number of directly-elected
seats would require a change in the Basic Law and that there was little or
no chance that Beijing would agree to such a modification.
Mr Hurd's proposal to increase the number of directly-elected seats was
rejected by Qian Qichen at their New York meeting.
But the Foreign Office emphasises that greater democracy could also be
achieved by other means, notably through Mr Patten's ingenious proposal to
increase the number of functional constituencies for indirectly elected
seats and to extend them to include the entire working population.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Patten's proposals for democratic reform have angered the colony's
liberals who argue the changes do not go far enough.
Liberals were particularly angered by Mr Patten's announcement that the
colony's quasi cabinet, the Executive Council, would be closed to all party
politicians and that the executive and legislative councils would be split.
Mr Martin Lee, Hong Kong's prominent democracy activist, said splitting the
councils was 'the easy way out for the British government. It is a
retrograde step.
'What he should have done was do the right and honourable thing by giving us
full democracy now and using the next four-and-a-half years to convince
China. Poll after poll shows that the people want democracy although they
know China would not approve.
'I can't think of a single proposal he made that the last governor could not
have done.'
Professor Peter Harris, a political scientist at the colony's university,
explaining the negative reaction to Mr Patten's proposals said: 'The
constitutional changes are going to hit a lot of people who had a lot of
power in this town for a long time. They're going to lose a lot of face.'
However, business analysts welcomed Mr Patten's blueprint - but said
investors should wait to see the extent of China's anger before loosening
their purse strings.
'The mood in the trading room was very relaxed after the speech,' said Mr
Howard Gorges, managing director of South China Securities.
Mr Paul Cheng, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce welcomed the framework of
an executive-led 'yet more accountable government'.
He also said the chamber applauded the governor's Business Council, 'which
provides an opportunity for a direct dialogue and close co-operation between
the business community and the governor'.

WHEN Mr Chris Patten made his way to Hong Kong in early July he stopped over
in Singapore to meet Mr Lee Kwan Yew, the island republic's senior minister.
'Mr Lee gave me one very good piece of advice,' Mr Patten recalled later.
'He said I should lay all my plans out and tell the Chinese what I intend to
do in the next five years.'
Yesterday, Britain's 28th governor of Hong Kong was true to that advice.
In a two-hour speech, opening the 1992-1993 session of the Legislative
Council, Mr Patten outlined in detail his proposals for the colony's social
and political development in the years up to June 30, 1997, when Hong Kong
reverts to Chinese sovereignty.
A good two-thirds of his address was devoted to underlining his commitment
to social policy in Hong Kong - a place not associated with the values of
the Nanny state or even One-Nation Toryism. But the most significant part
came at the end when he turned to constitutional development.
Mr Patten tried to steer a course between the democratic aspirations of the
people of Hong Kong and the political realities of the colony's reversion to
authoritarian China, in just under five years. As he expected, democrats in
Hong Kong and the Chinese government were both negative in their initial
response.
His proposals on the current state of constitutional affairs had been well
telegraphed. He has split the membership of the Executive Council - his
quasi-cabinet - from the legislature, thereby shedding the conservative
representatives appointed by his predecessor, Lord Wilson.
At the same time he has promised to appear before the legislature to answer
its questions, pledged to give it financial and administrative autonomy and
encouraged it to establish a system of parliamentary committees which can
oversee and challenge the government on policy.
More controversial, however, are his proposals for the conduct of the 1995
elections. He revealed in his address that Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign
secretary, has formally raised with China the issue of allowing more
democratically-elected seats in 1995.
He held out little hope for success in this. China has set its face against
allowing more than 20 of the 60 seats to be contested by popular vote.
Instead, he produced a package which aims at maximum democracy within the
constraint of the Basic Law, the colony's mini-constitution drafted by
Beijing in the aftermath of the Tiananmen mass-acre of June 1989.
He proposes to have the 230 seats of Hong Kong district and urban councils
elected democratically - at present a third are appointed. He further
proposes that the 230 people elected form an electoral college that will
elect 10 members to the legislature in 1995.
In 1995, 30 representatives will be elected through the so-called
'functional' constituencies - small lobbies representing various business
and professional sectors. Mr Patten proposed that for the existing 21
functional constituencies the franchise be widened.
He plans nine new functional constituencies to represent broad industry
groups, such as electricity and gas. These would produce individual
electorates of between 199,000 and 454,000 persons, totalling 2.5m potential
voters.
None of Mr Patten's proposals violates the letter of the Basic Law and this
allows him to present them as being in accord with that law.
'I think that the package I put forward hangs together. I think it
represents a useful but not extreme step forward in broadening participation
in Hong Kong's affairs,' he told the press. 'Why have a great fuss now? Let
us demonstrate that it can work. . .If China wants to change it back, then
it won't lose anything in its own terms.'
That quotation contains both the carrot and the stick of Mr Patten's
strategy. What he seems likely to say to China is that his proposals are in
China's best interests; that they will deliver to China a Hong Kong content
with its political structures. But the last sentence indicates that he might
just do it without approval.
Mr Patten did not only address constitutional matters. Some impressive
spending commitments were made.
More will be spent on improving services to the elderly and the handicapped;
more will be dedicated to income support, retraining, education, housing and
the environment. Spending in these areas will rise 21 per cent in real terms
to 1997; HKDollars 8bn (Pounds 600m) more will be spent in 1996-97 than
otherwise planned.
As for capital spending, HKDollars 3bn will be put towards improving Hong
Kong's sewerage system - in an attempt to clean up Victoria Harbour, one of
the filthiest stretches of water in the world.
The funds to be deployed come from a windfall gain to the exchequer this
year. Instead of a budget surplus in 1992-93 of HKDollars 7.5bn, the
government now expects to have a surplus of HKDollars 13.5bn. 'Being that
prudent would not be very sensible,' Mr Patten observed yesterday.
Having addressed the concerns of social welfare, Mr Patten also attended to
some business concerns. The announcement of a monetary authority will be
well received. But it will be no Bundesbank: it will report to the financial
secretary.
Mr Patten's creation of a Business Council should also be welcomed The first
task he has set this council is to advise him on competition policy.
In spite of Hong Kong's free-wheeling capitalist image, many companies
depend for their existence on exclusive or duopolistic franchises awarded to
them by the government; or operate in cartels, such as banking and food
retailing. The Business Council's report will be eagerly awaited.

CHINA accused Hong Kong Governor Chris Patten of irresponsibility yesterday
over his proposals for sweeping democratic changes to the colony in the last
years of British rule, a Beijing-controlled news agency reported, Reuter
reports from Hong Kong.
In its initial response, the China News Service (CNS) quoted a spokesman for
the Hong Kong branch of the Xinhua news agency, as saying that any plans for
political reform should be discussed with Beijing before being announced.
Xinhua is Beijing's de facto embassy in the colony.
Beijing is deeply suspicious of political reform in Hong Kong, especially
after hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong citizens took to the streets to
demonstrate against the 1989 Beijing massacre of student democracy
protesters.
Earlier, Mr Patten disclosed proposals which would drastically increase the
power of Hong Kong people to elect the colony's legislature, the Legislative
Council (Legco), at the next elections in 1995.
Legislators elected in 1995 will win four-year terms, taking them well past
Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China.
'As the 1995 election is related to a smooth transition (to Chinese rule),
it should be discussed between both sides and a mutual agreement reached
before it is announced,' the spokesman said.
China had asked for this to happen but the British side had ignored this
request, he said.
'It is very irresponsible and imprudent. The Chinese side will not be
responsible for any arguments caused.'
It was not clear in Hong Kong last night whether the Xinhau response was
China's definitive view, or simply an initial reaction.
The Xinhua spokesman said the reforms could breach the 1984 Sino-British
Joint Declaration, under which Britain agreed to return Hong Kong to China
in 1997.
'If major changes to Hong Kong's political system are made during the
transitional period, thus leading to a weakening of the executive-led
administration, it is a breach of the Joint Declaration,' the spokesman
said.
Britain and China have agreed that under Hong Kong's system of limited
democracy, the politicalsystem should be executive-led, withthe legislature
having only limited powers.
China has implacably opposed British efforts to raise the number of
directly-elected members and analysts say Mr Patten appears to be trying to
boost Hong Kong democracy while still sticking to the letter of Chinese
demands.

MR PATTEN'S economic plans embrace the icons of the past, but at the same
time offer novel prescriptions - including commitments to tackle head-on the
problems of monetary stability, inflation, and skills shortages.
He proposed creating a number of important institutions: a Governor's
Business Council to advise 'on how best we can sustain our economic growth';
a formal Monetary Authority to help in ensuring monetary stability; and an
Efficiency Unit to enhance public sector efficiency.
Mr Patten talked optimistically of 'a 'trade wind' that promises to sweep
the region, creating in its wake an economic revolution as great as any seen
in Europe or North America since the start of industrialisation'.
'Hong Kong's position is strong; but it is not impregnable,' he said,
announcing plans to 'mobilise the very best talent and experience that Hong
Kong has to offer' to advise on maintaining future growth.
The Business Council will be mandated to advise on:
how the territory might remains 'the most business-friendly location in
Asia';
the impact of government policies on business;
how to maximise the potential of Hong Kong's location and resources;
promotion of trade and industry.
The assault on inflation, now in double figures and being driven by economic
growth expected to average 5 per cent over the next five years, will focus
on enhanced efficiency. This involves a commitment to prevent public
spending from growing faster than the economy as a whole.
Control of inflation has been hampered by the need to retain the politically
stabilising link between the Hong Kong dollar and the US dollar. It has been
maintained at this level - despite sometimes-fierce pressure to revalue -
because of the need to maintain confidence in the currency during any
political turbulence in the run-up to the transfer of sovereignty to China
in 1997.
Mr Patten repeated unequivocally that the exchange rate link 'must and will
remain'. 'The political risks of tampering with the link would be enormous,'
he said.
The Monetary Authority, brings together the Office of the Exchange Fund and
the Banking Commission. He felt this would 'enhance our ability to maintain
monetary stability in the years to come'.
In tackling labour and skills shortages, Mr Patten announced a Retraining
Fund, endowed with HKDollars 300m (Pounds 22.7m), but funded thereafter by
levies on employers when they seek permission to import workers. This fund
is expected to enable the government to retrain 15,000 workers over three
years.
The government will also boost funding of the Research Grants Council from
HKDollars 122m this year to HKDollars 180m in 1994-95.

ACCIDENT investigators yesterday recovered the 'black box' flight recorder
from the El Al Boeing 747 cargo jet which crashed into two Amsterdam housing
blocks on Sunday, killing at least 250 people.
Dutch officials at first warned that the flight recorder, which has been
flown to the Farnborough Accident Investigation Centre in the UK for
decoding, was badly damaged but later Mr Henk Wolleswinkel, the chief crash
investigator, said it looked in better shape than initial reports had led
him to believe.
He said: 'We're really crossing our fingers that we can get some useful
information out of it.' He noted, however, that the flight recorder had been
battered and exposed to extreme heat.
Piecing together the cause of the crash is proving difficult. Search teams
have so far not found the separate cockpit voice recorder, which could
reveal the last conversations between the pilots.
Adding to the investigators' difficulties, only one of the engines has been
found in a lake nine miles from the crash site.
This has raised the possibility that earlier reports that both starboard
engines had broken loose were incorrect.
Officials say the two pieces of engine found so far now appear to be two
halves of the same Pratt &amp; Whitney engine. There was also no trace of fire.

THE United States, Britain and France have approved the main outlines of a
UN draft resolution to ban Serbian combat flights in Bosnia, but with no
immediate provision for enforcement, diplomats said last night.
However, that could be the subject of a subsequent Security Council measure
if the Serbs defy the ban.
Favouring a two-tier approach, Britain and France are known to fear that the
use of allied fighter aircraft to enforce a no-fly order could place UN
peacekeeping troops at serious risk as they escorted humanitarian aid
convoys.
The UN force is soon to be greatly strengthened by the deployment of about
5,000 western European and Canadian soldiers.
The western proposal calls for UN monitoring of the no-fly order.
Reconnaissance aircraft could be used for that purpose. The question is
expected to be taken up by the Security Council shortly, perhaps as early as
tomorrow.
In an effort to head off a UN resolution on a no-fly zone, Bosnian Serbs on
Tuesday said they were prepared to suspend military flights over Bosnia.
Militant Serbs warned that a no-fly order would prompt them to walk out of
the Geneva peace talks.
Diplomats appeared confident last night that Russia would go along with the
draft and that China, while not supporting it, would not exercise its veto.
India and Zimbabwe are expected to abstain.
The draft resolution is the result of a US initiative following President
George Bush's statement last Friday that Serbian raids showed 'flagrant
disregard for human life'. Earlier, France had proposed UN action to bar
Serbian combat flights in Bosnia.
The Serbs are believed to have at least 20 combat aircraft in the country.
Cluster bombs have been used to attack Moslem and Croatian positions.
The US is expected to provide crucial intelligence and other support to the
new UN forces due to be deployed to protect aid convoys in Bosnia, writes
David White, Defence Correspondent.
It is expected that US officers will join a headquarters operation drawn
largely from the existing structure of Nato's Germany-based Northern Army
Group. The main US contribution on the ground would be a field hospital, but
it is thought Washington may also provide heavy airlift to help with the
deployment.
The move is significant both for the US, in committing even limited numbers
of military personnel, and for the UN, in extending the scope of
peacekeeping operations to include intelligence-gathering. US participation
is understood to have been sealed despite initial French reservations. The
force will be commanded by France's General Philippe Morillon, with Britain
providing the largest number of troops.

<TEXT>
NATO said yesterday it was deeply worried by the fighting in Georgia, amid
signs that the west is growing pessimistic that former Soviet republics can
overcome the problems and conflicts they face, Reuter reports from Brussels.
'We are deeply worried,' said Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary general.
'I think we have enough conflicts, crises and wars in the whole
Euro-Atlantic area,' he said. 'We do not need more.'
Georgia's embattled ruling State Council has sent its Foreign Minister
Alexander Chikvaidze to Nato after asking the alliance in a letter to use
'all possible means' to prevent the republic's break-up.
Mr Chikvaidze will visit the alliance today to discuss the conflict. Mr
Worner said Nato's 16 member-nations were trying to help find a peaceful
solution to the fighting between government troops and Abkhazian
separatists.
The alliance has so far refused to offer any of its former cold war enemies
security guarantees or military assistance and prefers to leave the task of
mediation to bodies such as the United Nations or the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe.
What worries Nato is not so much the fighting, but the possibility it could
drag Russia into a war with Georgia and that the conflict would spread.
Georgia wants control over Russian military equipment on its territory to
fight what it says is a Russian-inspired uprising. Moscow says it will
defend its legitimate interests.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Serbian forces complete the jigsaw: Laura Silber reports on
the significance of the capture of the town of Bosanski Brod
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FALL of the northern Bosnian town of Bosanski Brod to Serb fighters
marks a serious setback for both Croat and Moslem forces in the region.
The victory, on Tuesday night, consolidated the hold of Bosnian Serbs over
the former Yugoslav republic.
It has enabled them to widen the east-west corridor which they now occupy
between Serbia in the east and Banja Luka, their military headquarters, in
the north-west.
The military success also gives the Bosnian Serbs easier access to Serb-held
territories in Croatia.
The battle was won in hand-to-hand fighting after Serb forces overran
Bosanski Brod.
The bridge linking Bosanski Brod with Slavonski Brod, its Croatian twin city
across the River Sava, was blown up, cutting off access to the town from the
Croatian side.
Military police in Slavonski Brod said yesterday that about 10,000 civilians
fled into Croatia in boats and barges, or across the bridge before it was
mined.
The town's oil refinery was ablaze and the streets were reported to be
littered with corpses.
Casualty reports have not been confirmed but most of the 34,000 civilian
inhabitants of the town and surrounding villages had already fled.
Serb forces now control all but three towns in the Posavina, the rich land
along the River Sava which marks the border between Bosnia and Croatia.
Moslems and Croats still have tentative control over Orasje, Gradacac and
part of Brcko, north-eastern Bosnia.
However, it appears that it will be only a matter of days before Serb
forces, which control about 70 per cent of Bosnia, defeat these isolated
strongholds. Belgrade radio reported fierce clashes around Brcko yesterday.
Bosanski Brod was one of the first towns in Bosnia to erupt in violence at
the end of March after Croats and Moslems in Bosnia voted for independence
for the republic against the wishes of the Serb population, who boycotted
the referendum. The Serbs wanted to stay within a Serb-controlled
Yugoslavia.
Croatian forces initially had the upper hand in the area, but in July Mr
Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia, ordered the withdrawal of Croatian
army units from the town.
The order followed threats by the international community that United
Nations sanctions would be imposed on Croatia for its role in the Bosnian
war, diplomats say. (UN sanctions, including an oil embargo, were placed on
the rump Yugoslavia on May 31).
Mr Tudjman has been criticised by many Croats for failing to support Croat
and Moslem fighters in Bosanski Brod. Slavonski Brod is hit daily by
grenades and mortars fired by Serb forces into neighbouring Croatia.
Posavina is a key region which before the war was inhabited by some 20 per
cent of Bosnia's 750,000 Croats. The failure of the Croats to hold Bosanski
Brod reflects the Croat leadership's preoccupation with Western Hercegovina,
the sparsely populated but ethnically compact region declared by Croats as
part of Herceg-Bosna, the self-proclaimed Croat state in Bosnia, a western
diplomat said yesterday.
Mr Mate Boban, leader of the Croatian Democratic Union, the sister party of
Croatia's ruling party, has had frequent contact with Mr Radovan Karadzic,
the leader of Bosnian Serb forces, in an attempt to divide Bosnia between
the two republics.
According to another western diplomat, the two leaders share a contempt for
Moslems, who made up 44 per cent of Bosnia's pre-war population of 4.35m.
'Boban appears to believe he can strike a deal with Karadzic. But the
Croats, more poorly armed, will end up losing,' he said.
If Bosanski Brod was part of a deal between Croats and Serbs to divide
Bosnia, it would appear Mr Boban has wildly miscalculated. It leaves
Slavonski Brod and parts of Croatia vulnerable to Serb forces.
However, the Bosnian Serbs are unlikely to be able to maintain their grip
over all the land they have captured in the former republic.
Belgrade radio yesterday reported fighting around Brcko and Bosanski Brod as
well as in the eastern Bosnian towns of Zvornik and Bratunac, on the border
with Serbia.
The occupation by Serb forces in certain areas could be tested by a
guerrilla campaign which could be launched by Moslem and Croat soldiers
anxious to improve their positions before winter.

Iceland's centre-right government has proposed a 1993 draft budget that
would cut state spending and hold down inflation, but opposition politicians
yesterday branded the plan unrealistic, Reuter reports from Reykjavik.
Mr Fridrik Sophusson, the finance minister, said yesterday that expenditure
would be reduced in real terms by 3 per cent from 1992.
'One of the main goals of the economic policy is to create conditions for
growth; to get the wheels of the economy rolling again,' he said.
Cuts for health, education and the government housing loan fund are
proposed. Subsidies on farm products would be eliminated, though they will
be partly replaced by direct payments to farmers.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Iceland finds enemy to replace Soviet N-subs: Robert Corzine
reports on whaling's cold war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian nuclear attack submarines which used to roam the waters off
Iceland during the cold war no longer pose a threat to the country's
prosperous isolation. Most of the 'floating Chernobyls', as they are known
locally, lie rusting away in Russian ports, with only the occasional foray
into the North Atlantic being picked up by Nato's surveillance system on the
island.
But something sinister still lurks beneath the waves, according to the
Icelandic government, and that is the Minke whale. Officials in the capital,
Reykjavik, believe an estimated 100,000 of the mammals are eating their way
through the dwindling stocks of cod in Iceland's 200-mile exclusive economic
zone.
The fear of the Minke's impact on the country's dominant economic resource
is such that Iceland walked out of the International Whaling Commission
meeting in Glasgow in June, vowing to resume limited whaling next year.
'It would be a death warrant for Iceland unless we are allowed to continue
as a hunting nation,' says Mr Jon Baldvin Hannibalsson, the foreign
minister. 'We are prepared to fight for the principle of being able to use
marine resources,' although he acknowledges that the threat of retaliatory
sanctions or consumer boycotts of Icelandic products is real, particularly
in the US and Europe.
The pristine condition of the four whaling ships laid up in Reykjavik
harbour may testify to the Icelanders' determination to resume the hunt for
what their research suggests is not an endangered species. But the ships are
old and likely to be the last of their line - new investment is reserved for
modern freezer trawlers crammed with the latest in electronic gear, if not
fish.
The sensitivity of a small country to what it perceives to be outside
interference explains some of the government's defiance on the issue. But
its hard line over whaling and the right to exploit marine resources may
also mask deeper fears that the international concern over whales and other
marine mammals could eventually be extended to large-scale fishing
generally.
And that would call into question the economic viability of Iceland. The
crisis in the fishing industry has caused a recession which is now in its
fifth year, with the 'steepest decline ahead', according to Mr Hannibalsson.
The stocks of cod, which account for 40 per cent of fish exports and which
in turn represent 80 per cent of total exports, are close to collapse,
according to the International Council for Exploration of the Seas. Last
June it recommended a 40 per cent cut in Iceland's quota for 1993, a move
which would have reduced sharply Iceland's foreign exchange earnings.
The government shied away from such a drastic cut, but two months ago it
slashed the 1993 quota by 27 per cent. Although the fishing industry employs
only 5 per cent of the workforce, it is the base upon which Iceland has
built an enviable prosperity for its 250,000 citizens, who enjoy an average
annual income per head of about Dollars 25,000.
Alternative export industries on the scale of the fishing sector are not
readily apparent. The sharp decline in the cod catch in recent years
prompted the government to promote fish farming, but the results have not
been encouraging.
A proposal to exploit Iceland's hydroelectric potential by laying one of the
world's longest cables across 950km of ocean to northern Scotland, where it
could plug into the European grid, is technically feasible. But the
associated dams and direct current link would cost more than Pounds 1bn and
take 12-15 years to build. Plans by a Swedish, Dutch and American consortium
to build a second aluminium smelter to join a Swiss-owned one already
operating on the island are in abeyance because of uncertainty over demand
for the metal. Other industries, including steel and chemical companies,
might also be persuaded to build plants.
Some Icelanders, however, worry that more industrial schemes would hurt the
country's reputation for having the most pollution-free environment in
Europe. They fear it could also damage the growing tourism industry. 'If
this becomes a long-term decline then we could lose our best people,' says
Mr Hannibalsson. He points out that a third of the skilled work force has
been educated abroad and that many could move relatively easily, especially
to Europe.
Icelandic membership of the European Economic Area (EEA) - which Mr
Hannibalsson says should be approved by the end of the year - could
facilitate any exodus. But without the EEA Iceland 'would be in danger of
political isolation and of being excluded from European affairs', he says.
The government's enthusiasm for closer formal ties to Europe is strictly
limited, however, and there is no sign that it will follow other Nordic
countries towards full participation in the EC.

<TEXT>
Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), the Daimler-Benz subsidiary which includes most
of Germany's key aerospace contractors, is to cut its workforce by 7,500 in
the next two years because of reduced orders, writes Quentin Peel. The cuts,
more than 10 per cent of the 70,000 employees in companies ranging from
Deutsche Airbus to MBB and MTU, will affect all main divisions.
The job losses, which may include redundancies as well as natural wastage,
do not take into account possible cancellation of the European fighter
aircraft programme, in which Dasa is the German partner.
The company is also a partner with France's Aerospatiale in the Tiger
anti-tank helicopter project, another scheme where German participation is
now in doubt.
No major defence contracts were expected in the next two years, a spokesman
said.

FT  08 OCT 92 / German doubts grow about single currency: Gap widens between
business and politicians over benefits of European monetary union
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN business managers, unlike their national representatives, are
becoming increasingly sceptical about the advantages of a single European
currency, according to a new opinion survey.
Only 40 per cent of German enterprises questioned by the Ifo economic
research institute are now in favour of such a currency, compared with 60
per cent three years ago.
However, a growing number believe that it will be introduced for political
reasons, in spite of the apparent opposition of the business sector.
The results of the survey coincided with remarks from Mr Hilmar Kopper, the
chief executive of Deutsche Bank, suggesting that the EC should set its
sights on establishing a 'lean' monetary union, excluding some member states
until they meet entry conditions.
Mr Kopper said economic reason dictated that the formal deadline for
currency union - 1999 at the latest - could not be met. At the same time the
EC should re-examine plans for an automatic shift to a single currency later
this decade. Only three members, excluding Germany, so far met the
convergence criteria set down in the Maastricht treaty, he said.
German concerns about the pace and nature of monetary union coincided with a
new broadside at the unnecessary regulations emanating from Brussels,
published by the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry (DIHT), in support
of the campaign for greater 'subsidiarity' - or devolution of
decision-making - in the EC.
The DIHT singled out a series of directives from Brussels, such as the
package tour directive, the directive on time-share contracts, and the
European Commission recommendation on the regulation of insurance brokers
where it says regulation should be done at the national level.
The scepticism and criticism comes only two days after the leaders of German
industry publicly backed Chancellor Helmut Kohl in his ambition to press
ahead urgently with ratification of the Maastricht treaty, underlining the
obvious division between German public opinion and the Bonn establishment.
The Ifo survey shows that no less than 80 per cent of the businessmen
questioned believe that the treaty requires improvement. Of those, 7 per
cent want improvements in the provisions for political union, 24 per cent
economic and monetary union and 69 per cent want improvements in both parts
of the document.
The proportion who believe that 'our hard D-Mark cannot be replaced by
anything else' has risen from 35 to 49 per cent over three years. However,
there is a marginal fall - from 80 to 76 per cent - in the number who
believe that a European currency would be less stable than the D-Mark.
The Ifo researchers say German businessmen have always been more sceptical
about the advantages of the single currency than their EC partners.
Four-fifths of them already denominate all their cross-border trade in
D-Marks, and therefore do not suffer from exchange rate risks.
The DIHT insists rapid ratification of Maastricht is still most desirable.
But it backs the campaign for more subsidiarity.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday continued its intense diplomatic activities in advance of
next week's European Community summit in Birmingham by trying to persuade
sceptical governments in Portugal and Spain to relax their opposition to
weakening the powers of the European Commission.
Mr Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, met his Portuguese colleague, Mr Jao
de Deus Pinheiro, in Lisbon yesterday afternoon before flying to Madrid for
late night talks with Mr Javier Solana, the new Spanish foreign minister.
Portugal and Spain are worried that British and German efforts to widen the
application of the principle of 'subsidiarity' - whereby the EC defers to
member states in matters which can best be handled by national parliaments -
constitutes an attack on the powers of Brussels.
Mr Hurd said in Madrid that Germany had prepared a 'strong paper' on
subsidiarity.
This reportedly calls on the EC to defer to regional governments as well as
to national ones.
It has caused particular concern in Madrid, which fears such a proposal
could be used by Spain's autonomous governments to weaken links with the
central government.
In general, both Portugal and Spain worry that trimming Commision powers
will reduce the funds that the less developed EC partners rely on from the
Community in order to narrow the gap with richer members.
Seeking to allay such misgivings, Mr Hurd said: 'We do not intend to alter
the balance of the (EC) institutions. We do not want take anything away from
the Community, we want to add to it. We certainly do not want to make the
Community's decisions more difficult.'

This seem certain to anger ethnic Russians and Ukrainians who make up nearly

The decree was issued by Russia's President Boris Yeltsin less than 10 hours
after a leading Russian newspaper published a scathing interview with Mr
Gorbachev in which he said his successor 'is clearly not coping with his
duties'.
Mr Yeltsin transferred the buildings to the Russian government's new
Financial Academy, an institution charged with teaching banking and trading.
The presidential decree directs the academy to allow Mr Gorbachev and the
dozens of employees of his Gorbachev Foundation to use one of the buildings
on the property if they can pay the rent.
In yesterday's interview Mr Gorbachev described himself as a 'refusenik',
presumably in reference to his refusal to testify to Russia's constitutional
court on the issue of the illegality of the communist party and the
government's subsequent ban on him travelling abroad.

FT  08 OCT 92 / EC entry no match for EEA: Bigger benefits for Efta states
seen in European economic area plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European economic area (EEA) is likely to give Nordic and Alpine
countries an economic boost of up to 5 per cent of gross domestic product if
it comes into effect next year as planned.
According to an analysis published in London today by the Centre for
Economic Policy Research, the economic gains for Sweden, Finland, Austria,
Switzerland and Norway stemming from the free-market EEA will probably
greatly outstrip the benefits accruing from EC membership later in the
1990s.
However, it believes the members of the European Free Trade Association
(Efta) are likely to maintain their bid to join the EC, above all because of
the political benefits of full membership.
The study says the economic gains from the EEA will come about particularly
from the effects of greater competition in the Efta economies. This will
lead to lower goods prices and more effective allocation of resources.
Additionally, through linking up with the EC's 'single market', Efta states
will benefit from additional capital investment which would otherwise have
flowed to the Community. They would face an overall drop in economic welfare
if the single market went ahead without them, the report points out.
Efta countries will face additional budgetary burdens from full EC
membership later in the 1990s. Since average per capita income in Efta is
about 40 per cent above the EC figure in nominal terms, the Efta states
preparing for EC membership will all become net budgetary contributors. They
will make an estimated total net annual contribution to EC coffers of around
Ecu5bn (Pounds 3.9bn).
The report says the planned EEA agreement provides economic benefits to the
Efta states without the 'political baggage' stemming from full membership -
which would imply adherence to the Maastricht treaty.
However, the Efta nations want to apply for full membership to win a role in
the political development of the Community, as well as to participate in
other areas of EC policies such as economic and monetary union and the
common agricultural policy.
The study provides a gloomy assessment of the chances of EC accession by the
former communist states of eastern and central Europe.
These countries will have to 'stabilise their economies, rationalise their
institutions and achieve several decades of above average economic growth'
before they can think realistically of full membership.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Abortion referendum bound to be divisive: Even the Irish
cabinet is in deep disagreement over the issue
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IRISH government's decision to submit the country's constitutional ban
on abortion to a referendum in December promises a stormy and divisive
political debate over the next two months.
Deep disagreement over the issue is reflected at cabinet level, within the
main political parties, and down to the family dinner table.
After six months of deliberation on the issue, the government announced on
Tuesday that a referendum would be held on December 3. The electorate will
be asked if they approve of the right of women to travel abroad for an
abortion, if women should be entitled to obtain information on how to go
about this, and whether abortion should be made available within Ireland
under exceptional circumstances (this has been euphemistically termed the
'substantive issue').
Within the cabinet Mr Des O'Malley, the leader of the Progressive Democrats,
the junior partners in the coalition, warned earlier this week that the
'substantive issue' should be dealt with by legislation and not a
referendum, as it would be too politically divisive at a time when key
decisions on Northern Ireland and the economy will also have to be taken.
The Northern Ireland round-table talks face a deadline of November 16 to
come up with a new legislative framework for the province, and if any
workable accommodation is to be reached with the Ulster Unionists this will
inevitably require a commitment by the Irish government to drop the
Republic's territorial claim. The claim is enshrined in the constitution and
any change to it will trigger stiff opposition from hardline nationalists.
On the economic front, the government is facing an unprecedented jobs
crisis, with unemployment at 21 per cent, exacerbated by sterling's recent
devaluation, and is struggling to maintain the punt within the ERM.
Devaluation would leave Ireland without an economic policy.
However, under pressure from the pro-life campaigners within his Fianna Fail
party who want to air the abortion issue after a controversial Supreme Court
ruling last March, Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, decided to submit
the idea of limited abortion in Ireland to a vote.
The Supreme Court ruling, in approving an abortion for a 14-year-old rape
victim, in effect established the right to abortion in Ireland for women who
face a threat to their lives, including the threat of suicide. But the
country's top judges also concluded that where such a threat to the life of
the mother does not exist, then pregnant women seeking an abortion abroad
can legally be prevented from doing so.
The ruling deeply upset both the pro- and anti-abortion lobbies, forcing the
government into a commitment last April that legislation and/or a referendum
would be forthcoming by the end of the year.
The Catholic Church Bishops said in March: 'Abortion has now been declared
legal in Ireland. . .experience has shown that laws permitting abortion even
in restricted circumstances rapidly lead to abortion on demand. A
particularly urgent challenge now faces our legislators as they seek to
exercise their responsibility to protect the lives of unborn children.'

FT  08 OCT 92 / Ireland digs in for long siege over punt
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government appears to be digging in for a long siege, lasting
months rather than weeks, in its defence of the punt and its membership of
the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Ireland's return to borrowing in the foreign currency market in the past
week, and the launching on Tuesday of an IPounds 50m 'market development
fund' to protect 30,000 manufacturing jobs put at risk as a result of
sterling's free float outside the ERM, are signals that no one in government
is about to unfurl the white flag of devaluation yet.
In announcing the fund on Tuesday, Mr Des O'Malley, the trade and commerce
minister, said 'We are hopeful that we will not have to increase the
exchequer borrowing requirement as we have made savings this year. But we do
need to assist those companies affected by the crisis'.
The fund is to be disbursed over the next six months, at a rate of IPounds
50 a week per job under threat, and is equivalent to approximately 20 per
cent of the average industrial wage.
'We hope the problem will not be prolonged,' Mr O'Malley said, adding that a
review would be made in December.
Some European diplomats were yesterday questioning whether the measures
amounted to state aids to industry and involved elements of market
distortion in breach of EC competition rules. 'It seems more like a market
protection fund rather than a market development fund,' said one.
Mr O'Malley said that he did not anticipate any problems with the package
under EC competition law, 'as we already have agreement with the EC for a
market development fund. This will be an extension of it'.
The success of the government's strategy will depend, however, on whether it
will be possible to reduce interest rates within the next few weeks.
Inflation is running at less than an annualised 3 per cent, but Dublin
one-month interbank money market rates have shot up to over 17 per cent.
As one market analyst said yesterday: 'If they continue for long at these
levels, growth in the economy will come to a full stop'.
By announcing last week that it intends to raise up to a total of IPounds
500m in foreign currency to replace short-term Irish gilts, the government
is signalling that a devaluation is not planned. The government's current
foreign debt is close to IPounds 9bn, two-thirds of which is denominated in
D-Marks and Swiss francs.
Were Ireland to devalue to sterling's current level against the D-Mark, the
government's annual debt service bill would increase by some IPounds
70-100m, equivalent to a 1-1.5p in the pound increase in income tax - a move
that would only be undertaken as a last resort.

Romania's fractious political groups appeared no closer to forming a

The election has produced a hung parliament where reform-minded parties are
slightly outnumbered by more reactionary and nationalist groups.
No government is expected to emerge until after Sunday's presidential

FT  08 OCT 92 / Public spending faces further cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT will today seek to restore the government's credibility in
financial markets by putting tough control of public spending at the heart
of the economic strategy which replaces UK membership of the European
exchange rate mechanism.
As the chancellor prepared to set out at the Tory conference the new ground
rules for his economic policy, cabinet colleagues said the Treasury wanted
to lower further the Pounds 244.5bn spending figure agreed for next year.
In spite of public admissions that the existing target would involve
significant cash reductions for most Whitehall spending programmes, the
minsters said the Treasury was emphasising that the figure was a 'ceiling'
rather than a target.
Ministers said the allocation of the overall budget between different
departments would not be agreed for several weeks, but it was already clear
several once-cherished projects would be cut.
The Treasury has told spending ministers that four unavoidable spending
increases - on the unemployed, EC farm subsidies, legal aid and on the
increased numbers in higher education - have more than wiped out the Pounds
4bn available from the Treasury's contingency reserve.
With more than Pounds 1bn allotted to ease the replacement of the poll tax
by the council tax, it would be impossible to avoid cash reductions in
budgets ranging from health to overseas aid.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, whose unemployment benefit
budget will rise sharply as a result of the recession, acknowledged
yesterday he faced much tighter constraints on discretion benefits for the
poor and disabled. Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, and Mr John
Patten, the education secretary, admitted they faced a squeeze on resources.
Mr Lamont intends to use his speech to the conference to set out the broad
parameters of his anti-inflation strategy.
Apart from tight control of spending, he will say interest rates will be set
to meet monetary targets with both exchange rate and asset prices taken into
account.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Thatcher shatters Tory unity hope: Former prime minister
denounces Maastricht treaty as the 'vision of yesterday'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VITRIOLIC attack on the Maastricht treaty by Lady Thatcher last night
shattered Mr John Major's hopes that divisions over Europe had been put to
rest at the Tory party conference.
After a day in which Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, had
led a succession of cabinet ministers in backing the prime minister's
stance, Lady Thatcher derided Maastricht as a 'vision of the past'.
She repudiated the European exchange rate mechanism as a 'ruinous
straitjacket'.
Her scathing intervention on the eve of her appearance alongside her
successor on the platform in Brighton drew an angrily curt response from the
prime minister. He told reporters: 'It is a matter for her, not me . . . I
will address government policy on Friday, the policy which has the cabinet's
complete and unanimous support.'
Lady Thatcher, who indicated last week that she had no intention of
disrupting the conference, used an article in today's issue of The European
newspaper to do just that: 'It is time to get our priorities right. The
government must recognise that Maastricht, like the ERM, is part of the
vision of yesterday. It is time to set out the vision for tomorrow.'
Lady Thatcher also brushed aside the policy initiative, expected to be
presented by Mr Major later this month at the Birmingham summit, when she
insisted that enhanced language on 'subsidiarity' - the devolution of
community powers to nation states - would not be sufficient to make the
treaty viable.
Her joint appearance with Mr Major on the platform this morning now
threatens an uncomfortable test of the loyalties of party activists who
earlier this week cheered a similar attack on Maastricht delivered by Lord
Tebbit.
It also risks overshadowing Mr Norman Lamont's efforts in a speech today to
reassure financial markets that he will put in place a coherent economic
strategy to replace membership of the ERM.
Senior ministers said Lady Thatcher's comments had been deliberately timed
to undermine Mr Major's authority. One member of the cabinet said she had
become 'twisted and embittered' since her departure from Downing Street.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, echoed that sentiment with a reminder
that it was Lady Thatcher who had taken sterling into the ERM: 'How can a
former prime minister come along and attack her successor about a decision
in which she was the senior partner?'
He was joined by Mr Heseltine who reminded the former prime minister she had
taken Britain further into Europe: 'She had to make the lonely decisions in
power. And every time she had to make them she took us deeper and further
into Europe.'
Sir Edward Heath, another former Tory prime minister, spoke more bluntly:
'She hates Europe, she hates all Europeans.'
Sir Edward also called for the resignation of three unnamed members of the
cabinet for failing to endorse fully Mr Major's pro-Maastricht stance.
Earlier Mr Heseltine had confronted critics of Maastricht at the conference
in an effortlessly barnstorming speech which won him an enthusiastic ovation
from grassroots activists.
Insisting that membership of the Community was in Britain's 'national
self-interest' he warned of the threat to inward investment and the City of
London if Britain left the mainstream of Europe. 'If you want to hand that
over to the Germans and the French, all you have to do is see us
marginalised on the periphery of Europe.'
Mr Lamont, one of the least enthusiastic Europeans in the cabinet, joined
the defence of Maastricht by rejecting suggestions that it was a blueprint
for a federal Europe.
He emphasised that the treaty not only enshrined the principle of
'subsidiarity' or minimum interference by the European Commission, but also
set out a framework of intergovernmental co-operation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIAN officials yesterday painted an apocalyptic picture of a country so
full of chemical and organic toxins that even if all pollution were
miraculously to stop today, the Russian people would be stunted for the next
quarter century.
'We have already doomed ourselves for the next 25 years,' Mr Vladimir
Pokrovsky, head of the Academy of Medical Sciences, told a news conference
called to publicise the Russian government's first full revelations of the
damage done to health and the environment by 70 years of communist rule.
The figures cited by Russia's top scientists and environmental politicians
were numbing. In a reversal unprecedented in industrialised countries, Mr
Pokrovsky predicted that diseases in pregnant women would rise from 83 in
1,000 to 110 in 1,000 in coming years.
Widespread ignorance of contraceptives, which are hard to obtain and used by
only one woman in five, resulted in 3.5m abortions at state hospitals last
year - 2.5 times more than the number of births.
Some 40 per cent of hospitals did not have hot water, while an additional 12
per cent had no water at all.
Russian infants fare no better after they are born, with 11 per cent of
infants suffering birth defects. They become more ill as they grow and about
55 per cent of schoolchildren suffer health problems.
Their health is worsened by the water they drink, half of which is
contaminated by chemical and organic toxins, according to Mr Evgeni Beliaev,
chief Russian health inspector. He said 10 per cent of food was unhealthy to
eat.
Russians are also dying sooner. Life expectancy fell in 1992 to 69 years for
women and 63 for men, a drop from 1991 figures of 74 years for women and 64
for men. The 25-40 age group is hardest hit by illness and early death.
Nuclear power, according Mr Viktor Danilov-Danilian, the Russian minister
for the environment, poses a greater threat than was previously believed. He
said that the VVR reactors, which make up most of Russia's nuclear power
capacity and which have been considered more safe than the RBMK-type reactor
at Chernobyl, are actually the most dangerous.
Mr Danilov-Danilian was critical of what he described as a weak western
reaction to his nation's woes. The only western environmental aid of note,
he said, was an offer by Norway and Finland to pay Dollars 100m to refit two
nickel plants near their border. But he said Russia would need to contribute
Dollars 550m to make a go of the project, money that Mr Danilov-Danilian
believes could be better spent elsewhere.

FT  08 OCT 92 / Patten's plans for Hong Kong reform irritate Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMBITIOUS PLANS for demo-cratic reform in Hong Kong were unveiled yesterday
by Mr Chris Patten, the colony's governor, to the irritation of China and a
mixed reception locally.
Opening the 1992-93 session of the Legislative Council, the local
legislature, Mr Patten made proposals that would lead to a significant
increase in the level of democratic representation at elections due in 1995.
Xinhua News Agency, China's unofficial embassy in Hong Kong, which was
briefed by Mr Patten on Tuesday, last night accused the governor of ignoring
confidentiality, and of irresponsibility.
It said Britain had ignored a request from China that the plans should be
agreed with Beijing before they were unveiled. It warned that China would
not be held responsible for any controversy arising from the unilateral
publication of his plans.
In addition to political development, Mr Patten outlined a multi-billion
Hong Kong-dollar spending programme to improve social welfare and education,
and to address the colony's pressing environmental problems.
He announced the creation of a Hong Kong Monetary Authority which will
result from the merger of the Office of the Exchange Fund - which manages
the colony's foreign exchange reserves and sets interest rates - and the
office of the Banking Commissioner.
Mr Patten flies to Beijing in two weeks to discuss his plans with the
Chinese leadership.
Mr Martin Lee, a prominent liberal who leads Hong Kong's United Democrats,
said Mr Patten had taken the easy way out. Splitting the executive from the
legislature was 'retrograde'.
'What he should have done - the right and honourable thing to do - is give
us full democracy now and use the next four-and-a-half years to convince
China,' Mr Lee said. 'Poll after poll shows that Hong Kong people want
democracy although they know China would not approve.'
Mr Patten's plan does not include an increase in the number of directly
elected seats to the legislative council - 20 in 1995. But it would lead to
a significant increase in the level of democratic representation by
broadening the franchise for the remaining 40 seats in the legislature.
However, Mr Patten said he would continue to press Beijing to accept a
greater number of directly elected members of the Legislative Council.
'The pace of democratisation in Hong Kong is, we all know, necessarily
constrained,' he said. 'But it is constrained, not stopped dead in its
tracks.'
The political blueprint will have to be discussed with China, but the
governor said his ideas were consistent with the Basic Law - the colony's
Beijing-drafted mini-constitution that comes into effect at the end of
British rule in 1997 - and followed consultation with the colony's political
and community leaders.
Mr Patten said his proposals struck a balance between the democratic
aspirations of Hong Kong's people and 'the implacable realities of history,
geography and economics (which) determine the way in which such views can be
applied,' he said.
The governor also reshuffled his Executive Council, or quasi-cabinet, and
outlined ways in which the Legislative Council could become more effective
in monitoring the business of government. He promised more openness and
offered to appear before the council each month to take legislators'
questions on government policy.
Underlining the UK government's support for Mr Patten's plans, Mr John
Major, the prime minister, said he fully endorsed the governor's proposals
'which represent the best way forward for Hong Kong'.

<TEXT>
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's liberal and conservative allies quarrelled
yesterday over how to curb the right-wing violence which has struck Germany,
Reuter reports from Bonn. The liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) protested
against conservative calls for stiffer laws, believing existing laws strong
enough to deal with an eruption of racist and anti-Semitic attacks.
In turn, Mr Kohl's allies in the Christian Social Union attacked the FDP for
opposing moves to scrap Germany's generous political asylum law and halt an
influx of refugees. Bonn announced plans to reassign 1,300 federal
bureaucrats and 200 retired military officers to help process a backlog of
over 400,000 requests for asylum.

FT  08 OCT 92 / UK Company News: F&amp;C launches trust to attract PEP investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN &amp; Colonial, manager of the UK's largest investment trust, yesterday
launched a trust aimed at attracting personal equity plan investors.
The PEP Investment Trust (Pepit) has a simple capital structure consisting
only of ordinary shares and will be primarily marketed as a qualifying trust
for PEPs.
The trust is being launched through an offer for subscription, which means
the issue is not underwritten. However, F&amp;C says the minimum of Pounds 17m
has already been raised. The offer period closes at noon on October 23.
F&amp;C's international general trust, the UK's largest, has total assets of
Pounds 1.1bn. However, due to regulations which require trusts to keep more
than 50 per cent of their assets in the European Community to qualify for
the Pounds 6,000 yearly allowance, the international general trust is
limited to Pounds 1,500.
The new Pepit will hold about 80 per cent of its stock in the UK, mostly in
companies drawn from the FT-SE 100 index and the rest in Europe, allowing
investors to take advantage of the full Pounds 6,000 allowance.
The offer price per share is 100p and the maximum number of shares in issue
following the offer will be 99.8m.
The investment is balanced between capital and income growth. The annualised
gross dividend yield is estimated at 4.5 per cent.
The initial charge is 2.5 per cent, compared to the industry average of
between 5 and 6 per cent and the annual management charge is 0.4 per cent.
Pepit will have an indefinite life.

THE ELECTION for future presidents of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in England and Wales will be more democratic than ever before, its ruling
council decided yesterday.
In the first council meeting to be opened to the public, the members
defeated moves to ban canvassing and keep secret the results of voting for
the vice-president, who becomes president automatically after two years.
The monthly meetings of the council have been made public after a debate
over greater accountability within the institute. Voting will continue to be

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Gillette's bid for Parker Pen referred to
MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission the
proposed Pounds 285m purchase of Parker Pen by Gillette, the US razor,
stationery and toiletries manufacturer.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, said the deal,
announced last month, raised competition concerns in the supply of
refillable writing instruments and refills. The MMC has until January 13 to
report.
Gillette already owns pen makers Paper Mate and Waterman. According to some
estimates, acquisition of Parker could give Gillette more than half the UK
market for refillable pens and pencils, worth more than Pounds 100m a year.
Some retailers are understood to have expressed concern that such a strong
position could enable Parker to restrict choice and raise prices in a mature
product market where heavy advertising and brand support deter new entrants.
No new competitors are believed to have entered the UK market for at least
five years. Other leading suppliers of refillable pens and pencils are
Sheaffer, Cross, Mont Blanc, Elysee and Pentel.
Gillette's proposed acquisition of Parker, which has been based in the UK
since a Dollars 100m management buy-out from its US parent in 1985, is
subject to regulatory approval in Britain, France and the US.
Gillette is already under pressure from competition authorities in Britain,
Germany and several other countries to dispose of its interest in Eemland,
the parent company of Wilkinson Sword, Gillette's main competitor in wet
shaving products.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GEMINA, the Italian investment and financial services group controlled by
Fiat, raised group net profits marginally to L157bn (Dollars 119.4m) for the
year to June 30 from L152.5bn in 1990-91.
Net earnings at parent company level fell heavily to L42.7bn from L101.5bn,
largely on account of a L112.2bn write-down in the value of Gemina's stakes
in quoted companies.
The company is paying an unchanged dividend of L60 for ordinary shares and
L70 for savings stock. The payment, which exceeds the parent company's
profits, will be made using funds from a special reserve. The group
confirmed its intention to sell its stake of over 13 per cent in Banco
Ambrosiano Veneto, Italy's biggest private sector financial institution.
However, the group made no mention of the widely-expected sale of its equity
and bond trading subsidiary to Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, the large
treasury-owned bank.

GTE and Bell Canada, respectively the biggest local telephone companies in
the US and Canada, are to co-operate in selling their billing and other
information services to telephone utilities in other countries.
The two groups see lucrative opportunities in improving the billing systems
of recently-privatised telephone companies whose customers have up to now
received only rudimentary accounts with little information on individual
calls.
Mr Don Hayes, president of GTE Data Services, a subsidiary, said yesterday
that government-owned utilities 'haven't been motivated to be responsive to
the customer'.
GTE Data Services already has contracts in the Netherlands, Denmark and
Puerto Rico. Mr Hayes said the company was also in discussions with British
Telecom, an Italian phone company, and the Mexican telephone utility.
Bell, a unit of BCE Inc of Montreal, has been looking for ways to forge
links with foreign telecommunications companies as the domestic market
becomes more competitive.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Tesco executive attacks 'second-rate' suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN BRADLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF Britain's food manufacturers are second-rate, out of touch with
consumers and heading for failure, according to a senior executive with a
leading supermarket chain.
Mr David Robey, Tesco's director of corporate marketing, shocked members at
a recent meeting of the Institute of Practitioners of Advertising with his
candid and virulent attack on suppliers.
Mr Robey said many deserved to fail because of their poor marketing
practices. He said a raft of inferior 'me-too' brand names had sprung up in
recent years.
Mr Robey said second-rate suppliers failed to understand the needs of
consumers and conducted their marketing activities from 'ivory towers' from
which they 'flattered the egos of clients'.
Industry experts said Mr Robey's remarks were part of the growing discontent
among large supermarkets with many British suppliers.
Mr Alan Mitchell, editor of Marketing magazine, who highlighted the comments
on LBC radio, said last night: 'It is quite unprecedented for such a senior
marketer with a major multiple to say these things in such an abrasive
fashion in public.'
Tesco declined to comment on Mr Robey's remarks.
Mr Robey qualified his comments by saying that not all suppliers were
second-rate.
He said there were numerous quality manufacturers in the food and cosmetic
sectors. But a tier of 'second-rate' manufacturers had sprung up which
failed on a number of scores including value for money.

efforts to become a world financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRANKFURT Stock Exchange, the largest in Germany, will today announce
that it has reached agreement with the country's seven other exchanges to
form Deutsche Borse - a single exchange for Germany.
The agreement, which has taken three years to put together, will be heralded
as a vital step in the campaign to turn Frankfurt into an international
financial centre to rival London, New York and Tokyo.
Other reforms to bolster the standing of Germany's stock market have been
delayed.
For legal and other reasons, reforms promoted by Mr Theo Waigel, the finance
minister, will not be completed until at least the end of next year, 12
months later than planned.
These include the introduction of an insider dealing law, the creation of a
supervisory body for the securities industry, new shareholding disclosure
rules and more sophisticated electronic share trading.
The announcement of agreement on a national German stock market comes 10
months after Mr Waigel urged its creation as part of an ambitious package of
measures designed to strengthen 'Finanzplatz Deutschland' - Germany as a
financial centre.
Protracted wrangling between Frankfurt and the smaller exchanges in recent
years had slowed the development of the preoject.
German financiers hope that the move will in time reduce the costs of
dealing in the German equity market and enhance liquidity, thereby winning
back some of the sizeable amount of business in German shares that is
carried out in other financial centres, predominantly London. Up to 10 per
cent of turnover in some large German companies is routinely conducted in
London.
Deutsche Borse will be based on the present Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Under the agreement, the seven smaller stock exchanges - in Dusseldorf,
Munich, Hamburg, Stuttgart, Berlin, Hanover and Bremen - will buy 10 per
cent of a new holding company and be given a total of four seats on an
enlarged supervisory board.
The holding company will also buy the Deutsche Terminborse - the German
screen-based futures and options exchange - and acquire the Deutsche
Kassen-verein, an independent body which handles securities settlement.
Mr Rolf Breuer, head of capital markets at Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest
bank, will take over as chairman of the supervisory board when the structure
takes effect in January.
Mr Friedrich von Metzler will step down as chairman of the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange.

FT  07 OCT 92 / People: Barber for Invesco MIM in UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The new chief executive of the UK unit trust arm of Invesco MIM is Stephen
Barber, who returned in May after five years with the group in Tokyo having
clocked up some notable successes in helping to break into the protected
world of Japanese fund management.
Barber arrives at a time when the British unit trust industry is
exceptionally depressed, and as Invesco MIM, as a group, is fighting to
re-establish credibility after its involvement with Maxwell and the
investment trust Drayton Consolidated. Lord Stevens recently stepped down as
chief executive of Invesco, to be replaced by Charles Brady, who is
understood to be putting in place a generally less high-risk investment
strategy.
Nicholas Johnson, responsible for all the group's business outside America,
had previously also been chief executive of Invesco MIM Unit Trust Managers,
with Barber's appointment (made before Lord Stevens stepped down) reflecting
a desire to strengthen the operating heads of individual divisions.
Barber, 37, a fluent Japanese speaker who spent one Christmas holiday in
Tokyo translating 50 pages of domestic investment trust industry rules from
Japanese into English, helped Invesco MIM this year to become the first
foreign firm to win a Japanese corporate pension account, and the group is
also now the largest of just four foreign firms licensed to sell investment
trusts.
Retail investors have not necessarily been deterred by Invesco's highly
publicised problems, Barber contends; recent surveys of independent
financial advisers show 'extremely low levels of awareness'. His main
priority, however, is a defensive one - 'to retain business' - and to build
as conditions improve. He thinks lessons learnt in Japan - notably that
'client is king' - will help in defining a modified UK approach.
Barber has had to wait until now to gain regulatory approval for his
appointment - a process slowed by the fact that he had been out of the
country since the vast body of new securities regulation had been
implemented in the UK.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Ford faces challenge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD yesterday appeared to be facing a challenge by dealers to its rules
preventing them from selling rival makes of car within 30 miles of any Ford
outlets they operate.
A potential showdown has been triggered by the decision of Currie Motors, a
hitherto Ford-only London dealer group, to cut its ties with Ford rather
than have its plans to develop into a multi-franchise group frustrated.
Currie's move was being seen within the trade as offering encouragement to
other groups to prepare their own challenges to the Ford restrictions.
Meanwhile, Mr Peter Vardy, chairman of north-east dealer group Reg Vardy,
whose operations include two Ford dealerships, has met Sir Leon Brittan, the
EC competition commissioner, to urge that the Commission press on with moves
to eradicate manufacturers' restrictions on dealer competition.
Even though Ford has made clear that all agreements on Currie outlets would
be terminated, Currie has served notice to Ford that it is switching six of
its dealerships to selling other makes, starting on November 1.

environment

<TEXT>
ALTRON, the diversified South African electronics, information technology
and power electrical group, overcame a difficult operating environment to
record an 8 per cent increase in earnings in the six months to the end of
August.
Although turnover remained steady at R1.3bn (Dollars 461m), pressure on
margins caused operating income to fall to R130.4m from R141.5m a year
earlier. But significantly higher interest income, at R12.8m compared with
R7m, coupled with lower outside shareholders' interest and a higher
contribution from non-consolidated subsidiaries, saw attributable earnings
rise to R48.8m from R45.1m.
Earnings per share rose by 8 per cent to 257 cents from 238 cents. A single
annual dividend is declared at the end of the financial year.
Mr Bill Venter, chairman, said the main three operating divisions - Altech,
Fintech and Powertech - had performed soundly, despite the depressed economy
and extensive labour and political unrest. Earnings rose slightly at Altech,
fell by 9 per cent at Powertech and were 30 per cent ahead at Fintech.
Mr Venter said Altron's export focus was producing benefits and order books
were up.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Sappi moves ahead 19% on rights
issue interest
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST on the income of a R1bn (Dollars 355m) rights issue last year
helped Sappi, the South African-based forest products company in the Gencor
group, lift earnings by 19 per cent in the first six months to the end of
August.
These figures disguise the extremely difficult operating conditions the
group faces. Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, says the pulp and paper
industry is facing its worst recession in 60 years.
Thus, although Sappi was able to lift turnover by 14 per cent to R2.02bn
from R1.78bn a year earlier, operating income fell by 14 per cent to R221.2m
from R257.1m.
The big fillip came in the form of a 96 per cent fall in net financing costs
to R4.5m from R126.4m in 1991 owing to the interest receipts from the rights
issue. This helped boost net profits by 71 per cent to R175.1m from R102.4m.
A 44 per cent increase in the average number of shares in issue, however,
limited growth in earnings per share to 19 per cent - up to 130 cents from
110 cents. The dividend was maintained at 80 cents per share.
Highlights of the reporting period include the acquisition of a 90 per cent
stake in Hannover Papier, a German coated fine paper manufacturer. The deal
was partially financed through a placing of Sappi paper in Europe, and the
group's subsequent listing in London, Frankfurt and Paris.
Trading figures for this acquisition are not included in the current
results, but the balance sheet reflects, on a consolidated basis, previously
equity accounted subsidiaries of Sappi and Hannover.
Mr Van As said productivity had improved at all the group's units; cost
increases in South Africa and the UK had been kept below inflation; capital
expenditure had slowed sharply; and there had been a significant
restructuring of the UK operation.

SHIMIZU, a leading Japanese building contractor, plans to sell four UK
office buildings and close two UK subsidiaries as part of a restructuring of
international operations that will lessen its role as a developer of new
projects.
The company, under pressure in markets at home and abroad, will also close
two Australian subsidiaries and plans to announce extraordinary losses of
Y72.9bn (Dollars 609m) for the year to the end of March. However, Shimizu
still expects a pre-tax profit of Y125bn, though that may be revised.
S. C. Properties (UK), S. C. Investment (UK), Shimizu Australia and S. C.
Properties (Australia) are likely to be closed, though Shimizu emphasised it
would still have a role as a contractor in both markets.
Like most other Japanese construction companies, Shimizu will be more
selective about capital participation in UK building projects. The company
would not identify which buildings are to be sold, although Japanese
newspapers reported that it was expecting a loss of Y27.5bn on the sales.
'We never expected that the worldwide recession would be so serious. This
recession is the cause of the closures,' Shimizu said. 'In the future, we
will have to be more cautious about involvement as developers. We don't want
to stop being a developer, but we will be more careful.'
Apart from empty buildings in foreign markets, Shimizu has been bruised by
the downturn in the domestic property market. Building orders for the
Japanese industry fell 15 per cent last year, and 31.5 per cent in the
second quarter this year, compared with the same period last year.
Japanese contractors hope the recently-announced emergency economic package
will stimulate the property market, while orders for public works investment
is due to increase in coming months, providing extra sales for the
construction industry.
Other Japanese developers, including Kumagai Gumi, Daikyo and EIE
International, have scaled down their European and Australian operations and
are attempting to sell buildings in these troubled markets. The companies
expanded their international exposure in the mid-1980s, and their ambitions
were fuelled by the ease of raising funds in an overheated domestic market
in the late 1980s.

BFr4.47bn in first half

NET profits at Societe Generale de Belgique, Belgium's largest holding
company, slipped from BFr4.81bn (Dollars 164m) to BFr4.47bn in the first
half of 1992.
However, profits before extraordinary gains - current profits - rose sharply
from last year's trough.
Before extraordinary gains, the group made profits of BFr3.64bn - still
short of the 1990 interim figure of BFr4.6bn, but more than double the 1991
interim figure of BFr1.47bn.
Mr Etienne Davignon, La Generale's chairman, said the group was still
expecting to improve current profits for 1992, in spite of the continued
economic depression.
He also hinted that the group would want to take advantage of its stronger
financial position. 'We have no intention of just sitting here and being
happy about the good results - you can bet that we will be active in the
future,' he said.
'The changes in the current profits are not due to external economic forces,
but mainly due to the (improved) management of the company,' he said.
La Generale's share of current profits from services groups - such as
Generale de Banque, the Belgian bank, and Tractebel, the electricity, gas
and communications company - increased from BFr2.79bn to BFr4.07bn in the
first half. Mr Gerard Mestrallet, La Generale's managing director, said that
Tractebel would announce improved interim profits today.
But industrial subsidiaries contributed only BFr472m of profit, against
BFr50m of losses in the first half of 1991.
Exceptional gains of BFr830m (down from BFr3.34bn) mainly reflected proceeds
from the sale of La Generale's shares in Wagons-Lits to Accor, the French
hotels company.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Poor relations in the Clark family - The
feud at Britain's biggest shoe maker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clark family is, by nature, publicity shy. So the events of the past
weeks at C&amp;J Clark, Britain's largest shoe manufacturer, have come as an
unwelcome intrusion into what many regard as a family affair.
The latest salvo in the family feud was fired this week with a letter to
shareholders setting out reasons why Mr Walter Dickson, the recently
appointed chairman, and Mr James Power, a non-executive director, should be
ousted at next week's extraordinary meeting.
The letter, compiled by the four family members who sit on the Clark board,
will cite falling profits and a loss of confidence in Mr Dickson as the
reasons for the rebellion.
However, there is likely to be a strong emotional appeal to the 500 members
of the Clark family, who control some 70 per cent of the company.
The appeal will be given added urgency by the news of a possible bid
approach backed by Electra Investments, the venture capital specialists. The
deal being discussed involves Clark's management consultant, Mr Colin
Fisher, making an offer of about Pounds 150m - backed by Electra and other
institutions. Mr Fisher is believed to be seeking a more flexible
shareholder base, with control in the hands of institutions, in preparation
for expansion and eventual flotation.
It is clear some family members are smarting at the attempt to wrest control
of the company from its traditional base. Not only by the possible bidders,
but by increasing influence of non-family members in the company.
Mr Dickson, who became chairman in May, is the first non-family member to
head the company since the brothers Cyrus and James Clark set up shop in
their father's farm in Somerset some 167 years ago. It is almost certain
that if a bid was made by Mr Fisher, and accepted, Mr Dickson would remain
chairman.
The vital question now is whether the majority of the Clark family actually
cares if it loses control. Many of the 500 family members are only distantly
related to the founding brothers. In fact, only about 10 are direct
descendants of Cyrus, with the vast majority owing their stakes to the
younger brother James.
For many of the Clark shareholders, the company's private status is
inconvenient. Many want to sell, but the matched bargain basis on which the
shares trade - at a current price of 128p, valuing Clark at Pounds 100m -
makes this awkward.
Even the 'requisitionists', as the rebel directors are named for calling the
egm, have admitted some of the family want to sell shares. Several family
members have more pressing needs for the cash, not the least being losses in
the Lloyd's insurance market.
A mechanism to buy them out is being explored by the requisitionists,
although no decision has been taken.
For many shareholders, who depend on the Clark dividend for their income the
final straw was a 50 per cent cut in this year's interim pay-out from 7p to
3.5p. That reduction followed a 20 per cent decrease for the whole of last
year.
The cuts were made to pay for the company's wide-ranging restructuring
programme. The latest stage of the restructuring was announced only this
week, with the closure of the original shoe factory in Street, Somerset.
Clark now runs nine factories, almost half of what it had in the heyday of
the 1970s.
The UK shoe industry has taken a severe beating from the dramatic growth of
cheaper imports. According to the British Footwear Manufacturers'
Association, the average price of a pair of shoes from China is Pounds 1.75,
compared with Pounds 8.45 in Britain. Since 1987, the volume of imports has
risen by 50 per cent - and even more in the most recent years of recession
when price has become all-important.
Seven out of every 10 pairs of shoes purchased in Britain comes from abroad.
UK manufacturers cannot hope to compete unless they source from abroad, as
Clark is increasingly doing. Yet Clark still makes more than 60 per cent of
its shoes in the UK, more than any other British company. The company's
defence against imports is its strength in the children's shoe sector, where
they have had less effect. Against such a background it is not surprising
that Clark has seen operating profits tumble from Pounds 39m to Pounds 28m
on sales of Pounds 594m (Pounds 606m) for the year to January 1992.
The recent boardroom split only heightens the company's difficulties and
employees are beginning to feel the strain. 'It is like one of those
management games,' said one who preferred to remain anonymous. 'Someone
keeps handing you problem cards and saying 'now, you deal with that'.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / US accuses Unita rebels of violating deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION mounted yesterday between the US and Unita, the Angolan rebel
movement, as the group continued to threaten to derail the country's peace
process after suffering defeat in its first democratic elections.
The US yesterday accused the movement, previously supported by the US and
South Africa, of violating the country's superpower-brokered peace accords
after saying it was withdrawing its forces from the new unified army to
protest at alleged electoral fraud.
Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary of state for African affairs,
criticised Unita's decision to pull out of the integrated Angolan Armed
Forces (FAA). 'This is an unfortunate step which is not in accord with the
spirit or letter of the Angola peace accords (signed in May 1991 in
Portugal),' he said. Senior officials of Unita dismissed Mr Cohen's
statement and warned him not to interfere.
Unita's withdrawal from the FAA, combined with its increasingly aggressive
rhetoric and its disregard for international opinion, raised the prospect of
plunging the vast country back into instability.
Diplomats said they were frustrated by Unita's failure to stay within the
peace process and concerned that Mr Jonas Savimbi, Unita's mercurial leader,
was refusing to see foreigners, including the US observer and the special
representative of the UN secretary-general.
A statement issued at midnight on Monday by Gen Arlindo ing Chenda Pena,
joint commander of the FAA, said Unita felt betrayed by the government and
was quitting the force until three conditions were met: a review or
cancellation of the electoral process, a ban on the National Electoral
Commission issuing further results and consideration of 'intimidation'
during polling by the anti-riot police.
'We are ready to return to FAA as soon as serious negotiations are
undertaken between the MPLA government and the Unita leadership with all the
genuine opposition leading to a solution of the present national crisis,'
Gen Pena said.
The National Electoral Commission said yesterday it would not issue final
results until tomorrow. However, official returns from 85 per cent of the
vote show President Jose Eduardo dos Santos leading Mr Savimbi by 50.8 per
cent to 39.4 per cent.

THE DANISH government and the country's central bank have made DKr500m

second biggest bank, Sjovinnubankin.
The bank lost DKr415m in the first eight months of this year. Its share
capital has been written down from DKr98m to DKr15m. A condition of the
Danish rescue is that the islands' government presents a balanced budget for
1993 and prepares an economic stabilisation programme.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Old fears erupt along Japanese fault lines: Last year's
volcano victims are still suffering
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVENTY-year-old Mrs Shizue Kanegae's home escaped destruction when Mount
Unzen erupted last year. The bad news is that her house will have to come
down when a dam is built to halt the mudslides from the volcano on Kyushu
island, off southern Japan.
'Life will not be the same again,' sighs Mrs Kanegae, a farmer, and one of
the 6,054 people who are now living in one-room prefabricated huts provided
by the local government.
Unzen's explosion evoked one of the deepest fears of Japanese, who live in
fear of earthquakes and volcanoes since the country lies on a fault line in
the earth's crust. The death of 43 people and the destruction of rice
fields, homes, and schools by the lava and hot ash perpetuated feelings of
vulnerability.
Some 15,000 were killed the last time Mount Unzen erupted in 1792. The
volcano is still active, spewing out lava at least once a day. Lava domes
are still growing, although specialists believe that large scale eruptions
are unlikely for the time being.
'It will take more than 10 years for everything to return to normal again,'
says Mr Kanichi Kanegae, mayor of Shimabara City, which lies at the foot of
Mount Unzen.
'However, we're dealing with nature and there are limits to what we can do.'
The eruption, which caused estimated damage of Y124bn (Dollars 1.03bn), has
brought the local economies of Shimabara and its neighbouring town of Fukae
to a halt. The designation of the populated areas as danger warning zones,
prohibiting public entry, has hurt the area's tobacco farming, sewing
factories, and tourism.
In the danger zones, houses are deserted and overgrown grass and weeds cover
the unkept gardens. Tattered decorations from the New Year flutter from an
empty farmhouse rooftop. Bulldozers and trucks raise dust storms, as they
clear away the debris left by the most recent mudslides.
To the frustration of the evacuees and others affected by the volcanic
eruption, the government does not provide direct financial aid to
individuals.
So far, calls from the residents for a special law to aid restructuring have
been rejected. However, donations totalling Y16.1bn have supported the
evacuees, as the disaster has evoked sympathy in the Japanese people.
While office workers who commute to the neighbouring cities were quick to
return to their jobs, unemployment for farmers who have lost their fields
has presented problems.
Trying to find new jobs for those in the agricultural industry is proving to
be the most difficult task for the local authorities. 'It's hard to convince
farmers, who have a strong affinity to their land, to move and change the
way of living at the same time,' explains an official of the Nagasaki
prefectural government.
Local authorities are intent on easing restrictions limiting entry into the
danger zones and the construction of a dam preventing the spreading of
future mudslides. Some 300 homes are planned to be removed to make way for
the construction of 120 protective dams and embankments.
Mrs Kanegae says her son, who has been working on a construction site in
Osaka since the eruption, will no longer have a house to come back to. 'I
can't sleep at night when I think of the mountain and our future,' she says.

Mr Volwiler was hired by Abbott in 1917. He was the north Chicago company's
chief chemist from 1920 to 1930, its president from 1950 to 1958 and
chairman from 1958 to 1959.
In 1930 he and another chemist developed Nembutal, a barbiturate that could
induce sleep within 20 minutes with little or no side-effects. The chemists
also developed sodium pentothal, or truth serum, in 1936.

ARMED soldiers and policemen patrolled sections of Georgetown, Guyana's
capital, yesterday following rioting and looting as votes cast in Monday's
presidential election were being counted.
Two people were killed and almost 200 arrested in the violence which began
when supporters of the ruling People's National Congress (PNC) party
attacked the offices of the independent Elections Commission, claiming they
were being prevented from voting.
The commission's offices were damaged, and mobs then fanned out to other
parts of the city and began looting. An attempted attack on the headquarters
of the opposition People's Progressive party (PPP) was thwarted when the
building was cordoned off by police.
Mr Desmond Hoyte, the president, said he 'empathised' with the complaints of
his supporters but he did not condone the violence. He then called out the
army to support the police.
Initial returns yesterday indicated a close race between Mr Hoyte's PNC and
the PPP, led by Dr Cheddi Jagan.
Mr Hoyte has campaigned on a platform of continued deregulation of the
state-controlled economy. Dr Jagan is promising to reduce the pace of
deregulation but says he is also keen to encourage foreign investment.
The country's racial mix is a significant factor in the politics of the
English-speaking republic of 900,000 people. The PNC is generally supported
by Afro-Guyanese, while the majority Indo-Guyanese have tended to favour the
PPP.
The violence has cast doubt on the completion of what is widely held to be
the country's first fair elections in thirty years.

<TEXT>
INTEL, the leading US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday announced plans
for a Dollars 400m manufacturing plant at the site of its California
headquarters. The plant will be the first new large-scale semiconductor
production facility to be built in the area for several years.
In recent years many California chip makers have located new plants outside
the high-tech region in areas with lower land prices and fewer regulatory
barriers. This trend has raised concerns about the 'hollowing' of Silicon
Valley.
Intel already owned the site of its new plant and gained the co-operation of
state and local officials in accelerating the complex process of obtaining
environmental and other permits for construction.
The Intel expansion will add 250 new jobs. Production is due to begin in the
third quarter of 1993. The plant had previously been used for research and
development and will be expanded to include a mass production facility.
Intel will make microprocessors and related chips at the new factory.

CZECH AND Slovak political leaders yesterday agreed to continue working
toward the division of the Czechoslovak federal state, defusing the
political crisis brought about by the recent Slovak about-face.
After eight hours of negotiations late last night, Mr Vaclav Klaus, the
Czech prime minister, and Mr Vladimir Meciar, his Slovak counterpart, issued
a joint statement.
They confirmed earlier agreements which aim to create two independent Czech
and Slovak republics by next January 1.
The statement calmed mounting fears that the country was heading toward
political paralysis, with both Czech and Slovak leaders standing at opposite
ends as regards the fate of the federal state.
In a surprise move in the federal parliament last Thursday night, Slovak
nationalists had succeeded, with the support of the Czech opposition
parties, in pushing through a motion to draw up plans for a new union
between the Slovak and Czech republics.
Such a possibility has always been categorically rejected by Mr Klaus.
However, Mr Meciar and his party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia
(HZDS), last night went back on its proposal for a union.
'The HZDS respects the idea that it is impossible to transform the current
federation into a confederation or a union,' the statement said.
Difficult compromises remain to be reached, though, over the practical
aspects of the divorce.
So far no agreements have appeared over the methods to be used in dividing
federal properties.
The Czech side is refusing to accept the financial compensations requested
by Slovak negotiators.

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S minority Labour government yesterday unveiled a draft 1993 budget
proposing a record NKr49.2bn (Pounds 5bn) deficit.
The budget relies heavily on oil revenues to finance the welfare state,
despite a shaky outlook for the economy.
The deficit is NKr8bn greater than last year. The budget includes cuts in
some price subsidies, saving NKr730m; and defence cuts of NKr540m. Overall
spending in 1993 would rise 5.4 per cent to NKr371bn while income rises 3.5
per cent to NKr322bn.
Norway's net borrowing requirement will rise to NKr58bn in 1993 from a
forecast NKr41bn in 1992.
The government is proposing to cut the dividend paid by Statoil, the
Norwegian state oil company, to NKr1.25bn in 1993 from NKr1.4bn set for
1992.
Daily average oil and gas production is forecast to rise sharply to 2.3m
barrels in 1996 from 1.9m in 1991.
The increased output will boost revenue from the petroleum sector by 14.4
per cent, or NKr4.25bn to NKr33.82bn in 1993, based on an oil price of
NKr127 a barrel.
Economic growth is put at only 1.5 per cent in 1993, compared with an
estimated 2.5 per cent this year.

Bulgaria made its first Dollars 10m current interest payment on its Dollars
10bn commercial bank debt since its former Communist rulers stopped paying
interest and principal in 1990, officials said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Sofia.
'Our first payment of some Dollars 10m covers about one quarter of the
current interest for September,' Mr Svetoslav Gavriiski, chief of Bulgaria's
foreign debt commission, said.
The next current interest payment for the coming three months would be made
by the end of this year, Mr Gavriiski said.

NIGERIA'S military rulers yesterday suspended the process of choosing
candidates for December's presidential elections pending the outcome of a
probe into alleged irregularities, Reuter reports from Abuja.
The Armed Forces Ruling Council (AFRC) said after a meeting that the
decision followed a report by the National Electoral Commission on
presidential primaries between September 12 and 26.
'The AFRC has found it necessary to put the primaries and presidential
candidates' nomination processes on hold until all allegations of use of
wealth, falsification of figures, threats, favouritism and all other
electoral malpractices indentified in the NEC report have been thoroughly
investigated and verified,' it said.
Rigging charges following the primaries of the Social Democratic party (SDP)
and National Republican Convention (NRC) - both created by the government -
have cast a shadow over President Ibrahim Babangida's plans to step down on
January 2 after the December 5 presidential election.

MR Ralph Nader and officials of 11 consumer and environmental groups
yesterday said Nafta was 'so detrimental' the US Congress might be forced to
reject it. They expressed disappointment that Mr Bill Clinton, the
Democratic presidential candidate, had decided not to send the pact back for
renegotiation if elected.
'Clinton does offer an alternative plan that tries to solve environmental
concerns,' said Mr Michael McCloskey, chairman of the Sierra Club. 'Unlike
George Bush, he is willing to link Nafta's successful completion with
environmental safeguards.' The groups challenged the administration's claim
that Nafta was the 'greenest' trade pact.
Criticisms included:
Nafta rests on an assumption that trade will generate wealth, which will
then be used to pay for clean-up; it fails to deem poor environmental rule
enforcement an 'unfair trade practice'; sanitary and phytosanitary standards
still leave legitimate consumer and environmental laws open to challenge as
trade barriers.

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission, last night warned
EC governments not to interfere with the delicate political balance of the
Community's institutions and not to blame the European monetary system for
recent financial turmoil.
Mr Delors said that, despite everything, the Community was still the world's
most successful example of co-operation between nations.
Mr Delors also risked upsetting Mr John Major, the British prime minister,
by suggesting that the inconsistency of his comments after the Maastricht
summit - claiming 'Game, set and match' for Britain but also backing closer
European co-operation - was one example of a 'deficit of behaviour' among
some politicians. '(We have to decide) if Europe is going to be a strong
union or a field of battle where (each member state) must win,' he said,
warning that 'nationalistic vanity' risked damaging the Community.
Mr Delors argued that the Commission already applied the principle of
subsidiarity - by which decisions are taken at the lowest level appropriate.
He conceded there was a need for more subsidiarity, democracy and
transparency but warned that any attempt to simplify the EC's complex
institutional framework would have to be done carefully.
Mr Delors was speaking in Brussels on the future of Europe as part of the
Grandes Conferences Catholiques, a series of talks given by world statesmen.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S cultural diplomacy is threatened by cuts in public spending and
the government's drive to open up the Civil Service to competition from the
private sector, Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of the British Council, warned
yesterday.
Sir Martin, former chairman of Barclays de Zoete Webb, said at the launch of
the council's annual report that the government's efforts to reduce public
expenditure plans threatened the grants made by the Foreign Office each year
to support the efforts of the council, the main agency for promoting British
culture and the English language overseas.
He also warned that it might have to withdraw from some countries altogether
if it lost the contracts for work on behalf of the Overseas Development
Administration.
The report showed the first real decline in turnover since the early 1980s.
Income from the council's commercial network of language-teaching centres
rose 17 per cent to Pounds 38m while income from agency work on behalf of
other bodies fell 8 per cent. As a result, it withdrew from the Cote
d'Ivoire and scaled down activities in the Nordic countries.
It managed to harness funding from different sources, including increasing
private-sector sponsorship from Pounds 3.8m to Pounds 5.5m.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTRACTOR FANS and smoke detectors installed in new buildings are to be
exempt from value added tax immediately, HM Customs &amp; Excise has ruled.
Relief for new domestic housing has in the past been restricted to exclude
items not normally installed by builders such as electrical appliances.
But Customs has reconsidered the ruling following new building regulations
on fire safety and ventilation in kitchens and bathrooms requiring the
installation of fans and detectors.
In separate concessions resulting from recent court cases, Customs has
changed its position on two other VAT items connected with property.
Builders and developers will be able to claim back tax on that proportion of
their property portfolio which is prepared for sale, but not on those for
which they levy rental income.
The ruling follows decisions by the High Court to uphold the decision of VAT
Tribunals in cases brought by two companies, Briararch and Curtis Henderson.
In a fourth judgement, Customs also said yesterday it would introduce
extra-statutory concessions so tenants fitting out a building would not be
liable for tax costs already levied on builders.
This follows a ruling by the Scottish Court of Session favouring an original
property builder.

Marubeni estimated that the CIS will export around 750,000 tonnes of primary
ingot to the West as well as significant tonnages of 'off-grade' metal.
Recent Chinese buying has amounted to 150,000/200,000 tonnes, although China
is not expected to be as consistent a purchaser from now on, it said.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Sterling crisis batters Irish
farmers
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH FARM leaders are appealing for IPounds 18m (Pounds 16.7m) in emergency
support from the government for beleaguered mushroom, lamb and pig meat
exporters, who are being battered by the sterling crisis.
They have also requested government backing for a IPounds 300m
DM-denominated loan, to help farmers who are now facing real interest rates
of around 13 per cent since Ireland's recent three percentage point interest
rate hike.
Since sterling left the ERM on September 16, it has fallen by 12 per cent
against the punt, trading yesterday at around 107.5 to the punt.
In making the appeal this week, Mr Tom Parlon, the Irish Farmers'
Association deputy president, said: 'Farmers are entitled to the full
benefits of the strong punt and the government's 'no devaluation' policy.'
The DM loan, he said, would reduce farmers' interest rates by some 5 to 6
percentage points.
Beef and dairy producers are still protected from currency fluctuations by
the EC subsidies known as monetary compensation amounts (MCAs), due to be
phased out by next January, but the lamb, pig meat and mushroom producers
enjoy no such protection.
Ireland exports 45 per cent of its pig meat to the UK, worth some IPounds
60m per year. Mushroom growers are currently exporting some IPounds 43m
worth of produce annually to the UK, which represents 80 per cent of total
output.
Irish lamb exports, worth some IPounds 150m per year and representing 90 per
cent of total lamb output, have been indirectly affected by British lambs
displacing Irish produce in the French market, where 90 per cent of Irish
lamb exports are destined.
Lamb prices at Irish processing plants this week touched their lowest level
in 13 years. According to Mr John Elmore, an IFA spokesman for Ireland's
52,000 sheep farmers, many sheep farmers are now facing bankruptcy.
The IFA is calling for a temporary introduction of MCAs in the mushroom
sector, while an editorial in the Irish Farmer's Journal has gone even
further, saying: 'The Irish government (should) immediately seek full MCAs
on all agricultural produce for non-ERM members. To have floating exchange
rates and supposedly fixed agricultural prices is a nonsense. Any further
talk of abolishing MCAs from January is not on.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brittan clears reform of Milk
Marketing Board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS TO reform the Milk Marketing Board for England and Wales by turning it
into a single voluntary co-operative were yesterday cleared under the EC's
competition rules of the risk of creating or strengthening a monopoly.
However, Sir Leon Brittan, EC competition commissioner, said in a letter to
Mr John Gummer, UK agriculture minister, that he would have preferred the
statutory board to be succeeded by 'a number of successor organisations
rather than a single voluntary co-operative'.
The MMB welcomed the acceptance of its plans. Mr Bob Steven, chairman, said:
'This announcement is a significant step forward in the process of
establishing a successful co-operative.'
The Agriculture Ministry said yesterday it expected to table legislation on
reforming the MMB early next month.
The MMB's plan to end its 60-year-old monopoly has come under vigorous
opposition from the dairy industry. Last month Mr Biran Smith, president of
the Dairy Trade Federation (DTF), said he could not understand how a
government that believed in a free market could support its plans.
However, the latest MMB plans bear little resemblance to its original
ambitions. Sir Leon 'noted with approval' that they were 'considerably less
restrictive of competition than were earlier proposals'. In particular Dairy
Crest - the MMB's wholly-owned subsidiary with a 25 per cent share of the
UK's manufactured dairy products - is to be hived off.
Sir Leon also made it clear that 'given the element of uncertainty' over the
full details of the plans, his department would be carefully monitoring the
initial period of trading by the new co-operative.
Mr Smith of the DTF pointed out yesterday that the EC had been 'sufficiently
alarmed as to insist on prior changes to the board's plans. The Commission
has vindicated recent warnings from the dairy trade, consumers and retailers
that an unregulated monoply was in the making.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Argentina ready to bite at EC
fishing deal - With a bait of Dollars 100m, it is hard to resist selling
licences
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVER the last ten years, Argentina's once non-existent fishing industry has
grown steadily to the point where the country now exports more fish than
beef. In a sense, that is hardly surprising given the aversion to fish in
this nation of meat-eaters.
Nonetheless, growth has come more from rising international prices than a
huge increase in catches. Last year, Argentina raised exports to a record
Dollars 406.5m (Pounds 228.30), 26 per cent more than in 1990. But in volume
terms, exports were up by just 7.6 per cent to 274,457 tonnes. Five years
earlier, in 1987, exports of 242,299 tonnes brought in just Dollars 270.2m
in export revenues.
Now, the possibility of an agreement with the European Community allowing EC
vessels to buy licences to fish in Argentine waters may transform the
industry. Argentine negotiators say the pact would bring EC grants and loans
worth about Dollars 100m. That would give the sector a vital new impetus in
exchange for allowing around 50 EC ships into Argentine waters that
currently remain closed to virtually all foreign fishing ships.
A licensing regime has a special appeal to the government of President
Carlos Menem. First of all, the perpetually insolvent state needs revenue.
Second, its conversion to free market orthodoxy makes all protectionism
ideologically suspect.
But the accord's many local opponents say it would fatally undermine
Argentina's industry by replacing local vessels with EC ships, deny
Argentine companies vital EC markets and make a growing shore-based
processing industry impossible.
The opening up of Argentina's seas coincides with the decline in 'nomad
fishing'. Ships from countries like Poland, Spain, Russia, Taiwan, South
Korea and Japan used to roam the seven seas, fishing in international
waters. But the extension of territorial waters to 200 miles by many
countries has gradually deprived the nomads of fishing grounds and led to a
sharp increase in idle tonnage.
The EC's response has been to offer 'exit grants' as one-off payments to
encourage idle ships - nearly all Spanish - to leave EC registries. It has
also negotiated fishing agreements with third countries that allow EC
vessels to fish in their waters under licence, in exchange for duty-free
access to EC markets for their exports. At present, Argentine exports are
subject to EC duties and market quotas.
But Argentina's industry fears that signing an agreement would create a
dangerous precedent, encouraging other 'nomad' nations to demand similar
rights. And as foreign catches are generally processed and frozen on board
factory ships and exported direct to foreign markets, the great worry is
that Argentina's shore-based processing industry would atrophy with the
increase in foreign vessels.
Mr Julio Torre, director of Redes, a fishing trade magazine, says: 'By not
selling licences, the government would encourage local industry. Licences
are in the purest colonial style. (With licences) you would not even have
the fantasy of having an industry.'
Industry lobbyists say that allowing the EC to fish under licence would be
especially dangerous because this could cost them their biggest single
market: Spain bought a quarter of Argentina's fish exports in 1991. However,
it is unlikely that Argentine negotiators will grant the Spaniards direct
access to quotas of the most sought-after species, like the Hubbsi hake.
However, turning down free cash gifts worth Dollars 100m would be hard to
justify, as Mr Mario Olaciregui, president of Harengus SA, Argentina's
leading fishing company, recognises. He says 'Argentina wants more capital,
more technology, more investment. The accord with the EC would bring that,
plus new ships and finance for research and lower EC duty for Argentina's
exports.'
However, he warns that these benefits must be weighed against the risk of
Spanish ships displacing Argentina's exports to the EC. Furthermore, he
claims that EC grants would simply transfer the problem of idle tonnage from
Spain to Argentina. He says the only beneficiaries would be Spanish banks,
whose unwise loans to finance shipbuilding would be repaid with EC
taxpayers' money.
Mr Olaciregui believes that his company's growth should be a paradigm for
the rest of the industry. Harengus, founded in 1979, now accounts for almost
one-fifth of Argentina's fish and seafood exports.
Mr Olaciregui says: 'We have made total investments of Dollars 400m-500m in
10 years through 11 different joint venture companies with foreign
investors. We provide licences, local know-how and administration. But 100
per cent of the financing comes from foreign companies. They also provide
technology and the market.'
Although there is a will on both sides to reach an agreement, talks have
dragged on for months because Argentina was unwilling to allow
foreign-flagged vessels into its waters. But officials have promised the
Europeans a compromise formula in time for the meeting in Buenos Aires next
month.
But there are other complicating factors. To begin with, Argentina's ability
to accurately measure fish stocks is widely questioned. Policing is also a
serious problem, with the coastguard and navy hopelessly overstretched.
Still, there is a lot of room for growth: last year's record catch was less
than a fifth of the 1992 quota of 1.5m tonnes.
Another problem is the dispute between Argentina and Britain over the
Falkland islands. The Falklands have established a successful fish licensing
regime in a 150-mile radius around the islands. The British fear increased
fishing in Argentine waters could threaten Falklands fish stocks. They also
want to make sure that an EC accord would not imply recognition of
Argentina's claim to the islands.
Irrespective of any deal with the Europeans, Argentina must become
internationally competitive. But costs, instead of coming down, are
increasing month by month. And like so many other nations rich in natural
resources, Argentina must try to maximise the value of raw materials. Mr
Torre says catching, filleting and freezing fish in Argentina adds only 30
per cent to value. The remaining 70 per cent margin is appropriated by
processing plants and distributors in the developed world.

fall to 12m tonnes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INDIA fears sugar production in the current season will be at least 10 per
cent below target at a little over 12m tonnes, compared with a record 13.5m
tonnes in the year to this September.
Because of a prolonged dry spell at planting time, India will not only
harvest a smaller cane crop, but in several states the crushing operation
will be delayed by four to six weeks. Sugar mills will also have stiff
competition for cane from indigenous manufacturers of sweeteners like gur
and khandsari.
The federal government is not worried by the shortfall since the current
season's opening stock of 4.7m tonnes can satisfy four and a half months'
domestic demand.
India's domestic consumption of sugar, which is growing at an annual rate of
6 per cent to 7 per cent, was 11.4m tonnes in 1991-92. According to Mr Om
Dhanuka, spokesman for the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the
shortfall in sugar production will not stand in the way of exports, which
were begun in 1990-91.
Mr G Patil, president of the National Federation of Co-operative Sugar
Factories (NFCSF), has asked the government to release one million tonnes of
sugar for export during 1992-93.
Both ISMA and NFCSF argue foreign buyers will regard India as a 'serious and
regular exporter of sugar' if it creates a buffer of at least one million
tonnes. The Food and Civil Supplies Ministry agrees, but the final decision
rests with the finance ministry.

barrels a day
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL production by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries
increased to 24.7m barrels a day in September, according to the
International Energy Agency.
Opec agreed at its ministerial monitoring committee meeting in Geneva last
month that its market share in the fourth quarter of 1992 should be 24.2m
b/d - the equivalent of freezing its claimed August production level -
although Kuwait would be allowed to increase production as it continued to
rebuild its oil industry after the Gulf war.
However, the IEA's report follows surveys by the Reuters news agency and the
magazine Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, which both put real Opec production
last month at at least 500,000 b/d higher than the agreed level.
The IEA forecast worldwide oil demand in the fourth quarter at 68.2m b/d -
compared with 68.1m b/d in the same quarter last year - suggesting demand
for Opec oil could be about 25.5m b/d. Analysts still expect this to produce
a tight market and higher oil prices.
Worldwide demand for the year 1992 is estimated at 67.0m b/d, 0.3m b/d more
than 1991.

COPPER prices performed strongly on the LME's afternoon kerb, ending firm
and pulling other depressed metals off their lows, dealers said. The upturn
in copper was technically motivated, following several sessions of plunging
prices. However dealers say the fundamental weakness of the base metal
sector, namely sluggish global economic prospects, will restrict the extent
of rallies. NICKEL closed steady, partly aided by Inco's moves to reduce
1993 production by some 18,000 tonnes. But for the market to sustain a rally
other producers need to follow suit, dealers said. New York's arabica COFFEE
futures were broadly higher at midday on technical factors and uncertainty
over future shipments from Brazil. 'The situation in Brazil is worsening.
Their internal market remains strong, and every indication points to exports
in September being lower than in August,' said a dealer. London robusta
coffee rallied in late trade and closed at the day's highs in most
positions. GOLD held steady on the London bullion market, with US funds
apparently holding their positions against the background of recent
volatility in currency and equity markets.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bright future seen for
aluminium contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR secondary (or recycled) aluminium is forecast to nearly double by
the year 2,000, which is why the London Metal Exchange expects a bright
future for its new secondary aluminium alloy contract, said Mr John Wolff,
the LME chairman, yesterday.
The new contract, for material used mainly by diecasters supplying the motor
industry, started quietly yesterday but this was widely expected. Mr Wolff
said: 'It will take time to bed down. But it is a very large market and
growing.'
He pointed out that about 4.5m tonnes of aluminium alloy was produced each
year and output was growing at an annual 6 per cent, driven by the
increasing use of the metal by car makers attracted by its light weight and
recyclability.
Cash trading of the contract - the LME's first new one since nickel was
launched in 1979 - will begin on January 4. Stocks have already started to
build up in LME warehouses and the exchange will give details of total
tonnages at the end of October. The LME had to invent a symbol for the
material (see insert above).
Mr Ralph Kestenbaum, chairman of the LME's aluminium alloy committee, said
that on the unofficial market in the past two months alloy had been traded
at a Dollars 10 a tonne premium to the LME's primary aluminium contract and
also at a Dollars 65 discount. This showed that the primary contract was not
a satisfactory proxy for alloy and the new contract was needed.
The alloy price, which was Dollars 1,160 a tonne on the unofficial market on
Monday, closed yesterday at Dollars 1,175.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Banking payments delays to be eliminated by 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RADICAL overhaul of the UK's banking payments system, aimed at reducing
the risk of a domino effect if a bank collapses, was announced yesterday by
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England.
Delays in the settlement of big payments between the clearing banks are
planned to be eliminated by 1995. At the moment, large value payments
between banks, which are carried out through Chaps, the Clearing House
Automated Payments System, take place only at the end of each business day.
The Bank of England believes this delay in settlement of interbank payments
is one of the most worrying flaws in the banking system.
Only substantial interbank payments - as opposed to the transfer of funds
linked to the clearance of cheques for personal customers - will be affected
by the reform. If a bank were to run into financial difficulties now and was
unable to make its end-of-day payments to other banks, those other banks
could also run into severe financial difficulties.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said: 'Intra-day exposures (between banks) can be massive
 -sometimes exceeding the capital of the banks concerned.'
Three years ago Mr Leigh-Pemberton encouraged the banks to work on a way of
reducing their exposure to each other. The best way was to introduce a 'real
time gross settlement system', said Mr Leigh-Pemberton at the payments
systems international conference in London.
Members of Chaps are this year introducing limits on the size of their
exposures through the payments system to individual banks. However, the Bank
of England believes this should only be a temporary solution because it
could have adverse effects on bank customers.
At the moment, any non-bank institution receiving a big payment through the
banking system can receive the funds as soon as the transfer order has been
placed. For example, if a customer of Midland pays Pounds 100m to a Barclays
customer, Barclays may credit the funds to its customer as soon as it
receives the order, even though it will not actually receive the funds from
Midland until the end of the day.
However, if Barclays were to breach its limit on the amount of intra-day
credit it can give to Midland, it might delay transferring the funds to its
customer.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Boeing was about to warn on older 747s before El Al crash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING was about to warn all airlines operating older versions of the 747
jumbo jet to inspect engine fixtures just before the El Al 747 cargo
aircraft crashed in Amsterdam on Sunday after losing two engines.
The US manufacturer yesterday said airline customers had been notified
before the Amsterdam disaster that an inspection request was pending. The
issue was also discussed at a meeting of 747 operators called by Boeing last
month.
But formal notification asking airlines to inspect the fuse pins connecting
the engine struts to the wings was only sent on Monday night, after the
Amsterdam crash, to the 69 operators of 747-100, 747-200 and 747-300 jets
powered with Pratt &amp; Whitney or Rolls-Royce engines. The El Al aircraft was
a 747-200 with Pratt &amp; Whitney engines.
Last night, rescue workers had recovered 15 bodies from the rubble of two
adjoining apartment blocks hit by the aircraft on Sunday. The official
estimate of the number of people killed is more than 250.
Civil aviation officials said it was too early to speculate on precise
causes of the crash. They said it was unclear whether the crash was caused
by an uncontained explosion in one engine which damaged the second or
whether a structural failure occurred in the engine mounting.
The aircraft's flight recorder has not been found. Last night, a Boeing
investigator said it could have been destroyed or 'rendered unusable' by the
intense heat generated by the crash.
Airlines yesterday began checking pins on more than 500 older 747 aircraft.
The pins are designed to enable an engine to break away from the wing in the
event of a failure.
Boeing, the world's biggest airliner manufacturer with about 60 per cent of
the world commercial airliner market, stressed that its formal request for
inspection was a 'precautionary measure'. It added that the causes of the El
Al crash and a similar accident of a China Airlines 747 cargo aircraft in
Taiwan last year were still unknown.
It added that there was 'no evidence' that the pins, which measure 4 inches
by 2 1/4 inches, were implicated in either the Amsterdam or the Taiwan
disasters.

FT  07 OCT 92 / VAT man finally lets shellfishers off the hook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVON fishermen angling to keep crab and lobster bait free of value added
tax have landed a resounding victory against HM Customs and Excise thanks to
the sophisticated palates of shellfish. After an intensive 15-month
campaign, Customs has agreed that fresh fish used to catch shellfish will
not be liable for VAT - as long as they are fit for human consumption.
Maggots, lugworms and other bait used by anglers will retain the 17.5 per
cent levy.
At the heart of the case is the fact that crabs and lobsters are highly
discriminating creatures which will not eat anything that humans will not
eat.
Mr Chris Venmore, honorary secretary of South Devon Shellfishermen, said:
'As a rule of thumb, if a human won't eat it, a crab won't eat it. The
fresher the fish, the better the catch.'
Mr Peter Watt, who sells fish to shellfishermen and was faced with a
possible backdated VAT claim of Pounds 78,000, said yesterday: 'I am very
relieved. This was one of those silly laws that should never have been
there.'
The problem came to light several years ago when a local VAT inspector
noticed an invoice including VAT from a fish merchant to a crab fisherman
and decided that all fresh fish for that use was bait - liable to tax.
The fishermen argued that their fish is not bait but food fit for human
consumption, which is zero-rated. They say that bait is bought in small
quantities by hobbyist anglers, while fish is bought in large quantities for
commercial shellfishing.
The fishermen could have claimed back the VAT, but this would have taken
three months.
This led to the launch of a campaign in July last year by the association,
which represents 200 fishermen and crew accounting for more than half of the
UK's crab and lobster harvest.
Three letters sent via Mr Anthony Steen MP, to the Treasury and the
paymaster general, who is responsible for Customs, were rebuffed.
Only after the association threatened to appeal to the VAT tribunal and was
given a meeting to put its case did Customs relent.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: New issues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Monday's 103-point fall in the FT-SE index was not the ideal backdrop to a
new equity issue. However, for Trinity Holdings' shares to be priced at a
discount of more than 20 per cent to last week's informally indicated level
is a measure of the market's caution. Some allowance must be made for
pre-placing hype. But the issue probably only got away because a firm order
book for this bus and fire truck maker and its high proportion of overseas
sales attracted institutional interest.
Market volatility is not the only problem facing those wishing to raise new
money. The heavy gilt funding programme has also caused indigestion. That
problem has recently abated, thanks in part to massive foreign exchange
intervention, but it will be back with a vengeance next year. Current
projections show that the gilt funding requirement in 1993-94 may be greater
than domestic institutions' total cash inflow. Thus there is a real prospect
of equity issues being crowded out by gilts. In an ideal world, companies
might prefer to wait for solid signs of recovery and lower interest rates so
that they can paint a prettier picture for the institutions. In a less than
ideal world, those with a good exports story to tell may be tempted to beat
the rush.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Trafalgar House
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Trafalgar's defence was always going to be hobbled by the close reporting
season and a shortage of time. Given these constraints, yesterday's document
is not a bad effort. Trafs has provided the most solid evidence to date that
it is not in serious financial trouble. Cash flow in the six months to
September seems to have been a lot better than the market was expecting, and
there are no covenant problems with its banks. Claims for the quality of the
businesses - and their international spread - are by now familiar. But the
formal acknowledgement of plans to realise value through disposals - and of
the need for fresh boardroom blood - can be read as positive signals.
Obviously Trafalgar's image remains dogged by accounting controversy and
unanswered questions relating to the size of future property write-downs.
This makes valuation especially hazardous. On the basis of most outside
estimates and the Keswicks' involvement in the first place, though, it is
not unreasonable for investors to assume that there is more than 85p a share
waiting to get out.
The only worry about staying for the ride is that if everyone takes the same
view Hongkong Land may end up without a large enough stake to make itself
heard. That argument, though, is flawed. Change is already underway at
Trafalgar - life in the Ritz canteen will never be the same again - and even
with just 15 per cent Land should be able to act as a focus for effective
shareholder pressure. The threat of ultimate takeover, moreover, will surely
concentrate minds.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Prudential
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Having swung the axe on estate agencies and the commercial broker business,
Prudential looked poised to tackle its problems in general reinsurance. The
approach unveiled yesterday avoids outright withdrawal, but Mercantile &amp;
General will see sharply lower premium income in the years ahead. By staying
in the market, the Pru hopes to safeguard valuable profits on its wholesale
life business, which shares a similar customer base.
Yet the Pru readily admits a sharper focus on profits at M&amp;G will lead to
reduced market share. With scant sign of a general hardening of rates across
the reinsurance market, the loss of share could be considerable. One effect
will be to leave M&amp;G more heavily geared to losses on the long tail of
general reinsurance business already written. The announcement of additional
underwriting losses in the second half, only a month after the interim
statement, underlines the point. There must be doubt about whether even a
slimmed-down M&amp;G can make sustainable profits in a volatile, commodity
business such as general reinsurance.
The alternatives were hardly appealing. A trade buyer was even less likely
to step forward after litigation surrounding the sale of Victory Re by Legal
&amp; General. Expansion ahead of an anticipated upturn in the reinsurance cycle
was too risky. The 4 per cent rise in Prudential's shares yesterday, in
spite of the nasty surprise on underwriting, suggests the market appreciates
the dilemma. Come the upturn, however, the Pru will have to decide whether
to be fully committed or to pull right out.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Marking the moment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is difficult to imagine after the upheavals in the ERM, but a few months
from now the D-Mark could be perceived as a weak currency. Yesterday's
figures for west German unemployment and industrial orders confirm the
impression of a softening, though not yet recession-bound, economy.
Unification will doubtless be seen as an even greater social and economic
burden if the downturn becomes pronounced. That is not a recipe for a strong
currency, especially given the discreet shift in the stance of the
Bundesbank.
It is becoming clearer by the day that the Bundesbank's determination to
hold money market rates below 9 per cent is more than just a short-term
response to ERM pressures. As if to emphasise this, it offered money market
liquidity yesterday at 8.9 per cent. Admittedly the arrangements carried
only a 14-day maturity, but we are past the point where money rates could
credibly rise again once ERM pressures subside. Markets might prefer an
explicit signal in the form of a lower Lombard rate, but the change is real
enough. Three-month Euromarks yield a quarter-point less than sterling even
after the cut in UK base rates.
Of course, the Bundesbank may not be in a hurry. It is still worried about
inflation and would certainly take fright if easier short-term money drove
long-term rates higher. That may ultimately matter less as the message sinks
in than the simple perception that the turning point has finally come.
Expectations of an easier German policy could produce a redirection of
investment flows towards the US once the presidential election is over. On
past experience, one would expect sterling to rise on the dollar's
coat-tails. That would secure for the UK chancellor some of the freedom he
hoped to gain by leaving the ERM.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Observer's patronising missive about Singapore ('Home truths', October
1) simply ignores the values offered by the country which for most families
have a higher priority than Cosmopolitan, chewing gum and the dubious merits
of western television.
Families who move to Singapore enter a life with a significantly enhanced
disposable income, greater responsibility for their affairs and their
actions, excellent and improving health and education facilities, clean,
safe streets and mainly polite, happy inhabitants. Singapore is a miracle of
the age and Lee Kuan Yew the mastermind of that miracle. What he has
produced is a far greater testament to family values than citizen's charters
and the American dream] Instead of carping criticism, we could do much worse
than adopt some of the policies which have enabled Singapore to succeed. My
family has two Singapore-born members and we have very happy memories of our
four years there.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Foreign Affairs: East of Maastricht - The Czecho-Slovak duet
is made even more discordant by efforts to stay in tune with the EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Vaclav Klaus, prime minister of the Czech Republic, makes no secret of
his admiration for Lady Thatch-er, the former UK prime minister. It is not
surprising to learn, therefore, that he is a Euro-sceptic, who regards the
treaty of Maastricht as 'a nightmare', and places more faith in bilateral
relations with individual west European countries than in the EC as such.
So, at least, it is confidently asserted in diplomatic and political circles
in Prague. But Mr Klaus has yet to go public with this view, even if he gave
a broad hint when, asked for his reaction to the French referendum result,
he said that a very narrow Yes was practically equivalent to a No.
Why should Mr Klaus be coy about his views on European Union? First, because
Czechs in general, and his own Civic Democratic party in particular, are
determined to 'return to Europe' after the long years of communism which
kept them away from what they regard as their natural home in the west.
Second, because Mr Klaus himself has espoused a special relationship with
Germany as the means to achieve this.
Both considerations make it impolitic to denounce Maastricht, unless and
until the west Europeans, especially the Germans, should decide to abandon
the project. Czechs do not wish to be thought of as half-hearted or lukewarm
Europeans. Therefore, so long as Maastricht is the official EC blueprint for
what Europe will look like at the end of the century, they feel the need to
proclaim that it also defines their long-term objectives, and that they will
be more than happy to accept its constraints.
When it comes to relations with the Slovaks, however, the Czechs find this
argument cuts both ways. On the one hand, they fear that being yoked to the
Slovaks may dilute their 'west European' credentials and hold them back in
their rush to embrace the capitalist way of life. On the other hand, it is
hard to explain why they are opposed to a union or confederation with
Slovakia when they claim to be in favour of a pan-European union as defined
by Maastricht.
Thus Mr Milos Zeman, the Czech Social Democrat leading the opposition to the
break-up of Czechoslovakia, made a shrewd move last week when he proposed to
transform the present federation into a Czecho-Slovak Union on the
Maastricht model, which would come to an end on the day that the Czech and
Slovak republics join the European Union itself. To Mr Klaus's fury, the
Czechoslovak Federal Assembly passed a resolution to draw up plans for such
a union, after his own proposal on the procedure for dissolving the
federation, agreed with his Slovak counterpart, Mr Vladimir Meciar, had
fallen just short of the required three-fifths majority.
The Klaus-Meciar proposal was defeated by an alliance between the Czech left
and the various opposition parties in Slovakia: Christian Democrats,
ex-communists and representatives of the Hungarian minority. But most of Mr
Meciar's supporters then switched sides and voted for Mr Zeman's 'union',
which sounds very like the 'confederation' formerly proposed by Mr Meciar.
Mr Klaus has consistently rejected the idea of a confederation, arguing that
no halfway house is possible between the present federation and two fully
independent states. He does accept that the two should form a customs union,
but rejects any notion of joint institutions or shared sovereignty, whether
in the field of defence and foreign policy or of economic, social and
environmental affairs. Even the single currency he would maintain only for a
short transitional period.
Mr Klaus's overriding fear is, evidently, that the success of his bold,
free-market policies in the Czech Republic would be endangered by the need
to subsidise a more protectionist and interventionist Slovak government. The
radical economic strategy he adopted as federal finance minister in 1990-92,
coinciding with the loss of cheap energy supplies and captive markets in the
former Soviet bloc, has had traumatic effects throughout the country.
Czechoslovak industrial output fell by 23 per cent in 1991, and a similar
figure is projected for 1992. Investment, hampered by tight credit
restrictions and high interest rates, was cut in half in 1991, while
consumer prices rose more than 50 per cent.
Admittedly this was a low rate of inflation by Russian or even Polish
standards, and this year it has fallen to less than 1 per cent per month.
But while many individual Czechs have taken to capitalism with gusto and are
visibly affluent, the incomes of the majority have not caught up with
prices.
Thus even in the Czech Republic Mr Klaus's policy is fraught with social
risk and political difficulty. He needs both time and a favourable
international climate for it to show dividends.
But Slovakia - which had a high concentration of uneconomic heavy industries
geared to the Soviet market, and lacks the advantage of proximity to Germany
 -is far worse placed to cope with the effects of such policies.
Unemployment, especially, has risen much more sharply in Slovakia, and this
has led many Slovaks to see Mr Klaus's policy as an anti-Slovak conspiracy
against which they need protection.
Mr Meciar seemed to offer that. He promised to secure greater autonomy and
to pursue an economic policy more suited to Slovak conditions. He also
offered emotional compensations to a people with an acute inferiority
complex: for 70 years the Slovaks have been alternately taken for granted or
talked down to by the Czechs, while the rest of the world has ignored them,
using 'Czech' as an abbreviation for 'Czechoslovak'.
The Slovaks may fairly be accused of wanting the best of both worlds: the
trappings of national sovereignty, combined with the security of federation.
They seem likely to end up with an independence more complete, and far more
uncomfortable, than they desired.
Unhappily it may have been President Vaclav Havel who gave Czechoslovakia
the coup de grace, with the televised address in which he solemnly warned
the Slovaks against voting for people with dictatorial tendencies - meaning,
quite clearly, Mr Meciar. This had the opposite of the effect intended,
drastically reducing his own popularity in Slovakia and boosting Mr
Meciar's. Not surprisingly, Mr Meciar and his supporters responded, after
the election, by blocking Mr Havel's re-election as federal president.
Mr Havel, for his part, has not concealed his disillusionment with the
Slovaks: he even lamented publicly that 70 years of Czech efforts to
civilise them and 'bring them to the west' had been in vain - thus perfectly
illustrating the Czech attitude that Slovaks object to.
He is now pinning his hopes on being the first president of the Czech
Republic, for which he will need Mr Klaus's support. He no longer insists
that a referendum be held before the federation is dissolved; and at a press
conference last Saturday he poured scorn on the proposal for a 'union'.
There was no case in history, he said, of a federation being replaced by a
union; and added - in a curious but revealing non sequitur - that
'Maastricht is really a federation'.
Mr Havel is undoubtedly a more genuine enthusiast for European Union than Mr
Klaus. Indeed, he proclaimed his belief that the process of European
integration would, in time, bring the Czechs and the Slovaks together again.
Yet, in order to toe the line that no halfway house is possible in the
Czecho-Slovak context, he feels obliged to assert that none exists, even in
the European context.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Letter: Clinton in position to balance US budget and lift
recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   Mr WILLIAM C DANVERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Time to assess Mr Clinton' (September 25), correctly
points out that Governor Clinton, like Harry Truman and John Kennedy before
him, should not be considered to be at a disadvantage with respect to
foreign affairs. He is quick to study and has surrounded himself with a
number of key foreign policy advisers from various points on the political
spectrum.
More importantly, he has shown a keen understanding of the need to inject
some economic realism into foreign policy. This may be the reason you
expressed doubt over his approach to trade, referring to 'disturbing
protectionist undertones'. In the cold-war era, trade and economic policy
took a back seat to American foreign and security policy considerations.
This is changing, and Governor Clinton is right to respond accordingly. But
this should not be mistaken for creeping protectionism.
You also point out that those who wish to see the US budget deficit reduced
have reason to fear a Clinton presidency. The opposite is more likely to be
true. In much the same way that it took a Republican like Richard Nixon to
go to China, it will probably take a moderate Democrat like Bill Clinton to
begin in earnest the process of balancing the budget.
Presumably he will have a Democratic Congress to work with and the full
support of the American people. If he can take advantage of both of these
opportunities in a timely fashion, there is hope that the US could finally
tame its runaway budget deficit.
At the same time, he will likely shift spending priorities toward helping US
industry and creating economic growth. Bill Clinton will not be afraid to
have the government work with the American business community to make it
more competitive. This is not a question of picking winners or losers. It is
a question of the US government forming a working relationship with business

FT  07 OCT 92 / Letter: Discriminating against UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs MARY DALMAHOY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am Mrs Absolutely Average working mother with two children and a
business to support and I spend discriminatingly as follows:
Shoes: Italian or French.
Washing machine: Swedish.
Dishwasher: German.
Car: German.
Clothes: 80 per cent Italian or French, usually from Japanese- owned
department stores.
Television: Japanese.
Fax: Japanese.
Furnishings: German or French.
Computer: American.
I buy design and quality. The price of many of the above could increase 50
per cent or more before I would seriously consider the inferior domestic
alternatives.
The anecdotes multiply. 'People still have money to spend,' it is said, 'but
there's nothing new to spend it on.' Is the trouble with British
manufacturing not the level of interest rates, nor anything else, but simply
the lack of well-designed high quality product?

FT  07 OCT 92 / Letter: Variations in the prices of Japanese cars can be
'huge'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN BRIDGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It should come as no surprise that there is a substantial price
differential for the Primera between the Japanese and UK markets ('Go to
Tokyo, save Pounds 2,840 on a UK-built Nissan', October 5).
The prices of Japanese cars show huge variations between the low-price
markets of Japan and the US on the one hand, and the high-price markets of
the EC on the other. European manufacturers, too, are obliged to sell at
competitive prices in Japan and the US.
A survey of Japanese models in the Primera size class, from two rivals of
Nissan, conducted by CAIR in February 1992, revealed the following index of
pre-tax advertised prices for four markets: Japan 100; US 103; France 141;
UK 153.
Depreciation of the pound and the dollar have changed the picture somewhat
to give a revised index as at October 2: Japan 100; US 99; France 148; UK
147.
The US now appears as the cheapest country in which to buy a Japanese make
in this size class, while post-ERM Britain is now marginally less expensive
than France. Discounts do help to redress the balance to a limited extent
when comparing the UK with Japan, but not with the US. Once taxes are added,
consumers in Britain can expect to pay 50 per cent more than Japanese
purchasers of similar vehicles, in most instances.
The differential for the Nissan Primera eGT, reported in the FT, is very
modest by this standard. In the leading car markets of the world, it is the
American consumer, benefiting from bigger discounts than his Japanese
counterpart, who probably enjoys the best bargain of all.
If Primeras from Sunderland were sold in the US, I am confident that this
pattern would be repeated.

Know your Financial Times, part 105. Back in February, Observer commented on
a window-dressing technique perfected by Harvey Nichols, the Knightsbridge
department store, which had commissioned some eye-catching sculptures made
out of 100,000 old copies of the Pink'un. Jolly good they were too.
Now a budding French artist, Josette Dacosta Bray, writes to say that she
finds old copies of the FT glued together to be the ideal base for her
acrylic paintings. She needs a base that is 'simultaneously rigid and
dynamic' and after experimenting with various journals she picked the FT
because of its 'broadsheet format and warm salmon-pink colour'.
In return for this endorsement Observer feels duty bound to give a plug to
Bray's exhibition at the French Cultural Centre in Oxford from October 23,
especially since her husband, Nicholas, works for the FT's rival, The Wall
Street Journal Europe.

<TEXT>
Manchester United, the quoted football club, has come up with a novel way of
publicising its most valuable collection of intangible assets - its players
 -without putting such delicate items on its balance sheet.
It has hired accountants Touche Ross to give an independent valuation of its
22-strong first team, plus 15 young professionals. They reckon the squad's
worth Pounds 24m. Looked at another way, investors own 197p of player for
every share held. This is in addition to the conventional net asset backing
of 344p and means that the shares, at 289p, should remain well outside the
penalty box.
Touche's credentials lie in its aptly named Touche Ross Football Industry
Team, captained by Gerry Boon. He says it's illogical for clubs to spend a
lot of money on players - United's first-team squad cost Pounds 17m to put
together, leaving aside the home-grown talent - and not to recognise their
value.

When it comes to working the old boy networks, retired central bankers are

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mystery solved. It was Willy Claes, the Belgian foreign minister, who
rubbished John Major's latest wheeze to bring the European Community closer
to the European citizen.
British officials had been coy about the reaction to Major's idea that EC
leaders should be given five minutes at the Birmingham summit on October 16
to explain in public their views on the future of the EC. One member had
been 'unenthusiastic', said the man from the FO.
Claes, it can be revealed, told his fellow EC foreign ministers in
Luxembourg he was unconvinced that a barrage of speechlets by heads of
government could solve the EC's image problem.
Several others shared Claes' view. 'Desperation' was the verdict of one
foreign observer. Another EC diplomat dismissed the idea as 'just a gimmick
for domestic political consumption in Britain'.
And there's the rub. It may be that European leaders are so concerned about
the state of public opinion in Britain about the Maastricht treaty that they
might just approve the idea. Says the man from the FO: 'It's certainly put
the cat among the pigeons.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / Personal View: The consumer is sold short - again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL JOFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Over the next few months hundreds of thousands of savers will learn whether
they will continue to be sold life assurance policies they do not need.
The UK's Office of Fair Trading is studying a report by the Securities and
Investments Board (Sib), the industry regulator, and Lautro, the insurance
sector watchdog, which lays down new rules on the sale of savings products.
These rules are the result of a two-year review of sales practices - the
so-called retail regulation review.
The review provided a golden opportunity to improve the way savings schemes
are sold to an increasingly savings-conscious nation. Yet these
self-regulatory watchdogs have proposed little more than recommendations
which largely justify existing rules.
So has the consumer benefited from the self-regulation of the past few
years? The evidence suggests not.
Consider the following:
Figures from Sib show that between 25-33 per cent of insurance policies will
be surrendered within the first two years of their life. The investors
concerned will lose part or all of their money;
The continued growth in sales of endowment policies - a form of savings
scheme which lost its competitive edge when income tax relief on premiums
was abolished in 1984. Endowment policies do not match the returns from
personal equity plans. Yet in 1991 nearly four in every five mortgages was
backed by an endowment policy.
These are not the signs of a competitive market offering consumers choice
and value. Since the Financial Services Act of 1986, which introduced
regulation into the industry, the situation has deteriorated.
Commissions and expenses - ultimately paid for by the consumer - have risen.
Before 1988, an appointed representative earned Pounds 396 in commission for
selling a 25-year endowment policy with a monthly premium of Pounds 50. Now,
the average commission is Pounds 570.
And competition, too, has declined. Most of the real competition takes place
through the better independent financial advisers (IFAs). But regulation has
forced many IFAs to become tied agents, selling only one company's products.
Tied agents need not declare the commission they receive for selling a
savings scheme; with an IFA, the consumer has a right to this information.
The IFA has become an endangered species, particularly at the lower end of
the market where consumers are most vulnerable. The number of independent
advisers has dropped sharply and all but one of Britain's 10 largest
building societies are now tied to one company's products.
The regulatory system has failed for two main reasons. First, it is based on
an unrealistic model of competition. Second, existing rules are weak and
their enforcement timid.
The competition model assumes that if consumers are given enough information
at the point of sale, they will select the right product. This ignores the
complexity of many savings and pension products and the difficulty of
comparing one with another. Consumers, even the financially literate, will
usually rely on the sales-person.
The model also misconceives the sales process. For example, anyone thinking
of buying a savings product is supposed to receive a 'buyer's guide' which
states whether the sales-person is a tied agent or an IFA. Often, the
sales-person does not hand over the guide. More important, most consumers do
not read the material in the presence of the sales-person; they rely on what
they are told. Furthermore, the majority of people have little appreciation
of the significance of the IFA/tied agent distinction.
Enforcement is so timid that many life companies just pay lip service to the
rules. It is little surprise that many consumers still fall victim to the
life assurance industry's aggressive selling techniques.
The Sib/Lautro proposals will, at best, make only a modest difference. For
instance, the proposals stop short of insisting that the amount taken out of
a scheme's returns by charges and commissions is expressed as a simple cash
sum - the figure which the regulator's own research suggests people find
easiest to grasp. And there is no suggestion to remedy the imbalance between
IFAs and tied agents in terms of their disclosure on commissions, which so
threatens the future of the independents.
The regulators' staff are committed to consumer protection, but, too often,
their proposals are so diluted by industry pressure as to be ineffectual.
Self-regulation raises conflicts of interest: the principal loyalty of the
industry representatives on the boards of the self-regulatory organisations
will inevitably be to their companies, not consumers. The contrast with the
regulation of the privatised industries is stark. If the directors of
British Telecom had dominated Oftel, the industry watchdog, we would surely
not have had the recently-announced price cuts.
There is much that a bold regulator could do to protect the consumer and
promote real competition. The SIB/Lautro proposals will not achieve this.
They are the grudging concessions of an industry trying to preserve the
status quo.
We will not see real competition or better value for the consumer until the
regulators are controlled by members representing the public.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The British Council has appointed John Hanson as director-general, it was
announced at yesterday's annual general meeting.
Hanson, 53, was previously deputy director-general and had been acting
director-general since the death of Sir Richard Francis in June.
A graduate of Wadham College, Oxford, Hanson is a career civil servant who
has spent most of his working life with the Council. Having become a fluent
Arabic speaker during his second posting abroad in the Lebanon, he went on
to be the Council's director in Bahrain and a cultural counsellor in Iran in
the period leading up to the downfall of the Shah. His first and final
postings abroad were to India.
During his four years as deputy director-general, Hanson was responsible for
developing and leading the Council's strategy for repositioning itself. This
led to a radical re-appraisal of planning, management, personnel and
financial systems.
The decision to appoint Hanson as director-general won the unanimous backing
of the Board of the Council and the warm endorsement of the Foreign
Secretary, according to Sir Martin Jacomb, chairman of the Council. The
post, advertised nationally, attracted 257 applications; 34 were interviewed
and Hanson selected from a shortlist of three.

Haagen-Dazs, one of the UK's most successful ice cream brands despite having
been launched just over one year ago, has lost its UK managing director,
Justin King.
Owned by Grand Metropolitan, Haagen-Dazs has prided itself on a successful
high profile ad campaign which has gained much attention for its use of
sexual teasing. So could King's demise thus be related to the ad campaign?
Not at all, says Tony McGrath, managing director of Haagen-Dazs north
Europe. 'We parted company by mutual agreement, following a disagreement
over the future direction for the company.'

Tony Belisario is to become managing director of an enlarged Dowty
Electronic Systems and Components, part of TI Group since it was bought in
June. Belisario was with Dowty Defence and Air Systems and Dowty Fuel
Systems before leaving to join GEC Aerospace. Geoff Bicknell has been
appointed finance director, joining the division from Lucas.
As part of the same management reorganisation, Colin Cocks is to move from
managing director of Electronic Systems to vice chairman of Dowty, with
responsibility for government relations.

David Vincent, 49, md of Raine's Hall &amp; Tawse division, takes over as group
md. He has spent 32 years in the construction industry, primarily with

FT  07 OCT 92 / Signal failures of rail reform: Government plans to
privatise BR cannot meet competition, service and efficiency targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
However upbeat a note Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, may try to
strike at today's Conservative party conference, the reality behind the
privatisation of British Rail is that it is in danger of running into the
buffers.
The government remains as determined as ever to drive through the
legislation that will make rail privatisation possible: it hopes to
introduce a bill in November and to complete the parliamentary process by
next summer.
But as Department of Transport officials struggle to flesh out the bones of
the white paper published in July, they are having to face up to the gloomy
prognosis that the main aims of privatisation - more competition, greater
efficiency and a wider choice of services - seem likely to translate into
almost the opposite: local monopolies, even greater government subsidies,
and the closure of both passenger and freight services.
The principal factor undermining the government's plans is the one that has
made rail privatisation so difficult from the start: the fact that BR is
heavily loss-making. Even after subsidies of more than Pounds 1bn for
commuter and branch line services in the year to March 1992, it turned in a
pre-tax loss of Pounds 145m.
A wholesale sell-off in the manner of other privatisations is therefore seen
as impracticable. Instead, the government has decided to leave the railway
tracks with BR and pursue a less ambitious notion of getting the operation
of the trains into private hands. Its three-pronged plan is to sell BR's
freight train operations outright; to franchise out the operation of the
passenger services; and to encourage the private sector to start up new
passenger or freight train services in competition with existing ones.
Private sector involvement apart, the biggest innovation is the separation
of the ownership of the trains from ownership of the tracks. After
privatisation, the BR residuary body looking after the tracks - to be called
Railtrack - will be required to operate on a commercial basis, earning a
return on its assets by charging train operators for the use of its lines.
The terms on which operators get access to the tracks are crucial to the
success or failure of privatisation because they will largely determine
whether there is any money to be made from running trains. But it is
increasingly clear that any terms acceptable to train operators are likely
to be in conflict with privatisation's main objectives.
Take freight. At present, BR will carry almost any traffic provided it helps
offset fixed costs. Customers are charged according to their ability to pay,
with the result that some traffic makes only a small contribution to fixed
costs while other traffic makes a comparatively large contribution.
All this will change with privatisation. When the time comes for Railtrack
to set out the track charges for private sector freight train operators, it
may decide that the fair way to do so is to divide the track costs evenly
between them. But this will mean that the traffic previously making small
contributions to fixed costs will suddenly face much higher charges and
become unviable, while the traffic that was previously making big
contributions will enjoy a sudden fall in charges. One effect will be a loss
of the marginal freight traffic to the roads; another, a downturn in
Railtrack's revenues which will have to be made up by higher charges to
other track users.
One answer to this conundrum is to let Railtrack stick to the old system and
charge what the market will bear. But it cannot, because under an EC
transport directive governing access to the railways from January next year,
the new track-charging regime is required to be non-discriminatory. Any
attempt to introduce differential pricing would therefore provoke complaints
to Brussels under EC competition law.
The problems on the passenger side are still more fraught. Many of them are
attributable to the government's determination to introduce competition to
the railways by offering open access to all.
Take, for example the hypothetical case of a company called TrainCo bidding
for the franchise to operate the InterCity line between London King's Cross
and Edinburgh. Once it has established what it must pay Railtrack for the
use of the tracks and BR for the rental of its trains, TrainCo should be
ready to launch its bid.
But wait: what about open access? The government has said it wants to
encourage competition by allowing other train operators to start up services
alongside existing ones. Entrepreneurs, however, would only be interested in
attacking the most lucrative services: in TrainCo's case, for example, they
would probably want to operate a service 10 minutes ahead of the Flying
Scotsman. So franchisees like TrainCo would have their profits attacked on
the most lucrative services while still being obliged to run the other less
profitable or loss-making trains.
The same problem applies equally to subsidised services such as Network
SouthEast's commuter operations. The government has said there will be
negative tendering for loss-making services: in other words, franchises will
go to the companies requiring the smallest subsidies. But not every train
within an unprofitable service loses money, so entrepreneurs might still be
tempted to enter the market and pick off profitable niches. The franchisee
would then face even bigger losses on the remaining services.
Two conclusions follow from the problems posed by open access. If the
government holds fast to its commitment to open access, either the private
sector will decline to bid for franchises altogether, or it will bid very
small sums for the profitable franchises and require very large subsidies
for the unprofitable ones. The result will be a big increase in the burden
on the Exchequer. The only obvious alternative is to abandon open access and
make the franchises exclusive: but that would defeat the government's
intention to provide for on-rail competition.
There is worse, from the passengers' point of view: at least, that is, for
passengers living on the branch lines of Scotland, Wales and south-west
England. Once Railtrack is in operation, the heavy cost of keeping these
branch lines open will become transparent because Railtrack will be charging
the whole of the cost to their users. The result would be to put the future
of the lines in doubt.
Take, for example, the line from Inverness to Wick in the far north of
Scotland. The costs of operating and maintaining this 161-mile line - not
presently divulged by BR - must be colossal; yet it carries only three
trains daily each way, each of just two carriages. Any franchisee taking on
the service would have to meet the whole of the track costs from the
revenues from these three small trains.
The train operator's losses would not only be vast, but would also be
exposed to public scrutiny through the size of the subsidy required by the
franchisee to take on the service. Once this happened, and it became clear
that considerable sums could be saved by shutting the line and providing all
its passengers with chauffeur-driven limousines instead, closure could
become impossible to resist.
Where subsidies are concerned, the prospect of line closures might suggest
that the Treasury would gain from rail privatisation. In fact, it will
almost certainly not: indeed, Whitehall sources indicate that the Treasury
has already resigned itself to providing higher subsidies as a result of
rail privatisation.
One reason already touched upon is that the levelling of freight charges
will cause marginally profitable traffic to disappear, while traffic that
made a big contribution will enjoy a reduction in charges. Another is if
open competition on the passenger lines leaves private sector entrepreneurs
to cherry-pick the most lucrative services and keep the profits for
themselves, the taxpayer will be left with an even bigger bill for
subsidising the remaining services.
In theory, these influences should be offset by efficiency gains from the
private sector's involvement. But in practice, with Railtrack remaining a
public sector monopoly and most of the passenger services remaining
subsidised, there appears to be little scope for market forces to be brought
to bear. Besides, the new structure will also have to carry the costs of the
bureaucracies being created to serve it: Railtrack, the director general of
Railway Regulation, the Passenger Railway Franchising Authority, and the
operator licensing functions of the Health and Safety Executive, to name but
four.
Not all of privatisation's problems are insuperable. With freight charges,
for example, some of the worst aspects of non-discriminatory pricing might
be partially alleviated by establishing a range of price bands for different
kinds of traffic. The aim would be to persuade the competition authorities
that each kind of traffic constituted a separate market and therefore
warranted a differential pricing regime.
Some kind of fudge may also salvage the vestiges of open access. Any idea of
different companies' trains competing simultaneously for the same passengers
is out of the question, but it is just possible that some new services could
be allowed onto the tracks provided they did not undermine the viability of
existing ones by replicating them too closely.
Even so, the reality of privatisation is in danger of falling far short of
expectations. Insofar as privatisation brings any changes at all, they may
be slow to arrive and almost imperceptible in their effects. Indeed, from
this distance it is looking increasingly probable that the disadvantages
will outweigh the benefits.
So has the government chosen the wrong structure for privatisation? Probably
not. Given the scale of BR's losses and the difficulties of trying to
reconcile its commercial objectives with its social obligations, any 'Big
Bang' sell-off of the railway, in whole or in parts, would probably have
raised even more problems.
Many of the difficulties outlined above, however, would evaporate if the
railways could be made profitable. One reason why they are not so is that
they cannot compete with roads which are free at the point of use.
Significantly, transport ministers have been talking with more than usual
enthusiasm in the last few days about the possible advantages of road
pricing - that is, introducing a charge to vehicles for use of the busier
roads. What Mr MacGregor says about that today may ultimately be more
significant for the future of the railways than anything he says about
privatisation itself.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Well done, Chaps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A financial system that seems daily to get more fragile, any step to
reduce risk is welcome. For the layman, however, it is not always an
unalloyed pleasure, since it is often accompanied by a realisation for the
first time of just how big the risks have been.
The decision by the UK banking industry to move towards a real-time system
for settling large transactions is such a step, and creates just such a
sense of mingled enthusiasm and dismay. The enthusiasm stems from the
thought that the new system, when it comes into effect, will greatly improve
the robustness of the UK's financial plumbing. The dismay stems from an
appreciation of the scale of the risks the system has been running.
Chaps, the system that handles large UK payments - typically Pounds 2m or so
at a time - works well at a technical level. The risk it runs, however, is
well summed up by Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank of
England, in a speech yesterday.
'The vast volumes of business being processed through the payment system'
have led, he said, 'to huge unmeasured intra-day exposures for banks, as a
result of their willingness to give customers immediate use of incoming
funds before being certain that inter-bank transfers would be settled.' Such
intra-day exposures can sometimes exceed the capital of the banks concerned.
They arise because big customers can withdraw incoming money within the day;
banks are only certain that they will get the money when the settlement
process has been completed at the end of the day. That settlement process
takes place by netting off payments owed by one bank against those owed it
by another. The net amounts are settled by drawing on the banks' accounts at
the Bank of England.
Risk removed
Since the Bank cannot, as the lender of last resort, allow the settlement
process to threaten the survival of a bank, it has become the implicit
guarantor, at potential public cost, of private-sector transactions.
Hence the Bank's evident desire to nudge the banking industry towards a
system which avoids the risk of a failed end-of-day settlement. It does so
in a number of ways. By settling in real time - that is, instantly - it
removes the risk implicit in delayed settlement. By settling gross  - that
is, by transferring the whole of each individual payment, not merely the net
total of the day's transactions - it removes the unpredictable risks
associated with netting.
City's image
In particular, it will remove the risk that the netting process might prove
unsustainable under English law, in the event of a bank failure. London's
image as a legally robust financial centre, already damaged by the
local-authority swaps case, could scarcely survive another legal disaster.
Finally, by routing these real-time gross transactions via the Bank of
England, it creates an explicit central bank guarantee of payment. Mirrored
by similar developments elsewhere in the EC, and by the recommendations of
an EC committee chaired by Mr Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, this creates an
opportunity to resolve the difficult issues that will arise in the creation
of an integrated European payments system. This will be essential under
European monetary union, and is probably inevitable in any case as a result
of irreversible trends towards cross-border economic integration. Explicit
central-bank guarantees of individual national payments systems allow them
to be linked much less riskily than would otherwise be the case.
Still, for banks and their customers there will be a cost involved in all
this virtue. Today's implicit Bank guarantee will be replaced by explicit
Bank intra-day overdrafts - without an interest cost, but requiring banks to
offer the Bank collateral.
It is perhaps not surprising that the tone with which the Bank greets this
new dawn is slightly more enthusiastic than that used by the clearing banks.
It would be a pity, however, if banks turned the proposed date for the
introduction of the new system - 1995 - into a vague aspiration rather than
a firm commitment. Appreciating the scale of the risks makes reducing them
appear all the more pressing.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Europe's Italian job
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EUROPEAN leaders prepare for their emergency summit meeting in Birmingham
next week, they risk paying insufficient attention to the crisis in one of
the EC's most important members.
Italy is not the only EC state suffering a haemorrhage of market confidence,
a plummeting currency and intense difficulties over public spending. But its
problems, in these and many other respects, make those elsewhere in the
Community look manageable. Unless the Birmingham meeting gives a convincing
show of support for Mr Giuliano Amato, the country's weak but courageous
prime minister, those problems could lead to such instability as to blow
open the EC's southern flank.
In the three weeks since the lira and the pound were swept out of the
exchange rate mechanism, other EC governments have been tempted to leave
Italy to cope with its crisis alone. In some quarters there has been
Schadenfreude at the self-inflicted wounds of a country which has for years
been bankrupt in all but name; in others, relief at seeing an end to the
make-believe of a state with a budget deficit nearly triple the EC average
aspiring to join a monetary union within seven years.
These reflexes are understandable but wrong. Italy is a signatory of the
Maastricht treaty and one, unlike Britain, clearly intent upon rejoining the
ERM as soon as possible. This will not prove easy, but Italy has the right
to expect that its partners will do everything they can to make it possible.
Bold first step
At the same time, Mr Amato and the Italian parliament have an urgent
domestic agenda before them. First, parliament must approve the 1993 budget
presented last week - by Italian standards a bold first step, yet only the
minimum required if the state is to retain control over its finances.
The problem is that parliament is suffering from legislative indigestion and
shows little sign of being ready to approve the measure before the end of
November. With the lira under attack and a minor bank run last week, that is
too casual a timetable.
The currency's effective 20 per cent devaluation against the D-Mark is in
turn fuelling inflationary pressures and stirring unrest among the trade
unions. Next Tuesday there is to be a four-hour general strike in protest at
austerity measures, and union pressure is mounting for Mr Amato to reverse
one of his best achievements: the agreement to end Italy's system of
automatic wage indexation, the scala mobile.
A fresh explosion in wage demands would leave the government's budgetary
strategy in ruins, destroy its hopes of EMS re-entry for the foreseeable
future and bring closer the twin spectres of hyperinflation or default.
Parliament and the unions need to realise that Italy faces a national
emergency in which heavy sacrifices are required.
Unrelieved turbulence
Equally, the government cannot allow itself to become paralysed while
waiting for approval of the budget. It needs to get on with sorting out the
tangled affairs of state-owned enterprises in readiness for privatisation, a
process which is still generating more confusion than confidence.
With markets in a state of unrelieved turbulence, Mr Amato needs above all
to explain his policies clearly, to steer them through parliament with the
maximum dispatch and to make it clear to Italy's European friends what they
can do to help.
He has already asked the EC for a substantial standby loan to boost the lira
and sustain confidence in plans for its return to the ERM. But he has failed
to provide a proper explanation of what he wants the money for, and the
suspicion persists that any loan would be used simply to repay the
Bundesbank for funds it advanced during the ill-fated effort to prop up the
currency last month.
Other Community governments are unlikely to accede to this request without a
fuller idea of, and greater confidence in, Mr Amato's overall strategy. But
neither the Italians themselves nor their partners should underestimate what
is at stake. Italy is a founder member of the Community. It has always
measured itself by European standards and, unlike Britain, has never
contemplated any alternative identity. If it is now found wanting, the
psychological effect will be profound. Even the unity of the state could no
longer be taken for granted.

FT  07 OCT 92 / An open commitment: A call for more transparency in British
monetary management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GORDON PEPPER and ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The crisis of confidence which has undermined sterling in the past few days
is mainly due to uncertainty about government policy. Yet in countries where
monetary policy is not under political control, political difficulties do
not normally turn into financial crises. This has led to proposals that the
Bank of England should be made independent.
We doubt whether this would, of itself, solve the British problem, which is
not due only to political interference. The monetary regime has changed
frequently and radically over many years, with little success. Monetary
targets have regularly been missed. Decisions are made in secret, and are
seldom explained, so market doubts go unanswered.
Monetary targets will now take the place of exchange rate discipline; but
the same forces which have driven Britain out of the ERM will make monetary
control more difficult. International flows distort the monetary aggregates
in ways which are not yet fully understood, and floating exchange rates have
proved very hard to stabilise.
The government further proposes that targets should include not only the
exchange rate, but also broad and narrow measures of money, and housing and
other asset prices. These indicators look well chosen, and would have
alerted the authorities to many recent problems. But though the approach is
described as new, it is essentially the traditional British system, and
revives an old problem.
It is impossible to keep multiple targets always in the sights of a single
weapon, the interest rate regime. Something on the list will always look out
of line; and sometimes objectives will be incompatible, as they are now.
Policy cannot both support the exchange rate, and reduce real interest rates
so as to relieve debtors and restore the growth of credit and money. Policy
must be a compromise.
Market acceptance will, therefore, depend on restoring confidence in
official judgment. That is the aim of our proposal: to enable the markets to
monitor the reasoning behind policy decisions, and to strengthen the policy
process by bringing in well-regarded outsiders.
Proposal: the UK should set up an Open Market Committee (OMC), similar to
the FOMC of the US Federal Reserve. This would have full executive
responsibility for monetary policy.
At the moment the chancellor is nominally responsible, but the Bank and
Number 10 Downing Street make their own inputs. When any policy fails, the
buck passes rapidly round this triangle; this may be intended to protect
reputations, but further undermines confidence. An OMC could not disown its
decisions in this way;
Publication: honest differences of opinion will always arise in matters of
policy. The market is likely to have more confidence in decisions - even
those which prove mistaken - if it knows what facts and interpretations were
involved in reaching them.
The minutes of the OMC should, therefore, be published after a minimum
delay, as are those of the FOMC (six weeks in arrears). They should report
the sometimes dissenting views expressed in reaching a decision, and should
also include the committee's assessment of each of the indicators for
policy, with full explanation if any is judged misleading at the time. We
believe that disclosure on these lines would increase market confidence,
partly by reducing uncertainty;
Outside directors: British monetary policy is managed by a committee of Bank
and Treasury officials. It usually maintains an outside appearance of
unanimity and confidence. This has never been fully convincing; at a time
when policy has gone off the rails, and leaks tell of furious internal
arguments (as after every British crisis), the pretence simply undermines
confidence further.
Compared with this, the federal structure of the US and German central banks
has important advantages. The heads of the Fed districts and the Landesbanks
have their own power base, their own local information, and they often hold
strongly independent views which are widely known. This assures markets that
policy decisions are fully informed and largely politician-proof. It would
be hard to imitate such a structure in the UK; but some of the same
advantages could be secured by including outside directors or advisers in
the OMC. These 'non-executive directors' should not be officials either of
the Bank or of the Treasury. As 'insiders', they could not be active in the
City during their time on the OMC.
They would have a threefold role: to ensure that policy-making is fully
informed about private-sector views and problems; to ensure that the OMC
minutes convey meaningful information about policy decisions; and to act as
potential whistle-blowers if they strongly disagree with the OMC consensus.
They should be encouraged to propound and debate policy in public, as do the
directors of the Fed and the Bundesbank;
Execution: the OMC would steer policy, and answer for it; but day-to-day
execution would remain in the hands of the Bank.
We believe this structure would improve the operations of an independent
Bank of England. It would be even more important if the Bank is not made
formally independent.

FT  07 OCT 92 / BA launches Pounds 80m investment programme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday launched a Pounds 80m investment programme aimed
at improving its transcontinental business class and Concorde services.
The revamp, which is the first for five years, will include eight-channel
personal video screens, more spacious seats and better lounge facilities for
those travelling business class.
BA, with other large airlines, has been hit during the recession by
companies sending their executives by economy class rather than business
class.
BA's passenger numbers have risen by 8.7 per cent this year compared with
figures for last year, which were hit by the Gulf war.
However, the growth has been mainly among economy-class passengers. Many of
these passengers are on heavily discounted tickets.
Under the re-launch, BA plans to refit all 6,000 of its business-class seats
on its fleet of 71 long-haul aircraft over the next year.

FT  07 OCT 92 / BA steps up fight to gain stake in USAir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS yesterday stepped up pressure on the US government to
approve its Dollars 750m (Pounds 421.30m) investment for a 44 per cent stake
in USAir, warning that rejection of the deal would have severe consequences
for airline de-regulation.
Sir Colin Marshall, BA's deputy chairman and chief executive, said
'non-approval by the US would create a response of a fortress mentality in
the UK and elsewhere and put back the course of deregulation for many
years.'
Sir Colin said his airline would fight vigorously 'for our right to make a
legitimate investment in USAir'.
His warning coincided with the start of a new round of negotiations in
Washington between the US and the UK over the BA deal.
Last week BA announced services from Birmingham to New York and from
Manchester to Los Angeles which are expected to intensify still further
competition across the Atlantic.
The US authorities are now coming under intense pressure from the three
largest US carriers - American Airlines, United Airlines, and Delta Air
Lines - to block the BA-USAir deal unless they can secure from the British
government greater access for the three US carriers in the UK and
continental European markets.
The UK government is prepared to negotiate a new 'open skies' bilateral
agreement with the US, but it has so far opposed linking the BA-USAir deal
with a new bilateral aviation accord between the two countries.
Airline industry officials yesterday warned that the issue risked becoming a
cause celebre if the US government rejected the BA-USAir deal. However, BA
is still hoping to secure US approval for the deal before the transaction's
deadline of December 24.
BA could consider taking legal action in the US high court if the deal is
blocked.
Sir Colin said: 'Our plan falls firmly within prevailing US regulations and
there is no legitimate ground for non-approval in Washington.'
He also argued that the balance weighed heavily in favour of US airlines
which could operate from 771 points in the US to the UK, while BA operated
from seven points in the UK to 20 in the US.
Sir Colin said: 'The big three US carriers control 60 per cent of the US
market, which accounts for 40 per cent of world air travel, while the UK
accounts for just over 3 per cent of world travel.'
The US carriers argue that the current bilateral agreement gives BA an
advantage by restricting their access to the UK.

FT  07 OCT 92 / BR privatisation plans run into difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT proposals for the privatisation of British Rail have run into
serious difficulties over plans to split the ownership of the tracks from
the operation of trains.
The Department of Transport is facing the possibility of rail freight
switching to road, branch lines closing, government subsidies rising and
competition failing to materialise.
Ministers' plans, set out in a white paper in July, are that ownership of
the tracks should be left with a BR residuary body called Railtrack and that
the private sector would take over operation of trains.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is expected this afternoon to tell
the Conservative party conference that private-sector companies are queueing
up to become train operators once the sell-off legislation has gone through.
But the Department of Transport has yet to tell would-be train operators how
much they will have to pay for access to Railtrack's lines or how much
competition they will face from other companies running the same routes.
In the next few days the department is to test the market, asking potential
train operators to say what services they would like to run and how much
they would be prepared to pay. The results will be fed into a study by the
consultancy arm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, which the
government has commissioned to devise a system of charging train operators
for use of the tracks.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand is not expected to produce its report until the end of the
year, but it is understood to have told the Department of Transport that it
has identified a number of serious problems:
Freight traffic could switch from rail to road because some customers may
not be able to afford Railtrack's fees.
Branch lines in Scotland, Wales and Cornwall could close because the system
of charging will expose the scale of their losses to uncomfortable levels of
public scrutiny.
Government subsidies may go up instead of down because private-sector train
operators will cream off lucrative services, leaving the state to subsidise
the loss makers.
Competition between train operators could be almost non-existent because
companies will bid for train service franchises only if they are guaranteed
exclusivity.
The government had hoped to introduce a rail privatisation bill in November
and win royal assent for it by next summer, but the emerging difficulties
threaten to delay the bill into the next session.

FT  07 OCT 92 / MMI to resume payment of claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUNICIPAL MUTUAL Insurance, which that ceased underwriting new business last
week, is to resume payment of claims, the group announced yesterday.
The insurance company imposed a seven-day moratorium on claims when it
closed for new business last Wednesday.
Mr Brian Wright, chief executive, said the decision had allowed MMI to 'take
stock of the situation' after the breakdown of efforts to sell the group to
the Paris-based La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires.
MMI, which insures nine out of 10 local authorities, has been hit by rising
claims on its liability business. It recorded losses of more than Pounds
250m last year and has been seeking to transfer its council, personal,
health, life and pensions business to another company since May.
Mr Wright said: 'It is now clear that a number of parties are interested in
purchasing various parts of the group.' MMI is also in discussions with
councils and the Department of Trade and Industry, which regulates the UK
insurance industry.
'What MMI now needs is a settled period in which we can take these
discussions forward,' Mr Wright said. 'We will make further announcements
when appropriate.'
General Accident, the Perth-based insurer, agreed in principle last week to
acquire a block of 216,000 MMI insurance policies - about a fifth of MMI's
total portfolio of individual policies. These were sold by the Cheltenham &amp;
Gloucester Building Society to its mortgage lenders.
Local authority associations yesterday cautiously welcomed the MMI
announcement.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Fall in new car sales continues with 4% drop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK car industry plunged deeper into gloom yesterday as statistics for
September showed sales of new cars continuing to slide.
Official figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders showed
sales down 4 per cent last month compared with a year ago to 121,823 from
126,906. But many yesterday acknowledged that the underlying situation was
considerably worse.
The market was down by nearly 20 per cent about two thirds of the way
through the month, and the last-minute upsurge is believed to represent
dealer registrations by manufacturers seeking to boost market share. Total
registrations for the first three quarters are 1,297,423 - 2.62 per cent
below last year.
The resumed fall has left manufacturers seeking further ways of tempting
buyers. Ford this week began a price-cutting campaign on 1992 models.
Manufacturers and dealers are wondering whether even market forecasts of
1.55m units this year - down from forecasts of 1.7m or higher made in
January - might not prove optimistic. In spite of economic uncertainty and
political turmoil, some industry leaders were putting on a brave face.
Mr John Towers, managing director of Rover Group, said at the Paris motor
show that sales could recover to 1.65m or even 1.7m units next year. He
said: 'Once we break through the consumer confidence barrier, then quite
clearly there could be a lot of movement in the market.'
Rover was one of the winners last month. It secured a 15.13 per cent market
share, up 4 percentage points on last year, and for the first time in many
months narrowly beat Vauxhall into second place behind Ford.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Former Maxwell director charged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT BUNN, a former finance director of Robert Maxwell's group of
private companies, yesterday became the fourth man to be arrested and
charged with fraud following the Serious Fraud Office investigation into the
collapse of the late publisher's business empire.
Mr Bunn was arrested by City of London police yesterday morning and charged
with a single count of conspiracy to defraud.
He was released on police bail to face City of London magistrates on
December 1. He will appear with Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell, and Mr
Larry Trachtenberg - a financial adviser to Robert Maxwell - who jointly
face 15 counts of theft and conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 135m.
The full charge against Mr Bunn is that between November 1 1990 and December
31 1991 he conspired with others to defraud a syndicate of 35 banks led by
Swiss Bank Corporation and Credit Lyonnais by knowingly and dishonestly
being a party to the pledging of common stock in Berlitz International Inc
by way of security for loans to third parties in breach of terms of a loan
agree ment dated October 23 1989 between the syndicate and Maxwell
Communication Corporation.
Unlike the June arrests of the two Maxwell brothers and Mr Trachtenberg  -
when police raided the men's homes early in the morning amid a blaze of
publicity - Mr Bunn's arrest, at Snow Hill police station in the City, was
low-key. After his arrest, Mr Bunn, who lives in the City, declined to
comment. 'Mr Bunn will have no comment to make before his trial,' said his
solicitor, Mr Jeffrey Bayes of Burton Copefield.
Mr Bunn, who was finance director of Maxwell Communication Corporation, was
also a director of Bishopsgate Investment management until September 1990.
In May last year he was appointed to the board of London and Bishopsgate
International Investment. Mr Kevin Maxwell yesterday failed in his second
High Court attempt to win a judicial review of the Serious Fraud Office's
refusal to disclose documentary evidence of the case against him.
Mr Maxwell, who faces charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud, had
claimed the SFO was acting unlawfully and unfairly in not disclosing such
evidence before questioning him under powers which remove the right to
silence.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Advertising by banks 'wasted'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and building societies are wasting millions of pounds a year on
advertising, Mintel, the market research group, claims in a report published
today.
It says that customers are more influenced by other factors. For example,
Mintel says, most people choose their bank or building society according to
its location or the recommendation of a friend rather than as a result of
advertising.
Mintel says in a report compiled from a survey of 1,000 adults that 43 per
cent of account holders base their choice of bank or building society on its
proximity to their homes. Two out of five chose the same institutions as
their parents, 15 per cent listened to the recommendation of a friend and
only 5 per cent said they were affected by advertising or by direct
mailshots.
Mintel found, that people aged 15 to 19 are more likely than other age
groups to be influenced by advertising, with 13 per cent admitting they were
affected by advertising. However 32 per cent said they chose the same bank
as their parents.
The importance for the banks and building societies in catching customers
when they are young is borne out by the survey, which showed that most
people stayed with the institution at which they first opened an account.
Customer Service in Personal Finance, Myth or Reality? Mintel International
Group, 18-19 Long Lane, London EC1A 9HE. Pounds 895.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Longer leading index falls
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S longer leading index, which pinpoints turning points in economic
activity 10 months in advance by tracking a number of different economic
indicators, fell for the third consecutive month in August, suggesting that
the recovery is not yet under way.
The shorter leading index, which highlights turning points about four months
in advance, suggests more optimistic prospects for the economy. It has risen
steadily since the beginning of the year.
The Central Statistical Office said the 0.3 per cent fall in the longer
leading indicator mainly reflected a fall in share prices.

FT  07 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo seven-day losing
streak ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE share prices broke a seven-day losing streak to end firmer, buoyed
by index buying by investment trusts late in the afternoon. Earlier in the
day, the turmoil on overseas equity markets had pushed the Nikkei average
below the psychologically important 17,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue index closed 166.60 higher at 17,268.10. It fell to the day's
low of 16.901.60 in the early afternoon on arbitrage unwinding, but later
rose to the day's high of 17,318.66.
Volume rose to 220m shares from 182m. However, investor interest remained
low and fluctuations in overseas financial markets were used as excuses to
remain on the sidelines.
In spite of the rise in the index, declines led advances by 461 to 434 with
175 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks
gained 6.42 to 1,299.13 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 1.30 to
1036.58.
Analysts said that uncertainty about earnings growth prospects made share
prices look overvalued. The Tokyo market is currently trading at a
price-earnings ratio of around 46. Mr Jason James, strategist at James
Capel, said that after the announcement of the government's economic
emergency package, investors had pushed up share prices without firm
evidence of a fundamental improvement. 'The euphoria has been dissipated by
doubts about the effects of the package on the economy, and the bank bailout
scheme,' he said.
Most market participants believe that fears ahead of the forthcoming interim
earnings announcements could drag the average lower. However, public funds
and bargain-hunting by investors who missed the September rally are expected
to support the index at lower levels.
Activity centred around short-term theme stocks. Aids-related issues were
higher, with Green Cross, the most active issue of the day, up Y90 to
Y1,630. Mazda Motor, which is planning to announce its new rotary engine
today, rose Y10 to Y450.
Denki Kogyo, a telecommunications antenna maker, rose Y29 to Y759 on active
buying. The company is reported to be involved in Aisin Seiki's nuclear
fusion research programme. But Aisin Seiki, which had risen on its reported
success of nuclear fusion at room temperature, lost Y30 to Y1,010 on
profit-taking.
Export-oriented, high-technology issues, which had weakened on the yen's
strength, were mixed. Hitachi declined Y1 to Y739 and NEC fell Y4 to Y695,
while Toshiba gained Y1 to Y566.
In Osaka, the OSE average advanced 41.34 to 18,758.72 in volume of 8.7m
shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets were mostly lower as sharp falls in Europe depressed
sentiment.
TAIWAN fell as September inflation data registered an 11-year high of 7.36
per cent. The weighted index lost 157.58 or 4.2 per cent to 3,562.87 in
turnover of TDollars 17.3bn.
News that a director of Formosan Rubber had been arrested over allegations
of insider trading also affected sentiment. Formosan Rubber closed down
TDollars 7 at TDollars 96.
HONG KONG remained nervous following Monday's holiday, but came off the
day's lows on late bargain-hunting. The Hang Seng index lost 42.32 to
5,553.12, having plunged 154 points soon after the opening. Turnover was
HKDollars 1.7bn.
HSBC Holdings lost 50 cents to HKDollars 55 and Hongkong Land rose 10 cents
to HKDollars 13.1.
AUSTRALIA ended at a new 18-month closing low. The All Ordinaries index fell
to 1,447.9 in early trading but closed 14.7 down at 1,452.4, the lowest
close since April 10, 1991.
A note of optimism crept in late in the day with a ADollars 50m buy
portfolio handled by First State Securities. A total of 77.7m shares worth
ADollars 179.7m were traded before the portfolio was put through the system.
BANGKOK lost 1.4 per cent in active trading. The SET index shed 12.08 to
865.52 in turnover of Bt12.4bn. Declines led advances by 182 to 60 with 42
shares unchanged.
Bangkok Land fell Bt3 to Bt140, Bangkok Bank Bt1.50 to Bt85.00 and Thai
Airways International Bt1.00 to Bt55.50.
SEOUL was lifted by intervention by the Stabilisation Fund which helped to
keep the market above the 500-level. The composite index rose 5.54 to 507.76
in turnover of Won106.7bn. Advancing issues led declines by 423 to 256 with
167 unchanged.
NEW ZEALAND closed below 1,400 for the first time since mid-April and ended
only 25 points off the low for 1992 set on April 9. The NZSE-40 index closed
15.83 lower at 1,396.16 in turnover of NZDollars 19m.
Brierley Investments was the weakest of the leaders, ending 3 cents lower at
its year's low of 82 cents.
KUALA LUMPUR closed off the day's lows as a rebound in Tokyo prompted some
bargain-hunting in the afternoon. The composite index closed down 3.63 at
590.70. But trading was thin as investors kept to the sidelines ahead of
Malaysia's 1993 budget on October 30.
BOMBAY fell on what one broker described as 'the tremendous pressure of
rights issues', the BSE index closing 67.96 lower at 3,247.76.
Merchant bankers and stockbrokers estimate that Indian companies are
planning to raise up to Rs100bn (Dollars 3.5bn) in the next six months.

FT  07 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow supported by hopes of a
rate cut
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US MARKETS settled down with share prices holding their ground amid mounting
speculation about a possible interest rate cut, writes Patrick Harverson in
New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 0.81 at 3,178.19, the
index having spent all but the first few minutes of the day only a few
points either side of Monday's close.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 was also virtually unchanged at
the finish, down 0.41 at 407.16, while the Amex composite added 1.09 at
367.71 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 5.34 to 570.55. Turnover on the New
York SE was 197m shares, and rises outpaced declines by 1033 to 727.
Although the concerns about the economy and corporate earnings that were
behind Monday's volatility were still dogging the market, investors switched
their attention yesterday to the Federal Reserve's open market committee
(FOMC), and prospects for a cut in interest rates.
There was no sign from the committee of any policy shift yesterday, but many
analysts were predicting that the FOMC would agree to a 25 basis-point cut
in the federal funds rate, or a 50 basis point cut in the more important
discount rate, or both. Normally, such predictions would have stimulated
anticipatory buying, but in light of the market's unstable mood, investors
were holding off until they had proof that rates were being cut.
Among individual stocks, Citicorp dropped Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 in
turnover of 3.3m shares after the bank announced that its third quarter
profits would come in between eight cents and 13 cents a share, well below
analysts' expectations. The stock's fall also represented investor concern
about the sudden departure of the banking group's president, Mr Richard
Braddock, who resigned on Monday night.
Advanced Micro was one of the day's best performers, advancing Dollars 1 1/8
to Dollars 12 7/8 in turnover of 2.9m shares after the company unveiled
third quarter net income of 51 cents a share, up sharply from the 16 cents a
share of a year ago. Advanced Micro also said that it expected profits to
grow even faster in the fourth quarter.
Tyco Toys dropped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 13 3/8 in heavy trading after an
analyst at the broking house Salomon Brothers, downgraded the stock from a
'buy' to a 'hold' and cut his 1992 and 1993 earnings estimates, citing weak
retail sales, an unfavourable sales mix and rising advertising costs.
On the Nasdaq market, some of the leading stocks which tumbled on Monday
bounced back, including Microsoft, up Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 82 1/2 and
Amgen Dollars 1 1/4 higher at Dollars 60 3/4 .
Optrotech dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 12 1/4 after the Federal Trade
Commission asked the company to delay its merger with Orbot Systems because
of concerns about the effect of the link-up on competition.
Canada
TORONTO stocks broke a week-long down fallending with marginal gains after a
day of cautious trade, dealers said.
After losing more than 150 points last week,
the TSE 300 closed up 1.96 points at 3,229.49, after swinging within a
21-point range in the morning. Volume was 25.5m and transactions were valued
at CDollars 371 m.

FT  07 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: S. African equities weaken
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE fall in South African equities slowed yesterday, in the wake of the 2.8
per cent fall in the overall index on Monday, John Pitt writes.
However, some analysts said that the trend was still downward and forecast
that prices could lose a further 10 to 15 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Gold shares, which had been boosted by a weak financial rand on Monday, lost
ground as the quarterly reporting session began with publication of interim
figures from Gold Fields. The gold index lost 7 to 895. The overall index
fell 10 to 3,103 while industrials shed 15 to 4,088.
The announcement by De Beers that it was considering retrenchment at its
local mining operations because of the depressed state of the diamond market
took the shares to an intraday low of R47.50.
Late bargain hunting lifted the price to R48.25 for a gain of 40 cents, but
the share price was still 48 per cent below its level six months ago.
Some brokers remain sellers of the stock, because 1992 sales are likely to
be the lowest for five years.

FT  07 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Currency effect assists in
Eurotrack recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES generally recovered from the depths they hit on Monday afternoon,
when the Dow dropped 100 points in early trading, writes Our Markets Staff.
However, the 1.8 per cent rise in the FT-SE Eurotrack 100 index, which is
expressed in terms of D-Marks, also owed something to the recovery of other
currencies against their German counterpart.
FRANKFURT's recovery was not immediately apparent, as the DAX index closed
down 4.10 at a new 1992 closing low of 1,420.30, but dealers noted that
there had been an indicated break below 1,400 in the post-bourse on Monday.
There was no obvious pattern, either, to individual or sector share price
levels. In carmakers, after Monday's earnings downgrades and general gloom,
BMW recovered DM7 to DM460 and Continental, an industry supplier, by DM4.50
to DM194.50; but Daimler dropped DM7.50 to DM525.50 and Volkswagen by DM4.60
to DM258.60.
Similarly, in chemicals BASF gained DM3.40 marks to DM204 while Bayer and
Hoechst were both slightly lower. A 0.4 per cent fall in western German
manufacturing orders in August did nothing to brighten the outlook.
Siemens slipped DM7.40 to DM546.00. The company said yesterday that its
automation division had produced lower profits for 1991-92, but gave no
specific figures.
PARIS had another volatile day, the CAC-40 index dipping as low as 1,586.11
before ending 1.47 better at 1,612.51. Turnover was moderate at FFr2.6bn,
and trading was dominated by arbitrage activity.
Hachette surged 20.2 per cent or FFr23.80 to FFr141.80 on speculation about
the share parity when the media company is merged with its sister company,
Matra.
Other gainers included Total, up FFr7.20 or 3.6 per cent to FFr205.60, on
bargain-hunting in the wake of its recent weakness.
Eurotunnel slowed after Monday's sharp fall, closing FFr1.10 lower at
FFr29.25.
AMSTERDAM was broadly positive, and the CBS Tendency index ended 1.6 or 1.5
per cent higher at 107.7.
DAF rose on publication of an interview with the group's chairman but
subsided later as investors found little new in the comments. It closed up
60 cents at Fl 12.60.
Heineken, Fl 2.10 better at Fl 167.30, was boosted by its decision to
initiate exports to Germany in the new year. However, James Capel reiterated
a hold note yesterday, forecasting 'a noticeable slowdown in earnings growth
over the next 12 months'.
MILAN ended widely mixed in a session dominated by speculative buying of a
number of potential takeover stocks. Dealers added that some institutions
used yesterday's technical bounce to continue to lighten their positions.
The Comit index rose 2.74 to 361.11 in turnover estimated at L120bn after
L111.7bn.
Speculation that Fiat would sell off non-core assets to strengthen its
balance sheet sent the retailer Rinascente and Snia BPD, a diversified
chemical group, sharply higher. Rinascente soared L410 or 10 per cent to
L4,460 while Snia also added 10 per cent or L75 to L805 at its official
fixing, though it fell back to L765 later.
Stet recovered L45 or 4.3 per cent to L1,080 after Monday's heavy fall.
MADRID took heart after the government said that it was not planning to
raise interest rates in the short term. The general index rose 3.67 to
183.15. Banks were boosted by BBV's decision to increase its quarterly
dividend by Pta2 to Pta38 as its shares rose Pta75 to Pta2,015.
STOCKHOLM featured a SKr7.50 gain to SKr48 for Proventus B after the
investment company proposed redeeming outstanding shares at SKr50. The
Affarsvarlden General index rose 4.1 to 643.1 in turnover of SKr422m after
SKr443m.
In the forestry sector, Stora B shares dropped another SKr10 to SKr165
following its earnings report on Monday.
ZURICH liked the drop in the Swiss inflation rate, which fed through into
lower domestic interest rates, higher bank shares and a recovery in the SMI
index of 33.2, or 1.9 per cent to 1,820.5. UBS rose SFr12 to SFr766, and SBC
SFr6 to SFr275.
HELSINKI saw a sharp fall in bank shares as the Hex index closed 6.4 lower
at 603.1. The banks and finance index dropped another 19.3 per cent, KOP
free shares falling FM1.2 to FM3.8 and Unitas B FM1.6 to FM2.7.
After hours it was reported that IBCA, a ratings agency, might cut its
ratings on Kop, Unitas and Postipankki.
Bank and shipping shares led COPENHAGEN lower as the all-share index fell
3.28 to 258.02, writes Hilary Barnes. Danske Bank was down DKr8 to DKr226
and Unidanmark fell DKr5 to DKr111. AP Moller's D/S 1912 B fell DKr1,000 to
DKr71,800.
VIENNA remained in an uncertain mood as the ATX index eased 0.90 to 768.55.
Austrian Airlines was one of the day's main gainers, up Sch50 or 2.6 per
cent at Sch1,920.
ISTANBUL retreated 2.7 per cent to its second consecutive three-month low as
the release of disappointing inflation data on Sunday continued to weigh on
sentiment. The 75-share index fell 105.12 to 3,814.18.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in the sterling money market eased yesterday as dealers again
took the view that there could be a cut in UK base rates in the immediate
future.
On Monday, sterling's dramatic fall on the foreign exchanges to a low of
DM2.3690 made dealers very bearish about the possibility of a cut.
However, the currency rebounded in Asia and Europe yesterday, peaking at
DM2.4548 at the start of London trading.
This triggered renewed speculation of a rate cut being announced to coincide
with the chancellor's speech at the Conservative Party conference on
Thursday.
Views on whether the government could cut rates were mixed. One clearing
bank dealer said that the government could not afford another cut unless
sterling first rebounded above DM2.50. Another suggested that a  1/2 point
cut in rates could even trigger a sterling rally because the small size
would show the markets that the government had not thrown caution to the
winds.
Either way, dealers remained confused because of the uncertainty about the
government's economic strategy. One discount house dealer said: 'We ought to
have 8 or 8 1/2 per cent base rates before the end of the year. What we
don't know is when the cuts will come.'
Three month sterling cash closed at 9 1/8 per cent on the offered side from
a previous close of 9 3/16 per cent. One month money also closed softer at 9
5/16 per cent from a previous close of 9 1/2 per cent. The December short
sterling contract also registered the more favourable outlook on rates
closing up 7 basis points at 91.76.
The Bank of England's discount house operations reflected the paucity of
bills held by discount houses and clearing banks after the huge shortages
that have followed the Bank's 'Black Wednesday' intervention. A shortage of
Pounds 1.4bn proved to be 'sticky' and late assistance of Pounds 435m was
offered.
The Bank purchased Pounds 124m in a repurchase agreement (repo) at 8 15/16
per cent. The forecast was revised to Pounds 1.5bn and the Bank purchased
Pounds 23m of Band 1 Treasury bills and Pounds 53m of Band 1 bank bills at 8
7/8 per cent and Pounds 136m in a 'repo.' In the afternoon, the Bank
purchased Pounds 525m of Band 1 bank bills.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Astonishment at lira's moves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSIONS both inside and outside the European exchange rate mechanism eased
yesterday, as sterling regained ground against the D-Mark and the Italian
lira staged an extraordinary recovery, writes James Blitz.
After Monday's huge falls in the value of most currencies against the
D-Mark, there was some selling of the German currency yesterday. Some
dealers suggested that the buying of D-Marks on Monday may have been
overdone, while others said that yesterday's rebound reflected short term
profit-taking by speculators.
The Federal Open Markets Committee meeting produced no cut in the Federal
Reserve's discount rate on the first day of its two-day meeting, suggesting
that the all-important differential between US and German interest rates is
not about to widen.
The Bundesbank also highlighted the one accommodating part of its monetary
policy, by again adding liquidity to the German money market at a fixed rate
of 8.9 per cent, 60 basis points below the Lombard rate. Although there is
no sign of a cut in official rates, Eurodeutschmark futures continued to
price in another cut in German rates before the end of the year.
These factors combined to push the dollar up to a high of DM1.4320 yesterday
after the US currency had come close to its historic low of DM1.3860 on
Monday. It later closed in London at DM1.4300, up more than 2 pfennigs on
the day.
Mr Jim O'Neill, head of research at Swiss Banking Corporation in London, has
been bearish about the dollar in recent weeks and confessed himself
surprised by the market's optimism. He expects the dollar to trade in a
range of DM1.40 to DM1.45 in the coming weeks.
In Europe, the D-Mark's weakness produced gyrations in the Italian lira of a
kind that have rarely been seen in a European currency.
The lira closed in London on Monday night at L934.4 to the D-Mark, 5 per
cent down on the day. Yesterday, it slumped another 6 per cent, bottoming
out at L985. But in the European afternoon, it regained nearly 8 per cent in
value to peak at L910. As Mr O'Neill put it: 'In one day the lira has moved
over twice the ground that would have separated its upper and lower limits
in the ERM.' The recovery was attributed to short covering, and there was no
intervention from the Bank of Italy. It closed at L916.2 against the D-Mark.
Sterling recovered on a less dramatic scale, though its rebound was
sufficient to renew suggestions that the UK chancellor may cut base rates
this week.
Sterling reached a high of DM2.4548 at the start of European trading
yesterday, although that peak was never regained in the rest of the day. The
pound closed at DM2.4475, up 5 1/2 pfennigs on the day.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: PaineWebber and Samuel
Montagu to co-operate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US SECURITIES house PaineWebber and the London-based merchant bank Samuel
Montagu yesterday announced plans to co-operate in the transatlantic mergers
and acquisitions business.
The idea is to give Paine-Webber's US clients access to strategic investors,
acquisition candidates and merger partners or acquirers in Europe, while
offering similar access in the US to Samuel Montagu's customers. The two
companies' corporate finance departments
PaineWebber has been looking to build a presence in Europe, particularly in
the European bond markets. The deal will also enable Samuel Montagu to
expand its horizons into the US. During the 1980s, Samuel Montagu - now part
of Hong Kong Shanghai Banking Corporation - had a reputation for working on
ambitious M&amp;A deals, such as bids by UK advertising group WPP for rival US
companies Ogilvy &amp; Mather and JWT.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Sterling's rally encourages short and
medium gilts

<TEXT>
A RALLY in sterling lifted prices in the short and medium-dated gilts,
though the long end of the market remained in the doldrums.
Dealers said yesterday's improvement was partly a technical correction after
the market was oversold on Monday.
Trading conditions proved volatile yesterday, with the long gilt future
opening up  11/32 at 95.16, before falling back to close at 94.30. But the
shorter end of the market performed well, recording gains of as much as  3/8
point.
'Sterling holds the key at the moment,' said Mr Phillip Tyson, an economist
at UBS Phillips and Drew.
The improvement in sterling revived hopes that a further reduction in
interest rates would be possible sooner rather than later.
The short sterling contract on the London International Financial Futures
Exchange gained 6 basis points to close at 91.75.
However, dealers expected trading conditions to remain volatile at least
until firm details of the government's economic policy emerge following
sterling's withdrawal from the exchange rate mechanism.
The market will listen keenly to the Chancellor of the Exchequer's speech
tomorrow for hints of the form the new economic policy will take.
HIGH-YIELDING European bond markets continued their meteoric fall yesterday.
Italian government bonds shed 1 1/2 points, as the lira dived yesterday
morning, but recovered some ground later in the day.
Spanish bonds fared poorly, recording losses of 1 3/8 points. Non-resident
selling pressure pushed prices down further, as fears of a peseta
devaluation and worries about the lifting of capital controls depressed
sentiment further. Dealers said liquidity in the Spanish bond market was
particularly poor.
GERMAN bund prices were forced to surrender some of the gains that they made
on Monday, ending  1/4 point lower.
Dealers said the market had got ahead of itself, but sentiment remained
positive. The new 10-year 7 1/4 per cent bund issue met firm demand, dealers
said. The results are due to be announced today.
Although the rush of buying seen on Monday appeared to have dried up, German
bunds are expected to retain their safe haven status, since economic
fundamentals remain favourable. The German bund future on Liffe closed at
91.38, down from Monday's close of 91.70.
DUTCH bonds fell back after their opening rise, following a steep fall in
German bund futures.
Dealers said bond prices had gone too high and fell back as stock market
turbulence faded. An increased supply from tap issue had also brought prices
down, dealers said.
BELGIUM will issue a new state loan aimed at private investors between
November 12 and November 18, the Belgian Finance Ministry said, Reuter
reports from Brussels.
The maturity, coupon and issue price will be set later. The previous state
loan in June raised BFr58.5bn and one in February brought in BFr66bn.
FRENCH bond prices fell a further half point yesterday, as benefits from the
fall in stock prices on Monday evaporated. Dealers said the concerns of
currency weakness continued to preoccupy the market. The OAT future on the
Matif ended 0.58 point down at 108.56.
JAPANESE bonds again performed inversely to the stock market, gaining ground
during early stock market weakness, then falling back when equity prices
rallied later in the day. The JGB future on Liffe ended unchanged at 106.87,
in thin trade.
LONGER-DATED US Treasury prices fell sharply yesterday on disappointment
that the Federal Reserve's monthly federal open market committee (FOMC),
which met during the day, did not ease monetary policy to help the ailing
economy.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  13/16 at
98, yielding 7.411 per cent. The two-year note was also lower, down 1/8 at
100 17/32 to carry a yield of 3.735 per cent.
In the absence of economic news, the market's attention was focused on
yesterday's FOMC meeting. Speculation has mounted in recent days that the
FOMC would sanction another cut in interest rates (possibly a 25 basis-point
reduction in the federal funds rate and a 50 basis-point reduction in the
discount rate) to lift the apparently stalled economic recovery.
A policy ease has been partly discounted by the market, and the lack of a
move from the Fed yesterday meant that some of those gains had to be given
back.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Bank cancels tender of Ecu
Treasury notes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England has cancelled its tender of three-year Ecu Treasury
notes scheduled for October 20, citing the tensions in the Ecu market. It
had become clear in recent weeks that demand for the notes would be
negligible, according to traders.
However, an Ecu1bn issue of T-bills is going ahead as planned on October 13.
The Bank hopes to resume its T-note issuance programme if market conditions
improve. The next issue is due in January.
The T-bill auction next Tuesday will consist of Ecu300m each of one-month
and three-month bills and Ecu400m of six-month bills. The T-bill auction is
expected to meet satisfactory demand, partly because market conditions are
rather better at shorter maturities. In addition, the issue represents a
refinancing of maturing T-bills, rather than a fresh supply of paper, as in
case of the notes.
Meanwhile, trading in the Ecu bond market has virtually stalled. Bond prices
dropped a further  3/8 point yesterday in lacklustre trading, and volume in
the Ecu bond futures contract on the Matif in Paris reached only 1,700
contracts.
The only area of activity is asset-swapping (the exchange of fixed-rate for
floating-rate assets), which is providing some support for the market.
Goldman Sachs has stripped a further Ecu100m tranche of Italy's Ecu2.5bn
issue of 9 1/4 per cent bonds due 2011. A total of Ecu500m of the issue has
now been stripped. The Italian deal has been one of the worst performers in
a generally weak market, partly because asset-swaps cannot be executed at
the long-end of the market. The bonds currently yield 10.78 per cent.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Equity Issues: Large issues go ahead despite
market gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE international share issues expected to be priced over the next week
are said to be attracting interest in spite of acute uneasiness in stock
markets and recent cancellations.
In general, offerings have been hit by the swings in currencies and falls in
the European markets. Consequently, hybrid offerings which offer more
security, such as convertible bonds, are attracting more interest and many
straight equity issues are being put off until the new year.
The flotations of Procordia, the Swedish state food and pharmaceutical
group, and the Australian Woolworths subsidiary, have been postponed because
of poor market conditions over the past fortnight.
However, a Dollars 690m issue by debt-laden News Corporation and a Dollars
525m issue by General Motors remain on schedule, according to the New York
securities house Merrill Lynch, which is heading both projects. Meanwhile, a
Dollars 550m secondary issue of Union Texas Petroleum stock has been filed
with the US Securities Exchange Commission.
The News Corp offer of 40m new shares, including 18m to be sold in the US
and Canada, is the most international of the three, but potentially the most
difficult.
The Australian market is expected to attract about 13m of the shares but has
been dogged by the failure of a ADollars 1.2bn rights issue by Westpac and
the postponing by Industrial Equity (IEL) of the ADollars 2bn flotation of
its Woolworths retailing subsidiary.
Nevertheless, analysts feel that publisher Mr Rupert Murdoch's credibility
has improved strongly over the past year.
The other two issues are essentially US offerings with an international
element. General Motors is to offer 25m 'H' shares, which will track the
performance of the subsidiary Hughes Electronics. Some 20 per cent of the
shares are allocated outside the US, although it is felt that as much as 95
per cent of the shares could go to US investors.
Goldman Sachs's expected offer of 30m shares in Union Texas is principally
targeted at the US with 20 per cent reserved for the rest of the world. The
shares represent the 39 per cent stake held by Allied Signals.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Coming to terms with conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international bond market took a breather yesterday as borrowers,
investors and intermediaries came to terms with what were claimed to be the
worst conditions in the primary and secondary markets for several years.
Upheaval in the currency markets, unsold bonds from recent large dollar
issues, a queue of sovereign borrowers planning large borrowings and a
dearth of institutional buyers have all conspired to push out spreads on
Eurobonds.
The gloom over the market intensified with speculation that the Republic of
Finland was preparing a Dollars 2bn global bond issue. Sweden was among
Scandinavian borrowers said to be considering a large bond issue, along with
Italy, though recent negative statements by Moody's, the rating agency,
makes both unlikely.
After a Y75bn deal from Finland, launched on Monday, had been undermined by
a warning from the country's finance minster about the serious state of the
government's finances, traders were in no mood yesterday for another, even
bigger issue from the country. The Y75bn issue broke syndicate yesterday
morning, and was said by the lead manager to be trading at 99.10 on the bid
late in the afternoon, down from the 99.35 issue price but still within
fees.
'The best thing that could happen now is if the market closed down for a
week,' said one syndicate manager in London. 'I haven't seen anything like
it since 1987 - and this is probably worse than that.'
The overhang of paper in the Eurobond market has been made worse by the
large volume of new bond issues in the US recently. With underwriters still
holding many of these bonds, the international market has suffered a
knock-on effect, further damaging market sentiment.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japan groups to reduce reliance
on market growth
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA Electric and Mitsubishi Materials, two of Japan's largest
manufacturing companies, yesterday signalled that the economic downturn may
force manufacturers to revise radically corporate plans based on the
assumption of high rates of economic growth.
In a marked shift away from reliance on market growth to lift sales, both
companies plan to cut costs to improve flagging profitability because they
believe the downturn will herald a period of much slower than forecast
growth in Japan.
Matsushita is next month expected to unveil a radically revised three-year
plan which focuses on achieving higher profitability, in spite of assuming
close to zero growth in demand for consumer electronics.
The plan is likely to include staff cuts at the company's Osaka headquarters
and sharp reductions in graduate recruitment.
Mitsubishi Materials, the metals, cement and mining combine, has cut its
targets for sales, profit and investment over the next five years which were
drawn up only last year.
The company said it had reduced its 1995 target for sales by 20 per cent to
Y1,000bn (Dollars 8.33bn), pre-tax profits by 30 per cent to Y43bn and
capital investment by 10 per cent because it now expects economic growth to
remain at between 2.5 per cent and 3 per cent.
A further review of long-term targets will be launched early next year.
The extent of the economic downturn's impact on traditional manufacturing
companies was underlined by announcements that NKK and Mitsubishi Steel plan
wide-ranging restructuring.
Mitsubishi Steel said it made a net loss of Y900m for the half-year ended in
September after initially forecasting a profit of Y1.1bn.
NKK is expected to finalise a restructuring package for its troubled steel
division in December.
Meanwhile, Nippon Sheet Glass, Japan's second-largest sheet glass maker,
reported a 42 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y3.5bn for the half-year
to September.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cost-cutting limits decline in
Gold Fields' profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUCCESSFUL containment of production costs helped the gold mines in the
Gold Fields group limit the fall in operating profits to only 1 per cent
during the September quarter, despite a weaker gold price and increased
wages.
A particularly good performance at the Kloof mine helped lift group gold
production by nearly 800kg to 31,375kg, from 30,756kg in the June quarter.
This helped offset the lower average gold price, which fell to R30,865
(Dollars 10,956) per kg from R31,086 per kg three months earlier.
Unit costs per kg of gold produced were only 1 per cent higher at R21,558
per kg, compared with R21,346 per kg in the June quarter, as annual wage
increases offset the higher production.
Although operating profits were only 1 per cent lower at R293.3m from R299m
three months before, net profits fell to R226.7m from R286.7m, owing to a
large drop in sundry revenue and a higher tax charge caused by season-ally
lower capital expen-diture.
The Kloof mine, comprising the Kloof and Leeudoorn divisions, merged with
the Libanon division on July 1.
The newly-merged operation earned net profits of R115.3m, compared with
combined profits of R96.3m from the three mines in the June quarter.
The Kloof division reported a big increase in grade to 15.5 grams per tonne
from 13.7 grams three months earlier, and a rise in production to 8,368kg
from 7,375kg. This made the mine the lowest-cost producer in the South
African industry.
The Leeudoorn division made its first ever net profits - R8.8m against
losses of R2.9m - while the Libanon division incurred R9.3m operating
losses, which its managers said were largely due to a fire. They were
working towards making a profit in the current quarter.
Driefontein Consolidated, the group's largest mine, had a modest quarter,
with production shortfalls because of a fire in its West mine and lower
sundry revenue, pushing net profits down to R115.7m from R161.5m in the June
quarter
Deelkraal results suffered from a poorer grade ore, while Doornfontein,
despite achieving its production target of 110,000kg per month, made losses
of R17m.
Mr Alan Munro, executive director, said a decision on Deelkraal's future -
closure being a possibility - would be taken within 'days and weeks, not
weeks and months'.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Creating a worldwide yen for
Japanese beer - Emiko Terazono examines brewers' plans for expansion into
foreign markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE brewers are trying to cultivate overseas drinkers' taste for their
beers by stressing they, rather than western brands, go best with sushi and
sukiyaki.
Although the high yen, expensive transport costs and low profit margins have
curbed Japanese brewers' overseas expansion, stagnation in domestic sales
due to market saturation is forcing the companies to turn to international
expansion.
Higher overseas demand for Japanese beer, due to the increasing popularity
of Japanese cuisine and rising numbers of Japanese expatriates, has also
motivated Japanese brewers to look abroad for markets.
Kirin Brewery, the world's fourth biggest and Japan's largest brewer,
recently announced a licensing agreement with Charles Wells brewery of
Bedford, England. Wells will start producing Kirin's lager next year.
Kirin has had a licensing deal with Molson, the Canadian brewer, since 1987,
as well as a contract with the Hong Kong arm of Philippine brewer San
Miguel.
Kirin has opted for overseas production rather than exports. It believes
that freshness is the most important factor for beers, adding that tariff
barriers can be avoided through overseas production.
Asahi Breweries, which bought 20 per cent of Foster's of Australia in 1990,
says it is looking for further overseas expansion through the Foster's
international network. It also wants a further brewing stake in Australia as
soon as regulatory limits are lifted there.
Sapporo Breweries was the first Japanese brewer to sell its beer overseas -
in the 1940s. It does not think overseas production is warranted because of
the small volume of sales abroad.
For the big four brewers, Kirin, Asahi, Sapporo and Suntory, the US is their
largest overseas market, consuming over 70 per cent of foreign sales. They
add that Asian markets have the greatest potential, since beer is a
relatively new drink and Japanese brands are popular.
The brewers' expansion abroad comes as other Japanese companies are
retreating from international markets. The brewers, like most Japanese
corporations, are victims of the stock market crash, and face a squeeze in
cash-flow owing to losses on stock holdings and redemptions for
equity-linked financing from the late 1980s.
The beer companies admit they are cautious about rapid overseas expansion,
and their foreign sales are still only about 1 per cent of turnover.
But the companies believe the industry, set up in the 1860s with the help of
German, Dutch and American brewers, has become a world leader in brewing
technology.
They also say the taste of Japanese beer is gaining international acceptance
as a compromise between overly light American beers and heavy European
beers.
Asahi's 'dry' beer, with its sharper taste and higher alcohol content, has
been successful abroad, particularly in North America.
Sapporo claims it has brought about a change in the way brewers market draft
beer by packaging its unpasteurised brew using a ceramic filtration method.
Since Sapporo's introduction of packaged draft beer in the US in 1979, US
manufacturers have created their own versions.
Kirin's overseas sales of Ichiban Shibori - meaning first pressing of the
malt - is rising in tandem with domestic popularity. Kirin plans to start
overseas production of the beer, marketed as Kirin Ichiban in the US and
Europe, next year.
Japanese brewers have competed in the domestic markets through a wider range
of new brews, from dry beer to beer drunk on the rocks. Although overseas
sales will be focused on a smaller number of brands, more innovative brands
are likely to be launched on overseas markets.
Mr Tetsuya Fujiwara, of Kirin, says: 'There is a high overseas demand for
products which become popular in Japan.'
Kirin plans to start licensed production of Kirin Ichiban in the US next
year, and also hopes to do the same in Europe in the near future.
The question is: will the Japanese brewers follow their counterparts in the
electronic and automobile industries, and become the Toyotas and Matsushitas
of the global beer market? 'That's probably unlikely,' says Kirin's Mr
Fujiwara. 'The taste of beer is very cultural and personal, not like
electronic goods or cars.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Murdoch to sell first large US
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Rupert Murdoch has agreed to sell his first large venture in the US, the
San Antonio Express-News group, to the Hearst Corporation in a deal worth
Dollars 185m in cash.
The agreement is likely to result in closure for Hearst's existing title,
the San Antonio Light, the Texas afternoon paper which the company has owned
since the 1920s.
Mr Murdoch, chairman and chief executive of News Corp, said yesterday he had
mixed feelings about the sale.
'As publishers of newspapers around the world, we recognise the economic
realities of competitive newspaper markets in the US and that this
transaction will strengthen both News Corporation and Hearst,' Mr Murdoch
said.
Hearst said yesterday it would try to find a buyer for the Light but made
clear that if none was found the paper, which has a circulation of 148,591
daily and 221,186 on Sunday, would close. The Express-News, bought by Mr
Murdoch in 1973, has a daily circulation of 188,797 with 284,728 on Sunday.
Mr Murdoch seems to have driven a hard bargain. All the Express-News staff
will keep their jobs. If the Light closes, the staff will get severance pay.
He said the Express-News staff had waged a long and victorious contest in
the San Antonio market 'and no agreement would have been possible without a
guarantee that they would all be offered continued employment'.
The deal raises questions over how long Mr Murdoch will keep the Boston
Herald, his last directly-owned newspaper in the US and also a paper that
faces competition from the Boston Globe.

advance

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ADVANCED Micro Devices, the US semiconductor manufacturer, yesterday
reported strong third-quarter sales boosted by demand for microprocessors
used in personal computers.
The company, which saw profits advance during the quarter, also revealed a
sharp increase in orders during the normally slow summer season.
'We believe AMD is now the world's largest producer of 386 microprocessors,'
said Mr W. J. Sanders III, AMD chairman and chief executive.
Net income for the quarter was Dollars 49.1m before payment of dividends on
preferred stock, compared with Dollars 17.1m last time. Revenues rose 23 per
cent to Dollars 356.7m from Dollars 289.4m in the same period last year.
After the preferred stock dividend, quarterly net income was 51 cents per
common share, up from 16 cents.
Strong third-quarter orders portend accelerating growth in the fourth
quarter, Mr Sanders said. 'We expect Am386 microprocessor unit sales volumes
will remain at record levels in the current quarter,' he added.
AMD's 386 success follows bitter legal disputes with Intel, the original
maker of 386 microprocessors. Although AMD claims to have overtaken Intel in
386 sales, the market is switching to the new 486 microprocessors of which
Intel is the dominant supplier.
For the first nine months the company reported revenues of Dollars 1.1bn, an
increase of 29 per cent, with net income of Dollars 175.4m before preferred
dividends, or Dollars 1.84 after dividend payments. For the same period last
year sales were Dollars 860.5m and net income was Dollars 30.8m.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Shares in Citicorp slide after
president resigns
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE shares of Citicorp yesterday became the target of very heavy trading on
Wall Street as the mystery deepened over the surprise resignation of Mr
Richard Braddock, the Citicorp president who was the closest collaborator of
Mr John Reed, the bank's embattled chairman.
Yesterday morning, Citicorp's stock opened Dollars 1 lower, a drop of 6.5
per cent, before recovering slightly to close at Dollars 14 3/4 , a decline
of Dollars  3/4 . Trading volume was an exceptionally high 2.6m shares.
Both insiders at Citicorp and Wall Street analysts said yesterday they
believed Mr Braddock had been ousted by Mr Reed, his long-time friend.
Mr John Morris, Citicorp's spokesman, said: 'The bank's statement states
that Mr Braddock chose to resign.'
The news of Mr Braddock's departure came at an especially poor time for
Citicorp since the bank this week had started to market a Dollars 650m offer
of preferred stock. The stock issue is part of the bank's efforts to boost
its below-average capital ratio, at the behest of government bank
regulators.
Wall Street analysts were also disappointed at the announcement by Citicorp
that its third-quarter earnings would be less than 13 cents, or about half
the level most analysts say they had been led to expect.
The bank said yesterday that since Mr Braddock's job will not be filled, his
responsibilities would be divided by the other five top Citicorp managers.
They are Mr Reed, Mr Onno Ruding, the former Dutch politician named as a
vice-chairman last January, Mr William Rhodes and Mr Paul Collins, both
Citicorp veterans, and Mr Pei-yuan Chia, head of consumer operations.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: US insurer returns to its
Chinese roots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN International Group (AIG), the US insurance group, has been granted
the first licence to sell insurance in China, initially in Shanghai.
For AIG, the licence represents a return to its roots. The company was
founded in Shanghai in 1919 by Mr C. V. Starr, an American entrepreneur, but
was forced to quit the country when the communists took over in 1949.
The licensing of AIG further illustrates the growing deregulation of China's
financial services markets.
China plans to admit foreign stockbrokers to conduct business on its two
stock exchanges, and foreign banks are also expected to be permitted to
conduct business in the future.
Mr M. R. Greenberg, AIG chairman, who is visiting Shanghai, said his
company's roots were in Asia. 'We will focus on building our staff and
developing products tailored to the needs of this market.'
AIG will be permitted to sell life insurance to individual Chinese and
foreign nationals. It will also be able to sell property and casualty
insurance to joint venture companies and other foreign businesses in
Shanghai.
Before the communist takeover, Shanghai - often described as the Paris of
the East - was China's industrial and financial centre.
It has lagged behind since China embarked on its 'open door' policy 13 years
ago, but recently has moved to the front of policymakers' interests and is
now catching up rapidly with more advanced areas in the south.
Mr Greenberg said he believed AIG's presence would help attract investment
for Shanghai's development.
AIG has a well-established presence in the Far East - both in life
insurance, via American International Assurance, which claims to be the
region's largest life operation, and in the property-casualty sector. The
area is, however, attracting interest from other big US insurers - and
several have established life insurance operations in the region.

CASCADES, an international packaging group controlled by the Lemaire
brothers of Montreal, plans to raise CDollars 125m to CDollars 150m
(USDollars 120m) in equity for its new Cascades Paperboard International
subsidiary.
The shares will be offered in Europe as well as North America, and the new
funds will be used to reduce debt and develop the subsidiary.
Cascades, the Lemaires' holding company, acquired 100 per cent of the old
Paperboard Industries from a banking syndicate. It has now put all its
packaging products operations in North America and Europe into the new unit
which will be 60 per cent owned by the holding company after the equity
issue.
Cascades Paperboard, which will be profitable, has annual sales of about
CDollars 1bn.
The new issue is being underwritten by the group headed by Gordon and RBC
Dominion Securities, both of Toronto.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GTE and Bell Canada, respectively the biggest local telephone companies in
the US and Canada, are to co-operate in selling their billing and other
information services to telephone utilities in other countries.
The two groups see lucrative opportunities in improving the billing systems
of recently-privatised telephone companies whose customers have up to now
received only rudimentary accounts with little information on individual
calls.
Mr Don Hayes, president of GTE Data Services, a subsidiary, said yesterday
that government-owned utilities 'haven't been motivated to be responsive to
the customer'.
GTE Data Services already has contracts in the Netherlands, Denmark and
Puerto Rico. Mr Hayes said the company was also in discussions with British
Telecom, an Italian phone company, and the Mexican telephone utility.
Bell, a subsidiary of BCE Inc of Montreal, has been looking for ways to
forge links with foreign telecommunications companies as the domestic market
becomes more competitive.
Mr Hayes said GTE and Bell Canada saw 'a very nice fit' between their areas
of expertise. GTE, which also provides information processing services to
the US health care and insurance industries, has concentrated on billing,
while Bell's strength is in order entry systems and in the recording and
execution of service changes required by individual customers, known as
'provisioning'.
Bell said the addition of the GTE system would allow it to tailor telephone
bills not only to individual phone numbers, as is now the case, but also to
itemise spending according to a business user's branches, geographical
region or service.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD, the US carmaker, said yesterday that it had decided to drop the name
Sierra for its crucial large family car range in Europe.
The replacement, which is to be launched early next year at the Geneva motor
show, will be named Mondeo.
The new range is vital to the immediate recovery prospects for Ford's
European operations, which have plunged back into loss after making a modest
profit in the first six months this year.
The Mondeo will replace the Sierra in Europe and the Ford Tempo/Mercury
Topaz in the US.
It marks a big gamble for Ford, which for the first time has developed in
Europe a common model for the European and North American markets.
Mr Allan Gilmour, president of the Ford automotive group, said the Mondeo
range of large family cars would include saloon, hatchback and estate
variants and would be produced in both Europe - at the Genk, Belgium plant -
and in North America.
Ford said yesterday that it had opened a components office in Beijing as
part of its drive to source more parts from lower-cost countries.

THE MARKET for trucks and buses continues to deteriorate and an improvement
later this year is out of the question, Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, chairman of
Renault Vehicules Industriels (RVI), said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Paris.
'We can expect a result for 1992 that is below the extrapolations that we
were able to make based on the first half,' Mr Capron said.
RVI, 55 per cent owned by French state-owned vehicle maker Renault and 45
per cent by Volvo of Sweden, reported a consolidated pre-tax loss of FFr437m
(Dollars 91.42m) for the first six months. In the first six months of 1991,
RVI lost FFr128m.
Last month, Mr Marc Randon, RVI's secretary-general, said the company would
probably make a loss for the whole year after reporting a net profit of
FFr23m in 1991.
Volvo Personvagnar AB, the passenger vehicle producer in the Swedish AB
Volvo group, said sales of new cars in the US market fell 15 per cent in
September to 2,903 units, from 3,429 units in the same month a year earlier.
Volvo noted the contraction in the US car market had been 4 per cent in the
month. Mr Klas Magnusson, Volvo spokesman, said better sales could be
expected in October. In the first nine months of the year, Volvo's US sales
have declined 5.24 per cent, to 51,567 units.

in west European car sales
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING western carmakers warned yesterday that west European new car sales
would fall in 1993 for the second successive year.
German and French manufacturers are also moving quickly to raise prices in
the Italian market in the wake of the heavy devaluation of the lira, despite
concern over weakening demand. Volkswagen of Germany has raised its prices
by around 5.5 per cent in Italy, while Renault is raising its by about 4 per
cent.
French and German carmakers appear to be delaying any immediate price
increases in the UK despite the heavy fall in the value of the pound.
With official car prices in the UK already heavily discounted, real price
rises would be difficult to implement.
Mr Jacques Calvet, chairman of PSA Peugeot Citroen, said yesterday that
European exports would be complicated by the 'combination of unstable EC
exchange rates, a weak dollar and the deliberately undervalued yen. As a
result, unemployment is on the rise.'
Political and economic factors were generating greater gloom in Europe.
'Looming elections, triumphant monetarism, structural problems in the UK and
the determination to correct certain economic and financial imbalances in
Spain and Italy are causing consumer spending and investment either to
stagnate or decline,' Mr Calvet said.
Mr Louis Hughes, president of General Motors Europe, forecast that west
European new car sales would drop to 13.3m this year from 13.43m in 1991 and
would be 'clearly under 13m' in 1993 'if present consumer uncertainty in
some markets continues'.
Mr Allan Gilmour, president of Ford's automotive operations, warned that
'recent currency and interest rate fluctuations throughout Europe have
created uncertainty and reduced consumer confidence.'

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LARGE shareholders in Banque Bruxelles Lambert (BBL) have turned down a 6.72
per cent stake in the Belgian bank, clearing the way for Internationale
Nederlanden Groep (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance company, to buy the
shares and proceed to a full bid for BBL.
ING, which already owns 10 per cent of BBL, announced last month it planned
to buy the stake from Unipar and SBH Investments of Italy, with a view to
making a bid. But the stake first had to be offered to other members of a
shareholder syndicate, headed by Groupe Bruxelles Lambert (GBL), the Belgian
holding company which owns 13 per cent of BBL.
Mr Jacques Thierry, BBL's chairman, announced on Monday night that the
syndicate members had not exercised their option to buy the shares. ING will
now audit of BBL's accounts before deciding whether to launch its
BFr3,600-a-share bid, which values the bank at BFr63.6bn (Dollars 2.18bn).
Since the possibility of a bid was announced, GBL - which indirectly
controls a further 11 per cent of BBL - has been forthright in its
opposition to the price and the bidder. Comte Jean-Pierre de Launoit, GBL's
deputy chairman and a BBL director, said 10 days ago that the price was
insufficient.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japan's car industry 'at
crossroads' - The opening of the Paris motor show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE motor industry 'may now be at a structural crossroads,' Mr
Yoshifumi Tsuji, president of Nissan, the second largest Japanese carmaker,
warned yesterday.
'The global motor industry is facing a business climate of unprecedented
severity,' he said. Amid worldwide recession, vehicle demand had dropped in
all three of the world's major markets - Europe, the US and Japan.
Nissan, which is this year expecting its first loss since 1946 and which is
omitting its interim dividend, was being hit by falling sales in both
domestic and foreign markets, which had 'been worse than anyone projected,'
said Mr Tsuji.
The Nissan president said the company was operating at less than 80 per cent
of capacity in Japan, and three assembly lines had been reduced to single
shift working. Mr Tsuji said Nissan was seeking to reduce its Japanese
workforce by around 4,000 in the three years from 1992 to 1994 from 56,000
to 52,000.
The company was planning to cut 8,500 jobs in Japan - 6,500 direct workers
and 2,000 indirect and salaried jobs as a result of cost-cutting. However,
around 4,500 new jobs would be added to compensate for reductions in working
hours and to account for the greater complexity of making more up-market
models.
Working hours are to be cut from 2,100 hours a year at present (including
overtime) to 1,900 hours a year by the end of 1994. This will reduce
Japanese working hours to the present level of Nissan's European car
assembly plant at Sunderland, north-east England, where assembly-line
workers currently average around 1,900 hours a year, including 100 hours
overtime.
In Japan, Nissan has already cut the level of temporary workers to around 10
per cent of the direct labour force from the earlier industry average of 20
to 25 per cent. This will be cut further to around 5 per cent by the end of
1994.
Mr Tsuji warned that there was 'little expectation that the market will
recover quickly in the immediate future.' The company was facing 'a very
difficult time with respect to profitability.'
It was taking 'urgent steps' to improve its profit structure. Nissan is
undertaking a drastic review of its product plans in order to cut the number
of model variants and types of components offered.
It plans to promote 'vigorously' the greater use of common parts among
different car models.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: OMV seeks partner to take 20%
stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OMV, the Austrian oil group, is to seek a foreign partner to take a 20 per
cent stake in the company in a further step in its privatisation.
The Austrian government was reported earlier this year to be considering a
merger between OMV and the Verbund utility. But Mr Wolfgang Ruttenstorfer,
OMV's chief financial officer, said yesterday it had become 'clear a merger
was not realistic'.
Instead, Austrian Industries, the state holding company, is to reduce the 72
per cent stake it has held in OMV since initial privatisation in 1987 to 30
per cent, and OMV will seek a foreign partner to take a 20 per cent stake.
The proportion of shares in the public domain will be increased from 28 to
50 per cent through a private or public share placement.
OMV is Austria's largest quoted industrial company, with a market
capitalisation of Sch24bn (Dollars 2.43bn).
Mr Ruttenstorfer said plans were at an early stage, but OMV was selecting an
investment house to handle the proposed changes and hoped to start talking
to potential partners by the end of the year.
The changes in the ownership structure should be completed in 1993 or early
1994.
He said OMV was seeking a partner which was a crude producer, in order to to
secure access to greater oil supplies, and which would help OMV to implement
its corporate strategy.
That strategy includes increasing oil reserves through refocusing and higher
spending on exploration and production activities, and strengthening OMV's
position as an integrated energy company in central and eastern Europe.
The company already has motor fuel marketing operations in the former
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Slovenia, and is seeking a stake in a refinery
in the Czech republic.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Share slide reduces Trinity flotation price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRINITY HOLDINGS is to come to the market at 120p, valuing the maker of
chassis for Dennis buses, fire engines and refuse collection vehicles at
about Pounds 61.7m.
The pricing decision was taken during 'traumatic' Monday night talks that
followed the plunge in the FT-SE 100 Index and turmoil in the foreign
exchange markets, according to Mr Geoff Hollyhead, chairman.
As late as last week, the company had hoped the placing and intermediaries
offer would value Trinity at about Pounds 80m.
At 120p, Trinity is valued at the equivalent of 11.3 times forecast earnings
per share for a pro forma year ending January 1993.
The shares yield 6 per cent at this price on the same basis.
The flotation will raise about Pounds 29m net of expenses. Some Pounds 14m
will repay the debt that financed the 1989 management buy-out from the
conglomerate, Hestair. It will also reduce working capital and redeem the
preference shares, leaving Trinity virtually debt free.
Directors, other shareholders - like Citicorp and Bankers Trust - and
employees will receive another Pounds 14m.
The directors and original shareholders now hold 43 per cent of the new
equity. The founding shareholders have agreed to hold their shares for at
least a year and the directors will not sell for 18 months.
Private investors will be free to apply for 6.4m of the 25.6m new shares by
applying to financial intermediaries. Applications must be in by noon on
October 14.
Mr Hollyhead describes Trinity as a specialist niche engineer of vehicles.
While market growth has been slow or non-existent in the UK, Trinity's share
of those markets has grown rapidly.
Its share of the bus market, for example, has grown from 10 per cent in 1982
to 19 per cent in 1990, a year after buy-out and to 50.4 per cent in 1992.
Trinity's share of the refuse collection vehicle market grew from 15 per
cent in 1979 to 45 per cent in 1991. Fire trucks remained a static market,
with Dennis taking about 40 per cent of the market.
COMMENT
On the face of it Trinity looks like that rare beast, a management buy-out
that is not only cash generative but has growth potential as well. Certainly
after three years of notable growth in dull markets for buses, coaches,
refuse collection vehicles and fire engines, its past performance is not in
question. Beyond the end of 1992, the growth is more in question. Granted a
race to develop market dominance in the UK refuse collection market has
prevented the company from looking to Europe. That market is now beckoning,
indeed more so after sterling's devaluation. Equally eastern Europe through
a soon-to-be-signed contract in Poland has great potential. But it is less
obvious that next year will see a reversal of the recent UK trend of
under-replacement of UK bus stock which Trinity hopes will fuel further
growth in the UK. For this year, however, operating profits of Pounds 8.5m
giving earnings of 10.6p means 120p is a relatively undemanding flotation
price.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Harmony pressed to make board changes as
losses soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REBEL shareholders at Harmony Leisure yesterday repeated their call for
board changes after the USM-quoted restaurants group announced a 70 per cent
increase in pre-tax losses.
In the year to March 29 losses reached Pounds 3.68m compared with a 1990-91
deficit of Pounds 2.17m.
Turnover fell from Pounds 9.63m to Pounds 6.45m as the directors admitted
that 'trading conditions were the worst the company has ever encountered'.
The pre-tax result was struck after exceptional charges of Pounds 2.66m
(Pounds 1.13m) to cover restructuring and disposals, including an estimated
Pounds 1.99m reduction in the value of its fixed assets.
Losses per share increased to 13.83p (8.07p). No dividend has been paid
since the year ended March, 1989.
The dissident shareholders have requisitioned an extraordinary meeting and
claim more than 30 per cent of the shareholders have backed their moves to
replace the executive directors.
Rebel leader Mr Simon Lynch, a former managing director of the HH Finch pub
group, yesterday described the latest losses as 'unbelievable'. 'I don't see
how the board will be able to continue.'
Mr Stanley Lever, Harmony managing director, said the company would try to
cut costs and pledged to take 'whatever steps are appropriate to de-gear.
'We are determined Harmony will be well positioned to take advantage of any
improvement in the economy'.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Buying costs clip Manchester United 6% to
Pounds 5.06m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPENDING on players reduced pre-tax profit at Manchester United, the Premier
League football club, by 6 per cent in its first full year as a quoted
company.
Although profit before transfer fees went up by 24 per cent to Pounds 7.68m
(Pounds 6.18m), net spending of Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 801,000) on players -
including defender Paul Parker and goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel - cut the
pre-tax outcome to Pounds 5.06m (Pounds 5.38m).
To draw attention to the fact that the players represent an investment,
rather than simply a drain on profits, United said it had commissioned an
independent valuation by Touche Ross, the accountants, which estimated that
the squad was worth Pounds 24m. Not that this figure was being put on the
balance sheet, said Mr Martin Edwards, chief executive and holder of 28 per
cent of the shares.
Mr Robin Launders, finance director, suggested that the share price, which
rose from 282p to 289p yesterday (still 96p below the flotation price), was
discounting net spending of at least Pounds 2m on players this year. So far
the Pounds 1m paid out for striker Dion Dublin (who has since broken his
leg) has been balanced by disposals.
With a further Pounds 250,000 added to the transfer reserve, it could
support spending of Pounds 3.35m on players.
Turnover in the year to July 31 rose 13 per cent to Pounds 20.1m thanks to
higher attendances - the average gate for league games at Old Trafford was
45,000 - and higher prices. Gate receipts rose to Pounds 11.1m (Pounds
9.2m).
Income from sponsorship, catering and the club shop rose by between 9 and 14
per cent.
The only decline came in television revenue, from Pounds 2.34m to Pounds
1.84m.
Mr Edwards said that the club had totted up 110 hours of television the
previous year, when it won the European Cup Winners Cup. This year the
Premier League deal with BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster, would bring in
about Pounds 1.8m. Other television income might add another Pounds 1m.
Operating profit advanced by 8 per cent to Pounds 6.26m (Pounds 5.79m).
Interest income rose to Pounds 1.42m (Pounds 385,000) and the amount of cash
held increased to Pounds 14.8m (Pounds 14.1m). This was after capital
spending of nearly Pounds 4m, including the first Pounds 2m of an estimated
Pounds 10m on the new Stretford End stand.
Mr Launders said that this season building work has reduced capacity from
47,000 to less than 34,000. However, price rises and the reduction in the
number of cheaper terrace tickets had raised the average match revenue per
person from Pounds 9 to Pounds 13.10. Next season the capacity would rise
again to 43,000.
A final dividend of 12p makes a total of 18p, compared with 17.4p forecast
at flotation. Earnings per share improved from 17.8p to 27.6p after the
transfer fund appropriation, or to 29.7p, compared with 37p, before it.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Hunter Saphir shares fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNTER SAPHIR shares fell 8p to 28p, yesterday following a trading statement
given in a circular containing details of the disposal of Emil Tissot Foods
to Cavaghan &amp; Gray.
The chairman said that since mid-July, after an excellent first quarter, the
fresh produce business had been adversely affected by the general price
deflation. In the last three years profits have fallen from Pounds 6.05m to
Pounds 2.51m for the year to the end of February 1992.
As the major part of the business was commission based, the company had
incurred no contractual losses. The company had continued to gain market
share and to increase volumes but overall commission income had declined.
British Pepper and Spice had maintained its recovery, with revenues up by
more than 20 per cent, but it was not yet back into profit. Euroma, the
Dutch subsidiary, continued to grow but margins were under pressure.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Loss and dividend cut at Ben Bailey
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
An erosion of margins and an increased write down in value of land stock
pushed Ben Bailey Construction into a loss of Pounds 443,000 in the year
ended June 30 1992.
The final dividend is halved to 0.25p; that gives 0.55p for the year,
against 0.8p last time when the pre-tax profit was Pounds 317,000. Losses
per share came to 2.98p (earnings 2.16p).
The company said that in the second half there had been a slow but steady
deterioration in the willingness of people to buy new homes without heavy
incentives and price reductions.
In the face of falling margins maintaining volumes became paramount, and 279
(247) units were sold at an average of Pounds 50,000 (Pounds 51,000) to
produce turnover of Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 16.5m). But gross profit declined
to Pounds 1.87m (Pounds 3.36m).
Administration expenses were cut as was interest payable. Stock write down
was Pounds 467,000 (Pounds 146,000).

S&amp;U, the Birmingham-based consumer credit house and hosiery maker, increased
its pre-tax profit by 24 per cent in the half year ended July 31 1992 mainly
through tight cost control.
Turnover rose only 6 per cent, from Pounds 23.5m to Pounds 24.9m, and the
profit came to Pounds 2.09m (Pounds 1.69m). Adjusting for a scrip issue,
earnings worked through at 12.42p (9.85p) and the interim dividend is

Net asset value of North American Gas Investment Trust was 55.5p at July 31,
20 per cent down on the 69.4p of a year earlier.
However Mr Jack Birks, chairman, said the outlook for the current year was

There was a pre-tax profit of Pounds 70,000 for the year to the end of July,

SUNSET + VINE, the television programme production company, reported pre-tax
profits for the year to the end of June down slightly at Pounds 687,000,
against Pounds 702,000.
The figure was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 54,000 this time
but included a lower contribution from interest receivable of Pounds 107,000
(Pounds 203,000).
Mr Colin Frewin, chief executive, said that the company was continuing to
develop drama and light entertainment and a range of sports programmes.
In addition, Sunrise Post Productions made a significant contribution to the
figures.
He added that he did not hesitate in re-affirming his belief that the
company would continue to grow during the recession.
Turnover was Pounds 4.51m (Pounds 4.02m). Earnings per share were unchanged
at 8.8p and the directors are proposing a same again final dividend of 2p
for a maintained total of 3.5p.
Mr Frewin said the company had been commissioned to produce two further
series of the Gillette World Sport Special, through to the end of 1994, as
well as a 13-part Gillette World Cup Special.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Simpsons shows flat second half
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMPSONS of Cornhill, owner of the famous City chop house, yesterday
announced a small profit following a year marked by a bitter struggle for
control of the company.
The Nottingham-based group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 80,000 in the 53
weeks to July 4.
Hopes of better results were undermined by flat demand in the second half
following interim profits of Pounds 88,000 in the six months to December 31.
Mr Paul Reece, managing director, said the profit on a turnover of Pounds
1.53m would undermine moves by a group of dissident shareholders to unseat
the board.
The dissidents - led by Mr Robert Klapp, former chairman of Select
Appointments - feared the company had abandoned its strategy of opening
themed chop house restaurants. They failed, however, to get two directors
elected at an extraordinary meeting in August.
Mr Klapp, who claims the backing of more than 30 per cent of the
shareholders, is now seeking another EGM to oust the existing management
team.
Simpsons, which came to the USM in August 1991, plans to publish its
accounts later this week and Mr Reece predicted they would confound rebel
claims that the opening this year of two London bistros - Dell'Ugo and Palio
 -had incurred large losses. 'We hope the accounts will defuse the rebel
moves,' he added.
As regards a dividend, the directors have decided to conserve cash resources
this time but will consider a payment in the current year.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson on course with recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN &amp; JACKSON, the discount retailer which operates the Poundstretcher
chain of stores and has recently undergone a radical reorganisation,
yesterday announced interim results which, as expected, showed pre-tax
losses for the nine and six month periods to June 30.
But it was emphasised the group was on course with its recovery programme.
In the first half of 1992 the group ran up a pre-tax loss of Pounds 9.73m,
including a Pounds 643,000 exceptional charge to cover the disposal of A&amp;G
Imports. That compared to a deficit of Pounds 4.29m in the corresponding
period, on turnover which fell by 15.5 per cent to Pounds 67.4m (Pounds
79.9m).
On a fully diluted basis the loss per share was 3.3p for six months (1.3p).
The group was reverting to a December 31 financial year, so the current
accounts would cover 15 months. It also published results for the nine
months to June 30. These showed a pre-tax loss, after the exceptional item,
of Pounds 2.14m or 0.6p a share fully diluted, on turnover of Pounds 142m.
Mr Ian Gray, the recently appointed chief executive who leads a new
management team brought in following a revolt by institutional shareholders
last year, said trading conditions in the first half were difficult and
sales at Poundstretcher, which accounted for about 80 per cent of turnover,
were down by about 5 per cent over 1991.
In addition, the group was operating for most of the period under severe
cash constraints until the proceeds of its Pounds 15.6m share placement and
open offer were received in late June. This restricted purchasing which had
an adverse effect on both sales volume and gross margins.
Nevertheless, the group managed to improve its performance on a
quarter-by-quarter basis, reducing pre-tax losses to Pounds 3.89m in the
three months to June 30 compared to Pounds 5.85m in the previous quarter,
and Pounds 7.6m in the final three months of 1991. Mr Gray said current
trading was 'in line with expectations'.
COMMENT
Analysing Brown &amp; Jackson's results is complicated by its decision to return
to an end-December financial year, a move justified because of the extremely
seasonal nature of the business - Poundstretcher's 230 shops traditionally
incur losses in all but the last quarter of the year. With the
recapitalisation only completed in June, the first half results mark a
reasonable start on the recovery road. Ian Gray, a retail specialist from
Thorn EMI's rental division before being brought in to help rescue B&amp;J in
February, has wasted no time in getting to grips with the problems. Two
former subsidiaries have gone, the other non-Poundstretcher interests are
under review, and the Poundstretcher shops are being updated and refitted.
Stocks have been reduced and firmer mangement and cost controls introduced.
With luck, and a good Christmas, the group should break-even this year and
be back in the black in 1993.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Arts: A racial crackerjack - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you would like to see a short crackerjack of a play at one of the most
modern theatres in London, go to the Albany Empire in Deptford SE8 where
there is an explosive production of Dutchman by Leroi James.
The piece was first performed in 1964 when racial tension in the US was at
its public height. Dutchman contains the very best of American drama: it is
sharp, cerebral, full of subtle changes of pace and ultimately violent.
Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train will inevitably come to mind. So, in a more
roundabout way, will Strindberg's Miss Julie, especially if you can imagine
Miss Julie being played by a black, as once happened in South Africa.
Dutchman is about race, sex, class and language - the body language is quite
as important as the spoken. A white woman enters a train in New York to join
a black middle-class male. They have looked at each other before through the
train window when she was still on the platform. He, in his suit and tie, is
reading; she, with obvious symbolism, is eating an apple. She teases him,
flaunts her sexuality, appears genuinely fond of him, but also accuses
upwardly mobile, educated blacks of being Uncle Toms in a white society.
He hits back. The play ends with a fatal stabbing - I shall not say which
way round. In the meantime, without anything much happening, we have been
through all the racial, sexual and linguistic nuances that you can expect to
see on a stage. In the background, but not obtrusive, there is the continual
noise of the train. The stage seems to sway slightly, as trains do.
The train is a metaphor for an unfinished journey where strangers meet. Here
are Americans talking to each other about race, sex and society, while also
concealing thoughts, in a way that you will not find in a British writer.
The other American play showing in London which has some of the same
subtleties is John Guare's Six Degrees of Separation. Dutchman, written much
earlier, is tighter and a minor masterpiece.
The man, who in his youth saw himself as a black Baudelaire, is played by
Mark Vidol, the white woman by Nicola Winterson. She dominates the first
half, but note also her physical reactions of subjection, longing, envy and
rage when Vidol talks back in the second. She is just as good when silent.
I think that it is a mistake that there is a killing at the end. It raises
questions that cannot be answered about motivation and whether the murder
was premeditated. Far better if the couple simply walked away from each
other, as passengers do at the end of a train journey. But no doubt even the
best playwrights assume that there must be a dramatic climax.
If it has not been done before, Dutchman, which lasts for little more than
an hour, would make a magnificent piece of television. Here on stage it is
flawlessly directed by dein jones-ere, as he insists on calling himself in
small letters. The Albany Empire belies its name. It is not one of those old
Edwardian houses, but a remarkably pleasant modern hi-tech place opened by
the Prince of Wales in 1979. Sadly, very sadly, on the opening night on
Monday there were only 15 people in the audience. That did not deter the
performers who deserve a full house. The nearest obvious landmark is New
Cross underground station.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Arts: Maxwell Davies &amp; Muldowney - New Music
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Maxwell Davies took charge of the Royal Philharmonic on Monday in his
new role as the orchestra's associate conductor/composer, a position he
already holds with both the Scottish Chamber Orchestra and the BBC
Philharmonic. He has promised his Sixth Symphony to the RPO for performance
in 1996, their 50th anniversary. In the meantime he will conduct the
orchestra in concerts and recordings, though his forays into the mainstream
orchestral repertory remain unconvincing.
The programme combined Davies's own music with Sibelius - the tone poem
Tapiola and the Violin Concerto, with Tasmin Little as the excellent
soloist. Sibelius has been a potent influence on Davies's own music for the
best part of two decades, from the First Symphony onwards, and it was
fascinating to hear how, in Tapiola especially, he dealt with those elements
that bear directly on his own later style - the continuous skeins of
development, the saw-tooth waves of tension, the machine-like consistency of
the momentum - without ever quite welding them into a unity.
Davies ended the concert with An Orkney Wedding, with Sunrise, arguably
nowadays his most popular work, and conducted the first performance of a
second suite drawn from his evening-long score Caroline Mathilde, written
for the Danish Royal Ballet last year. The first suite of four movements
(already available on disc) drew upon the first act of the ballet; the new
one, lasting half an hour, contains seven numbers from Act 2 which chart the
inevitable drift towards disaster of the heroine, wife of King Christian VII
of Denmark, the execution of her lover, Struensee, and Caroline's own exile.
The music is skilful, effortlessly sustained; Davies's mingling of parody
and pastiche with his own style is now utterly instinctive. But it is also
far less pungent and memorable than it was: the music makes more
accommodations with its audience, softens its edges, undercuts its irony.
Even the final section of Caroline Mathilde, accompanying the queen's
farewell to her child and her departure, is soft-centred, not at all bleak.
The passacaglia that provides the second pas de deux for Caroline and
Struensee, built from arching string lines, is the core of the suite and its
strongest music, but even that power is diffused in the sections that follow
it.
* * * At the Barbican the London Symphony Orchestra's new season has already
included two significant premieres. The orchestra's first concert with
Michael Tilson Thomas contained Colin Matthews's Hidden Variables, an
orchestral expansion of an existing ensemble piece which pokes gentle and
sometimes not so gentle fun at the 57 varieties of minimalism, while last
Wednesday brought the first performance of Dominic Muldowney's Oboe
Concerto, commissioned by the LSO for its principal oboist Roy Carter.
This is the third concerto by Muldowney to appear in less than a year, but
it is far less intricate in construction than either the work for percussion
or that for violin. Muldowney calls it a 'Song-cycle for oboe and
orchestra', and the impression is of an intensely lyrical work, a succession
of deliciously suggestive inventions separated by brief recitatives. The
solo writing keeps the oboe in its highest register for much of the time,
while the accompanying textures are generally thin and crystalline; the
technical demands, wonderfully mastered by Carter, are formidable.
The songs contain passing references to jazz and popular-song styles, dips
into Debussyan impressionism and overripe Straussian romanticism (though the
near-quote of the Redemption motive from The Ring is surely accidental). The
single lack, perhaps inappropriate in an oboe concerto in any case, is of
any real muscularity, as if in stripping out all his complex apparatus of
rhythm and tempo Muldowney has jettisoned some of his more bracing aspects
too. A small cavil, though; the piece is a major addition to the oboist's
repertory.
RPO: Royal Festival Hall. LSO: Barbican Hall; Muldowney commission assisted
by Sema Group plc.

develop a taste for their art. That would seem to set a pretty clear agenda
for those in the business of popularising the arts, which by definition
makers of television documentaries about artists are.
And yet in a fortnight that has seen a wealth of documentaries on artists,
ranging from a mere 10 minutes to a full hour, all but one has taken the
bold step of focusing firmly on the artists' work. The longest and quite the
best of these was Channel 4's film, Two Autumns: The Work of Andy
Goldsworthy in Scotland and Japan (shown on Tuesday 29 September). It lasted
for 60 tranquil, spellbinding minutes, and for my tastes could well have run
on longer.
Producer Peter Chapman evidently had the services of a remarkably good
cameraman and he in turn had the dream subject in Goldsworthy and his
sculptures. Goldsworthy creates these in beautiful rural landscapes using
leaves, pebbles, or strips of bark, siting them exactly so that they will be
transformed by the first rays of sun in the morning, or the last light of
sunset.
Fringes of Japanese maple leaves, stuck around a black rock, blaze gold or
red. Banners of leaves hung on branches turn into translucent green and
black chequer boards. Goldsworthy exploits nature as a theatrical
experience, one which can be repeated perhaps only once more on the
following day, if the wind and current has not already torn apart his work.
This film could itself quite properly be called a work of art. Here were
beautiful images of the art-work and of the artist at work. Rather more
unusually, here was an artist whose own commentary was genuinely
illuminating - either that or he was so tightly edited that neither
pomposity nor flakiness intruded.
So how, then, does Goldsworthy actually live, a viewer might ask? Well, for
one thing he sells photographs of his sculptures. But as to the stages in
his rise to fame, his relations with dealers and clients, the economics of
Goldsworthy's autumn visits to a Japanese village, let alone his private
life - these mundane matters Two Autumns, with blissful discretion, left
quite out of the picture.
On that same rich evening you could have watched Omnibus (BBC 1), The Piero
Trail, celebrating the fifth centenary of this generally beloved artist of
the 15th-century Renaissance. This was a far more orthodox route into an
artist's work, making ample use of 'talking head' academics, architects and
artists to appreciate Piero's art and adumbrate some of the problems it
raises. They did well although I slightly regretted the intrusion of John
Mortimer on to the screen - must he always pop up whenever Italian culture
is discussed?
But within this thoroughly conventional framework, Anna Benson-Gyles had
made good decisions about where to focus. It could have been Piero the man,
his patrons and social world, an attempt to flesh out this still deeply
mysterious figure. That would have been pretty enough, but also pretty
obvious.
Instead, we were introduced to Piero as one of the most brilliant
mathematicians of his age, devising enormously complex perspectival schemes
for his paintings. A three-dimensional recreation of the Urbino
Flagellation, plotted on a computer, amply proved that point, even if it
does not explain to everyone's satisfaction who is being flagellated, and
who the dispassionate gentlemen bystanders are.
This week, however, things had slipped badly out of focus for the Omnibus
film celebrating Roberto Burle Marx who is a Brazilian landscape architect,
garden-designer, town-planner, painter, and conservationist. Now in his
eighties, Marx is evidently a real character. He likes to sing lieder
accompanied by his wife and he gives superb Sunday lunch-parties at his
matchlessly elegant house. Lots of elegant people attend and maybe they
stroll about the matchless gardens. But of course, the main business is to
gossip, laugh at Marx's jokes and eat his perfectly delicious food . . .
So all this is filmed, and eats into the 50 minutes which therefore becomes
much too short to tell us why Marx really is an important figure. Aerial
views of a number of the gardens he has designed did almost nothing to give
an impression of what the gardens are actually like. Admirers, prating on
about Marx's historic, path-beating, mould-breaking importance, merely
sounded like an uncritical chorus of adulation.
It was a flaccid film precisely because it lacked focus, slewing around
between the history of garden design since the 17th century, Marx's
curriculum vitae, and his lunch guests. But there was a very good moment,
when we realised that Marx and Rembrandt have, after all, much in common. We
saw the white-haired maestro in his studio where, he assured the
interviewer, he still spends days at a time 'working until I get tired'.
What we actually saw, however, was the maestro looking on in his
artistically bespattered T-shirt, while assistants applied paint wherever
his finger pointed.
What about taking the other tack, and forgetting about the artist altogether
 -or in the case of Building Sights, the architect? Building Sights is BBC
2's Sunday evening 10-minute spot on 20th-century buildings. It has returned
to our screens for a new series expanded this season into buildings in
Europe.
How well it works, just the perfect length to let an advocate abetted by a
good camera team, make a case for the merits of a factory, airport,
housing-estate, or power-station. Nor is it long enough to outlast the
patience of any opponent of contemporary architecture broadminded enough to
switch on.
The proposers may on occasion look oppressively style-conscious, like Odile
Decq, the French architect who this Sunday presented Jean Nouvel's Nemausus
Housing at Nimes in France. Yet there is never much doubt that they are
really committed to saying why that building really does make a point, and
why they love it. Sometimes the architect gets a look in - but not this week
or last week, a vintage slot for Iannis Xenakis who revisited the convent
Sainte-Marie-la-Tourette which he built with Le Corbusier. But with only 10
minutes to play with, it is always what we see which counts.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Arts: Denholm Elliott - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Denholm Elliott, the actor who typified the diffident Englishman, has died
at the age of 70. His early career was in the theatre, with a West End debut
in The Guinea Pig at the Criterion in 1946. However in the past 30 years it
was cinema and television that made him so familiar. There have been times
in the last decade when viewers might have thought that no single play or
mini-series on the small screen, and no new British movie, was complete
without a cameo performance from Elliott.
He was never a star, his own over-modest comment being 'I was quite good
looking and quite a good actor, I should have been a star, but perhaps it's
the sex appeal I lacked.' Yet the abnormally large amount of work pressed on
him in an over-populated profession proved how highly he was valued. Whether
playing a back-street abortionist in Alfie or a frighteningly recognisable
caricature of a repressed suburban father in Brimstone And Treacle, Elliott
invariably carried conviction.
Born into a family of lawyers, he was educated at Malvern, and served during
the Second World War in the RAF. Shot down and held in a PoW camp, he formed
a drama group and thus developed his interest in acting  - though it was a
profession he never took as seriously as some. With Ralph Richardson he
shared a passion for fast motorbikes, and he enjoyed playing the stock
market.
After the war he met Laurence Olivier in a production of Venus Observed and
his career blossomed. David Lean used him in the 1949 film about jet
aircraft, The Sound Barrier, and he appeared in The Cruel Sea. He gave one
of his most finely judged performances in the more recent Merchant-Ivory
production of Room With A View.
He was married briefly to actress Virginia McKenna and then in 1962 to Susan
Robinson with whom he had a son and a daughter.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Saving water at the root
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fertigation - a combination of fertilisation and irrigation used widely by
fruit and vegetable growers in hot, dry climates - could reduce pollution
and water consumption in cooler, wetter countries such as Britain.
Horticulture Research International, the state-backed agency which carries
out research for the UK fruit and vegetable industry, is investigating
fertigation at its Kirton experimental station in Lincolnshire.
The technique supplies metered quantities of nutrients directly to the roots
of the growing plants through a 'trickle irrigation' system. It requires
thin-walled piping to be laid along each row of crops.
Preliminary results suggest that fertigation could reduce the water and
fertiliser requirements of British vegetable growers, while bringing crops
to market more quickly.
'Results so far have shown a good response in cauliflowers, some of which
matured 18 days earlier than conventionally produced crops,' says Mike Wood
of HRI Kirton.
But he believes the big advantage of the technique would be to eliminate the
need for traditional large-scale 'broadcasting' of nitrogen fertiliser,
together with overhead irrigation which can wash much of it into rivers and
groundwater.
Fertigation also conserves water resources, which are becoming increasingly
scarce in the vegetable-growing areas of eastern England.
Fertigation is already used extensively for growing fruit and high-value
vegetables in parts of the world with hot dry summers, including the
Mediterranean countries, California and Australia.
Its commercial uptake in the UK will depend on developing hardware to match
the very different economics of production in the British climate. But Wood
believes that the technique could be in commercial use by 2000.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: The cost of fear - Putting a
price on risk is not an easy task, but it may help to save lives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'RISK IS about fear, and fear is a shapeless and emotional fact about the
human condition,' surmises John Rimington, director general of Britain's
Health and Safety Executive, the industrial safety regulator.
Putting figures on everyday risks in a formal, scientific way to help judge
whether fear is justified, and how much should be spent to avoid it, is the
target of a five-day conference in London this week, organised by the HSE.
The conference comes at an appropriate moment. The Schipol airport tragedy,
splashed over the front of newspapers on the opening day, was a blatant
reminder not just of the possibility of disaster but also of the cost of
alternatives, such as relocating airports outside cities.
But risk is everywhere, not just in obviously hazardous activities such as
flying or running an oil platform or chemical refinery. On a wider front,
risk assessment deserves attention because of the tangle in which some
environmentalists are thrashing.
It is now clear that the costs of cleaning up the environment can be
extremely high. Many companies and governments are starting to question
whether every last strand of the 'green' legislation passed so
enthusiastically by the EC and US in the past decade justifies that cost.
The concern about EC water directives voiced recently by Ofwat, the UK water
industry regulator, which is worried about customers' bills soaring, is a
case in point.
So 'cost-benefit analysis' has become the buzzword in Brussels and in many
think-tanks. But if the costs of cleaning up are obvious, the benefits to
human life and health from spending a little bit more are often far from
clear.
Answers do not come easily. Risk assessment is a sober, technical subject,
combining the mathematics of probability with detailed projections of
failure in many interlocking pieces of equipment. The HSE has complimented
itself on having produced a 'straightforward account for the general public'
of the risks of nuclear power in its report* this week.
But the method of weighing up risk is straightforward, if the details are
not, and can be set out in three main steps. First, the probability of an
unwanted 'event' needs to be judged. An event can be either a disaster such
as an industrial explosion, or a continuous process such as pesticide
contamination of drinking water.
One of the virtues of the HSE's report on nuclear power is that it is not
shy of including human error in the models - such as the mistaken decision
of the operators of the Three Mile Island plant to shut off its water
sprinklers - although this makes the conclusions less precise.
Biological predictions often pose more problems than engineering ones.
Judging the connection between exposure to toxic substances and cancer later
in life pushes at the limits of the underlying science.
The next step is to put a value on the damage caused if the event happens.
It is highly controversial because it usually means putting a value on human
life. Almost everyone would say that their lives are beyond price. Nor do
they find it much easier to put a price on other people's lives if asked,
for example, how many lives the construction of the Channel Tunnel is worth.
Or - one of many weaknesses in Ofwat's claim that it will consult water
customers about desired standards - how many deaths are justified by Pounds
50 a year off the water bill.
However, if the question makes no sense to the individual, it does at
governmental level. For years the accepted method in cost-benefit analysis
was to put the value of a life at the estimated loss of earnings, plus a
notional sum for the grief of bereaved relatives. Instead, recent studies
have looked at what people pay to avoid danger - sturdier cars, safer
airline, women taking taxis home after dark - and have tried to extrapolate
from that.
On that basis, a 1987 Department of Transport study put a minimum value for
preventing a death of Pounds 660,000 in today's prices. The HSE has adopted
this in its nuclear power study, although it stresses that this is a
minimum.
The last step is at least as debateable as the value of life: deciding on
the level of risk that is tolerable. The route adopted by the HSE is to
compare unfamiliar risks with other more familiar ones that people seem to
find acceptable.
It points out that the risk of being killed in a traffic accident is one
person in 10,000 a year, and the risk of a woman dying in childbirth is one
in 13,000.
It comments too that people are willing to accept higher risks for something
they have control over, such as driving or horse riding, but want far lower
levels of risk in those they do not control, such as water quality or
nuclear power.
Sometimes, where the public's judgment of a risk is not the same as the
scientists', more information can help reassure. However, there are some
hazards that people do not want to face at all, even if the likelihood is
tiny. Many seem to rate death by radiation as much worse than death by
traffic accident.
It would be wrong to dismiss these preferences as 'irrational' says the HSE,
and there may be little that education could do to change them. The enormous
public sensitivity over water standards may fall in this category.
One of the HSE's conclusions is that safety standards in any future nuclear
power stations should be set at a level where the risk to the public is at
least 10 times less than that of a traffic accident.
It points out that this is a much higher standard than used for many
non-nuclear plants. An HSE study of the risk of the installations at Canvey
Island on the Thames several years ago, now accepted as model procedure by
risk analysts, concluded that after safety improvements, the risks had
reduced to a chance of one in 5,000 of a serious accident which might
produce more than 1,500 casualties.
The choice of the tolerable level of risk is a matter for voters and
politicians. But in putting figures on the reasons for fear, from a position
beyond the heat of environmental debate, the formal assessment of risk does
at least start to make the choices intelligible.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Business and the Environment: Bush fuels support by backing
ethanol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BY NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Faced with threatened loss of support from farmers in key Midwest states, a
hard-pressed President Bush last week announced a plan to allow ethanol
(grain alcohol) to be used in reformulated gasoline sold in the nine
smoggiest American cities starting in 1995.
With the president still trailing in the polls behind governor Bill Clinton,
it was a victory for the forces of maize over the combined lobbying efforts
of environmentalists, the oil and natural gas industries.
Farm groups were overjoyed. Ethanol has long been seen as potentially their
most lucrative remaining market, a solution for burdensome global maize
surpluses and a means to reduce US dependence on foreign oil supplies. It
had been a severe setback when the US Environmental Protection Agency
discovered that the ethanol-blended gasoline increases smog, unlike its
closest competitor - methanol. Unless there was some way around it, the EPA
would have favoured methanol for use in the reformulated gasoline programme
which the Clean Air Act designed to clean up the smog in the nine dirtiest
cities. Methanol is made from wood, natural gas, coal, and even rubbish.
But with the White House at stake, there is always a will and a way. Bush
granted a waiver of requirements for gasoline blended with ethanol so it
could be used in 30 per cent of the reformulated gasoline in the smoggy
northern cities. Dirty southern cities can use it in 20 per cent of the
market.
The decision, said Tim Trotter, chairman of the National Corn Growers
Association, 'truly brings about the full promise of clean air legislation
passed two years ago'. Another spokesman for the Corn Growers acknowledged
that while ethanol gasoline could probably meet new Clean Air requirements
in the north, it still would be 'a challenge' in the south where the warmer
air (which has an evaporative effect) would make it difficult.
To further encourage ethanol, Bush said he would ask Congress for an
increase in subsidies. According to Raymond Lewis, president of the American
Methanol Institute, the federal ethanol subsidy could rise to 82 cents a
gallon in addition to some state subsidies, which range from 20-50 cents a
gallon. These make ethanol competitive with methanol, which sells for 40
cents a gallon. The unsubsidised cost of ethanol is 120 cents a gallon.
The president infuriated the oil industry which, in any case, has been angry
about other perceived slights. In order to use ethanol, they said, they
would have to make a costlier, cleaner base fuel and spend millions of
dollars reconfiguring their refineries. The industry said it has already
spent Dollars 500m (Pounds 280m) since 1990 to increase methanol production
capacity. Even more facili-ties are planned and ready to start construction
as soon as the EPA regulations are finalised. 'This politically motivated
decision further rewards the highly subsidised ethanol industry, whose
profits are at a two-year high,' said Charles DiBona, president of the
American Petroleum Institute. 'It hurts oil industry workers whose numbers
have declined by 450,000 over the last 10 years. It does nothing to improve
air quality.'
Angry methanol producers immediately appealed the decision to Congress,
urging it to reject Bush's proposal to give more subsidy proposals. Lewis
fired off a letter to members of a Senate and House tax conference committee
and warned that 'spending federal tax dollars to subsidise an uneconomic
product will discourage private capital investments in unsubsidised products
that can clean up the air in American cities'.
He vowed to continue to fight for methanol. Congress still has to find a
bill this session on which to attach the subsidies, he said, and Bush's
proposal must go through a month-long formal regulatory process in the EPA.
By then the election will be long past.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Management: Fast forward on the disaster front at the BBC /
A look at plans to test the new Producer Choice policy to destruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Greg Parston's main role in life is to encourage executives to fail -
particularly in the public sector. In the past, he has persuaded senior
managers from the East Anglia Regional Health Authority to make a muck of
NHS reforms.
Tomorrow, he will give BBC executives the opportunity to make serious errors
in the implementation of Producer Choice, the Corporation's controversial
new policy that will allow producers to buy services from the outside
market. The simulated disasters are designed to help managers to avoid
failure in the real world.
As executive director of the Office For Public Management, set up to help
public sector managers, he has developed simulations to help hard-pressed
public service managers cope with rapid change and the often conflicting
demands of quality, competition and maximum efficiency.
'We want to help managers explore in advance, without guilt,' says Parston,
an American specialist in organisational behaviour who has also worked in
healthcare management in the US. Because managers usually play themselves in
the simulations and face real problems, Parston believes that management
learning of the highest order occurs. 'They are using their knowledge to
play out what could happen,' he argues.
His first simulation in East Anglia, code-named The Rubber Windmill,
revealed serious potential flaws in heath service reforms. Managers cheated
on quality to balance their budgets. The experience led to the setting of
standard quality objectives.
Above all, Alisdair Liddell, general manager of the East Anglia authority
believes the simulation demonstrated that regulation was needed to stop
managers behaving in a way that could damage the organisation and also that
purchasers of services had to collaborate behind a set of agreed objectives.
The exercises have become annual events and the most recent suggested that
the health service reforms were doomed to collapse within the next four
years into cosy, bureaucratic arrangements that militate against change,
unless action was taken.
If anything similar is likely to happen with the BBC's Producer Choice
initiative, Michael Starks, the executive responsible for introducing the
policy, hopes to start finding out about it this week during two days of
intensive horse-trading at a hotel in Kent.
The BBC exercise, called Fast Forward, will bring together 80 players -
senior managers and those experienced in commercial broadcasting, including
independent producers.
They will use Monopoly money to pay for the commissioning and making of
programmes and to buy and sell services such as camera crews and editing
time. And it will all happen very quickly. Each 15 minutes of the exercise
will represent a month of real time.
Every year will flash by in two-and-a-half-hours, and if everyone plays
their part, the BBC should, by lunchtime on Friday, have accumulated three
years worth of knowledge on what can go wrong with the new policy.
'The trial is not designed to see whether Producer Choice will crash. It is
designed deliberately to crash it. It will enable the BBC to pinpoint and
correct any weaknesses and help us to make sure we get it right when
Producer Choice comes on line (in April),' says Starks.
A dry run involving just 12 people, with consultants from Coopers &amp; Lybrand
representing outside suppliers, threw up one clear conclusion - that the BBC
executives were more entrepreneurial than the consultants.
One of the main potential problems is double spending - that the BBC will be
paying for a high level production base at the same time as producers are
buying more services from the outside market.
More than 90 business units have already drawn up detailed plans to identify
the expected level of demand and prices based on market rates.
The scheme has already led to redundancies as the individual business units
have slimmed down.
As the Monopoly money changes hands this week, the BBC should start to find
out whether the unleashed trading instinct of producers and managers set a
reasonable balance or crash through budgets and undermine the production
base of the Corporation.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Management: Could do better by most accounts - Andrew Jack
has been casting an eye over company annual reports and finds many of them
wanting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual report may be one of the most important forms of communication
between a company and its stakeholders, but it is also one of the least
understood.
In spite of the rapid growth in consultancies to help with production, the
standard annual report remains poorly illustrated, unimaginatively laid-out,
tedious, and short on information and honesty.
There are even some signs that standards are dropping. Each year, the Stock
Exchange and the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales
sponsor an annual reports award; this year the judges took the unusual step
of refusing to give out the prize for the best report from a small company,
arguing that none was of sufficient quality.
A series of studies by design consultancies over the last few months backed
up that verdict and extended it to companies of all sizes. The studies may
be part of efforts by the consultancies to stoke up business. But among the
generalisations and self-promotion are some useful findings.
One of the most outspoken studies has been by Peter Prowse Associates, a
Leatherhead, Surrey-based marketing and communications consultancy. Its
'Company Report Report' earlier this summer names what are seen as bad, as
well as good, examples among the top 50 European quoted companies.
Among the worst offenders, according to Prowse, are Associated British Foods
for 'an unstylish, old-fashioned look'; GUS for 'skimpy brevity'; Holderbank
for being 'deadly dull'; Munich Re and Generali for lack of photographs; and
MD Foods for poor translation.
Other examples are the reports of BTR, which included the phrase 'at the
beginning of 1990, we referred to an apprehension of recession which
materialised soon after'; and Ciba-Geigy, which said: 'A process of
dynamisation with modern forms of leadership and teamwork was started.'
A study by Meridian Design Consultants, based in London, is equally
scathing. Among the reports of the top 100 quoted companies, it found
'chairmen's photos apparently shot in railway station photo booths . . .
people with phones growing out of their ears . . . and tableaux of
terrified-looking factory workers suddenly confronted with the chairman'.
Prowse was critical of the 1991 Boots report's picture of chairman Sir
Christopher Benson for its poor background.
Not all reports are bad. Prowse also highlights good examples among
retailers, including Tesco, Marks &amp; Spencer and Sainsbury. These combine
clarity, ease of reading, direct personal statements from chairmen and chief
executives about objectives and strategy, and graphics illustrating success.
Many companies remain sceptical of the role of designers and their advice.
But David Clutterbuck, chairman of the Item Group, a communications
consultancy, stresses the value of professional help.
He says that with poor design and poor text in a document, people retain
less than 10 per cent of the important messages. With good design and
well-written text, they can retain 50 per cent or more.
Prowse Associates says the best reports have at least five elements:
Persuasion - to convince readers that the company has been well-managed and
is successful, backed up by supporting facts.
Promise - with statements about the future and clear objectives.
Education - basic information on what the company does. It is estimated that
10 per cent of readers are seeing the report for the first time.
Honesty - details of significant events during the year, good or bad, rather
than concealment, which irritates.
Magazine-standard quality - photos, sub-headings, boxes, charts and general
design which makes for easy reading.
Clutterbuck argues that, while reports increasingly reflect the importance
of design, the concentration is on the 'packaging'; text is often neglected
and squeezed in almost as an afterthought.
One problem for those preparing annual reports is having to appeal to
different audiences, from the analyst well versed in financial issues, to
the individual shareholder or employee with very different interests and
less specialist knowledge.
McBride's Design Consultancy discovered that analysts wanted more
information on the value and use of assets, capital expenditure and market
detail. Private shareholders, however, wanted greater detail on long-term
performance and fewer profiles of key staff.
The growing role of professional design may not be entirely positive. Aziz
Cami, of The Partners, another consultancy, says that many reports are
becoming rather formulaic, with a regular structure of mission statement,
financial highlights, a divisional and, increasingly, an environmental
statement.
The wider use of design consultants may also be bad news for those looking
for signs of the true health of the company. An analysis by two academics in
City University Business School in London earlier this year showed that the
use of certain words and phrases in the chairman's statement - such as
'thanks to our bankers for their support' - can often be used as an
indicator of imminent collapse. It is likely that such unguarded comments
are likely to become fewer with the increasing use of consultants to prepare
polished texts.
Before companies go overboard in bringing in expensive consultants, they
might also take heed of one US annual report of a rather different kind
which breaks all the rules. Mark Lee, of Watermark, a corporate identity
consultancy, points to Berkshire Hathaway, the US group controlled by Warren
Buffet.
There is no graphic on the cover, no photos anywhere, and - apart from the
financial statements - nothing inside except the chairman's address, which
is written in a very clear style, rich in homespun homily, and runs to 19
closely-printed pages. The lack of design seems to have done little to harm
Buffet's company, which grew 40 per cent in net worth to Dollars 6.4bn last
year.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Jobs: A sad final bow for the polytechnics - At best only
temporary work for nearly Pounds 650m worth of the products of UK higher
education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST the good news. Last year was the worst on record for young people
seeking work after winning degrees at Britain's universities, polytechnics
and colleges.
At the end of December, near a fifth of the summer's crop of new graduates
were left with no more productive employment than a temporary job expected
to last at most three months. The precise number registered as in that
pickle was 24,893, 19 per cent of the total bachelor-degree output of
130,685, and representing a taxpayers' investment in higher education
approaching Pounds 650m.
The bad news is of course that the present year, although not yet on record,
looks sure to be still worse. The most sober-minded estimate puts demand by
employers at 40 per cent down on the meagre level of a year ago.
An idea of what happened to the crop of 1991 is given by the table
alongside. Unfortunately, owing to a certain laggardliness in official
number-crunching, it omits the lowest of the then three tiers of
degree-level teaching institutions: colleges of higher education which
produce 8.5 per cent of Britain's graduates.
To complicate things further, the two upper tiers are hence-forth to be as
one, with even the few polytechnics that haven't already become universities
about to undergo said apotheosis. But, since they were still polys in 1991,
I have differentiated them as such in the table.
It begins with the total numbers of bachelor's-degree winners produced by
the then two upper tiers last summer, together with the totals the year
before. After the separate figures for the universities and for the polys,
come their combined output for 1991 and the number of graduates by which it
differed from the corresponding figure in 1990: an increase of 6,905.
Reading downwards, we next have - in bold type - the overall numbers who
found jobs in the United Kingdom which were 'regular' in the sense of
holding out career expectations. Below that, in light type, is a break-down
of the types of jobs found. Then comes a similar analysis of the numbers who
continued in education or training in the UK.
Lastly we have other activities broken down into three different groups. The
first lumps together overseas students who returned home with Brits who
moved abroad. The next consists of graduates who had disappeared from their
Alma Mater's ken by the end of the calendar year. The last - 'At best
short-term UK job' - itself includes three types of people.
One is those believed still unemployed at the end of the December. The
second is those deeming themselves not available for employment at all, as
distinct from having re-joined some organisation which had kept them on its
books during their studies. The third is those with only a temporary UK job
likely to last at most three months.
The results of the continued plunge in employers' demand from 1990 to last
year can be seen from the changes in the table's right-hand column.
Every sort of regular work was down except teaching/lecturing, and the
miscellaneous category. There were rises in all types of continued
education. The same went for all the 'other activities', whose combined
increase of 7,627 was over 10 per cent greater than the 6,905 rise in the
universities' and polytechnics' total output.
The single category showing much the biggest increase was 'At best
short-term UK job'. On that particular measure, the universities fared least
badly with 17.2 per cent of their 1991 crop so afflicted. (The colleges of
higher education, not in the table, weren't much worse with 17.9 per cent of
their total graduate output of 11,308 - or 2,027 individuals who, with the
addition of the two upper tiers' 22,866 in the same sad position, produce
the 'precise number' of 24,893 I mentioned earlier.)
The polytechnics fared worst with 22.7 per cent, which is doubly disturbing
when one recalls that it is the reverse of what was promised when most of
them being set up a generation ago. The politicians responsible pledged
that, while having 'parity of academic esteem' with universities, the polys
would be far more geared to serving the employment market.
In the event, of course, they have turned out otherwise. Indeed it seems
odds-on that, of the final output of graduates they have produced under the
name of polytechnics this past summer, at least a quarter will be in the
at-best-short-term category at the end of the year.
Still, that is far from the only example - let alone the most recent - of
politicians' breaking their pledges, or of failing to control the mechanisms
they have brought into being at the taxpayers' expense. And besides, perhaps
the polys' elevation to the title of universities will help them to do
better all round. After all, there is evidence that some employers
snobbishly refused to recruit at them simply because they went under a
lower-status name.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Texaco's Canary Wharf move is on
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXACO, the international oil company, yesterday announced that its UK
headquarters will, after all, move to Canary Wharf. One thousand employees
will move to the London Docklands office complex in the first quarter of
next year.
The lease signed by Texaco is a boost for the insolvent office scheme that
cost more than Pounds 1.5bn to build. It has suffered a succession of
setbacks in recent weeks including the withdrawal of American Express and
Chemical Bank, two of its most prominent tenants.
Mr Alan Bloom, a joint administrator, said that attracting an international
tenant of the standing of Texaco 'will provide a significant boost to our
efforts to ensure the scheme's viability'.
The agreement followed months of negotiations that started when Canary Wharf
went into administration in May. Shortly afterwards Texaco postponed the
move to Canary Wharf that it had planned for August, saying that it was
'determined to ensure our relocation is conducted at the right time, in the
right way and on the right terms'. Texaco said it was pleased with its new
agreement, which met its 'requirements for a headquarters appropriate to the
company's long-term needs'.
The company's decision to move into Canary Wharf reduces Barclays Bank's
Pounds 200m exposure to the project by an estimated Pounds 60m, as the bank
had acted as a third party guarantor for Texaco's lease. Texaco is believed
to have paid about Pounds 30m for a 1,000-year lease on a 230,000 sq ft
building at 1 Westferry Circus, with an option to buy the building or break
the lease after six years. It will also rent an extra 30,000 sq ft on two
floors at 7 Westferry Circus, the adjacent building.
Texaco's decision was not affected by uncertainty surrounding the future of
the extension of London Underground's Jubilee Line to east London. 'Although
we would like the Jubilee Line extension to be built, we have made our
decision on the strength of transport links that are already there,' Texaco
said. 'We always had in mind that the Jubilee Line would not be in place
until the mid to late 1990s.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / Manx economic unit to be set up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CENTRAL economic strat-egic unit will be set up to advise the Isle of Man
government, according to the island government's 1992 policy report
published yesterday.
Mr Miles Walker, the island's chief minister, said the unit would comprise
government officers and should be able to co-opt expertise from out-side.
He said that this year's report was compiled against a very different
economic environment from last year's, although the island - which is a
Crown dependency - had not suffered the same degree of recession as the UK.
Against the background of economic turbulence in the UK, he said, 'we cannot
rely on an expanding revenue with which to fund simultaneously reductions in
taxation, expansion of services and substantial transfers to reserves'.
The island sets its own rate of income tax - currently 10 per cent - and
manages its own internal economic and political affairs. It is not part of
the European Community but is linked to it via protocols through the UK.
The report said Manx government policy would be to promote the island as
'offshore Europe'. The formation of the European Economic Area would
increase the number of countries with which the Isle of Man may trade
freely.
Manx gross national product rose 4 per cent last year to Pounds 509m, but
has slowed and is expected to rise by about 1 per cent this year.
The finance sector remains the highest income producer, with 34 per cent of
GNP, but the report affirms the government's commitment to diversify the
economy.
However, the government feels 'it would be unrealistic and ultimately
detrimental to the island to artificially limit expansion of successful
businesses in the finance industry because other industries are more
seriously affected by external recessionary pressures'.
A heavy legislative load is predicted for the next three years, with at
least 70 bills scheduled to go before the island's parliament on issues
including financial and fiscal matters, health, environment, individual
rights and law and order.
A bill mirroring Westminster's Police and Criminal Evidence Act is on the
agenda for the coming year. Plans are also under way for a statutory
committee of lay people to advise on policing matters and an independent
commissioner to be appointed to investigate complaints against the police.
One item expected to go through before the end of this year is the
restoration to Manx residents of the right of petition to the European
Commission on Human Rights.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Tax body warns of poor legislation: Budget Submission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIME between the Budget and the legislation arising from it should be
extended to curb poorly drafted legislation, the Institute of Taxation has
warned.
The institute, which represents tax professionals, said in its annual
representation on the Budget to the Inland Revenue that there had been a
decline in the quality of legislation in the past few years.
It said government proposals on reform of the Budget would reduce the period
during which tax legislation is open for discussion from 90 days to 70 days
and would increase the risk of poor legislation. The institute said the
finance bill should be published in January, but with its second and third
readings as at present in order to extend the consultation period.
It also backed the idea of a technical financial bill outside the normal
Budget timetable. Mr Ian Luder, chairman of the institute's technical
committee said: 'This is a golden opportunity to improve the quality of
legislation,' He said some recent attempts to introduce legislation had been
'farcical'.
The institute also criticised the growing use of extra-statutory concessions
and statements of practice as a substitute for legislation.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BARCLAYCARD, the card payments arm of Barclays, plans to help set up a new
consumer debt counselling service with a network of up to 25 centres
covering 90 per cent of the UK population, David Barchard writes.
The scheme is modelled on the US National Foundation for Consumer Credit in
Houston, Texas.
Debtors will be given help in arranging repayment programmes to clear their
problem loans over agreed periods of up to four years by paying the credit
counselling service a fixed amount each month.
The service then shares the payment out between an individual's creditors.
Barclaycard says that, unlike other debt-counselling services which have to
be maintained through donations, this one will fund itself through
contributions from creditors linked to debt repayment.

PROTESTS about the failure of Mr Lamont to meet the European parliament's
monetary and economic committee are expected to erupt when the group meets
today, Ralph Atkins writes.
Socialist MEPs are calling for Mr Lamont to stand down as head of the
Council of Economic and Finance Ministers (Ecofin) after refusing to meet
the committee last week to report on Britain's withdrawal from the exchange
rate mechanism. Mr Alan Donnelly, Labour MEP for Tyne and Wear, said the
chancellor was giving 'no direction or guidance' to Ecofin.
The parliament has no direct authority over the finance ministers' council,
but the EC presidency, now held by Britain, is expected to report on its
deliberations to MEPs.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Baker joins rebel ranks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH BAKER form-ally joined the ranks of the Tory backbench rebels
yesterday, making clear that, without significant changes to the text of the
Maastricht treaty, he would not support government efforts to ratify it.
But he was challenged by Mr Kenneth Clarke, his successor as home secretary,
over whether or not he opposed Britain's entry into the European exchange
rate mechanism two years ago.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4, Mr Clarke asserted that 'in the end' only Baroness
Thatcher and Lord Ridley were against entry. 'If any of the others were
against it, they fooled me,' he said.
In Mr Baker's words, however: 'I argued against it and against going in at
DM2.95. I lost, but I was assured that there would be flexibility.'
Britain was 'well out of' the European exchange rate mechanism, he argued
later, saying the government must choose between floating exchange rates and
a single currency, and that he would prefer the first of these options.
Leading a number of leading Euro-sceptics on the conference fringe
yesterday, Mr Baker outlined his reservations to Maastricht on subsidiarity,
Commission powers and border controls, telling his packed audience he saw
little prospect of amendments being adopted that would enable him to support
ratification.
'It seems unlikely to me that these conditions on these three matters . .
will be met,' he said. 'I don't believe that they can be fulfilled.'
Questioned later, he said that if there were no changes, 'then I will not
support the treaty'.
Clearly relishing life outside the cabinet, Mr Baker called for European
commissioners to be replaced by heads of department 'rather like the
permanent secretaries of our own ministries'. These would simply execute
decisions taken by the council of ministers and would not have 'their own
political agendas'.
On the domestic economy, he called for an immediate 1 point cut in interest
rates 'with a target of 6 per cent within a matter of months.'
He predicted: 'Even after interest rate cuts, inflation in Britain next
spring could be below 3 per cent.'
Elsewhere, Lord Tebbit characterised the Maastricht treaty as 'a timebomb'
threatening to 'destroy utterly' what the Community's founding fathers set
out to create.
Speaking before his galvanic address to conference, he said that if there
was not a UK referendum, voters would believe the democratic system did not
work - and 'that is the language of the National Front'.
Mr John Biffen, another former cabinet minister, predicted: 'The fight you
have seen taking place in this conference will go on and on and on,'
claiming that Euro-scepticism was 'no longer the gift of a handful of rather
romantic Tory MPs'.
Sir Teddy Taylor, MP for Southend East, was on the rampage, claiming there
would be no point in voting at the next general election if Maastricht were
ratified.
'Our liberty is almost gone, this would be the end,' he said, also calling
for a referendum on the treaty.
'(The people's) advice and approval is needed before we sign.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Tebbit electrifies
anti-Maastricht forces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEP divisions within the Conservative party over Maastricht were
brutally exposed by Lord Tebbit yesterday as he seized on the debate on
Europe to press the government to abandon ratification of the treaty.
In an electrifying address the former party chairman won round after round
of passionate applause from the treaty's opponents and provoked charges of
'Brutus' from Tory MEPs.
But his rabble-rousing oratory and undisguised criticisms of Mr John Major
were met with a calm and dextrous counter-attack from Mr Douglas Hurd, who
warned that the party risked breaking itself over Europe.
'Let us decide to give that madness a miss,' he said to widespread applause.
The foreign secretary's forthright defence of the government's achievements
in the Maastricht negotiations - widely praised as a masterful performance -
ensured that the highly vocal anti-treaty faction was defeated by an
estimated margin of about 4 to 1 on an innocuous motion.
The wording congratulated the government on its European Community
presidency alongside an amendment seeking reforms to halt 'unnecessary
interference from Brussels' and a more open, accountable community.
Prior to the debate, many Conservatives had claimed that newspaper reports
of a deep schism within the party on Maastricht were false. In the event,
the ferocity of the head-on clash between opponents and supporters of
Maastricht was far greater than any had predicted.
Speaker after speaker sought, amid a cacophony of cheers and boos, to
polarise the party between government loyalists and the distinctly more
vociferous rebels.
In their opening speeches, the movers sought to shut down the controversy by
insisting that the enforcement of subsidiarity rules - devolving powers as
closely as possible to those they could effect - would rectify the treaty's
weaknesses.
That hope was abruptly brushed aside when Dr Bernard Juby of Birmingham
Yardley declared to a roar: 'The Maastricht treaty is dead - the Danes saw
to that.'
His theme was taken up and expanded when Lord Tebbit was welcomed to the
platform with delegates on their feet in many parts of the hall.
As a grim-faced platform looked on, the one-time Chingford MP offered curt
congratulation to Mr Major's election victory, before going on to warn that
the government was now 'in desperate trouble' with Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, under attack even in the normally loyal Conservative press.
Then, in a clear sideswipe at the prime minister, who oversaw the UK's entry
into the exchange rate mechanism, he added: 'I hope you will stand by your
chancellor - it was not Norman Lamont's decision to enter the ERM. He did
his best to make the unworkable work.
'The cost in lost jobs, bankrupt firms, repossessed homes, in the terrible
wounds inflicted on industry, has been savage.'
Lord Tebbit then set about Maastricht, claiming that 'a great tide of
opinion' opposed to a federal community was engulfing Europe.
With a direct challenge to Mr Major to 'raise the flags of patriots of all
the states of Europe', he called on the prime minister to launch the drive
for a treaty with 'no mention of more power for Brussels, no mention of
economic, monetary and political union.'
But Lord Tebbit was not without his critics. Immediately he sat down, Mrs
Pamela Parker from East Surrey won applause from elsewhere in the hall when
she declared her fury with his stance, warning that he was offering
'political suicide'.
As opponents demanded a referendum, other loyalists underlined that the
country would suffer dire consequences for industry if it abandoned Europe.
Mr Malcolm Harbour from Solihull said thousands of jobs had been created by
foreign investment and Britain was at the heart of Europe.
Critics should 'go out into the streets of Sunderland and argue that they do
not want the jobs created by us being at the heart of Europe,' he said.
When Mr Hurd rose, his appeal was for cool heads. He stressed common ground
in the party pointing out that very few opposed EC membership or advocated a
European super-state.
'We are winning the arguments - now is not the time to kick over the table,'
he said.
Mr Hurd then went on to put the argument for Britain maintaining the stance
it had taken prior to the election and in Commons' votes since.
'We don't want Britain to be on the sidelines when the security and
prosperity of Europe are being decided.
'We know in our bones it's not safe, it's not wise, it's not right.'
The foreign secretary promised that an explanatory booklet explaining the
treaty would be made available and promised he would seek to establish ways
of minimising interference by Brussels and means of increasing openness in
decision-making.
Summing up, Mr Hurd evoked what was once dubbed the white man's burden,
concluding: 'In the name of that tradition . . I ask for your support as we
extend and strengthen the effort which we, the British, make for a safer and
more decent world.'
His ovation was duly granted him.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Chancellor to emphasise
fight against inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, will use his speech tomorrow to emphasise
the government's determination to defeat inflation.
Normally, the annual gathering of the Tory faithful would not be considered
a suitable audience for an exposition of government economic policy. But in
a break with tradition the chancellor is expected to devote a substantial
part of his speech to policy questions to counter widespread criticism
following sterling's departure from the European exchange rate mechanism
three weeks ago.
During tomorrow's debate on the economy, Mr Lamont will develop his idea of
using a number of financial indicators, encompassing measures of narrow and
broad money supply growth, asset prices including house prices and the
exchange rate, to determine monetary policy. He will also underline the
government's wish to get a grip on the UK's rapidly growing public sector
borrowing requirement through control of public expenditure rather than any
increase in taxation.
However, Mr Lamont is likely to avoid giving a very detailed description of
the government's policy stance tomorrow. His meeting next Monday with the
Commons Treasury and Civil Service committee will provide a better
opportunity for expounding macro-economic policy, while the annual Mansion
House speech to the City on October 29 is still seen as the occasion for
giving a comprehensive analysis of monetary policy.
Government officials yesterday insisted that sterling's sharp fall since
Black Wednesday was not a sign that the government was turning away from
tight policies designed to reduce inflation.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Tube extension set to be
shelved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROPOSED extension of the Jubilee Line to London's Docklands is set to
join the lengthening list of casualties of the toughest public spending
round since the early 1980s.
Ministers at the Conservative conference said yesterday that the Treasury
now looked certain to win its battle to have the project shelved, if not
scrapped, in the wake of the collapse of the Canary Wharf development.
Only an unconditional offer from the banks now administering the Docklands
development to meet in full the Pounds 400m private sector contribution
promised by Olympia &amp; York could rescue the project.
A final decision to shelve the project, yielding a Pounds 1.5bn saving for
the Treasury, could be made as early as next week at a meeting of the
cabinet committee chaired by Lord Wakeham.
As ministers acknowledged that the government was still struggling to meet
the Pounds 244.5bn spending target agreed for next year, Mr William
Waldegrave, the minister responsible for the Citizen's Charter, announced a
big extension of the market-testing of Whitehall services.
In an effort to square the circle of tight spending constraints and improved
public services, he said that the politics of the 'growth of government'
were dead.
Instead, he said, the improvement in the quality of public services offered
by the charter would help 'end the false choice between low rates of
taxation and higher standards of service'.
Mr Waldegrave said that, as part of the drive for efficiency, more than
Pounds 1bn-worth of services now delivered by civil servants in Whitehall
would be market-tested this year by inviting private sector competition.
The sharp increase from a figure of only Pounds 25m last year would mean
that a whole range of professional services such as accountancy and
information technology would join more traditional services such as security
and catering in being exposed to private-sector disciplines.
Mr Waldegrave's speech also followed predictions from senior ministers that
the government may face a 'spring of discontent' from public sector unions
next year in response to draconian measures to hold down the government's
pay bill.
The ministers said that the cabinet committee reviewing the allocation of
next year's Pounds 244.5bn Whitehall budget would not set a formal pay
'norm' for the public sector. But most workers could expect increases of
between zero and 3 per cent.
Despite the proposed scrapping of the Jubilee line extension, Mr Waldegrave
said that the government was aiming to protect as many as possible of those
of its investment programmes than directly affected demand in the private
sector - particularly the construction industry.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Party chairman appeals
for unity and resolve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG appeal for the unity and resolution that characterised the Tory
party in the 1980s came yesterday from Sir Norman Fowler, the party
chairman.
With the prime minister facing growing divisions on Europe and the economy,
Sir Norman acknowledged that the conference was about future issues. He
said: 'We stand or fall as one party. We have won more elections than any
other party in Britain because we are the most united and most determined
party in Britain.'
In his first conference speech as party chairman, Sir Norman said that the
lesson of the Thatcher years was that the Tories' electoral successes had
come from their discipline and determination to keep to long-term aims.
'Over the same period Labour have been the most divided and most
undisciplined party in Britain. We should not contemplate going down their
road - the socialist road of division,' he warned.
'That is why they have lost . . and lost again.'
'The lesson is that we must all stand together, and I do mean all: in our
branches, in our associations, in our areas, in our local councils and yes,
if I may say so, among our MPs at Westminster too.
'In this hall and across the country there are thousands of people who
worked themselves to the bone on the doorsteps and pavements of Britain to
get this party elected. We must stay true to them.'
Speaking just a couple of hours ahead of yesterday afternoon's debate on
Europe, he reminded the conference of the setbacks and hard times in the
early 1980s over controversial issues such as trade union reforms and the
first privatisations.
There was vigorous applause from delegates when his call for party unity
explicitly included MPs, a few of whom have irritated some rank and file
party members by their open rebellion on the Maastricht treaty.
Sir Norman said that the question of Britain's future in Europe was one of
the three great issues for the 1990s. He used rhetoric reminiscent of the
Euro-sceptics to emphasise the government's commitment to oppose a federal
Europe and its goal of 'a Europe of nation states where decisions are taken
as close as possible to the people'.
His speech also aimed to remind the conference of the debt owed to Mr John
Major for the election victory - which Sir Norman described as a 'personal
triumph' for the prime minister.
The applause was, however, at least as loud for the mention of Lady Thatcher
as 'one of the great leaders of our party'.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Councils to face curbs
on spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTRODUCTION of the council tax will not shield councils from curbs on
public spending, Mr John Redwood, minister for local government, warned
yesterday.
'It is important that local, like central, government does its best to
control costs,' he said, adding that Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, had comprehensive capping powers which he intended to use if
necessary.
'Next year is not going to be easy financially,' he said during a debate on
local government.
'It's a year when the Conservative virtues of efficiency and better value
for money will be much needed.'
Details of restrictions on councils' share of public spending will not
emerge until the chancellor makes his Autumn Statement.
Mr Redwood said there was a 'strong mood' in favour of more efficiency,
better value for money and more contracting out of local government
services.
Mr Redwood reassured delegates that the new tax would be easier to sell to
the public than the poll tax. 'Transitional relief will be an important part
of the system,' he said.
He later signalled that the scheme might last no more than two years.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The Conservative Party At Brighton: Clarke attacks
Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ALTERNATIVE vision of the Conservatives as positive Europeans was spelt
out by senior ministers yesterday as Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary,
led the counter-attack on the Euro-sceptics with a call for the party to
recover its self-confidence and convictions.
At an evening fringe meeting organised by the Thatcherite Conservative Way
Forward group, Mr Clarke insisted that Conservatives would not be driven
into schism by the debate about Europe. He was unequivocal in stressing that
the party must rediscover clear aims and policies, and recognise that 'we
are all Europeans'.
He recalled as 'the golden years of Thatcher's Britain' the mid-to-late
1980s when the government was cohesive and the party was not weakened by the
doctrinal divide between 'wets' and 'dries'.
Mr Clarke argued that the Maastricht treaty was not an exercise in damage
limitation, but represented an improvement in the way the EC worked. The EC
would continue to evolve and, he warned: 'We must decide quickly what we do
want, and we cannot do nothing.'
The community had always had a political dimension, and the Tory government
since 1979 had not opted out of that development, he said.
Mr Clarke emphasised that political co-operation paved the way for greater
economic liberalism, about which the party continues to be enthusiastic. 'It
is not possible to have a genuine free-trade area without any political
strings.'
A more combative strand of the argument had been developed earlier by Mr
John Gummer, the agriculture minister, who accused the Euro-sceptics of
being selective in their approach to EC discussions.
Within minutes of the main conference debate on Europe finishing, Mr Gummer
used a debate on farming to argue that the lesson of Napoleon's and Hitler's
domination of Europe was that Britain's 'eternal interest' was to preserve
the balance of power in Europe.
Mr Gummer did not mention Lord Tebbit, former party chairman, but the target
was clear in his attacks on 'the people who thought we could opt out; that
it was nothing to do with us'.
He told the conference: 'I say to the Euro-sceptics that you can't do that
on an 'in-and-out' basis. You can't pick and choose. You can't play only
when you think you are going to win.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / Holding tight on a roller-coaster ride: The currency turmoil
since Black Wednesday is unlikely to ease until economic policy is clear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN EXCHANGE markets do not seem to know what to do with Britain's
devalued currency. But Britain's exporters cannot afford simply to wait and
see where sterling eventually ends up. Their marketing strategies and
expected profits depend on estimates made now about where the pound will be
both in three months and three years.
So where might the pound end once the excitement dies down? And what kind of
rollercoaster ride can sterling expect on the foreign exchanges in the
meantime?
Economists like to believe that exchange rates are determined according to
the predictions of their economic theories. The daily gyrations in the
markets may be the result of market speculators and the interventions of
central banks. But, in the medium term, all this market noise should wash
out leaving economic 'fundamentals' to determine the currency's value.
Typically, though, economists disagree about which 'fundamental' forces
count. Take two apparently simple questions. Was sterling overvalued in the
European exchange rate mechanism at a central rate of DM2.95? Is it now
undervalued relative to other European currencies at around DM2.40? Ask a
group of economists and you will get at least as many different answers as
economists.
Those who said that sterling was correctly valued at DM2.95 were using the
'purchasing power parity' valuation method. This says that the correct
exchange rate between any two currencies is the one which equalises the
price of the same traded item in both countries. If cars are cheaper in one
country, then traders should buy them and export them to make a profit. But
this will push up that country's exchange rate until price parity is
restored.
The charts show purchasing power parity exchange rates for the UK, US and
Germany over the past decade. They are based on a basket of similar goods
compiled by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and
use trade-weighted exchange rates. They suggest that sterling was overvalued
before Black Wednesday on September 16 - UK exports were, on average
slightly more expensive than those of competitors.
But the effective 11 per cent devaluation of sterling has more than
eliminated this disadvantage - it is now 6 per cent undervalued in
trade-weighted terms. And its previous overvaluation was largely due to the
undervaluation of the US dollar, as the US chart shows. Calculations by
Goldman Sachs, the investment bank, suggest that sterling is now undervalued
 -by 14 per cent against the overvalued D-Mark and by 3 per cent against the
French franc.
Does this mean that sterling must eventually appreciate against European
currencies or alternatively that UK inflation must be higher than elsewhere
to bring UK export prices into line? The track record of purchasing power
parity rates suggests not. They have, in fact, been a very poor guide to
actual exchange-rate valuations over the past decade.
The reason is that purchasing power parity calculations ignore many other
economic 'fundamentals' other than export prices which determine whether a
country's exchange rate is sustainably valued. To compete with German
manufacturers at DM2.95, UK exporters had to sell their goods at comparable
prices. But there were too few UK exporters who were able to do so at that
exchange rate. So Britain is left with a relatively small and unprofitable
export sector and a trade deficit at the bottom of a recession as a result.
The alternative method - called 'fundamental equilibrium exchange rates' to
scare off the uninitiated - uses macroeconomic models to estimate the
exchange rate at which the economy can return the trade account into rough
balance in the medium term. The fundamental equilibrium charts tell a very
different tale. They suggest, in direct contradiction to the purchasing
power parity figures, that the D-Mark has been consistently undervalued over
the past decade, as its large trade surpluses suggested. The US dollar is
undervalued in purchasing power parity terms but correctly valued using the
fundamental equilibrium method.
In fundamental equilibrium terms, sterling was overvalued at DM2.95 - by
about 15 per cent according to Mr Ray Barrell at the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research. The institute argued in October 1990 that
sterling should enter the ERM at a lower rate. But sterling's subsequent
fall since Black Wednesday to around DM2.40 means that it is now correctly
valued. Enough British exporters can have a profitable existence to balance
the current account so long as the competitive gains are not frittered away
in higher inflation.
Yet even if the current exchange rate is an acceptable final resting place
for sterling, the chances are high that it will have to fall further in the
meantime.
Why must sterling overshoot? UK interest rates are already lower than in
most other European countries and are expected to fall further. Investors
will continue to hold sterling only if they can also expect capital gains
from an appreciation of the currency. So sterling must fall far enough so
that it can both appreciate and arrive back at a reasonable resting place.
But how large must this overshoot be? The farther that markets expect
sterling interest rates to fall relative to those in continental Europe, the
farther traders must push sterling down. That is why the lack of a clearly
articulated government economic strategy is destabilising.
The chances are that currency analysts have been studying the behaviour of
policymakers in the US, Australia, New Zealand and Canada, using charts such
as those shown, to gain some clues as to how the Treasury might act. These
are the countries which, like the UK, have experienced serious debt-related
recessions. They have all responded by cutting short-term interest rates
aggressively, in all cases below those in Germany.
Far from leading to a build-up of inflationary pressure, they have also seen
inflation and long-term interest rates fall relative to those in Germany.
The cost has been large exchange-rate depreciations against the D-Mark, in
all cases at least twice as large as sterling's fall so far.
Will the UK take the same route? The gain would be a relief for hard-pressed
consumers and bankers. The risk is that a temporary fall in sterling towards
DM2.00 would encourage Britain's famed inflationary tendencies. But unless
the government speaks out soon, the markets are likely to anticipate that
more cuts in interest rates are coming - and sell sterling accordingly.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Pounds troubles blamed as Sanyo sheds jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SANYO ELECTRIC Manufac-turing (UK), a subsidiary of the Japanese electronics
group, said yesterday that the weakness of sterling against the yen had
contributed to a decision to shed about 95 jobs - a third of the workforce -
at its microwave ovens plant at Newton Aycliffe, County Durham.
The company, which buys some components from Japanese suppliers other than
Sanyo, said the yen's relative strength and high interest rates had worsened
problems caused by the recession.
The 'difficult decision' to restructure at the Newton Aycliffe plant, which
formed part of an Pounds 11m investment in the region announced only four
years ago, was necessary to ensure it survived.
Mr Ron Bell, assistant to the plant's managing director, said: 'We're trying
to re-establish ourselves in a very competitive market.'
The Newton Aycliffe plant has been selling 70 per cent of its output in the
UK and the rest in continental Europe. Mr Bell said hopes of an imminent end
to the recession had not been realised. The floating of the pound had not
helped investor confidence, he added.
The investment in the region, for which Sanyo received substantial UK
government regional grant aid, was expected in 1988 to create more than 500
jobs.
It was greeted as an example of the region's economic regeneration through
Japanese investment. Sanyo employs 283 people at Newton Aycliffe and 24 at
its magnetron plant at Thornaby-on-Tees, Cleveland, which is not affected by
the job cuts.
The EETPU section of the AEEU engineering and electrical union has
single-union status at the Newton Aycliffe plant where a pendulum
arbitration agreement - in effect a no-strike deal - is in force.
Consultation with the union on the job losses has begun.

FT  07 OCT 92 / FT Latin American Capital Markets: Markets face rash of new
issues from Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL financial markets will face severe difficulties absorbing
prospective new issues of debt and equity planned by Latin American
entities, a Financial Times conference was told yesterday.
Mr Stephen Dizard, head of trading in Salomon Brothers' emerging markets
department in New York, estimated that Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.2bn) of new
bond issues were being lined up for issuance over the next 12 months, with
about Dollars 4bn due to come to market in the 10 business weeks before the
end of the year.
He doubted such a volume could be accommodated in this time, which would
then push this year's new issue calendar into 1993. He also said the desire
by some issuers, including banks, to bring riskier new structures to the
market was likely to be disappointed in the short term. Such structures
included attempts to bring convertible bond issues to market and
subordinated debt to boost capital.
He said the market in Latin American bonds was undergoing a transition,
under which big institutional investors could play a more important part. So
far the market has been dominated by speculators and individual buyers.
The conference on Latin American Capital Markets was overshadowed by the
recent instability in financial markets in the industrialised world. This
was viewed as discouraging investors from looking into the supposedly
riskier emerging markets in Latin America and elsewhere.
Several speakers said the unreliability of international capital markets
underlined the importance of developing domestic capital markets in the
region and the need for pension fund reform, which would help achieve this
end.
Ms Jane Moncreiff, head of emerging markets for J P Morgan in London, noted
that most new Latin American issues in the international equity market were
trading below their issue price as a result of market falls. The Argentine
stock market has fallen 52 per cent from its highs earlier in the year and
the market in Brazil is down 30 per cent.
She and other speakers said that, in view of the tendency for issuers of
equity and debt to attempt to raise money at the same time, Latin American
governments should consider introducing a queuing system for would-be
issuers.
Mr Lincoln Rathnam, managing director of the fund managers Scudder, Stevens
&amp; Clark, said he believed that Latin debt markets constituted a 'far surer
play' than the Latin equity markets as the outlook for equity investment in
Latin America was so uncertain.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Tax filibuster upsets legislative timetable
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate was yesterday struggling to tie up legislative loose ends
before going into recess ahead of next month's election.
After delivering a stinging rebuke to President George Bush on Monday night
by overriding his veto of legislation to re-regulate the cable television
industry, the Senate timetable was derailed by a lengthy filibuster of a
Dollars 27bn tax and urban aid bill.
The bill, which proposes the creation of 59 new enterprise zones and a
package of individual and corporate tax breaks, was held up in a one-man
'talkathon' by New York Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato, seeking to add
to the bill protection for workers faced with job losses in his home state.
'I'm just getting my second wind,' the senator declared to an almost
deserted Senate yesterday morning after holding the floor virtually
throughout the night. After trying to delay the recess until he got his way,
Mr D'Amato withdrew yesterday afternoon having learned the House had
adjourned, scuppering chances of the full Congress considering his
amendment.
Earlier, both houses had voted by the more than two-thirds majorities
required to overturn Mr Bush's veto of cable television legislation, which
allows the Federal Communications Commission to set 'reasonable' rates for
basic cable services.
Mr Bush said yesterday the override, the first of his presidency after 35
successful vetoes, was a result of the television networks ganging up
against the cable industry.
Asked if the defeat would hurt Mr Bush's chances of re-election, his
Democratic rival Governor Bill Clinton replied: 'It won't do him any good.'
It was unclear yesterday if Mr Bush would seek to veto the tax bill. While
Mr Bush approves of many of its provisions, he is unhappy with technical
changes, such as increased payments required of those individuals and
corporations who file quarterly estimated tax payments, which could be
construed as tax increases.
The delay to the bill also held up senators' consideration of a House-Senate
compromise bill aimed at encouraging the use of alternative fuels and
boosting energy conservation. Majority leader George Mitchell said the
Senate would sit until Monday if need be to finish its work.
On Monday both houses gave final approval to a Dollars 14bn foreign aid
bill, which includes Dollars 10bn in loan guarantees for Israel and Dollars
417m in aid for the former Soviet republics.

FT  07 OCT 92 / BNL loans case judge criticises White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE judge presiding over the case of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.8bn) of illegal
Iraqi loans made by the Atlanta branch of Italy's Banca Nazionale del Lavoro
(BNL) has made a blistering attack on the Bush administration's handling of
the scandal, accusing officials of interfering in the prosecution.
Judge Marvin Shoob, in an unusual judicial ruling that sets the stage for a
full trial of Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL Atlanta manager, said
there were 'grave questions as to how the prosecutors made their decisions
in this case'.
The judge's order came after prosecutors last week stopped a hearing aimed
at sentencing Mr Drogoul and agreed he should be allowed to change his plea
from guilty to innocent.
'It is apparent that decisions were made at the top levels of the United
States Justice Department, State Department, Agriculture Department and
within the intelligence community to shape this case and that information
may have been withheld from local prosecutors seeking to investigate the
case,' the judge wrote in a court order released yesterday.
Judge Shoob, who disqualified himself from further handling of the case
because he had already formed opinions, also called for the formal BNL trial
to be postponed to allow a special prosecutor to be named. He said the
refusal last summer by Mr William Barr, attorney-general, to name an
independent prosecutor 'itself raises concerns for the court about the
government's impartiality in handling this case'.
The judge said a special prosecutor needed to obtain the facts rather than
continue to accept the administration's claim that Mr Drogoul was the sole
orchestrator of the Iraqi loans. This premise was dismissed by the judge as
a way 'to avoid embarrassing a foreign government or to contain criticism of
a failed foreign policy'.
Separately, in his first comment on the case, Mr Bill Clinton said on
national television that a special prosecutor should investigate the
administration's dealings with Iraq before the August 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
Judge Shoob concluded in his ruling that officials at BNL's head office in
Rome 'were aware of and approved Mr Drogoul's activities' on behalf of Iraq.
He also said 'it is likely that the United States intelligence agencies were
aware of BNL-Atlanta's relationship with Iraq'.
He added that Washington stopped US investigators from conducting a serious
investigation of the BNL head office's involvement in the scandal, which he
said was 'coupled with or provoked by the involvement of other departments
of the US government' in the scandal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DR Cheddi Jagan, a former marxist who now advocates market economics, has
taken an early lead in the race to be the next president of Guyana,
following Monday's election.
With about 20 per cent of the votes counted last night, Dr Jagan's
opposition People's Progressive party (PPP) had just over 62 per cent, with
the incumbent People's National Congress (PNC) party of President Desmond
Hoyte winning 33 per cent. The remaining votes were shared by nine other
parties, none of which is expected to win.
Election officials said last night the counting of votes was slow,
attributing this to the outbreak of violence and looting on Monday in
Georgetown, the capital.
Heavily armed soldiers and policemen patrolled the city last night. There
was sporadic gunfire, shops and offices remained closed, public transport
was limited, and most residents stayed home.
Two people were killed, several injured and just under 200 arrested in
violence which began when supporters of the PNC attacked the offices of the
independent Elections Commission, claiming they were being prevented from
voting.
Mr Hoyte said he 'empathised' with the complaints of his supporters, but
that he did not condone the violence. He then called out the army to support
the police.
The violence had cast doubt on the completion of what is widely held to be
the country's first fair elections in 30 years.
Foreign observers led by Mr Jimmy Carter, the former US president, and Mr
David Peterson, former premier of Ontario province, Canada, are monitoring
the elections and the counting of ballots. Any fraud would be detected, they
said.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Polls hammer home task facing Baker: Disenchantment with
George Bush is widespread
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES Baker is, according to those who never see him, moving might and main
behind the scenes to bring off the greatest political resurrection since
Lazarus (also known as Harry) Truman. President George Bush as good as said
on Sunday that he looked forward to having his good friend running the
nation's foreign policy again in a second term.
Some of those who have caught sight of Mr Baker in the flesh recently report
something different - that he is playing more weekend golf than he ever did
as secretary of state. This denotes, in the view of Washington gossips,
either massive confidence that Mr Bush will win or that only a miracle
beyond his earthly powers can save the Bush presidency from defeat a month
from now.
The second opinion was in the ascendancy yesterday with the publication of
new national and state polls. Their message was virtually uniform; that the
political balance in the US, having been volatile for the first 7 1/2 months
of the year, has become stable and that the election looks sewn up for
Governor Bill Clinton, the Democratic candidate.
A national Harris poll gives Mr Clinton 53 per cent, Mr Bush 36 per cent and
Mr Ross Perot, the independent, 9 per cent. The Washington Post/ABC News
split is 48-35-9 and that of the New York Times/CBS News 46-38-7.
An ABC 'map' of the 10 biggest states, comprising 257 of the 270 Electoral
College votes needed for victory, finds Mr Bush ahead in none, with serious
chances only in Texas and Florida.
Overall, it has Mr Clinton leading in 31 states with 367 college votes, Mr
Bush up in 11 with 71 and the remaining nine, with 100 electors, too close
to call. New state polls show Mr Clinton up by 20 points in Illinois, 19 in
Colorado, 13 in Michigan and Missouri, and seven in Ohio and Kansas. Mr Bush
is ahead by six points in Wyoming and two in South Carolina.
It seems that virtually nowhere is Mr Perot having any significant impact.
The New York Times poll reported 'overwhelming hostility' among voters to
his entry into the race. Nearly three quarters of those surveyed said he
should never have returned to the race.
This poll found that such limited support as Mr Perot was getting was drawn
equally from Mr Bush and Mr Clinton. The Washington Post survey, however,
found Mr Perot's presence on the ballot hurting the president more as it
offered an alternative to those strongly opposed to Mr Clinton.
But the worst news in all the surveys concerns the prevailing pessimism
about the state of the nation and Mr Bush's perceived ability to do anything
about it. The Washington Post, for example, reported that eight in 10
thought the country was headed in the wrong direction and six in 10 that the
economy was getting worse.
It found that one central thrust of the Bush campaign - that Mr Clinton
would tax Americans into poverty - was simply not working. Of registered
voters, 40 per cent thought Mr Clinton would do a better job on taxation,
against 28 per cent for Mr Bush and 16 per cent for Mr Perot.
The New York Times found the president's overall approval rating down to 37
per cent, a five point drop over the last month.
Only 16 per cent approved of the way he was managing the economy.
Mr Bush's best, perhaps only, hope now lies in the three upcoming televised
debates, starting in St Louis on Sunday. The president and Vice-President
Dan Quayle, who squares off with Senator Al Gore next Tuesday, have both
been playing down expectations. Mr Quayle has been somewhat embarrassed by
his assertion that his modest state education in Indiana could not compare
with the smoothness that the Democratic vice-presidential candidate acquired
at expensive Washington private schools. He was forced to issue a home state
apology.
There is an unpredictability to the debates, particularly in the extent to
which over-coached candidates find themselves thrown off course by the
unexpected.
Apart from the inevitable round of television interviews, Mr Bush took most
of the day off yesterday, preparing for the debates, while Mr Clinton was
still out stumping in Florida and Mr Perot put the final touches to a
half-hour paid TV commercial last night. As is now customary, Mr Baker was
nowhere to be seen.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Mexican governor resigns

<TEXT>
MEXICO'S ruling party governor from Michoacan state has resigned, almost
certainly ending three months of opposition marches and protests, which
followed his controversial election in July, writes Damian Fraser in Mexico
City.
The resignation - formally a leave of absence for one year - comes as a blow
to President Carlos Salinas and the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
party. Both had invested considerable energy and authority in supporting
Governor Eduardo Villasenor.
Michoacan is the stronghold of the leftist Party of Democratic Revolution,
whose president, Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, was the former state governor. Its
candidate, Mr Cristobal Arias, lost the election by 16 percentage points in
a process marred by a considerable disparity in resources between the two
parties.

FT  07 OCT 92 / German industrial orders fall again

<TEXT>
THE LEVEL of industrial orders in west Germany fell in August for the sixth
month in succession, underlining the gloomy outlook for the German economy.
A slight improvement in unemployment figures for September, also published
yesterday, failed to reflect the normal seasonal upturn, while retail trade
figures showed a sharp drop in turnover in the past 12 months.
The level of manufacturing orders was down by 0.4 per cent in August
compared with the previous month, and 8.2 per cent lower than August 1991.
Taking the two months, July and August, orders were down 1.7 per cent
compared with May/June, reflecting a sharp drop of 2.9 per cent in export
orders, even before the latest sharp increase in the value of the D-Mark in
the currency markets.
The two-month total was down 6.7 per cent from July/August 1991. Although
export orders were virtually constant in August, according to the economics
ministry, there was a clear drop in orders for the vehicle manufacturing
industry, a reliable bell-wether for other sectors.
On the jobs front, the number of unemployed fell by 38,000 in west Germany
to 1.783m, although seasonally adjusted that amounts to an increase of some
20,000. Compared with September 1991, the number of jobless was up 174,000.
In east Germany, the unadjusted unemployment figure was also slightly down -
by 58,000 to 1.11m - but commentators are unanimous that the figure does not
reflect any reliable or lasting upturn in that economy.
Mr Heinrich Franke, president of the Federal Labour Office, said that the
figures from the west showed there was no sign of an end to the weakening
economy there.
The figures for the east did not suggest any sign of the hoped for upturn in
the labour market, although they did indicate that the low point of
unemployment might be reached by the end of the year or the beginning of
1993.
Figures for specialised retail trade showed a real 5 per cent drop in
turnover over the 12 months to August, according to the retail industry
association in Cologne. The slowdown was reflected in public protest
yesterday when more than 3,000 workers at Porsche sports car plants staged
demonstrations against the company's plan to cut 1,850 jobs in the current
year, according to the IG Metall union.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UN move on Yugoslav war crimes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UN Security Council last night voted unanimously to establish a
commission to investigate charges of mass killings and other war crimes,
including the campaign of so-called 'ethnic cleansing', in former
Yugoslavia.
The resolution is directed particularly at Serb actions in
Bosnia-Hercegovina and could lead to trials by an international tribunal, as
recommended in a UN human rights report.
However, no immediate provision for this has been made, prompting Mr Muhamed
Sacirbey, the Bosnian delegate, to criticise the resolution for not going
far enough. Other delegates, however, saw the action as the start of a
process to bring to justice what one called those responsible for 'blind
slaughter and barbarism'.
The human rights group, Helsinki Watch, the Conference on Security
Co-operation in Europe and other sources have reported serious violations,
including mass executions, in Serb-run concentration camps in Bosnia.
In a related action yesterday, the Security Council authorised UN troops to
assume responsibility for demilitarising the Preklava peninsula on the
Adriatic sea, by removing heavy weapons from neighbouring areas of Croatia
and Montenegro and to ensure control of the Peruca Dam, which ethnic Serb
forces consider to be under their command.
Later today or tomorrow, the council is expected to turn to yet another
resolution, establishing a no-fly zone for combat aircraft in Bosnia - but
without any immediate provision for enforcement.
That could come in a later council decision, but probably not until the UN
force has been greatly strengthened by the addition of some 5,000 European
and Canadian troops.
In Geneva yesterday, Bosnia's rebel Serb faction said it was prepared to
suspend all its military flights over the country in a move which would make
a no-fly zone unnecessary. If the no-fly zone went ahead, the militant Serbs
said they would walk out of the Geneva peace talks.
While the US favoured using fighter aircraft to enforce a no-fly order
against the Serbs, Britain and France feared this could place UN
peace-keepers at grave risk as they escorted humanitarian aid convoys.
Air and land convoys to Bosnia are meeting less than one-third of the urgent
food needs there, the UN refugee agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Geneva.
'We are not short of food. What we are short of is an ability to deliver
it,' said Ms Sylvana Foa, for the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees. A minimum of 6,000 metric tonnes of food were needed every week in
Bosnia, she said. But the present capacity fell far short of this target,
leaving relief workers unable to even begin a programme to prepare for
winter.

ABKHAZIAN separatists and their allies have secured the whole of
north-western Abkhazia in a bloody setback for the Georgian leader, Mr
Eduard Shevardnadze, just five days before general elections, Reuter reports
from Moscow.
Last night Georgia requested an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council on
the conflict and asked for the despatch of UN observers. Mr Boutros Boutros
Ghali, the secretary-general, is shortly to report on the situation to the
council.
Georgian troops were swept from their last two villages near the Russian
border on Monday night, suffering hundreds of casualties. Some were
evacuated by the Black Sea, others fled inland into the mountains, and at
least 200 crossed into Russia and were interned, Itar-Tass news agency said.
Following the capture of Gagra on Friday, the rebels now control the entire
100km stretch from the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi, to the Russian border.
In Moscow, President Boris Yeltsin, main guarantor of an abortive Abkhazia
ceasefire agreed last month, told parliament Russian troops were taking over
the Abkhazia section of the Moscow-Tbilisi railway.

<TEXT>
MR Arkady Volsky, leader of Russia's conservative industrial lobby,
yesterday launched a rearguard attack against the Russian reformist cabinet
from the region historically viewed as the crown jewel of the Russian
empire, Ukraine.
Speaking to a conference of Ukrainian, Russian and east European factory
directors in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, Mr Volsky expressed satisfaction
at the speech made in Moscow by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
The leader of Civic Union told Ukrainian factory directors: 'It is pleasant
that Mr Yeltsin echoed our views.' But he warned that he and his
increasingly powerful lobby would not be appeased by a single speech.
He said his group had an alternative economic reform programme and that if
this was not adopted by the government he would lead Russia's factory
directors into open opposition.
'We need to call a time out on reform,' Mr Volsky said. 'We should not take
a step backwards but for now must jog in one spot.'
Mr Volsky said he favours using China and South Korea as models rather than
the western market economies Mr Gaidar seeks to emulate.
Mr Volsky's choice of Kiev as a venue for these remarks is part of a wider
campaign by Russian conservatives to play the Ukrainian card in an effort to
force Mr Yeltsin to back down from radical reform.
Last month's agreement between the Ukrainian and Russian central banks,
lambasted by Russian reformers as opening a back door to inflationary
policies, is another example of this tactic.
'The basic question is the harmonisation of reform programmes of the
republics of the former Soviet Union,' Mr Volsky said.
Mr Volsky would clearly like to 'harmonise' Russia's approach with that of
Ukraine, whose state-dominated economic programme corresponds with his own
preferences.
The only bone of contention between Mr Volsky and Mr Vasyl Evtukhov, his
Ukrainian counterpart, was the sensitive national issue of Ukraine's plan to
introduce a separate currency.
Mr Evtukhov advocated Ukraine's exit from the rouble zone. However, Mr
Volsky said that members of the Commonwealth of Independent States should
stick to a single currency.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BORIS YELTSIN, the Russian president, yesterday abandoned outright
support for his cabinet, admitting they had made mistakes and that the
sacrifices of the Russian people had been greater than needed.
'Corrections must be made in the reforms. This is a demand from the
president,' he told Russian deputies.
He also made overtures to the centrist industrialists' faction, Civic Union,
which wants slower reform and industrial subsidies retained.
The effect of Mr Yeltsin's speech was to put him above the political fray,
in a position where he can choose between competing programmes - and where
his support for the cabinet of Mr Yegor Gaidar is now much more measured.
He chided the 'Gaidar team' for rejecting all ideas not their own and
advised them to take note of the proposals of Civic Union, led by Mr Arkady
Volsky.
Mr Yeltsin singled out two of Mr Gaidar's closest allies - Mr Peter Aven,
minister for foreign economic affairs, and Mr Andrei Nechayev, minister for
the economy, blaming them for inefficiency.
He followed that with the lukewarm observation that this was not a cause for
the resignation of the government and that 'another government would have
been worse'.
The fate of Mr Aven and Mr Nechayev was uncertain last night, though the
rumour mill had already marked the latter down for the ambassadorship to
Austria.
Mr Volsky, said Mr Yeltsin had shown support for his programme and warned
that if the government did not accept it, his powerful Civic Union bloc
would go into full opposition.
Mr Gaidar, speaking after Mr Yeltsin, claimed there was no alternative to
his programme and produced a detailed critique of the industrialists'
proposals, saying that the 'Chinese model' of controlled reform from the top
endorsed by Mr Volsky and his colleagues was not an option for Russia.
That model, he reminded the deputies, was one where opposition was
suppressed and division of powers unknown.
On specific measures, the president said that:
The rouble - which plunged again against the dollar yesterday from 309 to
342 - should be 'the only means of payment in Russia'.
He proposed banning the use of foreign currencies to pay for goods and
services, a measure which would directly oppose the trend to the use of hard
currencies by foreign and Russian companies.
A 'real' rouble rate against the dollar must be achieved by widening trading
of the rouble. Exporters would be made to sell all of their hard currency
receipts for roubles at the market exchange rate - a measure sure to be
unpopular with Russia's hard pressed export industries.
He had already signed a decree allowing citizens to use their privatisation
vouchers to buy land, houses and municipal property (shops and small
businesses), as well as shares in large companies for which the vouchers
were originally designed.
He had also signed a decree setting up a system of land banks to encourage
the growth of private farming.
General Alexander Rutskoi, the influential vice-president, had been put in
charge of a special commission to root out corruption. This is widely seen
as a high profile job which appears to recognise the vice-president's
growing political influence.

The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe adopted a proposal
yesterday to make recourse to the European Court of Human Rights quicker,
Reuter reports from Strasbourg.
At present, a group or individual taking a case to the Court goes through
the European Commission on Human Rights, which weighs whether cases should
be referred to the Court and rejects some 90 per cent of them.
The proposal by the parliamentary assembly, which would have to be approved
by foreign ministers from the 27 member states of the Council, suggests
dropping the Commission so that cases would go direct to the Court and be
filtered there.

FRANCE'S economic slowdown was yesterday confirmed by a rise in gross

per cent in the first three months, writes David Buchan from Paris.
The only bright spot in the April-June picture was provided by the trade
balance, which improved because of a drop in imports. The depressing state
of the domestic economy was underlined by a 0.2 per cent drop in consumption
which had risen by 0.4 per cent in the first quarter, even though salaries
and social security payments grew.

SWEDEN'S government will not be deflected from its free market strategy by
current economic difficulties, Mr Carl Bildt, the prime minister, said
yesterday at the opening of parliament.
Mr Bildt's centre-right coalition will press ahead with free market reforms
in its next 12 months in power, Mr Bildt said.
The prime minister's determination is in spite of the historic compromise he
made with the Social Democratic opposition in negotiating two all-party
crisis packages of spending cuts and tax increases.
The government promised to eliminate the country's growing structural budget
deficit as part of its measures to shore up the krona, stimulate
competitiveness and calm the markets.
Mr Bildt said legislation in the next parliamentary session would transform
Sweden into a more entreprenurial, dynamic country. His pledges indicate the
government wants to stick to its long-term strategy of preparing Sweden for
European Community membership in 1995 and economic and monetary union.
This autumn's measures include:
A bill to enable the supply of venture capital particularly to new
enterprises through a risk capital company.
The deregulation of Swedish railways, the telecommunications system and the
postal services by turning the public enterprises into limited companies.
The government is to abolish the state monopoly on labour market
institutions, allowing private employment agencies. It will turn the public
training board into a limited company.
'New and tougher competition' laws are to introduced to increase competition
in public procurement by local authorities.
The prime minister also confirmed that there would be a moratorium on the
sale of Sweden's state enterprises because of the 'current market
situation'. However, he said preparations for privatisation would continue.
He also announced a measure to underpin the country's banking system with
state guarantees. Mr Bildt also unveiled sweeping changes in Sweden's social
policy.
A family doctor system would be introduced to operate initially alongside
community health centres. The state pensionable retirement age is to be
extended from 65 to 66 from January 1 1994.
The government wants to introduce dental care charges from the same date. It
is examining a system of mandatory health insurance to shift the cost of
medical care from the state by the mid-1990s.
Meanwhile, the Confederation of Swedish Industries reported this week it
expects a decline of 1.8 per cent both this year and in 1993 in the
country's gross national product and a rise in unemployment to 7 per cent
from around 5 per cent now.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Dutch disaster a grim reminder of risks to insurers:
Difficult negotiations are in prospect, over the setting of new rates in a
competitive market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEVASTATION of apartment blocks on Amsterdam's Bijlmermeer estate is a
grim reminder to aviation insurers of the potential risks to which they are
exposed.
It forms a grisly backdrop to the round of negotiations under way between
insurers and brokers acting on behalf of the world's airlines, 75 per cent
of which renew their insurance programmes in October or November.
Following last week's loss of a Pakistan International Airlines A-300 in
Nepal, Sunday's crash of the El Al cargo aircraft is the latest in a series
of losses this year that could make 1992 one of the worst ever for aviation
insurers.
The hull of the El Al aircraft which pitched into the Bijlmermeer estate was
insured for Dollars 62m (Pounds 34.80m). But the cost of clearing the
debris, lost cargo and compensating relatives of victims may increase the
overall claim to more than Dollars 100m.
Mr John Westcott, underwriter with Wren syndicate 800 at Lloyd's and
chairman of the Lloyd's Aviation Underwriters Association, says that the
final reckoning might even reach Dollars 300m: 'Who knows what the liability
will end up as. We are certainly looking at Dollars 200m.'
For 1992 as a whole, London underwriters and brokers say overall claims from
hull damage, day-to-day minor accidents and liability awards could exceed
Dollars 1bn, the highest since 1985. That would put further pressure on
insurers to increase premium rates, which, after six years of intense
competition, are only about 50 per cent of 1986 levels.
However, world overcapacity continues to depress rates and reduce the scope
for increases. Willis Corroon Aerospace, the world's largest aviation
insurance broker, says that there remains more than twice the capacity as
needed, despite the departure from the market of companies such as Orion,
the subsidiary of the Dutch insurance giant, Internationale Nederlanden.
Underwriters at Lloyd's of London imposed rate increases last year of
between 100 and 200 per cent, but market leaders have been forced to abandon
this year's plans for similar rises. Brokers cite as a reason the threat of
further competition from insurers in Europe and the US.
'Over the last 12 months there has been a gradual weakening of the markets'
ability to restore profitability,' Willis said in a note to clients.
'Competitive forces have prevented underwriters from raising rating
thresholds.'
Insurers renewing policies on the first of October achieved average rate
rises of only around 10 per cent. Some European airlines with good safety
records, whose business is particularly sought after, escaped without any
increases. Two Asian airlines, both of which suffered losses in the previous
12 months, paid increases of between 20 and 40 per cent.
Mr Westcott criticises the attitude of some of his fellow underwriters as
'totally irresponsible,' saying that 'a lot of people are not aware of the
disparity between premiums and claims.' Many companies, especially outside
the London market, had seen aviation insurance as a high-profile
loss-leader. Referring to potential losses from liability claims (paid to
meet court awards to victims or relatives), he says that many underwriters
have 'not recognised the full extent of the losses that are in the
pipeline.'
The death toll from aviation accidents has mounted, especially recently,
with the casualty list including the more-than-250 people killed in Sunday's
disaster, the 167 in the PIA disaster, the 113 in August's Nigerian air
crash and the 116 in the crash of a Thai Airways A-310 in July.
The level of court awards is also rising sharply, especially in the US,
where insurers expect the average wrongful death to produce a claim of
Dollars 1.7m. Mr Westcott says that one US air accident victim was recently
awarded Dollars 25m.
In London, the recent losses will increase the pressure for further rate
increases and could lead to tough negotiations for airlines renewing their
programmes on the first of November.
'The PIA and El Al disasters are further reminders to people that losses are
mounting,' Mr Westcott says. 'You can't keep selling a two dollar bill for a
dollar. Some insurers will be losing an awful lot of money by the time the
day of reckoning comes.'

Hundreds of Serbs and Montenegrins yesterday protested against the
withdrawal of the Yugoslav navy from Prevlaka, Croatia's southern Adriatic
peninsula, agreed by the presidents of Croatia and the rump Yugoslavia in
Geneva last week, writes Laura Silber in Belgrade.
Prevlaka is due to become a demilitarised zone. The UN Security Council was
due last night to adopt a resolution empowering UN soldiers to monitor it
and to ensure the removal of heavy weapons from neighbouring areas of
Croatia and Montenegro, in co-operation, as appropriate, with EC monitors.
The protesters said the withdrawal would pave the way for a Croatian
offensive on Serb-held regions in neighbouring southern Bosnia and in
Montenegro, which with Serbia makes up the unrecognised Yugoslav federation.
The protest appeared to be backed by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.

<TEXT>
BARCLAYS Bank shares attracted exceptionally heavy two-way trading activity
after Credit Lyonnais Laing, the French-owned stockbroker, was said to have
trimmed its dividend forecasts for the bank.
The stockbroker declined to give details of any forecast reduction but said
it felt Barclays would be prudent to consider a cut in the payment in order
to protect its capital ratios. Dealers in the market said that a large line
of Barclays stock, rumoured to have been as large as six to seven million
shares, had been offered around the market.
Barclays shares fell to 325p at one point, but later rallied to end the
session a net 4 higher at 335p on turner of 13 million.
Grand Met busy
Brewery and food group Grand Metropolitan recorded its largest share
turnover for five years as some investors decided that the recent bleak
trading had now been discounted and that the shares looked cheap. The stock
climbed 19 1/2 to 379 1/2 , the best performing FT-SE stock, in huge
turnover of 18m. Grand Met has been dogged by poor trading news,
particularly in its US food operations, in recent months, which led to two
sets of brokers' downgrades last month. These prompted institutional
investors to bale out, bringing a steep slide in the share price.
However, Strauss Turnbull was prominent among a number of brokers and
institutions yesterday to recommend the stock. Strauss analyst Ms Alex
Oldroyd said: 'While the size of the problems in the US are unclear and
remain a cloud on the horizon, the fundamentals of the company remain sound
and at this price the shares look cheap.' Other analysts pointed to currency
considerations likely to benefit Grand Met and to the fact that the shares
underperformed by some 17 per cent last month.
Owners approached
Holiday group Owners Abroad finally bowed to market pressure and admitted in
a statement after another day's hectic trading that it had been approached
by a predator, although no formal offer had been made. The group's shares
rose a further 6 to 77p yesterday, a rise of 31 on their low-point of 46p
just three weeks ago. Market sources said that the group had been forced by
the Stock Exchange authorities to make the announcement in order to clarify
the situation.
The confirmation by Owners, Britain's second largest tour operator, fuelled
speculation, already rife, over who the predator might be. While some in the
market were suggesting LTU, the German airline group, others were pointing
nearer home, to Airtours, one of Owners main rivals. Neither company would
comment on the speculation last night. Airtours shares added 6 to 246p.
Standard Chartered jumped 23 to 445p, boosted by a profits upgrading
instigated by BZW. The broker was said to have lifted its current year
estimate from Pounds 210m to Pounds 225m and that for next year from Pounds
325m to Pounds 345m.
In composite insurances, General Accident recouped 19 to 504p and Sun
Alliance 12 to 285p.
The recent bout of outperformance by Shell Transport, which took the shares
close to their all time high relative to the market, came to a halt. The
shares fell 3 1/2 to 531p on 3.7m traded, ahead of a presentation to oil
analysts today by a senior executive from Shell's chemicals division.
Dealers said some institutions, mindful of the profits warning issued
recently by ICI, had decided to lock in profits in Shell.
The rest of the oil sector performed strongly. BP, benefiting from switching
from Shell, rose 4 1/2 to 215 1/2 p on 8m traded.
The forthcoming US listing and expected good news from the current series of
presentations to US institutions continued to produce a stream of buying
orders for Enterprise Oil.
But the main thrust behind yesterday's rise of 7 to 415p came from a buy
recommendation issued by Kleinwort Benson. The broker said Enterprise offers
'secure growth and income'. It added that Enterprise is 'fundamentally
strong with proven and probable reserves of 948m barrels of oil and has a
portfolio of assets encompassing North West Europe, Italy, the Black Sea,
and the Far East.
It spoke of a production profile rising sharply, a cash flow multiple of
below four times in the mid-1990s, and reduced gearing after the completion
of the ADR issue.
East Midland Electricity, rumoured to be interested in British Coal, edged
up 2 to 376p.
Electronic Data shares shot up 50 to 465p after an agency cross of 45,000
shares transacted at 475p.
Prudential Group shares moved erratically. They opened firmer in line with
the market but came under sustained pressure during early trading after news
that the company's Mercantile &amp; General (M &amp; G) subsidiary estimated its
losses resulting from hurricanes Andrew and Iniki at around Pounds 30m.
Dealers were also initially concerned at news that M &amp; G was taking strong
action to remedy the problems at its reinsurance business.
But two presentations by the insurance group, the first to insurance
analysts and the second to institutions, detailing moves by M &amp; G to adopt a
tough line of renewals and cut expenses, was well received and saw
Prudential shares stabilise and then move ahead strongly. They ended a busy
session a net 9 higher at 259p.
Sustained selling pressure sent shares in Rank Organisation tumbling in a
thin market. Dealers said the afternoon fall came after one leading house
was left with some stock on its books after matching a large buyer and
seller. They closed 20 off at 515p with just 370,000 traded.
Shares in Babcock International fell sharply, giving up 9 to 31 1/2 p, to
make it the day's worst performing stock in percentage terms, after a couple
of brokers downgraded profit expectations and provoked doubts about the
dividend. Smith New Court reduced its current year estimate by Pounds 10m to
Pounds 40m while Panmure Gordon reduced its figure by Pounds 8m to Pounds
42m.
Profit taking in British Aerospace led the shares to buck the market trend.
They ended 4 lighter at 131p.
The latest bid speculation in the engineering sector focused around Lucas
Industries, considered one of the great names in British engineering. The
suggestion was that engineering group Siebe could launch a bid for the
engineering and motor components group. Speculation sent Lucas shares
climbing 6 to 92p. Siebe hardened 2 to 337p with a further advance checked
by the bid talk and availability of stock.

FT  07 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rally in equities helped by sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARP rebound in sterling in Far Eastern markets overnight enabled the
UK stock market to outpace the recovery in other European equities
yesterday. Trading volume was unimpressive, however, and confidence remained
fragile as the stock market awaited a government statement on economic
strategy, perhaps at the annual conference of the governing Conservative
party which is now in session in Brighton.
The market made a strong start as sterling rose to DM2.4548, compared with
around DM2.3700 at Monday's low point. London was also encouraged by Wall
Street's success in rallying overnight to a close of minus 21.6 on the Dow,
a great relief after the 100 Dow loss showing as London closed on Monday.
Equities advanced rapidly yesterday morning and the FT-SE Index had gained
more than 41 points by mid-session. Traders identified some genuine
institutional demand for shares, and there were substantial gains in some of
the banking and retail stocks which suffered heavily in Monday's shakeout.
Investors backed away nervously when Wall Street opened lower, but London
regained its confidence as the Dow rallied to show a loss of a mere 1.89
points in UK hours. The final reading showed the Footsie at the day's peak
of 2,488.4, a recovery of 42.1 points.
Seaq volume of 467.1m shares compared with 477.6m in the previous session;
Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that retail business fell to Pounds 885m
on Monday, barely half that of recent sessions, confirming that the big
institutions played little role in the day's 4 per cent collapse in the
equity market.
Activity focused around selected situations, with bid features attracting
attention again, although confirmation of a bid approach at Owners Abroad
did not come until after the market closed.
Signs of a transatlantic two-way pull in Ranks Hovis McDougall appeared, as
some UK institutions took profits but US arbitrageurs, confident that Hanson
Group will increase the offer terms, continued to buy the shares.
There were US buyers also for Glaxo, which has underperformed since the
London market turned higher after sterling's withdrawal from the ERM system.
BAT Industries, another transatlantic favourite, moved up sharply.
Traders were wary of exaggerating yesterday's recovery, which still leaves
the Footsie with a gain of around only 5 per cent since Black Wednesday,
less than half of the gain recorded in the market's immediate response to
the government's decision to quit the ERM.
Although hopes for another cut in domestic base rates are now on hold, some
UK strategists believe US rates could be cut again later this week.
But investment confidence is still significantly restrained by uncertainty
over official policies towards sterling and interest rates. The market will
focus on tomorrow's speech at the Conservative party conference by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor of the exchequer.

FT  07 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEALERS in the derivatives reported a dull but volatile session which saw
turnover return to more modest levels, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the December Footsie contract opened strongly at
2,495 following the sizeable overnight bounce on Wall Street, the improved
performance of sterling and a squeeze as several dealers moved to cover
short positions. After a brief reversal which followed a bout of profit
taking, the contract traded in a narrow range of 2,500 and 2,520 for the
next few hours with traders seeing 2,510 as a selling opportunity.
The poor opening on Wall Street led to a sharp decline in December in the
afternoon when the contract fell to 2,487, the low point of the day before
bargain hunting helped steady nerves and led to a recovery, though this was
curtailed by a large selling order at the close in which traders continued
to deal in after hours trading.
December closed at 2,511, up 51 on Monday's poor close but around 6 points
below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 32. Turnover was a
meagre 7,300 contracts.
Turnover in traded options reached a poor 24,629, down sharply on Monday's
total of 40,670 lots. Some 8,723 lots were dealt in the FT-SE 100 options
contract, while Amstrad was the busiest stock option at 2,140 trades.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Interest cut aids Derwent Valley
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After reduced interest pay-able, Derwent Valley Holdings, the property
group, raised pre-tax profit from Pounds 425,000 to Pounds 603,000 in the
first half of 1992.
Despite the loss of income from the sale of a property in the second half of
1991 and a refurbishment, gross income remained virtually unchanged at
Pounds 3.82m (Pounds 3.81m).
Future opportunities for improvement of the port-folio had been pursued
des-pite the conditions in the market.
Interest charges this time were Pounds 1.58m (Pounds 1.75m). Earnings per
share came to 5.2p (3p) and the interim dividend is again 2.9p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Delaney Group, the furniture maker and shopfitter, reported a reduced
pre-tax loss of Pounds 495,000 on sales of Pounds 12m in the six months to
end-June.
The outcome compared with a loss of Pounds 646,000 from turnover of Pounds
11.2m last time and was struck after a lower interest charge of Pounds
137,000 (Pounds 186,000).
Losses per share were reduced to 0.9p (1.2p). The shares were unchanged at 6
1/2 p.
On prospects, Mr Nathu Puri, chairman, said it was difficult to foresee any
res-pite from the repressed mar-ket conditions. In fact the economy was
displaying distinct signs of further deterioration.
Uncertainty about government intentions had turned decision-making into
something of a lottery, he said.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Austrian group moves into Bullers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Control of Bullers, the maker of giftware and decorative accessories, is
expected to change under a series of arrangements announced yesterday.
Gamlestaden, which holds 48.24 per cent of the company has granted an option
to Auric Holdings of Austria on a 29.99 per cent holding. It has also
accepted the conversion of a Pounds 350,000 loan to Bullers into 35m
preference shares and given Auric the right to buy them at any time over the
next three years.
Auric will have the right to convert the preference shares on a 5-for-2
basis at any time.
If Auric exercises its rights in full it will control 58.9 per cent of
Bullers. The Takeover Panel has waived the requirement to make a full bid
should shareholders, other than Gamlestaden, approve the moves.
Marmara Bank, a Turkish bank, of which Mr Atilla Uras, owner of Auric, is
chairman, has provided an unsecured loan facility of Pounds 550,000 to
Bullers.
Mr Peter McBride, Auric's representative, has been appointed managing
director of Bullers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
QS HOLDINGS, the specialist retailer of value for money clothing, held its
competitive trading advantage to raise turnover 14 per cent to Pounds 23.2m
in the half year ended July 31.
This fed through to pre-tax profits in a near 7 per cent rise, from Pounds
3.6m to Pounds 3.86m. Earnings per share were 6.57p (6.07p) and the interim
dividend is pushed up to 1.56p (1.45p).
The group operates from 78 stores in the south of England, predominantly
selling women's and children's wear, and a selection of mens wear.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Owners Abroad reveals potential bid
approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER, Leisure Industries Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS ABROAD, the UK's second largest tour operator, said yesterday it had
received a tentative approach several weeks ago from a potential purchaser.
The company would not discuss the identity of the potential bidder, but it
is thought to be Airtours, the third largest tour operator. Airtours said it
could not confirm or deny it had made the approach.
Owners Abroad said discussions had not progressed beyond the tentative
contact. 'That approach has not been turned into a proposal, but it's not to
say that it won't'
The announcement came after the close of market trading yesterday. Its
shares had risen 6p to close at 77p, valuing the company at Pounds 113m.
Airtours shares, which had fallen 13p on Monday on rumours that it was
considering a bid for Owners Abroad, recovered 6p yesterday to close at
246p, for a market capitalisation of Pounds 231m.
Talk of a merger of the UK's second and third largest tour operators, comes
towards the end of a summer holiday season which has so far seen the
collapse of 52 members of the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta).
Although the industry reported that bookings had been healthy in recent
weeks, travel companies had, earlier in the year, suffered from
over-capacity and price-cutting.
Airtours has shown signs of wanting to tighten its grip on the travel
market. Last month it bought Pickfords Travel, the third largest chain of
travel agents from NFC, the transport company, for Pounds 16m.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours chairman, said owning Pickfords would enable
his company to improve the distribution of its holidays, particularly in the
south of England. He said that if each of Pickfords' 333 branches booked one
additional Airtours holiday a week, it would add Pounds 2m to the enlarged
group's pre-tax profits.
Thomson, the biggest tour operator, has owned Lunn Poly, the biggest chain
of travel agents, for 20 years.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Low take-up for Aegis rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS, the media-buying company, announced yesterday that just 14.4 per cent
of its Pounds 19.8m September rights issue had been taken up, and almost all
of that by Warburg Pincus, the US investment bank which had fully
underwritten it.
'We are not surprised that the take-up from institutions has been very low,
given the current market conditions and the pricing of the issue; any issue
priced at 55p against a stock price of 16p is not likely to go forward very
well,' the group said. The shares traded at a peak of 215p in October 1991.
In voting right terms there are now 200m shares in issue; 30 per cent are
held by SFEC, a company controlled by Mr Gilbert Gross, honorary president
of Aegis; 30 per cent by Warburg Pincus; 6 per cent by Eurocom; and the rest
by various financial institutions including Fidelity and Philips and Drew.
The two principal shareholders each have two representatives on the board.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: New board at Crown company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRENCH commercial court yesterday appointed a 'provisional director' to
supervise the setting up of a new board of RFM, the French commercial radio
network controlled by Crown Communications, the UK radio group.
The decision follows the resignation of several RFM directors. The
court-appointed director can also look at the financial viability of the
loss-making network and its precise shareholdings.
The court decision is a further embarrassment to Crown, owners of the London
Broadcasting Company, which reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 5.58m in the
six months to the end of March.
Mr Christopher Chataway, chairman of Crown, the USM-quoted commercial radio
group, however, yesterday dismissed the incident as 'a storm in a teacup at
a minor subsidiary.' Crown had not known about the hearing.
Crown is planning to sell the 114-station RFM network, which recently had
its Paris licence renewed, to a consortium led by NRJ, an independent French
radio network. Mr Chataway said yesterday he expected the sale to be
complete by the end of the year.
'RFM is being supported by Crown and this (the court decision) has
absolutely nothing to do with the financial viability of the company.'
The Crown chairman said the group had the continued support of its bankers
for the policy of stripping the company down to LBC, the London commercial
station which he said was cash positive.
The running of Independent Radio News had been taken over by Independent
Television News and talks, Mr Chataway said, were at an advanced stage on
the sale of IRS, the radio sales company.
In January the CSA gave approval for a change of shareholding at RFM which
would have meant Crown having 49 per cent, the management 21 per cent and a
French bank Credit Mutuel d'Artois 30 per cent.
Mr Chataway conceded yesterday that the management shareholding had not been
implemented and probably would not now be implemented because of the pending
sale.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Raine falls sharply to Pounds 13.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of Raine Industries, which earlier this year acquired
struggling housebuilder Walter Lawrence for Pounds 28.5m, fell by third to
Pounds 13.49m during the 12 months to the end of the June.
Despite the sharp fall Raine stood by its promise to pay a maintained final
dividend made in March when it acquired Walter Lawrence and separately
raised Pounds 33.5m from shareholders in a 2-for-7 rights issue.
Mr Peter Parkin, chief executive, said that Lawrence had made a Pounds
500,000 loss in the three months to the end of June but was now back in the
black and was expected to make a healthy contribution to profits in the
current year.
Shareholders will receive a 4p final dividend making a 6p (5.9p) total for
the year, just covered by earnings of 6.1p (10.3p).
Mr Parkin, who becomes executive chairman in November, said that an increase
in group turnover from Pounds 352.1m to Pounds 363.6m was due entirely to
the first-time contribution from Walter Lawrence.
The acquisition was bedding down well. Raine's housing land bank, of 5,865
plots, now had an average purchase price of Pounds 11,400 - equivalent to 17
per cent of the average sales price of Pounds 68,200 of one of the group's
homes.
Mr Parkin said few other housebuilders would be able to boast such a low
land cost to sales ratio. Even so, group profits from housebuilding fell
from Pounds 10.2m to Pounds 7.3m.
He added that there was still no sign of any pick-up in the UK housing
market despite the lowering of mortgage interest rates.
Contracting profits fell from Pounds 6.68m to Pounds 4.48m but this was
after a Pounds 1.7m loss from commercial property operations. Construction
of social housing rose by 31 per cent to 670 units which helped restrict the
fall in contracting profits.
More disappointing were the results from the Plumb's interiors contracting
business where profits fell from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 1.3m. The division
would have made a Pounds 500,000 loss but for the contribution from Raine's
70 per cent owned German subsidiary.
Group borrowings remain tightly under control with net debt of Pounds 40.8m
 -excluding non-recourse, off- balance sheet debt of Pounds 11.8m -
equivalent to gearing of just over 34 per cent.
COMMENT
Raine possesses some quality businesses even if the sector in which they
operate is having a disastrous time. Low land costs, helped by the Walter
Lawrence acquisition, leave the group well placed to take advantage of a
recovery (if any) in the housing market. Disposals and savings arising from
the acquisition could generate Pounds 10m to Pounds 15m of cash in the
current year reducing gearing to about 25 per cent. Contracting is under
pressure but still delivered margins of just over 3 per cent, excluding
property losses. This is better than many other contractors can boast. Plumb
is having a hard time of it but like housing should be one of the first to
benefit from recovery. If things go wrong Raine can always sell the US
housing business acquired along with Walter Lawrence. Pre-tax profits of
Pounds 17.5m, giving same-again earnings and total dividend of 6p, would put
the shares on a prospective pe of 14 and yield of 10.6 per cent. It is one
of the very few buys in the sector.

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Cost-cutting behind 30% rise to Pounds 6.6m
at Barry Wehmiller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARRY WEHMILLER Internat-ional, the specialist packaging equipment group,
reported a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to July 31
on the back of a cost-cutting programme.
Profits worked through at Pounds 6.55m (Pounds 5.03m) on slightly reduced
sales of Pounds 73.7m (Pounds 75.4m).
Net cash stood at Pounds 4.9m, achieved after last year's Pounds 12.9m
rights issue combined with an 18 per cent reduction in inventory levels and
strict control of costs and working capital.
Interest received of Pounds 133,000 compared with Pounds 1.1m payable.
As part of the cost-cutting exercise the number of employees was cut by 199
to 1,222.
The vision division, which scans bottles and packages, turned a Pounds 1.63m
operating loss into a profit of Pounds 670,000 by sorting out technical
problems associated with the launch of a new product.
The new management at the division made significant reductions in the level
of stock.
A reduction in demand from UK customers affected both food equipment, where
operating profits fell from Pounds 4.2m to Pounds 3.5m, and general
packaging, with operating profits down from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 2.3m.
Almost 70 per cent of the group's turnover is generated overseas. While
sales in the UK fell to Pounds 22.5m (Pounds 28.4m) they increased to Pounds
20.8m (Pounds 16.1m) in the US.
The group reported a recovery in demand from the US market which helped the
food equipment division partly offset the adverse economic conditions in the
UK.
Earnings per share rose to 10.7p (9.8p). The final dividend is again 4.3p
making a maintained total of 6.7p on the increased capital.
Mr Nigel McLean, chairman, is to retire at the annual meeting in December in
favour of Mr Michael Windsor, deputy chairman. A new non-executive director
will be appointed.

LONDON &amp; Manchester, the life assurance group, has increased its interim
dividend by 5 per cent, from 4.428p to 4.65p, after announcing a 13 per cent
rise in premium income in the first half of 1992.
On an annualised basis home service division premiums increased by 14 per
cent and pensions rose by 36 per cent, offsetting a 21 per cent fall in new
business generated by the company's life broker division.
Mr John Thomson, chairman, said the strong performance by the home service
division - the company's traditional sales force - demonstrated 'the
capacity of this mature but vigorous business to deliver sustained and
significant real expansion despite the severe recessionary climate.'
In the six months new annual premiums, however, fell to Pounds 23m, against
Pounds 25m. 1m and Pounds 50.4m for 1991 as a whole, while new single
premiums rose to Pounds 92.1m, compared with Pounds 33.2m and Pounds 11.6m
for the year. Overall premium income amounted to Pounds 174m (Pounds
115.1m).
New business generated by the life broker division fell 30 per cent to
Pounds 8.6m (Pounds 12.3m), but premiums earned by the home service ordinary
life rose to Pounds 4.6m (Pounds 4.2m). Home service industrial life annual
premiums increased to Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 4m) and pensions to Pounds 5.5m
(Pounds 4.6m).
The group also announced that provisions against losses on its mortgage
lending had been strengthened to reflect the continued weakness of the
residential property market.
Mr Thomson said that 'the impact of the prolonged and deep recession has
continued unabated' within the group's non-insurance property-related
businesses.
'The management of the virtually closed book of residential mortgage
business has been especially onerous, in the face of a housing market
characterised by continually falling values and moribund turnover levels.'

FT  07 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Savage Pounds 2m back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVAGE Group is reaping the rewards of its two-year reorganisation of
European businesses with a return to the black in the year to June 30.
Yesterday the USM-quoted hardware group announced pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.02m, against losses of Pounds 115,000 previously. It is also returning to
the dividend list with a 0.25p payment and expects that, if it is possible,
an interim will be paid for the current half-year.
Mr Doug Rogers, who became chairman in the wake of a shareholder revolt in
autumn 1990, said: 'We have reduced the company to a solid base from where
it can grow.' Pre-tax profits in continuing activities rose 57 per cent to
Pounds 2.23m (Pounds 1.42m).
When he arrived the balance of Savage's business was half UK and half
Europe. Now it was 75 per cent UK, 15 per cent Germany and 5 per cent each
for Benelux and the rest of the world.
Mr Rogers said that recent interest rate cuts and the fall in sterling
against other currencies reinforced the board's cautious optimism about the
UK performance in particular and the maintenance of the group's recovery in
general.
Total turnover fell to Pounds 73.5m (Pounds 123.9m), though in continuing
activities it rose 1 per cent to Pounds 69.4m (Pounds 68.8m). There were no
exceptional costs (Pounds 494,000) and total interest charges fell to Pounds
1.34m (Pounds 4.09m). There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 2.85m
(Pounds 5.13m). Earnings emerged at 0.9p (losses 5.4p).

FT  07 OCT 92 / Trafalgar plans strategy changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House, the property, con-struction and engineering group, fighting
a tender offer by Hongkong Land, yesterday signalled changes in strategy and
management in an attempt to stay independent.
Hongkong Land, which bought 14.99 per cent of the group last Thursday, has
until Friday afternoon to secure another 15 per cent by tender.
Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman, in a circular to shareholders said Hongkong
Land's offer of 85p a share is 'inadequate and seriously undervalues your
company'.
The letter says the group has been 'considering for some time management
succession plans for senior positions in the company'. This would be in
addition to the appointment of extra non-executive directors.
The performance of Sir Nigel and Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, has
recently been criticised by some of the group's institutional shareholders.
Sir Nigel confirmed yesterday that the group is trying to sell its UK
hotels, which include the Ritz and the Stafford, and has signed conditional
contracts for the sale of Cunard's two Caribbean resort hotels.
Trafalgar said it was also looking to get better value for its fleet of
seven ships, which includes the QE2, by merging the business with another
shipping operator.
The group's document reveals that three of the group's four main divisions
produced lower profits or a loss during the 12 months to the end of
September. Only the John Brown and Davy engineering companies increased
profits.
In the 'absence of unforeseen circumstances' the group says it will pay a
final dividend of 1.6p compared with a 9.6p final last year. This is higher
than some analysts had expected before Hongkong Land's approach.
The document reveals that the group's total borrowings at the end of
September were significantly lower than the group had previously indicated.
According to Sir Nigel, net debt including off-balance sheet borrowings was
Pounds 475m. This is equivalent to gearing of 67 per cent based on
shareholders' funds of Pounds 704.6m at the beginning of the year.
Shareholders' funds, however, are likely to have fallen as a result of
write-downs on commercial and residential property.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Hanson transmits mixed signals: Maggie Urry outlines the
confusing clash of styles which the RHM offer represents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The problem with Hanson is that it cannot behave in the 1990s the way it did
in the 1980s. That is how one shareholder of the Anglo-American conglomerate
characterises the challenge facing the group and its management.
If the 1980s was the era of swashbuckling takeover bids and shrewd
disposals, the 1990s may prove to be a period of fewer opportunities and
more nose-to-the-grindstone work in running the businesses it owns.
Hanson can no longer bid for companies as large as itself. When the results
for the financial year just ended are published in December, they will
confirm that the group's unbroken profit record has finally ended.
The Pounds 780m cash offer for Ranks Hovis McDougall, announced on Monday,
looks like a throw-back to 1980s Hanson style.
That adds to the apparent confusion surrounding the strategy which Hanson
proclaimed to analysts at a meeting in February. There was a feeling that
Hanson was stung into greater openness about its plans by the hostile
reaction when it took a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries
in May last year.
The strategy was described as concentrated on running and expanding the
group's core businesses and making disposals of some of the peripheral
activities. It was portrayed as a significant change of direction, if not by
the group itself, certainly by commentators. It was taken to mean that
Hanson was no longer a trader in assets, but an industrial group dedicated
to building and managing businesses which would remain with the company.
As such, one Hanson follower in the City insists the offer for RHM 'drives a
coach and horses through that strategy'. Others say that in any case they
had not believed the company had changed its spots.
The message coming from Hanson headquarters is that its fundamental aim of
enhancing shareholder value has never changed, and the offer for RHM follows
that strategy. Further, Hanson admits, the word 'core' was perhaps used
loosely, although it appeared again on Monday when RHM was offered the
chance to become 'a new core business to Hanson'.
Mr Derek Bonham, appointed this year as chief executive of the UK side of
the group, says 'core to us means a significant market sector which we think
is capable of responding to our management style'. It does not mean that
such a business will never be sold. Nor that the existing list of core
businesses cannot be extended.
Hanson must blame itself if outsiders do not understand what the company is
up to. For years, the group kept aloof from the City, giving shareholders
little information about the business, such as where profits came from.
Lord Hanson boasted an unbroken record of profits growth since he started
the business in 1963, and basked in the headlines about his latest daring
deal. That was enough, in the good times, to keep the share rating up.
That does not work when times are tougher. The shares began to underperform
the stock market in 1990 and the rating has slipped until the group's paper
is now too lowly valued to allow it to be used for a takeover bid without
diluting earnings.
What Hanson failed to do in the good times was to emphasise the management's
skills in turning around badly managed businesses and improving margins. Now
it says that, for example, profits at Imperial Tobacco, acquired in 1986,
have doubled in five years. However, until recently, such information was
hard to unearth from published statements.
Mr Bonham says: 'We cannot be seen to be serious managers of businesses if
we do not tell people what we are doing.' That signals the greater
disclosure in last year's accounts and in filings made in the US, including
a breakdown of profits by activity.
However, investors are still sometimes confronted by one-off profits; for
instance, that on the sale of the Newmont Mining stake which appeared in the
1991 figures. They are also bewildered by such intricacies as interest
received from cash balances held offshore and the use of acquisition
accounting. Investors would rather see a lower level of repeatable earnings
than higher profits from 'funnies'.
If Hanson did not give enough emphasis to its managerial skills in the
1980s, it has recently gone too far the other way, in making a hostile bid
such as that for RHM seem unlikely.
Mr Bonham says that in the 1980s it was enough to take opportunities on
behalf of its shareholders. In the 1990s, he believes, it is necessary to
make stronger overtures to the target company's board, as Hanson has done to
RHM.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Bids for Continental intensify
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK, STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE bidding battle for Continental Airlines, the fifth largest US carrier
that has been in bankruptcy since late-1990, intensified yesterday, as
Aeromexico, Mexico's largest airline, joined in. A few hours later, the Air
Canada investment group also increased its offer, by Dollars 25m to Dollars
425m (Pounds 248m).
These developments followed news late on Monday that Scandinavian Air
Systems, which has written off an earlier Dollars 106m investment in
Continental but still holds a 16.8 per cent equity stake, might also become
involved again.
Aeromexico's involvement comes in conjunction with the investment group put
together by a Houston-based financier, Mr Charles Hurwitz.
Mr Hurwitz's group opened the auction for Continental in July, offering to
infuse Dollars 350m into the bankrupt carrier for a 72 per cent equity
stake. However, only Dollars 25m of this would have come in the form of an
equity investment, with the rest from the sale of debt securities, backed by
Continental assets.
Yesterday's revised offer from the Hurwitz group, along with Aeromexico and
other Mexican investors, suggests a total investment of Dollars 400m. No
sooner had this offer been announced, than the Air Canada investment group
raised the total value of its offer by Dollars 25m to Dollars 425m.
Houston Air, Lufthansa and a group of former executives. have each declared
an interest in Continental.
A process for selecting a victorious bid for Continental has been agreed
with the bankruptcy court. Firm written offers must be received by November
2.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Chairmen meet and exchange views on bid
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairmen of Hanson and Ranks Hovis McDougall met yesterday and had 'a
useful exchange of views' regarding Hanson's Pounds 780m cash offer for the
food group, writes Maggie Urry.
The two sides agreed not to disclose any further details about the talks.
As well as Lord Hanson and Mr Stanley Metcalfe, the two chairmen, the
meeting was attended by Mr Tony Alexander, chief operating officer of the
conglomerate, and Sir Peter Reynolds, deputy chairman of RHM.
It is thought that the talks did not result in either an out-of-hand
dismissal of the offer or a discussion of a price which RHM could recommend
to its shareholders. Each side will consider the points made and further
talks are possible.
Lord Hanson had written to Mr Metcalfe on Monday, when he announced the
offer, inviting him to a meeting.
A brief statement from NM Rothschild, Hanson's merchant bank, said the two
chairmen 'were grateful for the opportunity to meet'.
RHM's share price dipped yesterday but recovered to close at 239p, down 2p
on the day, but still above the 220p a share offer. Hanson's shares rose 1p
to 203p.
Hanson also announced some further disposals of peripheral businesses in the
US. It has agreed the sale of Weber Aircraft of California, which makes
interior equipment for aircraft, for Dollars 85m (Pounds 49.5m), Dollars 37m
above book value. The purchaser is Air Cruisers, a US subsidiary of Groupe
Zodiac of France. Weber incurred an operating loss in the 1990-91 financial
year.
The lighting systems division of Halkey-Roberts and A&amp;S Building Systems
were also sold. The sale of Ranger Footwear was completed. Together, these
three were sold for Dollars 11m, compared with a book value of Dollars 8m,
and incurred an operating loss of Dollars 3m in 1990-91.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Russia's Aviastar looks to west for aircraft partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AVIASTAR, the large Russian aerospace manufacturer, is seeking to attract
western partners in an attempt to become one of the world's three biggest
commercial aircraft manufacturers.
The Russian group yesterday announced it had appointed Price Waterhouse, the
international accounting and management consulting firm, to help it sell a
stake of up to 50 per cent in the company. Assistance is also being sought
to develop a long-term strategic plan and to identify appropriate strategic
alliances with other aircraft makers.
Mr Viktor Mikhaylov, Aviastar's director-general, said yesterday the company
wanted to establish itself as the third largest commercial aircraft
manufacturer after the US Boeing and the European Airbus consortium during
the next 10 years. That would involve collaboration with western
manufacturers and the sale of equity to western partners.
Aviastar, which builds the Antonov AN124 cargo aircraft and the 200-seater
Tupolev TU 204 twin engine airliner, was formed last November as a
joint-stock company consisting of the former state-owned Ulyanovsk Aviation
industrial complex on the Volga river about 600 miles east of Moscow. Mr
Mikhaylov said the conversion of the group into a joint-stock company was
expected to be completed by the middle of next year.
Aviastar offered potential western partners in the US and Europe low labour
costs and considerable aerospace manufacturing expertise, he added.
The company employs about 36,000 people and the Ulyanovsk complex, in which
about Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.3bn) has been invested since 1974, is the most
modern aviation facility in Russia, Price Waterhouse said.
Aviastar has already started a series of collaborative ventures with western
companies, including a joint venture with Heavylift Airlines based in
Stansted in the UK to operate AN124 cargo aircraft in world markets.
Mr Mikhaylov said Aviastar expected to sign an agreement with the European
Airbus consortium next year to provide cargo air services for Airbus.

FT  07 OCT 92 / M&amp;G to seek rises in profit margins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCANTILE &amp; General Reinsurance, the subsidiary of Prudential Corporation
and the UK's biggest reinsurance company, is prepared to reduce its share of
the general reinsurance business if it is unable to obtain satisfactory rate
increases.
'If we fail to turn the market, we will turn away from it,' said Mr John
Engestrom, the chief executive who took office in July. 'In the light of
continuing losses and with minimal evidence of a significant hardening of
the market, we intend to adopt a tough stance on imminent renewals.'
With net premium income of about Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 780m) in 1991, M&amp;G is
the 10th largest reinsurer in the world, although some 65 per cent of
earnings are generated by life reinsurance.
Mr Engestrom accepted that the company's rating stance would lead to a sharp
reduction in market share next year. Rates from catastrophe reinsurance,
marine and aviation business - in which Lloyd's of London and London market
companies specialise - have increased, but elsewhere reinsurance rates were
not increasing by a sufficient margin to guarantee profitability, he said.
Softness in rates for proportional business - in which reinsurers insure a
fixed percentage of risks insured by direct insurers - reflected low rates
in direct business, both in North America and Europe. Markets in Germany,
Italy and elsewhere in Europe had been 'slow to react' to increases in
claims, said Mr Engestrom.
Mr Engestrom said that since the Prudential had published its interim
results last month 'there had been a deterioration in the company's general
business'.
Losses at the interim stage amounted to Pounds 25m, compared with Pounds 2m
at the same stage last year. Claims from hurricane Andrew, which hit the US
in late August, and hurricane Iniki, which devastated Hawaii last month,
amount to about Pounds 30m. M&amp;G announced last month that it expected claims
of some Pounds 20m.
The group expects further losses on its LMX retrocession business
underwritten between 1987 and 1990 - in which London market companies and
Lloyd's syndicates reinsure each other's catastrophe exposures. It is keen
to increase its share of the less volatile and more profitable life
reinsurance market.

pull-out
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, leader of South Africa's KwaZulu black
'homeland', yesterday threatened to secede from South Africa, further
raising the political temperature following his decision last week to pull
out of talks on a post-apartheid constitution.
In a speech at a meeting with two other homeland leaders and ultra-right
wing white political leaders,
Chief Buthelezi stressed that secession would be what he called 'the
ultimate extremity of political action'. But he added that such an extreme
action might be 'foisted' on him if negotiations failed.
His threat adds to the tension caused by the renewed crisis in negotiations,
with the Zulu leader issuing increasingly heated attacks on the African
National Congress (ANC) and the government, which he accuses of reaching
agreements which ignore the wishes of other parties to the negotiations.
Yesterday's meeting was called to discuss this complaint.
Chief Buthelezi and Mr Lucas Mangope, leader of the Bophuthatswana homeland,
both said they might pull out of negotiations permanently unless they and
other leaders were given more say.
Mr Mangope has made clear in the past that he prefers to remain outside a
post-apartheid South Africa, and would consider re-incorporation only if the
new South Africa is a federal state with very strong regional governments.
'We say no to any further appeasement of the ANC,' Chief Buthelezi told the
meeting.
The parties said they did not plan a formal alliance, but wanted to signal
to Mr F W de Klerk, the president, that they would work together to thwart
any further agreements between the ANC and Pretoria.
Over the past 10 days western diplomats have been pressuring government and
the ANC to take action to appease Chief Buthelezi and bring him back into
the negotiations.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The problems of growing up: As its economy matures, Taiwan
has to make the switch from low-cost to high-tech industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DECADE of growth at more than 8 per cent a year turned Taiwan into one of
the richest places in Asia. Helped by rising trade surpluses, the island's
central bank has accumulated foreign exchange reserves of Dollars 88bn, the
largest in the world. And, this year, despite the world recession, growth is
likely to reach 7 per cent and unemployment remain below 2 per cent.
However, growing wealth has led to new problems.
As the economy has matured, the pillars which supported rapid industrial
growth have been undermined. Strong, centralised government has had to make
way to popular calls for more democracy. Once low-cost manufacturing is no
longer competitive. And budgetary restraint has been overlooked as the
island embarks on a Dollars 306bn six-year National Development plan to
improve its infrastructure and quality of life. There is a consensus that
these policy changes were needed, but their implementation will decide
whether Taiwan can successfully move to the next stage of industrial
development.
Political reform, instigated by President Lee Teng-hui since 1987, has so
far been relatively smooth. In December Taiwan holds its first fully
representative election for the Legislative Yuan, or parliament. The ruling
Kuomintang party (KMT) is expected to win a comfortable majority. It has
been prepared to adopt populist platforms espoused by its poorly organised
opposition, the Democratic Progressive Party. KMT control of the media,
Taiwan's rising wages, low unemployment and a generally egalitarian
education system have helped stability.
But the greatest test for Taiwan lies in upgrading its industry. Since the
late 1980s rising land costs and annual wage increases of 10 per cent,
combined with a 50 per cent appreciation of the New Taiwanese dollar against
its US counterpart between 1986 and 1989, have undermined profits for
capital intensive industries and forced many low cost manufacturers overseas
or out of business.
Heavy industrial output fell from double to single digit growth from 1988
and was almost flat in 1990. Light industrial output fell for three
successive years, before recovering in 1991. According to government
figures, manufacturing profit margins fell to below 4 per cent in 1989.
Declining profitability seems to have contributed to an 8 per cent fall in
private investment in 1990.
Export growth was also constrained, but has risen again since last year as
exchange rates stabilised. But imports have grown even faster, fuelled by
consumer demand and machinery purchases for infrastructure spending.
Worried by these trends, the government has been urging companies to upgrade
technology, invest in automation, research and design. In strategic
industries like aerospace, it has been willing to help finance acquisitions
of advanced foreign technology.
Most of these initiatives have been inserted into the government's six-year
National Development plan, launched last year. The plan's budget will
largely be spent on infrastructure projects, such as transport, energy and
environmental improvements, which were neglected during the 1980s. Although
the plan is widely criticised for being poorly researched and leading to
inflation, set to rise to 4-5 per cent, it will guarantee growth.
Mr Jiang Ping-kun, vice minister of economics, said:
'Taiwan depends on industrial development. We have to upgrade from relying
on labour intensive industries to high-tech, and that needs investment both
by the government and the private sector.
Results have been mixed so far, although some of the measures have only just
taken effect. The government claims this year's increase in exports shows
companies are becoming more competitive.
But critics argue that the rise in exports is temporary and manufacturers
will again face squeezed margins if, as expected, the currency continues to
appreciate next year.
Companies being asked to upgrade have one good reason, and one good excuse,
not to do so. The good reason is China. By moving across the Taiwan Straits,
light industrial companies, which still account for more than 40 per cent of
exports, can take advantage of the low wages and land prices they used to
enjoy in Taiwan.
Restrictions on investing in China started to ease in 1987. Since then
Taiwanese companies are estimated to have invested at least Dollars 3bn in
the mainland, and anecdotal evidence suggests the trend is rising. However,
there are no precise figures because companies hide their identities for
political reasons.
Taiwan's trade with China through Hong Kong has grown rapidly since 1987 and
increased 34 per cent to more than Dollars 4bn for the first seven months of
the year. If other indirect trade and smuggling is included, total trade
could near Dollars 10bn this year. Exports from Taiwan are mostly destined
for processing in new Taiwanese factories on the mainland.
The good excuse is that most Taiwan companies are small, and often family
run, so lack resources to upgrade technology. Nearly 70 per cent of the
island's manufacturing companies employ less than 20 people. Taiwan has 352
pharmaceutical and medical equipment companies, for example, but less than
30 have capital bases of Dollars 4m or more. Growth through acquisition is
difficult because owners are unwilling to sell family businesses.

LATEST figures released in Israel show signs of improvement in the economy
which has been struggling with the burden of mass immigration from the
former Soviet Union.
The Labour-led government, which won power in June, is hoping the economy
has adjusted to the flow of some 400,000 immigrants since late 1989 and is
poised for a period of sustained growth.
Unemployment, which reached a record level of 11.6 per cent of the workforce
in the first quarter, fell to just less than 11 per cent in the second
quarter, according to official figures. Industrial production has, since
April averaged a monthly 1.5 per cent increase over the first quarter.
Aggregate first half profits of 330 publicly traded companies were up a
whopping 65 per cent over 1991.
Exports of goods have been ahead of last year by an average of more than 5
per cent a month since April. Tourism has recovered spectacularly from the
1991 slump induced by the Gulf war. It was up by 10 per cent in the first
nine months over the same period in 1990, before the Gulf crisis took hold.
Inflation, a perennial scourge, has come down to an annual rate of less than
10 per cent after totalling 18 per cent in 1991. Tax revenues were up by 8
per cent in real terms in the first nine months over 1991.
While GDP growth this year is expected to repeat the six per cent level
achieved in 1991, it will be greater in per capita terms because of a
slowdown in immigration this year. Officials also point out that in 1992,
growth has not been inflated by the state-induced construction boom which
accounted for about half output growth last year. They are encouraged by
evidence of increasing private sector investment, shown by a rise in imports
of capital goods.
There is a catch, however. The halving of immigration this year from the
150,000 who came in 1991 has eased the pressure on the economy, reducing
government budgetary problems, for example. If Israel's declared aim of
achieving a faster rate of immigration succeeds, the short-term effect may
be to blunt recovery.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Kuwaiti opposition to dominate assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT's political opposition has capped the most vigorously fought election
campaign in the emirate's history by winning a surprisingly substantial
majority in the country's 50-seat national assembly.
Almost all Kuwait's leading opposition figures won seats in what promises to
be a fiery and awkward assembly for the ruling al-Sabah family. The assembly
will be the first full parliament since Sheikh Jaber al-Sabah, the emir,
suspended the last for its obstinate opposition to the government in 1985.
Judged on the basis of candidates' campaign platforms, at least 30 outright
government opponents will sit in the assembly.
At least 18 elected candidates are directly linked to opposition Islamic
groups, particularly the moderate Sunni Islamic Constitutional Movement and
the more conservative Salaf, while 12 are broadly liberal opposition
figures, including two high-profile members of the Kuwait Democratic Forum,
Mr Abdulla Nibari and Mr Ahmed al-Khatib - who drew crowds of up to 8,000 at
some rallies.
Information ministry officials put the turnout at 85 per cent of Kuwait's
81,400 voters, after an uncommonly outspoken campaign. However, the
opposition's strong showing is certain to herald a period of tough political
haggling.
Immediate horse trading will centre on the appointment of a new cabinet,
which Sheikh Saad al-Sabah must name within 15 days of yesterday's formal
resignation of the sitting cabinet. Opposition leaders are already demanding
that at least half the cabinet must be formed from government critics in the
National Assembly - a step the government has always been deeply reluctant
to take.
Failure to meet opposition demands would almost certainly provoke an early
confrontation in the new assembly, which will open the first eight-month
term of its four-year tenure later this month.
Whatever the make-up of the cabinet, the assembly is certain to raise a host
of other potentially uncomfortable issues for the government.
High on the list of these are calls for an examination of the government's
conduct leading up to the invasion of Kuwait in August 1990, along with
popular demands for a probe into the management of Kuwait's overseas
investments - and the conduct of some of its managers - and the pursuit of
several senior figures believed still to owe large sums following the 1982
collapse of the informal Souq al-Manakh stock market.
Islamic groups are also seeking to change Kuwait's founding 1962
constitution by inserting an article stating that Islamic Sharia law shall
be the 'sole source' of legislation. The constitution now describes Sharia
as a 'main source' of Kuwait's laws. Observers suggest that the Islamic
groups are unlikely to win the two-thirds majority necessary to effect
constitutional change.
But few doubt that the opposition will rally strong support on most of the
election campaign's issues. At the same time, it would be very difficult for
the emir simply to suspend a troublesome parliament.

FRANCE yesterday levelled sharp criticism at the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the World Bank when it announced a big debt relief package for
four African countries, Reuter reports from Libreville.
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy told 14 heads of state at the Franco-African
summit in Gabon that France remained 'a militant advocate' for the troubled
continent.
'You are not alone. France is at your side,' he said, giving details of the
French initiative which officials said would help Gabon, Ivory Coast,
Cameroon and Congo. These middle-income but heavily indebted countries have
not benefited from past measures on behalf of the poorest African states.
Mr Beregovoy, standing in for convalescent President Francois Mitterrand,
said France would create a debt conversion fund of FFr4bn (Pounds 500m) by
the end of 1992.
A French official said the fund would partly be financed by debt repayments
from the four countries which would then be recycled into development
projects.

RIVAL Kurdish factions in northern Iraq were reported yesterday to be
engaged in a major clash, as Iraqi peshmerga fighters attempted to expel
rebel Turkish Kurds from their bases near the border.
The incident provides the first indication of the tacit co-operation of the
Iraqi Kurds in Turkey's conflict with the PKK, the Marxist guerrillas waging
an increasingly violent separatist campaign.
The attack follows warnings from the Iraq Kurdish Front to the PKK, which
has stepped up attacks on Turkish government positions since the Gulf war.
The presence of PKK forces in northern Iraq has threatened relations between
Turkey and the newly established Kurdish administration in northern Iraq.
Iraqi Kurds depend on aid supplied via Turkey.
Details of the fighting remain sketchy but one Turkish official confirmed a
'major clash' was happening Kurdish officials said their forces were
attacking three PKK camps near the town of Zakho. Aid workers in the area
said there were heavy casualties with local hospitals said to be
overflowing. Around 6,000 peshmergas were engaging 3,000 PKK guerrillas near
the villages of Shirwan and Hakuk.
Ankara remains anxious that the evolution of a de facto Kurdish state in
northern Iraq will encourage Turkey's Kurds to step up demands for
independence.
Meanwhile Iraqi Kurds fear Turkey's struggle with the PKK could imperil
allied air protection, which remains dependent on Turkish approval.

A DISPUTE between Warsaw and the EC over allocation of a Polish 30,000
vehicle duty-free import quota is delaying the planned takeover of Poland's
FSM car factory by Fiat Auto of Italy, Christopher Bobinski reports from
Warsaw.
Talks on sharing out the quota have gone on all year; the Poles hope today's
visit to the European Commission by Premier Hanna Suchocka will solve the
problem. Fiat is refusing to make a final commitment to the Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1bn) FSM project until it knows how many cars it can import into
Poland without paying a 35 per cent tariff.
The quota is worth Ecu 100m to western European manufacturers lobbying for
duty-free access, which the Poles originally wanted to restrict to Fiat, GM
Europe and Volkswagen.

EGYPT's programme of trade liberalisation and economic reform could be
torpedoed by domestic opposition if not supported by a successful Uruguay
Round and an effective multilateral trading system, a Gatt report on its
trade policies and practices says.
Gatt praises Egypt's economic reform programme, introduced in 1990 to push
the economy towards market-based export-oriented development. But it warns
this could be imperilled by interest groups which have created uncertainty
about its success. The reforms are independent of the Uruguay Round's
outcome, but 'pressure from such groups may become more difficult to resist
if the multilateral trading system is not seen to be working effectively'.
Gatt's governing council welcomed Egypt's will to press on with its
policies, though high tariffs were criticised. A speedy end to the Round
would improve access to developed markets for Egypt's textiles and farm
goods.

JAPAN has welcomed a letter from President Bush urging a quick settlement of

Premier Kiichi Miyazawa has written to assure Mr Bush Japan is dedicated to
resolving the Uruguay Round. Japanese trade negotiators said Mr Bush's
letter showed the US administration had been not been completely distracted
from the Round by the presidential election. But Tokyo fears divisions in
the EC will delay accord on farm trade.
Japan is building an international campaign against anti-dumping actions,
having selected an EC case against Japanese cassette tape makers as an
example of how these actions can be used to limit competition and hurt
consumer interests.

FT  07 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Mexican glee at Clinton's Nafta stance -
Salinas believes the cloud over the free trade pact has been lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is an unusual flourish today in the signature of Mexican President
Carlos Salinas as he initials the North American Free Trade Agreement
(Nafta) in San Antonio, Texas, do not be surprised: he and his government
again appear convinced passage of the pact is inevitable.
The optimism has nothing to do with the high-profile initialling, into which
Mr Salinas and Canada's Prime Minister Brian Mulroney have been dragged in
an effort to boost US President George Bush's flagging election chances.
The cause for celebration is the decision by Governor Bill Clinton, the
front-running challenger to Mr Bush, broadly to endorse the agreement and
not demand its re-negotiation if he is elected president.
While Mr Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has said that an acceptable
agreement should toughen Mexico's environmental and labour standards, he has
also said this could be achieved through parallel accords.
The treaty itself could stay intact. Mr Clinton recently made three
flattering references to Mexico, including the statement that he had never
known in Mexico a leadership as good as President Salinas's. 'The three
references by Mr Clinton show the great affinity between him and the Mexican
government,' a Mexican official said. 'We do not believe there will be a
great change of attitude in the US (to Mexico) if Clinton wins the
election.'
President Salinas can barely conceal his glee at the prospect of four more
years of excellent US-Mexican relations, a key not just to Nafta, but to
investor confidence in Mexico.
On Monday, he told a group of treaty advisers: 'It appears to me important
that Governor Clinton has pronounced in favour of Nafta, which shows his
interest in an economic relationship between the US and Mexico that will
benefit both nations.
'Now it can be confirmed the two most important political forces of the US
agree in the convenience of having the treaty.'
The official said there should be no difficulty reaching the necessary
parallel accords with Mr Clinton: 'The government (of Mexico) shares the
worries over the environment that Clinton has. I have the impression that
many of the worries are addressed in the treaty, but there is a disposition
to reach new parallel accords with the US, with or without the treaty.'
Mr Bush's campaign managers, in an effort to keep up pressure on the
challenger, have said that Mr Clinton can either be for or against the
treaty, but cannot be on both sides. The Mexican government evidently feels
differently.
The Mexican official reckons that the Clinton endorsement does not just
remove an 'obstacle' but, 'even more, with this signal, makes the
ratification more likely' in the US Congress. Mr Richard Gephardt, majority
leader in the House of Representatives, supports Mr Clinton's remarks,
backing away from earlier demands that the treaty be re-negotiated.
Mexico's stock market seemed to share the government's initial enthusiasm,
rising by 4.65 per cent on Monday, the largest one-day gain this year. Mr
Felix Bonni, head of research of the brokerage Interacciones, says: 'My
position has always been that Clinton is better for Mexico than Bush. The
chances of passing Nafta in the Congress are greater, while economic growth
in the US will be higher.' Such comments, heretical a few weeks ago, are now
almost conventional wisdom.
Mr Salinas had been savagely attacked in the independent Mexican press for
throwing all his eggs into Mr Bush's basket and acceding to his every wish.
Many prophesied doom for Mr Salinas and Mexico were Mr Bush to lose.
Mr Adolfo Aguilar, a columnist and academic, captured the spirit of the
criticism when he wrote in El Financiero a week ago that 'the presidential
victory of the Democrats will bring about changes in three fundamental
aspects.
'First, there will be the adverse and possibly devastating psychological
impact on investors and savers who depend of the financial stability of the
Salinas plan; second, now explicit, will be the re-opening of the
renegotiation of Nafta ..and, third, a foreseeable revision of the
complacent attitude of the government of the US with respect to the abuses
of political power, human rights, electoral fraud, and lack of democracy in
Mexico.'
Some of this is still likely to happen and will depend greatly on who would
run Mexican policy from a Clinton White House. Ms Cathryn Thorup, director
of studies for the Mexican-US programme at San Diego University, says: 'The
agenda for the relationship under the Democrats is likely to be different
and broader. A Democratic president would likely pay more attention to
immigration, human rights and democracy. George Bush would continue
emphasising economic integration.'
Mr Clinton might take his time asking Congress to sign the treaty, or make
impossibly difficult demands on the Mexicans to change environmental and
labour provisions. He may press Mexico to 'perfect' its democracy faster
than it would like. But he is unlikely, say analysts, to upset radically the
excellent relations established by Mr Bush.

FT  07 OCT 92 / World Trade News: EC aims for Gatt deal by end of year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JOLTED by a German appeal for a breakthrough on Gatt's Uruguay Round trade
talks, EC foreign and trade ministers yesterday agreed to make a determined
bid to reach a comprehensive deal by the end of the year.
US and EC trade negotiators plan to hold detailed discussions later this
week on the farm trade dispute that has for two years blocked progress on
the Uruguay Round. This would prepare the ground for ministerial talks in
Brussels on Sunday and Monday. EC ministers hope this will provide an
outline deal that can be endorsed by EC heads of government at the
Birmingham summit on October 16.
Evidence that significant progress was being made towards a US-EC deal on
reducing subsidised farm trade also came yesterday from Washington, where
farm trade lobbyists were voicing alarm that the Bush administration was
poised to make concessions aimed at finalising a Uruguay Round agreement.
A US-EC stand-off on reform of the EC's farm subsidy regime has blocked
progress on the Uruguay Round for two years. Other critical areas of
dispute, including services trade and tariff reductions, can only be tackled
when the farm issue is resolved.
At yesterday's meeting of EC foreign and trade ministers in Luxembourg, Mr
Jurgen Mollemann, Germany's economics minister, said a Gatt agreement was
vital to avoid further chaos in the financial markets and political
instability in Europe.
Mr Mollemann criticised the EC for failing to overcome political divisions,
especially now the Bush administration was interested in reaching a deal.
'We have arrived at the moment of truth. If there is no Gatt, we will be
pushed further into crises.'
Meanwhile in Brussels, EC officials emphasised that failure to settle the
US-EC farm trade dispute would make it virtually impossible to contain a
long-standing row over trade in oilseeds.
This centres on US claims for compensation of an estimated Dollars 2bn
(Pounds 1bn) for producers affected by EC subsidies that have twice been
condemned by Gatt dispute panels. The EC has offered compensation of no more
than Dollars 400m. Settlement of the oilseed dispute will also be a high
priority in Brussels this weekend.
Just to illustrate that EC member states are anything but united in their
attitudes to Sunday's meetings, Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, France's new farm
minister, said in Paris that President Francois Mitterrand was urging
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to resist US pressure to speed the trade
talks ahead of US elections. 'France is in a solitary position,' Mr Soisson
said. 'That is why President Mitterrand is having contacts with Mr Kohl to
loosen the stranglehold.'
Next Sunday's talks involve Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs
commissioner, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC
agriculture commissioner, and Mr Ed Madigan, US agriculture secretary. The
aim is to exploit what EC officials regard as a 'final window of
opportunity' to settle the Uruguay Round - between the French referendum on
Maastricht, and the US presidential election on November 3.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a British Foreign Office minister, said a 'narrow
window' of opportunity for a Gatt deal existed ahead of the election. 'Let
us not let it slip from our grasp,' he added, noting that President Bush had
clearly signalled his interest in reaching an agreement.
The ministers called a separate row over US action against EC steel
producers 'wholly unjustified' and reserved the right to refer it to Gatt.
An EC official said yesterday's meeting in Luxembourg was aimed at sending a
'political signal' it remained committed to a Gatt deal, within the existing
mandate.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EC has decided to extend the Multi-Fibre Arrangement covering
international textile trade and renew MFA pacts with certain third
countries. EC foreign and trade ministers approved the move in Luxembourg
yesterday, despite opposition by France, wanting more protection for
European textile industries.
Asian countries are likely to be disappointed that the new EC mandate,
dependent on a successful Gatt accord, is not more generous on extending
access to European markets. Linked to this tough stand, EC ministers opened
talks on plans to give the European Commission more power to push through
'commercial defence measures' covering anti-dumping duties, quotas and
safeguard clauses in the European single market.
Yesterday's meeting marked the start of the 'trade weapons' debate which
could see sharp splits between traditional free traders such as the UK and
Germany, and Spain and Italy which fear free circulation of goods after 1992
might weaken EC trade policy.
Another debate centred on the EC's proposals for reforming its banana import
regime in time for the 1992 single market. Member states are divided how
best to reconcile the EC's treaty obligation to support favoured suppliers
from the Caribbean, while not discriminating against 'dollar' banana
producers from Latin America.
A Commission plan to propose an EC-wide quota on banana imports from central
America risks violating Gatt procedures. Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, a British
Foreign Office minister, said he hoped for agreement before the end of
Britain's presidency this year, but issues were complex. 'There is no such
thing as a straight banana.'
Ministers agreed to offer modest concessions on liberalising trade in farm
products with Romania and Bulgaria.

FT  07 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Amato sees delay in budget approval
 -Backlog proves costly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS and ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government says there is little prospect of early parliamentary
passage of its 1993 budget despite the crisis of international confidence in
the lira and market pressures for quick action.
The 1993 budget, which seeks to raise L93,000bn (Pounds 41.6bn) in extra
revenues and spending cuts, will take at least until the end of November to
pass through both houses of parliament, according to prime minister Giuliano
Amato.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Amato said parliament's role had to be
respected. He said the process of approving the budget, which was presented
to parliament last Thursday, would take 'a couple of months'.
Both houses of parliament face a huge backlog of decrees and legislation.
Although deputies are being pressed to approve the budget as soon as
possible, they are insisting parliamentary procedures have to be respected.
Mr Amato remained confident the budget would be passed with only minor
amendments and appeared ready to see the blame for any delay shift directly
to the politicians.
Mr Amato conceded this strategy left his government in a delicate, indeed
almost helpless, position to confront speculation against the lira.
Locking Italy into the EMS 'with a sound parity for the lira' remained his
'preferred' strategy. Indeed, he saw no alternative to ensure international
credibility and tackling the country's rapidly deteriorating public
finances.
He admitted he had lost 'some face' by being forced to devalue the lira. But
he said the subsequent fall of the lira in its float since September 17 had
reached the point of a competitive devaluation, which was of concern to
Italy's commercial partners.
He maintained the current devaluation of over 20 per cent against the D-Mark
could be a bargaining card in discussions on Italian re-entry into the EMS.
He appeared reassured of support from Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl,
intimating they had reached some understanding at their summit in Florence
on September 17-18.
On the forthcoming Birmingham summit, he thought the exclusion of finance
ministers was a positive development since this would lessen the prospect of
the meeting becoming a hostage to the expectations of the markets. He was
cautious about the outcome, but said he was encouraged by the 'pro-European
intentions of John Major' set out in letters sent last week to European
leaders.
Mr Amato recognised that ERM re-entry was most unlikely before the budget
had been approved.
He added that budget approval was a precondition for a major policy decision
on whether Italy would issue Ecu-denominated bonds or bonds indexed to a
central parity against the D-Mark. Such a step would save on interest
charges. It would also mean that the government would assume the foreign
exchange risk that foreign investors in Italian paper would otherwise have
to accept. The idea was announced last week and is another attempt to retain
the credibility of Italian paper.
Mr Amato confirmed last week had seen a 'significant' run on the banks,
mainly in Rome, when rumours swept the capital of government plans to impose
capital controls. He was scornful of the example set by Italy's senators,
seen queueing to withdraw their deposits from the bank inside the parliament
building.
He was adamant Italy was not considering imposing foreign exchange controls,
saying such a step would be 'crazy' and would only drive investors and
savers away from Italian debt paper, which still needed to be renewed and
rolled over.
More than ever Mr Amato appeared to have few illusions about the durability
of his three-month-old four party coalition government, whose strength lies
in the lack of alternatives - either from the discredited and divided
political parties or in terms of the direction of economic policy.

DM

<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN lira oscillated wildly on the foreign exchanges yesterday
following the announcement by trade unions of a four-hour general strike
next Tuesday and growing concern about slow parliamentary approval of the
1993 budget.
The lira plunged to 980 against the D-Mark in early trading, before
recovering to a L948-L952 range by mid-morning and L930 by early afternoon.
Later, the Bank of Italy's indicative rates put the lira at L927, down
marginally from L925.49 on Monday.
Dealers admitted the heavy fall had been exaggerated by relatively thin
trading. However, they warned that yesterday morning's speculative attack
had brought the currency close to the L1,000 level originally proposed by
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, as a realistic future parity. Earlier
this year, forecasts of the L1,000 rate drew sharp criticisms from
ministers.
The steady fall in the lira - it has now lost more than a fifth of its value
from last month's pre-devaluation levels against the D-Mark - has been
attributed largely to speculation at a time of a political vacuum pending
parliamentary approval for the budget.
Recent auctions of government bonds have caused concern that the Bank of
Italy might have difficulty finding buyers for Italian government debt.
'Prices for 10-year government bonds at Monday's auction were so low that
investors are growing worried that the central bank may have to step in and
monetise the debt, fuelling inflation,' said an economist at one leading
bank.
However, many domestic observers now believe the lira has 'overshot'. Mr
Claudio Cavazza, a spokesman for the Confindustria employers' federation,
thought the currency was now 'undervalued'. The first step to alleviate the
current currency crisis was 'to approve the budget. . . . It's necessary to
send a positive signal abroad, because every day which passes costs us very
dear', he said.
Economists doubt Italy's European Community partners will accept a fall of
more than 20 per cent because of the sharp boost it would give to Italian
exports.

GERMANY needs to clarify its financing of unification to help strengthen

Italy, Britain and Spain were included in the group of countries needing to
bolster credibility. . . 'but also Germany, which has an unclear situation
about the financing of reunification,' he said.
Germany's reliance on debt to finance unification has been blamed by some
economists and politicians for forcing German interest rates higher and
pushing the Exchange Rate Mechanism close to collapse.
Lady Thatcher, former British prime minister, told a gathering of
businessmen in Madrid on Monday that the D-Mark was no longer a good anchor
for the ERM and that Germany had exported high rates to the rest of the
Community.
However, Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, denied that
its high interest rates were solely to blame for turmoil within European
money markets and said economic divergences among EC countries were the
fundamental cause.
He argued that a strong D-Mark had to remain the anchor of the EMS, and any
attempt to soften the system's parameters or to relax the commitment to
stability at its heart would be counter-productive.

<TEXT>
DENMARK'S prime minister, Mr Poul Schluter, yesterday called for a more open
and democratic European Community so that Danes could reverse their No to
the Maastricht treaty, Reuter reports from Copenhagen.
'The subsidiarity principle. . . . should be established as the EC's
fundamental law,' he told parliament.
'European co-operation should be characterised by the very opposite of
centralism, by something completely different than 'the United States of
Europe' which some people are talking about. It is quite clear that the
Maastricht treaty. . . cannot take effect without a common solution which
takes Denmark's No on June 2 into consideration.'
The outlines of the solution should be clear in time for the EC summit in
December.

<TEXT>
THE PESETA yesterday remained above its Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM) floor
against the D-Mark 24 hours after the Bank of Spain eased exchange controls
to reassure worried currency markets.
The currency held at Pta71.40 to the D-Mark, above its Pta72.6 ERM floor and
virtually unchanged from its Monday close. But there was continued market
scepticism about the currency's value.
Residents were once more allowed to conduct commercial operations on the
forward peseta market and there were no new restrictions on the spot market.
Mr Pedro Perez, secretary of state for the economy, said an interest rate
rise was 'not on the government's agenda for the moment,' and that a
devaluation of the peseta 'should not necessarily take place'.
There has been intense lobbying by Madrid for a general realignment of the
ERM, with a lower peseta parity.
Spain hasmaintained penalties on peseta loans through foreign exchange
markets.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY is pressing for sweeping change in the balance of power in EC
institutions which would rein back the Commission and devolve far greater
responsibilities to member states in virtually all areas of Community
activity.
Its proposals - contained in a confidential paper circulated to EC foreign
ministers this week - have alarmed states such as Ireland and Spain, which
look to the Commission to protect their interests.
Germany's emergence as the standard-bearer of subsidiarity - whereby the EC
defers to members states in matters which can be better handled at national,
regional or local level - has injected a fresh complication into UK efforts
to reach broad agreement among the Twelve before the Birmingham summit on
October 16, or a clear consensus at the Edinburgh summit in December.
Reaching an agreement on subsidiarity is viewed as a vital ingredient for
selling the Maastricht treaty on European political and monetary union to a
sceptical European public, and resolving the 'Danish question' caused by
Denmark's rejection of the treaty.
Although the British support Germany's hardline stand in principle, there
are fears that Bonn's enthusiasm for reducing the Commission's power may be
going too far, too quickly.
The German paper suggests that subsidiarity should apply to social,
education, cultural and health policy, where 'measures at the level of the
member states are sufficient.'
It also suggests assessing 'whether measures at national, (including EC)
level are at all necessary', a demand which some EC countries fear could
mark the start of an attack on the EC's powers in the area of competition
policy and regional aid.
According to the German paper, 'the federal government deems it imperative
that in each individual - ie for each separate action - the EC's
institutions be required to demonstrate that the criteria for the
subsidiarity principle are actually met'.
In addition, Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, told his EC partners
this week in Luxembourg that Bonn wanted the right to 'screen' all EC
proposals before they became legislative drafts. This demand was opposed by
smaller states which fear it could lead to countries opting out of
legislation they object to.
The paper also contains a plea for more responsibilities for the German
Lander.
Mr Douglas Hurd, British foreign secretary, said this week that the Twelve
should agree on new working procedures to apply subsidiarity, new criteria,
and fresh examples of subsidiarity at work - either through scrapping old
legislation or shelving new proposals. In fact, both the Commission and the
Council have found it difficult to pinpoint examples which all EC members
can agree on.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Major weathers blistering attack over Maastricht: Tebbit
speech threatens party unity - Hurd heads off Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday scraped over the first hurdle on the road to British
ratification of the Maastricht treaty. But in a withering attack on the
prime minister from the floor of the Conservative conference, Lord Tebbit
threatened to plunge the party into civil war.
After a heated debate in Brighton which also saw Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, warn Tory activists that the party could 'break itself'
over the issue, the prime minister won a four-to-one majority.
Senior colleagues said Mr Major was now determined to bring the Maastricht
legislation back to the House of Commons by the end of this month, even if
the detailed examination of the bill had to be deferred until early next
year.
But during the angriest exchanges seen at a Tory conference for more than a
decade, Lord Tebbit exposed the divisions which have dogged the
Conservatives since they forced the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher's resignation
two years ago.
In a vituperative performance which played to the nationalism of the Tory
party faithful, Lord Tebbit threatened at one point to turn the conference
against Mr Major. More than a third of the representatives rose to their
feet to cheer his demand that: 'This conference wants policies for Britain
first, Britain second and Britain third.'
In scenes reminiscent of the battles over Rhodesia which engulfed the
Conservatives during the 1970s, Lord Tebbit delivered a stark warning to Mr
Major that his battle with the party's Euro-sceptics would be protracted and
bloody.
As Mr Major sat grimly on the conference platform, Lord Tebbit won a
standing ovation from large sections of the audience for a speech which
derided the prime minister's economic policy and flatly condemned
Maastricht.
His intervention followed a similar attack on Maastricht earlier in the day
by Mr Kenneth Baker. The former home secretary, who has now emerged at the
head of opposition to the treaty in the House of Commons, said he would vote
against the agreement that he had backed as a cabinet minister.
The Euro-sceptics' stance was comprehensively rebutted by Mr Hurd in what
was widely judged as a brilliant speech. It won him a standing ovation from
many of the same representatives who had cheered Lord Tebbit. Mr Hurd warned
that any move to renege on Maastricht would shove Britain and its government
on to the 'sidelines' of Europe: 'Let us decide to give that madness a
miss'.
The foreign secretary announced that alongside the declaration on 'minimum
interference' or 'subsidiarity' expected from the EC summit in Birmingham
next week, Mr Major was seeking a commitment from his European counterparts
to much greater openness in decision-making.
Last night Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, joined the fray on the
side of the prime minister by pouring scorn on the 'blind alley' into which
opponents of Maastricht wanted to lead Britain. The government would no
longer have a voice in international affairs if it opted for 'splendid
political isolation'.
Both Mr Hurd and Mr Clarke stressed that Maastricht would lead the Community
not in the direction of a European 'superstate' but along the road of
decentralisation and enlargement in the Community. He insisted that the
government was winning the argument over the future direction of Europe.
Senior ministers said the government had been shaken by the force of Lord
Tebbit's attack. But it had also reinforced Mr Major's determination to use
his closing address on Friday to reinforce his support for the treaty. That
would follow a speech tomorrow by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, setting
out the central planks of the economic policy which will replace the
European exchange rate mechanism.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Treasury discusses proposals for more open style
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has unveiled far-reaching proposals to meet criticisms that it
has made serious mistakes over economic policy and become remote from the
City and industry.
The initiative could lead to a more open style at Whitehall's most important
department, whose reputation has been severely dented during Britain's
longest recession for 50 years.
One plan under consideration would lead to non-government economists being
asked to work on Treasury forecasts to improve their accuracy, in the
biggest shake-up at the Treasury since the early 1980s.
Other ideas being considered include:
Greater efforts to recruit people with experience in industry and financial
markets, possibly by increasing salaries for specific individuals.
Paying companies to undertake studies in areas such as financial
deregulation.
Less secrecy in internal discussion of proposed policy changes, for instance
over taxation, as part of a new policy to encourage wider swapping of ideas
with the private sector.
Revamping procedures for making economic forecasts, which in the past two
years have turned out to be optimistic.
Sir Terry Burns, Treasury permanent secretary, presented the ideas at an
unpublicised meeting of the Treasury's top 70 officials on Monday, held at
the Institution of Civil Engineers in central London.
The proposals are being drawn up as the Treasury attempts to find a new
economic strategy after the shock of Britain's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism three weeks ago.
The Treasury's tactics in attempting to defend the pound ahead of ERM
suspension have been widely criticised in the City. The department has also
come under attack from politicians and industrialists for misjudging the
seriousness of the recession.
Sir Terry's ideas are being presented as a 'green paper' for internal
debate, and lack detail.
They may need to be refined after discussions with ministers, who may be
worried that less Treasury secrecy could lead to more potentially
embarrassing 'leaks' about details of policy actions.
That could involve drawing more on ideas about how the economy is
progressing from people in industry and the City, possibly by paying such
individuals for specific aspects of forecasting.
Steps may also be taken to improve training and flexibility among the 1,500
employees in the central policymaking departments.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Scottish Widows ordered to review 20,000 life policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH WIDOWS, one of the UK's largest insurance companies, has been
ordered by the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Organisation to
inform more than 20,000 policyholders that they may have been sold the wrong
policy.
The policies were sold by Scottish Widows' tied agents - financial advisers
which sell the products of one company exclusively but which are not
directly employed by it.
A compliance check by Lautro, which started in April, discovered that some
sales agents had gathered too little information on policyholders to be able
to offer best advice, as required by industry regulators. Scottish Widows is
checking policies sold by all its tied agency firms.
Mr Robert Hogarth, Scottish Widows' compliance manager, resigned in July
after the investigation began. Scottish Widows, which sold just under
129,000 policies last year, is one of the UK's top 10 performing life
insurance and pensions houses.
The activities of tied agents have been a particular concern for Lautro
which has targeted that category of sales agent for special review.
Up to 45 per cent of policies sold via 'direct' or 'tied' agents are
terminated within the first two years of the contract, compared with only 22
to 32 per cent of policies sold through independent financial advisers,
according to data from the Securities and Investments Board, the chief
regulatory watchdog.
Scottish Widows says its preliminary review of all 27,000 policies sold by
tied agents since it first recruited them in February 1989 found only 6,200
were completely satisfactory. In another 3,240 cases, an unsuitable policy
may have been sold.
In the remaining 17,500 cases, there is not enough information for Scottish
Widows and Lautro to decide whether best advice was given and a suitable
product sold.
Scottish Widows is writing to more than 20,000 policyholders, inviting those
who may have an inappropriate policy to consult one of the company's own
agents. Policyholders on whom not enough information is available will be
asked to fill in a short questionnaire detailing their financial
circumstances.
The company has promised Lautro that its full review of the policies will be
completed by November 30.
Mr Newton Scott, general manager, marketing and sales at Scottish Widows,
said the company had reduced the number of tied agency firms it used to 143
from 184 at the end of last year. 'Some firms were not capable of producing
enough quality business. Some are not complying and are not meeting the sort
of standards we wanted,' he said.
Scottish Widows sells 90 per cent of its policies through IFAs but is trying
to create a direct sales force which is scheduled to be in place at the
beginning of next year.
In cases where an unsuitable product is found to have been sold, Scottish
Widows will try to replace the policy with a more suitable one.
If it does not have a suitable policy available or if a life product was not
the best form of investment for the client, the company is obliged by the
Financial Services Act to restore them to the financial situation they would
have been in had they not taken the contract.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Lamont to reveal aspects of economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, will respond to criticism of a vacuum in
UK economic policy by explaining at the Conservative party conference
tomorrow how the government plans to manage the economy with sterling
outside the European exchange rate mechanism.
Although his speech in the conference's economic debate will be couched in
party political language, it is understood that it will break with tradition
by giving details of the government's strategy to control inflation and
secure recovery.
Mr Lamont will stress that the government will take the sterling exchange
rate into account to ensure a tight overall policy and underline the need to
keep control over public spending.
The decision to use a party political event to disclose aspects of economic
policy reflects Treasury concern at the steep fall in sterling and UK equity
values. Monday's drop in the pound and the 103-point decline in the FT-SE
index were largely blamed on the government's failure to explain its
economic strategy since sterling's float.
Yesterday, however, the pound bounced back 5 1/2 pfennigs from Monday's
London close to finish in London at DM2.4475 but analysts were not convinced
it would hold this level for long. In New York it closed at DM2.45.
Mr George Magnus, economist at SG Warburg in London, said many
imponderables, such as the lack of UK economic policy and rumours of the
reintroduction of capital controls in Italy, made European investors
nervous.
The dollar closed in London at DM1.4300, up more than 2 pfennigs, after the
Federal Reserve failed to announce a rate cut on the first day of its open
markets committee meeting. It eased in New York to DM1.428.
The lira staged a spectacular recovery after falling 6 per cent at one
point. It finished in London at L916.2 against the D-Mark, compared with a
low of L985 and Monday's close of L934.4. In New York it finished at
L922.13.
Selling pressure on European shares also eased. In London, the FT-SE 100
share index rose 42.1 to 2,488.4, while share prices in Germany also
stabilised.

FT  07 OCT 92 / International Company News: Iri defends sale of Finsiel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRI, the Italian state holding company criticised for its decision last week
to sell its majority-owned Finsiel software subsidiary, yesterday issued a
statement defending the deal.
The move came as Stet's shares recovered by 4.35 per cent to L1,080,
recovering a fraction of Monday's plunge of more than 23 per cent.
Iri said selling Finsiel to the Stet telecommunications group, which it also
controls, had a strong industrial logic in view of the increasing use of
digital telecommunications technology. The group indirectly refuted
accusations that the deal had been hurriedly devised in order to bolster its
debt-laden balance sheet by indicating that the transaction had been under
consideration for some time.
Finsiel, which made net profits of L29.4bn (Dollars 22.35m) on sales of
L1,283bn last year, has a virtual monopoly of software services for Italy's
public sector.
However, current activities in telecommunications are limited to a small
subsidiary owned jointly with a Stet subsidiary.
Iri also argued that the L700bn price for the sale of its 83.3 per cent
stake was in line with similar transactions for software groups elsewhere.
The precise figure would be reached through specialist valuations now under
way, and a third valuation would be made in case of sharp differences.
The comments did little to calm critics, who attacked the deal as little
more than an accounting exercise that should give Iri an extraordinary gain
of around L650bn this year.
Their main objection is that the sale offers little immediate advantage for
Stet.
The group, in the middle of an ambitious investment plan to improve domestic
telecommunications, is heavily indebted. Stet's cash-flow is already
inadequate to finance its investments, and critics say buying Finsiel is an
unnecessary luxury.
Stet has also tapped investors regularly through big rights issues, which
have depressed the share prices of the group and its subsidiaries.

FT  07 OCT 92 / Kandinsky study may reach Pounds 5m: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN IMPORTANT work by Wassily Kandinsky, arguably the first great abstract
painter of the 20th century, is to come under the hammer at Sotheby's in
London in December.
Kandinsky gave it to the artist Paul Klee, whose grandson has submitted it
for auction. Sotheby's anticipates a price of about Pounds 5m.
'Sketch 1' is a signed and dated oil study for Kandinsky's most innovative
abstract painting of 1913, 'Composition VII', which hangs in the Tretiakov
Gallery in Moscow.
The auction house describes it as one of the two most important works by the
artist to have appeared at auction in the past 30 years. The other is
'Fugue' of 1914 which the Guggenheim Museum sold in 1990 - at the peak of
the market - for Dollars 20.9m.
'Sketch 1' is among four paintings estimated at more than Pounds 4m and some
14 valued at more than Pounds 1m to be offered by Sotheby's and Christie's
in London and New York this autumn.
'It is reassuring to find top-quality works of art returning to the market
after an interval of two years', commented Mr Simon de Pury, deputy chairman
of Sotheby's Europe.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the car and truck subsidiary of the Daimler-Benz group, is
reacting to slack world economic conditions by extending the Christmas and
New Year holiday for its domestic workforce from four days to seven and is
not ruling out short-time working in 1993, writes Andrew Fisher in
Frankfurt.
Daimler-Benz also announced it had acquired a 5 per cent stake in South
Korean automotive company Ssangyong Motor.
The move follows a co-operation agreement between Mercedes Benz and
Ssangyong signed in January 1991. Under this deal, Ssangyong will produce
about 50,000 Mercedes MB 100 vans a year under licence from 1994.
Mercedes-Benz said in June that it was reducing its workforce substantially
through early retirement, the ending of temporary employment contracts, and
non-replacement of those leaving.
As a result, the German plants will employ 10,500 fewer workers at the end
of the year than in January, when the workforce totalled 185,000.
Mercedes has already said car output would drop this year by 35,000 to
543,000 units as a result of slower sales at home and uncertainty over
exports.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark agrees to detailed takeover talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of C&amp;J Clark, the UK's biggest shoe manufacturer, has agreed to
detailed talks over a possible bid from a consortium comprised of Electra
Investment Trust and Specialist Research Unit, a firm of consultants.
SRU, which has been associated with Clark for more than 25 years, approached
Electra Investment Trust some weeks ago about backing a possible bid.
Clark said the talks were centred on a price 'substantially more than Pounds
100m.'
The discussions have been welcomed by the Clark board as 'friendly and
constructive'.
Electra has previously said it would not back a hostile offer.
Clark said it would be 'helpful' if the discussions could be settled before
its extraordinary general meeting on October 16.
That is when shareholders will vote on resolutions calling for the
resignation of Mr Walter Dickson, chairman, and another director.
The resolutions were put forward by a minority group of family shareholders
dissatisfied with corporate strategy and falling profits.
Clark is some 70 per cent held by more than 500 family members and six of
the 11 directors belong to the Clark family.
Mr Colin Fisher, managing director of SRU, is well known to the Clark board.
If SRU decides to make an offer, it is likely that Mr Fisher would be given
a place on the board.
Any successful offer is unlikely, however, to result in wider board changes.

UNITA, Angola's former rebel movement, withdrew from the country's newly
formed joint armed forces yesterday in protest at what it called fraud in
the country's first multi-party elections last week, agencies report from
Luanda.
The move came just hours after Mr Paulo Alcides Mango, the organisation's
secretary-general, called on the National Electoral Council to halt
publication of election results. 'If it does not, the (council) will have to
accept fully what will happen in the country,' he said.
A western diplomat said: 'This is very grave, one of many moves in a very
complicated game.'
Unita has about 3,000 soldiers in the newly unified armed forces. But it has
25,000-30,000 fighters being demobilised in 22 assembly areas across the
country who could easily be rearmed.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (10): A Quantum
leap forward - Raymond Snoddy looks at two new projects for cable TV viewers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE US, long the original home of multi-channel television, the number of
channels available to viewers is starting to take a quantum leap forward.
Two contrasting projects, each designed to offer no fewer than 150 channels,
one involving the use of fibre optic cable technology and the other high
power television satellites, show what is becoming possible in a country
where 60 per cent of homes already have cable television and 70 channel
systems are not unusual.
Now, 3,000 cable subscribers in the New York borough of Queens can chose
from 150 channels through Quantum, a project set up by Time Warner, the
world's largest media organisation. Fibre optic trunk networks have been
added to the existing co-axial cable
The 'conventional' 75 channels carried by the system include channels for
Korean, Chinese, Indian and Greek minorities.
The aim of the new system is not to multiply endlessly the number of
separate channels beyond the capacity of programme providers to supply or
viewers to choose. At the heart of the Quantum project is a significant
development of pay-per-view movies - charging for each film viewed.
No fewer than 57 channels are given over to around 15 films a week. Because
of the enormous channel capacity five channels can be devoted to showing a
single hit film - say JFK - with staggered starts so that on one of the
channels the film is starting anew every 30 minutes. Using a system that
appears to be as much a personal computer as a television set the converter
boxes produced by Pioneer of Japan offers viewers menu options on the screen
for ordering films. Viewers press a button to call up any one of six hit
films. Hits costs Dollars 3.95. Adult movies cost Dollars 4.95 with
children's films Dollars 1.95.
Quantum says the first 5,000 systems delivered from Japan have already been
snapped up with some people taking more than one for different rooms of the
house.
The Quantum project has been hailed as the beginning of a new phase in cable
technology.
It is also a sign of the increasing interest being shown in creating yet
another revenue 'window' for the movies. In timing pay-per-view will
probably slot in immediately after the theatrical release of a film and
before video rental and sale. Then it is on to premium films channels on
cable before films finally end up on normal broadcast television and
'classic' or old movie channels.
No figures are yet available; some of the boxes were only installed in July
and Time Warner plans to take the system to other cable networks.
As well as offering more chances to see recent films the system offers the
possibility of interactivity - two-way communication for everything from
home banking to home shopping.
On a larger scale, Hughes Communications is pushing ahead with a plan to
offer 150 channels of satellite television all over the US.
Hughes, the aircraft and communications division of General Motors, has
already committed Dollars 500m to the project with the first of three
satellites due for launch late next year. The actual programme service is
due to begin in 1994.
Mr Eddy Hartenstein, president of DirectTv, a Hughes subsidiary, says the
company simply decided to go ahead on its own after it proved impossible to
create a workable consortium.
Hughes brought together some of the leading players in the industry - Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, NBC, the network broadcaster and
Cablevision, the cable television operator. A memorandum of understanding
was signed but Hughes was unable to get agreement with the other potential
partners on an acceptable balance of risk and benefit.
It also did not help that Mr Murdoch was experiencing a Dollars 7.6bn debt
crisis which meant that for News Corp new high-risk ventures were definitely
on the back-burner.
Hughes decided it could go with the venture when Mr Stanley Hubbard's United
States Satellite Broadcasting consortium committed to take five channel
transponders on the first of the three 16-transponder satellite. United
States Satellite Broadcasting also paid Dollars 50m up front of a total
commitment of more than Dollars 100m. USSB will be running its own programme
service.
The system plans to use digital compression techniques - turning the
pictures into digital form - to multiply the number of channels that can be
carried on a single transponder that now broadcasts one channel.
The home receiving system, which will be distributed under the RCA brand
name, is designed to retail initially at around Dollars 700m. The high power
satellites will broadcast to 18-inch satellite dishes.
The venture is primarily aimed at the 40m US homes that do not have cable
television but could also offer more choice in areas where it will be
expensive to upgrade old cable systems.
Mr Hartenstein believes the company could be reaching 10m homes by the end
of the decade.
A large slice of the channel capacity - no fewer than 40-50 channels - will
be devoted to a pay-per-view movie service with films starting every 30
minutes.
A second important strand of programming will feature subscription sports
television. The service will cover big games not being broadcast by
conventional national broadcasters.
Earlier this year Hughes also signed a deal with the National Rural
Telecommunications Co-operative. The deal allows NRTC, which provides
telecommunications and electric services to more than 12m rural homes, to
market a package of 20 channels of cable and broadcast television programmes
in return for a distribution fee of up to Dollars 250m. The majority of
homes in rural areas do not have access to cable television.
Both Quantum and DirectTv are signs not only that more channels of
television are on the way but that films on demand and the associated
revenues are fast becoming a practical proposition in the US.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: DNO seeks share suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DNO, the oil company controlled by Mr Torstein Hagen, the Norwegian
investor, yesterday requested a suspension of trading in its shares while
discussions were taking place with institutional investors in Nedlloyd, the
Netherlands' biggest transportation group.
DNO holds about 6 per cent of Nedlloyd's capital and is seeking to boost
this shareholding significantly through purchases from institutional
shareholders.
Mr Tor Olav Troeim, DNO's managing director, said yesterday the company's
shares could be suspended for at least two weeks, but this would depend on
the outcome of discussions to increase the company's Nedlloyd stake.
DNO said that negotiations with the Nedlloyd institutional shareholders were
'to gather a considerable ownership position in Nedlloyd into DNO'.
Mr Troeim suggested that talks were being held with Nedlloyd institutional
investors holding 50 per cent stake in the Dutch company. He would not
disclose the identity of the institutions.
The suspension comes a month after Mr Hagen, DNO chairman and also a
shareholder in Nedlloyd, won a seat on the company's supervisory board
following a ruling in his favour by the Amsterdam Court of Appeals.
Mr Hagen is also the board chairman of Marine Investments, DNO's parent
company, which also holds shares in Nedlloyd. In all, it is believed that Mr
Hagen controls an estimated 25 per cent stake in the transport group through
subsidiaries.
Mr Troeim said that the suspension would stop market speculation. When DNO
released its half-year results at the beginning of last month, it reported
the sale of more than 600,000 Nedlloyd shares, realising a gain of NKr15.4m.
At that time, DNO's board warned that the restructuring of Nedlloyd was
proceeding too slowly and this was reflected by a sharp fall in the
company's share price to Fl 35 at the beginning of September from Fl 56 at
the end of June.
The board said that several of Nedlloyd's largest shareholders had contacted
Mr Hagen requesting him to accelerate the restructuring of the company.
'The board is disappointed that the matter has become so drawn out and will
closely evaluate, together with other major shareholders in Nedlloyd, the
alternatives available,' DNO said last month.
Some analysts believe that Mr Hagen is seeking to consolidate his Nedlloyd
shareholding into DNO from Marine Investments, and it was highly unlikely
the company would seek to make a full bid for the Dutch group.

FT  06 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: RHM in the toaster
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson's buccaneering spirit is evidently not entirely dead. Whatever its
stated intentions for RHM, it is difficult to square yesterday's Pounds 780m
bid with the reformed Hanson that is supposedly concentrating on organic
growth in its established businesses. RHM looks rather more like a victim of
Hanson's old opportunistic style: an undervalued company with a sense of
drift. Sales last year were lower than in 1987, earnings did not quite match
those of 1988. Moreover, Hanson has chosen to swoop when there is at last a
faint prospect of higher bread prices.
In RHM's record, there is hardly a crumb of comfort. Its management has
manifestly failed to reward the loyalty of shareholders at the time of the
465p Goodman Fielder Wattie bid in 1988. There has undoubtedly been
rationalisation, but acquisition accounting would create scope for Hanson to
take out more costs. By going for margin rather than market share it could
turn RHM's milling and baking division into a cash generative business
similar to tobacco. Admittedly, the supermarkets have a large say in the
bread price, but the benefits of reduced capacity in the baking industry
were not lost on ABF yesterday. It was the only FT-SE stock to rise.
That still leaves the question of whether Hanson is offering a fair price.
On consensus expectations for this year it amounts to a prospective multiple
of less than 12. Hanson could conceivably recoup the bulk of its outlay
through disposals of the non-bakery business. So shareholders might be
tempted to hold out for a little more. But it is not clear where a rival
bidder would come from. Nor is victory for Hanson a matter of strategic
necessity. RHM is a good deal smaller than some of the other victims it has
digested. Though the acquisition would reduce the burden of unrelieved ACT,
it would add less than 10 per cent to pre-tax profits.

FT  06 OCT 92 / The battle of the breadline: Hanson's Pounds 780m bid for
RHM is the biggest threat the food group has faced, say Guy de Jonquieres
and Maggie Urry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman of RHM, the baking and grocery group, has a
reputation as one of the great survivors of Britain's food industry. He has
not only enjoyed an exceptionally long innings at the top of his company -
eight years as managing director and three as chairman - but since 1988 has
twice successfully defended it against predators.
However, yesterday's Pounds 780m bid for RHM by Hanson lands Mr Metcalfe
with the challenge of his career. A well-financed conglomerate with a
fearsome talent for acquisition, Hanson looks a far more formidable
adversary than Goodman Fielder Wattie, the Australian food group which bid
for RHM in 1988, or the short-lived consortium headed by Sir James Goldsmith
which became RHM's biggest shareholder a year later.
Equally important, RHM appears far more vulnerable today. While it could
boast in 1988 that its profits growth in the previous five years had
outstripped the rest of the food industry, its recent performance has
deteriorated alarmingly. Pre-tax profits fell 36 per cent in the first half,
and industry observers expect a full-year result of less than Pounds 100m,
well down on last year's Pounds 150.2m.
This record has sorely tried the patience of RHM's shareholders, who barely
four years ago were staring at a 465p per share offer by Goodman Fielder
which valued their company at Pounds 1.73bn. Nor has Mr Metcalfe's attitude
to investor relations endeared him to the City of London, where he is widely
viewed as aloof and uncommunicative. His recent efforts to secure investor
loyalty have relied heavily on a determination to hold RHM's dividend.
More fundamentally, industry experts have faulted RHM for lacking clear
strategic vision and direction. Though Mr Metcalfe is praised for shaking up
RHM in the early 1980s, shedding peripheral activities and investing in
efficient manufacturing, critics argue that he has since taken his eye off
the ball.
Though his efforts to expand beyond milling and baking have reduced the
latter to about 40 per cent of total turnover, diversification has brought
mixed results. Some acquisitions, notably the Pounds 281m purchase of Avana
foods in 1987, have been disappointing, as has RHM's involvement in the US.
The sternest criticism, though, is that since Goodman Fielder first took a
stake in RHM in 1986, top management has spent too much time worrying about
insulating itself against the risk of takeover. 'They have concentrated too
much on the share price and not enough on strengthening the long-term
position of the business,' says Mr David Lang, industry analyst with
stockbrokers Henderson Crosthwaite.
Given RHM's signal failure to keep its share price up, few in the City were
surprised by yesterday's bid. Indeed, the company is rumoured to have been
hawked around the food industry as a potential target for several weeks.
Nonetheless, it is not certain that Hanson will have a clear run. Though its
offer of 220p a share is 45p above the price at which RHM shares closed on
Friday, it falls some way short of the company's break-up value, which some
in the City put at Pounds 900m to Pounds 1bn. Much of this lies in RHM's
collection of small but desirable grocery brands, which were valued on its
balance sheet at Pounds 608m in August last year.
It is possible, therefore, that RHM could yet attract a counter-bidder or
find a white knight. However, its quest a couple of years ago for a friendly
merger partner came to nothing - at least partly because of anxieties about
its troubled bread-baking business.
Indeed, since a bread price war broke out three years ago, savaging RHM's
profits, this part of the business has been widely considered the company's
most effective poison pill. Hanson's readiness to take on the challenge of
running it is, accordingly, its strongest trump card.
RHM is Britain's second-largest baker after Associated British Foods. In the
past decade, it has radically overhauled its operations, replacing 65 small,
elderly bakeries with 18 efficient high-capacity plants. It also saved money
by replacing a fragmented local distribution system with an integrated
national one, anticipating the emerging needs of powerful supermarket groups
which now dominate bread sales.
However, these large investments have not shielded the company from fierce
competition from a small band of independent bakers and millers. Operating
with lower overheads than RHM and ABF, these privately-owned concerns have
aggressively won cut-price business from the big supermarkets, many of which
have increasingly treated bread as a loss-leader. At one point last year
standard white loaves, the industry's staple product, were on sale for as
little as 27p, compared with about 40p in the late 1980s.
RHM and ABF have responded by by following prices down in an attempt to hold
on to market share. Though their profits have taken a beating, the two
companies have reasoned that the only way to restore their control over the
market was to eliminate excess capacity by driving their upstart competitors
to the wall.
Industry experts are divided over their success. Some believe the high
margins enjoyed by the industry in the late 1980s will never return. They
argue that the supermarkets are now in the driving seat and will ensure that
enough independent bakers remain in business to keep the industry leaders
permanently off-balance.
Others, however, think the market may soon stabilise. ABF is believed to be
planning capacity cuts, while a poor northern European harvest is depriving
independent bakers and millers of access to the cheap grain which they
relied on to produce cut-price bread. Indeed, some in the industry believe
there is a good chance of making an imminent price increase stick.
If the optimists are right, Hanson will have called the turn in the industry
brilliantly. If they are wrong, the company could still improve short-term
margins substantially by making the steady capacity cuts which RHM has so
far refused to contemplate. Such thinking appears to have contributed to a
sharp rise yesterday in the share price of ABF.
Though Hanson's talents as a marketing organisation are debatable, its
record as a cost-cutter and manager of low-tech manufacturing is widely
respected. Bread, a commodity product in long-term decline, could lend
itself well to the same type of management approach as Hanson has brought to
the tobacco business of Imperial Group, which it acquired in 1986. Since
then, the business has doubled its profits.
But threats of savage retrenchment at a time of rising unemployment could
also play into the hands of RHM, which energetically mobilised political
opinion against Goodman Fielder's bid.
In any event, the lack of other plausible bidders for RHM's bread division
would be likely to leave Hanson lumbered with it for the foreseeable future.
The same may not be true, however, of the rest of the business, which
consists of a mixture of branded groceries and 'private label' food items
sold by supermarkets under their own name.
Hanson will not be drawn on its plans. But it has only limited experience of
running packaged grocery companies, and sold off the food businesses of
Imperial and SCM in the US soon after acquiring them. Its only food-related
business today is the Seven Seas vitamin pill and fish oil company.
If Hanson decided to sell RHM's food operations, there would be no shortage
of takers. Though none of the businesses is a mega-brand, and some have
suffered from trading down by consumers in the recession, many have
established highly profitable niche positions.
The head of a competing food manufacturer said recently that he would give
his eye teeth for Sharwoods, RHM's sauces and condiments business, while old
favourites such as Paxo stuffing and Bisto gravy mixes continue to dominate
admittedly mature markets. Mr Kipling's cakes and pastries have also been
consistent money spinners.
Some critics accuse RHM of not doing enough to support these brands,
preferring instead to conserve cash by building up its private label
business, which requires minimal investment in product innovation and none
in marketing. They also argue that it has been too slow expanding into
continental Europe, where it earned only Pounds 73.6m of its Pounds 1.5bn
sales last year.
It is doubtful how much Hanson would do, if it kept RHM intact, to improve
on either of these points. Much more likely, it would choose to realise the
value of RHM's brands by auctioning them off to one or several bidders,
either in the UK or abroad. In the latter camp, BSN of France, and CPC and
Conagra of the US are already being mentioned as potential buyers.
Valuing the RHM brands is extremely difficult. Some analysts believe they
are overstated in the company's balance sheet because that valuation -
highly controversial at the time - was decided in a bull market, when
investors and food manufacturers were gripped by an onset of brand frenzy.
But much would depend on the nature and ambitions of bidders. The prices
paid would be influenced not only by the brands' earning record, but by
their potential for expansion in the hands of a new owner. While it is hard
to imagine that there would be much demand outside Britain for Paxo or
Bisto, Mr Kipling might find a wider market in continental Europe.
However, the main appeal of RHM's brands is that they could expand the
operations of a UK competitor or offer an entree into the British market for
a foreign company. In recent years, the huge marketing costs involved in
establishing brands from scratch have made acquisitions an increasingly
attractive option.
However, a wave of takeovers in the UK food industry has taken many
attractive companies off the market in the past few years. Of the larger
ones which remain independent, only Allied Lyons, Cadbury Schweppes and
United Biscuits still command strong brands and market position. Of those
which remain, many are struggling in low-margin commodity businesses or are
paying the price for over-expansion in the 1980s.
For these reasons, the progress of Hanson's battle for RHM will be followed
with close attention by acquisition-minded food companies in the UK and
abroad. But by the same token, it seems unlikely to signal the start of
another big round of takeovers in the industry.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Inco to cut nickel output in
response to falling prices
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCO, the western world's biggest nickel producer, is to cut output by 40m
pounds over the next 12 months in response to the unremitting decline in
world metal prices.
The Toronto-based company yesterday outlined a number of measures which will
reduce production of finished nickel to about 380m pounds in 1993 and reduce
its capital spending by USDollars 50m.
But Inco asserted that it has no intention of losing market share, which
amounts to between a quarter and a third of western production. The company
said it will continue to satisfy all customers' requirements.
The cutbacks, which are less severe than some earlier rumours had suggested,
stem partly from a fall in stainless steel production, which accounts for
more than half of nickel consumption. In addition, nickel prices have been
put under pressure by a sharp increase in Russian exports.
Inco's cutbacks will be most heavily felt by high-cost operations in Canada.
The austerity measures include an indefinite postponement of the planned
reopening of the Shebandowan mine in north-west Ontario, which was due to
take place later this month.
The company's Sudbury mines will be closed for three weeks over Christmas
and the smelter there will operate at a 'much reducted' rate.
Similar shutdowns will take place at Thompson, Manitoba, and at Port
Colbourne, Ontario. Both the Ontario and Manitoba divisions will also take a
four-week vacation during the summer of 1993.
The nickel refinery at Clydach, Wales, will switch from two lines to one
line to accommodate the reduced feed of raw material from Canada.
Executive salaries and directors' fees are being cut by 10 per cent and a
hiring freeze will be put in place as part of a wide-ranging effort to
reduce costs.
Inco's share price dropped 12 cents on the Toronto stock exchange yesterday
to close at CDollars 28.63. The announcement of cutbacks was made after the
market closed.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metal prices continue dropping
after poor world economy data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD gloom about worldwide economic activity took its toll at the
London Metal Exchange yesterday. Prices, which all finished last week lower
than they started, again fell across the board.
The situation was aggravated by the Chinese, who previously this year
emerged as big buyers and helped to support prices. Yesterday they changed
tactics, selling copper and aluminium, the LME's most heavily-traded metals.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
said metals had been 'whiplashed by a torrent of poor economic data' from
the US, Japan and by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development which said gross domestic product growth in member countries
would not exceed 1.5 per cent this year. It predicted 2.2 per cent growth at
the start of 1992. 'The past week is one in which the metal markets realised
that metal demand growth was not going to ride to the rescue,' he added.
'The onus is back squarely on metal producers. The choice is simple - cut
back refined metal output or spend another year in purgatory.'
According to Ms Lesley Campbell, trader at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda
natural resources group, there have been occasions in the past year when big
players in the LME's copper, aluminium and zinc markets provided price
support - 'more than the fundamentals have justified.' She added: 'Too many
blind eyes have been turned away from the fundamentals for too long.'
Zinc, which has been buoyed by an options-related technical squeeze for much
of this year, showed the biggest fall yesterday. Zinc for delivery in three
months was down nearly 3.5 per cent from Friday's close or by Dollars 44 a
tonne to Dollars 1,243.50.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Senate overrides Bush's veto of cable TV bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Senate yesterday overrode President George Bush's refusal to sign a
bill regulating the cable television industry in its first successful
challenge of the presidential veto since Mr Bush came into office. Congress
has failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed to overturn Mr Bush's
veto on 35 previous occasions.
Despite last-minute lobbying of senators by Mr Bush, the Senate voted by 74
to 25 with one abstention to back the legislation, which would empower the
Federal Communications Commission to set 'reasonable' rates for basic cable
services, except in the few districts where cable operators already face
competition.
The House was also due to vote on the legislation again, which it originally
passed by 280 votes to 128, or by more than the necessary two-thirds margin.
Since de-regulation in 1984 prices for basic cable services have risen by
more than 50 per cent. Broadcast television and consumer groups have mounted
extensive advertising campaigns backing the legislation and attacking what
they see as the cable companies' exploitation of monopoly positions in many
districts.
The tussle over the cable legislation had become a test of political
strength in the final weeks ahead of the US presidential election. While
debate over the issue sometimes cut across party lines, Mr Bush's opposition
to the bill allowed Democrats to paint him as siding with the interests of
the cable industry against the consumer.
However, Mr Bush opposed the legislation on the grounds that regulation of
the industry would push up, rather than cut, cable rates because of
provisions laying down service standards and requiring cable companies to
negotiate with broadcasting stations before carrying their signals. The
legislation would 'cost American jobs and discourage investment in
telecommunications,' he said.

The soldiers and gendarmes, under the command of President Mobutu Sese Seko,

assembly, which was dissolved six weeks ago by a pro-democracy conference.
Witnesses said troops also surrounded the Finance Ministry and continued to
guard Zaire's central bank, after taking up positions at the weekend to
support its sacked governor.
Defiant members of the pro-Mobutu parliament had scheduled a meeting for

Miller Group, one of the UK's largest private companies, has purchased the
second of the three main divisions of Conder Group, the construction company
which went into receivership last month, for an undisclosed sum.
Miller, Group, a family-run construction business has acquired Conder
Projects, which designs and constructs buildings to order.
At the weekend, Conder's receivers sold the company's steel fabricating
business for 'a significant seven figure sum' to another private company,
Melton Medes, run by Indian-born entrepreneur Mr Nathu Ram Puri.
The receivers are believed to be in advanced talks on the disposal of the
final of the three divisions, Conder IEI. It was the collapse of talks with
Seaboard, the power company, on the sale of this heating and ventilation
business that which eventually forced Conder into receivership.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WALL Steet was stunned last night at the unexpected resignation of Mr
Richard Braddock, president of Citicorp, the leading US bank that has been
struggling to bolster its capital.
An hour later, the bank also revealed it expects Dollars 870m (Pounds 513m)
of third-quarter write-offs in its consumer division. Citicorp, which
expects to earn between eight and 13 cents per share in the third quarter,
said it would take a Dollars 65m pre-tax restructuring charge.
Citicorp's brief official statement said Mr Braddock's departure was
effective immediately. 'Mr Braddock chose to resign after concluding that
his best contribution to the recovery of Citicorp's momentum has been
realised and, accordingly, he wants to pursue new career opportunities,'
Citicorp said.
Wall Street was especially surprised at the resignation as 50-year-old Mr
Braddock is a close friend and main aide-de-camp of Mr John Reed, Citicorp
chairman. Mr Reed and Mr Braddock have been seen as the joint stewards of
the bank's efforts to recover from its past loan losses and commercial
property problems.
Mr Reed does not plan to appoint a successor. 'The office of Citicorp
president will not be filled,' said Mr John Morris, bank spokesman.
His responsibilities will be be taken up by other senior managers.
Mr Braddock, who made his name at Citicorp as Mr Reed's main partner in the
drive to develop retail banking in the 1980s, was named to the president's
position in January 1990. Mr Reed had been criticised for having left the
job vacant since 1985, when he became chairman and chief executive.
Mr James McDermott, president of bank analysts Keefe Bruyette and Wood,
said: 'It's a shocker. The press release reads like pabulum and there must
be something behind it that we don't know. I just don't get it.'
Mr George Salem, banking analyst at Prudential Securities, speculated that
Mr Braddock's departure might have been related to pressure from US bank
regulators. Last summer it was revealed that Citicorp had bowed to pressure
from bank regulators and had signed a memorandum of understanding with the
Federal Reserve and the Comptroller of the Currency to accept closer
oversight by bank examiners.
Mr Salem said he considered it ironic that the Citicorp president should be
leaving 'because Braddock was a stronger manager than Reed'.

slide in the pound
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Irish government is to announce support measures today for exporters who
have been badly hit by sterling's continuing slide on the foreign exchange
markets, but Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, again ruled out
devaluation as a policy option.
Yesterday sterling fell to a new record low of Pounds 1.10 against the punt,
which prompted Mr Terry Hobdell, the chairman of the Irish Small Firms
Association (SFA), to say: 'This issue calls for immediate action by the
government. It is a serious crisis, not just for exporters but for
manufacturers who face the problem of much cheaper imports from the UK.'
He said the SFA is looking for a package of around IPounds 150-200m 'to
underwrite exporters and those facing competition from the UK'. The
government said IPounds 50m was to be made available, along with IPounds
25m, from EC structural funds. The package is expected to include direct
employment subsidies and selective reductions in employers' national
insurance contributions.
Although the financial markets anticipate a punt devaluation, all the main
economic lobby groups continue to back the defence of the punt, including
unions. A spokesman for SIPTU, Ireland's largest trade union, said
yesterday: 'Special supports for those worst-hit by sterling's weakness will
be cheaper and better for the country than devaluation.'

FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Bank of Spain tries to boost
peseta's image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday signalled its confidence in the peseta by
partially lifting exchange controls that it introduced last month and by
declining to raise interest rates.
The peseta rose from Pta70.5 (39p) to the D-Mark to Pta71.8 early yesterday
before stabilising at Pta71.5, clear of its Pta72.6 floor in the Exchange
Rate Mechanism (ERM).
The bank's decision to maintain its 13 per cent intervention rate at
yesterday's auction of certificates of deposit, failed to rally the markets.
By mid-morning the Madrid stock exchange had fallen 1.8 per cent to a new
low for the year. Exchange controls will remain in place on one- to
three-day swap operations with the peseta. Thus dealers selling pesetas
'short' will have to deposit (interest-free with the Bank of Spain for up to
a year), a sum equivalent to the day's transactions.
Some dealers believed that the measures were now more stringent than before
for those operating on the peseta's 'spot' market.
Restrictions were, however, lifted on all other currency operations. The
bank also lowered the obligatory deposit, proportional to the amount of
foreign currency held, that domestic institutions have to make with the Bank
of Spain.
'Before we were damaging those who were legitimately covering their currency
investments and now we are simply focusing on the speculators,' a spokesman
for the bank said.
A bank circular said the controls, which had been introduced 12 days ago at
a time of strong speculation on ERM currencies, were now being eased because
'the foreign exchange environment has since evolved towards greater
stability'.
The markets had widely anticipated that an easing of exchange controls would
be accompanied by a rise in interest rates. The authorities, however, are
apparently holding such a rise in reserve until there is a return to full
currency liberalisation.
The partial lifting earned a mixed reception. 'The authorities have
prudently streamlined the restrictions and are transmitting confidence,'
said Mr Jaime Pinies, chief analyst at Banco Santander de Negocios. Mr
Stephen Hughes, of Nikko Europe in London, said: 'No foreign investor is
going to come back into Spain until the controls are completely lifted. The
investors sense a peseta devaluation and view the currency as risky.'

FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: The British PM explains goals -
Major's letter to EC leaders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The following are key excerpts from the letter sent last Friday by Mr John
Major, UK prime minister, to other EC leaders. In it he explains why EC
finance ministers will not be present at next week's emergency summit
meeting in Birmingham. He also outlines the British presidency's goals.
'A number of colleagues have expressed willingness to have a general
discussion at Birmingham of the recent turbulence on the foreign exchanges
and about the lessons we need to draw.
'Some of you have, however, expressed concern that if finance ministers are
present that would arouse expectations of immediate decisions and could
itself create market instability. I am very happy to respond to that concern
and do not propose to invite finance ministers to join us. It would not be
credible, however, in the light of very dramatic and far-reaching events, to
have no discussion at all of these events when we meet.'
Mr Major said he wanted the summit to agree a declaration covering: greater
openness in the Community business; more consultation by the European
Commission before making proposals for legislation; steps to remove peoples'
concern at the loss of national identity by making a reality of the concept
of subsidiarity; greater involvement by national parliaments at an early
stage in Community decision-making; increasing the appeal of the Maastricht
treaty by showing how it affects the lives of ordinary people for the
better, for example greater freedom of movement, consular protection,
educational exchanges and an improved environment.
'The Community has been through a rocky patch,' Mr Major said. 'I believe
that at Birmingham we can give a new and united signal showing both that we
have responded to public opinion and how we will bring the Community closer
to the lives of our citizens.'

With the year-on-year inflation rate now running at 67.7 per cent, few

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (1): The
providers are beaming - New technology is beginning to deliver the choice
for television viewers that has long been forecast. If the global village

millions in the US, Asia and Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEXT month Britain will get a new general entertainment satellite television
channel, UK Gold, from the BBC and Thames television, and backed by Cox
Enterprises of the US.
Around the same time Deutsche Welle, the international German broadcaster,
starts a German language television service beamed in by satellite for north
and Latin America.
BBC World Service Television, already available in Asia and Africa, has just
achieved its first North American landfall in a deal with the Canadian
Broadcasting Corporation.
A few weeks later, two Hong Kong businessmen, Mr TT Tsui and Mr David Pang,
will launch a business and factual channel aimed at Europeans interested in
news of greater China - China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. The broadcasts will be
in English but there will be programme repeats in Mandarin and Cantonese.
A few examples from the list of new television developments planned for this
autumn suggests that after many delays, false starts and false promises the
new media of satellite and cable television technology are beginning to
deliver the choice that has long been forecast. If the global village
predicted by Marshall McLuhan has not arrived in its entirety, it is
becoming a reality for many millions.
The growth of 24-hours-a-day international television news services offered
by organisations such as Mr Ted Turner's Cable News Network (CNN), or the
BBC, is being matched by imaginative ventures to offer consumers an
unprecedented choice of entertainment.
The US media giant, Time Warner, has launched a 150-channel cable network in
New York with many of the extra channels given over to the staggered showing
of hit films on a pay-per-view basis. Subscribers are never more than 30
minutes away from the start of a film they want to see.
In Los Angeles, Hughes Communications are at work on a high power satellite
system capable of delivering 150 channels, using digital compression
techniques, to all of the US. Apart from broadcasting 20 channels to rural
areas with limited television choice, carrying big sports events not being
transmitted by the national networks, the project, DirectTv, will also
specialise in pay-per-view film box office with a selection of films
starting every 30 minutes.
Many ventures in the new media of communication are speculative and
loss-making, or require vast investment and equal faith, but there are now
enough success stories in many parts of the world to suggest that, in spite
of all the damaging hype, multi-channel television in all its forms is a
significant industry which will in time change the pattern of
communications.
Last year, according to CIT research, the London-based market research group
specialising in communications, satellite carriers such as Intersal,
Eutelsat and private groups such as SES, owners of the Astra satellite
system, earned around Dollars 600m, more than 55 per cent of it from
broadcast television. By 2001, CIT estimates the figure will have grown to
Dollars 3bn, although the proportion from television will probably drop.
Sale of satellite dishes is now the single most important product line for
Amstrad Consumer Electronics - a business worth around Pounds 150m a year to
the company. Amstrad claims a dominant position in the UK market with a
share of about 70 per cent, with Pace number two with more than 20 per cent.
Amstrad also claims leadership of the German market with a 35 per cent
share.
But it is Amstrad's third most important market which is more surprising. It
is Poland where the overall market is taking more than 250,000 satellite
dishes a year in spite of the country's financial problems.
One-metre satellite dishes adorn the balconies of Warsaw flats and it is a
very poor hotel that does not have Sky News, or CNN, plus channels such as
MTV, the pop music channel, Screen Sport or German language channels such as
RTL Plus.
According to a recent study by Carat, the international media buying
organisation, and Continental Research, the market research group, 39.2m
television households in western Europe will be able to receive channels
from the Astra satellite system, or 25 per cent of the total.
The two Astra satellites already in operation can broadcast 32 channels and
a third satellite with a further 16-channel capacity is due to be launched
next year. The main language groups on Astra are English and German,
although the organisation has recently signed a two-channel deal with Spain
with an option for two further channels.
Carat/Continental predict that by 2000 the number of homes capable of
receiving Astra channels will have risen to 72.6m out of the total of 152m
television homes - 65 per cent of them via cable network the rest using
satellite dishes.
The UK and Germany are at the moment the main markets for satellite
television in Europe. In Germany it is projected that no less than 83 per
cent of homes will be able to receive Astra channels.
In the UK satellite television continues to make progress. British Sky
Broadcasting, a consortium in which Pearson, owners of the Financial Times,
has a stake, says it is now available in around 2.5m homes - although some
estimates are lower - and around 1.5m subscribe to at least one of the two
premium movie channels. BSkyB recently caused controversy by outbidding ITV
for exclusive live rights to the new Premier football league in the UK. At
the beginning of this month the venture launched a third film channel, based
on films of the last 30 years, which will be available free to those who
subscribe to the two premium channels.
Modern multi-channel cable has been slow to develop in the UK but the number
of homes passed by the new networks and the number of subscribers continues
to grow. At the beginning of July - the most recent statistics - subscribers
to modern broadband systems rose to 330,630, a net increase of 13.5 per cent
over the previous three months, and a 72.5 per cent rise in the past year.
Cable building is pushing ahead in spite of the recession because of the
continued support of large North American players such as US West, TCI,
Southwestern Bell, Videotron and Bell Canada.
All of them increasingly see cable as not just a method of delivering extra
channels of television but at the same time offering telephone services.
The number of consumers who have signed up for telephones from their cable
companies, working mainly in association with Mercury Communications, is
still small in absolute terms. But the growth rates are starting to look
dramatic. In January 1991 in the UK there was a total of 2,224 cable
telephone lines. By this July the number had risen to 47,902 lines.
In spite of the growing number of satellite channels, cable has the
potential for much greater channel capacity and can target its services to
particular areas.
In cosmopolitan areas of cities cable operators can tailor their services
appropriately. Thus, Videotron, in its London franchises, is offering
multi-cultural programming at the weekends in the space left vacant when the
parliamentary channel closes down on Friday. The five segments will cover
programmes for London's Asian, Greek, Afro-Caribbean, Turkish and
Farsi-speaking population.
As conventional satellite and cable television channels are establishing
themselves, new kinds of interactive - or two-way television - are also on
the way.
Apart from pay-per-view and game shows where viewers can participate
directly, interactive television includes two-way video teleconferencing and
other forms of educational and business television.
Consultants, Frost &amp; Sullivan, believe that interactive television will be a
Dollars 1.65bn market in the US by 1996. 'Virtually every large company that
is involved in the fields of consumer electronics, television production,
television broadcasting, cable TV, professional video equipment,
telecommunications or computers - a high confluence of industries - see
interactive TV as the key to its future growth,' Frost &amp; Sullivan argues.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (3): Broadening
transmissions - Cable television in the UK is growing fast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY

<TEXT>
DURING the recent Barcelona Olympics cable television subscribers to
Videotron's London franchises were in a position to see more of the action
than anyone else.
The Canadian-owned company devoted four channels to the Games - in addition
to live coverage, Eurosport broadcast viewers could also watch events that
started four or eight hours previously so that they could choose sports in
which they were most interested. There was also immediate access to the
latest results on a scoreboard channel.
The Videoway service attracted 90 per cent of cable viewers at some time
over the Olympics and accounted for 40 per cent of viewing of Olympic
events.
'Videoway adds value and vindicates our intention to introduce interactive
television in the UK on a progressive basis starting towards the end of this
year,' says Mr Louis Brunel, managing director of Videotron Corporation
which holds franchises covering 1.2m homes in the UK.
The company plans to introduce an interactive roulette game where the viewer
will be able to play the game on the screen - at first just for chips but
perhaps later for prizes. Soon after subscribers will be able to choose
their own camera angles for sports such as ice hockey.
The developments are a small indication of how cable television is gradually
beginning to broaden from the days when there was little more than films,
sports, general entertainment and news.
Within the next few months some of the main London franchise holders will be
connected for the first time. It will create new programming possibilities
in the capital, help with marketing and selling advertising.
A segment of arts programming - Performance - is to be carried by the London
link and from December it will be used to deliver The Family Channel, a
successful, wholesome cable channel in the US available in more than 60m
homes.
The company behind it, International Family Entertainment, recently launched
a bid for TVS Entertainment, the south of England ITV company which has lost
its franchise.
UK Gold, a channel which can draw on the extensive programme libraries of
the BBC and Thames Television, will be launched on November 1.
There are also hopes in the cable industry that the Disney channel from the
US after looking at the European market for some years will finally take the
plunge.
In addition, decisions are imminent on UK Today, a new cable channel which
could require investment of Pounds 21m. The channel which would carry
daytime and life-style programming and regional sport would be financed by
the cable industry itself and managed by United Artists Programming, one of
the main suppliers of channels that are exclusive to cable networks.
The United Artists offering include The Children's Channel, Bravo, classic
movies, Discovery, the factual channel, The Learning Channel and, since
January this year, The Parliamentary Channel carrying uninterrupted,
unedited live coverage of the House of Commons.
The broadening of programmes from cable is an indication that the industry
is on the move even though progress has often been slow and uneven.
Every quarter the number of homes passed by the cable networks, and
therefore able to subscribe, continues to grow as does the number who
actually subscribe.
On July 1, the number of homes connected to broadband - or modern
multi-channel systems - rose to 330,630, a net increase of 39,000 or 13.5
per cent over the previous three months and of 139,000 or 72.5 per cent over
the past year.
The number of broadband homes passed totalled 1,567,559 giving a penetration
rate - the proportion of those actually subscribing out of those who can -
of 21.1 per cent, a figure that has been slowly sneaking up from 18.9 per
cent a year ago.
When upgraded relay systems, which used to carry the normal four broadcast
channels, are included there was a total of 552,105 cable homes at the
beginning of July.
While acknowledging the progress, Mr Jon Davey, director of cable at the
Independent Television Commission, is still disappointed at the speed of
development.
In February, Mr Davey forecast that another 850,000 homes would be passed by
cable this year. Now the total is more likely to be around 500,000.
Apart from the effects of the recession and uncertainty among some of the
big North American players earlier this year about the possible effects of a
Labour Government, there was one serious blow to cable development: Pacific
Telesis, one of the big US regional telephone companies that had been
enthusiastic backers of cable in the UK, suddenly announced it was pulling
out. Cable was a perfectly reasonable business but it had decided instead to
expand in mobile communications.
PacTel was one of the largest operators with stakes at the beginning of this
year in franchises covering nearly 1.5m homes.
Interest is being expressed in the various PacTel franchises but the sale
has inevitable caused a hiatus.
But other North American telephone companies such as Nynex, US West,
Southwestern Bell and Bell Canada and cable companies such as Videotron,
United Artists Cable, Comcast and CUC Cablevision are still pushing the
industry ahead.
A new player with ambitions has arrived in the shape of Singapore Telecom in
the Cambridge franchise and there are unconfirmed rumours of further Far
East interest.
There are also signs that banks are becoming more willing to lend money to
cable companies. Development so far has largely had to be through equity
finance.
Some in the industry now believe that with improving choice of programme
channels and a second stream of revenue opening up from providing telephone
services as well television, cable has at last reached a critical mass and
will soon have to be taken seriously.
'I am encouraged but I would like to see it developing faster than it is,'
commented the cautious Mr Davey.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (2): Pay TV
reaches for the sky - Raymond Snoddy looks at the UK's satellite television
venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's six-channel satellite television venture, British Sky Broadcasting,
is one of the most remarkable media news stories of the past decade.
It is remarkable for the number of subscribers it has signed up but equally
so for the enormity of what it has cost and the degree of controversy it has
aroused and the disputes over how well it is or is not doing.
What is clear, however, is that since the forced merger in November 1990 of
British Satellite Broadcasting and Sky Television the combined consortium is
the leading satellite pay television business in Europe with l5m
subscribers.
Canal Plus, the French pay television service, is far ahead with more than
3.5m subscribers but much of its enormous strength flows from controlling a
conventional national television channel. Among broadcasters using satellite
distribution BSkyB, a consortium in which Pearson, owners of the Financial
Times, has a significant stake, has more than twice as many subscribers as
its nearest rival FilmNet which broadcasts to the Scandinavian countries and
Belgium and The Netherlands.
Earlier this year BSkyB, in co-operation with the BBC, turned up the heat
when it outbid ITV with a Pounds 304m offer for five-year exclusive rights
to live coverage of the new Premier football league.
There were allegations of skulduggery in the negotiations, complaints to the
Office of Fair Trading, and worries that the league would suffer from the
lack of visibility involved in taking games off national television. It is
not yet clear whether recorded highlights on the BBC would be an adequate
substitute, in terms of generating interest, for live games available to the
whole population.
But if there is doubt about the long-term impact on the Premier league of
moving to satellite television there is very little about the effects on
BSkyB. The agreement has enabled the consortium to turn Sky Sports into a
subscription channel at Pounds 5.99 a month although there were Pounds 2.99
special offers for the first year.
BSkyB already has attracted 950,000 satellite subscribers to Sky Sports and
an estimated 110,000 on cable. Because of the discounting, the financial
model is complex but already Sky Sports is getting close to break-even.
Scrambling Sky Sports so that it is only available to those who pay is a
clear indication of the way the venture, and probably many of the other
satellite channels, is moving. While satellite channels will, of course, try
to raise as much advertising revenue as they can it is a business that will
be based firmly on subscription revenues.
It is now obvious, that at least in the UK, the charging structure of
satellite television, will ape that of cable with a charges for a 'basic
tier' of channels. Everything else will be a la carte with discounts for
those who take most of the premium channels.
Until September, the BSkyB channels have been 'free' apart from the
subscription channels. Discussions are now at an advanced stage with United
Artists programming to try to put together a basic tier of channels,
including Sky One and Sky News, and channels such as Discovery, the
documentary channel, Bravo, the classic films channel, and The Children's
channel. Negotiations are still continuing on the precise financial terms
but other channels may yet also decide to join the loose federation. The aim
is to launch the new basic tier next October at a monthly charge of Pounds
2.99.
If possible BSkyB would like to keep the cost of access to all the available
channels to Pounds 19.99 a month which is seen as a significant threshold.
If they go too far above that there could be consumer resistance.
No-one knows what the effect will be of scrambling and charging for all the
channels. At the moment the satellite dish universe is rising at monthly
rates of 50,000 to 80,000 depending on the time of year.
If that rate of increase can be maintained after the introduction of full
subscription packages then satellite television will become a very
profitable business in the UK.
Since March, BSkyB has been profitable at the trading level and a Pounds 50m
operational profit is expected for this year. This figure does not include
the vast sums invested by Mr Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation and other big
investors such as Granada, Pearson and Chargeurs. It could be many years
before they get their money back although some City analysts looking at the
subscription revenue flows are saying the company could be worth between
Pounds 2bn to Pounds 3bn.
Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, says he is determined to keep the
satellite company competitive and will offer however many channels it takes,
in ventures with others, to try to ensure BSkyB is a 'must purchase'.
On October 1, Sky launched a third film channel to replace the Comedy
Channel which was not a success. The channel of films from the past 30 years
will be available free to those who take both premium film channels.
No precise numbers are available for the size of the satellite universe
mainly because at the beginning all the channels were available free and
therefore there were no subscriber bills to provide a check.
BSkyB says it has 1.5m subscribers taking at least one premium film channel
with 81 per cent taking both. The company believes it is available direct
via satellite dishes to a total of 2.6m homes apart from cable television.
These estimates are in line with independent market research by Continental
Research based on monthly interviews. Official figures from the Broadcasting
Audience Research Board are lower and a six-monthly study by another market
research group gives figures that are even lower.
In June, Continental put the dish universe at 2.423m, Barb at 2.208, and GFK
1.77m, which, if correct, would give an astonishingly high proportion of
subscribers to non-subscribers. The new channels take about 30 per cent of
viewing in satellite homes.
Zenith Media Worldwide, the media buying group, believes that by 2003 cable
television will rival dishes in the UK as a means of distributing new
channels. Overall by then the total household penetration of the new
channels in the UK will, Zenith forecasts, reach 73 per cent.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (5): Programmes
in their mother tongue - Joel Kibazo views the growing number of channels
aimed at ethnic minorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE growth of satellite television in the UK over the past two years has
allowed the expansion of channels directly targeted at ethnic minorities.
The new channels not only offer tailor-made programmes for communities which
felt ignored by mainstream television, but also broadcast in mother
languages. This new wave now includes stations broadcasting in Arabic, Hindi
and Japanese.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, a 10-year satellite broadcasting licence is
issued more or less on request by the Independent Television Commission
(ITC), provided the applicant meets ITC guidelines laid down by the ITC
codes.
The cost of application and the first year's licence fee comes to Pounds 381
and unlike in the recent allocation of franchises for the ITV network, there
is no quality threshold for satellite broadcasters.
Mr Jon Davey, director of cable and satellite at the ITC, said: 'I think it
is a good thing for those minorities that are not currently provided for.'
One of the new licensees is TV Asia. Launched last August it is aimed at the
1.3m people in Britain of Asian origin. It is not the first station for the
Asian community. Several services on cable have come and gone; one of the
survivors is Asia Vision, which remains popular with London's Bengali
community.
However, TV Asia, set up with an Pounds 8m budget, is the first to be
transmitted via satellite (though it is also available on selected cable
systems) and has already quickly established a high profile.
Broadcast in two blocks via the Comedy Channel and Sky One, both on the
Astra satellite, TV Asia offers a mix of news, current affairs and light
entertainment and draws heavily on the ready supply of Indian films from the
sub-continent. Hindi, Urdu and English are the main broadcast languages,
with special programmes broadcast in Punjabi, Gujarati, Bengali, and Tamil.
The potpourri of languages is having some unexpected results: the emergence
of 'Hinglish', a hybrid of English and Hindi, which already features in many
Hindi pop songs and big screen films produced in India.
Backed by a consortium from Pakistan and India, the station draws its
revenue from subscription (handled by Sky's subscription department) and
advertising.
Charging Pounds 11.99 for a monthly subscription, it claims to have signed
up 12,000 subscribers in the first month and says it is likely to break even
within a year.
Mr Faisal Sherjan, chief executive, claims the station is going for
'quality' programming, a claim loudly dismissed by some viewers who describe
the programmes as the TV equivalent of 'heavily diluted curry'. Needless to
say, it is this scheduling based on the lowest common denominator approach
which holds out the greatest commercial potential, a fact which the station
founders acknowledge. Mr Sherjan said: 'The Asian community is an affluent
community which does not spend its money in pubs and clubs. They are also
big buyers of video cassette players and videos and we can offer the kind of
product they want.' The channel also hopes to reach Asian communities in
Germany, Scandinavia, and the Benelux countries.
While TV Asia's target audience only extends to western Europe, Middle East
Broadcasting Centre, launched in September 1991, provides family
entertainment, films, current affairs and international news for Arabic
speakers in the UK, Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
MBC plans to start beaming programmes to the US within the next few months.
Backed by businessmen in Saudi Arabia, MBC broadcasts 9 1/2 hours a day with
programmes transmitted via satellites operated by Eutelsat and Arabsat. It
claims a potential audience of more than 100m people and its chief executive
expects it to break even after five years.
In spite of MBC's ambitious global aspirations the distinction of being the
first pan-Europe, non-European language channel was achieved by Japan
Satellite Television (JSTV), launched two years ago.
Aimed at the Japanese expatriate community in Europe, which mostly consists
of middle and senior management, it broadcasts daily between 7pm and 6am on
Astra 1b (also known as the children's channel), and draws its menu of news,
general entertainment, drama and educational programmes from both NHK,
Japan's public broadcasting corporation, and commercial stations. A
particular feature is the simultaneous broadcasting of news and current
affairs programmes from Japan to Europe, though at Pounds 30 a month,
subscription is above the average for satellite services.
In spite of the growing number of satellite stations, services continue to
be launched on cable and in some cases in more imaginative forms. One such
station is the Multicultural Televison launched last month by Videotron, the
UK's fourth largest cable operator.
The five-hour service broadcasts only in London on Saturday and Sunday
evenings on the parliamentary channel and its schedule is a mix of
programmes to cater for London's Asian, Greek, Turkish Afro-Caribbean and
Iranian community.
Not all minority channels are directly targeted at their own communities.
Next month sees the launch of China News Europe, backed by Hong Kong tycoon
TT Tsui and businessman David Tang.
Based in London, CNE plans to broadcast news and business programmes from
China, Taiwan and Hong Kong. Programmes will be primarily in English, though
repeated in Mandarin and Cantonese. Ms Betty Yao, general manager of CNE, is
adamant about her target audience. 'Our primary audience is English-speaking
business people with an interest in greater China. We are not an ethnic
station,' she said.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (4): Intervention
rocks the airwaves - Traditional broadcasters are facing changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's traditional broadcasters are in turmoil as government intervention
and an increasingly competitive market begin to challenge what they do, how
they do it and above all how much it costs.
The ITV network will over the next year be coming to terms with the
provisions of the 1990 Broadcasting Act and the competitive tenders for new
franchises which begin on January 1, 1993.
The date will mark the beginning of a new era in British commercial
television, with new companies, unparalleled pressure to reduce costs and a
much greater emphasis on ratings.
ITV could be about to face one of the most difficult years in its history.
The unexpected length and depth of the advertising recession will put all
budgets under pressure. The advertising revenue growth forecasts of bidders
for new franchises averaged around 4 per cent a year in real terms over the
next 10 years.
Some forecasters such as consultants Booz Allen now believe the more likely
figure will be between 1 per cent and 2 per cent. National Economic Research
Associates, which has been more bullish in the past, warned in a recent
survey that confidence was lower than normal at this time of the year and
that little real growth was expected for 1992 compared with last year.
ITV is not, however, about to go into a serious decline - advertising
agencies predict net revenues of Pounds 1.8bn for this year. Yet potential
instability could arise because of the particular problems faced by a number
of companies which bid high to defeat serious opponents. In addition to
having to pay large amounts of money to the Treasury companies such as HTV,
the licence holders for Wales and the West and Yorkshire Television, which
merged with Tyne Tees earlier this year have tended to lose market share as
advertising revenue flowed towards the Midlands, London and the south.
An additional area of uncertainty arises from the fact that from the
beginning of 1993 Channel 4 will sell its advertising competitively with ITV
instead of, as at present, being funded by a set percentage of ITV
advertising revenue.
The BBC has also come into the firing line as the long debate begins on the
re-negotiation of its Royal Charter in 1996.
To improve efficiency the corporation has set up a system of Producer Choice
under which producers will have the freedom to go to the outside market for
services if they want to, a measure that is clearly likely to reduce staff
employment.
The corporation is also moving towards a competitive strategy of providing
'distinctive' programmes and not competing against every aspect of
commercial and satellite television.
'The BBC will need to withdraw from areas in which it is no longer able or
needed to make an original contribution,' is how the organisation puts it
although it is not yet clear what its 'higher ground' programme philosophy
will mean in practice.
Making the BBC the 'National Theatre of the airwaves' was another objective
set out in recently leaked documents. Yet the BBC is determined to remain in
all the main genres of programme-making including comedy and light
entertainment.
A clearer idea of what lies in store for the BBC will come later this month
when the government publishes a green paper or discussion document on the
future of the corporation.
All the signs are that the government believes there is a role for a public
service broadcaster like the BBC well into the next century and that a
universal licence fee is still the best method of funding. Considerable
pressure is likely to be applied to ensure that the BBC is as efficient as
possible.
In spite of the uncertainty and sometimes near hysteria surrounding the
BBC's future the corporation is busy carving out a role for itself in the
new media.
BBC World Service Television runs 24-hours-a-day satellite channels in Asia
and Africa and plans to span the globe. Quite separately the BBC is in talks
with Sky Television looking into the possibility of a joint 24-hour news
service for the UK.
On November 1 the BBC and Thames Television, which has lost its ITV
franchise, will launch UK Gold, an advertising-financed general
entertainment.
The channel will be scheduled mainly from the libraries of Thames and the
BBC and will include drama, soap opera, comedy and films. There will be no
news, sport or current affairs.
The channel in which Thames will have 15 per cent plus a 5 per cent option
and the BBC 20 per cent is a further sign of a growing secondary market in
programmes which have already been shown on the main broadcast channels.
In September, BBC Enterprises, the commercial arm of the corporation, signed
a 10-year deal with UK Gold for around 1,500 hours of programmes a year.
'This agreement represents further progress in turning UK Gold into a
reality. Exclusive access to BBC and Thames programming is the heart of the
channel, enabling it to offer classic British-made entertainment to the
satellite television audience,' BBC Enterprises said.
The BBC would eventually like to be involved in as many as five satellite
channels offering everything from documentaries and wildlife to children's
programmes as long as suitable partners can be found.
ITV is also starting to think about the possibility of launching its own UK
Gold channel on satellite, a channel with the working title of ITV2.
Research is under way and ITV is due to take a decision on whether or not to
become directly involved in satellite television within the next few weeks.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (6): Telephones
provide staying power - Raymond Snoddy checks the loyalty of cable
subscribers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE numbers in Mr Larry Carlton's survey of the effect of offering telephone
services on the loyalty of cable television were small but the results
dramatic all the same.
Mr Carlton is president of TeleWest the joint venture between
TeleCommunications Inc, the US cable television operator, and US West, the
American telephone company and the largest single cable company in the UK.
He wanted to do a basic check on the anecdotal evidence that cable
subscribers who take a telephone service as well as conventional cable
television are much less prone to 'churn'. The term is industry jargon for
subscribers who are disconnected either because they no longer want to pay
or because they have simply moved house. Churn is the bane of the industry
and can reach levels as high as 35 per cent a year which means as cable
networks are built the search is always on for new subscribers not only to
add to the existing total but to replace those who have been lost.
TeleWest looked at 100 cable television-only subscribers in its London south
franchise who were connected last year. By the end of the year only 55 were
still hooked up.
The small study then looked at 92 subscribers who had both cable television
and a telephone service linked through the cable network to Mercury
Communications, the Cable and Wireless rival to British Telecom. All 92 were
still subscribing a year later.
'I didn't want to believe it. I asked my executive did he hand-pick them,'
said Mr Carlton with a laugh.
The results illustrate in a dramatic way the marriage of cable television
and telecommunications services that is starting to happen all over the UK
from Edinburgh, through Birmingham and the Midlands and Avon to London and
the south coast and areas such as Portsmouth and Brighton. Next year the
places where cable telephone services will start to become available will
include Newcastle, Blackburn and Liverpool.
The increasingly close link between cable television and telecommunications
is symbolised by the link between TCI and US West itself.
'We are each trying to learn each other's technology,' says the TeleWest
executive. In most cases where telephone services are being offered or are
about to be offered the franchise investors include North American telephone
companies, including Nynex and South Western Bell as well as US West and
Bell Canada.
The involvement by cable companies in providing telecommunication services
goes back only a few years to the days when a small number of operators led
by The Cable Corporation started installing telephone lines. Apart from good
quality circuits the main advantage on offer was discounts averaging between
10 and 15 per cent. The demand was much greater than expected and telephone
earnings started to outstrip those from conventional television channels.
Quite apart from the prospects for reducing churn, cable companies are also
finding it easier to market their services when they can offer the
combination of television channels and telephone services complete with
special discounts for those who take both.
Some consumers see extra television channels as a discretionary purchase,
perhaps even a bit of self-indulgence but the possibility of 15 per cent off
their telephone bills is viewed in a much more practical manner.
Depending on use, the savings on telephone bills could cover the cost of the
extra television channels.
It has now become conventional wisdom that the way forward is to offer
combined television and telephone packages from the start.
TeleWest, for example, is planning to construct 2,000 miles of cable network
next year which will make the service available to a further 375,000 homes.
East London Telecommunications, which owns six cable franchises in the
London area covering about 630,000 homes and is now controlled by BCE
Telecom International, a subsidiary of Bell Canada, plans to launch a large
construction initiative in December offering a combined telephone and
television service in the London borough of Redbridge.
Videotron, the Canadian cable company which has 69,500 cable subscribers in
the UK and only 2,500 residential and 1,000 business telephone subscribers
in its Southampton franchise, has now decided to pause and go back to its
existing south London networks to add telecom capacity.
As a result the company will reduce its annual rate of construction to
35,000 new homes passed a year instead of the present figure of more than
100,000.
The case for upgrading is simply made out by the figures. It will cost
Videotron around Pounds 80 to Pounds 90 a home to upgrade existing networks
but telephony revenue will almost equal the cable figure of around Pounds
200 a year.
Mr Bill Aitken, cable operator marketing manager for Mercury, has seen the
change in attitude to cable telephones services at first hand.
Eighteen months ago he was selling a few lines a month to the cable
industry. Now the figure is running at around 10,000 a month.
Official figures from the Independent Television Commission, the industry
regulatory body, show that from the beginning of January 1991 the number of
cable lines has grown from 2,224 to 47,902 on July 1 this year.
Mr Aitken believes the actual number is larger and the rate of increase is
rising. It is limited mainly by the rate at which the cable industry can
construct its networks. By 1994 there could be more than 300,000 cable
telephone lines in place.
For Mercury, cable gives important access to the local loop which is
otherwise totally dominated by BT although further competition is on the
way.
Cable operators are already starting to suggest penetration rates - the
ratio of homes passed by the cable network to those actually subscribing -
of 40 per cent for television services and 25 per cent for telephone
services.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (9): Battle over
regulation - Developments in North America reviewed by Patrick Harverson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGULATION has been the dominant issue in the US cable television industry
this year, or to be more precise, re-regulation.
The cable television industry was deregulated in the mid-1980s under the
1984 Cable Act, but last month the House of Representatives and the Senate
voted by overwhelming majorities to pass a bill that will re-impose rate
regulation on basic cable television providers who face no competition from
other multi-channel TV services. The bill is also designed to stimulate
competition against cable-TV monopolies.
The legislation attracted enormous publicity. The cable industry, backed by
some powerful Hollywood production companies, conducted a huge lobbying
campaign against the bill, while the consumer groups and cable competitors
(such as network television broadcasters and providers of satellite and
microwave services) who initiated or supported the legislation worked
equally hard to ensure its safe passage through Congress.
The debate on regulating cable was also aired in scores of newspapers, and
via television screens where cable providers ran anti-regulation
advertisements aimed at persuading viewers to lobby their Congressmen to
stop the legislation. Even sports fans could not escape: one commentator,
working for a powerful cable company, voiced strong opinions on the industry
regulation in the middle of a baseball game last month.
The president, in the heat of a fierce election battle, has also been
involved in the controversy. After the House vote he attacked the bill as
full of 'costly, burdensome and unnecessary requirements', and promised to
veto it, suggesting Congress would better serve the consumer by 'promoting
vigorous competition, not massive re-regulation'.
A presidential veto, however, is unlikely, given that Congress has the
required two-thirds (plus one) majority among senators and representatives
to override the veto. Mr Bush is proud that his veto has never been
overriden during his term of office, and it is improbable that he would
accept the humiliation of defeat by Congress so close to the election,
especially over an issue that is not particularly close to his heart and
that is popular with voters.
The bill is an ambitious attempt by consumer groups to place restrictions on
prices for basic cable services, and open up the local monopolies that many
cable providers enjoy to competition from outside.
Over the years, consumer advocates have been critical of the price and
quality of cable services. Figures show that cable rates have risen by 60
per cent, many times the rate of inflation since 1986. At the same time,
cable providers are monopolies in most cities, and subscribers have long
complained of the poor service they receive for their money.
The present legislation is aimed primarily at 'basic' cable services, which
are the broadcast, government, public, educational channels and the
so-called 'superstations'. These include TBS, part of Ted Turner's media
empire, which owns a host of cable channels including the Discovery and
Family Channels, TWX, part of Time Warner and owner of the greatly-watched
Home Box Office (HBO) and Cinemax movie channels, and VIA, owner of MTV, its
music counterpart VH-1, and several other popular channels.
Rate regulation would be the responsibility of the Federal Communications
Commission, the government's broadcasting watchdog, which would regulate
basic rates wherever local authorities fail to, or cannot, set guidelines of
their own.
Additionally, the bill will bar cable programming affiliates from refusing
to sell programmes to cable competitors, and bar local franchising
authorities from issuing exclusive cable TV franchises. It will also allow
over-the-air broadcasters (such as the big networks) to negotiate with local
cable operators for fees, promotions, channel positioning and other
considerations. Under the present law, cable operators get over-the-air
broadcast signals for free.
In spite of all the controversy surrounding re-regulation, industry
observers believe that if the cable business is to be regulated once more,
the bill Congress has passed is the least restrictive legislation cable
companies could have hoped for. 'It's a liveable bill,' says Jessica Reif,
cable industry analyst with broking house Oppenheimer in New York. 'Nobody
ever wants to be regulated, but it is not a tough bill and at least it gets
all the uncertainty out of the way.'
So why did the opponents of the bill make so much fuss? Their argument
against it was relatively simple: re-regulation would push up cable
companies' costs significantly, and those higher costs would have to be
passed on to the consumer in the form of higher subscription rates. In
private, cable providers feared losing valuable monopolies, and were
especially concerned about competition from big telephone companies, who
want to offer television programmes and other electronic information
services over their communications networks.
Yet the cable industry also tried to block the bill because of an inherent
fear of any kind of regulation. In the early days of the bill's drafting it
was particularly nervous about how far the legislators would go, and indeed,
the bill that was eventually passed was a watered down version of the one
originally proposed in the Senate earlier this year.
The best indication of how restrictive the new bill will be for cable
companies came from the stock market, which took the news of the bill's
passage through Congress in late September with a remarkable degree of
equanimity. This sober response suggested investors regard the bill as
little threat to cable companies, at least for now, and it contrasted with
the big sell-off in cable stocks that followed the first House vote on
re-regulation in July.
Even if the new bill is relatively mild, cable companies will face fresh
competition as the 1990s progress. In June the FCC voted to allow broadcast
networks (ABC, CBS, NBC) to buy local cable television systems, ending a
22-year old ban. The new FCC ruling, however, carried restrictions aimed at
preventing the big networks from putting local broadcasting stations out of
business.
Even with greater competition, the future remains bright for cable companies
in the US. One avenue with particular potential is pay-per-view television -
where the cable subscriber pays a one-off fee to watch a special event or
programme. Since 1988 revenues from pay-per-view have more than doubled to
Dollars 388m. More than 18m homes in the US are able to order pay-per-view,
and industry observers forecast that figure to reach 32m homes, paying as
much as Dollars 1bn, by 1995.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (7): Underground
connections - Alice Rawsthorn examines developments in continental Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR more than a decade President Francois Mitterrand's governments have
unveiled Les Grands Plans for everything from architectural monuments to
modernising France's airline industry. But none of his schemes has backfired
quite so noisily as Le Plan Cable.
Ten years ago, when the French government unveiled its ambitious plans for
developing the cable television system, it painted a rosy picture of
technological progress and wider cultural choice with at least 1.25m
households subscribing to cable by the end of this year.
Le Plan Cable is running well below expectations with just over 800,000
French homes connected to cable. There is no shortage of scapegoats. There
have been damaging disputes over technology. Canal Plus, the dynamic pay-TV
station, has coaxed subscribers away from cable. The television market is so
over-crowded that La Cinq, one of the terrestrial channels, filed for
bankruptcy earlier this year. But the fact remains that, so far, President
Mitterrand's Le Plan Cable has been a flop.
Over the border in Belgium, the picture is very, very different. At a time
when France's fledgling cable system is struggling to establish itself, the
Belgians are tussling with the opposite problem of adapting to life in a
mature market.
Belgium has the highest penetration level of cable television in western
Europe with 88 per cent of all households plugged into a network. The
penetration level is still rising, but very slowly. The Belgian operators
are now concentrating on upgrading their existing systems from 300MHz to
450MHz formats so that they can carry more channels, thereby boosting their
revenue.
The contrast between the condition of the French and Belgian cable systems
could not be more marked, but it is indicative of the broader picture across
the rest of Western Europe. There are now around 70m 'cable homes' in the
region, which means nearly half of all households are connected to cable
television.
The latest study by CIT, the London-based communications research
consultancy, suggests that the number of wired homes in western Europe had
reached 67.9m by the beginning of this year, an increase of 8 per cent over
the same period in 1991. But the level of penetration varies from country to
country - from Belgium with 88 per cent to Italy, Spain and Portugal where
cable usage is still negligible.
After Belgium, the most mature market is the Netherlands, where 5m
households are connected. Dutch operators, like their Belgian counterparts,
are investing heavily in upgrading their systems to 20- or 30-channel
formats.
Germany is the largest market with more than 10m homes, just under a third
of households, subscribing to cable. However, the German market, which began
expanding at about the same time as the French market in the early 1980s, is
still growing rapidly.
The number of cable homes rose from 8.1m at the beginning of 1991 to 9.8m by
the start of this year, according to CIT's research. Most subscribers are
concentrated in the old German lander, where more than half of all
households are connected to cable.
DBP Telekom, the telecommunications group which has led the development of
cable in Germany, is adopting a similarly ambitious approach to cabling the
new lander. Telekom's target is to increase the number of homes in these
areas with access to cable from 183,000 to more than 800,000 in the course
of this year.
Meanwhile, the French government has desperately been trying to breathe new
life into its flagging cable system. Earlier this year it launched a new
Plan Cable offering special price-cutting incentives to new subscribers and
abolishing the law whereby private landlords could prevent their tenants
from installing cable.
France Telecom, the state-controlled telecommunications group which has
provided cable technology to private sector operators, has slashed its
leasing fees. However, the cable system is still struggling and, in spite of
the operators' promotional efforts, the 'churn' rate of people cancelling
their subscriptions is still uncomfortably high.
Sweden is also trying to revitalise its system, which covers 1.8m homes, by
relaxing controls. The Swedish cable market was deregulated at the start of
this year. Operators no longer need to be licensed by Kabelnamnden, the
regulatory authority, and the ban on local channels accepting advertising
has been abolished.
Meanwhile, Spain is starting to establish a legal cable service. Pirate
community video systems surfaced all over southern and eastern Spain in the
1980s and are now thought to cover more than 1m households. The government
is finalising proposals for an official system of localised independent
networks and 'super networks' which will encompass several towns.
Spain is seen as one of the main growth markets for cable, as are Italy,
Portugal and Greece, where the governments have been less active at tabling
legislation, but are likely to accelerate their efforts over the long term.
However, these southern European markets may be slow to take off and, in the
short term, CIT expects Germany, France and the UK to provide much of the
cable industry's growth in the mid and late 1990s. It forecasts steady
growth for the western European market throughout the decade with the number
of cable homes rising from 26.4m to 44.7m, or from 18 per cent to 27 per
cent of all households.
In spite of this expansion, the market is expected to remain confused and
fragmented. The structure of the cable industry varies so much from country
to country that pan-European channels, notably MTV, the pop video station,
and the Screensport sports service, still face an administrative minefield
of negotiating different deals in each market.
This scenario is unlikely to change, however quickly the market expands.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (8): A minefield
of uncertainty - Simon Davies reviews the complex and challenging Asian
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS somewhat ironic that Asia's only pan-continental satellite
broadcaster, was born and bred in Hong Kong, and nourished with the colony's
capital, yet it is scarcely watched there. The reason is one of the factors
that makes regional broadcasting in Asia such a minefield of uncertainty:
regulation.
Since Star Television, a joint venture between Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa
and its controlling shareholder Mr Li Ka-shing, commenced broadcasting in
1991, its focus has slowly shifted from the main market on which it had been
expected to concentrate, south-east Asia, and on to the poorer
sub-continent. In many cases, this is because it has had no choice.
In Malaysia, satellite broadcasting has been effectively banned; in
Singapore, the only access is through programme sales to the terrestrial
broadcasters; in Hong Kong, regulations on subscription and Cantonese
broadcasting have restricted viewing; while in Korea, it has sparked a whole
debate over cultural imperialism.
In fact there are only three markets where Star's regional broadcasting can
be considered to have made a substantial impact: India, Taiwan and Israel,
which account for 90 per cent of the 3.03m validated homes capable of
watching Star. Of these markets, Taiwan was the only expected success.
The attractions of satellite broadcasting in the Asian continent are
obvious. Star's five channels are transmitted by the AsiaSat 1 satellite,
which has two footprints, one covering Japan and China, the other stretching
from Indonesia to Turkey: they cover a population of 2.75bn, or more than
half the world's people.
Asia contains many of the fastest-growing economies in the world and it is a
region where most viewers are subjected to minimal choice from terrestrial
broadcasters.
In India, for example, the government channels have long been lambasted by
the world's second most populated nation. The reaction to Star has been
apocalyptic and the broadcaster has already spawned more than 10,000 cable
television operators, providing a validated audience of 1.3m homes. Star
claims this will exceed 2m by the end of the year.
The attractions of Asia have not gone unnoticed internationally. CNN has
recently moved to use Indonesia's Palappa satellite and there is talk of the
Australasian broadcasters launching regional services.
Groups such as Time Warner and Millicom have also been attracted to the
region and are discussing broadcasting plans. But most of the Asian
satellites are more oriented towards telecommunications than television and
none can offer the range of AsiaSat's footprint to provide regional
competition.
Japan already has broadcasting on the two KU-band Japan Communications
Satellites, but transmission only spills over to Korea and Taiwan and
separate dishes would be required to receive both JCSat and AsiaSat, since
the latter broadcasts on C-band.
Further C-band channels are to be launched in Thailand, while plans are
being discussed in Malaysia, South Korea and Pakistan, but these will all be
primarily localised broadcasting, compared with Star's BBC news service,
international sport, general entertainment, MTV and Mandarin channels.
Since Asia represents a very difficult market, because it offers no
homogeneity of language, culture, regulations, or spending patterns, new
local satellite channels should primarily complement the regional
broadcasters.
Star is offering a free-to-air service, relying almost exclusively on
advertising revenue. Potential annual advertising revenue, assuming full
utilisation at current prices, would amount to Dollars US872m. At present it
is believed to be getting less than 10 per cent of that, although it has
picked up substantial accounts such as Nike and Coca Cola.
But while advertisers are not over the moon about the opportunities offered
by Star, there is growing confidence that it represents an extremely
exciting long-term medium.
'Our view is that Star is going to be a major player in the Asian broadcast
scene,' argued Mr Garry Brown, media director of Leo Burnett. 'The thing
that has overcome our initial scepticism is not what has happened in the
last 12 months, but what will happen in the next five years,' he said.
He sees it offering new channels which will provide a more focused audience,
but it will also shake up the existing broadcasters and force them to
improve their product.
Star has been forced to take a flexible approach in expanding distribution.
In Singapore it will provide some programming for cable TV, while in the
Philippines, one of the television channels has started re-broadcasting
Star's MTV channel.
In India, it has effectively sub-leased a transponder to an outside operator
which is launching a mass market Hindi channel, to capitalise on Star's
successes in India.
But wherever is has been launched, it is acting as a catalyst both in the
quality of programming on offer, and in the regulatory environment.
It has effectively forced Asian governments to focus on issues such as the
intrusion of foreign language and foreign culture and to develop
broadcasting policies which reflect global advances.
Mr John Ure, research associate at the Hong Kong University, argued that
'even if wasn't inevitably for reasons such as the difficulty of policing
and the march of technology, the demand from within these countries is going
to require greater flows of information and programming'.
At present Star is relying principally on cable distribution to create its
audience. Given the lack of competition, it has succeeded in building up
close relationships with the operators. However, as satellite broadcasting
gains greater acceptance in Asia, competition is inevitable.
At present, Star has exclusivity rights to AsiaSat 1, with six transponders
on each footprint. It will be aided by the latest digital compression and
encription technology, which will enable broadcasters to offer more than one
channel per transponder and to scramble the broadcast to beat the pirates
and make it a more attractive option for programme sellers.
AsiaSat 2 will offer further potential for expansion. The second satellite
is due to be launched in 1994. It is not known whether Star will enjoy the
exclusivity rights it took for broadcasting from the first satellite. But
even if another broadcaster were to use the satellite, this would further
establish AsiaSat as the obvious choice for cable operators.
The costs of setting up a satellite are also fairly prohibitive - Star had
an initial budget of Dollars US300m - while the medium's track record in
Europe is likely to substantially restrict the number of new entrants.
In spite of these difficulties, Star accepts that competition is inevitable.
But with more than 2bn potential viewers, there is clearly room for a number
of niche operators.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Survey on Cable and Satellite Broadcasting (11): Indian TV
is looking up - Shiraz Sidhva on a revolution in screen entertainment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHIRAZ SIDHVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT A BAR in downtown Bombay, hundreds of teenagers swing and sing along to
the music of MTV, seeing wild images on the Indian television set that had
otherwise censored even a kiss.
In New Delhi, the main topic of discussion at a ladies' card party is what
happens next in the two soaps that have most of urban India hooked  - The
Bold and the Beautiful and Santa Barbara.
And the drab images and stale news of the nine o'clock news on state-owned
television has been upstaged by the BBC's slick news coverage on the hour.
Satellite television has taken India by storm, and it is only a year since
Hong Kong's Star (Satellite Television Asian Region) TV first beamed its
test channel to a country where television viewers had never had the luxury
of switching channels.
A recent survey by the Hong Kong-based market research firm, Frank Small and
Associates, shows that India is Star's biggest viewer (other countries in
the the satellite footprint include Hong Kong, Israel, Korea, Pakistan,
Philippines and Taiwan), with 1,282,500 homes having access to the network
by June 1992. This is a phenomenal increase of 211 per cent over Star TV's
access to only 412,500 homes in January this year, making Star's marketing
team who visited India last month confident that the network grows in India
by 5,800 homes a day.
Even a year ago, government officials who controlled the state-owned
Doordarshan had dismissed the satellite and cable invasion, saying that only
the very rich would be able to afford it, and they had access to video
anyway.
Today, the short-sighted attitude of government officials, who felt they
knew best what Indians should watch, has meant that fewer people are
watching the dull entertainment and political propaganda that Indian
television has been dishing out since the late Sixties, when a national
television network was established in the country.
Star TV offers four 24-hour channels - the entertainment Star Plus, BBC's
Asia Service, Prime Sports, and music videos on MTV. Most cable operators
who sell Star by subscription (the average monthly rate is Rs120 (Pounds 2))
offer an extra cable channel showing popular Hindi cinema, which is still
the largest draw for Indian audiences.
Perceiving this, and realising the vast advertising potential that India has
to offer, Star will shortly provide a fifth channel - Zee TV, a Hindi
entertainment channel which will run the latest hits from India's film
industry.
Apart from Star, Indian cable operators offer the American CNN, which is far
less popular, and PTV, a Pakistan television network, which has worried the
government about the effect of political propaganda from across the border.
Also, though the government is still complacent that it will be a long time
before Star and other television networks give Indians, especially in the
villages, access to uncensored news and unabashed entertainment, television
experts reckon that at least a third of India will have access to satellite
television by the end of the century, making it part of the global village
virtually overnight. Though much of Star's fare is mediocre, at least people
have a choice without state censorship.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Huge selling of pound and lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN currencies and the US dollar suffered sharp falls against the
D-Mark yesterday as investors panicked over Germany's decision not to cut
its short-term interest rates last Friday, writes James Blitz.
Another concerted round of D-Mark buying was triggered by a growing belief
that the differential between US and German short term interest rates could
rise. The Bundesbank left the Lombard rate unchanged while dealers believe
that the Federal Reserve might cut rates at its Federal open Markets
Committee today following Friday's poor non-farm payroll figure.
The falls in both the lira and sterling, which are now floating outside the
ERM, were the most dramatic of the day. Yesterday's run on both currencies
was triggered by new and acute uncertainties over their governments'
economic policies.
In Italy's case, the market was plagued by fears that the government's new
budget will not be passed, that capital controls will be introduced and that
a general strike is imminent. The lira again fell victim to selling by
Italian corporates, dropping a dramatic 5 per cent on the day and closing at
L934.4 from a previous L885.6. According to Mr David Cocker, chief economist
of Chemical Bank, the market is targeting a fall to L1000 per D-Mark.
Sterling's loss of 12.5 pfennigs against the D-Mark in three trading days
results from an economic policy vacuum in the UK government. A worrying
feature of the pound's decline is that it reflects heavy institutional
selling of gilts and UK denominated bonds.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew, says that
European fund managers started to sell sterling between DM2.50 and DM2.40.
'European funds were big purchasers of gilts earlier this year in the belief
that there was little currency risk and a yield to be gained,' he said. Mr
Persaud projects a fall to DM2.30 by the year's end. The pound closed at
DM2.3920 from a previous close of DM2.43.
The conviction that a realignment is imminent put pressure on several ERM
currencies.
Potentially the most important fall was the French franc's, which closed at
FFr3.3930 to the D-Mark from a previous FFr3.3860. Both the Bundesbank and
the Bank of France have spent hugely to support a currency whose devaluation
would signal the end of the ERM. Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London, believes that the pressure on
the franc will continue if there is no realignment.
The peseta closed at Pta71.40, a little closer to its floor of Pta72.62,
even though the Bank of Spain intervened to support the currency.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Money Markets: Volatility in rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING cash rates rose sharply yesterday morning after the pound slumped
to a new historic low of DM2.3690 against the D-Mark, suggesting that
another cut in UK base rates was unlikely to materialise.
However, rates softened closer to the day's opening level in the afternoon
as the pound rebounded by about 3 pfennigs to around DM2.39. The fall in
world stockmarkets also suggested that the case for a rate cut may become
stronger in Europe.
In the morning, 3 month sterling cash rose to 9 3/8 per cent on the offered
side from a previous close of 9 1/8 per cent, while 1 month money was up at
9 1/2 per cent.
Sterling futures also dipped sharply as dealers began to wonder whether the
Conservatives might be forced into a rate rise to support the pound in the
week of their party conference. The December short sterling contract fell 47
basis points to a low of 91.25 in the morning.
However, in the afternoon, the case for a rate cut resurfaced. Three-month
money closed at 9 3/16 per cent, while the 1-month closed at 9 7/16 per
cent. One clearing bank dealer said that there was no market pressure for a
base rate rise with period rates at these levels. The December contract
closed at 91.69, 3 basis points down on the day.
A discount house dealer said that the day's events had convinced him that
there was an overwhelming case for a cut in UK base rates.
He said that a rate rise could neither support sterling, the lira, nor most
European currencies.
The case for a rate cut was also underlined by the fall in the FT-SE index
of 100 leading shares, which registered the largest one-day fall since Black
Tuesday in 1987. 'Britain's politicians are living in Disneyworld,' he said.
'They should have cut rates by 2 per cent two weeks ago.'
The Bank of England's operations were straightforward. In early operations,
the Bank purchased Pounds 347m of Band 1 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent,
Pounds 97m of Band 2 bank bills at 8 7/8 per cent and Pounds 910m in a
repurchase agreement at 8 15/16 per cent.
The forecast was revised to Pounds 1.55bn and the Bank purchased Pounds 206m
of Band 1 bank bills.

FT  06 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow stages big recovery after
early slump
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
STAGING A remarkable turnaround, the Dow Jones Industrial Averge ended only
modestly lower yesterday after bargain buying and interest rate cut hopes
had helped stock markets recover from an early 100-point loss, writes
Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 21.61 at 3,179.00,
compared to its low of the day of around 3,097.40 The other main indices all
moved in similar fashion. The more broadly based Standard&amp; Poor's 500 ended
down 2.89 at 407.58, the Amex composite down 4.62 at 366.62 and the Nasdaq
composite 6.42 lower at 565.21. Turnover was the heaviest of the year at
287m shares.
Losses on European markets where the lack of a cut in German interest rates
sent share prices sprawling, and last Friday's 53-point drop in the Dow set
the tone for a bad start. The Dow fell 26 points in the first half hour, and
with program selling filling a market vacuum that had been created by the
absence of buyers, the index fell even further in the next 90 minutes to a
new intraday 1992 low of 3,097.40.
Traders said there were many reasons for the losses including: deepening
concern about the economic outlook; disappointment that the Federal Reserve
did not cut interest rates on Friday after a bad September employment
report; and the growing belief that Governor Bill Clinton will win the
presidency in November. and that a Democratic victory has yet to be fully
priced into the market. and fear that stock prices may prove overvalued if
third and fourth quarter corporate earnings fail to match up to
expectations.
Prices recovered strongly , however, later in the day as program selling
petered out, some investors went bargain buying and investors focused on
speculation that the Fed would cut interest rates after today's meeting of
the policy-making open market committee.
Leading stocks moved down and then back up with the market. Philip Morris
closed down Dollars  5/8 at Dollars 82 3/4 , Merck down Dollars 1/8 at
Dollars 42 7/8 ,and General Electric down Dollars  3/8 at Dollars 75 3/8 -
all three at least Dollars 1 above their session lows.
Marriott bucked the trend all day, rising Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 19 1/4
after the hotels group announced plans to split its operations.
Canada
TORONTO prices closed only slightly lower, after staging a remarkable
recovery from a sharp decline early in the session.
The TSE 300 composite index closed down 3.54 points, or 0.11%, to 3,227.53
with declining issues topping advances 431 to 148. Volume was heavy, as
36.9m shares valued at CDollars 472.1m changed hands compared with Friday's
33.3m valued at CDollars 380.5m.

FT  06 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: ERM turmoil keeps pressure on bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continued turmoil in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism and disappointment
that the Bundesbank did not lower its interest rates kept the pressure on
European bourses last week.
The FT-Actuaries World index lost 2.6 per cent in local currency terms,
burdened by falls in Europe and by the 5.4 per cent drop in Japan.
The worst performer was France, which fell by 7.3 per cent on fears that
foreign exchange speculators had not given up their fight with the French
authorities. The consequent rise in short-term money market rates to protect
the French currency, to around 13 5/8 per cent from 10 1/8 per cent before
Black Wednesday, has severely depressed the bourse.
Mr David Harrington at James Capel in Paris has detected net selling by UK
and US institutional investors, perhaps as asset allocators increase their
weightings in favour of bonds. A spate of poor interim results and a growing
consensus that 1993 earnings estimates could be too high have also prompted
investors to sell.
'In the short-term, there is not a lot of scope for the French market,' says
Mr Harrington, though he does not rule out a trading bounce. However, the
longer-term prospects for French equities are better than elsewhere on the
Continent.
Spain came a close second in the worst performance stakes, losing 7 per cent
after an announcement by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, that it might
lower its credit rating on Spanish foreign debt paper reduced an already
enfeebled stock market to a wreck.
In a week when there were few gainers, Mexico stood out with a rise of 6.5
per cent, fuelled by end of quarter cross-trades and the Treasury bill
auction which resulted in unchanged longer-term rates, except the 28-day
rate which rose by 25 basis points to 19.25 per cent. Some operators had
been fearing a higher increase in rates.

FT  06 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets: Nikkei extends fall to seventh
consecutive session
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING concerns over a delayed economic recovery in the US depressed
share prices, and the Nikkei average extended its decline for the seventh
session, its longest consecutive fall this year, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed down 225.57 to 17,101.50 on arbitrage
unwinding. The index opened at the day's high of 17,265.20 before falling to
the day's low of 16,962.29 later in the morning.
Volume fell to 180m shares from 245m, below 200m for the first time since
August 18. Losers led gainers by 653 to 274, with 158 issues remaining
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 10.43 to
1,292.71 and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index 7.08 to 1,020.74.
Small-lot buying by public funds was noted in the afternoon but investors
remained inactive following last week's fall on Wall Street. The higher yen
and worries over profits at leading Japanese exporters also depressed
sentiment.
Investors said that the effects of the economic support package were wearing
off. 'The market went up way too fast and there was bound to a correction,'
said Mr Alan Livsey at Kleinwort Benson. The market has lost 8.1 per cent
since the index started to fall on September 25.
Construction companies lost ground, dragged down by Shimizu, which fell Y40
to Y910. Investors rushed to place sell orders on last week's announcement,
that the company expected to post losses on the liquidation of its UK and
Australian subsidiaries.
Leading exporters were depressed on the yen's strength. Matsushita Electric
Industrial lost Y20 to Y1,070, and Nikon, the precision manufacturer, Y21 to
Y600. However, Hitachi added Y13 to Y740 on bargain hunting by public funds.
Alps Electric lost Y39 to Y870 on its announcement that it expected to post
an 89 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the fiscal year to next March. It
also announced a Y5 cut in dividends per share for the business year.
Aisin Seiki, a auto parts maker affiliated to Toyota Motor, rose Y42 to
Y1,040, becoming the day's most actively traded issue. The company has
become popular among short-term speculators on the reported success of its
room-temperature nuclear fusion experiment.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 214.31 to 18,717.38 in volume of 4.1m shares.
Foreign investors were seen liquidating Nintendo, the video game maker,
which fell Y70 to Y9,700. Roundup
TOKYO's decline was reflected in the region's weakness yesterday. Hong Kong
was closed for a public holiday.
AUSTRALIA retreated further but volume remained low because of a public
holiday in New South Wales.
The All Ordinaries finished at its lowest level for 18 months, down 15.80 at
1,467.1 with 52m shares traded worth ADollars 111m.
The banking sector remained under pressure with BHP shedding 24 cents to
ADollars 11.70 and ANZ striking its lowest level for nearly seven years,
down 11 cents at ADollars 2.77.
SEOUL fell on fears of political unrest, on reports that the steel tycoon,
Park Tae-joon, had offered to quit as head of Pohang Iron and Steel and
might decline to act as campaign manager for the ruling party's presidential
candidate.
The composite stock index closed 10.90, or 2.1 per cent lower at 502.22 in
turnover of Won94.58bn, having been closed on Saturday for National
Foundation Day.
TAIWAN tried to accelerate last week's uptrend, with the weighted index up
70 points after the central bank's 0.5 percentage point cut in the
rediscount rate last Saturday; but it lost momentum, and the index ended
16.20 better at 3,720.45 in turnover up from TDollars 22.08bn to TDollars
24.8bn.
BANGKOK saw profit-taking in property groups and banks which had both risen
strongly last week. The SET index fell 3.11 to 877.60 in turnover of
Bt14.6bn. Advances led declines 127 to 114 with 47 unchanged. Bangkok Land
and Krisda Mahanakorn lost Bt2 and Bt10 respectively to Bt143 and Bt175.
MANILA rose around midsession as aggressive buyers came in to accumulate
stocks ahead of a long-awaited fourth-quarter climb. The composite index
rose 13.87 to 1,442.65.
NEW ZEALAND was dominated by trading in Fletcher Challenge and Carter Holt
Harvey and the NZSE-40 index lost 11.43 to 1,412.00. Turnover was moderate
at NZDollars 12.6m.
FLC fell 3 cents to NZDollars 1.91 and Carter Holt Harvey lost 1 cent to
NZDollars 2.49.

FT  06 OCT 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent drops as economic
outlook worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OCTOBER's record as a month for stock market crashes, combined with falls in
currencies and on Wall Street and weekend comment on domestic economic
prospects, put European bourses in a seriously fragile mood yesterday,
writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT dropped on weekend gloom about job cuts, the DAX index falling
53.64 to a new 20-month low of 1,424.40; it could have broken down through
1,400, said a dealer, if Frankfurt trading hours had matched those of
London.
UK holders of German stocks realised that they still had profits to take in
sterling terms. The drop in share prices reflected institutional selling in
an illiquid market, although turnover rose on the day.
Downgrades continued, and widened as Nikko Europe brought 1992 earnings
growth projections for the market down from a plus of 8 per cent at the
beginning of the year to minus 5 per cent yesterday.
Export stocks came under pressure again. In carmakers, Warburgs downgraded
Volkswagen which dropped 6 per cent to DM263.20, and extended its drop to
9.3 per cent at the London post-bourse close. James Capel was a heavy seller
of BMW, and of Mannesmann where it had downgraded its EPS projection from
DM11 to DM8 for next year. The shares dropped 5.8 per cent to DM201.50.
Chemicals also came under heavy selling pressure. Hoechst fared worst, off
DM11.20 at DM218.10 on a recent negative report on bulk plastics of which
the company is the biggest exporter.
PARIS tumbled as foreign and domestic investors sold heavily and there was a
suspicion that the brief recovery towards the close was due to support
buying by the government-owned Caisse des Depots. The CAC-40 index dropped
below the important 1,600 level to 1,577.74 before closing 72.30 lower at
1,611.04 in heavy turnover of FFr3.4bn.
Dealers said that they expected a technical bounce today but that
institutions would use this as an opportunity to offload more stock. They
added that the market's trend remained downwards, with the new trading range
at between 1,500 and 1,600.
Selling was across the board, though one of the most prominent losers was
Eurotunnel which dropped FFr4.95 or 14 per cent to FFr30.35. Investors were
disappointed by official comments made an analysts' meeting yesterday.
MILAN was depressed by a flood of orders to sell Stet from foreign and
domestic investors, disgusted by Friday's news that the telecommunications
company was going to pay L700bn for an 83.3 per cent stake in the state
software company, Finsiel.
The 23.4 per cent drop in Stet shares, continued weakness of the lira
against the mark and falls on foreign bourses worried the market. But the
Comit index contained its loss to 6.9 points at 358.37, since trading in
other shares was quiet. The big volume in Stet - estimated to be at least
13m ordinary shares - boosted the day's turnover to around L140bn from
Friday's L125bn.
Stet ordinary shares fell L315 to L1,035 at the official fixing, though
trading in the stock had initially been suspended because of an order
imbalance.
James Capel, echoing the view held by other market participants, said the
the government's decision to sell Finsiel to Stet was blatantly political,
ignored the wishes and rights of minority shareholders and stuffed Stet with
a wholly incompatible business. The broker now regarded Stet as an outright
sell since the transaction would result in heavy dilution and higher
interest costs, and consequently cut its 1993 forecast for group net income
by L80bn to L1,490bn.
AMSTERDAM fell steadily in line with neighbouring markets as the CBS
Tendency index closed down 4.00 at 106.1. Akzo was one of the day's biggest
losers, down Fl 7.60 or 5.4 per cent at Fl 132.80 while Elsevier, Fl 4.80
lower at Fl 104.60, was also affected by sterling's weakness. Nedlloyd,
which rose at the opening on news of stakebuilding by DNO, the Norwegian oil
group, fell Fl 1.30 to Fl 32.70.
ZURICH selling centred on industrial blue chips as the SMI index fell 80.3
to 1,787.38. The dollar-sensitive pharmaceuticals featured with Ciba-Geigy
down SFr21 to SFr608, Sandoz SFr70 francs to SFr2,720 and Roche SFr160 to
SFr3,380. However, the defensive qualities of the banking sector were not so
evident as in some other bourses, as UBS fell SFr24 to SFr75, SBC by SFr7 to
SFr269 and CS Holding by SFr90 to SFr1,875.
STOCKHOLM's concern over high interest rates and currency turbulence sent
the Affarsvarlden General index down 42.2 to a new 1992 low of 1639.0 in
moderate turnover of SKr443m after SKr350m.
Stora B fell SKr11 to SKr175 after the forestry and paper group revealed an
eight-month loss after a corresponding profit last year.
MADRID was unimpressed by the partial relaxation of capital controls and the
general index fell 6.8 to 179.48 with the losses spread throughout the large
blue chip stocks. Turnover was Pta13.4bn.
Banesto went against the trend with a Pta35 rise to Pta1,955. Elsewhere
Repsol weakened Pta135 to Pta2,090 while Telefonica extended last week's
losses, down Pta53 to Pta876.
VIENNA's fall was largely the result of interbank transactions, dealers
said. The ATX index shed 29.87 or 3.7 per cent to 769.45.

FT  06 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market welcomes RHM bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, PETER JOHN, STEVE THOMPSON and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in RHM (Ranks Hovis McDougall) soared following the hostile Pounds
780m bid from Hanson closing 66 ahead at 241p - 21 above the bid price - in
very heavy turnover of 14m, making it the heaviest traded stock in the
market. RHM has long been rumoured a bid target as the shares have
underperformed amid increasingly difficult trading conditions which has seen
overcapacity rife in the milling and bakery market. Hanson, which has made
little secret of its acquisitive intentions in a variety of industries, has
been one of several companies said to be eyeing RHM recently. Hanson shares
declined 5 1/2 to 202p.
However, many in the market believe Hanson will not face a counter bid. Mr
Carl Short at Nomura said: 'This is exactly what anyone waiting to buy a
discreet part of RHM will have wanted.' Market sources indicated that if
broken up the RHM group could be worth around Pounds 1.1bn, with the grocery
products division worth about Pounds 430m and the food services business
some Pounds 200m.
Brokers reported institutional investors as largely supportive of the Hanson
bid, although the price may have to be increased. RHM's profits have been in
decline for the past five years and the board is seen as largely friendless
in the City. Mr Julian Lakin at Smith New Court suggested that in the
absence of a counter bid an increased offer of around 240p would likely to
be acceptable to most large investors. Associated British Foods rose 9 to
409p on hopes of a restructuring of the UK bakery market.
Eurotunnel weak
The announcement from Eurotunnel of a seven-month delay in the planned
opening of the Channel tunnel, upset an already gloomy market and sent
shares tumbling, as worries of a rights issue resurfaced.
The company, which reported its figures yesterday, also cut its revenue
forecasts for the first year of operation. The shares responded by dropping
62 to 358p, a fall compounded by the general weakness in the market, with
turnover reaching 1.6m, a hefty figure for Eurotunnel.
Analysts brushed aside assurances from the company's chief executive and
suggested that the delay in openning now set for December 1993 could force
the company to seek further funding.
Mr Clive Anderson at Smith New Court said of yesterday's fall: 'The market
reaction is one of disappointment that we are now into a different phase of
uncertainity, brought about by the delay in the opening. The implication is
for some form of cash call.'
Owners Abroad busy
Speculative takeover talk surrounded Owners Abroad for most of the day,
pushing the shares higher in brisk turnover of 1.7m. The company was
reported to have denied the market hints to analysts, suggesting that its
shares often attracted such spurious talk when staging a recovery. Owners
shares have drifted from a year high of 121p in March to a low of 46p three
weeks ago. However, news of a healthy late summer season has lifted shares
in the holiday groups. Yesterday Owners climbed 1 1/2 to 71p, while
Airtours, a rumoured predator for Owners, slipped 13 to 240p.
Insurance shares tumbled across the board, affected primarily by the general
plunge in international markets, but additionally weakened by the air
disaster in Amsterdam and the latest floods in the US. Fears that the
downward pressure on sterling could force a rise in interest rates, also
upset the sector.
Commercial Union was the worst affected of the composite insurers,
retreating 39 to 497p on higher than usual turnover of 2.3m, amid hints of a
broker sell note. General Accident lost 25 to 485p on 1.6m traded, while
Royals fell 10 to 173p and Guardian Royal 8 to 143p.
Lasmo Legal &amp; General dropped 25 to 325p and Prudential 16 to 250p, the
latter after relatively heavy trading of 4.7m shares.
The big banks were among the market's most heavily traded stocks.
The start of a series of presentations to US institutions, ahead of the
forthcoming ADR listing, failed to prevent Enterprise Oil stock from
retreating in line with the market. They ended a busy session 17 weaker at
408p. Lasmo performed well in early trading, with the shares only marginally
off at 161p, sustained by reports that the group will seek a US listing next
year, before turning off to close7 1/2 down at 154p. Turnover in Lasmo was a
good 2.9m shares.
Although closing a net 7 down at 333p, Vodafone shares were among only a
handful of stocks to have traded in positive territory during the session,
having touched 342p in mid-morning. The early rise followed appraisals of
new subscriber numbers for September and the initial response to the launch
of Lowcall, Vodafone's new service which offers lower monthly access prices
in exchange for higher call charges.
Newly-demerged Racal Electronics settled at 129p and Chubb Security at 184p,
down 17p.
Among internationally traded stocks, Reuters fell 39 to 1198p, Glaxo lost 36
at 737p and BAT Industries also dropped 36 to 791p. ICI, which tends to be
affected by the D-Mark rather than the dollar, performed slightly better,
shedding 29 to 1070p.
SmithKline Beecham was firmer towards the close of trading on expectation
that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) would act favourably over a
SmithKline anti-depressant drug. There are estimates that the product could
generate revenue of around Pounds 300m within three years compared to only
Pounds 3m last year. The 'A' shares were down 26 at worst but rallied to end
the day 22 off at 469p.
Reed International shed 19 to 536p.
The UK's largest market research organisation, Taylor Nelson (formerly
Addison Consultancy), was one of the most heavily traded stocks in the
market. The group's broker Peel Hunt completed the sale, initiated on
Friday, of a near-five per cent stake in Taylor. Hunt crossed a large block
of shares at 14p a share on behalf of one investment fund prompting turnover
of 9.3m. The shares closed only a halfpenny easier at 14 1/2 p.

FT  06 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK index futures sector suffered one of its biggest one day falls
this year leaving the December contract on the Footsie to trade at a
discount to fair value for most of the session as the slide in sterling once
again undermined market sentiment, writes Joel Kibazo.
The opening level of the December contract was recorded at 2,550, which
proved to be the high point of the session as early sellers and the poor
performance of sterling led to a sharp fall to 2,518 within minutes of the
opening.
Attempts at a rally mid-morning met with resistance and December once again
declined, falling to 2,483 by lunchtime, with sentiment hurt by the weakness
in the gilts market.
The afternoon saw a rally as Wall Street initially showed only a modest
fall. That changed when Wall Street started declining sharply and was
followed by a bout of what one trader called 'panic selling'. December
finished at 2,460, some 20 points below its estimated fair value premium to
cash of about 32. Turnover reached 14,768.
The options volume reached 40,670 contracts. The FT-SE option traded 20,761
lots while BT was the busiest stock option at 1,784 contracts.

FT  06 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Economic gloom brings savage losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market yesterday suffered its largest one-day fall since
the October Crash of 1987 as concern over the plunging UK currency was
engulfed in wider worries over the European and US economies. A final blow
came when Wall Street collapsed in early dealings, driving the FT-SE Index
back to its day's low of 2,446.3 for a net loss of 103.4, or four per cent,
on the session.
There was a moment of near-disaster at mid-afternoon when the early fall of
more than 100 points on the Dow Industrial Average prompted such a rush to
mark shares down in London that the Seaq system, unable to handle the
pressure, went 'indicative only' for a few minutes; marketmakers are not
bound to deal at indicative screen prices.
But the institutions were not heavy sellers of shares in London yesterday.
Much of the loss reflected frantic marking down operations by the
marketmaking firms, which were also actively arbitraging between equities
and the futures market.
The day's Seaq volume fell to 477.6m shares from 599.9m on Friday, when
retail business was worth Pounds 1.1bn. London equities fell by
significantly less than some other leading European stock markets and
several strategists suggested that the UK might benefit from European-wide
moves to restore economic confidence.
Traders also took some encouragement from a cash bid of Pounds 780m by
Hanson Group for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the food company. Following on the
heels of last week's raid on Trafalgar House, this move indicated a revival
in corporate activity.
UK share prices fell away quickly yesterday morning as the stock market
reacted to the renewed setback in sterling at the beginning of a trading
week which will be highlighted by the annual conference of Britain's
governing Conservative party. Hopes of a further cut in UK base rates
evaporated on Friday and the City now fears that political unwillingness to
raise rates during the Tory conference may leave sterling at the mercy of
currency speculators again.
When the December futures contract on the Footsie opened at a discount to
the cash market yesterday morning, pressure on the blue chip stocks was
intensified by basket trading, where falls in the stock index future are
matched by sales of the underlying stocks. Shares extended their losses as
sterling fell by nearly six pfennigs against the D-mark and by mid-session
the Footsie was 80 points off.
The London stock market has now lost about two-thirds of the hurried rise
which followed sterling's departure from the ERM network. Mr Robin Aspinall
at Panmure Gordon warns that, if the rally in the Footsie is truly over,
then the index could fall to 2,200, if not 1,620 before looking for the next
bull phase.
The continuing slide in sterling, coupled with uncertainty over interest
rates, has undermined comparative valuations of UK equities and government
bonds at the opening of the final quarter of the year. Nervousness in the
stock market was enhanced by further rises in yields on long-dated gilts
yesterday.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cotton output dips but surplus
likely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD cotton production is expected to dip during 1992-93, but world
storehouses are bulging with the largest surplus in years and global
production is likely to exceed consumption for the third consecutive year.
The outlook, according to the International Cotton Advisory Committee in
Washington, is for continued high stocks, a 3.6 per cent rise in global
consumption, but lower prices in 1993. Almost three-quarters of the world's
cotton is now produced in five countries: China, the US, India, Pakistan and
Uzbekistan.
This year, US producers planted 600,000 hectares less than last year in
response to government set-asides and because heavy rains in Texas prevented
or destroyed plantings. However, in 1993, the committee expects a production
rebound in the US from 3.48m tonnes to 3.74m tonnes.
Output is expected to fall slightly in China and India while rising slightly
in Pakistan and the Commonwealth of Independent States. Although the US
agriculture department maintains an optimistic forecast for American cotton
ex-ports, producers and analysts are concerned about new competitors
encroaching on markets where US exporters have made gains in recent years -
particularly in East Asia.
In Europe, the US is losing ground to exports from central Asian republics,
now freed of the necessity to send their goods to Russia and Ukraine and
hungry for the hard currency which the west can provide. The largest decline
in consumption in western Europe was in Germany.
French mill use fell an estimated 13,000 tonnes to 100,000 in 1991-92, the
fifth consecutive year of decline. Some analysts say that current fashion
trends favour the use of chemical fibres, but increased competition from
coarse count cotton yarn imports may be encouraging a shift in the structure
of French mill use. US demand for cotton and cotton products is expected to
continue to grow next year, making it the seventh season out of eight for
expanded use.
'The US cotton textile industry demonstrated great strength during a season
in which the US economy was in recession,' the committee said in its most
recent report.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian mint launches a one
kilogram platinum coin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA IS attempting to breath some life back into the platinum
investment market by launching three big legal tender coins, containing two
troy ounces, 10 ounces and one kilogram of the precious metal.
This follows the success it achieved with gold coins of the same sizes last
year which helped Australia topple Canada's Maple Leaf gold bullion coin
from market leadership, boosting market share from 15 per cent in 1990 to 35
per cent last year (see table).
Mr Don Mackay-Coghill, managing director of GoldCorp Australia, operator of
the Perth Mint which issues the coins by arrangement with the Australian
government, said at the launch in London yesterday that he expected to lift
Australia's platinum coin sales from about 65,000 ounces last year to
100,000 ounces.
GoldCorp already has market leadership in platinum coins after launching
smaller coins in November 1988. He claimed GoldCorp had a 60 per cent share
of the market, the Royal Canadian Mint 30 per cent with the Isle of Man's
Noble coin accounting for the rest.
Mr Mackay-Coghill said the new large coins - each of 99.95 per cent pure
platinum - should help to lift platinum coin sales in Japan.
He said the new products would be the first platinum coins competitive in
price with bullion bars while offering the security of what amounted to a
government guarantee. They would be sold into the distribution network at
premiums over the metal price of only 2.5 per cent for the two ounce coins,
2 per cent for the 10 ounce, and 1 per cent for the kilo coin.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Metals prices drop again after
poor economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDESPREAD gloom about worldwide economic activity took its toll at the
London Metal Exchange yesterday. Prices, which all finished last week lower
than they started, again fell across the board.
The situation was aggravated by the Chinese, who previously this year
emerged as big buyers and helped to support prices. Yesterday they changed
tactics, selling copper and aluminium, the LME's most heavily-traded metals.
Mr Nick Moore, analyst at Ord Minnett, part of the Westpac banking group,
said metals had been 'whiplashed by a torrent of poor economic data' from
the US, Japan and by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and
Development which said gross domestic product growth in member countries
would not exceed 1.5 per cent this year when it predicted 2.2 per cent
growth at the beginning of 1992.
'The past week is one in which the metal markets realised that metal demand
growth was not going to ride to the rescue,' he added.
'The onus is back squarely on metal producers. The choice is simple - cut
back refined metal output or spend another year in purgatory.'
According to Ms Lesley Campbell, trader at Rudolf Wolff, part of the Noranda
natural resources group, there have been occasions in the past year when big
players in the LME's copper, aluminium and zinc markets provided price
support - 'more than the fundamentals have justified.' She added: 'Too many
blind eyes have been turned away from the fundamentals for too long.'
Zinc, which has been buoyed by an options-related technical squeeze for much
of this year, showed the biggest fall yesterday. Zinc for delivery in three
months was down nearly 3.5 per cent from Friday's close or by Dollars 44 a
tonne to Dollars 1,243.50.
At one point on the LME yesterday nickel for delivery in three months fell
to Dollars 6,630, its lowest level since February 1990, nearly Dollars 1,100
below the best price this summer and only marginally above Dollars 3 a lb -
a level which holds tremendous psychological importance for the producers
and for market sentiment. The price recovered slightly later to close at
Dollars 6,640 a tonne, down Dollars 110 or 1.6 per cent on Friday's close.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Comibol tries to regain access
to mines
</HEADLINE>

   LA PAZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMIBOL, Bolivia's state mining corporation, has sacked 19 miners and
started legal action against three union officials in an attempt to regain
access to mines closed by industrial action.
The long-running conflict between the government and miners over the
introduction of joint venture and leasing contracts is now threatening to
develop into open warfare. Victor Baldivieso, a union leader, said the
sackings would lead to 'confrontations, sacrifice, and the putting at risk
of lives to defend the country's mines'. Mr Baldivieso has warned that his
members may occupy the mines of state mining corporation Comibol in protest
at the government's actions.
The 19 miners sacked by Comibol are blocking the three entrances to the
Rasna mine, which was recently subject to a joint venture deal with
Cominesa, a subsidiary of Hexagon Resources of the US. The mining ministry
is now planning similar action in two further mining works - Colquiri and
Catavi - recently handed over to private firms but currently closed by
industrial action.
The attempts of both Comibol and the mining ministry to force through joint
venture and leasing deals in spite of union opposition is a sign of growing
desperation.
In addition, it is unlikely that the World Bank, at present withholding a
Dollars 35m mining credit in protest at the slow pace of change at Comibol,
will release the funds until the three occupied mining operations are back
in production.

London GOLD pushed higher out of its range of the past two weeks on fresh US
fund buying on Comex against a background of volatile currencies and falling
share markets. Dealers said expected resistance at Dollars 350 a troy ounce
was brushed aside and the market is now focusing on Dollars 352 as the
upside barrier. But Europe was largely side-lined with activity focused on
Comex after the dollar slipped to a record low against the yen. London COCOA
closed near its highs above key resistance levels, making way for possible
further gains. Dealers said much cocoa activity centred on currency
movements, with weak sterling pushing prices through key resistance and
triggering buy-stops which took the market to the highs. There was some talk
of light selling from Ghana. The December close of Pounds 684 a tonne could
mean a test of Pounds 700 today, dealers said. New York raw SUGAR futures
were lower but holding support at midday on selling tied to chart factors
and renewed sentiment that the market was oversupplied after news that
German statistician FO Licht now pegs world production in the 1992-93 season
at 116.42m tonnes, compared with 115.85m this season.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Government Bonds: Bunds offer safe haven from European
weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond prices were driven primarily by movements in the foreign
exchange and stock markets yesterday. Bunds benefited from the strength of
the D-Mark, while most of the other European bond markets suffered due to
further currency weakness. However, sliding stock market prices throughout
Europe encouraged some switching into bonds later in the day.
GILT prices fell sharply due to pressure on the pound and the lack of any
coherent economic policy following sterling's withdrawal from the exchange
rate mechanism.
Renewed currency weakness intensified fears that further interest rate cuts
will not be forthcoming, dealers said.
Long-dated gilts received a further battering, ending a point lower as
inflationary fears caused a further steepening of the yield curve. 'An
inflation risk premium is being built into the long end of the market,' said
Mr Neil MacKinnon, economist at Citibank.
Short and medium-dated gilts recovered some lost ground, as the slide in UK
stock prices prompted switching into bonds.
Following the recent slide in the long-end of the market, 25-year gilts are
currently yielding more than 9 1/2 per cent. 'The closer long-dated yields
are to 10 per cent, the more attractive they will become,' said Mr Simon
Briscoe, economist at Midland Montagu. 'The likelihood is that we will cut
interest rates before the rest of the (European) bloc.'
The policy vacuum following sterling's withdrawal from the ERM continues to
sap confidence in the government's ability to tackle the crisis, dealers
said. Traders will be watching the Conservative party conference, which
starts today, for signs of a fresh economic policy. However, most analysts
expect that detailed plans will not be revealed until the autumn statement,
although some hints could emerge after Monday's Treasury committee meeting.
The long gilt future on Liffe ended at 95.03, down from Friday's close of
95.28.
US Treasury prices eased at the long end yesterday after concern about the
deficit and the lack of an interest rate cut erased early gains achieved on
the back of a weak equity market.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/4 at 98 -
half a point below its high for the day - yielding 7.348 per cent. The
two-year note was unchanged at 100 19/32 , yielding 3.670 per cent.
An early 100-point loss on the Dow Jones Industrial Average prompted some
investors to switch out of stocks and into government securities in the
first few hours of trading. This was most noticeable at the short end of the
market, which provided a boost to everything from two-year to 10-year notes.
Although bonds joined in the early gains, they fell back later as equity
prices retraced their steps, and on concern that whichever political party
wins in November will ultimately do little to reduce the deficit.
THE GERMAN bund market benefited from its safe haven status as the D-Mark
gained ground against other European currencies. Because of the strength of
the currency, the German authorities will be able to ease interest rates at
will, while most European governments are constrained by currency
considerations. Growing evidence that the German economy is slowing is
boosting hopes that an easing of German monetary policy is on the horizon.
Traders said the bund market benefited from a repatriation of funds by
German investors from other bond markets, as well as switching from the
German stock market, which fell 4 per cent yesterday, into bunds. The bund
future on Liffe ended at 91.78, up from Friday's close of 91.45.
ITALIAN bonds continued their downward spiral yesterday as the lira slid in
the foreign exchange market. Dealers said last week's three, five and
seven-year government bond auctions and yesterday's 10-year auction helped
push prices down. As cash market liquidity dries up, trading is becoming
concentrated on the futures market. The Italian BTP contract on Liffe ended
at 88.70 yesterday, down from Friday's close of 90.89, in volume of 16,000
contracts.
PRESSURE on the franc caused French bonds to fall sharply, but prices
benefited from a drop of more than 4 per cent in the French stock market.
Although the franc lost a couple of pfennigs, it remained comfortably above
its ERM floor. The French OAT future on the Matif exchange in Paris hit a
low of 108.72, before recovering to close at 109.14, only 10 basis points
below Friday's close.
JAPANESE government bond prices ended flat, although the tone remains
bullish as the strength of the yen continues to encourage international
investors taking funds out of weak European bond markets.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Difficult launch for Republic of
Finland issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Republic of Finland yesterday led the expected wave of European
sovereign borrowers to come to the international bond market, only to come
unstuck in the treacherous market conditions that have beset other large
issues in the past month.
A comment from the country's finance minister, apparently warning of the
danger of bankruptcy if Finland did not take firmer control of its budget,
turned what was already a difficult issue to launch into a near-impossible
one.
At the opening of a training college for senior civil servants, Mr Iiro
Viinanen said: 'Harsh cuts in spending will always hurt, but if the cuts are
delayed the Finnish national economy will soon be bankrupt.'
Despite attempts by the Finnish finance ministry and its advisers to play
down this comment, its timing effectively killed off much of the investor
interest in yesterday's Y75bn (Dollars 625m) issue.
Plans to break syndicate yesterday afternoon have been delayed until this
morning to seek further interest in the Far East.
Mr Viinanen's comment struck a chord among investors concerned about the
credit quality of European sovereigns, particularly in the wake of last
week's decision by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, to put both Spain
and Sweden under review for a possible downgrade.
Finland's budget deficit this year is running at around 8 per cent of gross
national product, said Mr Vekko Kantola, director of finance.
However, he added that total government debt, at 30 per cent of gross
national product was low compared with some other European states.
Finland currently has a split credit rating, with Moody's rating it AA2
compared with the higher AA+ accorded it by Standard &amp; Poor's.
Mr Kantola said recent discussions with the agencies suggested that no
immediate review was likely, though S&amp;P had changed its assessment of the
country's outlook to negative.
At a yield of 95 basis points over the Japanese yield curve, the five-year
issue was widely considered before the finance ministers' comment to have
been fairly priced to take into account the recent widening of spreads in
the Eurobond market.
However, even at that level (estimated by one banker to equate to around 50
basis points over Libor if the proceeds had been swapped) the bonds were
said to be selling slowly in a very uncertain market.
Mr Kantola said the deal had not been swapped, but that the money would
swell the non-European currency element of the country's foreign exchange
reserves, which currently stand at 17 per cent.
Yesterday's issue will keep this at under 20 per cent, in line with the
finance ministry's target, he said.
Finland's foreign currency reserves currently stand at around FM27bn
(Dollars 5.96bn), only marginally less than the FM30bn at which they are
generally held, said Mr Kantola.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Qualified stamp of approval
for Swiss reforms - Bankers give a cautious welcome to tax changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do not expect any sudden revitalisation of the Swiss financial centre
following the approval given by Swiss voters in a referendum last Sunday to
the elimination of stamp duties on some securities transactions.
That is the typically cautious message from Swiss bankers who emphasise that
there is still much to be done to make Switzerland internationally
competitive again in many financial areas.
For one thing, the tax changes do not take effect until next April. For
another, the hated stamp duties, which the financial community has been
fighting for years, still apply to about 80 per cent of securities
transactions.
'This is a step in the right direction, but it is only a step,' says Mr
Peter Widmer, executive vice-president of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich.
Bankers say that they hope it will at least prevent any further exodus of
financial business to London and Luxembourg.
'It no longer looks as if a major move of people and facilities will be
needed,' Mr Widmer says.
However, bankers say the change is not enough to encourage banks to bring
back to Switzerland the considerable proportion of business that has already
moved.
Mr Thierry Lombard, managing partner of Geneva-based private bankers Lombard
Odier, says his bank would very much like to bring back about half of the
SFr7bn (Dollars 5.6bn) in client funds that it manages in Britain, together
with the 35 or so jobs involved.
'But this reform is not sufficient,' he says.
The main losses to the Swiss financial centre in recent years - attributed
in part to the stamp duties - have been in equity trading and in the
establishment of investment trusts.
Bankers estimate that between one-fifth and one-quarter of all transactions
in Swiss equities are now carried out in London.
In a typical month, around 10 per cent of the large international equities
market conducted in London comprises deals in Swiss shares.
There has also been a rapid build-up of Swiss-controlled investment trusts
in Luxembourg, with the total reaching SFr179bn at the end of last year,
compared with only SFr34bn in Switzerland.
Removal of the 0.9 per cent stamp duty on investment trust certificates
should stop the outflow of this business, bankers say, and new investment
trusts will probably begin to be established in Switzerland.
But repatriation of existing funds will not happen until Swiss law on
investment trusts is updated, probably within the next two years.
Similarly, the elimination of duties on bankers' dealings for their own
account should boost the liquidity of the Swiss equity markets and promote
market-making there.
However, market-making, especially in the shares of Swiss multinationals,
will likely remain very strong in London, not least because stamp duties
will continue on all client-related equity transactions in Switzerland.
One area of considerable promise arising from the reform is the Swiss money
market.
Until now, there has not been much of a money market because of the stamp
duty on these transactions.
In recent years, the central bank has issued notional money market
certificates. And Credit Suisse has pioneered in underwriting these book
entry issues for corporations and local authorities in lieu of commercial
paper. Now a real money market can be established.

LATIN American Securities is to launch an open-end fund that will invest
only in Latin American US dollar-denominated debt instruments.
The Latin American Income Company Sicav (Latinco), listed in Luxembourg,
will provide a gross dividend of between 8 and 9 per cent on an annualised
basis, paid every six months. Mr Marc Wenhammer, Latinco's adviser, said the
fund would have high liquidity, since its net asset value would be
calculated daily, allowing daily dealing.
The fund will be diversified, with less than 5 per cent in any single
instrument and less than 35 per cent in a single country.
About 70 per cent of the fund will be invested in instruments which mature
in less than two years in order to minimise capital risk.

<TEXT>
THE DRASTIC slimming regime necessary to make General Motors competitive
against its main US and Japanese rivals was underscored yesterday by a
survey showing its vehicle assembly productivity lagging far behind fellow
Detroit companies Ford Motor and Chrysler.
The report, compiled by Harbour and Associates, a Detroit-based vehicle
industry consultancy, showed Ford to have the greatest productivity among
the US Big Three, as measured by assembly workers per vehicle.
Ford was estimated to have 3.01 workers per vehicle, compared to 3.76 for
Chrysler and 4.55 for General Motors. In 1989, when Harbour last undertook
an industry study, the respective figures were 3.25, 4.58 and 4.88.
Mr Jim Harbour, who heads the consultancy, said yesterday that 'Ford's
productivity is equal to any transplant (Japanese assembly plant) in the US.
Chrysler is getting better very fast. It has improved enormously over the
last few years. General Motors is standing still.'
General Motors has announced plans to cut 74,000 blue and white collar jobs
by between now and 1995, but Mr Harbour estimated yesterday that some 90,000
jobs might have to go to make the company competitive with Ford.
These comprised 54,000 jobs in its vehicle assembly, body stamping, engine
and transmission manufacturing works, and possibly another 15,000 salaried
staff and 20,000 in components operations.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: USAir disrupted by ground crew
strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of ground crew workers went on strike yesterday against USAir, the
US carrier into which British Airways is seeking to invest Dollars 750m for
a large minority stake.
The strike action, which stems from USAir's efforts to secure work rule
changes and wage concessions in negotiations with the International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, had an immediate impact on
operations.
The carrier, which runs about 2,750 jet departures each day, immediately cut
jet flight schedules to 60 per cent of the normal level.
The damage done to USAir will depend heavily on how long the strike lasts.
Yesterday, the airline said that it was in talks with a federal mediator and
the IAM, in the hope that matters could be quickly resolved - although USAir
claimed to have contingency plans aimed at restoring 100 per cent of flight
capacity if the industrial action persists.
However, Standard &amp; Poors, the large ratings agency which has USAir debt
under review with 'developing' implications, warned: 'The strike by the
machinists, while not as damaging as a pilots' strike, could cause serious
disruption and losses if it lasts for more than a few days'.
Mr Jim Conley of the IAM said there were pickets 'at all locations where
USAir flies in the US'. By mid-morning, the USAir flight attendants union,
the Association of Flight Attendants, had thrown its support behind the
mechanics' strike, and instructed members not to cross picket lines.
However, the USAir's pilots union said that it was taking no position on the
dispute. It advised members to report for work as scheduled - although not
to perform other duties. USAir, meanwhile, said that the strike was not
expected to affect its shuttle operation, between New York, Boston and
Washington DC, or its USAir Express commuter carriers. It added that
international flights were running as normal.
A number of other US airlines - including Continental, Northwest, America
West and Delta - said that they would generally try to accommodate
strike-hit passengers holding USAir tickets, where space permitted.
USAir, which has lost about Dollars 760m after tax during the past two
years, has been asking all employees to accept wage and work rule
concessions in an attempt to prune about Dollars 400m from its annual cost
base.
USAir reached an agreement with its pilots, earlier this year but
negotiations with the mechanics and flight attendants have remained
unresolved.
USAir shares slumped  3/4 to Dollars 11 1/4 .
USAir said yesterday that the period in which British Airways may terminate
its investment offer has been extended to November 9 from October 4.
British Airways can rescind its offer if it is not satisfied with a due
diligence investigation of USAir.
In addition, talks between the US and the UK governments about revisions to
the bilateral aviation agreement are scheduled to resume this week.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRIDGESTONE, the Japanese tyremaker, expects to break even in Europe this
year but foresees a tough 1993 for its worldwide operations, Reuter reports
from Paris.
Mr Akira Yeiri, the chairman, told a news conference that the world's
second-largest tyre company had not changed the 1992 earnings projections
released in July. Bridgestone, which holds around 50 per cent of its
domestic market, bought US tyremaker Firestone in 1988.
That forecast saw 1992 parent net profit at Y38bn, (Dollars 31.9m), down
from a March forecast of Y40bn.
Mr Yeiri said restructuring in Europe, which led to a Dollars 100m net loss
in its European operations in 1991, would help the group break even this
year. Last month, Bridgestone said it saw a total net loss of about Dollars
150m in its US and European units this year.
A Bridgestone official said yesterday that those losses were expected to be
entirely in the US. While there were losses in the US in the first half,
operations there will break even in the second half, Mr Yeiri said.
'We see no real recovery (in world tyre markets),' Mr Yeiri said, adding
that 1993 would be 'extremely difficult'. He said that in the current
climate it was not easy to raise prices.
The Bridgestone chairman said US tyre sales in general should rise by about
10 per cent this year from their 1991 level in volume terms.
Mr Jean Fourmy, Bridgestone/Firestone Europe chairman, said the French tyre
replacement market rose slightly in the first half of 1992 but had fallen
sharply since then.
The group expected a decline in the volume of sales for the full year, he
said. He added that Bridgestone France and Firestone France would merge in
1993 but retain separate brand names and distribution networks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Park Tae-joon, the chairman and founder of South Korea's Pohang Iron and
Steel (Posco), yesterday offered his resignation a week before the company
was scheduled to open its share register to foreign investors.
Political factors appeared to have prompted Mr Park's decision, although his
request has not yet been approved by the company's board of directors.
Some analysts believe that the resignation offer by Mr Park, a leading
figure in the ruling Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), may be a preliminary
step to his leaving the party in order to support a rival candidate in the
December presidential election.
Mr Park was thwarted in his bid to become DLP presidential candidate earlier
this year. News of his resignation sent Posco's shares tumbling on the Seoul
stock market.
Posco, which is 30 per cent controlled by the government, is next week
expected to approve new rules allowing foreign investors to acquire up to 10
per cent of Posco stock.
The company is the second highest capitalised company on the Korean
exchange, accounting for 2 per cent of the total stock market value.
The government is offering foreigners shares in Posco and Korea Electric
Power Corp (Kepco), another state-run company and the country's largest
capitalised concern, in a bid to revive the sluggish Korean stock market.
Mr Park offered his resignation less than a week after Posco inaugurated a
fourth furnace at its Kwangyang complex, making it the world's third-biggest
steel producer.
'My understanding is that he has made up his mind to resign now that the
work of building a great steel industry is completed,' said an aide to Mr
Park.
Mr Park, a former military officer, was appointed by the government in 1967
to establish Posco as one of the main engines behind South Korea's push for
industrialisation. He established the Pohang steel complex in south-east
Korea and later expanded operations to Kwangyang on the southern coast.

COLOR LINE, the Norwegian ferry operator, unveiled record pre-tax profits of
NKr132m (Dollars 22.9m) for the first eight months of this year. This
compares with a NKr2m loss in the same period last year.
The return to profit stemmed largely from a marked increase in the volume of
traffic in most of its ferry routes.
Color Line said there had been an especially strong increase in traffic on
its Bergen/Stavanger-Newcastle line. Net operating income in the period rose
to NKr1.07bn from NKr978m last year.
Mr Jon Erik Nygaard, managing director, forecast a small increase in profits
for the year as a whole, and said the company was considering refinancing
long-term debt of NKr1.5bn. He forecast annual market growth of 6 per cent
to 7 per cent, slightly lower than recent years.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Matsushita backs film image for
its future - Steven Butler and Emiko Terazono assess the Japanese group's
takeover of MCA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER and EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCENES from popular US movies such as ET and Back to the Future have begun
to enliven advertisements in Japan for electronic goods made by Matsushita
Electric Industrial, one of the world's biggest consumer electronics
companies, whose brands include Panasonic, Technics, and Quasar.
Matsushita owns rights to the images following its controversial Dollars
6.1bn acquisition nearly two years ago of MCA, the US film, music and
publishing group that owns Universal Studios.
Yet Matsushita's expensive plunge into the US entertainment business does
not appear to be yielding - or even promising - much in the way of benefits
besides the glittering images.
Indeed, Matsushita's long-term plans for MCA, and how entertainment fits
strategically with its electronics business, are as murky as they were on
the day of the acquisition.
Perhaps worse, the acquisition has become an expensive financial drain as
Matsushita's traditional electronic equipment or hardware business is in
trouble. Matsushita said pre-tax profits in the six months to the end of
September were likely to fall 53 per cent to Y50bn (Dollars 402m), a meagre
2.2 per cent return on sales of Y2,250bn.
This is not how Matsushita sees the acquisition officially, although
privately some Matsushita employees question the wisdom of owning MCA.
Mr Mamoru Furuichi, a director with responsibility for MCA since February,
last week gave one of Matsushita's most extensive explanations to date of
how it sees its entertainment business.
He said: 'We think that our efforts will bear fruit in the future. What
these will be, we can't tell yet. We are thinking in a span of 10 years.'
It is characteristic of Japanese corporate management that Mr Furuichi
prefers not to talk about the short-term, but the short-term results of the
acquisition have been dismal.
Last year, Matsushita's operating profits from entertainment were only
Y20.6bn, roughly a 2.7 per cent return on the investment. Mr Furuichi says
this year MCA profits are expected to climb by double digits, yet to make
short-term financial sense, growth in triple digits would be required.
The cost of the acquisition has weighed heavily on Matsushita's balance
sheet. The company went from a net cash position of Y354bn in March 1990 to
hold a net debt of Y1,220bn, or 35 per cent of equity, in March this year.
Matsushita is a strong company and this level of debt puts no serious
strains on it. Yet the question is whether Matsushita used its cash wisely.
Matsushita bought a company that was in good health. It went to pains to
retain the MCA management, including the successful team of Mr Lew Wasserman
and Mr Sidney Sheinberg. And after the acquisition, it adopted a hands-off
policy. 'The first year was to get to know each other,' said Mr Furuichi.
Just after the acquisition Matsushita set up an executive committee composed
of Matsushita and MCA executives whose aim was to advise the MCA board of
directors. This March, the executive committee set up three sub-committees,
one to take a broad look at the future of the industry, one to explore the
possibility of co-operative development projects between Matsushita and MCA,
and one to look at financial issues.
Matsushita hopes to broaden the use of high definition video equipment in
the entertainment industry. It is brainstorming with MCA in the multi-media
field - an as-yet vaguely defined class of future electronics products that
will combine video, digital sound, telecommunications, and computing. Mr
Furuichi says Matsushita has a lot to learn from MCA, and is hoping some of
the creative tradition at Universal Studios will rub off on the company. At
Universal City, the Hollywood theme park, Steven Spielberg is to design a
Panasonic Pavilion as a showcase for Matsushita's electronic hardware.
Very broadly, Matsushita sees room for MCA to expand its business in Europe
and Asia.
All these activities are no doubt sound, and in spite of some reports of
unhappiness at MCA, Matsushita cannot be accused of mismanaging its
subsidiary.
Even so, it is striking that two years after spending Dollars 6.1bn, plans
for MCA's development still appear to be at the formative stage at best.
This leads to the inevitable conclusion that Matsushita, in spite of much
talk at the time about synergy, never had a concrete vision about how
Matsushita's hardware and MCA's software businesses would fit together.
Rather, the acquisition may well have been a defensive move out of fears
that Matsushita would be out in the cold should Sony, its domestic rival,
make a success of its Dollars 3.4bn acquisition of Columbia Pictures a year
earlier.
In contrast to Matsushita, Sony bought a studio that was in trouble, and may
have in the end invested as much as Dollars 8bn in acquiring a range of film
and music interests, including Columbia Records. Matsushita was widely seen
as having done the better deal.
In the end, though, Sony managed to turn Columbia into the leading US film
studio last year, with 20 per cent of the US box office take. Sony's
entertainment profits grew to Y53.2bn, a barely acceptable (for a Japanese
company) financial return of roughly 5.3 per cent, at least for one year.
It is difficult to see how Matsushita will match this sort of performance on
a sustained basis, although Mr Furuichi's vision might turn out to be right
and all that is needed is patience.
Perhaps the more realistic financial measure of the investment would be
Matsushita's entertainment profits as a ratio to what MCA would sell for
today, which may be reasonably high after all.

MR PETER Barnett, chief executive of Pasminco, the Australian zinc and lead
producer, expects the company to return to profitability in the year to June
1993, AP-DJ reports from Melbourne.
'The good operating performance of 1991-92 has continued into the 1992-93
year and unless Australian-dollar metal prices decline significantly,
Pasminco should return to profits in the current year,' Mr Barnett said in
his annual report.
Pasminco reported net losses of ADollars 58.6m (USDollars 41.8m) for the
year to June 1992, widening from year-earlier losses of ADollars 47.6m. The
losses were caused by low world metal prices and one-time factors. The
company also reported it cut costs in the year and returned to profitability
by August, when the Australian currency fell against the US dollar and metal
prices rallied.
Lead and zinc metal prices trended up in the July-September quarter, but
they have slipped in the past two weeks.

UNITED SAUDI Commercial Bank reports a 21 per cent increase in net profits
to SR152.7m (Dollars 40.72m) for the third quarter of 1992, AP-DJ reports
from Manama.
USCB said it has sustained growth in quarterly earnings 'despite an
uninterrupted decline in interest rates and extreme volatilities in the
world financial markets'.
The bank said it had adopted a new strategy, diverting resources 'from
low-yielding interbank assets to investment and customer loans, thereby
improving net returns on available funds'.
USCB loans and advances rose 55 per cent to SR3.40bn while investments
surged 57 per cent to SR2.36bn.
Total assets at the end of September jumped 16 per cent to SR9.00bn a year
earlier.
Shareholders' funds were up 34 per cent to SR765.1m 'due to retention of
operation earnings', the bank said.
However, customer deposits increased by only 11 per cent to SR5.93 bn.
The bank said it lowered its provision for possible loan losses to SR22.5m
from SR25m the previous year, due to an 'emphasis on credit quality and
improvement in the bank's classified risk portfolio'.
USCB was set up in 1983 out of a merger of the local branches of Bank Melli
Iran, Banque Du Liban &amp; D'outre Mer and United Bank of Pakistan.
The three banks retain a joint 30 per cent stake in the USCB, with Saudi
private shareholders owning the remaining 70 per cent.

Loan losses totalled SKr10.01bn, exceeding two-thirds of the level forecast

figure.
The bank said that its profits before loan losses for the May to August
period only 'increased insignificantly' but it did not provide a figure. It
added that operating profits before loan losses for the first eight months
totalled SKr1.59bn, a 55 per cent decline on the same period of 1991.
Nordbanken said the 'poor trend of earnings' was expected to continue for
the rest of the year. It pointed out that the high market interest rates in
Sweden now increased the risk of further credit losses as the recession
deepened. 'The bank's earning capacity is at present undermined by a
substantial increase in non-performing assets,' said Nordbanken.
The bank is no longer listed on the stock market as it became wholly-owned
by the state in the middle of last month.
'Nordbanken's loan losses still remain very high,' said Mr Olle Wastberg,
under-secretary at the Ministry of Finance. But he added that this would not
'jeopardise depositors' funds or the reconstruction of the bank'.
At the end of this year, non-performing loans, loans with negotiated
interest deferments and other assets that hamper the bank's earning power,
are to be transferred to a new company called Securum which will be
wholly-owned by the Swedish government and separate from Nordbanken.
The government will announce a rescue plan for the bank shortly after
today's opening of the new session of parliament. Its aim is to strengthen
the bank's financial base so that its capital adequacy requirement ratio
will exceed the 8 per cent required by the end of the year under the rules
of the Bank for International Settlements.
The depths of the crisis at Nordbanken can be gauged by the size of their
non-performing assets which were SKr32bn at the end of August. Nordbanken
revealed yesterday that the reserve for possible loan losses was SKr16.6bn
which covered only 52 per cent of the total.
The net amount of non-performing assets at the bank had risen to SKr15.2bn
compared with SKr9.9bn at the start of the year and SKr12.7bn at the end of
April.
The bank said that the volume of outstanding loans with interest deferment
agreements rose during the year to SKr6.5bn from SKr3.8bn and pledges taken
over by the bank for protection of its claims rose by nearly SKr1bn to
SKr7.4bn.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Stora suffers SKr383m shortfall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<TEXT>
STORA, Europe's largest pulp and paper group, suffered a SKr383m (Dollars
71m) loss in the second four months of the year. This contrasts with a
SKr860m profit it made for the same period of 1991 and a SKr3m profit for
the first four months of this year.
Invoiced sales fell to SKr31.07bn for the first eight months, from
SKr34.87bn for the same period of last year.
Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive, said the company would suffer a further
deficit in the final four months of this year. Earlier assessments had
assumed a summer business recovery in the US which did not happen. The
decline in the dollar exchange rate also resulted in further pressure on
prices.
Stora said the forest products industry continues to face a 'substantial
degree of overcapacity'. As a result, prices have had to be cut severely
with falls as big as 23 per cent in newspaper print and 11 per cent in fine
paper.
The company's loss would have been much higher but for a rationalisation
programme. The drop of SKr2.65bn in revenues was partly offset by SKr1.4bn
savings so far this year with SKr800m of that coming in the second four
months. Costs will be cut by a further SKr300m in the third four months.
Stora said it plans further restructuring to reduce costs by a further
SKr1bn next year and by SKr1bn in 1994. The workforce was being cut from
45,643 at the end of 1990 to just over 39,000 by December. Productivity has
risen 12 per cent this year.
However, the company said the present worries in Sweden's financial markets
had not affected the group's position. Interest-bearing net indebtedness
actually fell to SKr23.71bn at the end of August from SKr24.74bn at the
beginning of the year.
Stora's pulp business made a SKr239m operating loss in the first eight
months compared with a SKr89m loss for the same period of last year, mainly
due to falling pulp prices.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Showdown for Austria's Giro bank
 -Opposition to its expansion strategy mounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SIMMERING row over the future of GiroCredit Bank, Austria's third-largest
bank, has exploded into public view, with Bank Austria, Giro's largest
shareholder, declaring publicly that it opposes Giro management's expansion
strategy.
The way is now set for a showdown at the meeting of Giro's supervisory board
on October 15, when Mr Hans Haumer, the chief executive, is to put forward a
plan to buy 10 per cent stakes in two large provincial savings banks.
Giro, the former Girozentrale, has been struggling to transform itself into
a universal bank following the liberalisation of the Austrian banking
industry in the past two years.
Giro has been the central deposit body where the Austrian savings banks have
been obliged to put their excess funds, and so therefore has operated mainly
as a wholesale bank, active in domestic and foreign capital markets. Now the
savings banks can deposit their funds on the open market and obtain much
better returns than from Giro, whose rates are still regulated.
Late last year, Giro embarked on a strategy of developing its own branch
network, acquiring Osterreichisches Credit-Institut (OCI) for Sch2.5bn
(Dollars 259m). OCI has 47 retail branches.
However, opportunities for other acquisitions are few and expensive.
Recently, Giro proposed another tactic to achieve the same end - buying 10
per cent stakes in some of the larger provincial savings banks. It hopes
this will encourage them to continue doing business with the central body.
Giro has already agreed terms with two of these banks, Salzburger Sparkasse,
in Salzburg, and Allgemeine Sparkasse Oberosterreich in Linz.
And this was the point at which Bank Austria, the country's largest bank,
objected. Giro is owned by 95 savings banks throughout the country. Bank
Austria is the largest with a 30 per cent stake by virtue of its control of
the big Zentralsparkasse group of savings banks in Vienna.
Up to now, Bank Austria and Die Erste, a competing group of Vienna-based
savings banks with about a 20 per cent stake in Giro, have led rival
consortia of urban and rural savings banks on the Giro board, divided along
partisan political lines.
The result is that even though Bank Austria and Die Erste together together
accounted for a majority of the votes on the Giro board, they have never
acted together. At the moment they control only seven of the 20 board seats
between them.
However, now both Bank Austria and Erste see a common interest as
Vienna-based banks eager to improve their market share in the provinces in
preventing Giro from strengthening its position in the country's main
provincial cities.
Mr Gerhard Randa, deputy chief executive of Bank Austria, said publicly
recently that he thought Giro should concentrate its efforts on its
speciality of wholesale banking and that investments in minority positions
in retail banks did not make good economic sense.
Mr Randa recognised that the Giro board as presently constituted with a
majority of votes still in the hands of the provincial savings banks might
well endorse management's plans. But he said if the vote was lost on October
15, changes to the board's membership should be considered.
Giro officials say the provincial savings banks would be extremely offended
if their representatives were removed from the board, and they are betting
that Bank Austria will not risk undermining the bank's business. 'It is a
bit of a chess game,' one said.
Meanwhile, Giro officials are trying desperately to change the ownership
structure of their bank. It is intolerable having two main competitors as
the two largest shareholders, bank officials say. But the cost of buying out
Bank Austria or Die Erste would be extremely high.
Last year, Giro tried to merge with Die Erste, but that failed for a variety
of reasons. It has been trying for some time to attract 'strategic' minority
shareholders, and is now in discussions with Bayerische Landesbank
Girozentrale, the central deposit bank for a group of German savings banks,
over a 10 per cent stake.
Others wonder if there is room in Austria's overcrowded banking market,
where there are already two large universal banks, Bank Austria and
Creditanstalt, for a third.
Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chief executive of Bank Austria, says his bank will
wait and see whether Giro can find any strategic partners. If not, he
acknowledges that it might have to be taken over by Bank Austria. 'I am sure
we can solve all the problems,' Mr Haiden said.

over debt

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STET, the Italian public-sector telecommunications group controlled by the
Iri state holding company, ran into fierce investor criticism yesterday of
its L700bn (Dollars 561m) plan to buy the Finsiel software group.
Shares in Stet fell by 23 per cent on a wave of sales by minority
shareholders in protest at the nature and presentation of the deal to
purchase Iri's 83.3 per cent stake in Finsiel. Ordinary shares in Stet fell
to L1,035 - virtually half their level of four months ago.
Analysts and bankers reacted with almost universal hostility to the
purchase, which they dismissed as little more than a book-keeping exercise
to reduce Iri's indebtedness at the expense of Stet's minority shareholders.
'This harks back to the very worst days of the Andreotti government', said
one banker. 'It goes completely against what the new government has been
saying about privatisation. I hope prime minister Giuliano Amato will
reverse it.'
Bankers also objected to the timing of the surprise transaction, sprung late
on Friday afternoon. The objections follow similar criticisms in June, when
Iri made a poorly-managed announcement of a secondary placement of a 16 per
cent of Stet's shares.
Stet justified the purchase on the grounds of the growing synergies between
telecommunications and software companies, and criticised what it termed as
the 'speculative attack' on its shares. The price was reasonable and well
within its means.
Analysts said the deal was devised after last year's calls by Mr Carlo De
Benedetti to merge Finsiel, Italy's biggest software house, with Olivetti
Information Services, the software operation controlled by the Olivetti
computers group. Mr De Benedetti controls Olivetti through his quoted Cir
holding company.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Aegis plans to cancel its market listings
in New York and Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS, the media buying group, is cancelling its listings in Paris and New
York with effect from October 30.
Aegis has analysed trading in its shares for the first eight months of 1992
and found that more than 99 per cent of all trading volume was conducted in
London.
'London is where all the liquidity is, where all the institutions want to
deal, whatever their nationality. All our banking and brokering arrangements
are in London, so London seemed the logical place for the company to be
listed,' the company said.
Aegis estimated that the withdrawal would mean annual savings of more than
Pounds 250,000.
The delisting puzzled some analysts yesterday . Aegis' shares have collapsed
from more than 200p a year ago to 17p yesterday.
'It's a thoroughly negative move. With the company's decision to relocate
its headquarters from London to Paris, it was more important to develop the
French listing rather than get rid of it,' said one.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Microfilm Reprographics static at Pounds
8.23m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICROFILM Reprographics, the microfilming bureau which has large operations
in both the UK and US, yesterday posted flat full year pre-tax profits, but
nevertheless increased its dividend by 20 per cent.
Pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.23m in the year to June 30 compared with profits
of Pounds 8.19m last time and came from turnover which slipped slightly to
Pounds 33.7m (Pounds 34.4m).
The results reflect the impact of the recession on both sides of the
Atlantic and the effects of the particularly weak dollar on US earnings,
partly offset by higher net interest income.
Although the latest results are a sharp contrast to those in the late 1980s,
which saw double digit profit and turnover growth in successive years, the
group's board said recent acquisitions 'should add significantly' to the
progress from its traditional business and expects 1993 'will be a
particularly successful year.'
Earnings per share in the latest full year grew to 10.6p (10.4p) out of
which the group is paying a final dividend of 2.88p per share (2.4p) making
a total of 4.32p per share, up from 3.6p a year earlier.
During the year the group acquired Memex Information Systems, an information
retrieval software company, Sol Microfilm, Micro Reid and DPTS, which is
involved in data storage and retrieval primarily for the oil industry.
Since the end of its financial year the group has made two further
acquisitions as part of its strategy to broaden the range and geographic
area of services it can offer.
Atlanta-based Fort Knox Secured Data Storage was acquired at the end of July
for an initial consideration of Dollars 860,000. A Dollars 300,000
consulting agreement will also be paid to a former stockholder over a
four-year period.
Fort Knox provides high security storage and retrieval of paper and magnetic
media and will be merged with the group's existing Atlanta office.
In addition Microfilm acquired NCR's computer output microfilm (COM) bureau
business last month for an initial cash payment of Pounds 1m. A deferred
payment of Pounds 1 will be paid for every Pounds 1 of COM turnover over
Pounds 1m in the next 12 months.
NCR's COM bureau operates from four sites in the UK and had turnover in the
year to November 30 last year of Pounds 1.43m. Its operations are being
merged with Microfilm Reprographics' existing computer output microfilm
business.
Despite the expenditure on the acquisitions the group ended the year with
cash reserves of Pounds 8.3m, up Pounds 1.8m from a year earlier.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STYLO, the footwear manufacturer and retailer, cut its pre-tax losses from
Pounds 5.67m to Pounds 2.65m in the six months to August 1. The company said
there had been an improvement in almost all divisions.
Mr Arnold Ziff, chairman, said that if the present trend continued he hoped
that the Bradford-based company would be in profit at the end of the year.
Last year there was a loss of Pounds 9.06m.
He added that the improvement had continued in the first few weeks of the
second half.
Turnover for the period was up from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 46.7m and there
was a trading profit of Pounds 1.6m, against losses of Pounds 1.97m. The net
interest charge increased to Pounds 2.76m (Pounds 2.26m).
Losses per share emerged at 13.16p (29.62p).

<TEXT>
GREENALLS Group, which operates the De Vere hotel chain, has bought the
Belton Woods hotel and country club in Grantham, Lincolnshire, for Pounds
10.3m.
The acquisition, from administrative receivers KPMG Peat Marwick, of the
96-bedroom hotel and 36-hole golf complex brings the number of leisure
resort hotels in the De Vere chain to three. It already owns The Belfry and
Mottram Hall in Cheshire.
De Vere, which operates 25 hotels, plans to concentrate on golfing, business
and conference hotels. Mr Andrew Thomas, Greenalls' chairman and chief
executive, said: 'Our experience shows that the demand from both business
and leisure for golf-related four star hotels is growing.'
The group opened a new hotel in Swindon earlier this year and recently
opened a Pounds 10m extension to the Grand Hotel in Brighton.
Profits from the group's hotel operations declined by 11 per cent to Pounds
6m in the half-year to March. However, last year the division contributed
Pounds 15.58m - 20 per cent of the group's operating profits.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Nightmare on the high street for UK
retailers - Tenants and landlords in battle over terms of occupation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT A CBI conference held yesterday to discuss the future of commercial
leases, Mr David Stathers, director of estates at Boots the Chemist, flashed
up a slide to illustrate the relationship between landlord and tenant.
It showed two rams charging headlong at each other.
'I take the view that the current arrangements that govern the terms of
occupation between landlord and tenant create conflict,' he said.
That conflict has become all too apparent in recent months as the severity
of the recession has exposed the severe stresses and strains in the
commercial property sector.
Retailers have staged rent strikes against what they regard as 'excessive'
increases and have begun to lobby vigorously for reform of the 25 year
lease, with upwards-only rent reviews every five years, which is almost
unknown outside the UK.
The debate was further fuelled by a recent inflammatory study by Professor
John Burton, an economist from Birmingham University, which claimed the
structural rigidities of the rental market had created a situation of
'nightmarish crisis in many components of UK retailing'. He argued that
commercial leases represented an 'institutionalised, legally induced form of
cost inflation that is very impervious to market forces' and should be
reformed by government statute.
This proposal has prompted a furious response from the property industry,
which promises to fight any changes to existing leases tooth and nail.
For one thing, the property industry believes the changes suggested by Mr
Burton would severely damage property values by destroying the security of
investors' income. 'It would be devastating. It would send the market into
turmoil,' says Mr Richard Lay, chairman of Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, the
property adviser.
For another, landlords argue that contracts freely entered into should be
upheld. The Prudential, one of the country's largest property investors,
says it would appeal to the European Court to overturn any moves to the
contrary, which it claims would amount to confiscation.
Landlords do not even agree with the proposition that the existing system is
inflationary and unfair on tenants. Mr Christopher Edwards, director of
Property Portfolio Management at the Prudential, maintains that five yearly
review patterns cushion tenants against annual rent rises. He estimates that
on average UK tenants were paying just 60-70 per cent of market rents at the
end of last year.
Moreover, landlords point out that tenants benefited from the existing
system in the 1980s, by assigning their unwanted leases to other traders in
return for large premiums. They also maintain that retailers are suffering
from the consequences of their own actions, by bidding up rents to
unsustainable levels in the late 1980s
But their overriding argument is that ultimately tenants' interests coincide
with their landlords. If leases became more flexible, institutions would
invest less in property, the supply of new buildings would dry up and rents
would rise. 'The simple truth is that any increase in the investor's risk
will have to be paid for,' says Mr Edwards.
Tenants identify their most pressing concerns as:
An end to 25-year leases. Although tenants like a degree of security they
dislike the financial responsibility and inflexibility associated with such
long leases.
An end to upwards-only clauses in rent reviews. The upwards-only ratchet is
seen as unfair and inflationary, at a time when rents on new leases are
falling.
An end to 'privity of contract', which allows landlords in England and Wales
to claim unpaid rent from previous tenants if the existing tenant defaults.
The Conservative party manifesto at the last election promised to consider
changes, after an outcry from companies which were faced with crippling
demands for rent under leases they passed on years ago. In its latest set of
accounts, for example, Boots took a Pounds 5.8m provision against the
anticipated costs relating to transferred leases where the assignees had
defaulted.
Changes to the method of determining rent reviews to reflect the quantity of
vacant property on the market, the state of the economy, the ability of
tenants to pay and concessions granted to new tenants, such as rent-free
periods.
An end to confidentiality clauses, which critics claim obscure and often
inflate market rents by deliberately limiting the information essential for
an efficient market.
Despite the rhetoric of many property investors, the structure of new leases
is already changing. Investment companies, which do not need to sell their
properties to institutions, are already granting flexible leases. MEPC, the
UK's second largest property company, recently gave Chemical Bank the right
to break its lease on Alban Gate, its City flagship, after one, five and
fifteen years.
Property owners are making a virtue out of the need to grant shorter leases,
which forces them to work their property more energetically. 'For too long
landlords have been passive, absent rent collectors but they have to become
more involved in actively managing their property assets,' says Mr Roger
Carey, managing director of Slough Estates.
There is also a growing acceptance that the rent review process should be
improved. Confidentiality clauses have few defenders and arbitrators are
taking more account of the state of the economy when deciding rent reviews.
Some concessions on privity of contract would also be accepted by landlords.
The CBI, for instance, has support for its proposal that tenants get an
automatic right to reoccupy premises for which they have become liable.
Modest amendments like these have a good chance of being adopted. But while
some practices are gradually evolving in the light of new market conditions,
there is little prospect of root and branch reform to the underlying
structure.
The conflict between the immediate pressures of the recession and the long
term investment horizons of institutions is unlikely to be resolved.
