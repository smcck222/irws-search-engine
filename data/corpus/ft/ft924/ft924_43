FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Abbot offer for Blystad goes unconditional
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE offer for Blystad, the Norwegian-controlled group which owns KCA
Drilling, the profitable oil services company, was made unconditional
yesterday.
Abbot Holdings, a private company set up for the purpose of the bid by Mr
Alistair Locke, yesterday said it had received irrevocable acceptances for
its offer from shareholders speaking for 65.2 per cent of Blystad shares.
Acceptances related to the stake controlled by the three Blystad brothers
who are directors.
Last week the Takeover Panel ruled that the bid could proceed, dismissing an
argument from independent directors that there had been an arrangement
between the Blystad brothers and Abbot.
The Bank of Ireland, Abbot's advisers, estimates that the present value of
Abbot preference shares being offered to Blystad shareholders is 5.4p.
This represents a 20 per cent premium to the 4.5p Blystad share price before
the bid. This preference share offer values Blystad at Pounds 7.5m.
Blystad has not paid a dividend for seven years.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Non-core side blamed for GM Firth loss
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GM Firth, Wakefield-based steel stockholder, reported a sharp jump in
pre-tax losses to Pounds 4.86m in the year to March 31, against Pounds
727,000, which included losses of Pounds 164,000 from discontinued
activities.
Mr Michael Wilkinson, chairman, said while the group suffered badly from the
severe economic downturn the main contributors to the disappointing result
were non-core activities.
Sales of continuing activities fell 23 per cent to Pounds 43.1m (Pounds
56.1m) for an operating loss of Pounds 2.89m (profit of Pounds 1.63m).
Interest charges fell to Pounds 1.97m (Pounds 2.19m).
A Pounds 707,000 loss in the steel division (profit of Pounds 1.47m) in
depressed market conditions included considerable provisions against stock
values.
Losses per share rose to 12.27p (2.5p). The final dividend is again being
passed as was the interim. Last year an interim of 1p was the only payment.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax profits of the Chillington Corporation showed a marked upturn, from
Pounds 109,000 to Pounds 424,000, in the six months to June 30. Turnover
dipped slightly from Pounds 27.5m to Pounds 24.2m.
The company, which has interests in engineering, plantations commodities,
property and investments, said improved results had been achieved in all
divisions, with tropical agriculture, agricultural hand tools and UK trading
each achieving increased profits.
Losses in the manufactured products division had been substantially reduced
and it had been trading profitably since April.
Earnings emerged at 0.01p (losses 2.09p). The directors are deferring any
decision on the payment of an ordinary dividend until the year end - an
interim of 0.5p was paid previously.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Oriel disposal as profits decline
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oriel Group, the USM-quoted insurance broker, yesterday announced the sale
of its general insurance broking division and a downturn in profits for the
six months ended June 30.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds 1.2m and earnings per share
to 5.27p (7.55p). However, the interim dividend is being increased to 2p
(1.8p).
The directors estimated that the disposal of the general insurance broking
division to Jardine Insurance Brokers for Pounds 5.4m in cash would lead to
an exceptional profit of about Pounds 1.5m at the year-end after the
write-back of goodwill and related costs.
They said the sale would lead to a substantial reduction in head office
overheads, would eliminate group borrowings and would give scope to fund
further acquisitions in specialist insurance areas.
As a result of the disposal, Mr Martin Harridine, deputy chairman, will
leave the group to join Jardine Insurance Brokers.

profits of Pounds 125,000 for the first six months of 1992 compared with

With no sign of an improvement in the construction sector, the USM-quoted

Turnover increased to Pounds 11.3m (Pounds 10.5m) but pressure on margins
continued. The company said profits were struck after bad debts of Pounds

PRE-TAX losses for the year to end-March at Raglan Property Trust were
Pounds 1.6m, against Pounds 4m at the previous year-end. Turnover increased
from Pounds 7.06m to Pounds 9.49m.
The pre-tax improvement was achieved after a reduced charge of Pounds
960,000 (Pounds 3.62m) for property write-offs.
Losses per share were cut to 0.9p (2p).
The directors said the company was continuing to reduce its indebtedness and
to unwind outstanding development liabilities initiated in the late-1980s.
Litigation with Security Pacific National Bank had been settled at a figure
significantly below the claim and had been provided for in the 1991
accounts, they added.
Having considerably reduced debt, the directors are addressing the task of
restructuring the group's balance sheet.
Discussions are under way with its three leading banks on a capital
restructuring in order that negotiations with another party could be
pursued.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Trafalgar House stands ground over 1991
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the property, construction and engineering group, is
determined not to restate its 1991 financial results following an
investigation by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the new accounting
standards watchdog.
Trafalgar, which is under siege from Hongkong Land, has told the panel that
it is willing to change its accounting policies by transferring property
developments from fixed to current assets.
But according to one of its financial advisers it is adamant that it should
not have to restate last year's figures.
If Trafalgar's write-downs of wholly-owned properties and associates had
been deducted from the profit and loss account they would have severely
reduced last year's Pounds 122.4m pre-tax profits.

Korean insurer
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMERCIAL Union, the UK composite insurer, yesterday announced a
co-operation agreement with one of South Korea's leading general insurance
companies, Hyundai Marine and Fire Insurance.
CU will provide underwriting and servicing facilities to Korean clients
introduced by Hyundai.
The agreement also provides for exchange of market information and mutual
co-operation in areas like training.
Hyundai Marine and Fire is a subsidiary of the Hyundai Business Group, one
of the largest of the Korean conglomerates.
Hyundai's insurance operations outside Korea include underwriting operations
in Japan and representative offices in London, New York and Singapore.
The agreement is one of a number signed in recent years by UK composite
companies with partners in South Korea, Japan and other Far Eastern markets.
The composites are keen to develop connections in markets which are
gradually liberalising and are seen to have good long-term potential.
CU itself was the first UK insurer to establish a liaison office in South
Korea in 1989.
More recently Sun Alliance has linked up with Lucky Insurance.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Asset switch creates consternation - Andrew
Jack on reaction to Trafalgar House's accounting practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTING policies adopted in the 1991 accounts by Trafalgar House, the
property, construction and engineering group, helped trigger a
double-pronged attack from the UK's standards setters earlier this year.
The company's decision to switch a series of properties from current to
fixed assets and then write them down caused considerable controversy and
concern among commentators.
The tangible fixed assets notes in the accounts show Pounds 155.4m
reclassified from current assets, offset by a Pounds 68m write-down or
'deficit on valuation'. The fixed assets investment note shows a write-down
of Pounds 34.7m from the 'revaluation of property associates'.
Both assets were previously treated as development properties, a type of
current asset which has to be shown at the lower of cost or net realisable
value under the requirements of the 1985 Companies Act.
That would have required write-downs totalling Pounds 102.7m in the profit
and loss account, reducing pre-tax profits from the stated Pounds 122.4m to
Pounds 19.7m, and a corresponding reduction in assets.
Instead, the adjustments have all been made on the balance sheet, changing a
revaluation reserve of Pounds 84m in the previous year to a deficit of
Pounds 18.7m.
'The treatment adopted gave rise to some interest,' said Mr Chris Nunn, a
technical partner with accountants Arthur Andersen. 'Nobody could say it was
wrong, but there was certainly some difference of views.'
On one hand, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the recently-created
watchdog of accounting standards, launched an investigation into the
specific circumstances surrounding Trafalgar's decision.
On the other, the Urgent Issues Task Force of the Accounting Standards Board
(ASB), which drafts new standards, began work on an opinion which would
scrutinise existing guidelines and rule on future practice.
It did not mention the company by name, but Trafalgar House is widely
accepted to have been the trigger for action. There was a need for
clarification, because the Companies Act did not specify how transfers
between fixed and current assets should be treated.
The ASB has its own process of devising new standards and putting them out
to consultation before they are adopted into the canon of acceptable
accounting practices. But it delegates to the task force matters of pressing
concern on which it wants to act more swiftly.
Ironically, the task force has already taken action on the subject, issuing
its fifth piece of guidance or 'abstract' in July, which will not allow
Trafalgar's approach to be repeated. It comes into force for year ends on or
after December 23 this year.
It states that any transfer from current to fixed assets must be made at the
lower of cost and net realisable value. If there has been a diminution in
value, that should be charged to the profit and loss account, reflecting the
loss while it was a current asset.
Meanwhile, the review panel is continuing to negotiate with Trafalgar House.
While the company has made a statement suggesting that it will not repeat
the treatment in the future, discussions are continuing on whether it will
be required to restate its 1991 accounts.
It is issuing a circular to shareholders today which is expected to contain
some clarification. One extreme would be for the review panel to force
Trafalgar to go to the expense of re-issuing its 1991 accounts to all
shareholders, amended to reflect the changes. The panel is more likely to
accept a reworking of the 1991 figures in the next annual report.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Sage expands via buys in France and the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAGE GROUP, the Newcastle-based accounting software supplier, is paying an
initial Pounds 4.4m cash for two acquisitions, one in France, its first in
mainland Europe, the other in the US.
It is paying FFr12.5m (Pounds 1.4m) for 95 per cent of Ciel, a Paris-based
software house - like Sage, a fast-growing supplier of accounting software
for small businesses.
There are further revenue-related payments for the former owners, who are
staying on as management, to a maximum of Pounds 5m during the next two
years.
The remaining five per cent is subject to a put and call agreement,
providing further incentive for the former owners to improve revenues and
profits.
Last year, Ciel's sales were more than FFr18.9m and are expected to be more
than FFr25m this year. It is profitable with more than 800 new users each
month, but Mr David Goldman, Sage chairman, said the company had yet to
exploit recurring revenues from sales of maintenance and stationery.
He expected gross profit margins of above 25 per cent eventually.
Sage is paying Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.3m) for Remote Control International, a
supplier of sales automation software based in San Diego, California. Again
there are further revenue-based payments to a maximum of Dollars 7m. RCI has
some 250,000 customers, including Sage, for its Dollars 695 'TeleMagic'
package.
Mr Goldman said there was good synergy between TeleMagic and Sage's
accounting packages. Other software suppliers were also writing packages to
run with TeleMagic. The market for sales automation software was set to rise
from Dollars 166m in 1992 to Dollars 2.5bn in 1997, according to market
intelligence surveys, he added.

FT  06 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Discounting leaves Silentnight down 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SILENTNIGHT Holdings, Europe's biggest manufacturer of beds, said that
sterling's devaluation was bad news for the UK furniture trade because it
would lead to higher import costs.
The Lancashire-based company said the precise impact the lower pound would
make was difficult to predict at this stage, but estimated that 20 per cent
of its raw materials were imported.
Silentnight blamed a prolonged period of discounting by UK retailers for an
11 per cent drop in its pre-tax profits to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 4.62m) in the
six months to August 1.
However, turnover rose by 7 per cent to Pounds 70.5m (Pounds 65.6m), and the
group said its market share had increased.
Mr Bill Davies, executive chairman of the family-controlled group, said:
'Further reductions in UK interest rates would assist with a much-needed
recovery of consumer confidence.'
Mr Davies said the discounting had been an attempt by retailers to stimulate
sales.
'Determined efforts are being made to recover margins in the second half,
and some early signs of improvements are evident.'
Sales by the beds division, rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 45.23m, and trading
profits advanced from Pounds 43.2m to Pounds 45.2m.
All four businesses saw a reduction in margins, but were profitable and
gained market share.
Sales by the cabinet division increased by 12.5 per cent to Pounds 16.31m
and trading profits rose from Pounds 14.5m to Pounds 16.3m.
Homeworthy continued to grow and held margins, while Silentnight Cabinets
completed its factory extension.
A new German bed and mattress subsidiary, bought in May, added Pounds 1.5m
to the international division's trading profits of Pounds 9m (Pounds 7.9m).
It was expected to contribute to the second-half performance at margins
similar to those of the UK businesses.
International sales were down 5 per cent at Pounds 7.49m, with volume in the
north-east of the US depressed by recession.
Earnings per share were 10 per cent lower at 5.98p (6.64p) but the intermim
dividend was maintained at 2.25p.

MR ALAN Sugar, chairman and founder of Amstrad, has transferred his entire
35.4 per cent stake in the consumer electronics group to Amshold, a
newly-created Jersey-based holding company which he wholly owns.
Mr Sugar, who is Amstrad's largest shareholder with 205.6m shares, confirmed
last week that he was considering taking Amstrad private again as the group
reported an unexpectedly large Pounds 70.95m full-year pre-tax loss and
passed its final dividend.
Amstrad has been struggling as a result of savage price cutting in the
personal computer market and shrinking margins in its satellite business.
Mr Sugar is considering the possibility of buying the remaining issued
ordinary shares which he does not own at 30p a share, subject to the
availability of financing.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: Renault calls for Volvo shake-up
and reaffirms alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOLVO, the Swedish car and commercial vehicle maker, must carry out 'a
profound restructuring', Mr Louis Schweitzer, chairman and chief executive
of Renault, its French partner, said yesterday.
Mr Schweitzer said the restructuring of Volvo, which suffered losses in its
car and commercial vehicle operations in the first half of the year, would
be 'painful but necessary'.
It is understood that Renault expects Volvo to be forced to take action to
reduce its present overcapacity, including the possible closure of one or
even both its smaller Swedish assembly plants at Kalmar and Uddevalla.
The Renault chairman, who took over from Mr Raymond Levy in the summer,
voiced support for the alliance. He had 'no doubt of the capacity of Volvo
to carry out' the restructuring.
He said the alliance, in which the two groups hold substantial minority
cross-shareholdings in each other, was 'irrevocable'.
'Renault has no doubts about the benefits of our alliance. There is every
reason for both of us to be tightening our relationship.'
The alliance would be deepened on the basis of maintaining 'two distinct
brand names and identities', said Mr Schweitzer.
Renault, which increased its pre-tax profits fivefold in the first half to
FFr5.44bn (Dollars 1.13bn) from FFr962m in the same period a year ago, had
'prospects for satisfactory profits for the full year even taking into
consideration a considerably more difficult second half'.
He warned that there were as yet no signs of recovery in many European
markets such as Germany, the UK, France, the Netherlands and Switzerland. At
the same time 'sharp trend reversals' had been seen recently in Italy and
Spain, previously the two chief growth markets in Europe in 1992.
Renault had improved its productivity by some 50 per cent between 1985 and
1991, he said. The group's debt no longer constituted a 'major handicap'.
Renault, which has emerged as the fastest-growing volume car maker in Europe
this year, yesterday launched its new Twingo mini car range as a replacement
for its Renault 4 small car.

FT  06 OCT 92 / FDA told SmithKline Beecham's depression drug is safe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ADVISORY committee of the US Food and Drug Administration yesterday voted
unanimously that SmithKline Beecham's anti-depressant, Seroxat, was safe and
effective. The decision paves the way for the drug to be launched next year
in the US, the world's largest market.
The drug, to be known in the US as Paxil, is seen as SmithKline Beecham's
most important new compound, capable of generating worldwide sales of Pounds
350m within three to four years.
Approval of Seroxat has been delayed by concern about the safety of Prozac,
marketed by Eli Lilly of the US. That drug is a selective serotonin
re-uptake inhibitor (SSRI) in the same drug class as Seroxat.
The US anti-depressant market - the largest in the world - has grown from
Pounds 700m in 1989 to about Pounds 1.2bn last year, thanks to greater use
of SSRIs. An estimated 14m Americans - 7 per cent of the US adult population
 -are depressed.
Prozac has captured 50 per cent of the American anti-depressant sector by
value since it came to market in 1989, making it one of the most successful
drug launches ever. Last year Prozac generated revenues of Dollars 910m
(Pounds 511m). Other SSRIs include Solvay's Fluvoxamine, co-marketed by
Upjohn, and Pfizer's Lustral, known in the US as Zoloft.
However, Prozac's sales have been affected by attacks from the Church of
Scientology which claimed Prozac created suicidal thoughts. Last year, an
FDA committee advised there was no causative link between the drug and
suicidal behaviour.
SmithKline Beecham believes Seroxat has fewer side-effects than other
treatments. Studies suggest patients on placebo have more suicidal thoughts
than those on Seroxat.
Seroxat is non-toxic and cannot be successfully used by suicidal people to
kill themselves. By contrast, there are annually in the UK about 500 suicide
fatalities associated with tricyclic anti-depressants, the older and most
common class of drugs used before SSRIs.
Tricyclics still represent 50 per cent of anti-depressant prescriptions.
The psychopharmacological drugs advisory committee's recommendation need not
be followed by the FDA, but that would be unusual.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Marriott to split into two units
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MARRIOTT, the large US hotels and food services group, is to split its
management operations and its property assets into two separate stock market
quoted companies.
Under the 'demerger', Marriott will place its lodging, food and facilities
management operations and its retirement housing in Marriott International.
Shareholders will receive shares in the new company pro rata to their
holdings in Marriott Corporation.
Marriott will retain most of the group's property assets and its airport and
tollroad concessions. This company will be renamed Host Marriott. Shares in
both companies will be listed in New York.
Marriott saw rapid profits growth during the 1980s through a strategy of
developing and selling hotel assets but retaining operating control.
However, the group has since been held back by a heavy debt burden and the
difficulties of offloading property assets in a depressed market.
In 1991 Marriott made an operating profit of Dollars 478m (Pounds 268m) on
sales of Dollars 8.33bn, but profits after tax and interest of only Dollars
82m. Long-term debt (including Dollars 200m of convertible subordinated
debt) at the start of 1992 topped Dollars 3bn.
Mr J. Willard Marriott, chairman, said: 'This transaction will permit
Marriott International to focus its efforts on expansion of management
businesses, where individual opportunities require relatively small amounts
of capital.'
Marriott International will be the larger company, with annual sales (on
1991 figures) of about Dollars 7.4m, and operating cashflow, before
interest, of nearly Dollars 500m. It will take on very little of Marriott's
long-term debt. Chains managed by Marriott include Courtyard, Residence Inn,
Fairfield Inn, Marriott Ownership Resorts and Marriott Hotels.
Host Marriott will have annual sales (on 1991 figures) of Dollars 1.7bn, and
operating cashflow of more than Dollars 350m. It will own 141 Marriott
lodging properties and 16 retirement communities, and retail 'most of
Marriott Corporation's long-term debt obligations'. Marriott rose Dollars 2
1/8 to Dollars 19 1/4 in New York.
The demerger could be completed by mid-1993, conditional on tax and
shareholder approval.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Eurotunnel shares hit by delay warning: Shareholders may be
asked for extra funds as opening date is put back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Eurotunnel yester-day plunged 15 per cent after the group warned
that the opening of the Channel tunnel would be further delayed and that
shareholders might be called upon to put up more cash.
The tunnel is not expected to open until December next year at the earliest
 -six months later than originally planned. Even then the group is unlikely
to have enough locomotives and rolling stock to run a full service until
autumn 1994.
Eurotunnel's share price fell 62p to 358p following the disclosure of more
delays in a letter to shareholders accompanying the group's interim results.
Sir Alastair Morton, Eurotunnel chief executive, said the group had not been
able to establish a final opening date for the tunnel as contractors had not
agreed a settlement over their long-running claim for extra payments.
'The tunnel could open either side of Christmas next year but at the moment
we are working towards an opening date of December 15, 1993,' he said.
No extra funds would be needed until after the tunnel opened when cashflow
problems were likely to arise because of late opening and slow delivery of
trains, he added.
'Most current projections show that we shall have to seek further funds from
various sources, including our shareholders, in 1994 and 1995,' said Sir
Alastair.
Eurotunnel is already in technical breach of its loan covenants and will
need to seek a further waiver from banks at the end of next month to enable
it to continue to draw down funds.
'By then the banks will have been able to study in detail our latest cost
and revenue projections,' said Sir Alastair.
The banks are particularly concerned that they should not be called on to
provide any increase in the loan facilities available to the company.
Independent forecasts published yesterday by Eurotunnel revealed that
revenues in 1994, the first full year of operation, are expected to be
almost Pounds 180m less than had been forcast 10 months ago by the same
consultants.
It was impossible to say how much additional finance, if any, would be
required and how this might be raised, said Sir Alastair. Shareholders,
however, would be very lucky if they received a dividend payment before the
end of the century.
The dispute with contractors over the cost of fitting out the rail tunnels
has yet to be resolved although the gap between the two sides is now less
than Pounds 130m in 1985 prices, according to Sir Alastair.
He said a settlement was almost reached in mid-August when Eurotunnel was
understood to have offered Pounds 1.2bn of which about Pounds 200m was
expected to be in some form of equity including a convertible loan stock.
Contractors, however, were concerned about how the share element was to be
valued.
Sir Alastair said contractors could pursue legal claims against Eurotunnel,
which could take years to resolve, or accept the group's 'final offer'. The
cost of the project has risen since 1987 from Pounds 4.8bn to more than
Pounds 8bn.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Markets blow hot and cold: Yesterday was unsettled, but not
a hurricane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Strong winds in October are a worrying omen for stock market investors. They
remember the gales of October 1987, which caused widespread damage across
northern Europe - just as stock markets around the world began a crash from
which in real terms most of them have still not recovered.
London and Frankfurt, at least, were again seeing seasonally breezy weather
yesterday. And stock markets were again falling: down 4.3 per cent in
Switzerland; 4.3 per cent in France; 3.6 per cent in Germany; 4 per cent in
the UK; and 0.67 per cent in the US.
As in 1987, the damage was not confined to any region of the world. Markets
such as South Africa and Brazil dropped sharply too. And gloom was again
proving proving contagious: the European weakness helped contribute to Wall
Street's morning slide, which in turn helped to worsen the mood during the
European markets' closing hours.
Still, just as a few wind-strewn leaves don't amount to a hurricane, so
yesterday's declines don't necessarily indicate a stock market crash. Since
1987, the markets have learned to take such bumps in their stride: a
mini-crash in October 1990 was reversed promptly enough to leave little
trace in the monthly averages. And, in the US at least, some of the market
practices which arguably worsened the 1987 crash have been altered by
'circuit-breakers' which slow down the self-reinforcing downwards spiral of
equity and futures markets.
For some markets, this was nonetheless the worst one-day drop since 1987.
And for global equity markets as a whole it was one of those synchronised
downwards shift in valuation that only happen every couple of years.
What lies behind this abrupt collective loss of enthusiasm for shares?
Explanations range from the trivial to the profound:
The calendar. Autumn is the last plausible opportunity for stock-market
analysts to cut their perennially over-optimistic estimates of calendar-year
corporate profits. It also coincides with the government budget season in
many countries that sometimes leads to public musings over higher taxes.
Current examples: Germany, Italy, Britain.
Currency turmoil. The wide gap between German and US interest rates hit
currency markets a week or two ago, says Mr Paul Harrison of Salomon
Brothers in London. Now it has affected the equity markets too. 'Each
country's stock market has its own reason for falling,' says Mr Harrison,
'but they are linked by the lack of international co-operation on
interest-rate policy.' In some countries - such as the UK, France, Italy and
Ireland - potential or actual currency weakness had a direct impact on
shares yesterday. In others, the impact was more diffuse - but still
negative.
The German economy. A dire outlook for the German economy is starting to be
reflected in earnings forecasts for individual German companies - starting
with a general downgrading of Volkswagen a few weeks ago and spreading
across the whole of the corporate sector. Nikko Securities, for example,
said in January that it expected German earnings to grow 8 per cent this
year; its forecast is now for a 5 per cent decline.
Blue-chip German companies were among the worst of yesterday's losers:
Volkswagen and Mannesmann both fell 6 per cent, for example. When Germany
sneezes, other economies catch cold; so analysts elsewhere are cutting their
earnings estimates on the assumption that companies in other countries will
suffer from a lack of German orders.
Global portfolio shifts. The people who advise how US institutional
investment portfolios should be allocated between shares, bonds and cash
have made a switch away from equities in recent weeks. Yesterday, for
example, First Boston's investment strategist Mr Rama Krishna recommended
that investors cut the proportion of shares in their portfolios from 65 per
cent to 40 per cent. Other asset-allocators have been making similar
recommendations.
European bourses have been particular victims of a different sort of
portfolio shift: the end of Europhoria. International investors have been
disproportionately heavily invested in European equities since 1985, says Mr
Nick Stevenson of Warburg Securities. Now, with the single market and the
German reunification stories looking stale, 'some of the global funds are
going to start rotating out of continental Europe', he says.
There is one other possible cause for yesterday's market slide: a general
shift towards pessimism, as investors start to think that there is some
possibility, however slight, of a more general economic collapse. Certainly,
the turmoil of the past few weeks has helped to create a sense of markets
swayed by global forces beyond governments' control. But yesterday's selling
was neither heavy nor, in general, panicky; trading volumes in London, for
example, were well below the high levels seen in the upswing that
immediately followed the sterling devaluation. As long as that pattern
holds, the comparison with 1987 will remain an academic one.

FT  06 OCT 92 / People: Rankin goes; Hann arrives
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Lilley, the struggling Glasgow-based construction company which brought
forward the announcement of its interim results to mid-September because its
share price had plummeted, yesterday announced that its chief executive
Robert Rankin has resigned. While chairman Sir Lewis Robertson said he hoped
the results would 'dispel unfounded market concern about the group's
position', the share price has hardly moved since then. Yesterday it stood
at 6 1/2 p.
While the company looks for a new chief executive, chairman Sir Lewis is
bringing in James Hann (right) as deputy chairman, 'on a part-time but
executive basis'. They will jointly assume responsibility for the executive
management of Lilley until a replacement is found, Sir Lewis says.
Rankin, 55, left Balfour Beatty for Lilley in 1988. Sir Lewis was not
prepared to comment on whether Rankin's departure derived from pressure from
Glasgow investment institutions.
Hann, 59, is part-time chairman of Scottish Nuclear, and between 1972-1986
was chief executive of Seaforth Maritime. Sir Lewis describes him as 'a very
distinguished and well-known figure in Scottish industry who happens to have
some spare capacity at the moment'. Hann had been chief executive as well as
chairman of Scottish Nuclear between July 1991 and April of this year.

FT  06 OCT 92 / People: Sykes not floored by Mosaic
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mosaic Investments, the West-Midlands-based mini-conglomerate which last
week suspended its shares, has hired Yorkshire entrepreneur Hugh Sykes as
executive chairman.
Greg Hutchings, the chief executive of Tomkins, who owns around 9 per cent
of Mosaic, had been acting chairman after Brian Disbury, the previous
chairman and chief executive, was dismissed in July. Hutchings, who has been
on the board since 1987, remains as a non-executive director.
Sykes, 60, built up high temperature vacuum furnace maker Thermal
Scientific, which he floated on the USM in 1983 at a value of just over
Pounds 3m, to sell it to TI five years later for Pounds 72.5m. He is
chairman of Sheffield Development Corporation, set up in 1988 to regenerate
the Lower Don valley. It is understood Sykes will continue with this
non-executive role, but he was unavailable for comment yesterday.
The shares of Mosaic, which has sold its engineering business, and been
refocusing on marketing services ranging from plastic coat-hangers to
merchandising cartoon characters, were suspended at 60p after the company
failed to agree terms with its bankers for a borrowing facility to redeem
Pounds 2.99m of preference shares from Rodney Day, who sold his design and
marketing company to Mosaic in 1988. Group managing director Leon Angrave
was also not available yesterday. Mosaic said in a statement that Sykes
would conduct 'a thorough examination' of the group, see through the
completion of the budget review, and hold discussions with the company's
bankers 'as soon as possible'.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Bundesbank rules out changes to EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUNDESBANK yesterday ruled out modification of the European Monetary
System despite the recent turmoil in the currency markets.
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the Bundesbank, in a speech due to be
delivered in Gravenbruch, near Frankfurt, argued that the anchor of the EMS
must remain a strong D-Mark, and any attempt to soften the EMS parameters or
to relax the commitment to stability at the heart of the system would be
counter-productive. The text of the speech was released to the press earlier
yesterday.
He added that 'recent events in the EMS have done some good. They have drawn
aside a veil and revealed the realities of the situation.'
Mr Tietmeyer's remarks appeared to be directed at EC members, principally
Britain, who have been calling for reform of the EMS. Although Britain has
been the most direct in its calls for reform, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, under pressure from other EC countries, has indicated that the UK
will delay pressing for EMS changes.
Mr Tietmeyer said industrial countries were suffering the economic
consequences of expansionary monetary policy in the second half of the
1980s. With this in mind, it would be irresponsible for Germany to abandon
its anti-inflation policies now, he argued.
Mr Tietmeyer, who takes over from Mr Helmut Schlesinger as the president of
the German central bank in the summer of next year, rebutted suggestions
that the currency market turbulence was the Bundesbank's fault.
'Some people talk about the collapse of the EMS, and in parts of the foreign
press the blame is laid on 'arrogant' or at least 'egotistical' Germans,' he
said, 'especially on the allegedly one-sided policies of the Bundesbank.'
He argued that the real reason for the turbulence of recent weeks was that
exchange rate structures had become unrealistic because of economic
divergencies. This had been recognised by the serious foreign press, he
said.
The heavy burden of monetary policy in Germany had contributed to the
tensions within the EMS, but the deciding factor was economic misalignment.
It would have been better for the system and its credibility if the rules
permitting realignment had been brought to bear earlier.
He said it would take some time for the emotions stirred up recently to
subside, since the emotional disturbance reflected 'disappointed illusions'.
UK proposes relaunch to save treaty, Page 3
Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday made clear that he sees ratification of the
Maastricht treaty as a vital first step to allow rapid enlargement of the
European Community.
At a meeting of business leaders near Bonn, he denied any intention of
marginalising any member of the EC, rejected the idea of a two-speed or
three-speed Europe, but insisted that the Community could not move at the
pace of its 'slowest ship'.
He insisted that Maastricht provided 'a secure basis for stability of the
future European currency', and opposed dilution of entrance criteria for
economic and monetary union.

<TEXT>
RESCUE WORKERS yesterday held out little hope of finding survivors among
more than 250 people still missing after an El Al cargo aircraft crashed
into two Amsterdam apartment blocks on Sunday.
Eighty flats with 239 registered residents were reduced to smouldering
rubble after the Israeli Boeing 747 ploughed into two connected apartment
buildings shortly after 6.30pm.
'Rough estimates lead us to fear that more than 250 are missing.
Unfortunately, there is little hope that they are still alive,' Mr Ed van
Thijn, the mayor of Amsterdam, told a special meeting of the city council.
The three crew and one woman passenger on board the aircraft also died.
Six bodies have been recovered and seven others located in the debris. The
search is expected to take three to four days because of the perilous
condition of the buildings.
Riot police last night moved into the mainly immigrant suburb where the
aircraft crashed to guard the area against looters.
In Brussels the European Commission said it was granting Ecu1m (Pounds
780,000) in emergency aid to help the families of the victims of the
catastrophe.
A mechanical or structural problem appears to have been the most likely
cause of the crash, although the possibility of sabotage has not been ruled
out.
The Boeing four-engine 747 freighter crashed into two 10-storey blocks of
flats as it tried to return to Schiphol airport outside Amsterdam, 13
minutes after take-off. The aircraft, with a cargo of perfume, electronic
equipment, textiles and machinery and carrying about 70 tonnes of fuel, lost
its two starboard engines soon after take-off when both caught fire.
Dutch civil aviation officials found the engines, which are expected to help
pinpoint the cause of the accident, in a lake about nine miles from the
crash site. A pond is being drained in the search for the aircraft's missing
flight recorder.
Boeing, the airframe manufacturer, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the engine maker,
have sent experts to help Dutch officials and two teams of Israeli
investigators.
The aircraft had a serious wheel fault on take-off several years ago, El Al
said yesterday. Earlier the company had said the aircraft had no record of
trouble.
The engine trouble became apparent when the aircraft was above Almere to the
east of Amsterdam, near Lake Ijssel. The Dutch civil aviation authority said
the decision to return to Schiphol was made by the Israeli captain,
disputing suggestions that the crew could have tried to touch down in the
lake or on farmland.
The civil aviation authority confirmed that the pilot chose to head for
runway 27 - the closest and in his line of vision - instead of runway 6, as
advised by Schiphol. The airport tower's preference would have taken the
aircraft over a less densely-populated area but the captain's choice takes
precedence in emergency landings.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Air France free to buy stake in Sabena
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday cleared Air France, the French state
airline, to take a 37.6 per cent stake in Sabena, its Belgian counterpart,
provided that rival carriers are allowed to compete on certain monopoly or
near-monopoly routes.
The decision ends almost a year of delays for the companies, which announced
they were ready to do a deal last September and signed an accord in April.
It also lets the two airlines forge a cross-border partnership to strengthen
their position in the European and world markets.
Air France said the compromise was 'a balanced agreement'.
The EC's merger control task force agreed terms for approval of the deal
within a month - but that followed many weeks of tough negotiation about the
legal basis for examining the deal and the anti-trust pledges made by the
airlines and their governments.
The pledges include:
One of the two companies will have to withdraw from the Brussels-Nice and
Brussels-Lyons routes to allow at least one rival airline into the market
Rival EC carriers will be allowed to compete with the planned Air
France-Sabena Brussels-to-Paris shuttle service Certain take-off and landing
slots will be kept available for rival airlines at Brussels airport
Air France and Sabena will have to abandon certain flights to Africa, if a
competing airline will take on the routes.
The Commission said it was 'very likely' that rival airlines would take up
the available slots and routes.
The EC has been worried by growing consolidation in the European airline
industry, which risks undermining the Commission's promotion of competition
through 'open skies'.
Last year the Commission told Air France to sell its 35 per cent stake in
the French regional carrier TAT after it took over UTA, the French long-haul
carrier, and Air Inter, the French domestic airline. British Airways agreed
last month to buy a 49 per cent stake in TAT to challenge Air France on its
home ground.
The loss-making Sabena said the Air France deal would help put it back on a
firm financial footing. Air France and its Belgian financial partners have
injected BFr6bn (Pounds 115m) of fresh capital in exchange for the stake.

FT  06 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Eurotunnel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Given a later opening date, lower short-term revenue projections, and the
formal admission that shareholders will almost certainly have to stump up
more money, it is perhaps surprising that Eurotunnel's share price fell by
just 15 per cent yesterday. The most dispiriting feature of the company's
interim report, though, is the continued level of uncertainty. True, the
long-running dispute with TML is no longer the main issue. Differences
between the two sides have narrowed appreciably. If anything, the balance of
advantage has swung Eurotunnel's way.
On the other hand, the company can still provide no assurance as to when the
first dividend will be paid, and there is no new estimate for the peak
financing requirement and when it will be reached.
Market guesses range from Pounds 0.5bn to Pounds 1bn more than existing
funds. What is clear is that the effect of compound interest on borrowings
needed to replace lost cash flow in the early stages will be painful. The
only consolation for original investors is that the project is closer to
completion: as the timing of the first payout recedes they can at least look
forward to utilising their perks.

It was not just sterling which was causing concern in the currency markets
yesterday. The weakest members of the ERM - the punt, peseta and escudo -
required the prop of intervention. Worse still, the French franc weakened
sharply against the D-Mark for the first time since its narrow escape from
the speculators last month.
The immediate cause may be disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut
interest rates on Friday, coupled with expectations that the US Federal
Reserve might ease today, thus weakening the dollar. Yet the punt, peseta
and escudo are increasingly tipped for devaluation against the D-Mark on
calculations of purchasing power parity. The methodology may be open to
question, but renewed focus on such measures underlines how far faith in
monetary union - the glue which held the ERM together  - has dissolved. In
this context, another  1/4 point off the Lombard rate would hardly be the
whole solution.
That said, governments with pretentions towards membership of the ERM core
must now be praying for an unambiguous signal that German rates will fall.
The weak franc shows it takes more than a good inflation record to keep pace
with the D-Mark.

With equity markets falling worldwide, it is hardly surprising that the UK
is suffering too. Disappointment that the Bundesbank did not cut rates on
Friday is depressing Wall Street as well as Europe. And there is an
additional fear in the US that interest rate cuts alone may not be enough to
get the economy moving. Strong deflationary forces are clearly still at work
everywhere.
But London's 103-point fall also reflects the nerve-wracking vacuum in
economic policy. With over Pounds 40bn of gilts to sell next year, the
government needs the help of foreign investors. They might be reassured by a
strong fiscal stance which underpinned the gilt market and, by keeping gilt
yields down, also helped support equities. However, the government is poorly
placed to give such a lead. Lower spending means either a bruising public
sector pay round or the axing of large and politically sensitive capital
spending programmes. And Mr Major would hardly have the gall to put up
income tax after the election campaign.
Gilt yields thus appear heading back towards 10 per cent, putting further
pressure on equities. And despite devaluation, it is difficult to see where
strong economic growth will come from. Consumer sectors are constrained by
high interest rates, and any spurt in consumer spending would see the
balance of payments deteriorate quickly. Weak markets abroad mean exporters
will have to take market share from others to boost sales. The inflation
position is worsening. When sterling was at DM2.50, retail price rises might
have been expected to reach 4.5 per cent next year. A further 10 per cent
devaluation from that point could see inflation close to 6 per cent
notwithstanding the slack in the domestic economy. The equity market needs
better news from overseas before it can discount a UK recovery.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Observer: Kohler leaves Kohl
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Embattled Chancellor Helmut Kohl is set to lose another of his closest
advisers to the private sector.
Horst Kohler, state secretary in the Finance Ministry and Kohl's chief
negotiator for everything from European monetary union to the international
aid programme for Russia, is planning to quit next year to become president
of Germany's association of savings banks.
It seems an extraordinary transformation for a man who has been so close to
the inner wheels of power and who is still only 49. Yet his closest friends
and associates insist that his decision is being taken for entirely personal
reasons.
Kohler is notorious for driving himself beyond the limits of reasonable hard
work, turning in regular 16-hour days at the Finance Ministry in Bonn when
he is not on the road to international meetings.
He is one of that inner school of German bureaucrats who has acute political
antennae, and occupies the grey area between pure civil service and pure
politics. He also combines a clear intellect with a rapid grasp of issues,
and a readiness to react emotionally as well - a combination which has
endeared him to the chancellor.
Since the departure of Horst Teltschik as Kohl's foreign policy adviser,
also to the private sector, Kohler has been an ever-more important confidant
of the chancellor.
He was the key German negotiator on the economic and monetary aspects of the
Maastricht treaty - and its advocate to an increasingly sceptical German
public - alongside Hans Tietmeyer, his predecessor, who is now at the
Bundesbank.
One of the ironies of the appointment is that the present savings banks'
boss, Helmut Geiger, has always been notably sceptical about the advantages
of the Maastricht treaty for Germany. To that extent, Kohl will now have a
crucial ally in the private sector. But he will have lost someone from the
Bonn inner circle he can ill afford to see go.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, As both a citizen and a member of a reputable German company, I would
like you to know that the majority of Germans were left speechless by the
intention of the German aerospace industry federation to commemorate the
50th anniversary of the first V2 rocket launching from Peenemunde.
In my own way, I have sought to remind senior executives and appropriate
authorities how totally wrong, even abominable, such a commemoration must be
both to Germans and British citizens, who after all have set out to once and
for all create a genuine spirit of a united Europe.
Yet, you are probably aware that many Germans are under the impression that
many British citizens have become suspicious and have deve-loped rather
reserved opinions about the Germans following the reunification of this
country.
It was by no means wise for Britain to erect a monument to Sir Arthur
Harris, who was responsible for the bombing of Dresden in February 1945.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Suburban bell-wether rings political change: Floating voters
in a pivotal blue-collar area near Detroit are abandoning George Bush this
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a balmy afternoon in Detroit, Michigan, just a month before the US
presidential election. In the parking lot of the suburban Eastgate shopping
mall Mr Sante Cervini, a local resident, is pouring scorn on Republican
President George Bush.
'Would you want another 12 years of disaster?' the retired auto company
technician asks. 'I don't know Bill Clinton, but the young man can't do
worse than this lot.'
Mr Cervini is just one of 250m Americans, but he belongs to a group with
great political significance - he is a floating voter in Macomb County, a
swathe of suburbia to the north of Detroit which has become a political
bellwether. Mr Cervini voted for the Republican Ronald Reagan in the 1980
and 1984 elections and Mr Bush in 1988. But this time he is backing the
Democrats and Mr Clinton.
Opinion polls and random interviews in shopping malls indicate that many
residents of Macomb are thinking like Mr Cervini. The bell-wether, in short,
may be sounding Mr Bush's political demise.
That said, the electorate has been volatile this year and much could change
between now and November 3. The populist Mr Ross Perot is back in the race,
and there are three presidential candidates' television debates to be held.
Yet in Macomb, voting intentions seem to have been firming up over the past
few weeks and may now be hard to shift.
The county's importance is twofold. First, it usually reflects the voting
patterns of Michigan - one of several mid-western industrial states which
are expected to prove the most crucial battlefield of this year's campaign.
It is no coincidence that Mr Bush and Mr Clinton have each visited the state
eight times already.
Second, Macomb is prime habitat for one of the most closely observed of
American political species, the so-called 'Reagan Democrats'. The phrase
describes those blue-collar and lower-middle-class white voters from
traditional Democrat families who began deserting to Republican presidential
candidates in the 1970s - around the time many were also moving up in the
world, from homes in the inner cities to more affluent suburbs.
America's white suburbs - those leafy havens of neat lawns, Neighbourhood
Watch and Little League baseball - are increasingly important in
presidential campaigns. Between 1968 and 1988 the percentage of the ballot
cast in such areas grew from 35.6 per cent to 48.3 per cent.
In the 1980s, the stream of defections from the Democratic party and its
liberal candidates turned into a flood - hence the phrase 'Reagan
Democrats'. Confusingly, however, the breed has generally remained loyal to
the Democratic party in local, state and US congressional elections.
Macomb County, which began to be seen as a bellwether in the 1980s, mirrors
these trends. While the Democratic party still dominates local politics, its
presidential candidate has not carried the area since Hubert Humphrey in
1968. In 1960 Macomb gave one of the strongest suburban margins in the
nation to Mr John Kennedy but in 1988 it cast 65 per cent of its vote for Mr
Bush.
So what makes the Macomb voter tick? The county's inhabitants are
overwhelmingly white (97 per cent), of modest means (average family income
Dollars 40,000), of mixed European background and very conservative. Their
overriding concerns have long been crime, jobs and property taxes.
Two other factors have shaped the area's politics. One is its high
dependence, in common with the rest of Detroit, on the Big Three automobile
companies, which have their headquarters in the city. Many residents are
members of the United Auto Workers union.
The other factor is its proximity to the crime-ridden black ghettoes of
Detroit's inner city.
So concerned was the Democratic party by the erosion of its base here in the
mid-1980s that it commissioned a now- celebrated study which found Macomb
inhabitants were virulently anti-black, and tended to view the progressive,
pro-minority policies of the Democratic party as a betrayal of its
blue-collar white members. It was against this background - and economic
expansion - that Mr Reagan and Mr Bush won votes in the area. Mr Reagan, in
particular, was seen as a charismatic leader of modest origins who did not
pander to minority groups.
Law and order and 'welfare scroungers' - a code-word by suburban whites for
unemployed blacks - are still emotive issues in Macomb. But this year they
have been eclipsed by the poor state of the US economy. 'People get
politically excited on two issues - when you mess with their kids and their
pocketbooks - and this is a pocketbook election,' says Mr Leo Lalonde,
chairman of the Macomb County Democratic party.
Detroit has particular reason for anxiety. Recession has hurt the auto
industry badly and General Motors, the biggest of the Big Three, is in the
throes of a huge factory closure programme. Macomb has not been hit directly
by this, but the impending demise of a plant west of Detroit has made the
community edgy.
These fears have been intensified by the free trade agreement with Mexico
and Canada which President Bush negotiated last summer. The UAW claims this
will encourage an exodus of motor industry jobs south of the border. Mr
Clinton has now endorsed the pact, albeit with significant qualifications,
which is bound to disappoint some Macomb voters.
While Mr Bush's main difficulty in Macomb is the state of the economy, he
also has an image problem. At a time of hardship, his patrician background
jars with many constituents, some of whom also criticise him for policy
U-turns.
'Bush just doesn't seem to be focused,' says 71-year-old Mrs Babetta Becker,
a lifelong Republican who will vote for Clinton. 'I don't like him,' she
says of the Democrat, 'but we need a change.'
Mr Clinton, then, seems to be picking up many floating voters in Macomb
because he is not Mr Bush, rather than for any positive qualities of his
own. It was Mr Perot who very successfully played the not-Bush role in the
early summer, before he quit the presidential race. But having re-entered
the contest last week, he now seems to have lost a lot of his credibility.
'He's just a hot flash,' says Mr Cervini.
The election may yet prove close, but one recent poll (taken before Mr
Perot's re-entry) put Mr Clinton a solid 12 points ahead in Michigan as a
whole, while a Democratic survey in Macomb put him 15 points in front there.
Whatever the result, many Reagan Democrats in Macomb are preparing to vote
for Mr Clinton. But this does not necessarily mean they are coming home to
the party for good, or that the political pendulum has begun a
once-a-generation swing back to the left.
'The floating voters will stay floating voters,' says Mr Carl Marlinga,
Macomb's prosecuting attorney, an elected Democrat. 'Reagan made them
independent and I don't think Clinton will bring them back - unless he has a
very good four years as president.'

<TEXT>
Sir, Marjorie Shaffer's article about the pharmaceutical industry turning to
nature as a source of new drugs (Technology, September 29) made no mention
of the World Health Organisation also running a project on the study of
non-western healing methods - a study inspired by the third world itself.
Last year on vacation in Bhutan I visited a hospital co-sponsored by the WHO
and by an Italian charitable organisation - a small international research
team headed by an Italian doctor. It certainly is not amazing that this
country was selected for such a scheme. Bhutan used to be called 'the
country of the medicinal herbs'.
A native pharmaceutical chemist told us that there were over 100 Bhutanese
herbs to be studied. In this small country three traditional Asiatic healing
methods are further practised: Chinese, Indian and Tibetan medicine.
Who will be the first to imitate Lisa Conte's Californian example and try to
commercialise the Bhutanese findings?

Sir, Free to do what? All those who are rejoicing at our new-found 'freedom'
to set our own economic policies appear to suffer from a serious loss of
memory. Some among them may, like me, be old enough to have travelled on the
continent in the late 1950s. They may remember how prosperous this country
seemed compared with France, Germany or northern Italy. Today it is Britain
which is the poor neighbour, in spite of the huge windfall of North Sea oil.
The social services are incomparably better in most members of the EC than
they are here; in the core group, the roads are better as are the railways;
industry is much more productive.
Between 1960 (a reasonable starting point since by then the physical damage
suffered during the second world war had been largely repaired) and 1990 -
that is before we entered the ERM - the pound lost nearly 90 per cent of its
internal purchasing value.
We were free then. Will we use our new freedom to repeat our economic
performance during the last 30 years over the coming 30?

FT  06 OCT 92 / Letter: Major must break pattern of delay and clarify
objective
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD JEFFREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Unfortunately, the short history of Mr Major's occupancy of Number 10
and his earlier period in Number 11 show one common theme: delay. From the
start, there was a failure to recognise the immense damage that 15 per cent
base rates were doing to the economy and, in particular, to consumer and
industrial confidence.
As a result, the easing in monetary policy was too little and too late. And,
in the current situation, once again there has been the failure to seize the
opportunity created. Once the UK had pulled out of the exchange rate
mechanism, interest rates should have been reduced far more quickly.
The opportunity was there. Unfortunately, by delaying the decision, the
government has all but lost the chance.
Meanwhile, the talk is of tightening up fiscal policy. Here again there
seems to be confusion. Forgiving Mr Major for some pre-election slippage,
the main problems with government finances are the problems of recession -
slow growing tax receipts and fast rising benefit payments.
To suggest that the cure for the yawning public sector borrowing requirement
will be found in cracking down on public sector current spending or even in
raising taxes seems to be missing the point. Rather than helping solve the
problem, both measures could help prolong the recession and thereby
exacerbate the mismatch between government expenditure and revenue.
So what is the solution to the current dilemma? First, it must be emphasised
that the confidence of the markets will not be gained until government
policy is seen to have a clear objective. That objective must be to
re-establish growth in the economy. Anything else must be treated as a
sideshow for the present - even inflation which, all the evidence suggests,
is negligible in the private sector.
Second, the Treasury must rid itself of its fixation with the currency.
Whether it likes it or not, history shows that it is virtually impossible
for our monetary authorities to control movements in the exchange rate.
It also shows that when policy is so focused, it is the real economy that
suffers (we only have to look at the experience since the 1987 general
election to confirm this).
So the solution? The government must act now to reduce interest rates. Not
only will this help restore confidence in the economy, it will also impress
on the markets that the authorities will not be held to a growth ransom by
the currency.
Ironically, the long-term impact of rate cuts might even help the government
to achieve some of its other objectives: faster economic growth would help
close the public sector budget deficit and would also be reflected in
substantial productivity gains which would help hold down inflation. And, in
the end, by making the UK economy a more viable longer-term investment
prospect, lower interest rates might actually help stimulate inflows of
investment capital, helping to bolster the pound.
Certainly, with the pound collapsing in anticipation of an easing in policy,
it seems a nonsense to delay a rate cut on the argument that it would
unsettle the currency markets.
The prime minister has created the opportunity; he must now use it, even if
it requires a sacrifice of sterling near term.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Letter: UK government sensible to change means to achieve
objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK EVERSHED
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I do not agree with your editorial ('Mr Major must choose', October 1).
The government's economic policy has not collapsed. It is intact and working
significantly better than before.
Your editorial has confused ends and means. The government's policy has not
changed, but the way it is setting out to achieve that policy has changed.
Its policy is to increase the rate of economic growth in the UK in order to
improve the welfare of the population. In order to achieve this objective it
has been bringing down the rate of inflation. This needs to be done because
economic growth can only be sustained if the return on capital employed is
high in relation to interest rates.
Nominal interest rates can only be kept down for a sustained period of time
in an economy which has a low rate of inflation. The government thought
Britain had a better chance of maintaining a low rate of inflation if the
country were inside the ERM. Our membership of the ERM was therefore a means
to an end, and not an end in itself.
As things turned out, our membership of the ERM led to higher interest
rates, a depressed economy, collapsing profit margins and, as a consequence,
a poor return on capital employed. The object of the exercise, a higher rate
of investment and a faster rate of economic growth, was not being achieved.
When a government finds that its means are not enabling it to achieve its
objectives it is eminently sensible for it to change the means.
Fortunately, the chancellor, Norman Lamont, discovered in the nick of time
that it was necessary to change course rapidly in order for the government
to be able to achieve its policy ends. He deserves our support for his bold
move.
Some commentators, however, have suggested that a falling currency leads to
a higher rate of inflation. This is not so. The rate of money growth
determines the rate of inflation. Here the government has an exemplary
record. There is, therefore, no need to be worried about inflation. It will
continue to fall, interest rates will also continue to fall, the return on
capital in relation to interest rates will come right, and our rate of
economic growth and the welfare of the nation will improve substantially in
the medium term.
Norman Lamont is the best man for the job.

How do you motivate people doing dirty jobs in anti-social hours? That,

His particular problem was the council's 'sex department', part of the
section which licenses sex shops and places of entertainment. Its intrepid
squad travels round Soho 'deliberately sampling what is on offer so they can
give evidence in court', according to Montacute.
Since New Zealand is at the forefront of introducing private sector

Picture the scene. A party of wealthy corporate sponsors was invited to pop

But the event lost some of its spontaneity when the orchestra, rehearsing
Porgy and Bess, downed tools.
An official plays down the incident saying it was all a misunderstanding.
The visit had been cleared with the orchestra representative so long ago
that 'it had slipped a few minds'. After the 'temporary communications blip'
had been sorted out the rehearsal went ahead.
However, at least one hard-nosed City type present was unimpressed and says
that the event is yet another sign that the Opera House 'has failed to come
to terms with basic management issues and is squandering its money'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S economic policy establishment, like its economy, is paralysed. But
the longer the paralysis continues, the deeper will be the damage from the
debacle of recent weeks. The government needs a new medium-term framework
for policy and an institutional structure to implement it. Only then can it
hope to bring real order into sterling's position in the foreign exchanges.
It was always inevitable that sterling would fall further against its
European partner currencies than justified by economic fundamentals.
Sterling's fall since the UK left the ERM has, in fact, so far been well
short of a disaster: 14 per cent against the D-Mark but only 11 per cent
using a trade-weighted basket of currencies including the yen and the
dollar. Against the dollar, this represents a return to normality after the
heady heights to which sterling was previously dragged by the D-Mark's
appreciation. The inflation risk from such a devaluation is contained by the
economy's deeply depressed state.
Yet the government cannot afford to allow sterling to go on falling if it
wishes to avoid stoking up serious inflationary problems. The most obvious
course of action in these circumstances - to raise interest rates - would
almost certainly be counter-productive. Given the depth of the recession,
double-digit UK interest rates are not credible because the markets know
that the government cannot sustain them.
Siren voices
What the markets need is reassurance that Mr Major is not going to bow to
the siren voices, both within and outside his party, and cut interest rates
too hard too fast. Large cuts in UK interest rates now are the best way to
ensure that this latest devaluation, like all the others of recent decades,
leads to consumption and inflation rather than investment and growth.
A prudent short-term monetary policy would imply falls in interest rates
over the next year, but only once the markets are calmer. The experience of
the US, Australia and other debt-burdened economies is that cuts in
short-term interest rates combined with substantial currency depreciations
can be accommodated without generating inflation. But no one knows how much
UK policy has been eased by the fall in sterling of the past few weeks. And
the UK's inflationary psychology means that a softly softly approach on
interest rates is all the government can afford to pursue if the gains to
competitiveness of the past weeks are to be retained.
Policy gap
While the government remains silent, and the markets nervous and jumpy, the
risk of a further collapse will remain. The task facing the government is to
calm the situation. This cannot be achieved by party conference speeches; it
requires the policy gap to be filled.
It is very difficult to see how Mr Norman Lamont can assist his prime
minister in addressing this enormous credibility problem. Mr Lamont's
difficulty is not that anything he says is by definition incredible. In
fact, the opposite is true. The longer he stays in office and is seen by
some to be dangling the prospect of rapid interest rate cuts to
Euro-sceptical Tories, the more the markets will lean on the pound. The
words Mr Lamont needs to use to bolster his political position in Brighton
this week are precisely those which will do most damage in the markets.
Much more important than any changes in Treasury personnel, however, is the
removal of the power to make monetary policy from Treasury hands. Promises
to fight inflation or to monitor an unspecified range of economic
indicators, whatever they may be, will continue to ring hollow when uttered
by British politicians of any party, whether counselled by the current or
any other cohort of Treasury advisers.
The government needs a new division of economic labour. An independent Bank
of England is no panacea. But it would be a step towards monetary policy
credibility, if suitably constituted. Taking the power to set interest rates
out of political hands is also a precondition of a successful re-entry of
sterling into the ERM.
Only then would the Treasury be free to cut public spending and/or raise
taxes and so maximise the chances of an investment-led recovery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF BRITAIN'S increasingly substantial devaluation is to work, it needs more
than the support of appropriate fiscal and monetary policies from the
government. Industrialists have to seize the new opportunity for export-led
growth. Yet the first tangible signs of confident activity in industry after
Britain's departure from the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) appear to be
coming not so much from the tradeable goods sector, conventionally defined,
as from the market in corporate control - witness yesterday's cash offer by
Hanson for food group RHM and the earlier unsolicited tender offer from
Hongkong Land for a minority stake in Trafalgar House.
It would be foolish to draw too many conclusions in the aftermath of the ERM
disaster from one hostile bid and another partial offer. The most striking
features that the two besieged companies have in common are anyway
independent of external circumstances - namely, unexciting management and
disillusioned shareholders. That said, British assets now look cheap even to
a bidder from Hong Kong, whose currency is pegged to a sagging dollar, and
Hongkong Land decided to make its tender offer before yesterday's
spectacular stock market collapse. Moreover, Britain remains one of the few
economies in the world where the right to manage companies is up for sale at
all times.
Opposite risks
Against that background it would be surprising if local predators with cash
on the balance sheet were not the first to scent that the time was ripe to
give their acquisitive instincts free rein. There is, in addition, a risk
that the return on cash will fall and equity prices rise if the government
heeds calls to go for broke by reducing interest rates sharply.
But there remains an equal and opposite risk - as Hanson knows from its
acquisition of assets in the construction and house-building group Beazer
last year - that a decision to go for a given target may not be validated by
the timing and shape of a subsequent economic recovery. With hindsight,
BTR's bid for Hawker Siddeley looks better attuned to an economy whose best
hope now lies with export-led growth.
Yet the risks look greater for Hongkong Land's investment in Trafalgar than
in Hanson's bid for RHM. Trafalgar, with a portfolio of business almost
uniquely ill-suited to the depredations of the present recession  -
property, house-building, construction, cruise liners, hotels and
engineering - would be a handful for any management. The businesses may have
impressive names, such as Ritz, Cunard and John Brown, but the valuation of
the assets presents huge difficulties in the present climate, especially in
property. Further doubt is cast on the quality of assets and earnings by
criticism from the Financial Reporting Review Panel. Those who long
suspected that Trafalgar's way with accounting was idiosyncratic have been
applauding the new accountancy watchdog from a safe distance.
A solid business
In contrast, RHM is the custodian of excellent brand names and solid, if
unexciting, businesses. Having attracted the predatory attentions of Goldman
Fielder Wattie and Sir James Goldsmith at the end of the great 1980s
takeover boom, it is an old bid chestnut whose share price languishes way
below its level when last under attack. In short it has all the lacklustre
but cash-generative characteristics that Hanson has looked for in its past
acquisitions. And the bid, which Hanson has toyed with on more than one
previous occasion, comes when analysts suspect that conditions in the
milling industry are just about to take a turn for the better.
What Hongkong Land might bring to Trafalgar House is an open question. It
would look an unlikely manager for the businesses of John Brown, Davy or
Cunard. As for Hanson, it could reasonably claim to bring useful financial
muscle to RHM, but on the basis of its recent record, not much more. What
evidence there is suggests that takeovers produce fewer, if any, efficiency
gains than their proponents loudly proclaim. Sterling's devaluation will
have to be followed by something more substantial than a flurry of bids and
deals if anything much is to come of it.

FT  06 OCT 92 / 'The economy, stupid'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain seems set for a return to its customary grade B level of peacetime
government, since the chances are that Mr John Major's administration will
make a recovery of sorts. We can therefore look forward to the prime
minister sitting in Number 10 Downing Street, the puppet of events, taking
what comes as he serves out the five-year term of office to which the
Conservatives were elected in April.
This is not an especially gloomy view. Mr Major displayed grade A toughness
during the Gulf war, the Maastricht negotiations and the election campaign.
He still has it in him to resume the role of a popular prime minister,
possibly by design, but perhaps by accident. The government's management of
the economy is so fumble-fingered that it might inadvertently ignite the
spark that leads to an explosive boom and dishes Labour for a fifth time.
That would turn Lady Thatcher's successor into a second Tory hero. The
unfortunate little difficulties of September and October 1992 would be
forgotten. We could worry about the consequent recession some years later.
Any prognostication, even the conventional one outlined above, is risky when
what is actually taking place in the world of politics is so far outside the
range of a decent fiction writer's invention. When a chancellor can stay in
office after changing interest rates three times in a day and then insulting
the president of the Bundesbank while trying to apologise to him, anything
can happen. Mr Major could be turfed out quite suddenly, perhaps as a
knock-on consequence of an eruption of ill-feeling at this week's
Conservative conference in Brighton, or possibly at the hands of the
backbenchers' 1922 committee, or maybe following a shamingly large rebels'
vote (if there is one) when he brings the bill to ratify the Maastricht
treaty back before the House of Commons.
The odds are, however, against any such nightmare coming true. The ability
of Tory managers to anaesthetise those who show the slightest sign of revolt
is well-known. There will be bile at this conference, to be sure - but will
there be arsenic? Again, when parliament resumes, backbenchers will not want
to barrack a prime minister who led their party to victory against such
seemingly high odds so short a while ago, especially when they know they are
unlikely to unite behind any conceivable successor. They might get Mr
Michael Heseltine, or Mr Kenneth Clarke. Both are more solidly pro-Europe
than Mr Major. The Maastricht vote is hard to call, but it would be in
character for most of the so-called rebels to come to heel and march through
the 'yes' lobby on the whips' orders. If not, a quick vote of confidence
could set the government on its feet again.
I would be more certain of this line of argument, so reassuring for those
who want to stay in office, were it not for the absence of an economic
policy. Getting one in place must now be the priority. As the Clinton
managers have it, on a poster on their office wall, the answer to all
questions about what is important in the US election campaign is 'the
economy, stupid'. The same applies to Mr Major's resurrection campaign.
True, he did himself some good last Thursday. He intimated that he will face
out the rebels within his party and fight to get the Maastricht bill
through. He thus began to pick up the pieces of his policy for Europe.
Sadly, that display of political courage had nothing to tell us about 'the
economy, stupid'. By yesterday the hopes of last week had been submerged by
the sinking pound.
This has been accompanied by a sinking feeling in the markets, and the
country at large - a perception that the government does not know which
economic policy to adopt and, worse, that when it does make up its mind it
may be as wrong as ever. Should interest rates be slashed, or kept close to
9 per cent in what would probably be a vain attempt to prevent further
devaluation? Would it make any difference, either way? Will public spending
be controlled, or taxes increased, or neither, or both? What difference will
any of these moves make to the growth rate? As always, economists differ on
these points. It is the government's job to hire the best economists and
look to their advice. The verdict of public opinion is that it is not doing
either part of that job.
Mr Major has evidently been more concerned to protect himself from the
political dangers inherent in reshuffling his chancellor than he is to
restore confidence in the government's management of the economy. Anyway, it
is not possible to place much faith in the promise of any particular
minister. The prime minister's simple pronouncement that bearing down on
inflation is still the government's policy is meaningless. It does not in
itself answer any of the questions listed above. He, or his chancellor, must
do better. For it is hard to recall a time when, according to what people
are saying about it, the public has had less confidence in the government
than it does today.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Tippett and Strauss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard Strauss was 77 when he composed Capriccio, his last opera, and there
was only a little 'late Strauss' still to come - notably, of course, the
Four Last Songs. When Sir Michael Tippett wrote his Triple Concerto more
than a dozen years ago he was 74, but even now there seems to be no swansong
in the offing. Piece after piece comes from him still, often vigorous and
always idiosyncratic.
The Triple Concerto, which Andre Previn conducted with the London Symphony
at the Barbican on Sunday, is among the most splendid of his late works. The
orchestral invention is rich and telling, the solo roles - for violin, viola
and cello - dramatically contrasted and eloquent. Evidently those roles are
full of rewards; they seem to inspire the players who take them up.
Here they were the orchestra's leader, Alexander Barantschik, and its
(co-)principal viola and cello, Edward Vanderspar and Moray Welsh. In that
sense, they are an experienced trio. Their dialogues sang with arching
passion, not forgetting Tippett's characteristic flicks of mischief.
Previn's gift for achieving a lucid balance in the tricky Barbican acoustic
was well-found: the orchestra never sounded throttled, but every solo line
came through intact.
This entirely gripping performance followed a tamer one of Mozart's Symphony
no. 39 (gracious and sensible, untouched by recent experiments in lighter,
leaner 'period' style), and was itself followed by Capriccio excerpts: the
'moonlight' interlude, and Kiri te Kanawa in the Countess's closing
monologue. The interlude began grumpily, with a first horn who seemed to
have left his legato at home somewhere, and the music failed to make its
best silvery effect.
Dame Kiri's soprano was silvery enough, and lovely. Impossible not to
surrender to it, in this ravishing Straussery; impossible also, though, not
to regret the words, which were all but lost. This is one of Strauss's most
inspired operatic monologues, and its shape - its calculated dramatic form -
needs more pointed attention to verbal sense than Dame Kiri cared to give
it.
It was naughty of the programme-book to suppress the major-domo's closing
line, even if it wasn't to be sung here. As the Countess's last rhetorical
question hangs in the air - 'Is there no ending to this opera that wouldn't
be trivial?' - he announces: 'Countess, supper is served.'

FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Montreux-Vevey Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Have the organisers of the Montreux-Vevey Festival suddenly become aware
that if they do not hurry, the 20th century will be over? After 47 years of
existence the festival has acquired an image more solid than adventurous. It
is stuffed with the names of well-known soloists and conductors likely to
attract wealthy residents of that lotus-land and visitors who can afford the
big hotels.
However, this year most of the works came from the first half of this
century, with a weekend of chamber music stretching as far as Stockhausen,
Glass and Adams, also a new work commissioned in memory of Messiaen. The
Franco-Swiss Honegger apart (this is his centenary year) native composers
were hard to find. When it comes to outward-aimed cultural relations the
Swiss appear to treat their own music as a more or less guilty secret, to be
kept hidden from prying ears.
The festival's final week brought an opportunity to visit one of
Switzerland's shrines of culture. The Theatre du Jorat in the village of
Mezieres near Lausanne has been described before on this page. This great
barn, in its conversion an ancestor of the Maltings at Snape, was
transformed early this century by the writer Rene Morax into a simple, roomy
theatre with about 1,000 places, principally intended for drama but
adaptable for concerts and occasional opera. Honegger's King David had its
first performance there in 1921. The place is bare, but like most wooden
buildings, friendly. On this evening it housed the Lausanne Chamber
Orchestra under Emmanuel Joel, with Jean-Francois Antonioli as solo pianist.
There were two works by Honegger, the concertino for piano and the second
symphony (strings and trumpet). The concertino is an agreeable lightweight,
somewhere between neo-classical Stravinsky and Ravel in his jazz mood. The
first two movements of the second symphony with their soberly expressed
grief suited the surroundings perfectly - as in the Maltings, strings sound
beautifully natural. The busy finale, culminating navely but effectively in
a chorale pealing out on the trumpet, can hardly fail to work. The soloist,
Gerard Metrailler, also played Jolivet's first trumpet concerto (with piano
obbligato), a Conservatoire test piece whose lumpy textures I find
disagreeable.
Earlier we heard the six 'little symphonies' of the year's other
centenarian, Milhaud; pungent miniatures written over a period of six years
from 1917. They were not intended for performance together: each 'symphony'
uses a different chamber combination of strings and wind with, in the sixth,
a vocal quartet. Thumbnail capriccios, by no means as casual as they seem at
first, playing with styles as far apart as Brazil and Vienna, ranging in
mood from blue melancholy to piquant mordancy, turning everything to
personal use. This is the kind of experience one hopes for at a festival.
There were some empty seats. Perhaps they would have been full if the
organisers had laid on transport - Mezieres is not easily reached from
Montreux and presumably even in this prosperous region not every music-lover
has a car. Democracy is a house with many mansions but even so, for a
village enterprise intended above all to be 'popular', it is surprising to
have top seat prices at about Pounds 37 (SFr80) - in a Spartan, unheated
building with bare benches.
Montreux itself has been forced to make do with a provisional concert hall
in the Congress Centre by the lake - a large, rectangular, low-ceilinged,
one-level chamber which inflates and muddles orchestral sound. This was
deafeningly demonstrated by the Suisse Romande Orchestra's concert under the
regular conductor, Armin Jordan. In more senses than one a smashing
programme - Roussel's third symphony, Ravel's left-hand piano concerto with
Leon Fleisher as a commanding soloist, Janacek's sinfonietta - it could have
been designed to show off the hall's bad points. And this was the same
orchestra and conductor who made such sweet sounds for Louise in Geneva a
few nights previously. Fortunately, the new Auditorium Stravinsky (the
composer lived nearby for some years) is rising on an adjacent site and will
soon be ready.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Boardroom Shuffle - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Warrick's Boardroom Shuffle begins with wine for the audience
but fails to maintain this level of entertainment.
The directors of the multi-billion ecu Satellite Energy Transfer Technology
company are all set to cheerlead their shareholders and the press through a
glossy annual general meeting when the company's head announces his
resignation. Peter Blake (Jeremy Spriggs), has begun to believe in his
corporate image - a nauseating creation of the company as family. He invites
four candidates for the top job to take their pants down in public as part
of a contest which appears to be based on Endurance, the Japanese game show
of Clive James fame.
The disintegration which follows is a provocative exploration of loyalty,
treachery and ambition. Everyone, except the mysterious supercomputer,
unveiled at the AGM, has at least one hidden shame and most have betrayed
someone.
The imaginatively chosen set, the yawning, glazed atrium of the Cotton's
Centre in London's Tooley Street, is a challenge for the cast. The
production opens with the members of the American Connexion theatre company,
self-consciously in character, milling around making mad small talk with
those who arrive early.
It is a nice device and might have worked had the actors not been foiled by
genuine city slickers passing by from nearby offices and stomping implacably
through the props, looking much the madder of the groups.
Gregg Ward's strong script is let down by some of the performances. However,
Jeremy Spriggs is competent as the messianic inventor (to underline that
point, he enters riding on a bicycle to the strains of the corporate hymn).
Martin Chadwick (Keith Bayliss), the finance director, is all paternal
complacency. It is his deeply antipathetic character, supported by greasy
hair and square spectacles, which best expresses the potential tensions
between the idea of loyalty to corporate profits and loyalty to life.
Paula Mitchell (Meera Devon), as head of communications, captures something
of the modern press officer. Parroting the weird patois of corporate
literature, she knows how to smile with just the right degree of
insincerity. She is amusing as the patient peon whose work is undermined by
the stupidity of her boss.
The pace of the production is patchy. There are compelling moments. One
contestant for the top job is forced to reveal a personality disorder for
which she was institutionalised. But the atmosphere moves through pathos to
bathos as she discloses it was an addiction to sex. However, the production
is slow to start and sags worryingly in the middle.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: Espana - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Queen Elizabeth Hall last week the BBC mounted 'Espana', a pair of
concerts to mark the Columbus anniversary, both of them broadcast on Radio
3. Every schoolchild may know that this is the most specious of all
historical celebrations, but it provided an excellent excuse for such a
panoramic survey of Spanish music.
The BBC's new controller of music, Nicholas Kenyon, had given his personal
imprimatur to these bumper, triple-decked concerts. The juxtaposition of the
familiar and the arcane seemed a conscious evocation of the Radio 3
invitation concerts of blessed memory, but the user-friendly introductions -
discursive scripts delivered to the audience in the hall and radio listeners
alike - revealed the new, caring face of the network: Glockian iconoclasm
replaced by slick, Kenyon-style packaging.
Mainstream Spanish music was included - the Matrix Ensemble under Robert
Ziegler gave a robust, warmly expressive concert performance of Falla's El
Retablo de Maese Pedro with Adrian Thompson, Matthew Best and the splendid
treble Sam Pay, while Rafael Orozco played four pieces from Albeniz's Iberia
 -but the real fascination of the programmes came from the ancient and
modern elements.
On Tuesday ancient Spain was represented by a selection from the wonderfully
energetic and inventive Cantigas de Santa Maria, a 13th-century collection
of troubadour songs, sung with great pungency by the Dufay Collective.
Friday's concert was opened by the New London Consort directed by Philip
Pickett with the renaissance Cancionero de la Columbina, a songbook almost
exactly contemporary with Columbus's voyage.
Contemporary Spain produced the British premiere of Alegrias by the
Andalucian Manuel Hidalgo, former pupil of Helmut Lachenmann and now
resident in Stuttgart. It was a valuable introduction to a composer scarcely
known in Britain, with an evident gift for arresting textural ideas and a
tendency towards music that is mysteriously allusive and artfully intent on
obscuring any subtexts.
This being a BBC promotion, there was Roberto Gerhard on both evenings too.
On Tuesday the Matrix Ensemble had given a sparkling account of Leo, one of
the most enduring and directly expressive of his late ensemble works, and
Friday's concert revived Gerhard's third symphony, Collages, excellently
performed by the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Andrew Davis.
The symphony, completed in 1960, is not the most convincing of Gerhard's
major orchestral scores. There are some striking ideas, vivid concatenations
of instruments with the homespun musique concrete of the pre-recorded tape.
Yet the elements do not cohere; the continuity, the dawn-to-dusk programme,
is unconvincing. Gerhard's music was uneven, splendidly effective at its
best, but his zealous champions continue to overestimate his worth. In the
context of this thoroughly rewarding mini-series, though, his was an
essential voice.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Arts: The art of the big steel block - William Packer on an
American minimalist in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Each autumn lately the Tate has given over the great spaces of the Duveen
sculpture halls, which form the central axis of the gallery, to a single
sculptor. Now the American minimalist, Richard Serra, follows Richard Long
and Anthony Caro as the first foreign artist to be so distinguished. The
sculptors are asked to fit their work to the shape of the halls and even to
embrace them implicitly within the work itself. Serra is the first to take
this brief literally.
He has done so in the simplest and most emphatic way possible, introducing a
monstrous steel block apiece into each of the two principal spaces,
apparently rough and ready from their forging yet sized and placed to mark
precisely the proportions of the place, the distances, gaps and spaces that
together offer the sensation of architecture. And the architecture returns
the compliment, for in the interplay between agent and effect, always the
viewer is brought back to the physical presence, indeed to the palpable,
sheer weight and mass of these simple, extraordinary objects, all 35 and 39
tons of them.
Weight &amp; Measure is best seen with the galleries as empty as possible. There
they sit, each block alone in its discrete, softly echoing, vast space, yet,
through the intervening columns of the central rotunda, each visible to the
other, each balance and counter to the other's physical and visual weight.
At a distance they seem identical, their width exactly continuing the
perspective established through the bases of the central colonnade. Their
essential difference declares itself only on approaching the first, the
nearer block to the entrance hall, which rises to more or less average
shoulder height. On taking a siting through to the other, slowly it begins
to dawn on the visitor that the further block must be in fact higher by
about a head. And what one had thought would be a confirming horizontal
proves to be a subtly rising plane, which takes the eye gently upwards as
the heads of other passing visitors sink slowly beneath it, as they walk
away. The eye runs down the full length of the galleries and rises, as it
were, on stepping stones of our dead selves to higher things.
Serra's drawings, shown at the Serpentine, are similarly quite as much
installation as autonomous statement or object. Large rectangular sheets of
canvas are pinned to the wall to be covered with a dense coat of black
pigment painstakingly laid on with paint-stick. Each of the two side
galleries is thus informed by a low block in the centre of the far wall,
like the ghost of a fireplace, and clearly related to the Tate's two
elements. The smaller central gallery has a long low work that occupies the
common corner and the better part of two walls. The work in the main gallery
consists of two immense sheets, each teased into opposite corners of the
room. All these surfaces are as black and heavy as sin.
The effect is manifestly theatrical, the furnishing and celebration of each
particular space. Such is the purpose of the furniture and proper decoration
of any room, only here so reduced and positive is the exercise, so
undistracted, that we think of nothing else. We see the room exactly as it
is, the more so for being not quite empty. This is not art to take away, to
buy off the wall, for though its principle is infinitely re-adjustable,
elsewhere it would be, in this manifestation at least, meaningless. It is,
as the jargon tells us, site specific.
Of the work at the Tate, Serra says that he wanted 'to make sculpture out of
the entire volume' of the Duveen galleries, 'to make the volume of the space
tangible, so that it is understood immediately, physically, by your body . .
. that the volume, through the placement of two sculptural elements, becomes
manifest in a way that allows you to experience it as a whole'.
It is easy to mock minimalism for being, well, minimal. Any fool, we say,
can put one brick on another, or stick a sheet of metal on its end, and call
it art. Most fools, of course, do no such thing, not caring to take the
trouble. On the other hand, I can only admit that too much of the higher
nonsense is offered by artists and critics in self-justification. Such
blather should be disregarded and we should recognise that the real problem
lies as much in what we persuade ourselves a work of art should be, and what
we expect of it.
For despite the lengths in time and trouble to which a Richard Serra, for
example, will go to forge a massive block of steel, or cover a wall with
black oil paint-stick, the real engagement of the minimalist, as with the
conceptualist to whom he is so closely related, is not with the made,
personal and unique object, but rather with the idea and the effect. The
attention is focused closely upon even a single quality of the experience
that art might offer, to be gleaned from even the barest, most mundane of
objects. How little does the imagination and aesthetic sensibility need to
feed on? Do we need art at all, in the modern conventional sense, when an
ancient, anonymous, purposeless - for all we know - standing stone affords
an experience that is clearly aesthetic and imaginative? The minimalist
artist contrives a situation, a particular sensation, in short a performance
to which we are invited to commit ourselves - and that has always seemed to
me to be an interesting thing to do, and quite legitimate.
Richard Serra: Tate Gallery, Millbank SW1, until January 15. Drawings:
Serpentine Gallery, Kensington Gardens W2, until November 15. Supported
respectively by the Henry Moore Foundation, and by the Stanley Thomas
Johnson Foundation and the Henry Moore Sculpture Trust.

FT  06 OCT 92 / The Week in Luxembourg: Wood-pulp decision torn apart -
European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission's 1984 decision fining 36 wood-pulp producers for
alleged involvement in an illegal price fixing cartel has been heavily
criticised in a preliminary opinion of the European Court of Justice.
The opinion, delivered recently by Advocate-General Darmon, recommends that
the ECJ should annul the bulk of the Commission's December 1984 decision
imposing fines on the companies of between Ecu50,000 and Ecu500,000.
The 'wood-pulp case', which involves a series of 10 appeals brought in 1985
by 26 of the producers involved, is the last outstanding competition case to
be heard by the ECJ. Jurisdiction over competition cases was transferred to
the Court of First Instance in September 1989.
Six of the companies affected were based in Canada, 11 in the US, 12 in
Finland, 11 in Sweden, one in Norway, one in Portugal and one in Spain. The
Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, four Swedish, two Finnish producers and a US
producer were not fined. No Swedish producers appealed.
All but three appellants (Bowater, St Anne and International Pulp Sales)
gave undertakings to the Commission in order to qualify for a 90 per cent
reduction in the fines imposed.
The Commission decision
The Commission's 1984 decision found that the producers had infringed EEC
competition rules in four main ways:
First, almost all the producers had acted in concert on prices for bleached
sulphate wood pulp announced for deliveries to the Community during the
whole or part of 1975 to 1981. The Commission made a similar finding of a
concerted practice on actual transaction prices for the same pulp on five EC
member country markets in the whole or part of 1975, 1976, and 1979 to 1981.
Second, the companies that were members of KEA (the US Webb Pomerene Act
export organisation in whose respect the decision was annulled by the ECJ in
1988) were found to have acted in concert in exchanging individualised data
on prices.
Third, the Commission also found concerted action and individualised data
exchanges, within the framework of the European industry's association
Fides, on prices for deliveries of bleached sulphate hardwood pulp in the EC
from 1973 to 1977.
Fourth, some producers had infringed competition rules by including clauses
prohibiiting export or resale in contracts for the sale of wood pulp to
customers in the EC.
Advocate General's opinion
In his opinion, the Advocate General recommended that the ECJ should allow
the appellants' claims and annul the Commission's decision in respect of the
general concerted practices on announced and transaction prices.
In respect of the Fides concerted practice (involving Swedish producers,
Fincell - the Finnish association, other European producers and St Anne, a
Canadian producer), only St Anne should escape, on procedural grounds, he
said. The fine of Ecu100,000 on Fincell should remain.
He also advised the Court to dismiss appeals in respect of the Commission's
finding on the clauses prohibiting import and export. As a result, the fines
on Canadian Forest Products, MacMillan and Westar should be fixed at
Ecu20,000.
Advocate General Darmon was equally robust in rejecting as inadmissible
claims to annul the undertakings given by all but three producers. His view
was that only unilateral acts of the Commission could be challenged in the
context of competition cases. An undertaking was not a unilateral act.
However, the undertakings remain relevant as a factor affecting the level of
the fines.
But, the most important aspects of the Advocate General's opinion were his
dispassionate condemnation of the Commission's procedural irregularities and
his approach to the economic analysis of a concerted practice.
Procedural irregularities
Procedural irregularities form the main ground for setting aside the
decision in relation to transaction prices. The most blatant irregularity
concerns the failure of the Statement of Objections, setting out the case
against the pulp producers, to refer clearly and precisely to an alleged
concerted practice on transaction, as well as announced prices.
Other infringements of the rights of defence found by the Advocate General
include the Commission's failure to permit comment on new evidence requested
by it after the end of the administrative procedure but used in the
decision.
A refusal to disclose competitors' evidence protected by business secrecy
should either have led to an appropriate non-confidential means of
disclosure or the exclusion of the evidence from the decision.
'The Commission's position in this case irresistibly calls to mind those
plans of prisons on which the warder alone is able to see all the inmates
but they cannot see each other,' he said.
The Commission should also pay the costs of the two groups of accountancy
experts appointed by the ECJ to clarify economic evidential questions and
general pulp market trends. According to the Advocate General, these reports
do not support the Commission's decision on its procedural indiscretions.
Concerted practices
The Advocate General proposed the following definition of concerted
practice: 'reciprocation of communications between competitors with the aim
of giving each other assurances as to their conduct on the market'.
Each company is entitled to align itself independently on the conduct of its
competitors, if knowledge of such conduct is obtained solely by monitoring
the market. Parallel conduct cannot be equated with a concerted practice but
such conduct may serve as evidence of acting in concert.
The standard of proof required is a degree of certainty that goes beyond any
reasonable doubt. The burden of proof on the Commission cannot be shifted
simply by a finding of parallel conduct.
'In any event, if there is a plausible explanation for the conduct found to
exist which is consistent with an independent choice by the undertakings
concerned, concertation remains unproven,' he suggests.
According to the Advocate General, the main substantive problem with the
Commission's decision was its reliance on the producers' parallel behaviour
as the primary evidence of concerted action on announced prices, without
reliable corroboration.
The judgment of the ECJ is expected before the end of the year.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Technology: Compaq serves up a new PC range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREATENING to shake up the PC server market, Compaq Computer yesterday
launched a range of aggressively priced PCs designed to work as 'file
servers' on PC networks. File servers can enhance the performance of a PC
network by providing data retrieval services to all of the PCs on the
network.
By undercutting the prices of comparable machines from its rivals in the PC
market, Compaq hopes to accelerate the growth of network computing and lure
customers away from competitors. Currently about 30 per cent of PCs in the
US are linked to networks.
Compaq's new ProSignia PC servers address the 'mainstream' of the PC server
market with fully configured systems based upon Intel 486 microprocessors
ranging in price from Dollars 4,500 (Pounds 2,500) to Dollars 8,800 (Pounds
5,000). In addition, Compaq introduced a new high-end multiprocessor PC
server, the Systempro/XL, which the company claims is the world's fastest
computer of its type. Prices for the XL range from Dollars 14,000 to Dollars
22,300.
'The ProSignia and Systempro/XL will shake up the server marketplace just as
we shook up the desktop and notebook markets in June,' said Eckhard
Pfeiffer, Compaq president and chief executive, referring to Compaq's launch
of aggressively priced products that stimulated increased demand for PCs
while fuelling a vicious price war among PC makers.
With its lower-priced servers Compaq aims to attract buyers who would
otherwise have 'made do by cobbling together desktop clones' to act as
network servers, says Gary Stimac, senior vice president and general manager
of Compaq's systems group.
Compaq has previously not participated in this segment of the market, which
represents about half of PC server sales, he acknowledges. The Systempro/XL
represents Compaq's bid to participate in the trend towards corporate
'downsizing' in which minicomputers and mainframe computers are being
replaced by networks of PCs.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): Insuring against software
risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER software sometimes seems to defy common sense. To ensure the safety
of a load-bearing beam, an engineer typically doubles the thickness.
Applying the same approach to a piece of software simply multiplies the
risks of error.
The question of how safety and reliability can be built into computer
software is increasing in importance as critical social and industrial
processes - from the control of aircraft and power stations to financial
planning - yield to computerisation.
This dissemination of computer power will accelerate over the next few years
because of the growth of international computer networking.
Orders, invoices and payments will increasingly travel digitally across
continents and arrive as electronic documents.
The painstaking care needed to write fault-free programs can be difficult
for non-specialists to comprehend. But although there is widespread
awareness of the consequences of software errors, there is also a reluctance
among business managers and legislators to make greater efforts to
understand the way software is created and its limitations.
This reluctance manifests itself in a number of different ways. There is,
first, the question of whether software can be relied on not only to do what
is intended, but also to refrain from doing what is not intended.
An example is the issue of 'phantom' withdrawals from banks' automated
teller machines. The banks' argument has been that their machines are
infallible. A cursory glance at research into software dependability should
have convinced them that such claims are very difficult to sustain.
When software systems reach a certain size, there are simply too many
variables in play for all the potential consequences to be tested. The Stock
Exchange's Topic software failed during the first day of Big Bang six years
ago because of a fault which had lain undetected for years.
Second, there is the question of resistance to outside interference, whether
intentional or not. Breaking into a computer system from the outside may
seem much less probable than an inside job, but the volume of fraud related
to computer systems is no longer insubstantial.
All the signs are that it is an appreciable amount. But businesses are still
reluctant to expose the fragility of their computer systems by reporting
fraud, so the full extent of the damage is hard to measure.
This has the unfortunate side-effect of making actuarial assessment of the
risks difficult to quantify. Increasingly it may be necessary both for
companies and individuals to insure against the consequences of computer
fraud and failures.
The establishment of an actuarial database to help determine premiums would
be a step in the right direction.
Finally, when software has to be modified (and all major software has to be
modified or maintained), can the work be carried out economically, in the
time allowed and without introducing errors in other parts of the system?
The struggle most importers and exporters face to make their accounting
software ready to accommodate changes in Europe-wide VAT regulations next
year is just the latest in a series of computing fiascos caused by a lack of
understanding on the part of senior managers of just how long it takes to
make changes to established computer systems or develop new ones.
A danger is that pressures of time or resources might tempt software
developers to cut costs and corners.
There are a number of pieces of research into safe software, including the
European Commission's Predictably Dependable Computer Systems project, but
so far there have been no easy answers. Until there is a breakthrough,
awareness of the risks and a willingness to insure against them seems the
best defence.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Technology: Two heads are better than one - PCs are
competing for power with minicomputers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and GEOF WHEELWRIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The ambitions of personal computer manufacturers extend way beyond the
desktop. With the introduction of powerful, low-cost 'servers', the PC is
now invading the turf of minicomputers and mainframe computers, the
traditional workhorses of corporate computing.
Local area networks (Lans) that link PCs throughout a department or office
are already commonplace, but companies such as Compaq Computer, AST Research
and the newly formed IBM Personal Computer Company foresee an even broader
role for networked PCs.
To make the leap from a 'local' to an 'enterprise-wide' network, PCs need
access to high-powered 'servers' - machines that share computing, file
storage or other resources among all of the PCs linked to the network.
Enter a new generation of powerful 'multi-brained' PC servers; computer-age
hydras whose performance can be multiplied by the addition of extra
multiprocessor chips. These multiprocessor PCs boast the power of a
minicomputer at a fraction of the price.
AST Research, for example, recently launched the AST Manhattan SMP, a
multiprocessor system with four Intel microprocessors.
To hear Graham Hopper, UK general manager of AST Europe, talk, you would
think minicomputers were already extinct. 'The introduction of this class of
machine, with performance and reliability levels on a par with minis, is
like the minicomputer revolution of the 1970s with a difference. Whereas
minis replaced mainframes, multiprocessors will replace the minicomputer,'
he boasts.
IBM PC is also offering high-powered multiprocessor PCs which analysts say
will compete head to head with the parent company's mid-range AS/400
minicomputers.
Compaq Computer, meanwhile, which pioneered the multiprocessor PC with its
early SystemPro models, has this week launched a higher-performance version,
designated the XL model, that can process up to 185 transactions (or
information exchanges) per second, giving it higher data processing
capabilities than most minis. The XL is also upgradable so that users can
plug in new generations of Intel microprocessors as they become available,
or add extra microprocessors to boost performance further.
The appearance of these high-powered, low-cost machines represents the
latest salvo in the long-fought battle between PCs and minicomputers in the
office computer market.
Minicomputer manufacturers have long argued that PCs - no matter how fast
and powerful they became - could never replace minicomputers because they
were not designed to run large-scale applications and high volumes of
information processing.
Old-guard supporters of minicomputers say that comparing PCs to
minicomputers is like comparing the family car with a double-decker bus. You
might be able to shoehorn the power of a double-decker bus engine into the
engine compartment of a large car, but it would in no way be equipped to
handle the job of a bus. It would not have the gearbox to properly control
the engine, nor the physical capacity to take advantage of its power.
Indeed, PCs that act as central data storage systems for other desktop PCs
on a network - generally known as 'file servers' - have a reputation for
slowing to a crawl when too many users require their services at once.
PC makers now claim that the multiprocessor PC will eliminate the
information bottleneck by carrying out several tasks simultaneously in its
multiple brains.
However, there is a catch. Whereas a wealth of software has been developed
for minicomputers, there are relatively few programs designed to take full
advantage of the power of multiprocessor PCs. This is because the most
popular PC operating systems, MS-Dos and the Apple Macintosh operating
system, were designed for use on single-processor computers.
Currently Unix, and specifically a version of Unix developed by the Santa
Cruz Operation, a California software developer, represents the most popular
choice of operating system for multiprocessor PCs. New operating systems,
such as Microsoft's planned Windows NT and IBM's new OS/2 2.0, as well as
the operating system code named 'Pink' that IBM and Apple are developing
jointly, will also be able to handle multiprocessing.
But the real benefits of multiprocessing will not start to be felt until
users have access to applications optimised for use with multiprocessor
operating systems.
The lack of software standards has persuaded at least one player in the PC
market to steer away from multiprocessor PCs.
Texas-based Dell Computer has said it will wait until there are clearer
hardware, operating system and software standards before entering the field.
Multiprocessor PCs are still an 'almost' technology, says Patrick Murphy,
Dell vice president. 'We do not intend to introduce this kind of computer
until we think there are some good standards in the market - there is no
software to really run on them at the moment,' he says.
WorkGroup Technologies, a market research firm based in New Hampshire, bears
out Dell's view that multiprocessor PCs will find limited acceptance in the
short term. The market analysts estimated that only about 65,000
multiprocessor PCs will be sold this year.
The multiprocessor PC is none the less setting an important trend because it
promises to enable today's PC buyers to leverage their investment by
boosting the performance of PC networks in the future.
For PC manufacturers, the multiprocessor PC represents an opportunity to
move beyond the desktop price wars and find more profitable ground in
segments of the computer market that have traditionally been beyond their
reach.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Green light for
environmental issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Businesses are under increasing pressure to take account of environmental
issues, from the pressure groups, their customers, regulators, the public
and shareholders. Yet many companies do not know how to respond, writes
Charles Batchelor.
A Measure of Commitment - Guidelines for Measuring Environmental
Performance* provides practical advice on how to implement measurement
systems and to assess performance. The guidelines have been drawn up by
Business in the Environment (BIE), an offshoot of Business in the Community,
and accountants KPMG Peat Marwick.
Some larger companies have begun producing environmental reports but there
is a growing demand for more precise information. Environmental reports
lacking concrete detail will become as unacceptable as unquantified
financial reports, said BIE.
Environmental questions are also likely to become of more concern to smaller
companies, BIE said. Most of the 14 case histories used to illustrate the
guidelines are of large companies but BIE is seeking to make the same
techniques available to small and medium sized enterprises.
They are starting to come under pressure from their customers and are also
likely to be affected by the growth of formal environmental standards, such
as British Standard 7750, covering environmental management systems, and the
European Commission's draft proposal for what would be known as Eco-Audits.
A company may have already drawn up an environmental policy and have set
objectives, in which case it may need to move on to setting comprehensive
performance measures. Alternatively, it may just be starting to design a
policy and only want performance measures in priority areas, BIE said.
Companies should, however, be wary of choosing 'soft' areas which may be
viewed by the outside world as merely a public relations exercise.
Measurement systems may need to cover a wide range of areas including
processes or operations, suppliers, emissions into the air and of effluent
into sewers, solid waste, energy use and impact on natural resources.
Companies need to decide which areas should have priority. They may need to
set targets to reduce effluents, emissions and solid waste. They may wish to
eliminate hazardous materials from their products by a set date or improve
their ability to be recycled. In the corporate relations field, they may
want a procedure for public disclosure and consultation on environmental
matters or provide backing for environmental programmes.
The smallest company profiled in the guidelines, Hydro Aluminium Metals,
with 35 employees, concentrated on energy efficiency. It had previously
based its measures of gas and electricity consumption on suppliers' invoices
but moved to calculating consumption per tonne of aluminium processed and
measuring the percentage of waste heat re-used. A study of its melting
furnace revealed significant heat losses which could be reduced.
In a separate initiative BIE is working with Peat Marwick and the Institute
of Purchasing and Supply to draw up a voluntary code of practice to assess
supplier performance in environmental terms. It will consult business and
professional organisations before publishing its code in May, 1993.

manager - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
British businesses have become more ready to change their bank in recent
years, according to a survey* for Financial Director magazine carried out by
Manchester Business School (MBS).
One-fifth of the 670 finance directors polled had changed bank relationships
in the past five years, most in the past two.
Fewer than 8 per cent confined their banking business to a single bank and
European, American and Japanese banks had a foothold in a quarter of UK
corporate accounts.
Only half of respondents believed their bank provided dependable support in
a crises, while common complaints were of overcharging and attempting to
sell ineffective products. The customer charters published by many banks
last year had little effect, the finance directors said.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Boxing clever to keep
your title - Charles Batchelor looks at one way of limiting the damage when
a customer goes bust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With more than 1,200 businesses failing each week, you can be certain that
some of your customers will be among them. Suppliers often take the view
that there is little they can do to retrieve unpaid-for deliveries because
they will be sold off or used in the business by the receiver.
But there is a way to protect your interests. This is to write a 'retention
of title' clause into your terms and conditions. This allows a supplier to
hang on to the ownership of a consignment after it has been delivered and to
reclaim the goods if the customer goes bust.
Retention of title is not a new legal concept - it has been around since
1976 when what was known as the Romalpa case established new rights for
suppliers - but it has been given added urgency by the present recession.
This has prompted the London Chamber of Commerce to produce a guide.*
'Banks used to scoop the pool in receiverships,' says Mark Dyer, a partner
in the law firm, Clifford Chance. 'There wasn't even a race. But after the
Romalpa case, the odds moved in favour of suppliers.'
Chemco, a supplier of photographic equipment, film and plates, has found its
'retention of title' clause useful in dealing with many of the 46 customers
who went bust over the past 12 months, says Robert Kerr, financial
controller.
But while the clause has been useful in recovering equipment supplies, it
has been less helpful in recovering deliveries of the film and printing
plates, because it is less easy to identify them as having come from the
Amersham-based company. The important thing about your terms of trade,
including the retention of title clause, is that they are made clear to your
customer before, or at the time, that the contract is made. It is not enough
to print your terms on the back of invoices since these go out after the
contract has been struck.
Your terms need to be printed on every document you send out, from your
customer contract form, through orders and invoices to delivery notes.
'Don't worry about being boring,' says Colin Wiseman, a partner in Booth
White, insolvency specialists. If your terms are printed on the back of
contract documents, they must be clearly signposted on the front and they
must be printed large and clearly enough to be easily legible.
If you have long-established customers who are not aware of your terms of
trade, you should send them a copy by recorded delivery mail or with a
response form to acknowledge receipt. If you supply customers in response to
telephoned orders, without a written contract, you should send out a copy of
your terms and make clear that all future dealings will be on that basis.
If you add a retention of title clause to your terms, keep it simple. 'It is
easier to pick holes in a long clause,' says Dyer. 'Receivers work by
attrition. If there is anything to argue about in the clause, they will hold
on to your goods.'
It is important to win what the lawyers call the 'battle of the forms'. The
terms of a contract are determined by the last document which is sent out.
If you receive an order on your customer's order form, make sure that you
return an 'acknowledgement of order' form which carries your own terms.
If you hear that a customer has gone into receivership, you must let the
receiver know as soon as possible that you have a retention of title clause
in place. You should try to visit his premises and make an inventory of your
delivery.
The qualities needed to get your goods back are speed, insistence, energy
and litigation, says Dyer. 'You are dealing with people whose job is to give
nothing away.'
If need be, the threat of an injunction or a winding up petition can be used
to back your case, Dyer told a London Chamber of Commerce conference last
week. If a receiver disposes of goods which he could reasonably be expected
to think belonged to a supplier, he may be held personally liable.
Receivers, not unnaturally, believe that this approach is too strong. 'We
don't like having to hand back goods, so you must expect a fight,' says
Wiseman. 'But don't back the receiver into an entrenched position. Be firm
rather than nasty.'
The Romalpa legislation shifted the balance of power in favour of the
supplier but there are still limitations to the power of a retention clause.
They are:
The difficulty in applying it to service businesses. An accountant cannot
take back a set of accounts and a repair business cannot undo repairs.
A supplier cannot reclaim goods which have been sold on to a third party or
become part of another product. He cannot get back bricks which have gone
into a house or the resin that has gone into making a piece of chipboard. He
may, however, be able to reclaim a large electric motor in a factory which
needs only to be unbolted.
You must be able to identify your goods. Chemco is considering how it might
identify small deliveries of photographic paper, at present only traceable
through a batch number, by means of a delivery note number.
Unlike receivers, administrators have the right to ignore retention clauses.
The supplier could apply to the courts for a ruling but this might cost more
than the goods were worth.
In theory, a retention clause allows a supplier to reclaim the value of the
goods if they have been used or sold, but in practice, it has proved
impossible to so.
A retention of title clause is not a guarantee that you will get your goods
back, but not having one is as good as a guarantee that you will be the
loser.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Rover launches 200 coupe range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER GROUP, the vehicles subsidiary of British Aerospace, is entering the
market for sports coupes typified by the Opel/Vauxhall Calibra and
Volkswagen Corrado.
Its 200 coupe range will be unveiled at the Paris motor show today as the 12
millionth car to be built at Rover's Longbridge plant near Birmingham is
coming off the assembly line. This is scheduled to be one of the coupe
models, of which the 150mph 'flagship' 220 Turbo version is the fastest
production Rover ever built.
The coupes, which Rover is building at an initial rate of 360 a week, are
being launched into a depressed UK market.
Statistics to be released today by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders will confirm that, after a slight recovery in August, new car sales
in the UK last month slipped back below the level of a year before. They are
expected to show sales for the month of just over 120,000, some 3 per cent
to 4 per cent below those of September last year.
The Rover coupes, with UK prices of between Pounds 14,495 and Pounds 18,315
including taxes, represent the latest of a string of new model or model
derivative launches by Rover under an investment programme currently running
at Pounds 200m a year.
Next month sees the unveiling at the UK motor show of the RV8, the first MG
two-seater sports model since the factory in Abingdon, Oxfordshire that
produced the MGB closed a decade ago.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Barristers lose battle on rights of audience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAR claimed victory last night in the first round of the battle over
advocacy rights in the Crown Court, after Lord Mackay, the lord chancellor,
ruled out wider rights of audience for barristers employed by the Crown
Prosecution Service in the immediate future.
But Lord Mackay and the four senior judges designated under the 1990 Courts
and Legal Services Act to decide on rights of audience made clear that they
would keep the matter under review.
Lord Mackay said he had asked the Bar Council to consider a time limit of
December 1994 on its rule prohibiting employed barristers from appearing as
advocates in the higher courts.
He and the senior judges had decided they could not give permanent approval
to the rule as it now stands.
Lord Mackay said that once the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice had
reported next year, discussions could take place between the interested
parties on further amendments to the rule.
Mr Peter Goldsmith QC, head of the Bar's legal services committee, said:
'The lord chancellor and the four designated judges have rejected the calls
of the CPS for increased rights of audience now.'
The Bar welcomed the importance they had attached to frequency of use of
advocacy rights and the need for independence.
Mr Goldsmith said: 'We object strongly to the idea of a monopoly state
prosecutor. Advocates independent of the state who both defend and prosecute
are necessary to uphold the integrity of the system.'
The CPS and the Government Legal Service (GLS), however, placed a different
interpretation on the lord chancellor's statement, calling it 'a significant
step forward in the campaign for extended rights of audience for employed
lawyers'.
A statement issued on behalf of Mrs Barbara Mills QC, director of public
prosecutions, and Sir James Nursaw, head of the GLS, said: 'We believe this
will begin the process of removing the restrictions which prevent employed
barristers appearing as advocates in the higher courts however well trained
and experienced they are.' Their views were supported by the Law Society,
which represents solicitors.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Industry defends use of orimulsion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE orimulsion industry yesterday hit back at suggestions that it was a
'dirty fuel', after last week's statement by the pollution inspector-ate
that tougher environ-mental controls may be needed.
Mr Manuel de Oliveira, the chief executive of BP Bitor, the BP-Venezuelan
joint venture which is seeking to import orimulsion into the UK to be burnt
by power stations, said: 'It is a fact that all present and proposed uses of
orimulsion comply in every respect with current health, safety and
environmental legislation.'
He emphasised that orimulsion, a bitumen-based fuel, has a better
environmental performance than coal.
Last week, the Inspectorate of Pollution agreed to a delay in an application
by National Power to burn orimulsion at power stations in Pembroke and
Padiham, Lancs, saying it would require more environmental safeguards than
were being proposed.
'We shall do whatever we can to assist that process,' Mr de Oliveira said.
He warned that there could be no justi-fication for discriminatory action
against one energy resource.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Nuclear safety levels set
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFETY standards at future nuclear power stations should be set so that the
risk to the public is 10 times smaller than the danger of a road accident,
according to new guidelines published yesterday by the Health and Safety
Executive, the industrial safety regulator.
The HSE's report is a response to the 1986 public inquiry into the Sizewell
B nuclear reactor, which called for standards on the tolerable level of risk
to the public from nuclear power.
The HSE concludes: 'We propose to adopt a risk (of death to a member of the
public) of 1 in 100,000 a year as the benchmark for new nuclear power
stations in the UK'. It compares that with the risk of 1 in 10,000 of dying
in a traffic accident, 1 in 13,000 of a woman dying in childbirth, or 1 in
1,000,000 of dying in a fire or gas explosion at home.
The report differs from the HSE's preliminary 1988 study in that human error
is brought into the models, increasing some of the estimates of risk.
The HSE's consultation document applies only to future nuclear power
stations. Mr John Rimington, the HSE's director-general, said: 'We do not
know how to quantify the risk from the Magnox stations' - the oldest of
Britain's reactors. He added: 'What we do know is that they are enormously
robust.'
The HSE intends its recommendations to be part of the debate about the
future of Britain's nuclear power industry. However, no new nuclear power
stations are likely to be built until the completion of the government study
into nuclear power's future, due in 1994.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Bank's assets are frozen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVISIONAL liquidators brought in to the London-based Mount Banking
Corporation by the Bank of England at the weekend froze its assets
yesterday.
None of the 3,000 depositors, most of whom appear to be Kenyan Asians
resident overseas, will be able to withdraw money over the next few days
while the financial position of the bank is clarified.
The Bank of England took the highly unusual step of applying to the High
Court on Saturday for a winding-up petition. Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Philip
Wallace of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, were appointed joint
provisional liquidators.
Mr Tudor Roberts, company secretary and one of the solicitors to Mount
Banking, said last night that the petition was issued 'without notice' and
that the directors 'know of no grounds to explain the shutdown' of the bank.
The Bank of England has powers under Section 92 of the 1987 Banking Act to
apply to the High Court for a winding-up petition as laid down in the 1986
Insolvency Act.
In a statement issued at the weekend, it emphasised that it did not allege
insolvency as one of the grounds for the petition, and was acting in the
interests of depositors on 'just and equitable grounds'.
Mount Banking also meets another requirement for authorisation - the
so-called 'four eyes criterion', in other words that there is more than one
person controlling the business. Mount Banking has six directors.
That leaves two other issues: whether a bank is conducting its business
prudently, and whether the directors and managers have exercised fit and
proper control for the positions they occupy.
The Bank of England is shortly to present further details to support its
petition to the High Court, and could apply as soon as next week for
liquidation.
Mount Banking was authorised by the Bank of England in 1983. Of its
depositors, only about 50 are resident in the UK. Deposits in the bank total
more than Pounds 166m.
The provisional liquidators said yesterday that they expected 'substantially
all' the creditors to be repaid. Any new deposits will now be controlled
separately until the position is clarified.
According to the latest set of accounts for the year to March 31 this year,
the bank made a loss of Pounds 900,000, compared with a loss of Pounds
678,000 in the previous 12 months. Total assets of the group were Pounds
200.5m, against liabilities of Pounds 170.7m.
Mount Banking has a Cayman Islands subsidiary called Mount Bank Cayman,
which has about Pounds 10.5m in assets.
The remaining shares are held directly by I&amp;M Holdings, a trust based in
Jersey, which is also the ultimate parent of the group. The beneficiaries of
the trust are the Shah family, of which three members are on the board.
These directors are Mr Dilip Chandulal Shah, the general manager, who lives
in London; Mr Navinchandra Bhagwanji Shah, deputy chairman; and Mr Suresh
Bhagwanji Raja Shah, chairman, who both give addresses in Kenya.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDELY VARYING fees are being charged by Training and Enterprise Councils
for assessing companies applying for the Investors in People kitemark.
A survey by Personnel Management, the magazine of the Institute of Personnel
Management, found that charges varied from Pounds 150 to Pounds 400 a day.
The kitemark is being promoted by Tecs and the government as potentially one
of the most important indicators of good training and personnel practices
within a company - assessing, for example, whether companies regularly
review individuals' personal development plans.
The government has not given Tecs any specific funding for assessing
employers' eligibility, but it allows assessors to charge up to Pounds 500 a
day.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Scientist warns on passive smoking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING cancer researcher urged employers yesterday to ensure staff did
not have to suffer passive smoking at work, Lisa Wood writes.
Sir Richard Doll, a consultant with the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, said
that about 0.5 per cent to 1 per cent of all cancers were caused by tobacco
smoke at work.
Urging companies to support next week's European Week Against Cancer, Sir
Richard said, 'People have a right to work in a smoke-free area, and there
is no reason why they should have other peoples' carcinogens passed on to
them.
'It is an employer's responsibility to provide a smoke-free atmosphere for
workers if they want it,' he added.
Meanwhile, the National Asthma Campaign, the Health Education Authority and
the Ulster Cancer Foundation are supporting a move by Action on Smoking and
Health (Ash) to bring a test case over passive smoking at work.
According to a legal opinion published by Ash, non-smokers may be able to
sue their employers for damage caused to their health by passive smoking.

<TEXT>
ONE OF very few autograph bullfighting scenes by Goya is to be offered at
auction at Sotheby's in London in December. It is the first important
subject picture by the artist to appear on the market without export
restrictions for decades. A price of Pounds 4m to Pounds 6m is expected.
The picture was painted in Paris in 1824 for Goya's compatriot and political
exile, Joacqun Mara Ferrer, and is being auctioned by his descendants.
Goya appears to have used a palette knife and even his fingers to create an
emotive and thickly impasted paint surface. According to a Sotheby's expert,
the picture is in 'almost perfect condition'.
The auction record for a Goya is Pts 78.4m (Pounds 315,569).

FT  06 OCT 92 / Vocational study sees maths gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOCATIONAL qualifications should be strengthened in their mathematics
component, according to a study that compares the UK with France.
The study, published by the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research, concludes that maths teaching in France was more successful partly
because all vocational students studied a core mathematics curriculum of a
consistent standard.
In the UK, there was no core curriculum of mathematics and the new
employer-led vocational qualifications provided little incentive for its
teaching.
The author of the study, Mrs Alison Wolf, senior research officer and
research lecturer at the Institute of Education at the University of London,
said: 'This neglect of a core subject area hinders progression within the
qualifications system, depresses attainment and lowers aspirations of both
teachers and students.'
The study recommends specifying mathematical skills and formal examination
of mathematics in vocational courses.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Building society mergers warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUILDING society mergers involve more snags than is generally realised and
firm guidelines must be followed to ensure the combined society is strong,
according to Touche Ross Management Consultants.
Its report appears when many large and medium-sized building societies
concede privately that mergers are necessary to enable them to survive until
the end of the decade. Even so, there has not been a merger of two top ten
societies for more than five years because of the difficulties involved.
Touche Ross said that mergers between societies of relatively equal size are
more difficult than those between a large society and a small one, and such
mergers often turn out worse financially.
It says that both sides involved have to define business objectives clearly
at the outset and keep track at each stage of whether financial and other
targets are being met.
Touche Ross says that even when managers on the two sides have the best of
intentions, a merger creates a new management team that may find itself
operating in an entirely different business context from those of either
society before the merger.
Touche Ross identifies information systems strategy as the second-greatest
area of difficulty for merged societies. Combining the computer systems of
two societies may take several years and it may be impossible to serve all
customers of the combined new society at every branch.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Markets exact revenge for policy vacuum: Treasury stays
silent as sterling suffers early free fall; Equities slump; Construction
jobs going 'at rate of 580 a day'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL markets began to exact their revenge yesterday for the vacuum in
UK economic policymaking.
Sterling seemed in free fall before stabilising somewhat in the afternoon.
UK equities slumped.
Throughout all, the Treasury remained silent, commenting neither on the
pound's weakness nor shedding any new light on government economic policy.
In the City, the mood among analysts and economists was one of increasing
despair.
When Britain proved incapable of maintaining the old DM2.95 central rate in
the European exchange rate mechanism last month, the government chose to
float the pound in the belief that it would permit a 'British monetary
policy' geared to British needs.
After sterling's steep decline to below DM2.40 from its ERM floor of
DM2.778, there are still some advocates of lower interest rates to help
stimulate the domestic economy. But there are also suggestions for
sharper-than-planned cuts in public spending, increased taxes and even
higher interest rates.
In large part, the confusion reflects the overlapping of two crises. There
is the continuing recession at home, which advocates of lower interest rates
are above all anxious to address. Superimposed on that has been the slump in
sterling's value, which has raised old fears of inflation. How policymakers
respond to those two difficulties will ultimately depend on how Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, and his advisers assess the inflationary pressures
prevailing in the UK.
But, in the meantime, financial markets have to make their own calculations
about which policy option will form part of the government's economic
strategy.
Lower UK interest rates were until recently a widely expected consequence of
Britain's decision to float the pound. The bigger-than-usual cut of 1
percentage point in base rates to 9 per cent from 10 per cent on September
22 was meant to underline the new freedom that Mr Lamont had secured for UK
policy. Some City economists, such as Mr Roger Bootle and Mr Simon Briscoe
of Midland Montagu, believe further cuts in interest rates are necessary for
recovery. They are seeking base rate reductions 'to 8 per cent soon and 6
per cent by next spring'. However, expectations of an early cut in interest
rates have fallen with sterling's value.
Opponents of lower rates point out that sterling's decline has eased
domestic monetary conditions. By yesterday evening, sterling was 12.3 per
cent lower than its average for August, against the Bank of England's
trade-weighted basket of currencies. A rule of thumb based on the Treasury's
model of the economy suggests that a devaluation on that scale is equivalent
to a drop of 3 percentage points in bank base rates. Since floating, the UK
has therefore achieved the equivalent of cutting interest rates from 10 per
cent to 6 per cent if the pound had stayed in the ERM.
Some economists, such as Mr Bill Martin, the chief economist of UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, say that the government should 'lie back and enjoy' the effects of
the pound's fall. A weaker pound will encourage exports by making them
cheaper and in the long term help to correct the UK's main economic trouble
of too small a manufacturing base. But such a philosophy depends crucially
on the belief that inflationary pressures are so weak that the sharp fall in
sterling's value will not pass through quickly into retail prices and
pressure for higher wages.
Until late last week, many City economists thought that the price impact of
the devaluation would be limited and that the average annual growth of
retail prices was unlikely to rise above 5 per cent in the foreseeable
future. Sterling's subsequent fall has dented those hopes to some extent.
According to Mr Kevin Gardiner, UK economist at SG Warburg Securities: 'It
probably means that the devaluation is now past the 'free lunch' stage.'
Indeed, there are some who would say that the pound's fall merits hairshirt
treatment. One government economist, who declined to be identified, said
yesterday that sterling's fall justified a move back up in base rates to 11
per cent.
Advocates of such a move argue that the government must take steps to
stabilise and strengthen the pound not only to prevent a lift-off in
inflation but to bolster the current-account balance of payments.
Devaluation, they argue, is not enough to solve the difficulty of monthly
current-account deficits of more than Pounds 1bn. What is required is more
saving in the economy, so that resources are channelled into exports.
But higher interest rates would be politically devastating for the
government and would doubtless have a deeply negative impact on consumers
and industrialists. Many city economists also point out that on Black
Wednesday, two interest rate increases to 15 per cent from 10 per cent
failed to bolster the pound.
The troubles surrounding monetary policy have caused the government and the
City to turn their attention back to fiscal policy. Shortly after sterling
floated, Mr Lamont made clear that departure from the ERM would add to the
pressures on the government to keep planned public spending within the
Pounds 244.5bn total targeted for 1993-94.
More recently, there have been hints that taxes may have to be raised and
that spending will have to be kept unchanged in 1994-95. Higher taxes would
represent a humiliating climbdown for the government from its election
manifesto promises and would almost certainly be a last-resort measure. But
their appearance in the policy debate gives some idea of the pressures being
placed on ministers in spending departments to settle the current
public-expenditure round within the pre-set target for next month's Autumn
Statement.
Next month is a long way away for financial markets and the slump of
sterling underlines their impatience with the government's failure to spell
out its policies.
Pressure is therefore mounting on Mr Lamont to clarify his monetary plans.
The worry that must be haunting the chancellor, and which certainly is
preoccupying the City, is that when he does so, there will be no respite for
sterling or UK financial markets because Britain's departure from the ERM
has so completely shattered the government's credibility.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Consumer credit advances fall again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CREDIT advanced to consumers by finance houses, building societies and
credit cards in the Visa or Mastercard system totalled Pounds 3.82bn in
August compared with Pounds 4.25bn in July, the Central Statistical Office
reported yesterday. The August figure was one of the lowest of the year.
The figures showed that consumers avoided buying goods on credit in August,
preferring instead to pay back their debts.
The latest official credit business figures show that consumers repaid a net
Pounds 30m in August, undermining hopes of a slight high street recovery. In
July there was a net increase in credit of Pounds 78m.
The seasonally adjusted figures also showed a sharp fall in demand for
credit in the three months to the end of August. Consumers repaid a net
Pounds 7m after increasing borrowings by Pounds 109m in the three months to
the end of May.
Although the figures represent only about 15 per cent of total
private-sector debt - they do not include mortgages - they provide a useful
snapshot of consumer activity.
August's Pounds 30m repayment of consumer credit compares with net
borrowings of Pounds 226m in August 1990, and Pounds 13m in August last
year, reflecting the priority consumers have attached to repaying debts
since the recession began.
In August, net lending on credit cards increased by Pounds 3m against July's
increase of Pounds 29m. Lending on credit cards slowed over the three months
to the end of August, growing by only Pounds 30m compared with Pounds 248m
in the three months to the end of May.
According to the CSO, there was Pounds 29.76bn of credit outstanding at the
end of August compared with Pounds 29.85bn at the end of July.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Building chief condemns Lamont's 'lack of action'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION leaders yesterday condemned the government for failing to help
the recession-wracked industry.
Sir Brian Hill, president of the Building Employers Confederation, said he
had tried to explain the severity of the recession to Mr John Major, the
prime minister, and to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, but that 'so far
there has been no real response in terms of government action'.
Sir Brian also highlighted job losses in the industry. He said jobs had been
shed at the rate of 580 for each working day for three years.
He added that 400,000 jobs had been lost during the past three years. A
further 50,000 jobs were like to disappear between June and the end of this
year, taking the total to more than 450,000.
Sir Brian joined civil engineers, architects and surveyors in London to
launch a 'battle bus' to travel to the Conservative conference.
Industry leaders will beg ministers not to cut money for construction in the
autumn public-spending round. They also want a cut in interest rates and
measures to help the housing market such as higher thresholds for mortgage
tax relief and the scrapping of stamp duty.
'We look to the chancellor's Autumn Statement to sustain public investment
in vital capital building programmes,' said Sir Brian. 'Instead, we read
increasingly of the threat of cuts to our capital spending programmes. So we
are now intensifying our lobbying efforts.'
A survey published yesterday by the confederation shows a further
deterioration in building industry workloads and will increase pressure on
the government.
It shows that confidence over future workloads has slipped even further,
with an increasing number of firms planning to shed workers in the next few
months. A fifth of companies questioned were working at less than half
capacity. The number of new inquiries for work was at its lowest level since
last year.
The survey was conducted in September among 600 of the confederation's 7,000
member companies. Ucatt, the construction union, warned yesterday that the
number of jobs lost in the industry might rise to 500,000 if the government
cut its Pounds 2bn housing budget.

FT  06 OCT 92 / DTI chosen for deep funding cuts: Conservative conference to
open today amid ministerial struggle over public spending Euro rebels meet
to plan strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET ministers are set to order deep cuts in the research and development
budget for next year as Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
becomes the latest victim of the harsh negotiatons over public spending.
The latest cuts highlight the enormous difficulty faced by the Treasury as
it attempts to curb spending.
Last night two former Tory cabinet ministers predicted that the current
crisis might force the government to increase taxes even if it succeeds in
meeting its public expenditures targets for the next financial year.
Speaking on BBC1's Panorama programme, Lord Tebbit, former trade and
industry secretary, said Britain's 'excessivly large' public sector
borrowing requirement meant that tax increases 'could come' if it were
necessary to convince the markets that the government meant what it said
about controlling inflation and borrowing.
'It would seem to me that we need at the very least a tight control of
public spending - perhaps actual reductions of planned public expenditure,'
he said.
Lord Howe, former chancellor and foreign secretary, said getting a grip on
public sector borrowing 'may involve raising taxes' although cutting
non-investment expenditure would be a preferable option.
The Department of Trade and Industry has been told that its already modest
bid for R&amp;D spending will have to be trimmed still further.
Ministers on the 'EDX' public spending committee of the cabinet yesterday
continued to review how department budgets can be cut to allow for the
unforeseen costs of the recession within, or below, the pre-agreed Pounds
244.5bn planning total for the 1993-94 financial year. Drastic measures,
such as a freeze in public sector pay, are being actively considered.
Formal negotiations will be suspended during this week's Conservative party
conference. But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has cleared time in his
diary on every day next week, except the Monday for possible EDX meetings.
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, last night said the conference would
back government policy of keeping a tight control on public spending because
such a pledge had been a significant element of the manifesto for April's
general election.
Ironically, cuts are being forced on Mr Heseltine even though he is a member
of the EDX committee. He was included because the DTI budget is regarded as
small-scale in Whitehall, arguably making him more objective.
DTI insiders say that because officials recognised there would have to be
tough spending decisions and wanted to co-operate, the department had
originally bid for less than it would have liked for R&amp;D in 1993-94. DTI
spending on civil R&amp;D is about Pounds 133.5m in the current year.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Fowler may heed reformist pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Norman Fowler, Conser-vative party chairman, has acknowledged that he
may be forced to bow to the demands of grassroots activists for a special
meeting of the Conservatives' policymaking central council to make the party
more democratic and accountable.
A pressure group called the Party Reform Steering Committee has won the
support of the 50 constituency parties necessary to demand an extraordinary
meeting of the central council, which is composed of constituency activists,
MPs, MEPs and peers.
The pressure group wants the council to establish a party executive
committee, with at least half its members elected by a postal ballot of the
central council, which would take over responsibility for Conservative
Central Office and the party's central funds.
The chairman of that committee would be elected, but the pressure group says
the new office would be non-political, dealing only with party matters, and
would not replace the current party chairmanship, which is a political
appointment.
At a Conservative conference fringe meeting in Brighton last night, Mr
Michael Normington, chairman of the pressure group, pressed for an early
meeting of the central council.
He said the group would take 'a very dim view' of verification of
constituency letters of support being used as an excuse for delay. Mr
Normington has been critical of those in the party hierarchy who he says
have been putting pressure on constituencies not to support the group.
Sir Norman told the FT that he hoped his own strategy to make the party's
decision-making more accountable through the creation of a new executive
board would meet many of the demands of grassroots supporters. The board
would give constituencies the role they have sought in overseeing Central
Office decisions.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Banks defend actions on Pounds deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLEARING banks hit back yesterday against allegations from politicians
that they have made huge speculative profits out of sterling's withdrawal
from the European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Peter Wood, finance director of Barclays Bank - speaking for all UK
clearing banks - said Bank of England regulations made it impossible that
any of them could have made enormous profits from trading in sterling on
September 16 when the currency was taken out of the ERM.
'We have limits on the open positions we can run,' he said. The limits were
partly banks' internal constraints; partly Bank of England restrictions.
As a result, even had the banks been convinced that sterling would fall
sharply below its ERM floor - as it did on September 16 - they were unable
to carry a big negative position. When a bank has a negative position, it
has sold currency that it does not have.
Mr Wood said the big profits from selling the pound were made by investment
banks, some of which are not regulated by the Bank of England; fund
management groups; and companies' treasury departments.
'On the Wednesday we at Barclays bought almost exactly Pounds 1bn from
non-banks (investment banks and fund managers),' he said. 'That is two or
three times the amount we would typically buy from these institutions.' Mr
Wood admitted that the clearing banks made good profits from trading in
sterling on the day, although Barclays' profit was significantly less than
Pounds 100m.
He said the bulk of profits derived from marketmaking by taking a dealing
turn, rather than by taking a speculative position. In other words, it was
the volume of trading in the market that benefited the banks most, rather
than the direction of sterling's price.
The British Bankers' Association said the banks had been stung into
defending their behaviour in the foreign markets by politicians' allegations
that they had made vast windfall profits. They were particularly concerned
at the suggestion by Lord Callaghan, the former Labour prime minister, that
there should be a special windfall tax on banks' dealing profits.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Unions broaden scope of lobbying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON and DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year's Conservative party conference is providing further evidence that
unions are serious about broadening the scope of their political lobbying.
After Labour's fourth consecutive election defeat, the traditional
demonstration outside the conference is being replaced with a more
professional lobbying of government and Tory MPs.
The UCW postal workers' union is leading the way with a reception today to
which it has invited 200 MPs to discuss the privatisation of the Parcelforce
subsidiary of the Post Office. Delegates from Swan Hunter, the troubled
Tyneside ship builder, are also expected in Brighton.
Inspired by the government's reduced majority, unions believe it is worth
lobbying Tory MPs on the forthcoming Employment Bill, especially on points
that enjoy only lukewarm support from employers.
Leaders of the Trades Union Congress were in Brighton yesterday to lobby
against the abolition of the wages councils, which set minimum pay rates in
several service industries. Abolition is expected in the Employment Bill
although, contrary to the TUC's literature, Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment
secretary, is unlikely to mention abolition in her speech on Thursday.
Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, said that the abolition of wages
councils would be a signal for employers to cut wages for many more workers
than the 2.4m covered by the councils.
He also said that abolition would have a disproportionate effect on women's
pay.
Mr David McCrossen, a Brighton-based official of Usdaw, the shopworkers'
union, said that since wages councils rulings had stopped being applicable
to people under 21, he knew of 18-year-old hairdressing assistants earning
Pounds 1 an hour. He also cited a local 16-year-old kitchen worker on 61.5p
an hour, Pounds 24 for a 39-hour week.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Kiss-me-quick gives way to the stiff upper lip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEVER underestimate the dogged loyalty of the Conservative party's poor
bloody infantry. Four election victories on, after all, most of those
travelling to Brighton had expected this year's conference to be a riotous
celebration.
But on the prom yesterday, kiss-me-quick hats had given way to stiff upper
lips, braced against an equally stiff southerly wind, choppy waters in the
stock market and the news that sterling had plunged yet a further few
pfennigs. It seems triumphalism has made way for a mood more akin to the
Dunkirk spirit.
Asked who to blame for the continuing recession, Mr Grenville Horsfall, a
dour-faced manager from Halifax's 'amusement industry', was in no doubt.
'It's the Bundesbank,' he said, definitively absolving our embattled
chancellor and blaming it on the Germans.
Mr Norman Lamont, he insisted, could not be held responsible for the
policies of Mr Helmut Kohl, the German leader, adding for comfort's sake
that in the long term the downturn would be 'a mere blip on the screen'.
And how was West Yorkshire bearing up? 'Well, they couldn't be any more
against us than they were at the election,' butted in a companion, clearly
trying to be helpful: 'And we didn't do too badly then.'
All around the barricades of the Grand Hotel, a thin blue line of Sussex's
finest stared out to sea, ready for most eventualities short of a full-blown
invasion. Outside brave faces and robust sentiments were the order of the
day.
A retired test pilot and his wife from Northern Ireland were ready to pay
for their patriotism from their pocketbooks.
'I was skiing in France this year with the pound at FFr11, next year it will
be FFr8,' the pilot said. 'I think they should raise taxes to give a message
to people that we are serious.'
However, what was less clear among a random sample of representatives - as
Conservatives at the conference are called - was what exactly the grassroots
want the leadership to show it is serious about.
There was a surprisingly clear message of support for the chancellor with
representatives unanimously rejecting the calls for his resignation and
emphasising that he had only been acting under prime ministerial orders when
he devalued the pound. But views differed strongly over Britain's future
relationship with the European Community.
In spite of Mr John Major's insistence that the Maastricht treaty must be
ratified, many argued for caution. And there was scepticism bordering on
outright opposition about any return to the European exchange rate
mechanism.
Mr Jerry Froggett, a 21-year-old Leeds history student, was typical of many
when he argued that Britain should be 'at the heart of Europe' while at the
same time staying out of the ERM and rewriting the Maastricht treaty.
Councillor David Bradbury of Dulwich, south London, a 30-year-old civil
servant dressed in the tweed and brogues beloved by young fogeys, argued
similarly that the prime minister should take the ratification of the treaty
'slower rather than faster'.
'Denmark must be accommodated,' he stressed, observing apparently without
ironic intent that the party was less ill at ease than during the challenge
to the leadership of the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher.
Mr Phil McCullough, a retired Jaguar salesman from Hackney, east London,
disagreed at least about Denmark. While emphasising that 'drastic decisions'
had to be made, he counselled that the prime minister should proceed
cautiously and ratify the treaty.
'There is a lot of support for Major,' he insisted, adding almost as an
afterthought. 'The consensus is: we would not like to be in his shoes.'

FT  06 OCT 92 / Carey calls for more foreign aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARCHBISHOP of Canterbury, Dr George Carey, intervened yesterday in the
campaign to protect Britain's overseas aid budget from government
expenditure cuts.
The archbishop, in a speech in which he defended the church's right to
express views on political issues, called on the government to have the
'moral courage and the moral self-respect' to increase aid.
'I do not underestimate the financial difficulties and political pain which
the government faces,' he said. 'But if we think the going is rough here,
let us remember the calamities unfolding in other parts of the world
struggling with the catastrophe of mass starvation, chronic poverty and
disease.'
Dr Carey's comments came as Mr David Bryer, director of Oxfam, one of
Britain's leading overseas aid charities, expressed fears that the Treasury
was seeking cuts of up to 15 per cent in the Overseas Development
Administration budget.
Dr Carey said in London that many people feared they had no 'real stake' in
Britain.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Sceptics warm to Euro showdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY Euro-sceptics were openly relishing the prospect of a head-on
confrontation with the party leadership yesterday as they put the final
touches to their tactics for rallying support among grassroots activists
during the conference.
Rebel MPs held a private meeting in the afternoon to plan their strategy for
the conference debates proper and for the fringe.
Mr John Major, however, used his speech to the annual eve-of-conference
dinner for Tory party agents to reaffirm his own commitment to the
Maastricht treaty.
The prime minister told them that his aim was for a European Community run
in British interests, and warned that abandoning the agreement would mean no
British government was ever taken seriously again in EC negotiations.
Evidence of dissent was again apparent with the publication of several
emergency amendments to conference motions on Europe and the economy, urging
that the Maastricht treaty should not be ratified and that sterling should
not rejoin the European exchange rate mechanism.
The amendments are unlikely to be voted on, but organisers promised that the
full range of opinion would be reflected in discussion.
Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman, said 'every worthwhile facet of debate'
would be expressed. In a signal that the leadership wants to play down the
fringe meetings, at which former cabinet ministers are expected to be among
those challenging government policy, he added: 'The major action at this
conference will not be at fringe meetings, it will be at the conference
itself.'
Looking beyond the conference, the most outspoken Euro-sceptics predicted
that if Mr Major proceeded with the Maastricht bill it might prove to be his
downfall, with one hinting that revolt might spread to other issues.
Equating such a move with 'opening up the Russian front', Mr Tony Marlow
said the only way Mr Major could secure the bill would be by a coalition
with the Labour party.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Homelessness will rise, housing authority warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor and ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOMELESSNESS will increase and council waiting lists lengthen unless the
government doubles the number of new homes provided each year for rent,
according to a study published yesterday by the Housing Corporation, which
funds and supervises registered housing associations.
The study, by two researchers from the London School of Economics, says that
100,000 additional homes for rent will be needed each year for the next 10
years. Government plans - under review as part of this year's
public-expenditure round - are for an average of 51,000 housing association
homes for each of the next three years.
The study is the latest in a series of authoritative reports to suggest that
government housing plans are inadequate.
The Audit Commission, the local-government watchdog, estimated in May that
an extra 74,000 homes a year would be needed over the next decade. An
earlier study by the Institute of Housing put the figure at 130,000 homes a
year, while the Association of District Councils said that the figure should
be between 75,000 and 115,000 a year.
The Housing Corporation suggests that 80,000 of the 100,000 additional units
would have to be new homes. The balance could come from reducing vacancies,
buying in homes built for sale and other sources.
In the present depressed climate of private investment in housing, the study
concludes that to maintain the present level of government provision would
almost certainly increase waiting lists, homelessness and the number of
concealed households. That would be exacerbated by the drive to transfer
rented housing to owner-occupation.
A Review of Housing Needs Assessment. The Housing Corporation, 149 Tottenham
Court Road, London W1P 0BN. Pounds 3.
THE NUMBER of new private homes started by builders fell sharply during the
summer, according to figures published yesterday by the Department of the
Environment, Andrew Taylor writes.
They show that private house starts during the first eight months fell by 7
per cent compared with the corresponding period last year.
If that trend continued for the rest of this year, the total number of
housing starts by private builders would be the lowest for more than
adecade.
According to the department, private housing starts fell by more than a
tenth in the June to August period, compared with the corresponding three
months last year.
The fall was offset by a 38 per cent increase in public-sector starts,
including those made by housing associations, which have taken over
councils' role of providing social housing.
Overall public and private starts fell by 3.6 per cent compared with the
June to August period.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow environment secretary, said: 'The latest house
building figures are terrible. House building in 1992 will almost certainly
be the worst of any year since the war.'
The total number of homes started by builders in August was 12,600 - almost
6 per cent fewer than during the corresponding month last year.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Tories take a rose-tinted glance back: Philip Stephens says
that in these troubled times the party is taking refuge in nostalgia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the Conservative party is in trouble, its first instinct is to take
refuge in nostalgia. So as Mr Norman Lamont scours the Treasury's filing
cabinets for an economic policy to replace the European exchange rate
mechanism, the Conservatives are rediscovering a new golden age.
The economic 'miracle' of the late 1980s, when the then Mr Nigel Lawson came
up with the hat-trick of lower taxes, higher public spending and a
public-sector surplus, is not a contender. The economy after all is still
suffering the hangover from that particular party.
Instead, Tory MPs are looking back to the first term of the then Mrs
Margaret Thatcher.
Through the flattering prism of time, the ideological certainties of the
early 1980s offer a seductive alternative to the confusing and chaotic
pragmatism of the start of the 1990s.
The picture being painted by many among the younger generation of Tory MPs -
as well as those like Lord Parkinson and Baroness Thatcher herself - is of
an era when the Conservative party knew where it was going.
It was not that life was easy then - the recession was deeper than now and
unemployment was rising more quickly. But the government (or at least Mrs
Thatcher) was resolute and stuck to its principles. That ushered in the
period of steady economic growth and low inflation that foundered only when
Lord Lawson started shadowing the D-Mark.
The distorting simplicity of the analogy is taken further. The early 1980s
were a period when economic policy could be set in splendid isolation from
the rest of Europe. What mattered was not the exchange rate but Mrs
Thatcher's magic money supply targets. Interest rates could be slashed
without reference to the value of the pound. The government then was serious
about cutting public spending and made the hard decisions that allowed the
subsequent tax cuts.
There is an obvious symmetry in the parallel with Mr John Major's present
predicament - even if it ignores the awkward fact that this time the Labour
party cannot be blamed for runaway public spending and a soaring budget
deficit.
Senior ministers admit that the monetary policy that Mr Lamont will preview
this week will bear a remarkable resemblance to that followed by the then
Sir Geoffrey Howe and Lord Lawson before the latter became mesmerised by the
exchange rate in 1985.
There will be targets for broad and narrow money, the value of the pound
will be taken into account, and Mr Lamont will keep an eye on the prices of
houses and shares. The devaluation of the pound will be have to be offset by
a tighter fiscal policy.
There are obvious political attractions. The message that Sir Norman Fowler,
party chairman, will spell out at the opening session of the conference this
morning is that the party came through the troubles of the early 1980s by
sticking together. It can again make a virtue out of its willingness to take
the 'tough decisions'.
However, while the comparison is seductive it does not stand up to scrutiny.
Those who look back to the party conferences of the early 1980s through
other than rose-tinted spectacles recall not a united front but a bitter
struggle between the 'wets' and the 'dries' over economic policy.
They remember also that, for all the talk that a free-floating pound
provides complete freedom, to reduce borrowing costs, the level of interest
rates only once (and then for just two brief months) fell below 9 per cent
during Lady Thatcher's first two terms in government.
And as Mr Lamont admitted in a speech as long ago as July, the policy
eventually was jettisoned because the same people who are now reconstructing
it decided that it did not work. But then, nostalgia never did have much
respect for reality.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Book publishers shrug off the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOOK publishers may have suffered some bad months this year but over the
past 10 years they have enjoyed real growth of 35 per cent.
Even during the recession, publishers appear to have maintained turnover in
real terms, according to statistics from the Publishers Association, the
industry trade body.
The PA Book Trade Year Book 1992, compiled by Mr Francis Fishwick, a
publishing specialist at the Cranfield School of Management, shows a Pounds
2.5bn UK book market with exports well in excess of Pounds 500m. There are
also additional earnings from rights sales and publishing activities
overseas.
'In spite of the current difficult economic circumstances, the 1992 Year
Book shows good growth by the UK book industry during the past 10 years,
particularly in the consumer market,' the association says.
The main exception is the school textbook market, which has suffered through
cuts in public spending and declining school population.
In 1991, consumer books accounted for Pounds 1.56bn in the UK, schools
Pounds 165m, academic/professional Pounds 505m, with imports totalling
Pounds 290m.
The most recent figures show Britons bought more books per head of
population than the French or the Dutch but fewer than either Germans or
Americans.
Overall, book prices from 1985-91 rose generally level with the cost of
living, but the report concedes that the figures may hide a tendency for the
price of new hardback fiction and mass market paperbacks to rise faster than
the cost of living.
The number of titles published has risen from 46,215 in 1981 to 68,348 in
1991.
Over the past five years, the financial performance of the industry appears
to have deteriorated, with the return on capital employed declining from 21
per cent in 1985 to 11.4 per cent in 1990-91. Precise comparisons are
difficult, however, because industry restructurings led to revaluations of
capital employed.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Lecturers win rights claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government conceded in the High Court yesterday that 60,000 lecturers in
further education colleges are covered by a European directive intended to
safeguard workers' employment conditions after takeovers. Mr John Patten,
education secretary, was ordered to pay costs estimated at Pounds 25,000
incurred by the Natfhe lecturers' union.
By meeting the lecturers' claim before legal argument began in a case
brought by Natfhe, the government limited its concession to them and
forestalled the possibility of a general judgment by the court that would
have favoured many more workers.
The lecturers will retain their current collectively negotiated pay and
conditions of employment, which had been threatened because the colleges are
due next year to be removed from council control and become independent
corporations.
Mr Patten accepted a court declaration that EC rules would cover college
lecturers after the change of status.
Natfhe said UK law breached EC rules on employment protection because it did
not require employers to honour the employment contracts they inherited when
acquiring non-profit-making organisations. Contracts must be honoured when
one organisation takes over another in the private sector, and Natfhe argued
that the rules should protect all workers.
The move does not mean that the government has conceded that UK law was in
breach of the directive.
Natfhe called the court's declaration 'a historic victory'. The Polytechnics
and Colleges Employers' Forum said: 'This will push up the unit costs of
most colleges and is likely to increase the prospects of redundancy for
further education lecturers.'

FT  06 OCT 92 / Heritage ministry warns on TV deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Heritage Department has warned the Office of Fair Trading
against taking too purist a view of competition in the television industry.
The department, which is responsible for broadcasting, said: 'For viewers,
competition is not an end in itself; a range of quality viewing is.'
It was responding to an OFT consultative paper on the future ITV network
system.
The OFT has made clear that it regards as matters for review ITV plans to
buy rights to programmes made by independent producers for 15 years, and the
degree of direct access for independents to the central network director,
responsible for ITV commissioning and scheduling.
Under the 1990 Broadcasting Act, the OFT must ensure that ITV networking
arrangements are fair.
The heritage department emphasises that the government's broadcasting policy
'includes, but is not driven by, the need to ensure fair competition across
the broadcasting industry'.
The submission argues that it would not be in viewers' interests for the
networking arrangements 'to be the tool which emasculated the ITV companies
in the name of competition'.
On programme rights, the department warns of the experience in foreign
markets where derivative channels based on repeats can suck out advertising
revenue without adding to the production base.
It is also concerned that the Independent Television Commission should be
clearly able to use its powers and that the individual ITV companies should
be accountable for what is broadcast.
The submission to the OFT also points out the importance of maintaining
healthy regional production centres, especially in the independent sector.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Abolish top police ranks, say councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR POLICE ranks should be abolished and replaced with flexible local
management structures, councils argue in radical proposals submitted to the
government's inquiry into policing yesterday.
They propose that all ranks between sergeant and chief constable should be
replaced with functional titles such as manager and commander.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, is awaiting the results of the inquiry
headed by Sir Patrick Sheehy into police rewards and responsibilities next
spring before deciding on ways of restructuring the service.
The council associations' evidence is important because their members form
the police committees responsible for overseeing the service.
They say: 'The very existence of clear and detailed national rank and pay
structures may effectively discourage some local managers from thinking on a
clean-sheet basis about what organisation structure they actually need.'

FT  06 OCT 92 / Nurses urge pay body to stand firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIONS representing 600,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors yesterday
urged the review body that recommends their pay to assert its independence
and resist government pressure to recommend a low settlement.
Nurses' unions have asked the review body for an 8.7 per cent pay increase.
That is well above inflation and the increase in average earnings, which was
6 per cent in the year to July.
It also poses a direct challenge to the government's attempt to drive down
public-sector pay increases which, over the past year, have been larger than
those in the private sector. Average pay in the public sector has
outstripped average pay in the private sector for the first time since 1986.
Unions representing the nurses say the 8.7 per cent rise is necessary to
restore the value of nurses' earnings to 1988 levels. They have said that
while their pay has kept pace with inflation it has not kept pace with
increases in non-manual workers' pay.
Unions say failure to bring pay levels back to those of 1988 will restore
the image of nursing as a low-paid profession and lead to staff shortages.
'We do not believe the claim is pie in the sky,' said Mrs Judith Carter,
chairman of the staff side of the Nursing and Midwifery Staffs Negotiating
Council.
The government, in its evidence to the Review Body for Nursing Staff,
Midwives and Health Visitors, has called for 'an exceptionally modest
increase'. The review body will report to the government later this year and
the cabinet will decide early next year whether to accept its findings. Pay
review bodies recommend increases for about 30 per cent of public-sector
employees.
The government may find that if the review bodies recommend high settlements
it will have to take the unusual step of rejecting them, as it did earlier
this year with the Top Salaries Review Body.

<TEXT>
THE BATTLE over Sunday trading in England and Wales returned to the High
Court yesterday when four women shop assistants employed by B&amp;Q sued
Kirklees Council in West Yorkshire for lost wages resulting from the
enforced Sunday closure of the DIY chain's Dewsbury store over a four-month
period last year.
The case was adjourned until next month together with a renewed application
by Kirklees for injunctions preventing B&amp;Q and Comet, the retail chain, from
opening stores in its area on Sundays.
Mr Nicholas Davidson, counsel for B&amp;Q and Comet, said the length of the case
would depend on whether the European Court of Justice gave its long-awaited
judgment on the legality of the Sunday trading laws in the meantime.
The European court has been asked by the House of Lords to rule on whether
restrictions on Sunday trading in England and Wales under the 1950 Shops Act
clash with EC provisions on free trade.

MEMBERS of Congress have rarely been so eager to leave Washington and return
to their districts. But incumbent US legislators have also rarely been so
vulnerable to challenge. With both the Senate and the House of
Representatives now ready to recess, the congressmen are rushing home to
devote themselves to getting re-elected.
The congressional ranks have already been strikingly reduced by a string of
voluntary and involuntary departures. These include such familiar faces as
Senator Warren Rudman, co-author of the Gramm-Rudman legislation that tried
vainly to keep the budget deficit in check in the 1980s, and Representative
Dante Fascell, chairman of the House foreign affairs committee.
Next year's new Congress will see an unprecedented number of new faces
taking up residence on Capitol Hill.
Turnover always seemed likely to be high with the passing of an elderly
generation of lawmakers and with the 10-yearly redrawing of district
boundaries to take account of new census data.
Redistricting alone has been projected by some to cost the Democratic party
up to 40 seats from their 266-seat majority in the House. Besides faster
population growth in Republican party areas, and the likely undoing of some
of the more egregious gerrymanders of 1982, new court interpretations of the
Voting Rights Act compelled the creation of more districts with predominant
populations of ethic minorities.
This has resulted in the drawing of some overwhelmingly Democratic
districts, but left the Republicans stronger in many others by siphoning off
black voters who remain, for the most part, strongly Democratic.
Taking a heavier toll, however, has been a growing feeling of
disillusionment among the people at large.
Within Congress, this has been translated into the retirement of some young
and promising members. Outside, it has fed an anti-incumbent wave that has
brought the downfall in party primaries of established politicians like Sen
Alan Dixon of Illinois or Rep Beverly Byron of Maryland. The November 3
general election could sweep out many more.
The worst mark against incumbent members, in many parts of the country, has
been the House bank scandal.
Members who abused the lax overdraft privileges at the House's private bank
have faced fierce political attacks from their opponents, and even a handful
of overdrawn cheques has been enough to bring some members to defeat.
The plight of the incumbent was epitomised by Rep Stephen Solarz of New
York, for years one of the most important foreign policy voices in the
House. Forced by redistricting into a Hispanic majority district, Mr Solarz
struggled bravely to learn Spanish. Foreign policy expertise, however, does
not provide the same kind of armour as old-fashioned constituent service;
his impressive total of overdrawn cheques put paid to his hopes, and he was
duly defeated in a primary ballot last month.
President George Bush has tried to capitalise on anti-Congress sentiment by
urging voters that the best way of breaking the 'gridlock' in Washington
between his Republican administration and the Democratic-controlled
legislature is to elect a Republican majority.
Events have not, however, turned out all the Republicans' way. They, too,
have lost incumbents in the wake of the House bank scandal, including Rep
Vin Weber, an intellectual leader of the younger right wing of his party.
Many Republicans, too, have simply given up the struggle of being an
apparently permanent minority.
Perhaps most significantly, the Republicans' chances of reducing the
Democrats' majority in the Senate, which two years ago seemed at least fair,
have evaporated.
Unlike in the House, where members must stand for re-election every two
years, only a third of the 100 Senate seats are up for grabs each election
year (although the number has risen to 36 this time because of special
elections to fill the remaining terms of senators who have died or
resigned).
Nevertheless, at least four Senate seats currently held by Republicans are,
on the latest polling data, tipping the Democrats' way, and two more look
vulnerable. Only two seats held by the Democrats show the same
vulnerability. All told, the Democrats are now generally expected at worst
to hold their 57-to-43 Senate majority.
In the House, where the Democrats' 266 seats loom over the Republicans' 166,
Rep Vic Fazio, chairman of the Democratic congressional campaign committee,
says he expects a loss of between 20 and 35 seats, which would certainly not
be enough to threaten the Democratic majority.
On the other hand there is little prospect of the Democrats winning a
two-thirds majority in either house, the amount that would enable them on
their own to override presidential legislative vetoes.
If there is to be a change to break Washington's partisan gridlock, it seems
more likely to come in the White House. Yet, with deaths, retirements and
primary defeats, the House is assured of seeing at least 130 new members,
and the Senate nine.
With this turnover the new Congress could be ready for radical institutional
change and a fresh approach to working with the administration.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Unreal air pervades campaign: Insults fly as US election
candidates prepare to debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURREAL mood has descended on the US presidential election campaign, a
week before the three candidates meet in debate and a month before the
country votes, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
Perhaps the oddest intervention came from President George Bush on Sunday
night when he claimed in a television interview that Governor Bill Clinton,
the Democratic candidate, had actively supported the administration's
policies of offering agricultural and other credits to Pres-ident Saddam
Hussein of Iraq.
This was obviously intended to deflect growing criticism of Mr Bush's role
in courting the Iraqi dictator. It drew a blistering response from Mr
Clinton, who said that to ascribe any significance to a five-minute courtesy
call in 1986 with the then Iraqi ambassador to the United Nations showed how
'desperate and pathetic' the president had become.
Stranger still was a Newsweek magazine report yesterday that several pages
of Mr Clinton's passport records, held at the State Department, had
apparently gone missing. The FBI was said to be making inquiries.
In the unfathomable category comes the new Ross Perot campaign. The Texas
billionaire, like Mr Bush and Mr Clinton, is now almost permanently on the
talk show programmes and was due last night to air the first of his paid-for
half-hour expositions on national television.
Yesterday morning Mr Perot came close to accusing the Republican party of
character assassination. However, he denied he would come out in support of
Mr Clinton and spent most of an interview accusing the media of being part
of the establishment plot to discredit his candidacy.
Mr Bush's Sunday night performance on Larry King Live - on this occasion not
live but taped in advance at the White House - was not one of his best. He
seemed not to know what his party platform said on the subject of abortion
and, repeatedly pressed on the state of the economy, merely responded that
'things have been tough, but they haven't been that tough'. For the first
time Mr Bush said Mr Clinton's failure to serve in the military was a
disqualification from serving as president. His election, the president
said, would mean replacing the US eagle in the White House with 'a
chameleon'.
Mr Perot's entry into the presidential race pushes Mr Clinton to within six
of the 270 Electoral College votes he needs to win, according to a survey
released yesterday, Reuter adds.
The survey of 20,400 likely voters in all 50 states by the American Research
Group focused on the college - the government body that actually chooses the
US president - rather than the popular vote.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Markets remain wary of Brazil's economics team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S new government began work yesterday, faced with the task of
dispelling the financial markets' doubts over the calibre of its economics
team and policy direction.
Of the six ministers sworn in yesterday only one - Mr Fernando Henrique
Cardoso, the new foreign minister - is a name of any standing. The holder of
the important finance and economy portfolio, Mr Gustavo Krause, is a
little-known congressman from the north-eastern state of Pernambuco.
Friday's market reaction was hardly a boost for the country's sixth economy
minister in as many years. The main Sao Paulo index dropped 8 per cent on
his nomination and yesterday closed a further 7.5 per cent down.
In an attempt to calm the markets Mr Krause, who is a lawyer and tax
specialist, and Mr Paulo Haddad, the new planning minister, are taking every
opportunity to pledge support for the orthodox stabilisation programme of Mr
Marclio Marques Moreira, the former economy minister.
Nerves steadied a little with the team's pledge to maintain international
commitments, such as the recently negotiated termsheet with creditor banks
on Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.7bn) of commercial debt. Relief also greeted the
news that Mr Francisco Gros, the respected central bank governor, has agreed
to stay on, though not indefinitely.
But the hastily written profiles of Mr Krause being transmitted frantically
on fax machines around Brazil and international markets are doing little to
abate fears that President Itamar Franco may be throwing away the
opportunity offered by the enthusiastic reaction to last week's vote to
impeach ex-President Fernando Collor.
One foreign banker commented: 'Brazil is a specialist in lost chances.'
While other Latin American economies have internationally known and widely
published economists at their helm, the best-known written work by Mr
Krause, a former mayor of the north-eastern town of Recife, is his 'Ten
Commandments of Bohemianism' which hangs in bars all over the city and
advocates liquid refreshment. He is a superstitious man and practitioner of
Umbanda, a form of white magic derived from African religions.
Apparently untroubled by the negative reaction to his appointment as head of
the world's ninth largest economy, Mr Krause appeared on breakfast
television yesterday to reiterate there would be no shock plans.
Tight monetary policy would be maintained and big new government projects
prohibited.
To reduce inflation from current levels of 25 per cent a month he will focus
on dialogue to achieve pre-fixing of prices and salaries.
Mr Krause said yesterday 'a pact is fundamental - it's impossible to
administer this economy unilaterally'. He hopes to recoup some of the 25 per
cent real fall in tax receipts of the last two years by offering sector-wide
tax cuts in return for reduced evasion - an experiment carried out
successfully when he was finance secretary of the Pernambuco state
government.
A priority for Mr Krause is fiscal reform. He plans a two-step adjustment,
with emergency legislation to come into effect next year and a more complete
reform to be discussed with next September's planned constitutional
revision.
The real test for the new team will come with their stance on structural
reforms such as trade liberalisation and, in particular, privatisation,
which several members of the new cabinet and Mr Franco have spoken out
against in the past.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Latin American Capital Markets: Brasilia pledges full
support for debt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW Brazilian administration of Mr Itamar Franco has expressed its full
support for a Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.7bn) debt agreement with commercial
banks finalised last month, according to a senior commercial banker.
Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citicorp, told a Financial Times
conference that he had spoken yesterday to the new Brazilian finance
minister, Mr Gustavo Krause, who assured him the new administration would
'proceed rapidly' to present the agreement to the Brazilian Senate as soon
as a translation into Portuguese was completed.
The agreement should be forwarded to Brazil's commercial bank creditors
within the next four weeks, he said.
Mr Rhodes told the conference on Latin American Capital Markets he was also
informed the new government planned to continue a privatisation programme,
although no details were yet available.
He said he was optimistic the new government would command enough support in
Congress to push through the necessary fiscal reform, needed under a standby
loan agreement with the International Monetary Fund. He said this would
expedite the commercial bank debt agreement and would allow a final exchange
of instruments to take place no later than the end of the second quarter of
next year.
He said Dollars 7bn of bonds covering interest arrears in 1989 and 1990
should be issued by Brazil sometime in November.
In a generally positive conference on the outlook for Latin America, he and
other speakers told of how the challenge to Latin governments has shifted in
the 1990s from the debt-dominated difficulties of the 1980s. Mr Shahid
Husain, vice-president for Latin America and the Caribbean at the World
Bank, said: 'The problem in most Latin American countries now is not the
scarcity of capital. It is how best to channel capital into productive
uses.'
Although much had been done in adjusting economic and trade policies, some
of the bigger tasks of building institutions and changing habits lay ahead.
There was 'a pressing need for investment in education, health, urban
development and the environment'; large investments in infrastructure; and a
further strengthening of fiscal systems, in particular a reform of social
security systems.
He said he was concerned that growing protectionism in industrial countries
could have serious effects on new regional trading arrangements within Latin
America. 'If regional arrangements are not to degenerate into new protective
walls, industrial countries will have to reduce and ultimately demolish the
protective walls against Latin American products.'
He also advised governments not to get involved in the new flows of finance
now being directed into Latin America - estimated last year at Dollars 40bn
 -and they should not assume any significant part of the risk. 'These flows
are economic and sustainable only if they are based on the sharing of risks
between private borrowers and the private lenders and investors.'
Mr James Conrow, executive vice-president of the Inter-American Development
Bank, expressed a concern that 'the period of explosive growth and
extraordinary returns' on international investment in Latin America was now
largely in the past. Such risk re-ratings tended to be one-time phenomena.
With growing competition for international capital, investors would
scrutinise even more carefully returns from Latin America.
He said there were also worries about a lack of diversity among investors. A
great majority of investors were individuals - holders of a pool of
so-called flight capital estimated by the IADB to be about Dollars 190bn -
rather than investment institutions. There was a need now to attract
institutional investors, who were being discouraged by the memory of losses
during the 1980s and by equity and bond markets that were still very thin.
A high percentage of market capitalisation was concentrated in a few shares
on most Latin American exchanges. A great majority of shares was still
closely held among a small number of investors, with little information
available to outsiders. A related problem was the scarcity of capital in the
region committed to market-making.
'The existence of powerful economic groups which trade on insider
information, frequently with little regard for minority shareholders, does
not engender confidence,' he said.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Supreme Court to rule on Haiti refugee policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and AP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Supreme Court yesterday agreed to pass judgment on the legality of
the administration's policy of intercepting would-be Haitian refugees on the
high seas and returning them home, writes Jurek Martin.
A ruling will probably not be handed down before next year. Until then the
court's temporary nullification, issued in August, of an Appeal Court
decision overturning the policy will stand.
The Bush administration's contention is that its facilities at the naval
base in Guantanamo, Cuba, were being swamped by the tide of Haitian boat
people and defended its programme, saying it was trying to protect the lives
of Haitians who were attempting to make the journey in overloaded,
unseaworthy boats.
The administration also said the Haitians were trying to enter the US to
escape poverty, not political persecution. Only applications for asylum and
refugee status lodged at the US consulate at Port-au-Prince are being
processed.
In briefs filed with the Supreme Court yesterday, government lawyers
contended that the Appeal Court ruling 'intruded into a delicate area of
foreign policy'. Attorneys for the Haitian refugees argued that the policy
contravened both US and international law and rendered the US Coast Guard
'agents of a murderous dictatorship in Haiti'.
The Supreme Court yesterday rejected a claim that US reparations to
Japanese-Americans interned during the second world war unconstitutionally
denied payment to others because of their race, AP adds.
The court, without comment, refused to hear an appeal by a man who said he
was interned as a child with his German father but was excluded from the
1988 payment programme.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Fei Pang seeks to win hearts in Hong Kong: But legislators
suspect 'President Patten'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN tickets for the two public meetings that Mr Chris Patten will hold this
Thursday and Friday went on sale last week, all 2,700 seats were snapped up
in 30 minutes: Britain's 28th and presumably last governor of Hong Kong is
riding an unprecedented wave of popularity.
This is Mr Patten's week and tomorrow his day. At 2.30pm he rises as
president of Hong Kong's Legislative Council to outline his plans. Unlike
previous governors, who presented their administration's policies for the
year ahead, Mr Patten will lay bare his blueprint for the last five years of
British colonial rule.
His address is expected to cover changes to the structure of government, his
thoughts on the conduct of Hong Kong's 1995 elections (which he will then
have to negotiate with China), and his spending priorities in areas such as
education, health and the environment.
The latter will be presented under the rubric of 'sound finance' and the
continuation of low taxation. But, with his officials projecting an
accumulated budget surplus of more than HKDollars 70bn (Pounds 5.25bn) by
the end of British rule in June 1997, there is plenty of money for an
ambitious politician and the 'kinder, gentler 1990s'.
The speech will define his agenda but it will also be the document to which
reference will be made for the next five years. As one official observed:
'He's made a political decision, and he's the one who is going to have to
live with it, and get on with it.'
Television advertisements showing Mr Patten kissing babies, helping old
ladies across streets and generally meeting an adoring public have been
running for the past week. Hong Kong has been witnessing a political
campaign the like of which it has not seen in the past 150 years of British
rule, and it is just the beginning.
In the wake of tomorrow's address, Mr Patten has an appointment with
talk-back radio, and will face a television studio audience of political
commentators and invited guests and appear in the legislature to take
questions from members.
Mindful that he is also a political figure in Britain, BBC television and
radio slots have also been booked. In between, Mr Patten will telephone Lord
Howe - British foreign secretary during the Anglo-Chinese negotiations which
led to the 1984 Joint Declaration on the colony's future - and Lord Wilson,
his immediate predecessor in Hong Kong, to inform them of his plans.
His calculated attempt to go directly to the people has won short-term
favour with the locals, who seem genuinely to like the man they have dubbed
Fei Pang (Fat Patten). But it has put legislators off-side.
They see him as 'President Patten', trying to marginalise law-makers,
especially democratically elected ones. When that worry is added to some of
his rumoured plans for change, such as splitting the executive branch of
government from the legislature, then the concerns transcend mere pique.
'Mr Patten may be a decent man and capable of running a presidential style
of leadership openly, but what happens in 1997 if Beijing does not appoint a
Chinese equivalent of him?' asks one Hong Kong liberal politician. 'All
power will reside in the executive branch of government.'
Quite how China views Mr Patten's dash for popularity is unknown but,
because the Chinese always favour playing a long game, there is a sense in
Beijing's silence of 'give him enough rope and he will hang himself'.
What is known is that Beijing sees itself as the representative of the
people of Hong Kong, whom it refers to as 'compatriots'. The sight,
therefore, of the last British colonial governor presenting himself as the
representative of the Chinese in the colony is bound to rankle.
How Mr Patten plans to deal with China is indicated by the words he uses.
'Openness', 'frank', 'trust' and 'direct' are his stock words when talking
about the sort of relationship he wants with Beijing. Towards the end of
this month he goes to the Chinese capital for his first meeting with the
Chinese leaders.
A calculated risk was taken two weeks ago when Mr Douglas Hurd, the British
foreign secretary, briefed Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, in New York
on Mr Patten's plans for Hong Kong's constitutional development. So far, the
pro-Beijing press in the colony has not been used to ventilate and criticise
those proposals, a fact Mr Patten's advisers have found encouraging.
But, as Mr Patten knows, tomorrow afternoon's address to the Legislative
Council is just the beginning of a process. On Thursday morning he may well
find that both local legislators and Beijing oppose his plans. And that is
when Fei Pang will have to start running.

MOZAMBIQUE has asked foreign countries to pay most of the Dollars 80m
(Pounds 44.9m) it needs to pay for elections next year, western diplomats
said yesterday, Reuter reports from Maputo.
The government, which signed a peace agreement with right-wing rebels on
Sunday, gave the figure to the foreign diplomatic corps in Maputo last week
at a meeting chaired by the co-operation minister, Mr Jacinto Veloso.
The government told the diplomats it could cover only 5 per cent of the
estimated cost and was relying on foreign donors to provide the balance.
Among the most expensive items are road works - thousands of miles were made
unusable during the civil war - election materials, vehicles and the
salaries of election staff, the diplomats said.
About 15 parties are expected to contest the elections.
To overcome transport difficulties the authorities will need a large number
of four-wheel drive vehicles, trucks, helicopters, light aircraft and boats,
it said.
France welcomed the peace agreement yesterday and said it was ready to help
Mozambique 'emerge from its difficulties'.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Investment in Japan set to fall sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT in Japan will be cut severely over the next year and a half
according to a wide-ranging survey published by the Industrial Bank of Japan
which warns that this year's slide in corporate investment will gather
momentum in 1993.
The IBJ forecasts that corporate investment for this fiscal year, which ends
next March, will fall by 2.5 per cent from last year. But the decline will
accelerate in 1993 with a 5.4 per cent drop.
The severity of the downturn is highlighted by unprecedented cuts in
investment by non-manufacturing companies, excluding the electricity
utilities. Non-manufacturers expect to reduce investment by 1 per cent this
year and by 5.3 per cent next year.
The cuts will be deeper in manufacturing, with an 11.8 per cent reduction
this year followed by a 12.9 per cent fall in 1993, with some industries
such as chemicals, paper and pulp and electric machinery making cuts of more
than 20 per cent this year. Investment in the car industry is forecast to
fall by 10.5 per cent this year and 7 per cent next year.
The bank said the results of the August survey of investment intentions
among 3,536 of its corporate customers were the most pessimistic results for
August since the survey began in 1969.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, the vice minister for international affairs at the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry, underlined the intractability
of the downturn by warning that it could take manufacturers some time to
reduce their unsold inventories to acceptable levels.
The IBJ warned that high investment in the late 1980s, when manufacturing
investment increased by more than 20 per cent a year for three years, has
left several sectors with chronic overcapacity. As a result it would be
difficult for any industry, including cars and electronics, construction and
retailing, to act as the engine of an investment led recovery, the bank
warned.
Further falls in profits would worsen the investment outlook for 1993, the
bank warned.
The decline in investment, combined with the sluggish stock market and lower
bank lending, is encouraging a significant shift in how companies finance
their investment.
The share of investment funded from companies' own resources is forecast to
rise from 54.7 per cent last year to 65 per cent next year, while borrowing
will fall by 1 percentage point to 17.4 per cent and issues of new equity
will fall to 0.4 per cent.
The decline in the Japanese economy is taking a heavy toll on imports of
foreign cars, which fell by about 9 per cent in August compared with last
year, according to figures published yesterday by the Japan Automobile
Importers' Association.
Sales of US cars rose marginally to 2,866, thanks mainly to a surge in
imports of Honda cars from its US plants, while European imports fell from
7,839 in last August to 6,988 this year. Sales of Audis and Volkswagens are
still rising, while sales of BMW and Mercedes Benz cars are falling.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Conditions spelled out on overseas aid policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday set out a specific code which will guide
its huge overseas development aid programme, linking aid to a country's
record in promoting democracy, human rights and market economics.
The Foreign Ministry report on development aid policy is the furthest the
government has gone in detailing its revised policy. In the past aid was not
tied to overt political conditions.
Last year the ministry issued guidelines for aid policy partly in response
to criticisms from overseas that Japanese policy priorities were not clear.
The new code follows a similar switch in aid policy, led by Britain and the
US
The report said Japan would not continue to give aid to countries where
there was excessive military spending.
Japan's net assistance to developing countries rose by 31 per cent last year
to a record Dollars 25bn (Pounds 14bn), mainly because of a sharp rise in
aid to south east Asian countries.
The Ministry of Finance said the aid amounted to about 0.73 per cent of
Japanese gross national product. Official development assistance rose by
19.6 per cent to Dollars 11bn, while flows of private funds to developing
countries grew by 77.9 per cent to Dollars 11.1bn, mainly because of a rise
in export credits linked to a rise in Japanese direct investment in the
region.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Institutions in dock beside Bubble Lady: Robert Thomson on a
high-flying Japanese restaurateur who is now facing fraud and forgery
charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the 'Bubble Lady', Ms Nui Onoue, shuffled ashen-faced into the Osaka
district court yesterday, she hardly fitted the pre-trial publicity about
the mysterious, charismatic restaurateur who enticed bankers and brokers to
fund Y890bn (Pounds 4.2bn) in stock investments.
But the unfolding evidence, spiced by tales of stock certificates delivered
in shopping bags and of a leading broker stationing a senior employee at her
restaurant, painted her as a remarkable woman who thrived during a
remarkable period - Japan's era of financial and speculative excess.
Ms Onoue, 62, is on trial for fraud and forgery for having used as
collateral Y342bn in faked deposit certificates from Toyo Shinkin Bank,
which, coincidentally, was dissolved last week after having failed to
recover from the relationship with the lady with the financial bubble. She
admits fraud but not forgery.
It may be Ms Onoue facing the charges but it is Japan's leading financial
institutions which are in the dock. Yesterday was the turn of Mr Shigefumi
Hayata, manager of Yamaichi Securities corporate fund sales department in
Osaka when the country's leading individual stock investor was in full
flight, receiving regular investment tips from other-worldly advisers at
seances.
Mr Hayata told how he became broker-in-residence at one of her two
restaurants, personally dealing with the huge buy orders and checking, in
advance, whether there were sufficient shares available to satisfy her
interest in a chosen company.
At various times, she was the largest individual shareholder in two Japanese
banks and held significant stakes in a range of blue chips, including Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) and the Industrial Bank of Japan (IBJ).
'Madam was so charismatic. I didn't think anything could go wrong,' Mr
Hayata said. He was glad to be doing business with her as, at one stage
early last year, her still furious purchasing accounted for 90 per cent of
his department's stock commission revenue.
By that time, Tokyo stock prices were plunging to new lows and the desperate
Ms Onoue began pulling collateral out of one bank to raise funds at another.
Mr Hayata, sitting in the same room, overheard some of the conversations and
was aware of dealings with 'about 20 banks' including IBJ, Fuji Bank and a
financial company linked to the Matsushita Electric group.
The defence is attempting to prove that Ms Onoue was as much a victim of
Japan's financial system as she was guilty of fraud. So Mr Hayata was given
a tough grilling, and in future months executives at IBJ and other
institutions can look forward to the same scrutiny of their own activities
during the period from 1987 until last year.
The case, which began with preliminary hearings in January, is only now
gathering momentum, but, with the Japanese wheels of justice slow to turn,
it will take two to three years before judgment is delivered. At present,
the court - also hearing charges against two managers of related financial
institutions - is sitting for about four hours a month.
Mr Hayata agreed that he knew mortgage certificates and other collateral was
being shifted from 'bank A to bank B', though he said he was unsure whether
the original collateral was being replaced. The bubble lady, fearing that
she was close to exposure, had told bank A that the documents were needed by
her accountant and the bank apparently believed her.
'I knew madam was losing money on the stock investment but my impression was
that she had a huge amount of assets and could afford the losses,' Mr Hayata
said. 'If I tried to stop her from moving the collateral, madam would have
become very angry with me.'
During the hearing yesterday, Ms Onoue sat slumped forward in her seat,
occasionally nodding off during discussion of legal technicalities and
sometimes wiping her eyes with tissues. She is free on a Y700m bond and in
spite of her formal bankruptcy in June still had a car waiting for her
outside the courtroom.
Mr Hayata was asked whether his presence in her restaurant and the
appearance of a very close relationship between Yamaichi and the bubble lady
gave other financial institutions the impression that Ms Onoue was deserving
of both trust and funds.
'I don't think there was any influence from Yamaichi's role. I don't think
it gave madam any extra prestige,' he said.

<TEXT>
TROOPS and paramilitary police surrounded Zaire's parliament building with
tanks and armoured cars yesterday stepping up their defiance of reformist
Prime Minister Etienne Tshisekedi, Reuter reports from Kinshasa.
The soldiers and gendarmes, under the command of President Mobutu Sese Seko,
were apparently sent to protect a rebel session of Zaire's national
assembly, which was dissolved six weeks ago by a pro-democracy conference.
Witnesses said troops also surrounded the Finance Ministry and kept up their
guard at Zaire's central bank, where they took up positions at the weekend
to support its sacked governor.
Defiant members of the pro-Mobutu parliament had scheduled a meeting for
yesterday afternoon to draw up a definitive new constitution - a task the
conference is supposed to perform.
Conference proposals to change Zaire's name, flag and currency have enraged
Mr Mobutu, who has ruled the huge central African state with an iron hand
for 27 years.
He has refused to approve a transitional charter replacing the previous
constitution. The conference was forced to shelve the changes, which
symbolise rejection of Mr Mobutu's rule, but they have not been scrapped
outright.
Troops patrolled streets near the parliament building in Kinshasa's
up-market Gombe district, ready to stop possible protests against the
meeting.
The latest military challenge to Mr Tshisekedi started after the prime
minister sacked the central bank governor, Mr Nyemba Shabani, on Thursday,
accusing him of fuelling rampant inflation by flooding the black market with
newly-printed banknotes. Soldiers surrounded the bank to guarantee continued
access for Mr Nyemba, part of Mobutu's old-guard leadership.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Sultan of Brunei does not like being called the world's richest
individual. But with a fortune estimated at Dollars 37bn (Pounds 20.7bn), it
is hard to deny being among the wonderfully wealthy.
His Majesty Paduka Seri Baginda Sultan Haji Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzaddin
Waddaulah, Sultan and Yang Di-Pertuan of Brunei Darussalam, is celebrating
25 years as absolute monarch of this small but financially well endowed
state on the west coast of the island of Borneo.
Yesterday was the main event to mark the anniversary of the sultan's
'ascension' to the throne. The sultan also serves as prime minister and
defence minister. Government is very much a family affair. One brother is
minister of foreign affairs, another is finance minister.
Lavish is one word to describe the Sultan of Brunei's palace. Large is
another. A banqueting hall where 6,000 sat down to an anniversary meal
yesterday. A palace with 257 lavatories and a total of nearly 1,800 rooms.
Several sultans, princes and princesses, Asian heads of state and other
dignitaries watched the sultan ascend his throne. Tiaras were de rigueur.
Diamonds dazzled.
There have been no elections in Brunei for more than 30 years. A state of
emergency has been in force ever since British troops were brought in to put
down an uprising in 1962. Brunei only became fully independent in 1984.
The sultan, still only in his mid-40s, made a royal anniversary statement.
The present system of monarchical government had served Brunei well. There
would be no change. That means no elections and no political parties. Islam
would continue to be emphasised. The sultan would donate Dollars 1m of his
own money to help the Moslems in Bosnia.
One of the sultan's many Rolls Royces purred outside. The monarch was taken
a short distance and then off-loaded onto the royal chariot, a rather
unwieldly vehicle the length of a cricket pitch pulled and pushed by a small
army of courtiers.
The sultan is an ex-Sandhurst man. The guards slow-stepped in perfect
formation. The band played Malay music. It played 'Colonel Bogey'.
Cash from oil and gas has transformed Brunei. With a population of only
250,000 the country has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world.

<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S first general election since 1985 looked set to draw a turnout of
well over 80 per cent yesterday as voters thronged to polling stations in a
carnival-like atmosphere marked only by two small and gentle demonstrations
by Kuwait's new suffragettes.
A heavy police presence, including helicopter patrols, proved unduly
cautious as hundreds of Kuwait men lined up outside school halls to cast
their votes for the 50-seat National Assembly which will convene at the end
of this month.
The sole demonstrations, led by two groups of women, each no more than
100-strong, were a largely impromptu affair organised by a small coterie of
liberal and well-heeled Kuwaiti women seeking to press further their
campaign to win the vote by the next elections in 1996.
Sheikh Ahmed Hamoud al-Sabah, the interior minister, commented: 'They were
very nice protests, actually.'
Full results should be known by noon today and Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the
crown prince and prime minister, will tomorrow accept the formal resignation
of the present cabinet. Under the 1962 constitution, he must name a new
cabinet - which has been seen as an interim body since its appointment in
April 1991 - within two weeks of yesterday's poll.
Sheikh Hamoud al-Sabah, who was touring the polling stations, said in an
interview: 'There will be changes in the cabinet. Under the constitution
there must be at least one member from the new National Assembly.'
Opposition groups hope the prime minister will include more assembly members
in the next 16-member cabinet than hitherto and will be watching the prime
minister's appointments as the next true test of the government's democratic
resolve.
'The 15 days after the election will be more important than the 15 days
before,' said Mr Hamad al Jouan, an independent candidate and one of the
government's most active critics in the last parliament.

</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC will today begin a painful and potentially divisive internal debate
on the use of trade weapons, such as anti-dumping duties, quotas and
safeguard clauses, in the single market.
Foreign and trade ministers meeting in Luxembourg will for the first time
discuss controversial plans which would give the European Commission greater
power to push through 'commercial defence measures'. Some Brussels lawyers
believe the result could be the most significant trade policy revision since
the anti-dumping rule was adopted in 1968.
The plan's aim is simple: to streamline how the Commission and European
Court deal with trade complaints. But it has become linked to the wider
question of how to lift quotas imposed on non-EC countries by individual
member states. The network of quotas must be scrapped, or harmonised, if the
single market is to work properly after January 1 1993.
The issue could set trade liberals such as Britain and Germany against their
southern counterparts, such as Spain and Italy, worried that free
circulation of goods after 1992 might disarm EC trade policy. 'It's going to
be a tough debate,' one official said yesterday.
The Commission proposal follows a plea from the European Court of Justice,
overloaded with trade complaints. The court wants such complaints handled by
the lower Court of First Instance.
Brussels says such a move could add to time taken for imposing defensive
trade measures. Its proposal would give the Commission more initiative by
letting opponents block a Commission proposal only if they could muster a
qualified majority against it. Now, duties can be blocked by a minority of
countries.
'This isn't about increasing the Commission's powers, it's about overcoming
deadlocks in the trade policy area,' a Brussels official said. Today's
discussion is unlikely to be conclusive, as member states are deadlocked
over the proposal.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CUBAN government effort to lure foreign investors has suffered a setback
with Havana's decision to discontinue work on a nuclear power plant for
which it was getting technical and financial help from the former Soviet
Union.
Havana had repeatedly said the plant was able to provide adequate power for
new industrial and commercial ventures on the island, ending the energy
shortage which has crippled economic life.
Cuba's oil supplies have fallen sharply since the collapse of the Soviet
Union, its main source of petroleum products. President Fidel Castro has
said the decision to suspend work was temporary. Russia had been making
unacceptable demands on Cuba for support in completing the plant.
The differences, say diplomats, centred on Russia's decision that its
contribution should be on a commercial basis. The Cubans were uncertain
about access to fuel for the plant. It is unlikely any other country will
offer to complete the project.
With Cuba's domestic oil output at only 5 per cent of the 10m tonnes it
needs each year, Havana will be pressed to convince prospective investors
the island represents a viable business location without the power station.
The plant, at Jurugua in Cienfuegos Province, has been frequently delayed by
technical problems. It was based on four 417MW reactors, but was planned to
start with two reactors two years ago.
The decision to suspend construction is likely to be greeted with relief by
Cuba's Caribbean neighbours. Claims by defecting Cuban scientists that it
was unsafe had forced several Caribbean governments to raise questions about
the effect on the region of a nuclear accident in the wake of the disaster
at a similar plant in Chernobyl. The Cubans denied their plant was faulty
and invited foreign experts to examine it.

<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS in Gatt's Uruguay Round must move forward in their talks over
services, market access and agriculture 'in a parallel fashion', in a
last-ditch effort to conclude this month the most complicated multilateral
trade talks in history, Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, said
yesterday.
The task must be essentially completed in October if lawyers, working out
final details, are to get a finished text to the US Congress before a March
1 deadline, she added. It is at that point that the US executive branch
would lose its 'fast-track' negotiating mandate, which prevents Congress
tacking amendments on to a finished deal.
Mrs Hills and Mr Edward Madigan, US agriculture secretary, meet EC trade and
agriculture officials in Brussels next Saturday and Sunday in a final
attempt to achieve a breakthrough in the farm talks and settle a menacing
dispute over oilseeds.
Mrs Hills has repeatedly delayed retaliatory sanctions against the EC's
oilseeds regime, although it has been twice found illegal by a Gatt dispute
settlement panel. Retaliation, she said, would have 'an injurious effect on
US industry', but if no solution was found, she would have no choice but to
act.
A solution on oilseeds would most likely have to precede an agreement on the
round, but the settlement would also affect 'how Europe looks at its
agriculture programme', Mrs Hills said. 'They have to deal with oilseeds.
They know they do. They can fix oilseeds within the CAP (Common Agriculture
Policy) reform.'
One option was to cut subsidies to oilseeds producers. She hoped a
breakthrough on agriculture would come when the French, second-biggest
providers of services worldwide, realised the benefits they could gain, and
took the necessary steps on agriculture.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Food Agency yesterday cleared the way for imports of sushi prepared
overseas, letting Japanese restaurateurs take advantage of cheap foreign
rice prices, even though imports of rice alone are banned, AP reports from
Tokyo. The popular food (fish atop balls of vinegar-flavoured boiled rice)
will be classified as a processed fish product if the fish makes up over 20
per cent of the total weight of one piece of sushi, the agency said.
The decision came after the Finance Ministry classified sushi as a processed
fish product and decided to impose 10-20 per cent tariffs, depending on the
kind of topping. At issue was whether a piece of sushi is one unit, or
separate fish and rice components. Japan's food law bans almost all rice
imports, to keep its self-sufficiency in its staple food.
Seeking a ruling, Sushi Boy, a 44-restaurant chain based in Osaka, had
imported 1,000 frozen pieces of sushi as samples. Proposals at Gatt's
Uruguay Round would require Japan to lift its rice ban. Japan has rejected
the idea.

FT  06 OCT 92 / World Trade News: Brazilian export growth relieves the gloom
 -Industry, writes Christina Lamb, combats recession by concentrating on
sales abroad
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHENEVER Brazilian officials are asked tough questions about the country's
generally gloomy economic situation, they retaliate with trade figures. This
year's morale-boosting export performance is one of the few things
unaffected by the country's political crisis.
Despite recession in its main overseas markets, Brazil is expecting its
exports to reach Dollars 36bn-38bn this year, or 10 per cent up on the last
three years and second only to 1988. The surplus for the first eight months
was Dollars 10.185bn, or 18.6 per cent ahead of last year, and a full-year
total of Dollars 15bn is predicted. Last month's trade surplus of Dollars
1.41bn was 116.87 per cent up on 1991.
'There are two simple reasons for this,' says Mr Pedro Motta Veiga, director
of the Foreign Trade Foundation (FUNCEX), 'and those are recession at home
and a stable real exchange rate for the first time since 1988'.
Although part of this year's export performance is due to a bumper harvest,
the main push is coming from industry. Sixty per cent of Brazilian exports
are manufactured goods, and, as companies struggle to survive a third year
of recession and stagnant domestic sales, they are focusing increasingly
overseas.
Several industries such as textiles, capital goods and white goods are being
sustained by foreign sales. The textile industry, which is operating with 30
per cent idle capacity, expects exports to reach a record Dollars 1.6bn, or
a third up on last year.
The best example of the export drive is the auto industry, which has seen
exports January-to-July up 56.9 per cent on last year. Anfavea, the vehicle
manufacturer's association, predicts a record 300,000 overseas sales this
year.
The domestic recession means that imports have been falling, belying
manufacturers' fears that the tariff reduction programme begun in 1990 would
destroy the long-protected Brazilian industry. Imports still represent only
around 6 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) and this year are 2.79 per
cent down and decreasing: in August, they fell 24.43 per cent.
However, this has not stopped industrialists protesting against the next
round of tariff reductions due on October 1, which will bring down the
average from 21 per cent to 17 per cen, still the highest in Latin America.
The government insists that the timetable will be kept, pointing out that
Brazil is committed to meet targets laid down in the Mercosul arrangement to
establish a free trade zone by 1995 with neighbouring Argentina, Paraguay
and Uruguay.
Much of the increase in Brazilian exports is due to sales to Argentina,
which now buys 8.13 per cent, second only to the US, which absorbs almost a
fifth. While sales to the European Community, the largest bloc purchaser,
and the US remained stable for the first half and those to Asia dropped,
exports to Argentina increased 142 per cent.
Brazil has gone from years of a small deficit with Argentina to a surplus as
a result of the fewer regulations and lower tariffs of Mercosul (its
products receive a 61 per cent preferential import duty reduction) and the
overvalued peso.
The avalanche of Brazilian products taking advantage of the cruzeiro's
weakness against the peso is causing deep worry among Argentine
industrialists and provoking cries of dumping. Brazilian industry is
generally better equipped and structured than in Argentina and thus more
likely to benefit from Mercosul. However, both sides are eager to ease
tension, and Brazil is considering buying more wheat and oil from Argentina
to improve the balance.
Despite its belief that exports are essential for economic recovery, the
government is providing little in the way of incentives and has no
high-level co-ordinating body for trade.
Mr Motta Veiga says the lack of a government export policy is
'unjustifiable' and argues that 'every 10 per cent increase in exports is 1
per cent of GDP, which makes a huge difference in a country like this. It is
the difference between recession or not and millions of jobs.'

Mr Clinton had said more needed to be done to protect the environment,
workers and farmers and guard against unexpected import surges. He urged an
Environmental Protection Commission headed by Senator Al Gore, his
vice-president if elected, and a commission for worker standards and safety.
The speech was so unclear she was not sure 'where he comes out' because
'words seem to be strewn around to attract every view.'
There had been no 'glaring omission' on worker adjustment aid, because Mr
Bush had announced 'a Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.6bn) five-year programme for
workers displaced by the pact. She denied Mexican truckers could drive in
the US without meeting its safety standards, that foods with pesticide
residues would be allowed into the US, or that environmental safeguards were
insufficient.

FT  06 OCT 92 / The ERM and Maastricht: Market fearful of EC's weak
currencies - Political problems mean that there could be worse to come for
sterling and the lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW round of tension which hit the foreign exchange markets yesterday
indicates that the fundamental pressures on weak European currencies remain
intense.
Since September 14, there has been one general realignment of the ERM, three
devaluations, a spate of interest rate rises throughout Europe and two
meetings of EC finance ministers to try and restore order to the market. But
investors are still encouraged to buy D-Marks by high German interest rates
and uncertainty about the future of the Maastricht treaty on European union.
The pound and lira fell sharply against the D-Mark yesterday. Meanwhile, the
Bank of Spain intervened to support the peseta after it came close to its
ERM floor against the D-Mark and the Dutch central bank was forced to
intervene to support the Irish punt.
There were three factors triggering yesterday's crisis.
Investors fear that the differential between US and German short-term
interest rates is threatening to widen. German short-term rates are 6.5
points higher than those in the US, offering dealers a far higher return if
they invest in D-Marks. The flows between two of the world's main currencies
also drive the rest of the foreign exchange market.
On Friday, investors' hopes of a cut in German rates were dashed as the
Bundesbank left its Lombard rate unchanged.
However, investors believe there could be another cut in the US discount
rate when the Federal Reserve's Federal Open Markets Committee meets today.
The slowdown in the US economy was underlined by a poor set of US economic
indicators last week, and the dollar fell yesterday to DM1.3890, close to
its historic low of DM1.3860.
The market increasingly believes that there will be another realignment of
the ERM, with the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, the Irish punt and
the Danish krone moving downwards against the D-Mark.
Realignment rumours make it risky to hold the vulnerable currencies.
Conversely, the risk-reward ratio in selling them is small. A dealer who
sells a weak currency will make a profit, but there is little chance of
making a loss because these currencies are unlikely to appreciate noticeably
against the D-Mark.
The possibility of a realignment was raised by Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's
economy minister, who said at the weekend that a cut in German interest
rates accompanied by a general realignment could help to settle tensions.
The Irish are also under pressure to devalue. Sterling was yesterday trading
at Pounds 1.10 to the Irish punt. The Irish have long taken the view that it
is not in Ireland's interest for the punt to rise above Pounds 1.05 because
31 per cent of Ireland's exports go to the UK.
The French franc came under intense pressure yesterday, even though France's
economic fundamentals could make it a candidate for revaluation against the
D-Mark.
Investors believe the huge cost of defending the franc in recent weeks would
make another speculative attack more difficult to resist. The Bundesbank is
estimated to have spent around DM20bn (Pounds 8bn) in intervention to
support the franc, while France's foreign currency reserves are thought to
be close to exhaustion.
Investors are worried by the fundamental economic weakness of several
European countries, above all Italy and the UK. In recent years, investment
funds in the US and Europe bought the lira and sterling because they were
increasingly tied to the D-Mark, by a growing commitment to the ERM and
European Monetary Union. Their departure from the ERM has undermined that
confidence.
There are fears the Italian government will be unable to get its emergency
budget package through parliament and that a general strike could be called.
In the UK, devaluation has left the government without a clear economic
policy, while the UK prime minister may have difficulty getting a Maastricht
ratification bill through parliament.
A worrying feature of the sell-off of the lira and sterling is that it is
fundamental selling by investment institutions rather than short-term
selling by the banks.
Mr Avinash Persaud, currency economist at UBS Phillips and Drew in London,
said that US pension funds engaged in massive selling of sterling in the
run-up to its devaluation on September 16. 'We are now seeing a second wave
of institutional selling by European funds who are going through a process
of portfolio adjustment.'

THE Irish government is to announce support measures today for exporters who
have been badly hit by sterling's continuing slide, but Mr Albert Reynolds,
the prime minister, again ruled out devaluation, writes Tim Coone in Dublin.
Yesterday sterling fell to a new record low of Pounds 1.10 against the punt,
which prompted Mr Terry Hobdell, the chairman of the Irish Small Firms
Association (SFA), to say: 'It is a serious crisis, not just for exporters
but for manufacturers who face the problem of much cheaper imports from the
UK.'
He said the SFA was looking for a package of IPounds 150m-200m 'to
underwrite exporters and those facing competition from the UK'. The
government said IPounds 50m was to be made available, along with IPounds 25m
from EC structural funds.

BRITAIN yesterday proposed to its EC partners at a meeting of foreign
ministers a hard-sell campaign to recapture public support for the
Maastricht treaty.
The initiative was proposed in a letter from Mr John Major, the prime
minister and current EC president, to EC leaders last week.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign minister, said the aim was to allay
widespread public anxiety about the community.
The campaign would call for more openness in the Community's managing of its
affairs, minimum interference in individual states and promotion of the
community's benefits to EC citizens.
Despite general agreement on the importance of subsidiarity - whereby the
community will not intervene in matters which can be better handled by
member states - yesterday's meeting was divided about its application.
Smaller states expressed misgivings about German efforts to curtail, in the
name of subsidiarity, the sole right of the European Commission to draft
legislation. Under the German proposal - supported in principle by Britain -
the Commission would have to send legislative proposals in advance to
national capitals for 'screening'. While this would not amount to a national
veto, smaller states feared this could be the ultimate Anglo-German aim.
Ireland voiced concern that the German proposal would 'upset the
institutional balance of the EC', while Spain led a vigorous defence of the
Commission - the traditional protector of the smaller states.
Mr Bruce Millan, the British commissioner responsible for regional policy,
said he was not surprised that member states were having difficulty in
pinning down the issue of subsidiarity.
'I don't think it's a thing about which you can produce a nice neat formula
 -you've got to demonstrate it in practice,' he said last night.
'If you approach it (subsidiarity) on the basis that what you are doing is
important and you want the rest of the community to fall into line, then you
will not respect the principle: that applies both to individual
commissioners and to some of the member states,' the commissioner added.
Mr Millan said he thought there was a growing groundswell of discontent in
Brussels about the British presidency.
'I don't think there's any doubt that a lot of commissioners and a lot of
member states have been unhappy about the reluctance of the presidency to
move things forward, especially over Maastricht', Mr Millan said.
In his letter, Mr Major pledged to complete parliamentary ratification of
Maastricht 'before or immediately after Christmas' and he adopted a markedly
positive tone toward Europe after his government's public ambivalence in the
wake of the sterling crisis. He called for a political declaration at the EC
summit on October 16 to remove popular misunderstandings about Maastricht.
A senior EC official said: 'Britain has returned to the mainstream.'
Mr Major has retreated from earlier demands for reform of the exchange rate
mechanism. In his letter, however, he said it would not be 'credible' to
avoid all debate on the recent monetary crisis.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of Spain yesterday signalled its confidence in the peseta by
partially lifting exchange controls that it introduced last month and by
declining to raise interest rates.
The peseta rose from Pta70.5 (39p) to the D-Mark to Pta71.8 early yesterday
before stabilising at Pta71.5, clear of its Pta72.6 floor in the Exchange
Rate Mechanism (ERM).
The bank's decision to maintain its 13 per cent intervention rate at
yesterday's auction of certificates of deposit, failed to rally the markets.
By mid-morning the Madrid stock exchange had fallen 1.8 per cent to a new
low for the year. Exchange controls will remain in place on one- to
three-day swap operations with the peseta. Thus dealers selling pesetas
'short' will have to deposit (interest-free with the Bank of Spain for up to
a year), a sum equivalent to the day's transactions.
Some dealers believed that the measures were now more stringent than before
for those operating on the peseta's 'spot' market.
Restrictions were, however, lifted on all other currency operations. The
bank also lowered the obligatory deposit, proportional to the amount of
foreign currency held, that domestic institutions have to make with the Bank
of Spain.
'Before, we were damaging those who were legitimately covering their
currency investments and now we are simply focusing on the speculators,' a
spokesman for the bank said.
A bank circular said the controls, which had been introduced 12 days ago at
a time of strong speculation on ERM currencies, were now being eased because
'the foreign exchange environment has since evolved towards greater
stability'.

THE European Community should negotiate broad trade agreements with the
former Soviet republics, EC foreign ministers agreed yesterday. It will
begin with Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russian president, is to visit Brussels later this year to
discuss bilateral trade.
During the ministers' meeting in Luxembourg yesterday, Germany proposed a
future free trade area embracing the EC and Russia. Although a long-range
proposal, it met stiff opposition from Portugal and France. It reflects
Bonn's fears about instability in eastern Europe and its greater sense of
obligation towards helping countries on its eastern border compared to other
EC members.
Foreign ministers of Poland, Hungary, the Czech federation and Slovakia
yesterday presented a formal request to begin EC membership negotiations by
1996, with a view to entering the Community by the end of the century.
The so-called Visegrad trio submitted their proposal during the first
official meeting with EC foreign ministers in Luxembourg.
The EC response was non-committal. It has signed association agreements with
the three states as a step to future membership but the emphasis is much
more on political co-operation than on full membership of the EC with all
the commensurate economic benefits.
Although the Twelve are publicly committed to helping these former communist
countries they have been slow in offering trade concessions.

(Pounds 4.87bn) deficit, an increase of around NKr8bn over 1992, the Finance
Ministry added: 'The main task now is to lay the conditions for increased
employment on a permanent basis.'
Total spending will rise 5.4 per cent to NKr371.8bn, relying heavily on
North Sea revenues from oil and gas. Total income is forecast to rise 3.5
per cent to NKr322.6bn. Some price subsidies will be cut, saving NKr730m,
and the defence budget is to be trimmed by NKr480m.
GDP growth is expected to slow to 1.5 per cent next year from 2.5 per cent
in 1992. The current account surplus is estimated to rise to NKr17.5bn.

FT  06 OCT 92 / The small wars are a big problem for Russia: Asian conflicts
continue to widen in significance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SMALL wars around Russia's perimeters are growing and acquiring an
increasing geo-political significance. All three of the Trans-Caucasian
republics on Russia's southern border - Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia -
are engaged in ethnic conflict. In Tajikistan, rival groups continue their
bloody battle for control.
Russian troops are embroiled on all sides in conflicts which are creating
thousands of refugee families living in squalid misery, usually in the
states' capitals, and which are leaching away already vastly depleted
reserves.
The Caucasian and Tajik crises are to top the agenda at a meeting on Friday
of the heads of state of the Commonwealth of Independent States in the
Kyrgyz capital of Bishkek. Discussions have already begun on sending in
peacekeeping forces to all of them.
But there a desire within the CIS not to internationalise the conflict.
Georgia and Tajikistan do not want the involvement of Russian or other CIS
forces. Russia does not want the involvement of the United Nations. Yet the
scope for internal pacification narrows as the internal chaos increasingly
grows.
The Georgian leader, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, is having a terrible time. At
the weekend, he again threatened to resign following a visit to the
separatist region of Abkhazia, in north-western Georgia. His forces were
last week thrown out of the town of Gagra, where they had been engaged in
fierce clashes with irregulars fighting for autonomy. He has promised to get
the town back, but reports yesterday suggested it was securely in Abkhazian
hands.
Mr Shevardnadze has been forced into making anti-Russian noises, threatening
to take over the arms of the Russian troops still deployed in his republic.
That in turn caused the Russian defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, to
warn on Saturday that any attempt to seize weapons would be forcefully
resisted.
Russian influence in the Caucasus is waning fast. Russia can either let its
southern Caucasian republics go or assert its power by force. There are
proponents of both views in the Russian government and parliament, with the
latter one prevailing.
Meanwhile, the war in Abkhazia has become, in the past two weeks, even
bloodier than the still-running conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis
in Nagorno Karabakh. Where, in the case of Nagorno Karabakh, the
Christian-Moslem antagonism is clear in the desecration of each other's holy
places, so the same malign energy begins to be evident in the
Georgian/Caucasian conflict.
The Abkhazian rebels are supported by the Confederation of Mountain Peoples,
which ended a conference in the largely Moslem republic of Chechen
Ingushetia over the weekend with a rousing denunciation of Russia from
General Dzhokar Dudayev, the republic's president.
He called Moscow the 'source of all evil' and proposed that 'unless we
become masters of the Caucasus now, we may share the plight of the Moslems
of Bosnia.' There have been demonstrations in neighbouring
Kabardino-Balkaria, agitating for a Moslem-dominated Caucasian federation.
In Tajikistan, the new government in Dushanbe under acting President
Akbarsho Iskandarov is faced with a sustained challenge from forces loyal to
the ousted, former Communist President Rakhmon Nabiyev. His troops have
waded into the southern town of Kurgan-Tyube through the blood of hundreds
of its inhabitants. The new government is more pro-Moslem than the old,
though it is still largely composed of former Communist officials
manouevring for position.
Islamic parties, both moderate and radical, are increasing in influence in
both Tajikistan and neighbouring Uzbekistan: however, the lines of struggle
are complex, with rival groups taking different sides. Mr Nabiyev's
supporters are probably being helped by Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader
of the Islamic Party of Afghanistan. According to Mr Davlat Khudonazarov, a
rival of the former president, Mr Hekmatyar is meddling in Tajik affairs in
order to promote Uzbek-Tajik rivalry and thus extend his own influence over
the area.
The hapless Russians are again trapped in the fighting - on guard on the
Tajik-Afghan border, deployed round the main hydro-electric station and as
ordinary citizens living and working in the republic. Here, as elsewhere,
they have no secure allies left in power and can only appeal to the feeble
structures of the CIS as an antidote to further atomisation and bloodshed.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Germans agree plan on health reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S pharmaceutical industry, doctors and dentists yesterday joined
forces in opposition to a new health service reform plan, which places the
brunt of sweeping subsidy cuts on their own costs.
The compromise plan was thrashed out during four days of talks among health
specialists from the three parties in the ruling coalition, and from the
opposition Social Democrats, chaired by Mr Horst Seehofer, the health
minister.
The plan requires the pharmaceutical industry and the medical profession to
pay for more than DM10bn (Pounds 4bn) out of a total DM11.4bn in reduced
subsidies for health care from the state budget, with the balance being
borne by patients.
Given the cross-party support for the plan, it now seems certain to win
parliamentary approval, but it is still likely to face fierce opposition
from the drug manufacturers, doctors and dentists, some of whom have already
staged token strikes.
Dr Karsten Vilmar, president of the federal general medical council, said
patients would inevitably be the losers from the savings plan. Savings of
more than DM11bn would only be possible if medical services were cut by that
amount, he said.
He called for value added tax on medicines to be halved to help cut costs.
He also sharply criticised a proposal to place a strict ceiling on the
number of doctors who can register with the state subsidised medical
insurance schemes.
The German pharmaceutical industry association (BPI) said the compromise
package represented a 'missed opportunity' for a more comprehensive reform
of the health system'.
Apart from strict measures to control drug prescriptions, the plan calls for
a real 5 per cent cut in prices of medicines, and a two-year price freeze.
A key criticism by the industry is that the limit on drug prescriptions
would worsen the treatment of patients, and threaten the existence of some
pharmaceutical makers.
'The pharmaceutical industry refuses to be called to account for possible
excess spending on medicines,' the BPI said.
In spite of the hostile reaction, a clearly delighted Mr Seehofer insisted
that the hard-won political compromise was both 'effective and fair'. It
will be presented to parliament and should be law before the end of the
year.

FT  06 OCT 92 / El Al claims may promptinsurers to boost rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The El Al crash will leave insurers with multi-million dollar insurance
claims. Coming hard on the heels of last week's loss of a Pakistan
International Airlines A-300, expected claims of more than Dollars 62m
(Pounds 34.8m) will add to pressure for increases in insurance premiums paid
by airlines.
El Al's insurance is led by syndicate 48 at Lloyd's of London. Lloyd's said
yesterday that 50 per cent of the claim would be met by Lloyd's and London
market insurers, with local Israeli companies picking up a portion of the
remainder.
Alexander Howden, the brokers who handle the account, confirmed that the
hull was insured for Dollars 62m. The aircraft was carrying between 110 and
120 tonnes of cargo although an international convention (which limits
compensation to Dollars 20 per kg) will restrict the size of any potential
payout to about Pounds 2.3m.
Claims due to the death of three crew and one passenger are limited by
international convention. The greatest area of uncertainty surrounds
personal injury awards to the relatives of the more than 250 people feared
killed on the ground.
Dutch courts do not make awards in compensation for bereavement or for any
'pain and suffering'.
Compensation awards could be higher if victims are able to take their
complaints to US courts.
Potential targets for litigation could be Boeing, the manufacturer of the
aircraft, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the US engine manufacturer.
Claims could well have an impact on the international aviation insurance
market. According to Mr William Barham of the brokers Willis Corroon, over
three quarters of the world's airlines renew their annual policies in
October and November and a number are currently negotiating renewal terms.
'It is conceivable that those insurers who haven't already negotiated terms
may seek to increase rates,' said Mr Barham.
Underwriters imposed sharp increases in rates last autumn but this year
overcapacity and competition between insurers has limited the size of
increases.
Willis reported last month that 'early renewals show hull rates as before or
only slightly increased with liabilities receiving token increases of less
than 10 per cent.'
Hugh Carnegy adds from Jerusalem: The crash was the first disaster of its
kind to hit El Al. The aircraft which crashed was one of two dedicated cargo
aircraft operated by El Al, both Boeing 747s.
The airline has not previously suffered any serious accident through
mechanical failure and stringent security measures on both passenger and
cargo flights have hitherto prevented any mid-air sabotage. It is understood
to spend Dollars 30m-Dollars 40m a year on security.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEOPLE of Sarajevo could face famine on the scale of Somalia this winter
if the relief effort is not greatly expanded, the World Health Organisation
warned yesterday. Sir Donald Acheson, WHO special representative for the
former Yugoslavia, said that unless 240 tons of food went into the besieged
Bosnian capital every day from now on, 'children will begin to die of
starvation in about four weeks' time, adults about four weeks later, and in
January we might expect to see pictures in one of the capitals of Europe
which we have become familiar with in the Horn of Africa.' Warehouses were
empty in Sarajevo, where 380,000 people are trapped.
The humanitarian airlift, which resumed on Saturday after a four-week
suspension, is being curtailed by short daylight hours and bad weather. At
its peak, however, it carried no more than 220 tons of food a day.
His warning came on a day of fierce fighting in which more than a dozen
people were killed. Fires ignited by incendiary shells from Serb guns blazed
in the Moslem quarter of Hrasno during what its defenders called 'the worst
day of the war'. Flames whipped by winds swept three blocks of flats and two
office buildings in the district on the south bank of the Miljacka River
dividing the capital. The shelling started with an attack on the nearby
Holiday Inn. Three floors were set on fire by direct hits from tanks firing
incendiary shells.
Sir Donald said the numbers dying in Sarajevo this winter would depend on
the action taken by governments to deal with the emergency. But if the
population did not get more than a few tons of food a day for the next three
months, 'perhaps the majority' would starve to death. To get the required
amount of food into the city, the UN needed bigger transport aircraft, more
trucks, and opening of road and rail routes from the Croatian port of Ploce
via Mostar.
Last week the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said 400,000 people in
Bosnia-Hercegovina could die of hunger and cold in freezing winter
temperatures. About 300,000 displaced people in Bosnia have no shelter at
all, and hundreds of thousands more lack window coverings.
Lord Owen, the European Community mediator, said only a quick cessation of
hostilities in Sarajevo would prevent widespread starvation and deaths from
exposure.
He and the United Nations mediator, Mr Cyrus Vance, urged Mr Radovan
Karadvic, Bosnian Serb leader, not to jeopardise talks planned for today in
Sarajevo between military commanders from the warring factions. Mr Karadvic
has threatened to withdraw from the peace process if the UN Security Council
imposes a 'no-fly' zone over Bosnia.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Aviation experts suspect mechanical problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MECHANICAL or structural problem appears to have been the most likely
cause of the El Al crash, although the possibility of sabotage has not been
entirely ruled out.
European civil aviation safety officials said that aircraft accidents on
take-off tended to be mechanical, while landing accidents were quite often
caused by pilot error.
The Boeing 747 freighter crashed after losing its two starboard engines soon
after take-off, when both caught fire.
Dutch civil aviation officials found the engines in a lake about nine miles
from the crash site. These, together with the aircraft's 'black box' flight
recorder, are expected to provide vital clues to the cause of the accident.
Boeing, the airframe manufacturer, and Pratt &amp; Whitney, the engine maker,
have both sent experts to Amsterdam to help Dutch officials and two teams of
investigators from Israel.
Experts suggest the most likely cause of the accident was an uncontained
explosion at take-off in one engine of the jumbo, which led to the failure
of the other engine. Another possibility is structural failure in an engine
mounting or pylon which could have ripped one of the fuel lines in the wing,
causing fire and damaging the second engine.
An identical Boeing 747 freighter, operated by China Airlines, crashed into
a mountain last December after take-off from Taipei, capital of Taiwan,
killing the crew of five.
Pilot error at Amsterdam was ruled out. 'With one engine out it would be
possible to make it back to the airport but with two on fire he would not
have had a cat in hell's chance,' said Mr Charles Darke, general secretary
of the British Airline Pilots Association.
The crash of a wide-body airliner in a densely populated area has long been
regarded as the aviation industry's nightmare. Anti-airport pressure groups
have repeatedly warned about the potential danger.

Russia's Defence Ministry denied responsibility and blamed Abkhazian

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADERS of the Commonwealth of Independent States will face crucial
decisions on the creation of a single monetary system and the development of
common economic policies within the remnants of the rouble zone when they
meet in Kyrgyzstan on Friday.
Foreign ministers of the states met in Moscow yesterday to draw up an
agenda. One key proposal comes from Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the president
of Kazakhstan.
Mr Nazarbayev has suggested a 'two-speed' CIS with common economic policies
for the inner core.
But this will leave the 'outer ring' states, especially Ukraine, with the
harsh choice of leaving the Commonwealth or delaying plans to introduce
their own currencies.
The Ukrainian delegation attended yesterday's meeting as observers,
reinforcing the likelihood of Ukraine being pushed at least to the edge of
the CIS, if not out of it entirely. The Russians and Ukrainians began
discussions in Kiev at the weekend on a procedure for the introduction of a
new Ukrainian currency.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, said after a meeting of CIS
foreign ministers in Moscow yesterday that 24 items were on the summit
agenda.
They included such military questions as the future of the Black Sea fleet,
now under joint Ukrainian-Russian jurisdiction, and the future of the
strategic missiles in four of the CIS member countries.
Mr Kozyrev said that the CIS 'would not be a mechanism for a civilised
divorce but an instrument for the further strengthening of joint action
between the states'.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the CIS armed forces, told the
official news agency Itar Tass last night that the two main military
problems were the various 'hot spots', especially Tajikistan, and the future
of the strategic forces.
He said that he was confident of the positions of Russia, Belarus and
Kazakhstan, but could not define the precise position of Ukraine, especially
since its change of government.
'We must hope that the position of Ukraine will be matched with the position
of the other three (nuclear) states of the CIS,' Marshal Shaposhnikov said.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Shares fall on economic worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Economics and Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES fell sharply in Europe and Japan yesterday amid fears that the
world's economic difficulties may be deepening.
Heavy selling was triggered by mounting worries about the lack of signs of a
recovery in the US and Japan and waning hopes of imminent cuts in German
interest rates.
The gloom was deepened by further selling pressure on some of the the weak
currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism, stoking expectations
that the ERM might soon require a further realignment.
Across continental Europe, share prices showed their biggest one-day drop
since the attempted coup in Moscow in August last year. In London, where
sentiment was also depressed by steep early falls on Wall Street, the stock
market fell by its largest amount in a single day since late 1987.
Paris and Frankfurt closed with losses of 4.3 per cent and 3.6 per cent on
the day; Stockholm fell more than 6 per cent.
Meanwhile, investors switched funds into D-Marks and out of several of the
weak European currencies and the dollar, on speculation that Germany is
unlikely to ease credit policy in the near future.
The dollar's weakness was intensified by the belief among some investors
that the US Federal Reserve may cut its short-term interest rates soon,
perhaps after today's meeting of its policy-making open markets committee.
Such a move could be expected to provide a stimulus to the flagging US
economy, which some believe is heading for a 'triple dip' recession.
In Europe, the French franc and the Spanish peseta came under renewed
pressure against the strong D-Mark, while there were large falls in both the
Italian lira and sterling, both of which are now floating outside the ERM.
The renewed currency turbulence added to expectations that the ERM, which in
recent weeks has suffered its greatest strains since its formation 13 years
ago, may require another realignment to allow for a devaluation of some weak
currencies against the D-Mark.
Yesterday's strains on financial markets started with a 222.57 fall in the
Nikkei index in Tokyo, where the stock market has been weak recently because
of worries about sluggish economic activity.
The fall in the Japanese index, which closed at 17,101.50, was one of the
factors depressing the confidence of investors in Europe and the US. Early
today the Nikkei was 146.94 lower at 16,964.56.
When trading on Wall Street opened, the Dow Jones Industrial Average quickly
fell more than 100 points. The share price slide in New York was prompted by
deepening concern about the economic outlook and disappointment that the Fed
had not cut interest rates after last Friday's poor employment figures for
September.
Later, however, US share prices recovered strongly as some investors gambled
on another interest rate cut and others bought stocks cheaply. The Dow
eventually closed at 3,179.00, down 21.61.
In Europe, the mood was set partly by Friday's decision by the Bundesbank
council to keep German interest rates unchanged.
The lira again fell victim to selling, dropping 5 per cent on the day
against the D-Mark and closing at L934.4 from L885.6. Another big fall was
suffered by the French franc, which closed at FFr3.3930 to the D-Mark from a
previous FFr3.3860.

FT  06 OCT 92 / No relief from gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DATA published yesterday on the real economy provided little relief from the
gloom which has been generated by the turmoil on the financial markets,
writes Emma Tucker.
The Building Employers Confederation angrily warned that another 50,000 jobs
in construction were likely to disappear by the end of the year.
Official figures added to the pessimism. The Central Statistical Office said
consumers made a net repayment of Pounds 30m in August on credit agreements
with finance houses, building societies and on certain credit cards,
compared with July's Pounds 78m increase in net borrowing  - dashing hopes
that consumer spending was reviving.
Figures from the Department of the Environment showed that private house
starts during the first eight months of the year fell by 7 per cent compared
with the same period a year ago.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Hanson launches Pounds 780m bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-American conglomerate, yesterday launched a hostile Pounds
780m cash bid for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the milling, baking and grocery
products group, in a move which could lead to a restructuring of the
industry.
The bid, the first sizeable hostile takeover in the UK stockmarket for some
months, comes at a time when profits in the UK milling and baking industry
are under severe pressure. Hanson said its managerial skills and financial
strengths could assist its restructuring.
Hanson's attack also revives questions about the acquisitive group's
strategy, which had appeared to change following criticism when it took a
2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries last year.
Lord Hanson, chairman of Hanson, offered to have 'amicable and constructive
discussions' with RHM. In a letter to Mr Stanley Metcalfe, chairman of RHM,
Lord Hanson said 'RHM seems to have lost its way forward since the time of
the bid in 1988 when you turned down 465p a share'.
Mr Metcalfe said he was surprised by the bid but was prepared to meet Lord
Hanson to discuss it. However, RHM said there was 'no commercial logic' in
the offer and that it 'seriously undervalues' the company.
After the 220p a share offer was announced, RHM shares rose to 241p, up 66p
yesterday. RHM shares had been firm in recent weeks as bid speculation
mounted, rising from 140p on September 4. Hanson shares fell 5 1/2 p to
202p.
In 1988 RHM survived a takeover bid at 465p and later rebuffed an approach
from a consortium led by Sir James Goldsmith, the financier. In January last
year Sir James sold a 28.5 per cent stake in RHM at 300p.
The group's profits have declined from a peak of Pounds 176.5m pre-tax in
1989 to Pounds 150.2m last year. Forecasts are for a further fall to under
Pounds 100m in the financial year which ended in August.
Mr Martin Taylor, vice-chairman of Hanson, said that the group had been
watching RHM for a long time, and in the last month had decided to explore
it further and bid. He said there was no particular trigger for the offer.
He denied that the move represented a reversion to 'old-style' Hanson
tactics, adding that the group's aim had always been to enhance value for
its own shareholders.
Hanson has net debt of about Pounds 1bn, but has substantial sterling cash
balances. RHM has net cash in its balance sheet.
Hanson is advised by N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, RHM by Morgan Grenfell.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Plunging markets test Major: Steep fall in equities Sterling
plumbs new depths Interest rate fears intensify
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night faced a crisis of confidence in London's financial
markets after a slump in share prices and a sliding pound raised intense
pressure for a clear statement of the government's economic strategy.
As the markets cast a shadow over the opening today of the Conservative
party conference, Mr Major responded to crumbling confidence by stressing
that low inflation remained the 'centrepiece' of his policy.
But share prices had already suffered their biggest one-day fall for five
years, prompting Lord Tebbit, a former Conservative party chairman, to warn
that Britain now faced 'an economic and political crisis'.
Arriving in Brighton, the prime minister told journalists that sterling,
which yesterday fell to another record low against the D-Mark, had been
caught in the much wider turbulence on financial markets across Europe. The
pound had been particularly hit only because it was one of the world's most
widely traded currencies. He added: 'These things happen from time to time.
. . .I don't think people should get unduly panicked about it.'
But as Mr Michael Heseltine's budget at the Department of Trade and Industry
emerged as the latest victim of Treasury spending cuts, Mr Major said he
would not shirk 'difficult choices' over public spending.
The economic gloom was deepened by a warning from the Building Employers'
Confederation of further big job losses.
Throwing a pall over what had already promised to be a fractious party
conference, the London stock market recorded its biggest one-day fall since
the 1987 crash. The FT-SE 100 share index lost 103.4 to 2,446.3, amid
concern about the apparent lack of direction to UK economic policy.
The policy vacuum saw the pound lose fall 3 3/4 pfennigs in London to
DM2.3925, bringing losses to 12 1/2 pfennigs in three trading days. It is
more than 55 pfennigs below its former ERM central rate of DM2.95. In New
York, the pound closed at DM2.43165.
But as sterling's weakness intensified concerns among senior Conservatives
that the government might soon be forced to raise interest rates, Mr Major
declined to anticipate Mr Norman Lamont's speech to the conference on
Thursday.
He told journalists: 'I am not going to pre-empt what the chancellor is to
say. But we have made it perfectly clear that the centrepiece of our
economic policy remains to get inflation low and to keep inflation low.'
Mr Lamont faces growing City pressure to use what was originally envisaged
as a general description of economic objectives to issue a more detailed
statement of how policy will operate outside the ERM.
Senior ministers were still stressing yesterday that the party conference
did not provide the right venue for a technical analysis of the operation of
monetary policy. But they acknowledged that unless Mr Lamont offered a clear
set of guidelines on Thursday, the markets might force a damaging rise in
interest rates.
Speaking at a private dinner for party officials last night, Mr Major
acknowledged that sterling's ignominious departure from the ERM had left his
gov-ernment under fire. But in what senior Tory officials characterised as a
'fighting speech', he indicated that he was ready to spell out the 'home
truths' on which economic policy would be based.
He sought also to pre-empt the threat of a damaging battle over Europe by
stressing from the outset of the conference that he would not be budged from
his support for the Maastricht treaty.
Confirming that the Maastricht bill would be brought back to the House of
Commons later this month, Mr Major said: 'I have no intention of going back
to Europe to break my word and the agreement I entered into.'
Sir Norman Fowler will attempt to reinforce the call for unity when the
conference opens this morning with a warning to delegates that the
Conservatives have built their election victories by eschewing public
divisions.
But leading Tory Eurosceptics signalled that they planned to use today's
debate on the government's European policy to demonstrate the strength of
opposition to Maastricht.

FT  06 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium transforms the
fortunes of a city - Kenneth Gooding looks at a smelter which may become one
of the world's biggest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jean-Marc Dion, mayor of Sept-Iles, remembers when his city, on the far
north shore of the St Lawrence River, was dying.
Once simply a trading outpost of the Hudson Bay Company, Sept-Iles boomed in
the 1950s when the Iron Ore Company of Canada started mining and processing
in the region. But in the 1980s its fortunes faded as the Iron Ore Company
cut back.
'People were coming into my office and saying they were desperate. They had
to leave because there were no jobs,' recalls Mr Dion, an energetic
69-year-old. He and the city's Industrial Commissioner, Mr Giles
Dechamplain, set off to Europe to drum up new business to keep their city
alive.
Those European visits paid handsome returns. Today, Sept-Iles is the
location of the Alouette aluminium smelter, which produced its first metal
in June and is destined to become one of the world's biggest. Many other
towns in Quebec, seemingly better-placed on the map because they were closer
to Quebec City or Montreal, were also desperate for new industrial
investment. The CDollars 1.4bn (Pounds 645m) project's construction - at the
peak 2,800 were employed - has helped Sept-Iles (population 27,000) to come
virtually unscathed through the recession so far.
For much of the time, Mr Dion worked in concert with Quebec officials,
particularly those from the Societe Generale de Financement (SGF), the
province's industrial agency. Quebec has an abundance of low-cost
hydro-electric power which can be distributed only relatively short
distances. However, it can be exported if 'stored' in aluminium. Producing
this metal consumes huge amounts of electricity - today's average-sized
aluminium smelter requires as much energy as a town with 500,000 inhabitants
 -so SGF has been encouraging more aluminium production to come to Quebec.
Nine European and US companies made their way to Sept-Iles to investigate.
Five formed a consortium to build the smelter. At that point, Mr Dion went
to his friend Mr Brian Mulroney, once president of the Iron Ore Company, but
now Canada's prime minister. He reminded Mr Mulroney of his promise to help,
as did SGF and the Quebec-owned power company, Hydro Quebec.
The Canadian government promised CDollars 90m to improve Sept-Iles harbour,
the second largest in Canada in terms of tonnages handled, and another
CDollars 14m for a car ferry to link the city with others on the St Lawrence
north shore.
The consortium got off to a bad start when Reynolds Metals, the
second-largest US aluminium group which was to have managed the project,
dropped out. In spring 1989, VAW Aluminium of Germany took Reynolds' place.
Although questions were raised about the group's lack of experience in
managing big international projects, the go-ahead for the smelter was given
in September 1989. The consortium's other members were SGF; Hoogovens of the
Netherlands; Austria Metall and a Japanese joint-venture between Kobe Steel
and Marubeni.
The project did indeed seem ill-fated because at the start of 1990 a big
pocket of clay was discovered on the 115-hectare site which which previously
was thought to be solid rock. Faced with extra expenditure, the consortium
made cuts to bring costs back within the previous budget. Positions of some
buildings were changed so that the car park now sits on the clay pocket but
the most important changes involved the cast house, which was simplified,
and the baking furnace, where a change was made to the technology from
Pechiney of France. This had a lower capital cost but cost more to operate.
Mr Otto Niederhofer, president of VAW Aluminium Canada, says some important
decisions had already been made when his company moved in to the consortium.
The smelter would use Pechiney's AP-30 technology (the same as the
state-owned group is using at its own new Dunkirk smelter in France) and
that Bechtel-SNC-Lavelin would do the construction work.
Eventually the smelter will employ 531. More than 10,000 people applied for
these relatively few jobs - an indication of the recession gripping Canada.
Most employees, who will earn about CDollars 40,000 a year, live in
Sept-Iles or the local region. Mr Niederhofer points out that winters in the
area are severe and living conditions are not easy, 'so it was important to
hire local people who are used to this'.
The consortium benefited from the recession by getting low prices on some
equipment and a trouble-free construction job when the St Lawrence north
shore previously had a reputation for labour disputes. There have been no
attempts to unionise the smelter.
The Alouette consortium is unusual because for tax reasons each of the five
partners owns 20 per cent of the smelter directly. They pay equal fees to
the smelter's management company, and to VAW, as the technical co-ordinator
and manager of the project, and to Pechiney for its technology.
Each must find buyers for its share of the aluminium produced and provide
its share of the alumina, the essential raw material. The partners can buy
alumina from whatever source suits them but they must swap it for material
from Gove in New South Wales, Australia, which is the only alumina used by
Alouette.
There was an extensive training programme from early on in the project to
ensure a smooth start-up - 127,000 man hours so far - which included sending
about 50 people for two to eight weeks' training at VAW's smelters in
Germany or to Pechiney's in France.
This effort seems to have paid off. Start-up was on schedule on June 1 and
has been uneventful. Mr Niederhofer says this is 'amazing' given the size of
the project, the number of people involved and the remoteness of the region.
Alouette will produce about 70,000 tonnes of aluminium this year and by the
end of December be running at its annual capacity rate of 215,000 tonnes.
The budget included most of the preparation work for a second phase to
double capacity. Mr Niederhofer says the partners are 'broadly in favour' of
the expansion but present low aluminium prices and uncertainties about
aluminium exports from Russia are holding up this decision.
Most of Alouette's metal will be absorbed by the partners' downstream
activities, mostly in Europe as it is cheaper to ship aluminium from the
smelter than to truck it to the US. However, SGF will retain some metal in
Quebec where it wants to encourage some aluminium fabricating businesses to
be set up.
The partners are silent on the key question of costs. About half the
smelter's costs are accounted for by electricity but they have signed a
confidentiality agreement which prevents them giving details of the 25-year
risk-and-profit-sharing contract with Hydro Quebec. This is linked to the
market price of aluminium but with a floor and ceiling.
The electricity contract also covers the second phase of the project and Mr
Niederhofer says the partners are under no immediate pressure because they
have until the end of 1994 to tell the power company whether they will go
ahead.
Of course, Mr Dion wants the the smelter to double capacity as quickly as
possible. Even in its first phase, Alouette will rank as the second-largest
contributor to his city's CDollars 31m annual budget. Mr Dion, a Liberal
Party member, is celebrating 20 years as mayor and the success of the
smelter project has reinforced his popularity. He comes up for re-election
in November next year and if he stands again the people of Sept-Iles will
almost certainly vote him back into office.

FT  06 OCT 92 / International Company News: SAS may rejoin bidding for
Continental
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAS, the European airline which has already written off a Dollars 106m
investment in the US's Continental Airlines, is considering rejoining the
current bidding for the bankrupt US carrier.
Yesterday afternoon, a press release issued in the US said that SAS had
joined the attempt by Houston Air, a Texas-based company owned by Mr Alfredo
Brener, to acquire a majority stake in Continental. This proposal, announced
in August, was one of five offers made to Continental over the past four
months.
Two other carriers - Northwest Airlines, the US airline, and Mexicana
Airlines, in which Mr Brener's family owns a sizeable stake - were said to
be participating in the revised bid, 'in an advisory capacity'. The release
said neither of these carriers would contribute any capital to the offer,
but made no such statement was made about SAS's role.
However, five minutes into a telephone press conference, Mr Jon Kutler from
Wasserstein Perella, the investment bank advising Houston Air, broke off to
take an external telephone call. He immediately halted the conference.
No explanation for the hiatus was forthcoming, but various parties suggested
that SAS had been acutely embarrassed by the release. The company acquired
18 per cent of Continental's voting rights in 1990, shortly before the
airline went into bankruptcy, and - despite writing off its investment -
still holds three board seats. The Continental board met yesterday in New
York, and Mr Jan Carlzon, the company's chief executive, was present.
Since company directors have fiduciary duty to all shareholders, SAS
representatives face a potential conflict of interest if the European
airline joins a bid for Continental. Nevertheless, in Stockholm SAS
maintained that there were no plans for its representatives to resign from
the Continental board, and that these directors had not been present at all
of the competing bidders' presentations.
SAS confirmed that it was talking to the Brener group. It declined to
comment on whether it would commit new funds to Continental.

FT  05 OCT 92 / People: Scotland's latest press baron
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland has a new newspaper tycoon. Ian Macpherson, who takes over the
chairmanship of Caledonian Newspaper Publishing this week, will head a
company which publishes The Herald, Scotland's leading quality daily, and
the Glasgow Evening Times, the UK's fifth largest evening paper.
The 56-year-old Macpherson, an accountant by training, is keen to play down
the idea that he will behave like a traditional newspaper proprietor. He
describes himself as a professional chairman and points out that since he
lives in St Andrews, 100 miles from Caledonian's Glasgow HQ, he will not be
continually popping in to host lunches and interfere in editorial
management.
Caledonian, a Pounds 74m management buy-out from Lonrho in May, has been
looking for a new chairman to take over from the veteran journalist Kenneth
Harris.
Liam Kane, Caledonia's chief executive, says that Caledonian's backers,
which include several well known Scottish financial institutions, were
looking for a 'financial exit' over the next three to five years and wanted
a chairman with good City connections.
Being a Scotsman clearly helped, but Macpherson describes himself as more a
'cousin' of Scotland's so-called 'financial mafia' than a fully-fledged
'brother'. He has spent a large part of his career south of the border after
qualifying with Peat Marwick and Dundee's Alliance Trust. He was a partner
of W Greenwell, the London stockbrokers, and opened Manufacturers Hanover
Trust's Scottish operation.
In 1979, he joined the British Linen Bank and rose to be deputy chief
executive. He is currently chairman and chief executive of Watson &amp; Philip,
Britain's third largest food distributor, and non-executive chairman of Low

London Stock Exchange.
Macpherson sees his role at Caledonian as making sure that it meets its
financial targets. However, the combination of the financial constraints of
the MBO and the recession are bound to result in 'stressful conditions' and
Macpherson sees an important part of his task as being a 'great encourager

Meanwhile, at the other end of the country, the fifth generation of a
provincial newspaper dynasty has started to appear. Kenelm Storey, 29, has
been appointed a non-executive director of Portsmouth and Sunderland
Newspapers which is headed by his father Sir Richard Storey. Kenelm, who is
general manager of The Guardian International, is the fifth generation of
the family to be involved in the business which was started by Samuel Storey
in 1873. Like his father, who joined the board at the age of 25, Kenelm is a
Wykehamist.

The top guard at Low &amp; Bonar is changing. Walter Telfer, 56, a former deputy
group chief executive and currently head of international operations, is
retiring at the end of December to pursue other personal and business
interests. He joined Low &amp; Bonar in 1975 and for the past two years has been
chairman of its North American packaging and plastics operations. His
departure will coincide with the retirement of Roland Jarvis, 59, chief
executive for the past eight years. Jim Leng, 46, chief executive of
European operations, will take over from Jarvis as group chief executive on
December 1.

Richard Stillwell, golf fanatic and chief executive of Imperial Chemical
Industries' paints operations in the Asia Pacific, is forsaking the delights
of Singapore's luscious golf courses for the watering holes of Brussels. He
is moving to Belgium as managing director of ICI's polyurethanes business,
part of ICI materials division.
The move follows Robb Margetts elevation to the main board of ICI from his
position as chief executive of the Tioxide group. Stillwell's predecessor at
polyurethanes, Alan Pedder, is promoted to Margetts' job. He is swapping
Brussels for Hammersmith, a less than exotic part of west London.
*****
David Carter, 40, general manager finance of ICI Specialties, has joined
ICI's eight-year-old corporate acquisitions team headed by 49-year-old John
Dewhurst.
Carter, who has worked on the financial side of ICI since joining in 1979,
is the fifth member of a small team which was set up by Sir Denys Henderson,
ICI's current chairman. Whereas many big companies use outside merchant
banks to vet potential acquisitions, ICI is of such a size that it can
justify its own in-house team.
The team advises the ICI board on acquisitions, mergers and divestments,
particularly on aspects such as scale, resources, merits and priorities.
Since it was established, the unit has examined over 2,000 companies and
been involved in 300 transactions.
Probably the best known of the executives who have passed through the ICI
acquisitions team is David Nash, Grand Metropolitan's current finance
director. After 12 years with ICI, Nash was appointed group finance director
of Cadbury Schweppes in 1987 before joining GrandMet in December 1989.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Workers' rights to be tested in court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHALLENGE to the government's interpretation of a European Community
directive on workers' employment rights after takeovers begins in the High
Court today.
Natfhe, the lecturers' union, says the law should be changed to prevent
organisations that acquire public-sector bodies from dismissing workers or
imposing inferior pay and conditions. The union says UK law breaches the
directive, as the law does not require employers to honour the employment
contracts they inherit when acquiring non-profit-making organisations.
Contracts must be honoured when one organisation takes over another in the
private sector, and Natfhe argues that the rules should protect all workers.
The government - under pressure from the European Commission - has agreed to
add an amendment to its planned employment bill, due in the next
parliamentary session, to extend equal protection to all workers. The
Commission is also preparing to take the British government to the European
Court of Justice.
Natfhe is continuing with the judicial review proceedings, which affect
50,000 lecturers in polytechnics, because Employment Department officials
are unable to announce the changes publicly before parliament debates them.
The lecturers will face new employers next year when polytechnics move out
of local-authority control in their switch to independent college
corporations.
The Local Government Management Board calculates that councils have lost
almost 20,000 jobs since 1987 as a result of compulsory competitive
tendering. A further 2,000 are expected to be removed from direct employment
by March next year Many workers have been re-hired by private contractors on
worse terms and conditions.
The EC Commission has argued for five years that the UK rules breach the
directive. Natfhe will also argue that employers must consult workers'
representatives before any transfer of ownership.

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: German insurance competition
hots up - The battle for market share ahead of deregulation in 1994
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When in March this year Germany's federal cartel authorities ruled that that
Allianz should scale down its 22.3 per cent stake in Dresdner Bank, the move
was seen as an attack at the very heart of the German financial and
industrial establishment.
Last week, the Bundeskartellamt backed down, saying there was no need for
Allianz - Europe's largest insurance group - to sell a single share in
Dresdner, the second biggest bank in Germany.
It was a dramatic U-turn, and it leaves the Allianz/Dresdner axis intact as
a powerful new force in German banking and insurance, its influence
consolidated through a network of shareholdings in large industrial
companies.
As the Berlin-based cartel authorities explicitly recognised in reversing
their earlier judgment, competition in the German insurance market - the
largest in Europe with premium-income of DM168bn (Pounds 67.2bn) last year -
is intensifying ahead of deregulation. A series of European Community
Directives, aimed at freeing up insurance markets, must be adopted by member
states by 1994.
Two large, financially strong companies have moved aggressively into the
German market in the last six months. One is Assurances Generales de France
(AGF), which has recently fought and won a complex battle to have full
voting rights accorded to its 25 per cent stake in Aachener und Munchener
Beteiligung, Germany's second largest insurance group.
The other is the Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank and rival to Allianz
as Germany's most powerful industrial/financial complex.
In July it bought a 30 per cent stake in Gerling-Konzern
Versicherungs-Beteiligungs, the biggest privately-owned insurance company in
Germany, with premium income of DM10bn. It followed this last month with the
purchase of a majority holding in Deutscher Herold Versicherungs, another
privately owned group.
The bank has said it will respect the wishes of the vendors and not disclose
any financial details. Speculation suggests that the bank paid between DM1bn
and DM1.5bn for the Gerling stake, and around DM500m for control of Herold.
Mr Georg Krupp, the Deutsche main board director responsible for the bank's
insurance activities, said that most of the press reports about the prices
paid had been wide of the mark - but declined to give any clue as to the
actual figure.
AGF's motivation for closer co-operation with Aachener is clear - it wants
to establish a bridgehead into the German market. From the point of view of
the German bank, Mr Kilmar Kopper, the Deutsche Bank chief executive,
explained last month that the Herold deal was a means of diversifying its
private client business. The 30 per cent stake in Gerling - predominantly an
industrial insurer - was a 'financial participation', not an excursion into
mainstream insurance.
Despite these innocuous explanations, the German press has been alive with
stories about an impending battle of the giants between Deutsche on the one
hand and Allianz/Dresdner on the other, a battle complicated by the fact
that Deutsche and Allianz both own 10 per cent stakes of each other.
From his eyrie towards the top of one of the Deutsche Bank twin towers in
the heart of Frankfurt's financial district, Mr Krupp dismisses talk of a
'battle of the giants'. 'It has never been our aim to build up an insurance
group,' he says, 'and it will not be in the future either. Our goal is not
to set ourselves up as a competitor to Allianz, but to serve our retail
customers better.'
Mr Krupp says that Deutsche Bank has long realised that in order to keep its
6.5m retail banking customers happy, it must offer more than straightforward
banking products. And in order to market its expanded product palette more
effectively, it must do more than operate its network of 1,500 bank
branches: it must open up new channels of distribution.
The first step in this strategy was to open up a housing finance subsidiary,
followed by the founding of a life insurance business in 1989. Mr Krupp says
that the recent acquisitions - especially the Herold purchase - have enabled
the strategy to be developed more quickly and cost-effectively than if the
bank had relied on organic growth alone. Herold brings the bank a tranche of
new life and other personal business, as well as access to new distribution
channels via a network of itinerant salesman.
By contrast, the purchase of the Gerling stake is less easy to explain. As a
pure financial investment, it makes little sense, analysts say - especially
at a time when Deutsche takes pains to stress that the assets locked up in
its other industrial holdings could better be deployed in the mainstream
banking business.
From an operational point of view, the synergies are small in relation to
the outlay. It is involved in life insurance and other personal sectors, but
the bulk of its business is with companies, not private individuals.
Some analysts worry that the acquisition of the 30 per cent stake could be a
stepping stone to a full purchase - 'worry', because Deutsche bankers do not
necessarily have the expertise to manage the business, and because the
company is said to need large injections of capital to make it fully
competitive over the longer term.
There is no clarification on this from Deutsche: asked whether the bank has
plans to buy the entire company Mr Krupp replies cryptically: 'Fantasy knows
no bounds.' Closer co-operation cannot be ruled out, he says.
One fantasy which may yet become a reality is that of Allianz/Dresdner and
Deutsche Bank battling it out in the liberalised insurance markets of the
mid-to-late 1990s.

<TEXT>
ITALGAS, the listed gas and water distribution group which is widely held
abroad, raised first-half gross operating profit by 9.9 per cent to L420bn
(Pounds 195.3m). Earnings before depreciation and tax rose by 13.4 per cent
to L398bn, boosted by a 31 per cent jump in interest and other financial
income.
Turnover rose by 5.7 per cent to L1,961bn, thanks to higher sales of natural
gas, in spite of a relatively mild winter. The figure was also boosted by
the expansion of the group's growing water distribution activities, with 45
new concessions in the first half of this year.
CIR, the industrial holding company controlled by Mr Carlo De Benedetti,
reported a first-half group loss of L18bn against net profits of L60.5bn in
the same period last year.
The plunge into the red stemmed from increased losses at Olivetti, the
computers group controlled by CIR, which was partly offset by strong profits
at the group's other industrial subsidiaries such as Valeo in France and
Sasib and Sogefi in Italy.
Earnings were additionally burdened by special provisions made by Banque
Dumenil Leble, CIR's French bank, and by a sharp fall in extraordinary
items, which amounted to L67bn in the first half of this year against L220bn
in the corresponding period last year.

QUEBECOR, North America's second biggest commercial printer, says it is
negotiating to buy three printing plants in France, including one formerly
owned by Maxwell Communication.
Mr Pierre Peladeau, Quebecor chairman whose holding company includes
Canada's second largest circulation daily newspaper, said the plants would
form a base for a big foray into European printing.
He said Quebecor had already made a bid for Imprimerie Cina Del Duca, of
Blois, a magazine printer with annual sales of around USDollars 150m (Pounds
87.2m). If the deal goes through, production at the Blois plant would be
rationalised.
Mr Peladeau said he is also looking at a UK printing business with a view to
a purchase. Quebecor acquired Maxwell Communication's US printing business
two years ago for USDollars 510m.
The company now operates 57 plants in North America, including Mexico.
Printing accounts for half the group's annual sales of around USDollars 2bn.
Inco is meeting union officials at its Sudbury and Thompson nickel mines and
processing plants today to announce cost-cutting moves to offset declining
metal prices.
The unions say Inco will cut the work week from five to four days, but
insisted they offered alternatives. Extended Christmas shutdowns are also
possible.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: Crossing frontiers - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The arts are certainly not afraid of Maastricht and an integrated Europe.
The first major pan-European arts sponsorship honeypot has just been
announced, with the money coming from Canadian owned Northern Telecom. For
the first year there will be three tranches of Pounds 50,000 available for
arts events in the UK, France and Germany which involve co-operation across
frontiers.
For example, if a British dance group commissions a work by a German
choreographer with a French composer providing the score, it could apply for
a grant towards the project, ranging from Pounds 5,000 up to Pounds 50,000,
with some confidence. Each year Northern Telecom will add a new European
country to its patronage so that in three years time it should be
distributing Pounds 250,000. It also hopes that its sister companies on the
continent will join the scheme, boosting the jackpot.
The sponsorship was devised by Cerec, the European Committee for Business,
Arts and Culture. The applications will be shifted by local committees of
worthies and then there will be an annual award ceremony. The chosen arts
events will promote innovation as well as international collaboration and
further information can be obtained from Spero Communications on 071 538
9946.
                        *      *      *
It is definitely getting hard out there. Companies are cutting back all
their peripheral expenses. And it is companies that were previously big
supporters of the arts - the banks, the insurance companies, the oil
multinationals - that are among the main sufferers in the recession.
The consensus is to freeze sponsorship budgets where possible. But if the
government cuts the arts budget for 1993-94 business will feel it is let off
the hook. This is an argument being put to the Treasury to maintain current
spending subsidy levels.
Few companies have so far risked the opprobrium of withdrawing from existing
sponsorships, but they are loathe to enter new commitments and are cutting
back in such areas as corporate membership, which can cost over Pounds
20,000 a year to guarantee seats at prestigious venues like Covent Garden.
The pressure is on to justify arts expenditure and to avoid links which look
like perks for the directors.
Sadler's Wells has adopted a flexible response to the crisis. It has come up
with a scheme to suit the times. For Pounds 1,000 you can become a member of
the Business Circle. As well as perks like free tickets and programmes the
participants are invited to bimonthly Business to Business meetings at the
theatre. The programme is aimed to appeal to local accountants, estate
agents, etc, who relish the chance to make business contacts in an arty
environment.
                        *      *      *
One major sponsor which has rationalised its programme is BP. Out goes its
support of the Arts Journalism of the Year Awards, which for six years were
held in co-operation with the Arts Council. The Council is now looking for a
new backer prepared to put up around Pounds 50,000 to promote the highest
possible standards in arts media coverage.
After a shaky start sponsors have come to the aid of the Council's 'Odd
Couple' conference at Brighton on October 27-29. The conference aims to
bring together workers in the arts and broadcasting to discuss areas of
conflict and co-operation, but the cost of over Pounds 300 a delegate
deterred many potential participants.
Philip Hedley of the Theatre Royal Stratford East expressed his horror at
the expense by offering to put up the money for a young artist to attend.
Harvey Goldsmith added his bursary. Now Carlton Communications is funding 70
full and half fee bursaries and Granada, Central and Sony are also helping.
The English National Opera is allowing itself a pat on the back for finding
sponsors for all seven of its new opera productions in the 1992-93 season
while its rival at Covent Garden has no commercial sponsors lined up. Not
that all is hunky dory at the Coliseum. It might have found sponsors for 14
of the operas on the programme but the revenue from this source is five per
cent down on a year ago. Sponsors are cutting back on the size of their
pledges.
ENO set itself an ambitious sponsorship target of Pounds 1.865m for 1992-93,
an 18 per cent increase on the previous year. To date it has raised Pounds
1.4m and is now finding the going tough. Two corporate prospects withdrew
their interest in Ken Russell's forthcoming production of Princess Ida,
although an American couple, Christine and Irvine Laidlaw, are making good
much of the gap.
Four operas this season are down to private sponsors and a fifth is backed
by thousands of individuals. To pay for a new production of Janacek's The
Adventures of Mr Broucek Pounds 50,000 has been raised in the past month
from the ENO's audience, who are encouraged after every performance to
contribute to its cost. A further encouragement is that BB Supply, UK
distributors of Gambrinus Pilsen Czech Beer, is testing arts sponsorship by
supplying several thousand bottles of beer to oil the Sponsor an Opera
campaign. By the end of October the ENO hopes that Pounds 100,000 will have
been accumulated this way.
                        *      *      *
Sculpture is an art form that has failed to attract the sponsors its history
and importance merits. Now the Royal Society of British Sculptors is
sharpening up its act and has attracted a major backer. Nat West Life, the
newly formed life assurance subsidiary of the Bank, is supporting the
Natwest Life Commission, which is aimed at young sculptors at art schools.
The winning entry will stand outside the company's new Bristol headquarters.
There will be Pounds 5,000 cash prize for the successful sculptor, Pounds
2,000 for their college, and advice from a professional sculptor in the
erection of the work.
                        *      *      *
Alternative comedy is currently the popular sponsorship fix.
Rowntree is the latest company to join in, with its Polo Mint comedy award.
Twenty-one nominees are appearing at London venues over the next two months.
One will then be chosen as the winner and will carry off no money, just
prestige. Polo has to pay their modest appearance fees, which includes spots
on Kiss FM.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Private bank to be closed down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England announced last night that it is to wind up the
operations of Mount Banking Corporation, a privately owned London-based
bank.
The Bank said it had won court approval to put in provisional liquidators.
Mr Philip Wallace and Mr Timothy Hayward of KPMG Peat Marwick were sent in
yesterday.
'The basis of our petition was that there were just and equitable grounds
for winding up the bank,' the Bank of England said. It stressed that it 'did
not allege insolvency'.
Mount Banking Corporation had a total balance sheet value of Pounds 200m at
the end of March this year. Its 3,000 depositors, who have deposits of about
Pounds 160m, are mainly Asians resident in India and East Africa, and
according to the Bank it has only a few depositors in the UK.
The company has a subsidiary in the Cayman Islands and affiliated companies
in Kenya and India.
Mount Banking Corporation is only the second bank to be moved on by the Bank
since it closed Bank of Credit and Commerce International in July last year.
The other was National Guardian Mortgage in Surrey, put into administration
in March this year owing 1,000 depositors about Pounds 10m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAGREEMENTS among senior Conservatives about the harsh medicine needed to
survive the present economic turmoil surfaced yesterday. Lord Parkinson, who
served in the Thatcher cabinet, said the priority should be to restrain
interest rates rather than taxes to protect capital spending programmes.
'The last thing our economy needs at the moment is higher interest rates,'
he said on BBC radio. 'As part of getting interest rates down, giving the
economy a boost and maintaining the capital programmes in the public
expenditure programme, I would be prepared to see a levy of some kind that
would put up taxes.'
He spoke as senior ministers strove to dispel fears of tax increases. They
emphasised that control of public spending was even more important than
before for the government's anti-inflationary strategy.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, emphasised the need to bring stability
back to the pound's exchange rates.
Mr Clarke, who was joined in his efforts to calm money market nervousness
about economic policy by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
added that the aim was to get public expenditure under control so there
would be no need for tax increases.

GUYANA'S presidential election gets under way today, placing the future of
the country's major bauxite and sugar industries in the hands of the 385,000
registered voters, writes Canute James in Georgetown.
The two long-time rivals contesting the presidency hold opposing views on
the economy, particularly the divestment of state-owned economic
enterprises.
The People's National Congress, led by Mr Desmond Hoyte, the president, says
it will continue its four-year-old divestment programme which plans to sell
the economically important sugar industry.
Dr Cheddi Jagan, leader of the main opposition People's Progressive party,
has said the divestment of all state companies by the PNC administration
will be reviewed if he wins the election.
Dr Jagan says a PPP administration will have no obligation to any earlier
divestment agreements.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCHAL ASSOCIATES INC has won a contract for construction of a USDollars 450m
(Pounds 260m) performing arts centre, the Second National Theatre, in Tokyo.
The 741,000 sq ft five-storey building will include three separate theatres
with a total of 3,500 seats.
The largest theatre will feature a 1,900 seat auditorium for opera, similar
in scale and style to classic European opera houses.
Schal is constructing the building in a joint venture team headed by
Takenaka, one of Japan's leading construction services companies.
The arts centre is being built for the Japanese Ministry of Construction in
the Shinjuku area of Tokyo.
It is called the Second National Theatre because there is already an older
National Theatre building used exclusively for traditional Japanese
performing arts.
The project was one of a number identified in bilateral trade agreements
between the US and Japan as being open to foreign participation.
Schal was the first US construction company to win a public works project in
Japan under bilateral trade agreements and its current workload for Japanese
clients includes the west wing of the Tokyo Telelecom Centre.
Founded in 1976, Schal Associates is a world leader in construction services
and a subsidiary of New York-based Bovis Inc, the US construction arm of
P&amp;O.

virtual office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SOME companies are using the opportunity of contracting out services to
reduce what is offered, says Mr Keith Lawson, design director of the
Business Design Group.
Mr Lawson, who helps companies plan and run their office environments, says:
'Companies who contract-out space planning to us are starting to talk about
the virtual office and ask whether everyone needs their own desk.
'The answer is 'No.' People who are out of the office a lot don't need to
come back to the same workspace as long as they have access to office
services.
'They will live out of two briefcases - one containing work and the other
containing the things which personalise their desk, such as family photos.'
Dr Frank Duffy, chairman of DEGW, an architectural practice which
specialises in designing the working environment, says: 'With the
proliferation of information technology, the penny has dropped that you can
intensify space use. Many of our clients including IBM (UK), PA Consulting
and Arthur Andersen, have started to apply the concept of time-sharing to
office space.
'With imagination, one workspace, costing over Pounds 5,000 a year can be
used by three or even five people.'
The Responsible Workplace, a multi-client study produced by DEGW and the
Building Research Establishment, will be published by Butterworths in
February 1993.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (12): A more radical
approach - Facilities Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recession has widened the scope of facilities management. Today, more and
more companies are concentrating on their core businesses and placing other
services in the hands of outside contractors.
No longer is it just a question of whether to contract out catering,
security and office cleaning. Big companies are starting to hand over
responsibility for everything from accounting to personal computers to the
corporate network.
There is nothing new about contracting out projects and services to external
companies. But recently many companies have started to take a more radical
approach, often with assets and or staff being transferred to the service
company. This approach (often referred to as outsourcing) is being applied
to information technology (IT) and other functions, notably finance. For
example, BP Exploration (Europe) recently contracted out its accounting
function.
In the IT area, facilities management-outsourcing is growing at a compound
annual rate of 18.5 per cent in Europe, according to Mr Morgan David of the
International Data Corporation. IDC predicts that the European market will
be worth Dollars 4.9bn by 1996. Two associated benefits of facilities
management (FM) are that it can cut costs and increase business focus. J P
Morgan, the US bank, and US razor company Gillette, have both opted for a
new but fast-growing branch of facilities management - managed networks.
They have handed over the management of their international data networks to
BT in a move to cut the costs of their existing operations and streamline.
J P Morgan's five-year agreement, worth about Dollars 20m, is expected to
save the company Dollars 12.5m in operating expenses. Mr Rick Manser,
Gillette's communications manager, says that opting for a managed network
'gives Gillette the ability to continue to focus on our consumer product
lines rather than expending time, money and effort on international data
networking.'
FM is not only attractive to commercial companies. Public sector
organisations such as local authorities and government departments are also
turning to FM. For example, Berkshire County Council has contracted out its
printing to Kodak Facilities Management and cut costs by about 15 per cent.
Hertfordshire County Council, which saved money by contracting out its
computers and telecoms services last year, has just decided to contract out
the management and support of its PCs and local area networks. The Pounds
250,000-a-year PC FM deal includes the transfer of six PC support staff from
Hertfordshire County Council to UK company ITnet. They join the 45 staff
transferred under the earlier Pounds 2m-a-year FM deal.
Cost-savings are not the only benefits of opting for FM. Some companies
contract out services because they are not happy with the quality of
in-house equivalents, or because they want greater flexibility.
'Many opt for FM while they are transferring from one technology to
another,' says Mr Peter Falconer, associate director of computer services
company Hoskyns.
For example, UK retailer Mothercare contracted out its computers to Hoskyns,
while it was transferring from IBM mainframes to smaller IBM systems
(AS/400s). It needed to keep its old systems running while it was developing
software to run on the new machines.
But despite the benefits of FM, there are a number of risks:
Loss of ad hoc services: Judith Wainwright, a director of London-based
management consultants Pagoda, says: 'Most in-house functions provide a
range of valuable services to the business informally. For example, working
late to help solve business problems. Many of these may not be covered by an
outsourcing contract and are effectively withdrawn causing dissatisfaction
with service.'
High costs for extras: Although competitive tendering is likely to keep down
the costs of the contract, suppliers may use changing requirements as a way
of improving on margins. Extras not specified in the contract (such as extra
computer power) may work out very expensive.
Loss of in-house expertise: Once services have been contracted out, it may
be difficult to bring them back in-house. This is especially true of
computer services.
Many of the computer FM contracts in place have not run their full course,
so there are few documented examples of companies trying to staff and run a
computer centre again.
Loss of confidentiality: One of the most recent public sector organisations
to consider computer FM is the UK's Inland Revenue. It is talking to a
number of suppliers about the possibility of contracting out the computer
processing of tax returns.
However, critics of the proposal argue that information about taxpayers is
too sensitive to be handled by private-sector staff.
And some commercial companies resist FM (or restrict it to certain areas)
because they worry that confidential data will get into the wrong hands.
FM suppliers counter that their procedures are often stricter than those of
their clients.
Loss of competitive advantage: Before contracting out an activity, companies
should ask themselves how it affects their competitive strength in their
main markets. US researchers Frost &amp; Sullivan say those activities which are
unique to the company or based on company-specific skills provide
competitive advantage and should be kept in-house. But if an activity is
mature (such as printing or staff catering), outside suppliers can probably
manage it just as well and at lower cost.
Limited redress for poor service: Unless the level of service required by
the user company is spelt out in the contract, it may be difficult to get
redress for poor performance. Or the redress may be insufficient if a
crucial business function is affected.
One reason for outsourcing is a belief in market forces and healthy
competition. But Wainwright warns: 'Some companies take it to extremes and
encourage individual managers to replace internal work with external
contracts at will. This can lead to fragmentation, with many external
suppliers providing overlapping services, and failure to obtain the best
deal for the whole company.'

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (14): Work-related
illnesses - Ergonomics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICE staff have not traditionally expected to suffer serious, disabling
injuries at work in the way that construction workers often have.
Yet there is now overwhelming evidence that white-collar workers face
dangers when they sit at their desks. These dangers can have serious
implications for incautious employers who may face a flood of damages claims
or productivity setbacks as a result of high levels of absence.
A machine operator at Vauxhall Motors in Luton who contracted repetitive
strain injury (RSI) and had to give up her job was awarded a record Pounds
59,617 in damages and loss of earnings by a judge at Luton County Court
earlier this year.
A recent case involving BT keyboard operators granted damages of Pounds
6,000 but a loss of earnings award has not yet been decided. In another
case, GMB general union received Pounds 67,000 between them for loss of
earnings.
In 1989-90 more than 750,000 people took sickness absence because of
work-related illness, and some 8,000 lives and 27m working days in Europe
are lost each year due to work-related accidents and ill health, according
to the Health and Safety Executive. The HSE believes the problem is growing.
The visual display unit has invaded desk space and become virtually
ubiquitous in offices in the developed world. However, the revolution in
equipment was not matched with a revolution in working practices or office
furniture and it is small wonder that office workers have found their new
equipment created new problems.
The most well known and the biggest of the new maladies is musculo-skeletal
injury, in particular Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI), the painful, sometimes
disabling disorder that affects necks, shoulders, arms and hands.
In the US, RSI now accounts for more than half of all reported work-related
injuries. In the UK, it is a growing problem among white-collar workers
affecting professionals, secretarial staff, computer users and high-volume
data handlers.
RSI refers to a variety of complaints. Sufferers report symptoms ranging
from mild discomfort to severe, disabling pain which affects their personal
as well as their professional lives.
Some disorders, such as tenosynovitis and capsulitis are well understood by
the growing army of experts. Others are less easy to diagnose and tend to be
lumped together under vague headings such as damaged nerve tissue. None is
easy to cure.
But RSI is avoidable and employers who have made concerted efforts to
reorganise their office environments have seen dramatic decreases in its
incidence.
Employers who have ignored the risks to their staff will soon have an
additional reason to keep those risks to a minimum. By the end of this year
the UK must have domestic legislation which meets the requirements of a
European Community directive.
The legislation is highly specific. It refers to 'display screen equipment'
but excludes computer systems open to the public and automatic teller
machines in banks and building societies, as well as calculators,
typewriters and lap-top users not typically used for long periods.
The directive applies to the workstation as a whole, covering chairs, desks,
modems and printers. These references and a catch-all heading of the
'immediate work environment' means employers will have to think carefully
about the implications of all office environment.
It is not just the physical pieces of equipment which employers must ensure
comply with the directive; humidity, lighting, radiation and noise are all
addressed.
Employers will be obliged to conduct workplace evaluations to check they do
not present health risks to their staff. The directive specifies that screen
workers must be properly trained, allowed free eye testing and any necessary
glasses and that screen work must be interspersed with periods of activity
or breaks.
RSI is not the only risk to white-collar workers. There is the potentially
fatal building-related illness which covers legionnaires disease as well as
other dangerous bacteria which lurk in convenient recesses provided by
modern air conditioning systems and elsewhere.
Then there is sick building syndrome, less dangerous but more difficult to
tackle because it is hard to diagnose and no one really knows for sure what
causes it.
It can affect staff in ways which even they do not recognise immediately but
which can have a serious affect on both their health and the health of their
businesses. The World Health Organisation estimates the syndrome affects a
third of European and North American offices. The House of Commons
Environment Committee put the annual cost to the UK economy alone as between
Pounds 330m and more than Pounds 650m a year in absenteeism.
A wide variety of symptoms range from sore throats, dry eyes (some staff
have been unable to wear contact lenses), headaches and coughs through
exacerbated menstrual disorders to lethargy, dizziness and depression.
Sufferers typically report that their symptoms only show up when they are at
work and disappear as soon as they leave. Their close friends and families
appear to be immune.
The Health and Safety Executive takes a gloomy view. It recently concluded
that 20 years of research had failed to uncover any definite cure or cause
for the condition. The HSE is funding research at London University which is
comparing the sickness and absence data of more than 10,000 office-based
civil servants with measurements of environmental factors and building
maintenance work.
Evidence suggests that stress at work is also an important cause of sickness
absence. The HSE believes occupational stress could have an impact on
physical health.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (11): Fiercely
competitive market - Photocopiers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHOTOCOPYING may be one of the oldest office technologies, but it continues
to be one of the most fiercely competitive markets - and one of the most
contentious.
The past year has witnessed the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC)
investigation into toner supply; the Office of Fair Trading inquiry into
dodgy dealer copier contracts; and the European Commission debating, yet
again, the question of levies on imported Japanese copiers.
All the while sales were being squeezed. Market research company Dataquest
has yet to finalise its market figures for 1991 but, according to Jacqueline
Hendriks, copiers research analyst, 1991 UK copier placements decreased by
11 per cent compared with 1990 to 144,500 units.
The three main reasons for the decline were the impact of the recession,
which has restricted user spending; the shift in copier placements from low
to mid- and high-range machines; and the increased demand for less expensive
reconditioned/refurbished machines.
In terms of market share by unit placements, the top three suppliers last
year were Canon with 30 per cent, Rank Xerox with 18 per cent and Sharp with
9 per cent. Toshiba stands in fourth position followed by Mita in fifth.
Canon did well because of its strength in the colour market, while Rank
Xerox did well because of a significant increase in 91+cpm (copies per
minute) placements and because it receives revenues from its service
operation as well (a fact which the MMC found upset some of their dealers),
the report states.
Although Sharp has pulled back from its involvement in the colour copier
market until 1993, the company looks set to do better in future following
its entry into the higher volume market. According to Dataquest, Konica and
Minolta are showing good form in Segment 3 (31-44 cpm). But, as the MMC
concluded during its investigation, the most appropriate market share
measure of a copier company's current performance is placements weighted by
recommended monthly copy volume.
That meant, in 1989, that the Rank Xerox share was 31 per cent (down from 90
per cent in the heady pre-Japanese days of the mid-1970s), Canon had 7 per
cent, Kodak 7 per cent, Toshiba 6 per cent and Sharp 5 per cent. The MMC put
the total UK market value at Pounds 1bn.
Indal Business Research, which carried out the industry survey for the MMC,
puts the UK installed base at 717,000 copiers, with 179,000 machines
placements in 1989, nearly two thirds of which were replacement machines, of
which some 80 per cent were imported. There were 22 main suppliers selling
300 models between them and some 2,000 dealers; all combining to ensure that
no monopoly position in respect of machines, consumables, parts and service
operated against the public interest.
For Europe as a whole, BIS Strategic Decisions estimates that the monochrome
plain paper copier base will grow to 6.73m in 1995 units from the 5.65m
recorded for 1990.
The company forecasts a significant increase in the installed base of colour
copiers in Europe from 34,260 units in 1990 to 117,600 in 1995, with
electrophotographic technologies taking the lion's share of 28,580 and
99,300 units respectively.
Dataquest claims that almost 15,000 units were placed in Europe during 1991,
of which one fifth were in the UK. But of all the new full-colour copiers
launched over the past year, it says the Canon CLC10 bubblejet, a copier,
printer and scanner, is seen as the key to market take-off.
It would appear that whatever guise the copier is under, its usefulness will
not diminish for some years yet. Rank Xerox points out that Europe creates
4.7bn documents every day and the number of colour reprographic impressions
created in Europe each year is expected to rise by 35 per cent from 1.2bn
now to 4bn by 1996.
Investment, continues, too. Mr Paul Allaire, chairman and chief executive of
Xerox Corporation, claims that despite trading under some of the weakest
economic conditions for a decade, Rank Xerox is growing in its target
markets and continuing to gain market share lost to the Japanese in the
early 1980s. To keep the momentum going, a Ecu235m investment programme is
under way, Ecu64m of which is being spent redeveloping the Systems Centre at
Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire.
Over the past few years, Rank Xerox has reduced its number of suppliers from
4,500 to 350 and, says Mr Allaire, increased quality more than 100 times.
The product development cycle has been shortened by as much as 50 per cent
and product costs have been cut by 30 per cent, despite inflation.
With the market moving upwards in the high volume sector, it is only to be
expected that there would be competition from the Far East.
However, according to Hendriks, the high volume market (ie Segment 5-6,
70cpm and over), will continue to be dominated by Kodak, Oce and Rank Xerox:
'The Japanese are developing higher-volume products, but they do not
represent real competition because they cannot sustain the copy volumes'.
It will not stop the Japanese making inroads, and Ricoh and Konica are just
two gunning for the high-volume sector.
Nevertheless, the advent of the small, integrated systems copier is an
interesting development because it makes on-demand document reproduction a
reality for every business, with completed multipage document sets produced
and ready for despatch in a matter of minutes, without the need for lengthy
user training.
With prices typically around the Pounds 6,000-12,000 mark but starting at
Pounds 1,650 for a low-volume machine, automatic on-line options include
multiple copy paper formats with auto switching from one paper tray to
another; cover and divider sheet insertion; and collating, folding,
punching, stapling and heat binding.
Because of the potential in the small- to medium-size business or department
that has, until now, had to rely on external print shops, the competition is
getting fierce, with main contenders in this sector of the market now
including Agfa, Canon, Konica, Lanier, Minolta, Oce, Olympia, Panasonic,
Ricoh, Sharp and Toshiba.
Colour copiers tend to divide into two categories: 'business colour' units
which normally means they are affordable and easy to use and so are suitable
for general office uses, and 'professional quality colour' machines for
applications where true colour rendering and perfect registration are more
important than cost.
Every manufacturer offers refinements which they hope will make their
machines stand out from the crowd.
Another main trend in the copier market is towards PC-Mac computer
integration to provide a scanning and PostScript printing facility with
options including slide projectors to make copies from 35 mm slides.
An important development in this sector is the Electronics for Imaging (EFI)
Fiery Controller with its PostScript capabilities that transforms a digital
copier into a multifunction device capable of copying, scanning and printing
full-colour images director from a PC or Macintosh computer.
The very first UK installation linked to a ColorEdge 1550 has just been
completed at law firm Denton Hall. Together with the continuous tone colour
printer, it will enable the firm to create information brochures and
customer newsletters on a computer and reproduce these on demand in-house.
They will be able to produce an A4 colour proof in 30 seconds, or an A3 in
one minute, at a cost of 35p against the Pounds 30 the printer used to
charge for a chromalin.
But no matter how sophisticated copier and photocopier technology becomes,
it seems that corporate customers are more concerned with reliability,
quality and value for money than how many bells and whistles it has got,
according to a survey carried out by Kodak Office Imaging. Other priorities
include fast response, availability of parts, ease of telephone contact,
knowledge of the customer's business and good old fashioned courtesy and
helpfulness.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (10): How to move a
mountain - Document Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a world in which 92m original paper documents are produced every year and
corporate files double every 3 1/2 years, document image processing (DIP)
would appear to be the answer to every office manager's dream of reducing
the mountain of paper in circulation.
For it is possible to store between 20,000 and 30,000 documents on one
optical disk, and recall any of them to a VDU screen within seconds.
The potential of systems leads market research company BIS Strategic
Decisions to forecast a compound annual growth rate of 62 per cent for DIP
across Europe by 1995.
Leading companies in the market are bullish about the future, even though
the competition gets stronger by the day.
Contenders now include with Agfa, Bell &amp; Howell, Canon, DEC, IBM, FileNet,
IDL, Kodak, NCR, Olivetti, Philips, Plexus Computers, ROCC Computers,
Tandem, Unisys, Wang and Xionics.
The market could soon get a big boost as a result of the little-publicised
European Data Protection Draft Directive that proposes to bring
non-electronic media within the scope of the law.
A DIP is the obvious solution to maintaining security for all documentation,
since access by unauthorised personnel could be more easily prevented via
the use of standard computer security procedures.
All paper documents that have to be kept for legal reasons could then be put
under padlock and key.
However, the advent of optical disk-based DIP itself does not make the
paper-free, or even the paper-less, information secure if implemented in
isolation.
In the real world, DIP is merely a component part of the corporate-wide
document and information processing and management requirements.
There are several recent developments now capable of supporting such a
strategy.
Mr Mike Mansell, head of Kodak Office Imaging points out: 'During the 1990s,
factory productivity increased by 75 per cent while productivity in the
office increased by only 3 per cent. Why? Because office technology
concentrated on automating tasks rather than whole processes.
'The office manager, systems manager and IT manager may all automate
different aspects of the office process in isolation, only to find they
don't fit together.'
Kodak's answer is the ImageLink strategy which aims to merge micrographics
with digital imaging technologies; integrate imaging systems with
information systems; and, ultimately, utilise imaging to improve
productivity.
Systems currently available allow a document image to be retrieved to a VDU
screen from optical disk or microfilm, distributed to other terminals or
sent electronically to be faxed, printed or copied, then re-filed, all at
the touch of a button.
PPP Private Patient's Plan, however, is anticipating getting rid of
microfiche in favour of optical technology supplied by FileNet.
The solution being implemented is an industry standard PC-based Workflo
Business System that allows an organisation to handle very high volume paper
applications that are transaction-oriented and business critical; to manage
and control the flow of information through the business process across
multiple work groups and departments; and to integrate image information
with other PC tools such as spreadsheets and word processing applications.
The savings that can accrue from introducing new technology are significant.
Using Interleaf technology, Saab Aircraft has saved Pounds 1m a year and cut
turnround time on producing documentation by 50 per cent.
Moss Systems expects to save more than Pounds 120,000 in printing costs by
implementing an Interleaf document management solution.
In the general business document environment, the International Standards
Organisation's (ISO) Office Document Architecture (ODA) support is important
for document interchange across different systems.
In the technical document field, SMGL (Standard Generalised Mark-up
Language) is fast becoming the de facto standard for interchange of
technical documents. For this reason, Interleaf has added this option to
Interleaf 5.
Mr Mike Willcocks, managing director of Interleaf UK, says: 'SMGL is
important in that it will allow business to freely share information held by
different document publishing systems across a variety of platforms and
applications from different manufacturers.
'In effect, information becomes neutral and that is critical requirement to
the future success of EDM systems.'
The management of Expo '92 were luckier than most in that they could start
from scratch to build an enterprise-wide document strategy, at the heart of
which is the Rank Xerox EDM software solution, GlobalView, installed on a
network server on the 20Km Ethernet LAN, the longest LAN in the world
outside the Pentagon.
It is enabling some 600 users to produce documents on any word processing or
desktop publishing workstation and electronically store, print, fax, copy or
distribute them via electronic mail, with instantaneous person-to-person
document delivery ensuring ultra efficiency and high productivity.
By the time Expo had opened, staff had produced and distributed some 260m
impressions; a figure expected to have doubled by the time Expo closes on 20
October 1992.
Electronic document management (EDM) incorporates what is often called
'workflow' management; a combination of techniques and technology to manage
the entire document process at every stage in a document's life cycle, be it
in paper, image or editable electronic form; created in-house or received
from an external source; intended for internal consumption by individuals or
entire departments or external consumption by customers or business
associates; and be it active or archival.
Targetting this market is European Information Technology (EIT) with a
combination of three products that provide an integrated approach to
'multimedia workflow management' which supports every activity except video;
store, edit, despatch verbal, textual and graphical information within and
between offices.
EIT Scan-Link is an entry-level DIP system providing users with a complete
electronic archiving and retrieval system for paper-based documents.
Office-Link is a store and forward message switch which connects network
users to telex, fax, electronic mail, LANs, WANs and X25 networks.
And VoiceLink is a voice mail system which connects the PBX to a PC LAN. All
can work in a Windows environment and can be integrated with management
applications tools such as Lotus Notes.
The key to the success of any system is the ability not only to store
documents rapidly and easily but to be able to retrieve them just as easily
and quickly.
For example, how long would it take you to count the number of times the
words 'at', 'the' and 'be' appeared in 55,000 documents? Days? Weeks?
Months?
The electronic Filing Cabinet (EFC) from Metrologie International would take
just 17 seconds.
The secret is 'fuzzy search,' a content-based retrieval method and an
advanced neural network artificial intelligence (AI) and adaptive pattern
recognition technology from Excalibur Technologies which enables document
contents to be automatically indexed as it is entered.
Utilising open systems network protocols, any image or file can be delivered
to any other system on the network, with document security provided using
DEC's Ultrix file privileges and procedures for protected read and write
access to all files.
With prices starting at Pounds 29,950, such systems are not even out of the
reach of smaller companies.
Is the investment worth it?
Mr Geoff Bedser, senior consultant at CMG who specialises in DIP feasibility
studies and systems evaluations, says that the average payback is between 18
months and three years providing the right system is selected and properly
implemented in the first place.
But at BP Chemicals, Mr Alan Randle, manager IT systems, estimates that the
payback on the Trimco DIP will be much more rapid.
'When we compared the costs of storage and handling and the delay in copying
and transporting paper records with the ease of holding them on optical
disks and transmitting them electronically, we found we could achieve a
six-month payback.'
One of the key indicators to the future of the market must be the
announcement that SA SoftCore NA, the first company in Europe to receive
funding from Advent International under Apple Computer's European Venture
Capital Programme, has set up a UK subsidiary.
The first product to be launched by SoftCore is ArchIS File, an Apple
Macintosh-based system priced at Pounds 10,000, which is less than a quarter
the price of the original proprietary system.
It includes scanner, optical disk drive and all the necessary software to
import, store, retrieve and output any type of document such as text,
computer files, images (colour or black and white), slides, X-rays and
digitised video.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (9): Getting the message
 -Voice Systems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOIA SHILLINGFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE times as many people hang up when they phone a friend and get an
answering machine, than when a business call is answered by a machine,
according to a recent survey carried out by Systems Reliability, a UK
telecoms company.
Despite their antipathy to answering machines, more than two thirds of the
sample said they owned one. The latest models offer solid-state recording,
which means callers' messages are recorded directly onto a chip instead of a
tape. There are no moving parts to break down and there is no delay (for the
owner's greeting to be rewound) after a caller has left a message.
However, solid-state machines are not cheap. Audioline sells one for Pounds
79.99. An equivalent machine without solid state costs Pounds 20 less.
At the top of the range, BT's Falcon II machine includes a handset,
hands-free talking and solid-state outgoing message for Pounds 170. BT also
sells some combined telephone and answering machines with two-way record,
which enable conversations to be recorded. But the most basic machine from
UK electrical retailer Dixons costs less than Pounds 30, and it is not
unusual to find built-in answering machines on personal facsimile machines
and cordless phones.
Although 75 per cent of calls fail to reach their target, answering machines
are still fairly rare in the European business environment. This is also
true of voice messaging, the corporate equivalent.
At their simplest, voice mail systems allow callers to leave messages. By
dialing the appropriate voice mailbox number (and a code), users can play
them back. But most voice messaging systems can do much more. For example,
once a caller has left a message, it can be forwarded from the user to a
colleague, with instructions attached such as: 'Please sort out this
customer's problem and get back to me.'
Voice messaging systems have taken off in the US, partly because the
touch-tone phones (needed to operate them) are in wider use. But acceptance
has been slow in the UK and continental Europe.
The involvement of the UK cellular phone operators has started to change the
picture. Cellnet and Vodafone, the two main UK service providers have both
launched 24-hour voice messaging services. These record all messages left
when the mobile phone is switched off and then alert the user when the phone
is back on. As well as being a big moneyspinner, they have helped to raise
the profile of voice mail.
As a result, research company BIS Mackintosh will shortly be revising
upwards its public voice messaging forecasts.
It originally forecast UK network revenues of Dollars 121.93m for public
messaging services this year and Dollars 779.91m in 1996. Apart from the
cellular operators, leading players in the public voice mail market include
Mercury and BT. BT also has a voice mail service for residential users on
trial.
In-house (or premises-based) voice mail systems offer similar features to
public services. But they involve the one-off purchase of equipment, costing
in the region of Pounds 10,000 for a 100 users. Public services, on the
other hand, are pay-as-you-go.
Most of the premises-based voice mail-voice processing systems available in
Europe are based on North American products.
These were pioneered by companies such as Octel (sold by Hewlett Packard in
the UK), AT&amp;T, VMX (sold by Mercury in the UK), Northern Telecom and
Centigram.
There are three main types of voice system: voice messaging, audiotex and
voice processing. Audiotex is used for 0898 recorded information, such as
racing results, weather information or airline flight times. Some systems
can insert live information, such as the results of the latest racing
fixture, into recorded information.
Voice processing (or interactive voice response) is the type of technology
used in telephone-based home banking systems. It might, for example, prompt
the user to 'press one to order a cheque book, press two for your bank
balance'. In essence, these systems link a voice interface to a computer
database. They allow customers to input and retrieve information using a
touch-tone phone.
The more advanced systems use speech recognition. Because of limitations in
the technology, many use voice synthesis to play back the customer's message
for checking. One system, sold by US-based Syntellect, can recognise
different languages.
There is an increasing amount of overlap between the different voice
technologies. For example, parts of British Rail are using Systems
Reliability's Orbi-Link Network for both voice mail (to notify engineers of
faults) and voice processing (to order parts and compile statistics on
repair times).
The system can also be integrated with local area network-based electronic
mail, allowing users to add voice notes to text messages.
However, the main driver in the premises-based voice systems market is
integration with fax, according to Amanda Jobbins of BIS Mackintosh.
This enables a customer to phone a supplier, select a product and provide a
fax number to which a price-list can be sent automatically. And all without
human intervention on the part of the supplier.
The day might come when customers hang up if they get a human on the line.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (8): Appeal of the
cordless office - Telecommunications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NEWMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOMETHING usually goes wrong when you leave your desk and rely on a
secretary or a colleague to take telephone messages. If you get a message at
all, the chances are you will be given the wrong number, the wrong name, a
confused message, or one that comes a day too late.
If people could take their phones with them about the workplace, the
problems would not arise. And the use of mobile or cordless telephones would
have the added benefit of saving time and money for the telecommunications
manager who currently has to rewire the office each time staff are
relocated.
The appeal of a cordless office has not escaped the attention of
telecommunications equipment manufacturers such as the UK-based GPT and
North American companies Motorola and Northern Telecom who have been
developing cordless telephone products for the past two to three years. This
involves the development of both cordless telephone handsets and office
switches, known as a private automatic branch exchanges (pabx), that can
route calls to and from people using the cordless handsets.
Until now, telecommunications managers have been somewhat sceptical of
cordless office products. This is largely because they rely on the same
technology, called CT2, as the mobile telephone service known as telepoint.
Handsets designed for the cordless office are the same as those for
telepoint services and can also be used as cordless telephones in the home.
CT2 got off to a bad start because the three telepoint services that were
launched in the UK in 1989 have all since closed because of their failure to
capture subscribers.
Misplaced marketing strategies were partly behind their demise, but another
factor was the poor functioning of the equipment. Unless business users can
be guaranteed a quality of service that at least matches a wired telephone
system, it seems most unlikely that they would opt for a cordless system for
use in the office.
But telepoint, and CT2 products generally, are being given a second chance.
Whereas the first telepoint operators used proprietary CT2 technology with
the result that products for different services were incompatible, all
telepoint services in future will be based on a European standard.
In Singapore and Hong Kong, telepoint services based on this standard have
been launched within the past few months and are already proving to be more
reliable and popular than the original UK services.
Users have also been sceptical about cordless office products because
suppliers have been talking about the systems they are developing since 1989
but have been slow to bring out products.
The first products are, however, now beginning to appear. GPT launched its
GPT 2030 cordless system in the UK in April and will bring out more
sophisticated products for larger offices at the end of this year and early
next year. GPT is hoping that Mercury will become a main distributor for its
cordless systems.
Motorola, the US mobile communications equipment manufacturer, is supplying
its Silverlink cordless office systems through UK telephone equipment
distributor Rocom while the Canadian manufacturer Northern Telecom will be
launching office systems in 1992 and 1993. Northern Telecom systems will be
distributed by BT which already sells its wired telephone systems.
Japanese companies including Sony, Matsushita and Kokusai are all keeping a
close eye on the market with a view to developing their own products.
Initially, cordless office products will be significantly more expensive
than conventional office systems and of more limited use. Mel Ziziros, a
senior consultant at MZA, a specialist communications consultancy, says that
the cordless systems currently on the market are at least double the price
of conventional fixed systems. But Gl'T Mobile Systems marketing manager
Bichard Field, says that GPT is only now ramping up to volume, and as costs
come down, GFT will re-evaluate its pricing.
In this respect, the success of cordless office products is tied with the
fortunes of telepoint. If telepoint is successful, handset prices for both
telepoint and cordless office systems will fall as manufacturers derive
economies of scale.
Nevertheless, GPT believes that users will be prepared to pay a premium for
cordless products because of their advantages over wired systems. This view
is shared by Ziziros who reckons: 'Once the price differential comes down to
25 per cent, it will be an entirely different ball game.'
The GPT 2030 system is only suitable for a few users because the system can
connect only three exchange lines and manage, therefore, three simultaneous
conversations.
More advanced CT2 cordless office products will support as many as 20 or 30
simultaneous conversations, but manufacturers recognise that it will not be
possible to develop bigger systems using CT2 technology.
This means that CT2 cordless office systems will only be suited to small
offices, or for a certain category of office worker such as maintenance
staff in bigger companies who tend to spend most of their day moving between
different departments or floors.
For large offices, manufacturers are developing systems using another
European standard known as the digital European cordless telephone (Dect)
system.
Manufacturers such as Sweden's Ericsson or Siemens of Germany that have
backed the Dect standard believe that they can develop cordless telephone
systems for whole office blocks, and that eventually there will be no need
to wire offices.
But the European standard for Dect was only approved this year and the first
demonstrations of Dect products will not take place until 1993. Tony
Warwick, Motorola's director of cordless systems, believes it will be a
further two years until Dect products are launched commercially.
There are different views on whether cordless office systems will ultimately
mean that the wiring of offices becomes a thing of the past.
Ziziros is confident that 'most systems will ultimately be cordless.' But
users are less clear about the future.
John Skarrat, director of the UK Telecommunications Users Foundation, says
that 'radio is always going to have problems with interference' and that
users will remain convinced that it is better to stick to conventional
cable.
Dick Cawdell, director of telecommunications at the Grand Metropolitan
leisure group, thinks that cordless office products are interesting because
they will remove the need for rewiring.
This causes particular problems for Grand Metropolitan whose head office is
in a listed building. Nevertheless, Cawdell recognises that the risk of
replacing wired systems with radio means that 'wired offices are not going
to go away.'

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (7): Typewriters still in
demand - Word Processing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIE HARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You know when a market is not as buoyant as it once was. The market
researchers find more pressing subjects to study. So it is with the
electronic typewriter (ET) and dedicated word processor (DWP) markets.
But although the imminent demise of this sector was forecast when the IBM PC
was born 11 years ago, ETs and WPs are still in demand in banks, building
societies, educational establishments and government departments.
To take just one example, after almost two years of thorough investigation,
Barclays Bank has awarded a two-year contract to Triumph Adler UK for the
supply of the BSS 300. Ideal for the computerised environment, it offers all
the advantages of a typewriter and dedicated word processor, yet comes with
MS DOS-compatible disk drives.
Triumph Adler also believes there is still a market for the professional
typewriter and has revamped the SE 700 series to provide almost silent
operation and easier replacement of typewheels and ribbons.
Mr Alistair Booth, divisional manager of Olivetti UK, says: 'There is a core
market for ETs and DWPs that cannot be served by the PC and, bearing in mind
that profit margins have not been squeezed to the same extent, it has been
viable for us to formulate a pretty intensive programme of product
development.'
As part of that programme the company has just launched a Windows version of
its top-end secretarial workstation, the ETV4000S, a system that has proved
popular among solicitors and architects.
According to Olivetti, there is also a growing market among home users,
hence the decision to launch a range of portable ETs and a portable word
processor last month.
Amstrad, too, still finds a ready market in offices for the PCW-dedicated
word processors, but also has its eye on the home office market with the
launch of a portable WP.
Olympia UK finds that the Comfort WP series is still a very popular line. So
popular, in fact, that it sees no rush to launch the Competence range which
is waiting in the wings.
What of Olympia's traditional typewriter ranges? Mr Colwyn Munro, general
manager, says: 'The trend is towards providing links so they can be
connected up to a PC to provide letter quality printing. It is a growing
demand from users who do not necessarily want to put everything through the
laser printer.'
Panasonic has just launched the KX-W1030 (Pounds 450) portable word
processor offering spelling checker, thesaurus and MS DOS file converter, a
14-line backlit display, 3.5in floppy disk drive and 14cps printer.
Samsung has entered this sector with the SQ-W1000 (Pounds 299), a system for
personal use which offers the convenience of a typewriter with the advanced
functions of a word processor and floppy disk storage.
Smith Corona may have abandoned the PC marketplace, but it intends to stay
in the portable word processing market where it has fielded machines that
feature industry standard 3.5in disk drives and MS DOS file format
compatibility with WordPerfect and Ascii text converters.
Canon claims the Starwriter personal word processor is one of the most
successful products it has ever launched. It has launched a fourth,
top-of-the-range version which introduces a new concept to this sector of
the market: personal publishing. It costs just Pounds 699 for an all-in-one
compact portable unit complete with screen, floppy disk drive and bubblejet
printer.
Brother recently introduced the portable WP-70 (Pounds 525) which features
advanced text editing with spelling checker and mailmerge as well as a
spreadsheet, address book and calendar/scheduler/calculator built-in. It
also includes 3.5in floppy disk drive and 15cps daisywheel printer.
Sharp has just launched the sub-Pounds 300 PA-1200 portable word processor
featuring a high-contrast LCD display, full-function keyboard and in-built
MS DOS-compatible disk drive which runs a modified version of WordPerfect
word processing software.
The continued demand for ETs and DWPs in no way diminishes the need for word
processing software for running on standard desktop PCs.
The packages on offer today have little in common with the early 1980s
versions. They offer sophisticated editing with spelling checkers and
thesauruses and will even check grammar, punctuation, syntax and style, and
enable presentation-quality documents to be produced to desktop publishing
standards, including graphics and photographs.
But although there is a lot more competition, the core market is still
dominated by the few.
Figures from the May 1992 Software Sales Report compiled by market research
specialist Context show that WordPerfect commanded 60 per cent of total UK
word processing sales in the second quarter, WordStar 31.2 per cent and
Microsoft 7.8 per cent.
The total value of software sales in May was more than Pounds 30.5m, of
which WordPerfect contributed Pounds 5.4m.
While WordPerfect for Windows increased its share of WP software sales by
2.5 per cent to 7 per cent, sales of WordPerfect for DOS rose from 50 per
cent to 53 per cent, dispelling the myth that people are only buying Windows
software.
Indeed, DOS is likely to retain its faithful followers for a long time yet,
so further developments can be expected. An example is WordStar for DOS
which has been further developed to include, among other attributes, fax
support that allows users to easily create laser-quality faxable files (PCX)
from their documents without a laser printer.
The output files can be used by many fax software products and boards for
direct transmission to fax machines or other computers.
However, taking a closer look at Windows word processors, a recent report
published by market research organisation Romtec indicates that when it
comes to market share by units, Microsoft's Word for Windows 2.0 is clear
favourite with 58.8 per cent, followed by WordPerfect 5.1 for Windows 23.8
per cent, Ami Pro 2.0 for Windows 13.9 per cent, and WordStar 1.0 for
Windows 2 per cent.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (6): Back to the future -
Fax Machines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 30 years ago, in 1964, Xerox unveiled the Long Distance Xerography
terminal, the world's first facsimile machine for business use.
The LDX system, which consisted of a separate scanner and printer each the
size of a four-drawer filing cabinet, transmitted typed, written or drawn
images and printed them on plain paper.
Since then the business fax machine has shrunk considerably in size and has
become an integral part of most offices. In Britain alone there will be an
estimated 1m fax machines in use by year-end - almost treble the number just
three years ago.
Fax machines today are becoming faster, cheaper and more sophisticated with
some new models even boasting colour transmission.
Equipment sales grew rapidly in the 1980s and although growth in established
markets has been slowed by the recession, office sales have been buoyed in
recent years by the emergence of plain paper, laser, and ink-jet fax
machines which are gradually replacing machines which use thermal paper.
Today there are an estimated 15m-20m fax machines worldwide, a number which
is expected to grow to more than 30m by the end of next year. Most are of
the Group 3 industry standard and can send an A4 sheet across the world in
seconds for the price of a telephone call.
By far the biggest installed base is in the US, but according to
Datamonitor's 1992 European Customer Premises Equipment study, annual
facsimile machine sales in Europe have grown from 350,000 five years ago to
more than 1.7m last year.
These figures hide some other striking trends. In particular the structure
of the European market has been changing. Germany has overtaken the UK in
terms of sales volume and rapidly-falling prices have begun to put a break
on market value growth in recent years.
Furthermore, mature markets such as the UK tend to polarise into two
segments; cheap low-end machines manufactured by companies such as Amstrad
and a host of Far Eastern suppliers, and expensive, high-quality devices
such as plain paper faxes which are often purchased as an upgrade.
The range of machines available has expanded dramatically. Currently there
are more than 200 different types of fax machine on offer from 35 suppliers
in the UK market.
Many of these are small, cheap, desktop machines, ideal for the growing
personal or small office market. Often they combine the functions of
telephone, answering machine, photocopier and fax and can switch between
voice and fax automatically therefore requiring only a single telephone
line.
But almost 30 per cent of the machines currently on sale in the UK are plain
paper fax machines. Although plain paper faxes are generally more expensive
than thermal machines, the price difference is narrowing and the shift
towards plain paper faxes reflects some of the problems associated with
their thermal counterparts.
These include high paper cost, the tendency of text on thermal paper to fade
making it unsuitable for filing or storage, the difficulty of writing on
thermal fax paper and problems re-sending thermal faxes.
Despite the recession, fax-usage is also increasing. The UK market will be
worth about Pounds 750m this year and is growing by about 30 per cent a year
compared to 5 per cent for voice traffic.
A recent Gallup survey conducted for Pitney Bowes Facsimile Systems Division
revealed that 31 per cent of the top 500 companies in the UK increased fax
usage over the past 12 months despite the recession and 91 per cent believe
fax machines helped increase their productivity.
Faster fax transmission speeds cut labour, time and phone costs. Some Group
3 machines already operate at 14.4 kilobits per second (kbps) over the
public switched telephone network and can receive or send an A4 page in
about six seconds. There are also a few Group 4 faxes which were designed to
operate on ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) circuits at 64kbps,
transmitting an A4 page in three to four seconds.
But although Group 4 faxes have been around since the mid-1980s the
introduction of ISDN has been slower than expected. In the meantime, the
transmission speed of Group 3 machines has been further enhanced and an
alternative 64kbps standard has emerged called either Group 3bis or G364.
To overcome some of the problems identified by fax users, telecommunications
groups have seized the opportunity to generate additional income by offering
value-added services to customers.
For example in the US American Telephone and Telegraph offers a subscription
service called EnhancedFAX which enables customers to broadcast a fax,
virtually simultaneously, to as many as 10,000 fax machines worldwide. In
the UK, Mercury's managed fax service, called Surefax, provides a
particularly sophisticated set of value-added services aimed at
multinational customers and launched by the Cable and Wireless group
subsidiary last October.
One significant growth area targeted by the Surefax service is PC-generated
faxes. It is estimated that about 80 per cent of all faxes begin life as a
word-processor file on a PC.
But the document is usually printed out before being loaded into a fax
machine for delivery.
Only 2 per cent of fax traffic is currently sent directly from PCs. But
plug-in cards, external fax-modems and LAN Fax servers are already providing
portable computers, desktop PCs and, most significantly, networked PCs with
the power to send and receive faxes.
Prices for PC fax cards are already lower than those for a cheap fax and fax
cards sales are expected to grow quickly. Indeed, the distinctions between
fax machines and other office equipment are becoming increasingly blurred.
Equipment manufacturers such as Panasonic are already selling fax machines
with computer interfaces which allow PCs to control the operation of the
fax.
Anything received on the fax can be printed out or saved on the PC.
Other devices such as the JetFax produced by Fujitsu connect to laser
printers and enable them to print incoming faxes or send anything generated
on-screen as a fax.
More generally, office equipment suppliers say they have recently detected
increased interest in 'multifunctional digital devices' such as the Xerox
3010 which combines a plain paper fax with a photocopier.
So the fax machine of the future may bear more than a passing resemblance to
the LDX.
Not only is it likely to use plain paper, it will probably also combine a
range of functions including document scanner, photocopier and printer.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (4): More flexible
options - Printers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until the 'paperless office' becomes a reality rather than just a dream
there will be a need for printers to turn personal computer data into words
and graphics on sheets of paper.
Office printer technology has come a long way since the early days. As PCs
have become more powerful, and software more sophisticated, users have
sought more flexible print options.
The printer market today is fiercely competitive and second only, in terms
of volume and value, to PC hardware itself. According to Romtec, the
Berkshire-based marketing consultancy, 745,000 printers worth Pounds 617m
were sold in 1991. Volume sales are forecast to increase by 50 per cent by
1996 and by at least 20 per cent to about Pounds 740m in terms of value.
But the mix of sales is also changing rapidly from older, 'impact' printing
techniques such as dot matrix and daisywheel, to newer, non-impact methods
such as inkjet and light-emitting diode (Led) and laser.
While daisywheel printers have all but disappeared, dot-matrix printers
still hold more than 40 per cent of the total printer market and have an
important role to play. The latest 24-pin dot matrix printers from companies
such as Epson, Panasonic, Star and Oki are capable of producing high quality
text and graphics at bargain prices.
Meanwhile, dot matrix line printers, with speeds of up to 5,000 lines per
minute, are the office workhorses, especially suited to printing multipart
forms, invoices and other stationary on continuous-feed paper.
Nevertheless, as prices tumble, the underlying trend is towards non-impact
machines. These are much quieter than impact printers and combine high speed
with advanced text and graphics handling capabilities.
The level of demand for inkjet printers, which can now be bought for as
little as Pounds 300, has even taken some suppliers by surprise.
Hewlett-Packard, the market leader, has had to build a new US factory to
turn out 500,000 inkjets a month.
Lightweight inkjet printers such as those sold by Cannon, Mannesmann Tally
and Kodak are also proving very successful in the fast-growing portable
market.
But in the office desktop market, where users are demanding higher print
capabilities to match their software, those who need speed as well as
quality can now buy eight-page-per minute (ppm) laser printers for less than
Pounds 1,000 at street prices, or 4ppm lasers for less than Pounds 600.
Laser and Led printers accounted for more than a quarter of all printer
sales in the UK last year and are expected to take at least a third of 1996
sales. Inkjet printers are forecast to take a further third, giving
non-impact technologies about two thirds of the total UK market by 1996.
Another important factor driving laser printer sales is the increasing trend
towards networking PCs and the growth of workgroup computing, which opens up
the possibility of sharing printers and helps justify the steady migration
to more expensive, high-speed (16ppm to 20ppm), heavy-duty network laser
printers such as Compaq's new Pagemarq printers aimed at a market expected
to reach Dollars 30bn by the mid-1990s.
The worldwide market for personal printers is forecast to grow by just over
18 per cent 1992 to 1995, while unit sales of network printers are expected
to increase by 26 per cent over the same period, according to
Massachusetts-based BIS Strategic Decisions and Compaq Computer estimates.
According to Romtec, Epson and Hewlett Packard (HP) dominated the UK PC
printer market in 1991, with respective market shares by volume of 22.4 and
22.1 per cent. Because Epson's product mix is biased toward lower-cost dot
matrix printers, compared to HP's focus on laser and inkjet machines, their
market share by value is very different, with HP taking 34.4 per cent and
Epson just 13 per cent.
Within the laser printer market, HP is the clear market leader, but under
increasing competitive pressure from companies such as Lexmark, the IBM
alliance company, and Oki, both of which have been increasing market share.
HP's success in laser printing owes much to the development of its Printer
Command Language (PCL). The vast majority of laser and Led printers support
PCL, leaving manufacturers to differentiate their products through other
features such as font capabilities, greater speed and easier paper handling.
A growing number of laser printers, however, now support Adobe PostScript
which offers greater font and graphics flexibility than even the latest
versions of PCL.
Among the most exciting developments in printer technology is the gradual
appearance of colour desktop printing capability. Some dot-matrix machines
provide cheap, but somewhat limited, colour options. Colour inkjets provide
a more flexible higher quality option and are increasingly popular. But
colour lasers are rapidly declining in price although they still command a
hefty price premium and therefore serve a specialist niche rather than a
mass market.
Laser printer manufacturers are focusing on the environment. Most laser
printers tend to generate a lot of waste in the form of used toner
cartridges and printer drums. In response to growing concern about the
environment many manufacturers now operate cartridge recycling schemes.
Some manufactures have adopted even more radical approaches. Among them
Kyocera claims its new ecologically friendly Ecosys FS-1500 printer reduces
the cost of ownership by about two thirds to 0.6p a page. Unlike
conventional lasers which need replacement printer drums periodically,
Kyocera's Led machine is built around an amorphous silicon (aSi) drum which
is durable, scratch-resistant and, it is claimed, will last the life of the
printer - even when using abrasive recycled paper.
Another potential problem with laser printers, and xerographic copiers, is
that they generate ozone which can pose a health hazard to office workers
and has been blamed for triggering allergies. The ozone is normally trapped
by an air filter, but with use the filter clogs up and ozone emissions can
rise.
Now Canon, which makes 80 per cent of the world's laser printer engines, has
developed a way to reduce ozone emission substantially by replacing the
highly charged wire in a laser printer with a special charge transfer roller
so that even if the filter clogs there is still no significant release of
ozone. Other printer manufacturers, including both HP and Kyocera, are
following Canon's lead.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (5): New and exciting
products - Office Software
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DENNIS KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 1990s will bring about the biggest revolution in office software that we
have ever seen. The decade is about useability, software that is flexible,
interesting to use and designed to meet the real needs of the business.
Gone are those boring inflexible systems that operated on different
computers, never talking to each other and churning out endless reams of
paper which no-one read.
We are now seeing the emergence of new and exciting software that will pave
the way to fully integrated office solutions of the future. Software has
been developed with Europe in mind, providing a standard solution for
subsidiary companies across Europe, no matter in which country they operate.
The problem is that most of the business software that exists at the moment
is of the boring, inflexible type and therefore there will be a transition
over the next two or three years as companies realign themselves to the new
generation of software being developed. The most important aspect in this
realignment is choosing the operating system for the future.
It is now accepted that the old proprietary operating systems - that is
systems developed by hardware manufacturers to run exclusively on their own
hardware platforms - are just about dead and buried. The only exception is
IBM with its proprietary mid-range and main-frame systems.
The trend today is towards Open Systems; systems that can operate on a
variety of hardware platforms, outside the control of any one manufacturer.
Open Systems encompasses the multi-user environments of DOS Networks and
Unix. There are still many suppliers of DOS Networks and many flavours of
Unix, but over the next few years they should align themselves behind the
leading suppliers. Novel is starting to dominate the Network environment and
Unix International the Unix environment.
Many people still have a PC at one end of their desk and a dumb terminal at
the other. The future will be the PC alone as the personal entry point to
the computer system. Open System Network environments, with their
client-server architecture, enable the PC to act as the client linking to a
variety of servers configured for Unix, Digital's VMS or IBM's AS/400. But
this is not a PC using terminal emulation, this is a PC using its own hard
disk to store local programs and only interrupting the server to update the
data files located centrally.
While the hardware technology for Open Systems Networks exists, very few
business and accounting packages have been developed to make use of this
client-server technology. In fact there are still very few business and
accounting packages that provide a really integrated office solution. Modern
offices use word processors, spreadsheets, databases and electronic mail but
few developers have tried to integrate these with the business and
accounting system, and in many cases these software packages operate on
different computer systems that are not even linked together.
Users of spreadsheets, word processing and desk-top publishing systems
widely accept the use of Windows, but users of business and accounting
systems are not taken with this new technology. However, advancements in the
design of the modern integrated business system reduces the need for
intensive data entry and the Windows environment will become more important.
September 1992 has brought with it a large number of launches of new and
innovative business and accounting software products.
Sage, with its market leading entry-level Sterling product, is launching
Sterling+2 which is an advanced design of the existing product,
incorporating the advantages of either the Windows environment or the
character-based DOS environment - whichever the user prefers.
It will be one of the first packages to have one screen that shows all of
the information for the quarterly VAT return, and an invoice entry screen
that really looks like an invoice.
There has been a significant gap in the Unix market for highly functional
mid-range business software capable of handling more than 50 users. In that
market, Tetra has revamped its market-leading Unix package, Chameleon, as
Chameleon 2000 with higher functionality designed around the lnformix Online
database engine to cope with larger volumes of transactions.
There are too many business packages available with no significant market
leaders. In the next few years, as the software market matures, we will
start to see packages that can be easily differentiated from the boring
run-of-the-mill software that exists today. Fully integrated office products
are now arriving on the scene.
Exact, the market leader in Holland, is launching its financial package in
the UK later this year, which directly links to spreadsheet packages
cell-by-cell, giving a high level of on-line financial reporting.
We are now seeing packages with direct links to the leading databases with
products such as Oracle Financials, Cedardata CFACS, IBM's FMS/R, Prophesy,
Miracle Tapestry, and Strata. Some packages are starting to link directly to
E-Mail, such as Computer Associates' Masterpiece for the authorisation of
invoices and many packages are starting to realise the importance of
Executive Information Systems (ElS), providing drill-down/zoom capability
and data in a graphical form with packages such as Kerridge, Fairview
Control and QSP OLAS.
It takes time to find the right software and with more than 800 different
business and accounting products available in the UK, it is not a
straightforward task. It is easy to find highly functional products that do
not integrate with other products. But the future is about a totally
integrated office environment that really is user friendly.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (3): Increasingly popular
 -Networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST three years ago, 70 per cent of personal computers sold in the UK were
intended for standalone use, with the remainder destined to join a network
or multi-user system. This year, the numbers have been reversed, with 55 per
cent of PCs sold being linked in some way, according to IDC, the market
research group.
The latest networking technology has made it possible to share data among
different types of computer, not just between PCs, minicomputers and
mainframes but also between PC-compatibles and Apple hardware, and PCs
running different operating systems and applications software.
The growth in office PC networks is being driven by two converging trends.
Some companies are 'downsizing', replacing the traditional office
minicomputer and dumb terminals by networked PCs, while others are linking
together standalone PCs for the first time.
There are many reasons why office PC networks are increasingly popular. In
particular, advocates claim that it only costs half as much to get an
application up and running on a personal computer network as on a
minicomputer. It is not just software development which costs less; tumbling
PC prices mean it is also much cheaper to buy PCs and hook them together in
a local area network (Lan).
Similarly, linking together a group of PCs offers the potential for sharing
not only information and files, but also costly resources such as printers
and other devices, even in small offices.
A basic peer-to-peer network is little more than a collection of cables and
special software. Nevertheless it offers a wide variety of potential
benefits. The most obvious benefit is file sharing. All authorised users on
a PC network have instant access to the files on other machines. This means
shared files can be worked on and updated by a group of people without the
need for duplicate files on several machines.
Similarly, software applications can also be shared. This means training is
simplified, productivity is improved and data management becomes easier. In
addition, 'groupware' such as electronic mail or voicemail can be
implemented.
Perhaps most significantly, network resources such as printers can be
shared. This means network users can all be given access to expensive
high-speed network laser printers, colour printers, plotters, scanners and
fax modems. Instead of several expensive devices, the network links everyone
in the office to the device and automatically 'queues' requests when more
than one person requires access at the same time.
Aside from economy, the appeal of a work group sharing one high-quality
printer has several attractions. For example, many people in an office do
not generate enough print jobs to warrant a dedicated laser printer but may
require very high quality when they do print.
An office network also allows the integration of non-compatible computers.
Many offices today have a mix of PCs, Apple Macintoshes and perhaps Unix
workstations. A network can solve the problem of incompatible hardware and
operating systems by translating all data into a form that can be understood
and used by different makes of computer in the office.
There are many non-standard, low-cost networks - many of which do not even
require special network adaptor cards - that will allow you to connect up
these modest machines and share files, and sometimes even other devices such
as printers, between them.
However, more sophisticated PC networking, which enables applications to be
'network aware,' requires a system which conforms to certain industry
standards covering, in particular, cabling, network adaptor cards and
network operating system software.
Among the most popular Lan technologies are Ethernet, originally developed
by Xerox for use with co-axial cable and subsequently with 'thin-wire' coax
and eventually over unshielded, twisted-pair, telephone-style wiring, and
IBM Token Ring which is often used in PC networks and has been gaining
market share at the expense of Ethernet. But Fiber Distributed Data
interface technology, developed with the support of many vendors, is likely
to become the dominant standard for the next generation of Lans.
Popular adaptor cards include Token Ring and AppleTalk which allows PC users
to connect into Apple Macintosh networks, IBM PCN and others. Many low-cost
networks are sold as a single package - containing cabling, network adaptor
card and network operating system software. But while starter packs are a
convenient way to get a modest new network up and running, the real key to
success lies in choosing the right 'network operating system' software.
It is the arrival of effective PC networking standards in the past couple of
years which has most facilitated the growth in Lans and enabled them to grow
much faster than the PC industry as a whole. By far the most popular network
operating system is Novell's NetWare which claims more than 70 per cent of
the market and is supported by virtually all leading network-aware
applications.
Other leaders in the market include Banyan's VINES and Microsoft with its
Lan Manager (and IBM's variant Lan Server).
One remaining uncertainty is which underlying PC operating system will
emerge victor in the battle between Microsoft, IBM, and Novell which has
acquired Digital Research. Although Microsoft is heavily tipped to win this
battle - with a combination of its MS-DOS operating system and its Windows
operating environment - IBM is fighting back with OS/2, the operating system
originally co-developed by IBM and Microsoft as a successor to MS-DOS.
Meanwhile the big software houses have jumped on the network bandwagon,
developing personal computer applications, or 'group ware' such as Lotus
Notes' communications package, designed specifically for PC networking.
According to Datamonitor Analysis, local area internetworking equipment,
designed to connect otherwise incompatible systems, is the fastest-growing
area of the European data communications market and grew by 63 per cent to
Dollars 390m last year. Overall, Datamonitor estimates that the total
European Lan hardware market was worth Dollars 1.65bn last year.
While many of these new hardware and software products are designed to make
it easier to manage the physical network system of plug-in PC cards, cables
and connecters, the next generation of networks may not even need these.
Wireless networks, using radio or infra-red signals in place of cables, have
already begun to appear, as have PCs specifically designed for networking.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (2): An explosion of
activity - Portable Computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN its infancy, portable computing was only for the really dedicated. The
first transportable computers were heavyweight, bulky, mains-powered
machines with tiny screens, large floppy disk drives and less memory than
many of today's pocket electronic organisers.
But in the past five years computing on the move has become a realistic
business option as rapid advances in technology have provided the ability to
pack large amounts of processing power and big slabs of memory into
shrinking packages which sell for ever-decreasing prices.
'Transportables' were replaced by 'laptops' which have now been replaced
themselves 'notebooks,' 'sub-notebooks' and even 'palmtop' computers. Today
'the office portable' is likely to be a high-power, full-function computer
in a clam-shell case no bigger than a thick pad of A4 paper and weighing
less than 3kg.
Although most notebook computers still have monochrome displays, many
manufacturers now offer top-of-the-range models with high-definition colour
screens, as well as hard disks and the latest Intel 486 microprocessors.
As prices drop, the colour notebook sector is likely to be the fastest
moving within the notebook market. A recent survey carried out by PC
manufacturer AST and What Micro? magazine in the UK shows that price and
application requirements are driving the colour notebook market.
Nearly 90 per cent of respondents said colour notebooks provided a practical
solution to their application requirements. And 65 per cent said price
reductions would encourage them to buy colour notebooks.
The most popular application for colour notebook PCs is word processing,
mentioned by 88 per cent of respondents. This is followed by graphics (66
per cent), databases (64 per cent) and spreadsheets (62 per cent).
Surging sales of notebook PCs have already given the flagging desktop PC
market a boost, although with prices tumbling, it is consumers rather than
manufacturers who have gained. In the UK last year, notebook computer
shipments more than trebled to 75,000 units worth about Pounds 87m,
according to market estimates.
This sales boom has produced an explosion of activity among manufacturers,
assemblers and retailers. Only a few companies such as Toshiba, whose
machines provide the benchmark by which others are often judged, have
managed to carve out significant shares of the market. Figures from Romtec,
the market consultancy, give Toshiba 30 per cent of the UK notebook market
and 39 per cent of the overall UK portable computer market.
A standard notebook based upon Intel's popular 80386SX chip can now be
bought for well under Pounds 1,000, colour machines can be bought for a few
hundred pounds more, and the gap in price-performance between portable and
equivalent desktop computers is continuing to narrow.
Members of the latest generation of notebook PCs are able to run the same
power and memory-hungry programs - such as Microsoft's popular Windows -
that run on the office desktop and can therefore be fully integrated into a
company's computer systems.
Data can be transferred between the notebook computer and the office system
by exchanging floppy discs or PCMCIA memory cards, hard wire or local area
network (LAN) connections, or over a telephone line using a modem. UK-based
Portable PC Peripherals has even developed an internal card for Compaq
laptops and notebooks which allows direct connection to IBM mainframes.
Some portable PCs have even been designed to lock into a desktop 'docking
station,' allowing them to be used with superior screens and keyboards if
required and to hook into the office LAN, sharing software and hardware
devices.
Even machines without this facility can be an attractive option for offices
where desktop space is at a premium. But the principal attraction of a
portable computer for most users is its portability, even though research
suggests relatively few portable computer buyers actually use their machines
while travelling. Surveys have consistently shown that most portable
computers are used either in the office or at home, but rarely actually on
the move.
One reason for this may be that although notebook computers have themselves
got thinner and lighter, they can still take up a large chunk of a
briefcase. Manufacturers such as Italy's Olivetti and Vortec, part of
Korea's Samsung group, have recently responded by introducing a new class of
lightweight sub-notebook or A-5 sized machines.
These new machines feature large-sized LCD screens, only slightly
scaled-down Qwerty keyboards, hard-disk storage and full desktop PC
compatibility all squeezed into a small 1kg package. However some
established portable PC manufacturers question whether there is a market for
the new A5 machines. They point out that lighter and cheaper notebooks and
more sophisticated palmtops, such as the PC-compatible Sharp PC 3000 which
can fit in a large pocket, have already arrived.
Another potentially limiting feature of portable computers has been their
relatively short battery life, often only between one and four hours under
normal use. However this too is changing with low-power processors,
sophisticated power management software, and innovations in battery
technology itself.
Market analysts also believe portable PCs will become more versatile and
more application-specific with the addition of communications capabilities
such as paging, remote wireless networking, and fax-modems.
Demand for notebook PCs has already fueled sales of other portable office
equipment such as printers and is likely to help sales of new digital
cellular telephones in the next few years.
The trend towards portable computers fits into a broader move towards more
compact integrated office equipment. A more mobile workforce requires more
mobile equipment which can be used in the office, on site or at home.

<TEXT>
As tomorrow's 100th anniversary of the death of the poet Tennyson coincides
with the opening of the Conservatives' annual conference, Observer has
combed the bard's works for pointers to help the Tory delegates in their
debates.
Only three have emerged, the balance being in favour of the Euro-sceptic
persuasion - particularly this extract from an ode on the opening of
parliament on February 3 1852:
As long as we remain, we must speak free,
Tho' all the storm of Europe on us break;
No little German state are we . . .
More sinister, for John Major at least, may be the couplet in the poem Hands
All Round, which reads:
That man's the true Conservative,
Who lops the moulder'd branch away.
As for the premier's supporters, all there is to encourage them is a single
line from Locksley Hall:
Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.

Will history repeat itself? Three years ago today the government was
embroiled in a political row about the ERM. An embattled chancellor of the
exchequer (Nigel Lawson) had to raise interest rates by a percentage point,
to a record 15 per cent, in a desperate bid to stem a run on the pound. It
didn't work and on the eve of the Tory party conference the pound fell by 6
pfennigs.
This time round there is an even bigger ERM row, the pound is sinking fast
and, like last time, there are increasing calls for the chancellor's
resignation. True, interest rates have not been raised (yet). But a
fortnight after Nigel Lawson's 1989 speech to the Tory party faithful, he
had quit despite an impassioned plea from his deputy, Norman Lamont, who
wrote 'please don't do it. It isn't necessary.'
Those who believe that history repeats itself will be watching tomorrow's
Daily Mail. It filled its front page on the opening day of the 1989
conference with a banner headline calling for Lawson to go.

Sir Nigel Broackes, the founder of Trafalgar House, has his critics. But he
can't be accused of underestimating the clout of his new, and biggest,
shareholder - the Keswicks' Hongkong Land. He describes himself as a 'minor
patrician' compared to the Keswick brothers.
Old Etonian Simon Keswick, chairman of HongKong Land, and his elder brother
Henry, chairman of the Jardine Matheson parent, may not be knighted like Sir
Nigel and their father, the late Sir William Keswick (a former director of
the Bank of England and Governor of the Hudson's Bay Company), but their
City connections outclass Sir Nigel's.
Henry is on the board of Sun Alliance, Robert Fleming, Rothmans

plugged into the Tory party hierarchy - Sir Charles Powell sits on their

Goldsmith and Garry Weston. Simon, recently given a seat on the Hanson
board, is a bit more raffish and apart from being a member of the Queen's
Body Guard for Scotland, is a Tottenham Hotspur fan, according to his Who's

If you count the other brother - Hambros Bank chairman 'Chips' Keswick  -
one begins to feel a certain sympathy for the underdog in the coming

FT  05 OCT 92 / Observer: Heavy burden
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are big businesses where the death of a top engineer is hardly
noticed. But not the coal industry. The sudden death of Ken Moses, only a
few months after he was appointed one of British Coal's two joint deputy
chairmen, is a bitter blow not only for his family but for the industry, and
the government.
Having graduated from Wigan Mining College, Moses showed that it was still
possible for a self-made man to make it from the coal face to the top of
British Coal. Although he was one of the hard-nosed managers who helped Sir
Ian MacGregor break the coal strike in the early 1980's, he was a passionate
believer in the industry and was playing a key role in its privatisation as
British Coal's strategic planning director.
With the recent retirement of John Northard and Ken Moses' death, an even
bigger burden now falls on Bert Wheeler, the remaining deputy chairman,
especially since his chairman Neil Clarke is not an engineer and is a
newcomer to the industry.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Observer: Distance no object
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The use of distance as an excuse for inaction has certainly not diminished
since Neville Chamberlain dismissed Hitler's 1938 invasion of the
Sudetenland as a quarrel in a 'far away country'.
But the old excuse has been shunned by Swiss industrialist Stephan
Schmidheiny. Outside his homeland, he is best known for his championship of
the environment, not least as leader of the Business Council for Sustainable
Development at the 'earth summit' in Rio in June.
Hence his embarrassment when Observer's colleague in Chile subsequently
reported on an iron-pellet plant there belonging to a company in which
Schmidheiny has a 30 per cent stake.
The plant was belching out 37 tonnes of iron dust and the like daily, more
than 50 times the amount permissible in the US, and reputedly harming the
local olive groves and sea fishery. Yet far from espousing the attitudes of
its Swiss stakeholder, the company was fighting clean-up orders all the way
to the Chilean supreme court.
Confronted with the case, Schmidheiny said he'd known nothing about it, but
would investigate. Now he's issued a statement on the results. True, it
ruminates about the difficulties of implementing sustainable development
policies in a country such as Chile. But Schmidheiny promises that the plant
will be cleaned up gradually at a cost of as much as Dollars 30m.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Transport safety and the high price of human life: The
sensitive question of whether too much is spent on reducing the risks of
travelling by public transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a hard question to ask after air disasters such as last night's crash
in Amsterdam and last week's in Nepal: but is there a limit to how much
should be spent on transport safety?
The instinctive answer is that no sum can be too high if it results in the
saving of a human life. In Britain, however, a body of opinion is daring to
argue not only that a limit exists, but that in some cases it may have been
reached.
Britain's current attitudes to transport safety were shaped by a series of
horrific transport disasters in the late 1980s, such as the Clapham rail
crash and the London Underground fire at King's Cross. These were followed
by reports demanding hundreds of millions of pounds' worth of measures to
improve transport safety.
The spending duly came, and has continued since. Last year, for example,
British Rail spent Pounds 225m on safety projects, equivalent to more than
10 per cent of total passenger receipts. London Underground's outlay of
Pounds 120m was, proportionally, higher still at nearly 20 per cent of
sales.
Even at these levels, safety spending is sometimes criticised as inadequate.
But ministers, fearful of the political consequences, dare not question the
sums it absorbs. On the contrary, they publicly insist that no safety
project put forward by BR or London Underground is ever refused.
Last month, however, came a watershed when Mr Brian Appleton, a retired
industrialist, produced a report for the Health and Safety Executive on the
Underground's response to fire and bomb alerts.
One of Mr Appleton's conclusions was that the risk of station fires on the
Underground had been so greatly reduced since the King's Cross disaster that
further spending on fire precautions could not be justified. The money would
be better spent on, say, new signalling systems to reduce the hazard of
train crashes.
This was not the same as saying that safety spending overall should be cut.
Nevertheless, the report broke new ground by acknowledging that there may
come a point in any area of safety where risks become tolerable and further
spending is wasted.
Emotional responses aside, the argument has logic. There is, after all, no
such thing as total safety: even lying in bed has its hazards (the ceiling
might fall in, or an electrical fault could set the house on fire). What
matters to people is that the level of risk should be acceptable in relation
to the benefits derived.
One example of this principle is people's attitude towards the relative
risks of travelling by car, bus or train. Most people know that it is far
safer to travel by public transport than by car, yet they are prepared to
accept the greater risk of car travel for the benefits of comfort and
convenience it brings.
This is not to say that public transport, already very safe, could not be
safer still. The trouble is, further progress is becoming ever more
expensive. This is because, over the years, the cheapest and most effective
options for cutting casualty rates have gradually been used up, so that each
progressive advance in safety saves fewer lives at greater cost.
This might matter little if money for safety came out of a bottomless pit.
But the constraints on BR's financial resources mean that every pound spent
on safety is at the expense of investment in other things valued by
passengers, such as faster and more reliable trains, or lower fares.
So how can we be sure that money spent on safety is being spent wisely?
Economists such as Prof Michael Jones-Lee, a specialist in transport safety
at Newcastle University, say the answer is to give safety benefits a
monetary value so that they can be properly evaluated against other options
for the allocation of resources. This, however, requires some sort of value
to be put on the cost of a human life.
Obnoxious as this concept may appear, it has been with us for years. Courts,
for example, award compensation for the loss of loved ones (and their income
streams), and the National Health Service is constantly required to decide
whether it can justify the cost of carrying out expensive life-saving
operations.
In fact, the Department of Transport has quietly been putting a monetary
value on the cost of human casualties since 1968. It uses the figures to put
a value on the safety benefits of road schemes, so helping it decide whether
the costs of schemes are justified.
In the early years, the department's calculation of the cost of a fatality
was based mainly on the value of a victim's lost production. However, this
method faced objections because it failed to reflect the value that people
attach to life itself; so in 1988 the department changed to a
willingness-to-pay approach.
Under this system, attempts are made through interviews and other techniques
to determine what amounts of money people are prepared to pay for a given
decrease in the risk of a fatal accident. As a result of studies carried out
for the Transport Department by Prof Jones-Lee, the value attributed to a
marginal reduction in the risk of a road accident fatality is now set at
Pounds 683,000.
Although this figure is used to assess the safety benefits of road schemes,
no attempt has yet been made to carry out any cost-benefit analysis of
safety spending in public transport. But working backwards from calculations
of how much is being spent on safety and how much the risk of fatalities has
been reduced, BR and the Underground estimate that the cost is running at
around Pounds 2m per fatality saved.
Is that too much? If the Transport Department is right about how much people
are willing to pay for a reduction in fatalities, it is way over the top.
Yet, as Prof Jones-Lee argues, it is not quite as simple as that. If asked,
people would probably attach a higher value to public transport safety than
road safety because public transport requires them to yield their fate to
the care of another party. People are also inherently averse to being
involved in an air, sea, rail or Underground crash because of the fear that
their doom may be certain and ghastly.
If anything is clear about the levels of safety spending in public
transport, it is that no one knows what they should be. But BR and London
Underground both privately acknowledge that the cost of some safety measures
 -for example, some of the more elaborate fire precautions required by law
in the wake of the King's Cross fire - is out of all proportion to the tiny
reductions in risk they produce.
Instilling a rationale into safety spending need not be particularly
difficult. If only the Transport Department would commission a study into
what levels of safety were required of public transport and how much people
were prepared to pay for them, implementation would be easy. BR and London
Underground would welcome such a move: so, too, might the government, if it
found itself saving money. It could, however, prove harder to sell to the
electorate: and harder still after the next transport disaster.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: Figures point to personal benefits and real savings
of community care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M J DAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was interested to read Maggie Urry's article on the nursing home
sector and the changes occurring in the care market with Implementation of
Care in the Community ('Costings are tight in an ageing market', September
23).
Some of the issues which the article addresses should be looked at in the
context of the whole caring market and Community Care.
The NHS and Community Care Act will be implemented by local authorities over
a period of 10 years from April 1, 1993.
The article implied that there was apprehension about the Act and that the
industry was unsure about how best to put it into practice. However, in
Tunstall's experience, most of the authorities are well down the road in
determining their own strategies for implementation and have submitted
detailed plans already.
The Act's principal aim is to promote the development of services which
enable people to remain in their homes wherever that is feasible or
sensible.
Although Maggie Urry states that the top nursing home companies have only 4
per cent of the total market, it must be remembered that this market also
constitutes residential homes, sheltered housing, NHS long-stay hospital
wards, and home care.
It will be the responsibility of local authority care managers to allocate
funds to these different sectors, while providing individuals with maximum
choice.
Public expenditure on community based care in England is now a third greater
than that spent on the hospital service. The government has pledged to
increase the proportion of public expenditure which is directed towards
caring for people in their own homes.
Figures compiled by Professor A. Tinker show that the cost of caring for
someone in their own home is Pounds 1,000 a year less than residential care
and almost Pounds 15,000 a year less than hospital care.
The Public Accounts Committee's 26th report, published in November 1988,
highlighted that almost 25 per cent of those receiving benefits for
residential care could have remained in their own homes had community
support services been available.
The NHS and Community Care Act is now well under way and companies such as
Tunstall are working with local authorities to ensure a smooth and efficient
transition from next April.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: World Bank commercial lending cue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NIGEL WILKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Prowse's reflection on the worldwide cutbacks in overseas aid
budgets ('The twilight of foreign aid', September 28) implies that
commercial sources of finance are readily available to make good the
shortfall in official funding for the developing countries.
In fact, the decline in commercial lending has been so severe that, since
the onslaught of the debt crisis 10 years ago, net flows of commercial
capital with the developing countries have been negative. The reduction in
official aid flows will create something of a dilemma for the World Bank,
but there is more that it could do to promote lending from commercial
sources.
The bank's Expanded Cofinancing Operations (ECOs) do not go far enough to
induce the commercial banks to participate, despite the latter's excellent
repayment record.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: Conflict fails to survive translation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KLAUS D. LEITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, James Morgan must have slipped a few pages in his dictionary or
succumbed to a Freudian mis-translation in rendering 'Es ist doch kein
Krieg' as 'It's not a war yet' ('As they say in Europe', September 26).
He seems to have confused 'doch' with 'noch', which makes for an entirely
dIfferent meaning.
What the Bundesbank official is quoted as having said is precisely this in
English: 'This isn't a war after all'.
That translation is not nearly as spectacular as a statement and it
certainly does not carry the connotation that the Bundesbank is 'spoiling
for a fight', as the mis-translation suggests.
Anecdotal evidence suggests to me that some people in Britain are positively
heartened by war-like allusions to political or economic clashes with
Germany.
Such allusions no doubt serve as reminders of Britain's greatness and past
superiority.
The current Anglo-German 'war of words' is surely going to escalate now that
some German officials appear to have hit upon a commemoration of the V2
rocket development as a riposte to the Harris memorial.
A quality paper should perhaps take care not to support this war with the
journalistic equivalent of dumdum ammo.

Sir, Why all the criticism of Britain's chancellor? Has he not achieved
momentous feats recently? How many chancellors can claim to have cut
interest rates by 5 per cent, twice confounded commentators by perfectly
executed U-turns, and lost Pounds 11,000 a second, all within 24 hours?
Moreover, it is a singularly generous act, on our chancellor's part, to
allow the Germans and French to take the lion's share of the glory for these
achievements, and to go so far as to understate his own role in bringing
about this return to traditional values (such as, for example, a falling
pound).

FT  05 OCT 92 / Letter: Latin America has coffee gene diversity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS FLEMING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The article 'Harvesting a cornucopia' (Technology, September 18)
highlights a statement that 'all the coffee in Latin America comes from one
original tree brought from Africa. This kind of narrow gene base makes
plants extremely vulnerable to being wiped out by disease.'
That statement is not correct, because at least two species of coffee,
arabica and robusta, were introduced to Latin America, and it has to be
improbable that these were the only introductions, especially in the past
half century when breeders of most major crops have been working hard to
widen the gene base of their breeding material.
The proposition that there was only one tree probably derives from a story
that about 1723 a young French officer de Clieu carried one seedling to
Martinique from the royal hothouse of Louis XV in Paris. Subsequently, seed
from this particular tree was reputedly very widely planted.
That item apart, the content of the article is sound. The rubber plantation
industry in the east (not only in Malaysia) was based on only a small number
of trees brought from Brazil, but the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia
has for many years been bringing new material collected in the Amazon,
through a quarantine station in the Caribbean. A particular concern is to
produce high yielding trees which would be resistant to South American leaf
blight, a virulent disease which could cause very serious problems if it
reached the east.
The world plantation oil palm industry developed from an even narrower gene
base than rubber and involved only seed from four oil palms planted in the
Botanic Gardens at Bogor in Java in 1848. Here again breeders have been
working for many years to widen the base of breeding material.

Sir, In your coverage of the First Islamic Venture Capital Company ('Islamic

the first time that a specificaly Islamic or ethical fund has been
launched.'
In fact, several such funds have been launched. In 1986, the Amana Mutual
Fund was launched in the US by the Islamic Society of North America, and the
Islamic Fund/ Falcon Fund was launched by Kleinwort Benson in the Channel
Islands. The latter reports its results in your newspaper. In 1991, Mendaki
(an Islamic social welfare organisation) jointly launched the Mendaki Growth
Fund with the Development Bank of Singapore. Only a few weeks ago, Arab
Malaysian Bank launched an Islamic Unit Trust in Kuala Lumpur. Many Islamic
unit trusts and mutual funds operate out of Bahrain, Dubai, Qatar and Saudi
Arabia.
The novelty of Islamic funds has long ago worn off. Now, the issues are the
performance of these funds compared with conventional funds, and the depth
of the market.

Only one of the 12 regional companies is believed to have responded to

Renegotiation is likely to present difficulties, however, as Nuclear
Electric is considering the legal implications and the question of

FT  05 OCT 92 / Cost of residential care 'forcing old to sell homes'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS and ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RISING cost of long-term residential care is forcing the elderly to sell
their homes, according to a report published today by the Family Policy
Studies Centre, an independent research body.
But even the sale of a house will be insufficient to pay for more than five
years in a private nursing home on average, according to the report,
sponsored by Help the Aged.
An average house, realising around Pounds 66,000, would pay for eight years
in private residential care without nursing.
That would mean an increased burden on the families of the elderly in care,
which the report estimates at between Pounds 30 and Pounds 40 a week. Social
security would also need to pay more, and the report estimates the cost to
the taxpayer of supporting elderly people in private care at close to Pounds
2bn this year.
Elderly people are the main consumers of health services, with those aged 85
and over costing the National Health Service and community services an
average of five times as much as those aged between five and 64, according
to Mr Francis McGlone, author of the report.
The FSPC study adds to a report by Nuffield College, Oxford, published this
year, which estimated that houses to the value of Pounds 2.5bn were sold
each year to pay for long-term care.
According to the Nuffield report, nearly two thirds of those who owned their
homes when they went into long-term care needed to sell them to pay the
bills.
Over the past year, several large insurance companies, including Commercial
Union, Eagle Star and Private Patients Plan, have launched insurance
policies aimed at paying for long-term care.
A wide-ranging public debate is needed to establish the extent to which
families should take responsibility for dependent relatives, a report says
today, Alan Pike writes.
The report, by Professor Anthea Tinker and colleagues at the Age Concern
Institute of Gerontology at King's College, London, says examination of the
extent of the state's responsibility for care of the elderly should be
informed by overseas experience, including the German system where adult
sons and daughters had some legal responsibility for dependent parents.
About 6m people in Britain care for dependents. The report says carers risk
having low incomes in retirement because of lost employment opportunities.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Row erupts over Lawson book
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORY PARTY was haunted by the spirit of crisis past as well as crisis
present this weekend as a fresh row erupted between former cabinet ministers
over discussions seven years ago about whether sterling should join the
exchange rate mechanism.
The dispute centres on Lord Lawson's book about his time as chancellor, and
in particular his recollection that Lord Tebbit, now a leading Euro-sceptic,
expressed support for the UK's entry into the ERM in November 1985 while he
was party chairman. Lord Tebbit fiercely denies the charge.
Describing a meeting convened by Mrs Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher, Lord
Lawson writes that Lord Tebbit said 'that he would be in favour if I thought
it would be helpful economically; and added that he felt it would be easy to
carry the party'.
In response to that version of the meeting in the Telegraph's serialisation
of Lord Lawson's memoirs, Lord Tebbit insisted that the claim was wrong,
explaining: 'Loyal as I was to the prime minister, I was naturally reluctant
to put the boot in against a chancellor who argued for a policy change
within his departmental responsibilities.'
He said that if Mrs Thatcher had been isolated on the question of the UK's
membership of the ERM in 1985, she would not have been able to withstand for
five years, as she did, the pressure for sterling to join.
The former chancellor's picture of an ashen-faced Mr John Major wondering if
he was equal to the job when he first became Treasury chief secretary in
1987 is also likely to cause irritation in the party.
'For a time after the 1987 general election, I was concerned that I might
have made the wrong choice of chief secretary after all - a view I suspect
was shared by John Major himself,' Lord Lawson writes.
'He found the job far more difficult than anything he had done before and
had to work very hard to try to master it. He would come and see me at
Number 11 (Downing Street), ashen-faced, to unburden himself of his
worries.'

FT  05 OCT 92 / Abolition of wages councils urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOLITION of the remaining wages councils and privatisation of the
government conciliation service Acas are being urged on the eve of the
Conservative Party conference by the Institute of Direct-ors.
The government said earlier this year it saw no 'permanent place' for wages
councils, which at present set minimum rates for about 10 per cent of the
working population. There has been speculation that their abolition would be
included in this autumn's employment bill.
Some campaigners against abolition believe that Mrs Gillian Shephard, the
employment secretary, will announce the winding up of the councils at the
Conservative conference this week.
The belief is based partly on a hostile response from the Department of
Employment to a recent letter from the Equal Opportunities Commission urging
retention of the councils in the interests of women, who make up nearly 2m
of the 2.5m people covered by the councils. The department pointed out that
most of the low-paid live in households with other incomes and are not poor.
The Trades Union Congress will be lobbying delegates to the Conservative
conference in Brighton today. The TUC argues that abolition of the wages
councils will push thousands of people below the poverty line and points to
a recent NOP survey which found that nine out of 10 people support
protection for people on low pay.
Supporting abolition of the 26 remaining wages councils - mainly covering
service industries such as hotels and restaurants - the IoD argues that the
councils, far from protecting workers, constitute a bureaucratic
intervention in the labour market that is especially onerous on businesses
employing fewer than 50 people.
The IoD is also calling for the abolition of the licensing of employment
agencies and for measures to ensure equal tax treatment of employees and the
self-employed. The present system of licensing employment agencies, the IoD
says, does not appear to provide any genuine protection for those using
them, but the cost of compliance imposes an excessive burden on business.
'These measures will encourage labour market flexibility and contribute to
British industry's recovery from recession,' said Dr Ann Robinson, head of
the IoD policy unit.

<TEXT>
ORDERS, deliveries and confidence in the West Midlands 'took a nosedive'
between July and September, Mr Andrew Millward, chairman of the West
Midlands regional group of Chambers of Commerce, said.
Mr Millward, commenting on the chambers' latest quarterly economic survey,
said, 'The post-election euphoria disappeared as companies realised the
recession was deepening. The events of the past few weeks have made the
picture even more unclear.'
The survey, covering 700 companies in both the manufacturing and services
sectors of the region and published today, took place shortly before
sterling was taken out of the ERM.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Tories air differences on economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAGREEMENTS among senior Conservatives about the harsh medicine needed to
survive the present economic turmoil surfaced yesterday. Lord Parkinson, who
as Mr Cecil Parkinson served in the Thatcher cabinet, said the priority
should be to restrain interest rates rather than taxes in order to protect
capital spending programmes.
'The last thing our economy needs at the moment is higher interest rates,'
he said on BBC radio. 'If another price has to be paid as part of the price
of getting them down I would be prepared to pay that.
'As part of getting interest rates down, giving the economy a boost and
maintaining the capital programmes in the public expenditure programme, I
would be prepared to see a levy of some kind that would put up taxes.'
He spoke as senior ministers strove to dispel fears that tax increases might
be used as an escape route from the present economic difficulties. They
emphasised that, outside the ERM, control of public spending was even more
important than before in ensuring that the government's anti-inflationary
strategy carried credibility.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said the government would not leave
sterling in free fall, and emphasised the need to bring stability back to
the pound's exchange rates as soon as possible.
Mr Clarke signalled that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would be prepared
to raise interest rates if the pound continued its fall. He was joined in
his efforts to calm nervousness in the money markets about the direction of
economic policy by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, who
said that raising taxes was the 'least attractive course' open to the
government.
Worry in the markets at the prospect that details of the new basis for
economic policy might not be disclosed until the chancellor's Mansion House
speech at the end of this month has contributed to the decision that Mr
Lamont should use his speech on Thursday to the Tory party conference and
his appearance in front of the all-party Treasury committee of MPs a week
today to chart the way forward.
Mr Clarke said on BBC television that the government's duty was to have a
monetary and fiscal policy that gave traders stability. He also indicated,
however, that he did not believe it was yet possible to know what exchange
rate would be sustainable.
Brushing aside the Anglo-German row about the circumstances of sterling's
suspension from the ERM, he insisted that the relationship between the two
countries was still good.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Spain tells leaders to focus on EC unity at summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN has called on European Community leaders meeting at next week's
Birmingham summit to focus on restoring EC political unity rather than
become bogged down in debate over the exchange rate mechanism.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez
warned: 'Birmingham will have to give a clear signal that the 12 members,
beyond what our individual problems might be, have common interests and are
prepared to say so - I was going to say in a friendly way, but even that is
not necessary.'
Madrid is concerned that political and technical divisions between Germany
and Britain, which has the EC presidency until the end of the year, might
spill over into the summit.
It is also worried that currency speculators might view anything less than a
firm renewal of EC political commitment to the economic and political
objectives of the Maastricht treaty as a further opportunity to attack the
ERM's weaker currencies.
The Spanish leader did not believe Britain's presidency of the EC during the
currency turmoil had been deficient.
'There has been a lack of co-ordination. . . perhaps a lack of leadership,'
he said, 'but we leaders are, all of us, responsible for it. We have made
the mistake of renationalising our political attitudes when it is clearer
than ever that interdependence has increased.'
Spain may raise its official interest rate from 13 per cent this week to
match demand for higher yields on the public debt it needs to issue to raise
about Dollars 17bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in new deficit financing by the end of the
year.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Sterling to dominate markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORTUNES of sterling will this week dominate UK financial markets where
confidence that UK base rates can be reduced to 8 per cent by the year-end
has been badly shaken by the renewed weakness of the pound.
Predictions from many City analysts that base rates might be cut by a
further one point from their present 9 per cent level to coincide with the
Conservative party conference were effectively withdrawn on Friday afternoon
when the pound appeared close to free fall.
The Bundesbank's decision that day to leave German rates unchanged is likely
to keep sterling under pressure.
The expected political tensions at the conference will also increase
uncertainty in a stock market still seeking clarification of the
government's economic strategy after sterling's departure from the exchange
rate mechanism.
The retail price index for August, due on Friday, is expected to show a
continued moderation in inflationary pressures, according to Brian Hilliard
at stockbroker Strauss Turnbull.
The dollar opened in Tokyo this morning at a historic low of Y118.93.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Major ready to postpone debate on ERM reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has signalled he is ready to shelve debate on Britain's demand
for reform of the European exchange rate mechanism until after this month's
emergency summit in Birmingham.
The prime minister's stance, set out in a confidential letter sent to fellow
EC leaders, reflects his acceptance of other governments' fears that public
discussion of changes might add to the mechanism's present strains.
The emergence of Mr Major's letter coincided yesterday with a determined
ministerial campaign to prevent this week's Conservative conference from
degenerating into a civil war over the Maastricht treaty.
In an interview with the FT, Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman, warned
opponents of Maastricht in the Tory party that Mr Major and his entire
cabinet will 'come out fighting' to ensure that it gets through the House of
Commons. That message will be repeated throughout the week by a succession
of cabinet ministers.
But a warning by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, that sterling's
recent slide could not be allowed to continue indefinitely reinforced fears
among nervous Tory MPs that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, could be
forced to raise interest rates.
Mr Lamont, who is preparing for a crucial speech to the party conference on
Thursday, has said he would if necessary reverse the one percentage point
cut which followed sterling's departure from the ERM. But an increase now
could undermine fatally his position in the cabinet.
Mr Clarke was echoed by Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
in a reminder to party activists who gather in Brighton tomorrow that the
pound's devaluation will mean tougher controls on public spending. Alongside
sharp cutbacks already agreed in capital spending on transport, schools,
hospital and prison building, the Treasury now wants a cash reduction in the
health service budget and a freeze in some social security benefits.
As some ministers call for a public sector pay freeze rather than further
reductions in capital programmes, Mr Lamont is expected to chair another
meeting of the cabinet's public spending committee later today.
Mr Heseltine, however, sought to dispel suggestions that the government is
considering raising income tax to reduce a public sector deficit forecast at
more than Pounds 40bn next year. In private, ministers will not rule out an
extension of value added tax to areas such as domestic fuel and newspapers,
but Mr Heseltine described the option of higher taxes as 'the least
attractive to a Conservative government'.
Mr Major's acknowledgment that there can be no immediate changes in the ERM
came in the letter sent out to his European counterparts at the end of last
week. In his role as the current EC president, he had wanted finance
ministers to review the ERM's working at the Birmingham summit on October
16.
But the letter said he now accepted that several other governments objected
to the attendance of finance ministers.
Instead the summit would discuss generally the recent turbulence on the
financial markets based on an interim report by the Community's monetary
committee.
But most of the leaders' attention will be devoted to drafting a proposed
declaration to give substance to the principle of subsidiarity  - the
decentralisation of decision-making in the EC.
Mr Major believes there is much greater impetus behind his demand for repair
of the 'fault-lines' in the ERM than is publicly acknowledged by many
governments.
But the prime minister acknowledges that those governments whose currencies
have been under speculative attack, including France, cannot afford to admit
publicly that the mechanism is fundamentally flawed.
The pressures on Mr Major were highlighted yesterday by two opinion polls on
his performance as premier.
The 33 per cent satisfaction rating found by Mori for The Sunday Times, and
the 34 per cent satisfaction rating according to Gallup in The Sunday
Telegraph are both sharply down on Mr Major's previous scores. A further
Mori poll for The Times today suggests 68 per cent would have voted against
ratification of the Maastricht treaty if a referendum were held.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Go to Tokyo for a Pounds 2,840 saving on UK-built Nissan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent, ROBERT THOMSON and CHRIS
TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO, SUNDERLAND
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A JAPANESE car made in Sunderland and shipped 10,600 miles to Japan costs
Pounds 2,840 less in Tokyo than a similar model for sale a few hundred yards
from the Nissan plant in the north-east of England.
The car buyer in Sunderland wanting a new Nissan Primera eGT, built at the
Japanese car maker's Pounds 900m car plant close to the town, could drive it
away from the nearby dealer, Reg Vardy, for Pounds 16,215.
The racy-looking hatchback is black (a Pounds 120 option) and has air
conditioning (a Pounds 795 option) to bring it up to the same equipment
level as the car on sale in Tokyo. It also has front and rear spoilers.
In Tokyo, a similar Primera eGT is on sale in the Kudan showroom of the
Nissan Prince Tokyo Sales Company priced at Y2,788,675 (Pounds 13,375),
Pounds 2,840 less than in the UK.
Sunderland is the only Nissan plant which makes this model.
Before the steep decline of sterling after its withdrawal from the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System the Tokyo price was
equivalent to only Pounds 11,994.
The cars' varying equipment levels - a favourite justification for car price
differences around the world - are not enough to explain the divergence in
this example.
The Sunderland buyer gets an electric sun roof (not available in Japan) but
the Tokyo buyer gets automatic transmission, a Pounds 750 option in the UK.
The prices quoted above include the discounts that may be negotiated from
dealers - 11.7 per cent at Sunderland's Reg Vardy, and 6.0 per cent at
Tokyo's Nissan Prince.
Taxes are another big variable. Higher taxes in the UK have certainly
inflated the price paid by the Sunderland car buyer - but not by enough to
close the gap.
Excluding tax, the price in Tokyo would still be Pounds 1,680 less than in
the UK - Pounds 11,490 versus Pounds 13,170.
Last week a study by Ludvigsen Associates, the UK-based automotive analysts,
claimed European car buyers paid as much as 30 per cent more for new cars
than consumers in the US and Japan.
The Ludvigsen report said inefficiencies in the European motor industry were
one of the basic reasons for this difference in prices.
Nissan, which pioneered Japanese car production in Europe with its UK plant,
says there are 'many factors' behind the price differences but 'the most
important is the overall pricing in the particular market.
'New car prices in Japan are relatively low because during the years of
consistent growth in demand manufacturers have been able to offset increased
costs against rising production volumes.
'Prices have consistently risen at less than the rate of inflation. Japanese
inflation has been between 2 per cent and 3 per cent for a number of years.
'By contrast the market leaders in the UK, which are also necessarily the
price leaders, have in many years raised prices by more than the rate of
inflation.
'This has inevitably caused the general pricing level in the two markets to
widen.'

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey of Technology in the Office (1): Paperless dream
still tantalises - New hardware and software offer fresh opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ever since the first personal computers began turning up on office desktops
more than a decade ago, the prospect of a paperless, automated and
super-productive office of the future has remained tantalisingly just out of
reach.
Despite the advent of office technology, about 95 per cent of information
used in the office is still stored on paper rather than electronically.
Indeed, far from dispensing with paper, office workers are handling
increasingly larger volumes of it.
At one organisation interviewed as part of a recent UK study* by management
consultants Touche Ross, the 2,000 staff dealt with 45 tonnes of incoming
mail last year, and 48 tonnes of outgoing mail - equivalent to generating
25kg of paper per person.
The Touche Ross study of information management revealed that although 70
per cent of organisations believed they had too much paper (which they
generated themselves), the same organisations listed their most significant
problem as not having enough space to store their records.
The report also showed that through poor management of records, companies
are starved of information. Between 40 and 70 per cent of staff lack
sufficient information to do their jobs properly. The remainder tend to have
too little rather than too much.
'We conducted the survey to confirm our belief that businesses are suffering
costs by not managing information successfully,' said Mr David Best, a
partner at Touche Ross and a leading expert on information management. 'We
know that there are significant benefits to be achieved and we wanted to see
if we could identify them and any of the pitfalls encountered along the
way.'
'Our findings show that a high percentage of information is paper-based and
almost one quarter of organisations have no standards and procedures for
dealing with it,' said Julia Parsons, co-author of the report. 'Management
rarely sees paper-based information as a complementary buildingblock to
information held in computer systems, and so it does not manage it in an
integrated fashion.'
Nevertheless, the study also revealed a dramatic growth in the use of
electronic data, even though there is a long way to go before people give up
the 'comfort' of paper. There is also a definite trend towards optical
storage although 'there is no corresponding rapid decrease in the use of
paper,' said Ms Parsons.
It is perhaps the failure of organisations to view, plan and monitor the
office process in its entirety which possibly explains some of the
disappointment and disillusionment with office automation most often
expressed by those who have funded it.
In the past this has often led to the piecemeal purchase of a higher quality
photocopier, faster printer or new PC, but a failure to automate the whole
process. As a result, the basic flow of information through an organisation
actually changes very little and predictably this unco-ordinated approach
has frequently failed to deliver the hoped-for efficiency and productivity
gains.
But it is only relatively recently that all the building blocks for a truly
integrated digital office have begun to fall into place.
New hardware such as digital optical scanning, storage and retrieval devices
and CD-ROM have appeared along with other new technologies such as digital
cordless telephony, desktop video-conferencing and software applications
such as electronic mail and voice mail systems for networked PCs. This new
hardware and software is now beginning to open up new possibilities for
integrating systems and streamlining procedures.
In one area alone - that of wireless office telephone lines - the
productivity gains and potential savings could be substantial. As a result,
the Washington-based consultancy EMCI estimates that by 1996 France,
Germany, Italy and the UK will have installed 6.4m wireless office telephone
lines.
There is also a growing awareness of the advantages of other wireless data
communications systems such as wireless local area networks (Lans), and of
electronic data interchange (EDI) which can remove the need to send and
receive standard paper forms such as invoices, orders and bills.
Similarly it is now possible to bring together previously unconnected pieces
of electronic hardware. For example, multifunction digital devices which
combine some or all of the features of a fax machine, scanner, photocopier
and laser printer have begun to appear. High-volume electronic demand
printers which link directly to computers are now available, as are digital
copiers which scan a hard copy once before reproducing multiple copies.
Fax and other communications functions are being built into PCs and office
networks, removing the need for paper print-outs entirely. Desktop
video-conferencing using a card plugged into a PC is also already possible
and may in time reduce the need to travel to meetings.
Meanwhile multimedia systems enable text, computer graphics, full-colour
photographs, moving video and sound to be combined and have applications in
sales, training and internal communications.
As the digital office becomes a real technological possibility, equipment
suppliers are increasingly focusing on their core expertise. But they are
also forming loose partnerships and working in collaboration with each other
to combine technologies and provide more effective 'solutions' for the
marketplace.
This trend is illustrated by Kodak's list of development partners. Kodak is
applying its imaging technology expertise with Novell in networking
software, IBM and Apple in computer hardware, Digital Equipment in open
systems, Lotus for certain PC software and with Adobe which has incorporated
Kodak's Photo YCC colour image standard in its latest Postscript Level 2
page description language.
The availability of various digital technologies which need to be integrated
is only one of the issues that management consultants believe needs to be
addressed if office productivity is to be improved. Another is whether the
management structures in organisations have developed to complement the
available technology? In many companies, responsibility for different pieces
of equipment will lie with separate departments. But it is generally
accepted that in order to implement and operate an integrated strategy it is
necessary to put someone in charge of office automation as a whole, rather
than maintaining distinct roles for the data processing manager, the
information technology manager and others.
One reason for identifying someone as responsible for office automation is
that he or she will also need to consider other factors, not least the
office environment itself. The quality of the office environment is an
increasingly 'hot' issue for equipment manufactures and employers.
Legislative requirements are steadily being tightened, a process which is
often being spearheaded by the European Commission. Over
the past two years, the Commission has issued several directives aimed at
providing a framework of minimum standards for ergonomics and office health
and safety.
These directives, which include provisions on computer hardware, software,
furniture and the office environment, are due to become law in all member
states this year.
Manufactures such as ICL, the UK computer group which is owned by Japan's
Fujitsu, have seized upon the growing awareness of ergonomics and
environmental health issues as a marketing opportunity. Following its
acquisition of Scandinavia's Nokia Data, ICL is now marketing a range of PCs
which already meet or exceed all the EC requirements.
'Ergonomics is no longer a fad or a fashion,' said Mr Philip Vanhautte,
vice-president for marketing and customer concerns at ICL Personal Systems.
Instead, he says, it has moved into the mainstream.
What ICL has identified is that automation of the office is about much more
than just providing the equipment. Critically, it requires the co-operation
of people and a structured plan for improving all aspects of the office
environment, not just the volume of paper processed.
Perhaps, therefore, the paperless office is a dream best forgotten, or at
least put to one side for the moment. As Shirley Murray of Touche Ross
conceded: 'The survey clearly shows that paper will be with us for at least
the next decade. The majority of organisations do not yet appreciate the
value of managing information as a resource, nor the benefits to be achieved
by doing so.'
There are indications, however, that the tough economic conditions of the
past few years have prompted organisations to pay more attention to managing
their businesses more effectively.
'The key to success,' says Ms Murray, 'is a deeper understanding of their
business and the flow of information throughout the organisation, and

FT  05 OCT 92 / Monday Interview: The sure touch of a survivor - Sir Norman
Fowler, the Conservative party chairman, talks to Philip Stephens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Norman Fowler is one of the great survivors of Conservative politics. As
others who sat around Mrs Margaret Thatcher's first cabinet table in 1979
squabble from the House of Lords over how an economic miracle shattered into
a mirage, Sir Norman is among those still trying to pick up the pieces.
Now Conservative party chairman, he left the cabinet in January 1990,
telling Mrs Thatcher that after nearly 11 years he wanted to spend more time
with his family. Mr John Major's move into Downing Street 10 months later
persuaded him that that he had time still for politics. By the end of this
week he may be forgiven for having third thoughts.
When he moved into Smith Square last April Sir Norman saw his principal role
as a peacetime chairman who would overhaul the creaking structures of a
party which wins elections despite its campaigning skills, rather than
because of them.
That remains a priority. Within the next few months he will announce the
most fundamental reform of his party's organisation for 40 years. It will
weld together the disparate wings into a single board of directors and begin
to whittle down a Pounds 10m overdraft.
But his energies this week in Brighton will be absorbed by the latest bloody
episode in the Tory civil war over Europe. His job will be to rally the
support of grass-roots activists for Mr Major over the Maastricht treaty; to
persuade them that images of Mr Norman Lamont should be cast from their
minds when they issue the traditional call for the return of capital
punishment; and to ensure the now Lady Thatcher is silent.
Sir Norman, who has no department of his own but sits in on the cabinet's
political discussions, is one of the pivotal figures in Mr Major's effort to
regain a grip. Rooted in the same Tory centre-ground as the prime minister,
his job is to offer the soothing reassurance which has made him a master in
the art of lowering the political temperature.
The party's footsoldiers are feeling bewildered and betrayed. Six months ago
they anticipated a celebration in Brighton of their fourth consecutive
election victory. That hope was shattered in a few hours on September 16
when the City of London's young men in braces kicked away the central plank
of the prime minister's economic and foreign policies.
Instead of economic recovery, there is continued recession; instead of unity
on Europe, there is open warfare. The prime minister who promised he would
never devalue has done just that - by a whacking 18 per cent.
Sir Norman, of course, does not quite see it like that. The Man from Middle
England, whose sureness of political touch saw him emerge unscathed from
some of the most difficult posts in a Tory cabinet, emphasises that Mr Major
will fight.
He applauds last Thursday's decision by the cabinet to begin to fill the
vacuum left by sterling's ignominious departure from the European exchange
rate mechanism by pressing ahead with ratification of Maastricht. The
activists need leadership.
Sir Norman omits to add that last week he pressed the prime minister as hard
as anyone to demonstrate that leadership before - rather than after - this
week's conference. 'My own view is that the centre of the party backs John
Major's stand, backs his negotiating skills . . . and are also in a sense
delighted that he has come out fighting.'
The theme crops up again and again during a 40-minute interview. If the Tory
party in the country gets clear leadership, its activists will respond: 'One
of the messages of this conference is that this is a time when the party is
under attack. . . . We recognise that . . . but it is also a time when we
will signal very clearly that we are fighting back'.
Left unspoken is the thought that the most threatening assault comes not
from the Labour party but from the Euro-sceptics in the Tory party. Lady
Thatcher, Lord Tebbit, Lord Ridley and 50 or more of their acolytes on the
Conservative backbenches in the Commons look far more threatening than that
nice pro-European Mr John Smith.
After signs of cabinet divisions over whether Mr Major should drop
Maastricht, the party chairman is determined to get one point across - every
single cabinet minister had signed up to ratification.
Last week's decision to press forward with Maastricht followed a 'discussion
around the cabinet table, the political cabinet, in which most ministers -
almost all - took part and in which everyone was agreed that this was the
way forward'.
There is then a gentle warning to his colleagues as well to the
Euro-sceptics: 'I think opponents of this course should actually take note
of that (agreement). Because there are not going to be people going behind
and saying, 'Well, actually it has nothing to do with me. We believe in
something else.' That isn't going to happen.'
Mr Michael Portillo, Mr Peter Lilley, Mr Michael Howard and Mr Lamont - the
least enthusiastic Europeans in the cabinet - have been forewarned.
Sir Norman has persuaded Lady Thatcher that she should reserve her next
onslaught on Maastricht for a more suitable occasion. He spoke at length to
her 10 days ago and agreed that she should step on to the platform alongside
Mr Major on Thursday morning just before Mr Lamont's speech.
The Lady is unpredictable, but Sir Norman seems confident enough that she
will stick to a silent part: 'I had a long talk with Margaret. . . . She was
in tremendously good form. What she said was that she wanted things to
happen as normally as they could. But the party conference will want to make
a fuss of her and rightly so.'
But what about the economy? Constituency parties after all are crammed with
small-business owners, who have been among the worst hit by the recession.
For two years Mr Lamont told them the pain of the ERM would bring its
rewards in stable prices and renewed growth. Neither are in sight, and the
attempt to hold the exchange rate has been abandoned.
Sir Norman opens up the tap of reassurance: 'I think what one says is what
the truthful position is. It was the right decision to go into the ERM. But
given the totally tumultuous circumstances that we faced at the time it was
right to suspend our membership'.
But surely the representatives (there are no delegates in the Tory party)
will want to know whether the government still has an economic policy? 'What
the chancellor I'm sure will be spelling out is that, whether we are in the
ERM or not, what matters is the underlying policy of, for example, the
control of inflation and the control of public spending.'
Neither will be easy and this year's spending round is proving particularly
rough: 'Any government department has to act within the confines of what the
nation can afford,' says Sir Norman. The implication is that the
Conservatives can no longer guarantee to meet the manifesto pledges they
offered to the electorate only six months ago.
Sir Norman moves on for the remaining minutes to his other role,
acknowledging in effect that Tory party finances are in as bad a state as
the nation's: 'We have an overdraft of over Pounds 10m. That is an absurd
position for this party to be in'.
Popular myth has it that the party is a gleaming, well-oiled machine, the
Rolls Royce of British politics. In fact, local constituency parties -
independent of Smith Square and represented by a separate National
Association - are frequently at war with Sir Norman's empire in London.
Many associations refuse to hand over any money to the central office,
accusing Smith Square of waste and mismanagement. A group of 50
constituencies have demanded an emergency meeting of the umbrella Central
Council to force through the 'democratisation' of the party's organisation.
The chairman hopes to outflank the critics by putting representatives of all
wings of the party on his new executive boards and by introducing a modicum
of transparency into the central office's notoriously secretive accounts. He
has chosen a finance director, and the other newly created post of chief
executive should be filled by the end of this year. That, of course, is if
Sir Norman is not gripped by an overwhelming desire to spend more time with
his family after a week of civil war in Brighton.

FT  05 OCT 92 / The risk of a triple dip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President George Bush hailed the marginal decline in unemployment last month
as a sign that the economy was on the mend. He was grasping at straws. The
jobless rate fell only because the labour force shrank faster than
employment; it was not a sign of strength. Recent economic data, in fact,
are quite alarming - the economy appears to be losing what little momentum
it had during the summer. On Wall Street there is even talk of a 'triple
dip' recession.
This will irritate many optimists who deny that the economy ever suffered a
second dip. Gross domestic product has grown every quarter (albeit very
sluggishly) since the spring of last year when the contraction phase of the
recession ended. But the economy most definitely dipped late last year; a
host of indicators - including employment and industrial production -
declined sharply, prompting the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates by a
full point in an effort to revive confidence. For a while, the stimulus
appeared to work wonders; consumer spending surged in the first quarter of
this year, prompting an increase in production and some rebuilding of
corporate inventories.
The ever-sanguine US forecasting fraternity promptly assumed that the
'recovery' was finally underway. The previous year's forecasts of 3 per cent
growth were dusted off and issued as 1992 projections. Yet it has become
apparent that something is amiss. Consumer spending ran ahead of incomes and
did not generate enough new employment to become self-sustaining. By
mid-year it was clear that the economy was growing at an annual rate of only
about 1.5 per cent; consumer confidence, meanwhile, was again beginning to
erode. With the outlook for exports also deteriorating because of depressed
markets in Europe and Japan, business confidence began to wobble. Instead of
hiring, companies began firing, further undermining consumer confidence.
The upshot is that the economy is now in almost as fragile a condition as
this time last year. GDP appears to have grown in the third quarter, but at
a declining rate. The employment figures released on Friday were a catalogue
of woe for the second month running. Non-farm payroll employment declined
57,000 last month and figures for August were revised sharply down to show a
decline of 128,000. After allowing for the distorting effects of the federal
summer jobs programme, employment has registered an average monthly decline
of about 19,000 for the past three months, marking a sharp break with the
modest gains recorded in the second quarter. The average work week also
contracted, indicating further pressure on personal incomes.
Nearly every recent economic statistic has been significantly weaker than
predicted. But the biggest shock was delivered last week by the nation's
purchasing managers - unsung executives whose collective ear tends to be
close to the ground. The Purchasing Managers' Index, a barometer of
conditions in manufacturing industry, plunged last month, falling below 50
per cent for the first time since January when the economy was recovering
from a second dip. Readings below 50 per cent indicate the manufacturing
sector is contracting. The sharp fall, moreover, mainly reflected a collapse
in the component of the index measuring corporate order books; historically
this has been one of the more accurate leading indicators.
The housing and construction industries, normally the first to benefit from
lower interest rates, are also flashing amber. Home sales and construction
outlays have fallen sharply recently despite the lowest interest rates for
nearly three decades. Analysts are alarmed by signs that non-residential
construction is again collapsing, having appeared to stabilise earlier this
year. With corporate giants such as IBM announcing big staff cutbacks, an
early firming of demand for office space, which remains in chronic excess
supply in nearly every American city, seems improbable.
The economic outlook is much worse than most forecasters - certainly the
White House - ever envisaged. But it would be wrong to exaggerate the risks.
If a triple dip materialises at all, it is likely to be similar to last
year's mini-downturn - a stalling of growth in which some, but not all,
sectors and regions slip temporarily into recession.
But even this degree of discomfort may be avoided if the Fed opts to cut
interest rates again after next week's meeting of governors and regional
presidents. The betting on Wall Street is that interest rates will be
reduced, despite the risks of turbulence in foreign exchange markets and the
proximity of a presidential election. At the margin this will help revive
confidence, although it is hard to see the current level of rates as a
binding constraint on economic growth. The odds that a new president will
authorise a fiscal stimulus next spring have also shortened, although it is
far less clear that additional borrowing would offer net benefits.
The 3 per cent growth forecasts that keep surfacing will eventually be
vindicated, but only when structural factors depressing the economy, such as
high consumer and corporate debt ratios, glutted real estate markets, and
the secular decline in defence spending, have loosened their grip. How long
the adjustment will take is still anybody's guess. In the meantime the
economy is likely to make erratic progress.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Major's moment of truth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major's decision to bring the Maastricht treaty back to parliament
within the next few months means that he knows the moment of truth cannot be
postponed any longer.
In the end there could be no alternative to a decisive trial of strength
between the prime minister and the Euro-rebels, and sooner must be better
than later, because the mere passage of time could only make his position
weaker still.
He has no option but to put the question to the test, because failure to
ratify the Maastricht treaty would mean the ruin of his political
credibility at home, and the ruin of Britain's credibility in the Community.
Until last Thursday procrastination and evasion might have seemed looked
like a safer policy; but in reality it would just have been a slower and
more insidious road to the same sort of ruin.
The consequence would be that the UK would be marginalised when the other
member states then started to discuss between themselves - as they
undoubtedly would - alternative arrangements.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois Mitterrand have recently
stressed their continued commitment to the existing 12-nation Community. No
doubt that is what they would prefer; but if the Maastricht treaty were to
fall in Britain, there is no chance that the other member states would sit
with their hands folded, waiting for something to turn up.
Mr Major has now set himself a shorter deadline, because he knows the
patience of Paris and Bonn is strictly finite; and that is because President
Mitterrand has very little usable time left. The Elysee Palace claims that
his prostate cancer is not dangerous; but he is surely having treatment for
it, and cancer treatment is always exhausting, especially for a man of 75.
More important, Mr Mitterrand is running out of political road. The general
elections next March are likely to see bring a very heavy defeat for the
president's Socialist party and a sweeping conservative victory. In the
normal course of events, this probably means a conservative government led
by the Gaullists; but while the Gaullist leadership campaigned in favour of
Maastricht, a large majority of its followers voted against. There are some
advance murmurings that the conservatives' victory could be so large that
they might be able to force the president out of office. Either way the
president's European policy will be in jeopardy. If he wants to keep the
Maastricht treaty on the rails, or look for some alternative, he needs to
know how things stand very soon.
Mr Major's domestic pretext for going into battle for the Maastricht treaty
is that he believes he will be able to claim important improvements in the
way the treaty will operate. Among other things, he expects to get a piece
of paper agreed at the Birmingham summit which will put strict limits on
gratuitous interference by the Brussels institutions. Specifically, this
should clarify and strengthen the principle of 'subsidiarity', by which the
Community should not intervene in matters which can be better handled in the
member states.
The problem with this so-called 'Birmingham declaration' is not just that it
is bound to be juridically ambiguous, but that it is transparently intended
to deceive. Britain and others are trying to blame the Commission for the
current wave of popular anti-Community sentiment, which surfaced in the
French referendum. But to pretend that the Commission has grabbed power from
the member states to satisfy the overweening centralist ambitions of Jacques
Delors is deliberate and shameless misrepresentation.
The Commission does not deserve to be idealised. It is no doubt
bureaucratic, self-satisfied and incompetent; but it is no more
bureaucratic, self-satisfied and incompetent than the British Treasury, or
indeed any Whitehall department. The fundamental point is that the
Commission has no powers except those given by the member states; and the
attempt to make it a general scapegoat for the present malaise is grotesque.
If the government serves up this kind of deception as its primary life-line
to ratification, it is obviously in deep psychological trouble. Last
Thursday Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, gave a speech which was
meant to be a strong defence of the Maastricht treaty. Unfortunately, it
showed that the government does not really like any part of the treaty; not
European monetary union, nor a common foreign policy, nor powers for the
European Parliament, nor the social charter, nor immigration and justice -
nothing.
Instead, Mr Hurd claimed that the treaty would make it easier to enlarge the
Community, to conclude the Uruguay Round, implement the single market and
reform the agricultural policy. Alas, all these fall-back claims are simply
untrue.
If the Hurd speech gives a true picture of what the government collectively
thinks about Maastricht, then it almost certainly cannot push the treaty
through the House of Commons.
It is one thing to make an appointment with fate. It is quite another to
muster the spiritual intensity to win over the waverers and cow the rebels.
This government does not like the treaty which it described a bare 10 months
ago as a triumph for Britain, and it shows.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on the Fed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange dealers will keep a close eye on tomorrow's Federal Open
Market Committee, in the belief that there could be a cut in the US discount
rate, writes James Blitz.
Last Friday's non-farm payroll figure for September came in slightly better
than expected, with a monthly drop of 57,000. However, the underlying gloom
about the US economy remains, and, in the view of Mr Gerard Lyons, Chief
Economist at DKB International in London, there is a 'better than even'
chance of the Fed easing the discount rate below 3 per cent.
Late on Friday, US dealers seemed to be coming to this view as the dollar
traded at around DM1.4075 against the D-Mark, after peaking at DM1.4360
shortly after the payroll report was released.
The Bundesbank made clear last week that another cut in German short term
rates was unlikely to materialise for several months, and a Fed cut would
widen the differential between US and German short term rates, which is
currently at 6.5 per cent.
Otherwise, the market's focus is likely to be on sterling. The currency
enters its third full week of free floating today and the experience thus
far has been miserable. Last week, the currency fell 12.5 pfennigs against
the D-Mark in the absence of a clear statement of economic policy from the
UK government. In Mr Lyons' view, sterling is 'sick.'
Dealers will be looking for some policy lead at the Conservative party
conference in Brighton this week, but they are unlikely to get it. If there
is no clear statement from the chancellor when he addresses conference on
Wednesday or the Treasury Select Committee next Monday, the market will have
to wait until the Mansion house speech on October 29.

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Capital Markets: Departures that are overdue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE contemptuous downgrading of sterling on Friday was a continuous vote of
no confidence in the British government, confirmed by every whinge to be
heard from Whitehall. Everyone was in favour of our policy; it was the
speculators; it was them, not us; nobody told us; everybody got their
forecasts wrong; it could have happened to anyone . . . and a pfennig or
more for each pathetic thought.
Pathetic is indeed too kind a term; for these are all untruths. Signs of
trouble were everywhere. German fears about the level of sterling were
public from the first day. The whole market was expecting a crisis around
the French referendum; and after the lira devaluation it was prudence, not
speculation, to go short of suspect currencies. The authorities could have
heard warnings in any City bar.
There were also plenty of longer-term warnings. Not only from Sir Alan
Walters (surely Mr Major can remember him?) and the Liverpool Six, but from
Professor Wynne Godley in Cambridge and from a number of City economists. It
is not even true that nobody in the Treasury or the Bank of England gave
timely warnings. All of them were simply ignored.
The prime minister may have imagined that he was following the example of
Lady Thatcher in this 'not one of us' attitude to dissent, though she was
far more pragmatic. It led directly to what is a disaster without precedent:
a government caught not only with a discredited policy, which is common
enough, but with no contingency plans for trouble. It is this failure which
continues to undermine confidence.
Until the government appears to be coming to grips with reality, it can
expect neither to make a success of floating, nor to be welcomed back into
the comfortless shelter of the ERM. We lack even the basis of a policy.
Meanwhile, talk of long-term objectives - low inflation, or tax cuts, or a
place at the heart of Europe - is simply fantasising.
The government wants to be seen as serious: it must first show that it is
seeking to understand rather than to excuse what went wrong. It started a
long time ago. There has been no sign that anyone in the Treasury has at any
time understood the consequences of the disastrous Lawson credit inflation,
and the Bank's warnings were ignored. This left the economy too weakened by
debt to withstand the rigours of a Bundesbank policy even in normal times,
let alone in a reunification crisis. Hence the stream of cloud-cuckoo
forecasts.
And the same officials were not only unaware in advance that the ERM
exchange rate was over-valued; they continue to deny it. There is no space
here to go in to the sloppy theory behind this obstinacy. It is enough for
the moment to say that you cannot hope to impress the markets by telling
them that they are stupid, and a government which professes to believe in
market discipline should not put up with such arrogance for a moment.
The first step, then, would be to admit that the government has been guided
by dreadful advice; and the second, to seek better. The Treasury should be
calling in some of those who were right when it was wrong: its bete noire,
Sir Alan Walters; some of the City monetarists who saw most of what was
coming; and perhaps the economic modellers of Liverpool and Cambridge, whose
official research funds were cut off because, it seems, their methods were
too unlike those which have failed at the Treasury.
It is a bit late, though, to hope to inspire confidence simply by showing
that ministers are now willing to listen to both sides of an argument. The
markets need to know that the old errors have been discarded; and the most
convincing way to doing that is not only to bring in new advisers, but get
rid of the old ones. This might even, in present circumstances, mean getting
rid of the minority who were right, in the Bank as well as the Treasury, as
well as the rest. This would not be fair, but fairness may be more than we
can afford at the moment. All that matters is to be convincing.

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Bonds: Borrowers putting their faith in the US
dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US dollar surged back to centre stage in the international bond market
in the third quarter of this year as Europe's currency markets wavered, then
cracked under the pressure of the ERM.
Figures for the three months to the end of September show the huge reliance
now being placed by borrowers on the US currency. Some Dollars 31.3bn of
Eurodollar bonds were issued, 56 per cent of the total amount raised on the
international markets. After the steady decline of the Eurodollar bond - it
accounted for more than half of all borrowing in 1989, but had shrunk to
only 31 per cent by last year - the renaissance has been startling.
Against the background of low US interest rates, the use of the currency has
been all the more notable. Hence the renewed interest in 'collared'
floating-rate notes, typically offering a minimum coupon of 5 per cent, of
which more than Dollars 6bn have been issued in recent weeks. However,
interest in these bonds in the secondary market will evaporate quickly
should US rates climb back above 5 per cent.
All the signs now point to further use of the dollar, along with the other
traditional currencies for international borrowing - the D-Mark and the yen.
The Ecu, a putative international reserve currency earlier this year, has
been stopped dead in its tracks. Nearly 15 per cent of all international
bond issuance last year was undertaken in the Ecu. Over the last three
months, due to the the Danish vote on the Maastricht treaty in June, that
proportion has fallen to less than 1 per cent.
Other 'fringe' European currencies, which had become popular as investors
looked for ways to trade on the convergence of European bond yields, have
also lost their appeal. And the Canadian dollar - another popular currency,
accounting for nearly 10 per cent of bonds issued last year - is unlikely to
be taken up again until there is a clear end to Canada's constitutional
uncertainties.
Ironically, it is the European countries which have suffered most in the
upheaval of the ERM that are likely to be the biggest borrowers in the
dollar, D-Mark and yen in the months ahead, for three reasons.
First, they have yawning fiscal deficits to finance. Continuing recession in
several European countries has depressed tax revenues and pushed up social
security payments. Investors are only half persuaded by the recent efforts
of countries like Spain and Italy to hold down their deficits, a fact which
has helped to fracture ERM.
Second, the interest of international investors in the domestic bond markets
of these countries has shrunk. That leaves countries with the prospect of
borrowing more from domestic savers, thereby pushing up long-term interest
rates, or borrowing in foreign currencies. Doing the latter could also help
to persuade international investors of their will not to devalue, something
from which Italy benefited as it announced new foreign currency borrowing
plans last Thursday.
Third, a range of countries, from Scandinavia to Italy, Spain, the UK and
Ireland, have either seen their foreign currency reserves fall sharply as a
result of intervention in the exchange markets, or face the prospect of
repaying the Bundesbank in D-Marks for its own support of their currencies.
Either way, the need to borrow in D-Marks has risen sharply.
The trouble is, the credit standing of several of these countries has been
declining sharply. Last week, Moody's Investors Service, the US rating
agency, said it was considering downgrading both Spain and Sweden. Sweden, a
top-rated name until the beginning of 1991, is currently classed AA1, while
Spain is AA2. They could be set to follow Italy, which fell to AA3 this
summer, perilously close to the single-A status which would push it outside
the ranks of general acceptability in the investment world.
Demand for European currencies, including the D-Mark, accounts for Deutsche
Bank's position as the most active bookrunner in the Euromarket in the first
nine months of this year. It took the lead in 8.2 per cent of the Dollars
204bn raised.
Mr Roger Bates, of Deutsche Bank in London, says that demand for Eurobonds
could be weak in the near future as investors concentrate on reducing their
currency risks. That could raise the cost of borrowing in the international
bond market still further, after a rise in yields which has already been
noticeable in the past fortnight.
However, Mr Bates adds: 'When things stabilise, they (investors) will start
to think of performance again' - leading to renewed interest in Eurobonds.

FT  05 OCT 92 / European Government Bonds: Spain suffers from volatile
trading conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish bond market is reeling. In little more than two weeks the peseta
has been devalued, effective exchange controls have been reintroduced and
the Kingdom of Spain's foreign currency debt has been put under review for a
possible downgrade.
Last month's five per cent devaluation brought the peseta's parity in the
ERM down from Pta65 to the D-Mark to Pta68.4, but the currency has stayed
weak despite continued intervention by the Bank of Spain.
The devaluation took place on September 18: five days later the Bank of
Spain forced institutions purchasing foreign currency against the peseta, or
buying pesetas, to make a 12-month interest-free deposit equivalent to the
transaction with the Bank. The Bank said the measures were necessary because
of the 'volatility, speculation and disorder' in the currency markets.
'A lot of confidence has been killed and there is a clear sentiment, lead by
foreigners, to get out of Spain,' said Mr Alvaro Villacieros, chief of
trading at James Capel's Madrid securities house.
The 10-year bond yield rose by nearly a full point to 13.50. That same week,
trading began on a Dollars 1.5bn issue that represented the Kingdom of
Spain's first venture into the Eurodollar bond market. The Kingdom was
forced to increase the yield by 10 basis points to 55 over US Treasury
bonds.
The effective reintroduction of exchange controls was an ill-fated decision
that was taken as the lesser of three evils. The Bank of Spain took it in
preference to taking the peseta out of the ERM and raising interest rates.
At the weekend, Mr Carlos Solchaga, the economy minister, singled out the
measures as a 'real problem' and said he hoped they would be lifted 'in the
next few days' in order to restore investor confidence. He conceded that it
would then 'take time for confidence to return'.
What the markets sense is that, in all logic, any decision to lift exchange
controls can only be accompanied by a decision to realign the peseta. Mr
Solchaga hinted as much when he called for a 'disposition (among EMS
members) to consider frankly whether the (ERM) grid is the right one'.
The other greater evil that the exchange control measures sought to avoid -
a rise in interest rates - is also back on the cards. Independently of
whether the controls are lifted or not following a realignment, the market
expects interest rates to climb.
Interbank rates rose last week by 0.25 per cent to 15.5 per cent and an
important auction of certificates of deposit, CBE's, today is expected to
deliver higher rates.
In this environment the decision last week by Moody's Investor Services to
put Spain's AA2 credit rating under a review was characterised as 'not very
opportune' by Mr Solchaga and bluntly called 'the final straw' by a broker
in Madrid.
Investors were by this stage near panic and the Madrid stock market's
general index tumbled to its lowest level for six years.
If the ERM, and the peseta within it, is saved through a realignment, or if
some form of mechanism, such as the 'multilateral fund' that Mr Solchaga is
currently canvassing, is introduced to restore depleted national reserves
(Spain's remain robust at Dollars 59.6bn after spending a reported Dollars
13.5bn last month to defend the peseta) and if there can be an ordered
pan-European retreat from high interest rates lead by Germany, then what
will the bond market be looking at in Spain?
The quick answer is the government's ability to implement a 1993 budget that
it describes as the toughest in 20 years. The budget increases central
government spending by only 3.7 per cent, a fall in real terms, and is
likely to push up unemployment next year by 300,000 to beyond the three
million level.
The market will increasingly scrutinise Spain. The Spanish treasury needs to
raise a total of Dollars 55bn before the end of the year, some Dollars 17bn
of it in net new financing, in order to service the deficit.

FT  05 OCT 92 / US Money and Credit: Poor economic data leave markets in a
quandary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK of consistently poor economic data but no reduction in interest rates
left the US bond markets waiting and hoping. The statistical build-up was
impressive. On Tuesday, there was the Commerce Department report, which
showed that the index of leading economic indicators - supposed to gauge
future industrial and commercial activity - fell 0.2 per cent in August.
The same day, the Conference Board unveiled its consumer confidence index
for September. This, too, showed a slump, with the number falling to 56.4,
from a revised 59.0 in in the previous month.
A couple of days later, the National Association of Purchasing Mangers index
for September rolled out at 49.0, having stood at 53.7 for August. When the
index slips below 50.0, this suggests that activity in the manufacturing
sector is declining - a scenario which was last posted in January.
To compound the gloom. spending on new construction during August was shown
to have fallen by 0.8 per cent, after a 0.2 per cent rise in July. Finally,
Friday brought the September unemployment figures - the bond market's
primary focus all week.
The data could have been worse. Non-farm jobs fell by 57,000 during the
month, substantially less than the 120,000 decline forecast by many
economists, while the unemployment rate improved marginally - from 7.6 to
7.5 per cent.
However, after closer inspection, the numbers seemed less encouraging. While
the effects of Hurricane Andrew and summer jobs programmes undoubtably
muddied the figures, analysts were quick to note an apparent continued
decline in jobs in both the manufacturing and construction sectors. The
consensus was simple: the employment market remains extremely weak.
Still, the Federal Reserve took no further action on interest rates. On the
contrary, the Fed conspicuously failed to inject reserves into the banking
system during the traditional pre-noon intervention period on Friday - a
move which was generally read as signalling caution.
So the US bond markets, which had rallied early in the week and then eased
when the dollar came under pressure, were left in something of a quandary.
The knee-jerk reaction was for bond prices to fall immediately after the
unemployment numbers were announced. However, by Friday afternoon, when the
numbers had been examined more closely, prices rose again. The benchmark
30-year long bond ended the week at 99, down just  3/32 , where it yields
7.33 per cent. This was marginally below the previous week's closing yield
of 7.35 per cent.
All eyes are now on the monthly policy-setting meeting of Federal Reserve's
Open Market Committee. This is due to take place on Tuesday, and many
pundits believe that the recent stream of economic data - including the
unemployment numbers - more than justifies some further reduction in
interest rates.
'We would anticipate that easing to incorporate a reduction of the funds
rate target to 2.75 per cent and the discount rate to 2.5 per cent',
commented analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette - a sentiment echoed by a
number of other commentators.
One obvious consideration for the Fed is the potential impact on the dollar
 -although most economists now suggest that disinflationary forces present
in the US economy are capable of offsetting any inflation generated by a
declining currency.
However, a timely reminder of the continued hawkish sentiment which
dominates some quarters came when Federal Reserve Board Governor Mr Wayne
Angell indicated that another downturn in economic activity was 'not likely
at all' and predicted that nominal growth in GDP should range between 4 and
5 per cent during the next nine months.

FT  05 OCT 92 / UK Gilts: Investors seek signs of new policy direction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GILT investors are feeling the full effects of the general malaise over the
direction of UK economic policy. Last week long-dated gilts dropped 1 1/2
points as worries piled up about how Britain intends to cope with the loss
of its central economic plank in the shape of membership of the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Much of the malaise in the market was connected with the pound's 11 1/2
pfennig loss against the D-Mark during the week. On Friday night in London
it was quoted at DM2.43, more than 50 pfennigs below its former central rate
of DM2.95 in the ERM from which it was suspended nearly three weeks ago.
In the immediate aftermath of the suspension, the gilt market strengthened,
especially at the short end of the market on thoughts that the floating
pound would permit a rapid lowering in base rates, now 9 per cent. Such a
move might help the limping economy move out of recession, and generally
restore confidence in UK economic policies.
However, since Black Wednesday on September 16 the government's economic
policy-making machine has been in a state of torpor. Senior ministers have
had to worry about how to re-orient policy towards Europe, and have also
become embroiled in a dramatic argument with the Bundesbank over who was to
blame for sterling's ERM exit.
Mr Nigel Richardson, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, said many in
financial markets were worried by lack of direction in UK government
policies over the economy. 'We are seeing a policy vacuum. No one has any
clear idea about the Treasury's policies over interest rates and the pound.'
Last week, while short-dated gilts remained steady, and even gained in price
by a small amount at the very short end of the market, long maturing bonds
saw their yields rise. As well as the worries over policy, there is also a
nagging suspicion among some gilt market experts that inflationary
pressures, which for some two years have been kept in check by the the ERM
discipline, may in the months ahead become re-ignited if interest rates come
down too quickly.
The concerns pushed down the price of the long maturing 9 per cent Treasury
bond due in 2008 to 96 9/16 on Friday night, some 1 1/2 points less than a
week previously. Its yield climbed consequently to 9.42 per cent from 9.21
per cent.
Mr Philp Tyson, a bond analyst at UBS Phillips and Drew, is looking for
further rises in yields especially at the long end of the gilt curve in the
next few months. The price falls for such classes of gilts could be expected
to spill over to the 10-year benchmark stock, which generally had a good
month in September as yields fell. The yield on a 10-year UK government
stock declined by 25 basis points (0.25 percentage points) during the month,
while on a comparable basis yields on French, Japanese and US government
securities fell by rather less - 21 basis points, 11 basis points and 9
basis points respectively.
During the month German government bonds performed best of all, yielding 50
basis points less at the end of September compared to the start. Much of
this good performance in German bonds is related to the rise in the value of
the D-Mark against most other European currencies, a development which is
likely to continue in the next week or so after the decision by the
Bundesbank council on Friday to leave credit rates unchanged, against
expectations of an easing in monetary policy.

The week's international merger and acquisition activity saw the renewal of
one major trend and the possible continuation of another, writes Brian
Bollen.
The biggest deal of the week saw hostilities renewed in the international
chocolate war. The offer by Kraft General Foods International, part of the
Philip Morris Group of the US, for Freia Maribou of Norway, continues the
consolidation and concentration of the industry over the past five years.
If it succeeds, the combination of Freia, Kraft and Jacobs Suchard, through
which the offer is being made, will create Scandinavia's leading branded
confectionery group. The deal needs government approval and could be blocked
by the Hershey group which has an 18.6 per cent stake.
Elsewhere, the week had a distinctly oriental flavour. The biggest new UK
development was the swoop by Hongkong Land for up to 29.99 per cent of debt
laden but asset rich property developer Trafalgar House.
The move could be described as another example of a Keswick-controlled
British Hong Kong company preparing for 1997 by going home, an attempt to
asset strip or a way to unlock shareholder value, depending on one's point
of view.
Dutch electronics group Philips is preparing to manufacture lighting
products in Japan for the first time, by taking a 70 per cent stake in Kondo
Sylvania from GTE Sylvania of the US.
The week's developments in the international airline industry saw renewed
efforts in the US to stop British Airways taking its planned stake in USAir,
and Ireland's Guinness Peat Aviation create a joint venture with Air
Ukraine.

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: CST Emerging Asia to dismiss
fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of CST Emerging Asia Trust said it intends to dismiss Jupiter
Tyndall, its fund managers, writes John Authers.
Jupiter Tyndall has a 29.9 per cent stake in CST, and yesterday proposed the
appointment of three new directors to the board. Mr Michael Seal, chairman
of CST, said yesterday that this would create 'an unacceptable risk of
conflict of interest'.
He said: 'Jupiter Tyndall's resolutions amount to an attempt to gain control
of the company's board without making an offer of shares.'
The CST board said that Jupiter Tyndall's performance as an investment
manager in recent months had been poor, and that the company had been
'consistently inflexible' in its approach to negotiation.
Mr Seal said that the board had therefore given Jupiter Tyndall 12 months'
notice of termination of its contracts as investment manager and
administrator. The board is also proposing a special resolution to wind up
the company at next year's annual general meeting - three years before it
had been planned to do so.
The board made it clear that it was reluctant to shorten the life of the
trust by three years, but believed the measure would reduce the current
discount of the share price to net asset value per share.

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Losses mount at Reed Executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PERFORMANCE of Reed Executive, the loss-making employment agency,
worsened in the first half of 1992 with losses reaching Pounds 3.7m, a 14
per cent increase on the same period last time.
The family-controlled Reed board, chaired by Mr Alec Reed, said the poor
results meant the company was unable to pay an interim dividend. Mr Reed
said there were signs of a tentative recovery although turnover fell 7 per
cent to Pounds 40.8m in the 26 weeks to June 28.
He added that there had been an upturn in demand for temporary office
workers and that margins were slowly moving back towards previous levels -
Reed last made a profit in the first half of 1990-91.
Mr Reed said: 'We are still trading at a loss and expect to do so for some
time yet.'
Concern at the mounting losses prompted the chairman and executives to take
pay cuts of up to 42 per cent earlier this year.

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Nathu Puri buys Conder
Structures from receivers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NATHU Ram Puri, chairman of the private mini-conglomerate, Melton Medes,
has purchased Conder Structures, the structural steel business of Conder
Group, from receivers.
Mr Puri refused to reveal the cash price, although he said it was a
'significant seven-figure sum'.
Conder Group was placed into administrative receivership last month
following the announcement of Pounds 22.6m in pre-tax losses for 1992. The
company is believed to have suffered Pounds 31m in losses on two contracts
last year, from which it never recovered.
Conder Structures, which employed 337 people before the receivership, had
sales of Pounds 40m in 1991. Mr Puri said he expected to retain between 50
and 150 jobs.
Mr Puri, who is contesting a high court action by members of two pension
funds controlled by Melton Medes, said he was considering the option of not
having a pension scheme for employees of Conder Structures.
The case against Melton Medes Pension Trustees and MM Fund Management, the
funds' trustees, is expected to come to court next month. It was launched by
the Graphical Paper and Media Union in an attempt to obtain information
about the investment of scheme assets and in an effort to appoint a judicial
or independent trustee.

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Finance package for Westminster
Scaffolding
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Westminster Scaffolding has completed negotiations to withdraw totally from
its property development interests.
It also unveiled proposals for a debt restructuring and an underwritten
offer to raise Pounds 2.6m net to finance future growth.
The directors said the proposals would put the group on a 'sound financial
footing' and enable it to concentrate on its principal business of
scaffolding.
The Midland Bank is to subscribe in cash at par for 12.5m new ordinary
shares, representing 24.83 per cent of the enlarged share capital.
The proceeds will be used to reduce the company's debt to the Midland which
at September 17 stood at some Pounds 3.54m.
Following implementation of the proposals debt to the Midland will remain at
Pounds 1.14m. The bank has agreed to provide a continuing overdraft facility
up to a maximum Pounds 1.15m for an initial 12 months.
The cash call is of 2.6m units at 120p per unit cash. Each unit comprises

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Cross-border M&amp;A deals in
publishing decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Cross-border merger and acquisition activity in the publishing industry, has
seen a dramatic decline, according to a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick, the
international accountancy and management consultancy firm.
In 1989 there were 106 acquisitions worth Dollars 5.35bn (Pounds 3bn) in
newspapers, books, periodicals and printing.
In the six months to June 1992 there were only 23 acquisitions worth Dollars
56m.
Mr Richard Paterson of KPMG said the common view in the 1980's that
international multi-media groups were the way forward had fuelled an
acquisition boom.
'The companies which won the takeover battles were often the ones that lost
out in the long run: now they are burdened with debts and seeing the value
of their acquisitions plummet,' Mr Patterson said.
The recent announcement that Reed International and Elsevier, the Dutch
international publishers intended to merge was strong confirmation that a
longer running trend towards greater international integration in the
publishing industry was continuing.
In the four and a half years to June 1992 the UK was the top purchaser in
the industry by a wide margin with 145 deals worth a total of Dollars
6.958bn.
More than half of that was, however, accounted for by 22 deals done by the
late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The UK was also the second largest seller of publishing companies with 39
deals worth a total of Dollars 1.76bn. But Britain was a long way behind the
US which had 156 deals worth Dollars 13.6bn.

Pressure on margins pushed pre-tax profit of Ash &amp; Lacy, the West
Midlands-based galvanising and metal pressings group, down 14 per cent in
the six months ended July from Pounds 2.31m to Pounds 1.97m on increased
turnover of Pounds 28.72m (Pounds 27.83m).
Mr David Fletcher, chairman, said that despite the continuing effect of the
recession, cash flow remained good and the balance sheet healthy. With
strong presence in each of its major markets, the company remains well
positioned.
Earnings fell to 5.09p (6.04p). The interim dividend was maintained at 2.5p.

LINX Printing Technologies, the Cambridge-based maker of ink-jet printers,
is to make its stock market debut on October 15.
Linx will be introduced through a placing by Morgan Grenfell and is expected
to have a market value of about Pounds 20m. It is unlikely that the
prospective price/earnings ratio will be any lower than that of its larger
rival, Domino, at about 16 times.
After the placing the nine-member board will hold more than 50 per cent of
the shares.
The company will publish a pathfinder prospectus tomorrow showing an 87 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.64m for the year to June 30. Sales
were 62 per cent higher at Pounds 10.5m. Earnings per share of about 9.07p
compare with 5.14p last time.
A strong position in the more recession-resistant foods and pharmaceuticals
sectors helped UK profits increase by 80 per cent last year, according to
managing director Mr Michael Keeling.
Mr Keeling, one of the company's founders, said Linx intended to use the
placing proceeds for acquisitions.
Linx plans to expand its presence in the production line application of ink
jet process. For example, in identifying stocks held in warehouses or
incoming supplies.
The company believed worldwide sales of continuous ink jet printers would
grow by 10 per cent per annum over the next few years.

FT  05 OCT 92 / International Company News: Brierley extends Gibbs Mew offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments Limited, the New Zealand investment company which has
made a hostile Pounds 11m bid for Gibbs Mew, has extended its offer for the
Salisbury-based brewer until October 9.
That is the date of an extraordinary meeting for Gibbs shareholders to vote
on the proposed purchase of drinks distributor UK D.
Brierley said that if the Pounds 2.3m purchase was approved, it would drop
its 200p bid for Gibbs.
In a document posted to Gibbs shareholders last week, BIL said the
acquisition of UK D would be 'a serious mistake which could seriously damage
Gibbs Mew'.
It urged shareholders 'whether or not they wish to accept the BIL offer' to
vote against the acquisition.
Brierley launched its bid for Gibbs, which is almost 60 per cent controlled
by the Gibbs family, in August. The New Zealand company holds 19.7 per cent
of Gibbs Mew.
Before the bid was launched, rumours had circulated the market that Gibbs
was planning an acquisition on the drinks side of its business. It has been
suggested that a growing dispute between the Gibbs family and BIL over the
acquisition led to the New Zealand company's offer.
However, the board and family members representing 55.5 per cent of Gibbs'
shares have rejected the offer.

<TEXT>
SUN HUNG Kai Properties, one of Hong Kong's leading property developers
which is controlled by the Kwok family, yesterday posted a 40 per cent
increase in profits to HKDollars 4.68bn (Pounds 354.5m) in the year ended
June, 1992.
Profit was struck on a 22 per cent increase in turnover to HKDollars 10.66bn
from HKDollars 8.77bn in 1990-91.
A final dividend of 75 cents is to be paid, making HKDollars 1.14 for the
year - up 18.75 per cent on the previous year's total payout. There was also
a cash bonus of 15 cents a share, the same as last time.
Mr Walter Kwok, the company's chairman, said he envisaged satisfactory
growth in the coming year and that dividends would increase accordingly.
Sun Hung Kai has one of the biggest land banks in Hong Kong. During the year
it acquired 27 sites for development with an aggregate gross floor area of
4.45m sq ft. Its total land bank exceeds 37m sq ft.
This year marked a change in strategy. In July it raised HKDollars 3.3bn
through a placement of shares to fund property investment in China.
The company said it intended that 10 per cent of its future business should
be generated from works in China. It is pursuing investment opportunities in
Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen and Hainan Island.
'The group will adopt a selective approach and will concentrate on high
quality real estate and related projects,' it said.
The company added that the remaining 90 per cent of its business would be in
Hong Kong, split 80/10 between property and non-property interests.
It said an independent assessors valued its stock of 12.6m sq ft of
completed investment properties in Hong Kong at HKDollars 34.3bn, compared
with a valuation of HKDollars 18.5bn placed on 10.5m sq ft of completed
property a year earlier.

ADT, the security group which has written off Pounds 65m on its 27 per cent
stake in Lep Group, is suing Lep and four of its present and former
directors, writes Jane Fuller.
The court action is being pursued in the US by an ADT subsidiary called
Itoba. It has complained that ADT relied on misleading public statements
when it bought shares in Lep in 1990.
Last year Lep, the freight forwarding and security concern, incurred a loss
of Pounds 235.1m after Pounds 219.4m of exceptional and extraordinary
charges. The biggest write-off was the entire US property portfolio,
previously valued at Pounds 93.4m.
The group slid to more than Pounds 500m of net debt and Pounds 109m of
negative shareholders' funds.
With company doctor Mr David James installed as chairman, a rescue package
has been negotiated entailing about 25 banks swapping Pounds 180m of debt
for 85 per cent of the restructured company.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Companies stuck on the rocky road to recovery: Andrew Bolger
hears the very grim message coming from British boardrooms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING's devaluation and the consequent stock market rally have tended to
obscure the grim message emerging from Britain's boardrooms: UK companies
have just endured a very bleak summer.
Managers, who had seen their hopes for a rapid post-election recovery fizzle
out by June, said trading continued to be tough in the third quarter of the
year. Although devaluation and lower interest rates do hold out the prospect
of some longer-term relief, the impact is unlikely to feed through for some
time.
Imperial Chemical Industries told Hoare Govett, one of its brokers, that
demand was slow in July and very weak in August. Anecdotal evidence from
September suggested little improvement.
Hoare Govett duly downgraded its forecast of the chemicals and
pharmaceutical group's third-quarter pre-tax profits to Pounds 100m,
compared with Pounds 196m for the same period last year. Mr Martin Evans,
chemicals analyst at the broker, said there was limited room for improvement
next year. He downgraded ICI's full-year profits for 1992 from Pounds 780m
to Pounds 620m because of poor demand.
Stockbrokers last week cut forecasts of next year's profits from Hanson, the
UK conglomerate, after meeting the company.
Just before sterling's devaluation, Courtaulds Textiles, the UK's second
biggest textiles and clothing manufacturer, issued a stark warning on
prospects for recovery, saying that 'there are no signs of improvement in
trading conditions'.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said his main
concern had been the pressures his company would have faced next year, had
the pound continued to trade near the Dollars 2 level. He said: 'There
really was the most enormous squeeze looming over the hill. Obviously we are
very relieved that prospect has been removed.'
Retailers have also had a difficult time, with the short-lived boost in
sales immediately after the election rapidly being overtaken by a plunge in
consumer confidence as the unemployment outlook continued to darken over the
summer months.
Britain's unemployment total rose in August to a five-year high of 2.8m. The
increase in the month - at more than 47,000 - was much higher than expected.
The seasonally adjusted increase was the 28th consecutive monthly rise and
the largest in one month since January. Manufacturing output was flat in
July month-on-month and showed no growth in the three months to the end of
July.
Kingfisher, one of the UK's biggest retailing groups, said: 'A good month
has been followed by a bad one. Some of our markets have looked stronger
only to fade away again. It is a tough world out there for retailers and it
is not going to get any easier.'
Mr Geoff Mulcahy, Kingfisher's chairman and chief executive, added: 'If your
house price has fallen, you are afraid of losing your job, and you have high
levels of personal debt you are bloody well not going to go out and spend
money no matter where interest rates are.'
Sales of new cars in August rose by only 1.7 per cent compared with the same
month last year, dashing hopes that this year would mark the end to the
three-year decline in demand for new vehicles.
Ford UK and Rolls-Royce Motors Cars have announced a total of 2,500
redundancies, following other big reductions announced by Jaguar, Aston
Martin and Group Lotus.
The chain reaction caused by reductions in orders from big companies was
blamed for the 53 per cent increase in business failures in the third
quarter of the year. Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information company,
said the 46,545 failures in the first nine months of this year had already
surpassed the figure for the whole of last year.
The 457-point fall in the FT-SE 100 between May and its pre-devaluation
trough in August was largely fuelled by a string of negative messages from
companies to analysts. The proportion of resulting changes in analysts'
forecasts which were downgrades rose to 80 per cent in the late summer,
according to BZW.
In spite of all these downgrades, most analysts continued to take an
over-optimistic view of companies' likely performance. Even if companies
will not see much benefit from a lower pound and interest rates before next
year, devaluation has certainly come to the rescue of analysts, who would
have otherwise had to continue downgrading.
Mr Mark Brown, market strategist for UBS Philips &amp; Drew, said his house had
persistently highlighted the inevitability of sterling devaluation, but had
still been caught out by the speed and manner in which it came about.
He said: 'The effect of early devaluation has broadly been to offset
downgrades that were already in train.'
Devaluation caused Mr Brown to increase his forecast of industrial profits
from 10 to 14 per cent next year, following a 4 per cent average rise this
year. He has left his dividend growth number unchanged at 2 per cent for
this year and 6 per cent next year.
UBS Philips &amp; Drew stands by its market targets of 2,700 on the FT-SE at the
end of this year and 3,000 by the middle of next year. But Mr Brown admits:
'Our existing market targets were looking increasingly bold before
devaluation occurred and have really only been salvaged by recent events. We
would not choose to pour cold water on the market at this level, but the
road to economic recovery is still an extraordinarily rocky one.'

FT  05 OCT 92 / Economics Notebook: Economic policy vacuum in a floating
world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Nearly three weeks on from Black Wednesday, the UK is still without any
semblance of an economic policy.
Indeed ever since sterling was forced to quit the European exchange rate
mechanism, official comments have generated heat rather than shed light. The
past weeks' war of words between the UK Treasury and the Bundesbank has left
Britain almost as much in the dark about the future underpinnings of policy
as when the 23 month-long experiment of pegging sterling to the D-Mark
failed.
We do, it is true, know something about the government's intentions. A few
days after sterling's float, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, told fellow
finance ministers in Washington that policy setting would give weight to a
range of financial indicators. These would include narrow money, with the
current 0 to 4 per cent growth target remaining in place, as well as broad
money, asset prices (with particular reference to house prices) and the
exchange rate.
The prime goal will be still to bear down on inflation. Some senior Treasury
officials appear to think that an 'inflation target' might be helpful in
this regard.
But there has been no attempt so far to explain how these policies would
work. Mr Lamont's address to the Conservative Party Conference this week
will be honed to help his political survival. He may give some policy
details to the Commons' Treasury and Civil Service committee next Monday.
But the Treasury's assumption after the float was that the chancellor's
October 29 Mansion House speech would be the occasion to expound on monetary
policy. Fiscal policy, or at least the public spending part of it, should be
made clearer with publication of the Autumn Statement, probably in
mid-November.
Sterling's sharp fall last week underlined the dangers in this leisurely
approach to policy making. When trading ended on Friday, the pound's value
against the D-Mark was about 12.5 per cent below its old DM2.778 ERM floor.
By any standard, this devaluation is substantial. It has already seriously
weakened the logic of the UK moving to a floating regime instead of simply
devaluing and returning to ERM disciplines. The attraction of floating was
that it would give the authorities an opportunity to cut interest rates and
so ease a monetary policy policy that had come to be judged too tight at a
time of prolonged recession.
Mr Lamont made full use of that freedom on September 22 when he cut British
bank base rates by a full percentage point to 9 per cent from 10 per cent.
On that day, the pound actually gained slightly to close at DM2.545 in
London. After a week of trading insults between London and Frankfurt, it
closed on Friday at DM2.43, for a loss of 11.5 pfennigs. As a result, the
next move in interest rates could be up rather than down.
At one time, the Treasury had a rule of thumb that equated a 10 per cent
devaluation to a 2.5 percentage point base rate cut. This is now formally
disowned in Great George Street. But the easing of monetary conditions
implicit in the latest devaluation is substantial as is the inflationary
potential of the weaker pound.
In a gloomy assessment of the inflationary potential of sterling's fall, the
National Institute of Economic and Social Research has calculated that a 10
per cent sterling devaluation will add 3.8 percentage points to retail price
inflation in 1993, 3.7 points in 1994, 2 points in 1995 and 1.1 points in
1996.
With next Friday's announcement of the retail prices index expected to show
that UK inflation in September was running at an annual 3.5 per cent, the
NIESR's calculations would suggest that Britain is again on the threshold of
rising prices.
But if the past two years have taught anything, it is to beware of
econometric models. There is a strong belief among economists that
inflationary pressures are especially subdued.
Mr Michael Saunders, UK economist of Salomon Brothers in London, argues that
the government has chosen a good time to devalue. The recession should
prevent higher import costs being passed on in full to the consumer and
there is no strong inflationary pressure from commodity prices.
Mr Douglas McWilliams, the CBI's chief economic adviser believes a 10 per
cent sterling devaluation might add 1 to 1.25 percentage points a year to
retail price inflation. In that case, RPI inflation could stabilise in the 3
to 4 per cent range for 2 years or so rather than rise.
Some optimists see similarities with the early 1980s when sterling fell
sharply, interest rates declined and inflation moved downwards - albeit
unevenly - until the middle of the decade. This parallel cannot be taken too
far, however. Sterling was less obviously overvalued before Black Wednesday
than in the early 1980s.
So if the chancellor would be unwise to let policy drift for too long, what,
credibly, can he do?
The government, having sunk all its eggs in the ERM basket, and having
failed to live up to its promise to defend successfully the pound's parity,
is left asking the nation to take its ability to manage the economy on
trust. Britain's recent history is reason enough not to do so.
It is likely that the government will seek to target at least some of the
financial indicators identified by Mr Lamont. But some senior policy makers
have already concluded that to make that move credible, there will have to
be a more open discussion of policy options so that they can be debated and
tested by government insiders and outsiders.
Such a development, for example, would mean that the UK could never again go
into the ERM at a central rate of DM2.95 without any rational discussion of
the merits or demerits of the rate.
In a nation as obsessively secretive as Britain any move that made economic
policy making more open and accountable would be a significant advance. It
would be the one good thing to emerge from what otherwise has been a
catastrophic failure of government.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Survey reveals variety in accounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES disclose more financial information and data on social
issues than their overseas competitors, according to a survey of the annual
reports of leading quoted companies from nine countries.
Swedish companies provide most detail in their operational review and
Italian ones least, the study from Shelley Taylor &amp; Associates, a
London-based corporate strategy consultant, shows. UK and French companies
revealed most in their accounts about factors such as shareholders, cash
flows and segmental information by sector and country - which readers
consider important. The Italians revealed least.
The analysis considered disclosure of non-statutory information in the most
recent of 160 company accounts chosen from the 1,000 companies with the
largest market capitalisation in France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain,
Switzerland, Sweden, the UK and the USA.
The UK rated highest on disclosure of corporate social information such as
equal opportunities, training, health and safety and the environment.
Scoring required a discussion of the issue to be clearly visible and consume
at least 50 words of text in the annual report.
However, more than four times as many US as UK companies offered any numbers
to back up the words or linked their social activities to business
performance in some way. French companies also scored twice as highly as the
British on this measure.
Swedish companies disclosed most about in their management review about
strategy, the risks of business, research and development and political and
economic trends. The UK came sixth.
About two-fifths of companies in the nine countries had a 'mission
statement' expressing their objectives, and 78 per cent had a statement of
strategy.
Although 91 per cent of companies provided information on prospects, only 63
per cent set any quantified objectives.
Only US companies included statements showing management's responsibility
for internal accounting control and for the financial statements.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Trafalgar to change accounting policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE, the property, construction and engineering group under
siege from Hongkong Land, is expected to change its accounting policies
following an investigation by the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the new
accounting standards watchdog.
The outcome of the panel's investigation, which started in February, is also
likely to have a significant effect on Trafalgar's results for the financial
year to September 30, 1992.
The move centres on Pounds 102.7m worth of development properties Trafalgar
reclassified in 1991 as fixed assets, resulting in a Pounds 68m writedown of
wholly-owned properties and a Pounds 34.7m writedown of associates. If the
writedowns had been deducted from the profit and loss account, as the panel
is understood to have argued, they would have reduced last year's Pounds
122.4m pre-tax profits.
Sir Eric Parker, Trafalgar's chief executive, said: 'The group's accounts
were the responsibility of the board which have acted with the very best
advice from our financial advisers. The accounts were unqualified by our
auditor, Touche Ross.'
He added: 'There are different views within the accounting profession as to
how deal with things.'
Trafalgar said the panel was already looking at the accounts of another 200
companies and dismissed the incident as having little effect in its fight to
prevent Hongkong Land, which has already acquired 14.99 per cent of the
group, from taking another 15 per cent by tender this week.
However the panel, which is expected to make an announcement today, says it
is investigating the accounts of fewer than 20 companies.
Trafalgar is understood to have accepted the ruling of the panel - to
transfer the development properties back into current assets - to avoid
going to the High Court, which could have compelled the group to revise its
accounts.
Trafalgar will give details of the expected amendments to its accounting
practices and policies in a circular to be sent to institutional
shareholders tomorrow.
Sir Eric, who was yesterday working on the final details of the circular
with senior directors at Trafalgar's London headquarters, said he would try
to reassure shareholders that the panel's ruling would not have any effect
on the value of Trafalgar's businesses.
Shareholders' funds at the year-end are expected to remain unchanged at
Pounds 704.6m.
However this year's pre-tax profits are expected to be further dented by new
writedowns.
The board still intends to pay a final dividend although it is expected to
be severely cut from last year's 9.6p.
Trafalgar said Kleinwort Benson, one of its financial advisers, is marketing
its hotels, which include the Ritz and the Stafford and are valued at Pounds
130m by Trafalgar, to around 30 potential buyers.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Bankers cautious on Italian debt buy-back

BANKERS have reacted with cautious interest to the Italian government's plan
to use the proceeds from privatisation to buy back state debt.
The aim would be to reduce what some prominent treasury economists call the
'black hole' of government debt. The cost of servicing debt accounts for
most of the state's financing needs.
A new fund would receive proceeds from all planned privatisation issues,
excluding those where the receipts are destined to reduce the debts of
heavily-borrowed state holding companies selling their subsidiaries.
Proceeds from the disposals of Credito Italiano, the bank controlled by the
Iri state holding company, and Nuovo Pignone, the engineering group owned by
the public-sector Eni energy and chemicals concern, would not be put into
the new fund. Receipts would be used to shore up the balance sheets of Iri
and Eni.
The fund will also receive cash from future dividend payments by Iri, Eni,
Enel and Ina, the four public sector concerns recently transformed into
joint stock companies.
Bankers are now keen to know what bonds would be withdrawn via the new fund,
and whether paper would be bought at market or nominal prices. Italy issues
a wide range of debt, varying from fixed-rate three-month treasury bills to
10-year bonds and shorter-maturity floating-rate issues. Current market
rates are often well below nominal prices.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Ministers query cost of trade groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of streamlining the hundreds of trade associations in the UK to
bring greater efficiency into industrial lobbying is being raised by
ministers at the Department of Trade and Industry, concerned that the
plethora of organisations could be hindering business's competitiveness.
In informal meetings with industrialists and businessmen, Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, and Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry
minister, have been asking whether companies are getting value for money
from their membership of a range of associations.
The ministers are conscious that even medium-sized businesses may spend
several thousand pounds each year on membership of as many as 20 trade
associations.
Most trade associations employ a levy formula based on a percentage of the
member company's payroll or turnover, or both.
The Chemical Industries Association, for example, charges its 220 members
using a formula based on turnover and the actual number of employees. The
CIA has a turnover of Pounds 4.2m a year and the minimum charge is Pounds
3,650.
The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry has 100 members
charged Pounds 14,000 to Pounds 180,000 a year.
While the DTI emphasises that the future of trade associations must be for
industry to decide, in making it clear which organisations they take
seriously, Mr Heseltine and his colleagues have a powerful way of putting
pressure on those they see as less valuable.
The dual pressures on associations - declining income combined with
increasing costs as they have to operate in Brussels as well as at
Westminster - are seen by ministers as providing an opportunity for industry
to ensure it is getting a good deal.
One example of the sort of changes which could come about was seen at the
start of this month, when a number of organisations in the clothing and
textile industries joined forces to strengthen their lobbying power by
forming the British Apparel and Textiles Confederation.

FT  05 OCT 92 / European Parliament moves to regulate lobbyists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Parliament has taken its first step towards regulating the
growing legion of lobbyists which pursues it.
The Parliament's procedural committee adopted a report on Friday which
should provide the basis of a new system to control Brussels-based
consultants.
The result - after a parliamentary procedure which could take months or even
years - will be a register of lobbyists, formally accredited and governed by
a code of conduct. A penalty system could be introduced to deter breaches of
the code.
MEPs will not escape: under the proposals agreed last week, the current
rolling system of declaring interests would be replaced by a formal register
for MEPs and their assistants, renewed annually.
The Parliament has still not decided whether it loves or hates lobbyists.
Friday's meeting nearly descended into chaos when deputies voted first one
way and then the other on whether to expel lobbyists from the committee
room.
On the one hand, the existence of an active network of Washington-style
lobbyists lends credibility to the deliberations of the parliament and helps
inform the legislative process. On the other, consultants stand accused of
stealing documents, 'buying' client-inspired amendments, or simply harassing
MEPs.
An established Brussels consultancy described Parliament's handling of the
issue as 'shambolic', but many believe the report is a step in the right
direction, in that it should clarify their position.
But many questions remain, most notably whether a narrow definition of
lobbyists will discriminate against in-house advisers working for companies
or charities. They would not have to register, but neither would they
receive official accreditation.
With the Maastricht treaty in the balance, there is also one darker question
being muttered in lobbyist circles. By the time the code of conduct is a
reality, will the European Parliament - which of all EC institutions would
lose most if the treaty were abandoned - still be worth lobbying?

FT  05 OCT 92 / LDP warns Japanese recovery is in danger: Public spending
boost will need to be continued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE emergency public spending package announced by the Japanese government
in August will not be enough to stimulate a recovery in Japan's ailing
economy, the senior policymaker in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party
warned at the weekend.
Mr Yoshiro Mori said the Y10,700bn (Pounds 51.9bn) package would have to be
accompanied by other measures to stimulate the economy, which he said was in
such a depressed state that the government would have to use public spending
as a stimulus for several years.
Mr Mori's comments are the closest LDP leaders have come to admitting that
the package was insufficient to generate a recovery. His assessment
contradicts a consensus among officials and many Japanese economists that
the emergency spending will create a recovery by the middle of next year.
Mr Mori told a weekend seminar of LDP politicians that the government should
expand borrowing to finance higher spending as the downturn in the economy
will reduce tax revenues.
Debate about Japan's fiscal policy is increasingly likely to extend beyond
details of how to finance the emergency package and is set to encompass the
question of how higher spending should be paid for.
The Finance Ministry is against borrowing in order to finance a
supplementary budget although it is prepared for a limited increase in
borrowing through so-called construction bonds which are linked to public
investment. However, it is firmly opposed to special deficit financing bonds
as it fears this could open the way for politicians to continue to press for
higher borrowing even when the economy has recovered.
Higher borrowing during the recession of the mid-1970s led to a marked
deterioration in Japan's public finances.
Increased borrowing at the height of the recession proved difficult to
reduce once the economy had recovered because of political opposition to
cuts in public spending.
Within the broader financing debate, Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister,
is coming under pressure to consider plans for an income tax cut financed by
higher consumption taxes.
Although the ministry would favour higher indirect taxes, it recognises that
such a move would be extremely unpopular in the depths of a recession.
The ministry also opposes an income tax cut because it believes it would
lead to higher savings rather than stimulate consumption.

FT  05 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: UK retailing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
So much for a consumer-led recovery. After the devaluation, British
retailers appear a gloomy bunch. Several stores groups, including Kingfisher
and Sears, see sales bumping along the bottom, with little prospect of an
upturn. Devaluation is more of a burden than a benefit, as price increases
in imported goods will be difficult to pass on to consumers in a depressed
market. Margins, already under pressure, are likely to be squeezed further.
Even the more buoyant August sales figures were largely autumn purchases
brought forward as the soggy summer fizzled out.
To combat this, retailers are still focusing on productivity. Electronic
systems allowing tighter stock control and more flexible staff working
patterns have been introduced by companies such as WH Smith and Boots the
Chemist. Head office overheads are being reduced. But measures such as
cutting support staff only give a one-off boost to earnings growth. And many
of the gains from electronic stock control have already been exploited.
Admittedly, the gloom is not evenly spread. Lower interest rates may help
the consumer durables and DIY sectors even in the absence of housing market
recovery. These businesses are dependent on better-off homeowners whose
spending is affected by mortgage payments. They were the first stores into
recession and could be the first out. By contrast, jewellery and fashion
retailing appeal to a younger market, which only felt recession as
unemployment rose. They will take longer to recover.
In any event, an '80s-style consumer boom is simply not feasible, as any
rush of imports would have to be met quickly with higher interest rates.
That limits the capacity of stores to lead the way out of recession. The
large quoted groups such as Marks and Spencer, Kingfisher, Smiths, Boots and
GUS are solid performers. But the sector does not offer the best way to
invest for recovery.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A succession of weak economic indicators, a near-30 per cent widening in the
August current account surplus and the strength of the yen also point to a
further cut in Japan's official discount rate in the not too distant future.
The question, though, is one of timing. The worst of the recent economic
data - including the 7.6 per cent annual fall in August industrial
production announced last week - refer to a period before the Y10,700bn
(Pounds 50bn) emergency government spending package was announced on August
28. The authorities may wish to see whether this package has had any
discernible effect on confidence before they act on monetary policy.
There is admittedly no particular reason that confidence should have risen.
The measures will have only a limited impact, and the additional spending is
not as generous as it looks. Still more disconcerting is doubt whether a
half-point cut in the discount rate, now 3.25 per cent, would give the
economy a new lease of life either. Consumer confidence, already jolted by
the collapse in the property market, is being further undermined as
manufacturing incomes fall in response to cuts in overtime.
Another rate cut might thus be perceived as a sign of weakness, rather than
a signal to buy equities. The government may actually want growth. It can
also afford to spend to achieve it, but Japan seems locked in a similar
spiral to other countries coming to terms with debt deflation. The outlook
for corporate earnings is bleak and the fundamental problems of the banks
are far from resolved. It is instructive to note that the Nikkei is more
than three per cent lower than it was when the fiscal package was announced.

Friday's US employment report may have shown enough strength to convince the
Federal Reserve to delay an interest rate cut. But given the continuing
deceleration of the US economy, that delay is unlikely to last much beyond
tomorrow's meeting of the Fed's open market committee. Even if the equity
market may be supported by a rate cut, it has yet to come to terms with the
possibility of Mr Bill Clinton winning the election. The recent sell-off in
healthcare stocks was some indication of the likely knee-jerk reaction of
the markets to a Democratic victory.
Third-quarter earnings figures due in the next few weeks may also be
disappointing, with the notable exception of banks, which are thought to
have made over Dollars 1bn on the foreign exchanges recently. But there are
reasons for optimism. Employment in small businesses is rising. So is
capital spending. There is just the hint that companies are substituting
technology for labour and that the US may eventually experience that rare
event, an investment-led recovery.

FT  05 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: Margin of error
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The question of how to measure an insurance company's financial health will
no doubt figure prominently in any inquest into Municipal Mutual (MMI). It
is clear that tinkering around with the solvency margin - net assets as a
proportion of non-life premiums - does not provide a particularly
satisfactory solution. Premium income can be an unreliable proxy for risk in
a competitive pricing environment, while the ratio as presently calculated
fails to take into account the gearing effect of any movement in investments
or claims reserves. At the end of 1991, for instance, investments and
reserves amounted to respectively four and three times the combined
shareholders' funds of the five quoted composites.
Perhaps refinements are possible, such as a more sophisticated weighting of
assets as is already done for the banks. Regulators in the US have taken
steps in this direction. Risks might also be better differentiated, so that
employers' liability, for instance, is given a more demanding rating than
other mundane types of business. Quarterly reporting (not least in the light
of MMI's delayed and heavily qualified annual report) and verification of
claims reserves by qualified actuaries might also help, though there is a
danger of adding to companies' administrative burdens.
As things stand, though, the Department of Trade and Industry ought to have
sufficient information available, hence suggestions that it was slow to act.
The building society regulator, by contrast, seems to be rather more adept
at picking up problems before it is too late.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Cost of a loaf under threat as rain hits wheat crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK BREAD prices may rise because of a bad harvest and the increased cost of
imports due to the devaluation in sterling.
Wet weather damage in southern England in August has left millers facing
steep increases in the price of wheat used in bread-making.
Mr Peter Baker, president of the National Association of British and Irish
Millers (Nabim), said that wheat for delivery in January was at a record
Pounds 162 a tonne. Before the harvest was disrupted, Nabim was expecting to
pay around Pounds 148 a tonne.
Mr Keith Marsh, sales director of British Bakeries, part of the Rank Hovis
McDougall group, said it was inevitable that any increase in the price of
flour would lead to an increase in the price of bread, but he could make no
specific prediction until it was known how much flour would cost. Other cost
increases also had to be taken into account, he said.
The price of a white sliced loaf in the large supermarkets varies between
39p and 49p and has not been raised for about a year.
John Malcolm of the National Farmer's Union said it was not surprising that
millers were worried about supplies. The premium payable for bread-making
wheat, which yields less tonnage per acre than feed wheat, had not
encouraged farmers to plant it. Millers should contract with farmers to
guarantee a fixed premium for bread-making wheat, he said.
The UK mills about 3.3m tonnes of wheat for bread each year, importing a
shortfall of 500,000 tonnes from other EC countries and Canada. This year,
the UK harvest is likely to provide only 2m tonnes of bread-making quality,
leaving an import requirement of 1.3m tonnes. Canada is also having weather
problems and its export prices are expected to rise by 15 to 20 per cent.
The fall-out from sterling's devaluation is also affecting the UK wheat
market because of widening differences between sterling and the green pound,
part of the EC's system for subsidising agricultural prices.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Brooke's Opera
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
'A VISIT backstage in the Royal Opera House is like stepping back into the
19th century. The glamour of the Victorian style enjoyed by the audiences is
transformed into congestion, dust and overloaded facilities behind the
scenes.' So wrote the Priestley report in its financial scrutiny of the ROH,
published in 1984. Priestley recommended better financial management, better
planning and the furtherance of a long-term development plan.
Almost a decade later, not much has changed. The Opera House is still in
deficit - to the tune of about Pounds 3m: the redevelopment plan remains a
will-o'-the-wisp; and it is unclear to anyone what will happen next, not
least whether the government will come to the rescue.
Last week the ROH released summaries of two reports on its future. One was
by the accountants Price Waterhouse and recommended - yet again - better
management. The other was commissioned by the Arts Council and undertaken by
Baroness Warnock. The most striking fact in what is known of her report is
that she recommended that the development plan in its most ambitious form
should be abandoned.
The Opera House has reacted in characteristic fashion by accepting the need
for greater efficiency, yet sticking to the development plan which, it
hopes, will be met by a mixture of private and public money. The sum
mentioned is sometimes as high as Pounds 250m.
This is a profoundly unsatisfactory situation, likely to lead to nothing but
the prolongation of uncertainty. The time has come, therefore, for someone
to take the lead at the highest level. That can only mean the central
government. There is now a new national heritage secretary in Mr Peter
Brooke. He has the opportunity to devote his first few weeks in office to
sorting out the mess.
Mr Brooke should say that the government will repair the deficit, but that
the grandiose development plan should be ditched. He should insist that good
intentions about better management and budgeting are put into practice,
offer to put up some of the money - perhaps Pounds 15m - for the internal
modernisation of the house as recommended by Lady Warnock and tell the ROH
to go ahead as soon as practicable.
It is sometimes said that even internal redevelopment will take more than a
year. Sceptics should remember one of the lessons of the Falklands war. In
emergency, it turned out to take about a tenth of the time to refurbish a
ship that it did in normal circumstances. That is the sort of approach
required for the crisis at Covent Garden.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Gatt this week
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the EC are threatening a trade war. The Gatt system for managing
trade according to internationally accepted rules is precariously poised.
The time available to settle deepening conflict is dangerously short. More
specifically, if there is no significant breakthrough in farm trade reforms
during meetings on October 10 and 11 between US and EC officials, trade will
be seriously compromised.
Some trade negotiators may not recognise how dangerous a stage negotiations
have reached. EC negotiators may have taken encouragement from the fact that
last Thursday's noon deadline set by Washington for a settlement of the
EC-US oilseeds dispute passed without the immediate imposition of trade
sanctions. If they believe that they have called the US bluff and won, they
are wrong.
Thursday's noon deadline was less to do with oilseed sanctions than with the
US serving notice that is at the end of its tether with the Gatt dispute
settlement system, and is poised to abandon it.
Gatt has twice upheld US complaints over the EC's oilseed subsidy regime.
The Community's attempt to settle the dispute by offering general
compensation may satisfy Gatt obligations, but it fails to deal with the US
domestic pressure for compensation specifically to target oilseed farmers.
The US view is that the Gatt dispute settlement process has been exhausted
by the EC's refusal to meet Thursday's deadline to bow to binding
arbitration - and it must 'draw appropriate conclusions'.
The US position may be inconsistent (it too has failed to comply with Gatt
panel rulings) but its conclusions are clear - unless there is a Uruguay
Round agreement giving the Gatt stronger powers to settle disputes, the US
will in future use its strength unilaterally.
The US already shows an alarming preference for Section 301 of its Trade
Act, which enables it to impose its own sanctions on countries which it
believes are trading unfairly. Most of its trading partners realise that
strong multilateral rules are the only protection against the US using its
trading might to act as judge and jury in trade conflicts.
While the moral tenor of US comments is tiresome, the general point - that a
Uruguay Round settlement is urgently needed to deal with growing strains to
the international trading system - must be well taken. The rising tide of
disputes such as that over oilseeds can only be properly settled within the
context of a wider settlement.
Europe's farm trade regime should never be allowed to ruin the wider
potential benefits - in services trade, protection of intellectual property
rights, and in improved market access - offered by the Uruguay Round. At the
forefront of negotiators' minds this weekend should be that none of the
problems the Uruguay Round is intended to tackle will go away if
negotiations fail.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Appreciating the yen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TIDES from Europe's recent currency turmoil are washing up against
Japanese shores. But the Bank of Japan would be well advised to keep its
sights firmly on Japan's own economic problems. With the economy still
weakening, a further cut in the discount rate is already overdue on domestic
grounds. But any calls for the Bank of Japan to halt, rather than merely
smooth, the appreciation of the yen should be resisted.
The rise in the value of the yen against both the dollar and the D-Mark over
the past few weeks is understandably unwelcome for Japanese companies. Yet
the rise is not merely a short-term spin-off from Europe's difficulties, but
a necessary part of the adjustment process after the excesses of the last
few years.
Over-investment in domestic capacity has left Japan with a distorted
domestic economy and a high and rising current account surplus. Only through
a higher yen can Japan produce the capital outflow needed to balance this
current account surplus and encourage Japan's consumers to buy more imports.
There is little that policy can, or should, do to ease the corporate
sector's pain. What it can do is encourage other sources of activity, other
than investment or exports, to promote growth and soak up labour. That is
why the recent Y10,700bn fiscal package of infrastructure spending was so
timely. That is also why the supplementary budget needed to allow this
spending should be enacted as fast as possible.
Still, the current problems of the corporate sector are not the only, or the
most serious, threat to Japanese economic prospects. More worrying is the
scale of the bad debts, caused by the continuing collapse in land prices,
that look likely to cripple the ability of Japanese banks to speed economic
recovery when investment finally starts to recover.
Policy has not done enough to address this problem. The stock market has
rallied in the belief that the authorities are committed to providing more
than just words and accounting fiddles. But while August's package promised
much, it has so far produced little of substance. The desire of the Ministry
of Finance to avoid using public money to bail out the banking sector is
understandable but misguided. The banks must be seen to suffer for their
past errors. But without some injection of public money to bail out the
banking industry, a sizeable economic recovery will not materialise soon.
The Ministry of Finance cannot afford to wait for another collapse in share
prices before it acts. The proposed land-buying agency, currently being
organised by the banks, is the best way to inject liquidity into the land
market and speed the painful process of writing down the bad debts. But to
be effective, this agency needs much more capital than the banks are in a
position to provide.
The Japanese government should pledge now that low-cost loans, most likely
from the Bank of Japan, will be provided once the agency is established. The
Bank of Japan currently has plenty of room to boost bank profitability and
to stimulate activity by steepening the yield curve. Inflation is low, the
economy is depressed and the appreciation of the yen represents a de facto
tightening of monetary policy. It should cut short term interest rates at
once.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Early end to puerile joy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since John Major spoke about the need to repair the 'fault lines' in the
European Monetary System, there has been some back-pedalling. No real
British reform plan is likely to be presented to the Birmingham Euro-summit,
and the emphasis has changed to the need for so-called economic convergence.
Meanwhile, Norman Lamont's singing in the bath is likely to change to
sobbing in the sink unless the fall in sterling is soon arrested. Amid the
puerile rejoicing of the Euro-sceptics it is not yet realised quite how far
sterling has fallen since Britain's humiliating departure from the ERM.
The situation is reminiscent of 1986, when, as I then pointed out, sterling
was allowed to fall far too much under the pretext of a drop in the oil
price; and the groundwork was laid for the boom and bust cycle we have
suffered ever since.
The big difference is that the 1986 depreciation took place in fits and
starts over a whole year. This time the process has been compressed into
weeks or days - rather in the way that the long drawn-out themes of a
Bruckner slow movement are sometimes then compressed into a brief, frantic
scherzo.
Meanwhile the Treasury is trying to work out some monetary guidelines on the
assumption that the UK is outside the ERM. Indeed one school of thought
there is against Britain returning to the ERM except in the context of a
commitment to full monetary union - which is as likely in present political
circumstances as Norman Lamont dancing a Scottish reel in the middle of
Downing Street.
The pound has been hit by the unseemly row with the Bundesbank and
disappointment at unrealistic hopes of a German interest rate cut last
Friday. At the end of last week sterling had fallen by nearly 18 per cent on
the previous DM2.95 parity. This has more than corrected for any element of
overvaluation in the latter and will nearly all work its way into domestic
inflation.
The best market indicator of expected inflation is the gap between high
coupon long-dated gilts and the indexed variety. This has widened from well
under 4 1/2 per cent to over 5 1/2 per cent - higher than it was before the
election which Labour was expected to win. Forget further early interest
rate cuts over and above the foolish reduction made after ERM departure. The
government will be lucky to avoid a base rate increase before the Tory
conference is over.
Unfortunately, it is becoming clear that ministers are being economical with
the truth in their assertions that the UK did everything possible to remain
in the ERM. They did not raise interest rates when pressure on sterling
built up in August and some officials were recalled from holiday. They did
not even raise them following the lira devaluation; nor even as late as the
afternoon of Tuesday, September 15, when the pressure on sterling began to
be unbearable. Even on the final Wednesday morning they procrastinated for
several hours. The comparison with the actions of the French and Swedish
governments speaks for itself. We still do not know how far the government
ignored advice from the Bank of England and how far that advice itself was
flawed.
It is in any case now clear that the PM and chancellor were not prepared to
raise interest rates in a recession, even temporarily, for the longer-term
gains of staying in the ERM. It was in that case culpably foolish to rely on
hypocritical drum-beating speeches to produce a contrary impression. The
government had plenty of time for a planned temporary withdrawal before the
highly visible benchmark of the French referendum.
Alternatively it could have responded to Bundesbank pleas for realignment,
which every half attentive journalist had been hearing for at least two
years and which Helmut Schlesinger personally conveyed to a high-ranking
British dignitary - who passed it on to John Major - several weeks before
the final storm.
Of course all is not well in an ERM, three of whose members have devalued or
withdrawn. A grown-up decision is needed on whether it is to be an
adjustable band, or a permanent fixing of exchange rates with a view to a
single currency, or a two-speed mixture.
British officials also have some valid technical points - such as the
failure of the divergence indicator to flash for large creditor currencies
to whom smaller currencies are tied, or the fact that Germany did not have
intervention obligations so long as the Belgian franc was 5 basis points
higher in the grid.
More important is said to be the need for compatible combinations of
monetary, exchange rate and fiscal polices among members. But when the
British make such suggestions, they sound like people throwing large stones
in thin glass houses. The UK joined the ERM two years ago without any
attempt at negotiation either of the entry rate or accompanying policies.
The joys of sinking outside are fast disappearing. But the real question is
the conditions on which other members will have Britain back.

FT  05 OCT 92 / A testing of Spanish mettle: The EMS crisis has shaken
confidence in Felipe Gonzalez's economic policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spain's ever youthful prime minister, has the intense,
concentrated air these days of a man who has just stepped back from a
precipice after peering over the edge and contemplating the destruction of
everything he holds dear.
As he prepares to mark the 10th anniversary of his Socialist government
later this month, the prime minister is fighting a desperate battle to
re-establish economic confidence in the face of the crisis in the European
Community. At home, he has to contend with a currency still under pressure
and with financial markets in a state of shock following the 5 per cent
devaluation of the peseta within the European Monetary System three weeks
ago and the Spanish central bank's reintroduction of capital controls. And
in Europe, he is struggling to preserve Spain's position at the heart of the
Community, the foundation stone of the country's efforts to modernise its
economy and consolidate democracy since it joined the EC in 1986.
Mr Gonzalez knows in his heart that the two battles are inextricably linked.
For unless he and his trusted finance minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, can
restore the battered credibility of their domestic economic policies, the
peseta will remain vulnerable. And so long as the peseta is under pressure,
doubts will grow about Spanish policy.
Will Spain be able to meet the exacting standards required for full
participation in the move towards European economic and monetary union? Will
it be consigned to the slow lane of a two-speed Europe? Or will it, along
with Italy and Britain, simply be blown out of the European mainstream by
the markets, with all the debilitating uncertainties which that implies?
Spain, of course, is not Italy. Its economy is much smaller, and its budget
deficit and debts are nowhere near as large. Spain also has the advantage
that Italy does not of a stable, single-party government under a charismatic
leader who, while his party continues to slide in the polls, still commands
strong personal support.
There is just one more problem. A general election is due by October 1993,
and the campaign has already begun. Mr Gonzalez must fight for re-election
at a time of slower economic growth than at any time since the mid-1980s,
with the highest unemployment rate (17-plus per cent) of any EMS member, and
with painful constraints on the public purse.
Doubts persist in some quarters as to whether he has the stomach for it.
When they spoke at length to the Financial Times at the end of last week, Mr
Gonzalez and Mr Solchaga were thus at pains to do several things: reassure
the markets that they intend to resume the path of economic and financial
liberalisation as soon as conditions allow; reaffirm their determination to
keep a tight grip on government spending and inflation in order to bring
Spain's economy up to the mark for European monetary union (Emu); and warn
their EC partners of the dire consequences for Europe and for Spain of any
move to create a multi-speed Community.
'It is a very serious thing to do to begin talking about different speeds of
European integration simply because we are feeling crushed now by the market
turmoil,' says Mr Gonzalez with feeling. 'One has to think about it with
tranquility. I would recommend not voicing opinions that might have to be
changed within three or six months. The sense of insecurity being introduced
into the European Community and the international community day after day
with questions about whether we can take the Maastricht treaty forward is
becoming intolerably expensive politically. What we are doing is
irresponsible.'
The prime minister's frustration is understandable. In the 10 days between
now and the EC emergency summit in Birmingham, Madrid has a fight on its
hands simply to stay in the EMS - the one relatively sure anchor of Spanish
economic policy, notwithstanding the effective 11 per cent devaluation the
peseta has suffered since July. On the one hand, Mr Gonzalez and Mr Solchaga
are anxious that the Bank of Spain move within the next few days to ease its
capital controls, which they fear are severely damaging investor confidence.
If it is to do so without triggering a run on the peseta, it may have to
raise official interest rates - currently 13 per cent.
On the other hand, the government knows it cannot rely solely on the
interest rate weapon. Mr Solchaga is looking urgently for other ways in
which the Community might act to restore confidence in the EMS before the
Birmingham meeting. He wants his EC colleagues to consider a further
realignment of currencies and the pooling of EC central banks' foreign
exchange reserves. But with relations between EC finance ministers and
central banks poisoned by recent events, he is not all that confident of
success.
'In the last few weeks, normal relations among the Community's monetary
authorities, among the ministers, have been lost,' he says despondently. 'It
has become more and more difficult to exchange views frankly.'
Even if EC countries do begin to improve their co-ordination, it may not
fully defuse the attack on the peseta. Rightly or wrongly, the markets are
now also questioning the government's ability to control its own budget,
prompting the Moody's debt rating agency last week, with cruel timing, to
put Madrid's foreign bonds on credit watch.
Neither the prime minister nor Mr Solchaga denies the government has a
serious credibility problem. In the last two years, as Spain's long period
of economic expansion has tailed off, it has badly overshot its spending
targets, disrupting the effort to combat inflation - currently running at
more than 6 per cent a year - and reduce interest rates. To make matters
worse, there was a perception earlier this year that with trade union unrest
increasing over the government's austerity plans, Mr Gonzalez was under
pressure to cut and run, either by calling early elections or by staging an
inflationary pre-election boomlet.
Hence the importance of the 1993 budget, which Mr Solchaga presented last
Tuesday. Mr Gonzalez says it is designed to squash such talk and demonstrate
his absolute resolve to reduce the public sector deficit.
'I remain to be convinced that there is any electoral advantage to be gained
in hiding the truth and not doing what is necessary,' he says. 'If this was
not the case, I would not have presented this budget; I would have called an
election. There is always a credibility problem when a government decides to
control costs. I am not asking for blind faith. What has to be done is to
demonstrate that one is making progress in controlling the deficits, and we
are going to do that rigorously and soon and efficiently.'
To this end, assuming real growth in gross domestic product of just 0.7 per
cent next year after 1.6 per cent this year, the budget aims for a public
sector budget deficit equivalent to around 3.6 per cent of GDP, compared
with an expected outturn of about 4.5 per cent in 1992. Mr Gonzalez insists
that steep cuts this year in unemployment benefit and the health service -
the two main sources of overspending in 1991 and 1992 - mean this target is
achievable. The trouble for Spain, as Mr Gonzalez admits, is that confidence
can not be established overnight.
'It will be harder for the Germans to correct their deficits than for
Spain,' he argues. 'But Germany has a reserve of decades of credibility
while Spain has to fight for its credibility every month and every year.'
Thus far, the best weapon in that fight has been Spain's determination to
keep up with its stronger EC partners through the process of economic and
monetary union. What makes this moment so particularly worrying for Mr
Gonzalez, long a passionate advocate of European integration, is the fact
that this process itself appears to be fragmenting, and that Spain is being
lumped with the laggards rather than the leaders.
There is an unspoken conviction at all levels of government in Madrid that a
two-speed Europe - with a hard core of currencies grouped around the D-Mark
proceeding more rapidly towards Emu - would be a catastrophe not just for
Spain but for the Community. Ministers fear that currencies left out of the
inner circle would have to be protected by a wall of exchange controls and
trade barriers, thus throwing the whole European integration process into
reverse.
Mr Gonzalez's one powerful hope is that this crisis will act as a catalyst
for change. Already the country's combative trade unions, which had been
threatening a general strike this month to protest against unemployment
benefit cuts, are drawing back from confrontation. While the prime minister
insists he is not trying to engineer a formal incomes policy, he would be
delighted if the unions and employers were to find common ground on pay and
productivity for next year.
'In moments of crisis in Spain, the unions have always behaved more
responsibly and not just in the interests of their own members,' he says.
Industrial peace may not be easy to secure in view of the government's
decision to freeze public sector pay next year, but it will be critical to
the effort to prove Spain is capable of putting its house in order. It would
also enable Mr Solchaga to forge ahead with the much-needed structural
reforms he promised in April. The finance minister insists he will bring
bills to parliament in the next few months initiating deregulation of the
labour market, telecommunications, transport, energy and the professions.
None of these reforms, however, will be possible without Mr Gonzalez's
commanding and committed presence at the head of both the government and the
Socialist party. There is no alternative leader at present, within or
outside the Socialist party, but without him all bets on Spain's economy
would be off. Will he stay to fight for re-election next year? His answer is
less equivocal than on some recent occasions.
'People who know me say I respond better to difficult situations than to
easy ones. How do we translate this into politics now? Look, I do not
usually give up when things get tough.'
Mr Gonzalez is wiser, and Spain is much richer, since they last stood
together on a precipice during the industrial crisis which engulfed the
country in 1983. At least on this occasion, with the European Community as a
whole in ferment, he has the consolation of knowing that this not Spain's
crisis alone.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: Arcadian dreams - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea of arcadia has interested me for a long time. 'Arcadia' means a
place of rustic happiness that relies upon nature for its inspiration, but
is itself man made. In his Georgics, Virgil understood the need for men to
be inspired by the seasons, by the moods of nature and by bucolic pleasures
that are not easily at hand in cities. Ancient Romans who went to their
villas wanted to be close to nature, both to observe it and to control it.
Life in the villa was often highly sophisticated, and part of this
sophistication was the affectation of simple rustic values and the
acceptance of the country as a place of innocence and the home of 'truth.'
In England, the development of arcadian ideas is inextricably tied up with
the growth of the culture of the country house and so it is entirely
appropriate that The National Trust should arrange a travelling exhibition
entitled An English Arcadia. This display of drawings and water colours
concerned with the designs of gardens, landscapes and garden buildings comes
mainly from the Trust's collections, selected by Gervase Jackson-Stops, the
Architectural Adviser to the Trust.
The purpose behind the exhibition is to raise funds for the Stowe Landscape
Appeal to restore the landscape and garden buildings of this major example
of English landscape history, which the Trust acquired in 1989. The
exhibition has already toured the US and is currently in London at Hazlitt
Gooden and Fox, Bury Street, St. James's, SW1. It will go on tour in England
later in the year.
Landscape and garden history are fast replacing architecture and interior
design as cult subjects of study. probably. I am sure this is linked to both
the new green consciousness and the economic recession. Almost everyone can
plant a seed, and the national pastime of gardening is now looking for some
academic roots. Planting trees is less expensive, and often more satisfying,
than erecting buildings. If only the one third of the architectural
profession that is currently out of work would take up landscape the world
would rapidly become a richer and greener place.
The drawings and water colours in The English Arcadia exhibition are paper
evidence of a passion for natural order and perfection. The arcadian
sentiment is used to make an evocative title, but the idea of arcadia is,
alas, not really explored at all. However, it is perfectly possible for the
visitor to explore the idea with his own eyes and mind. Indeed, this is the
perfect exhibition for imaginary journeys. There are 125 exhibits, beginning
with 17th century drawings and going on to the 1980's with an example of the
work of Quinlan Terry.
The Westbury Court garden on the banks of the Severn in Gloucestershire is
shown in the form of an engraving by Johannes Kip which was published in
1712. Here you have the contemporary printed evidence for a garden that has
now been restored by the National Trust as the perfect example of a
Dutch-inspired water garden. Westbury was in the hands of a property
speculator in the 1960's and was very nearly lost for ever. Today it
represents a triumph of restoration that has been much helped by the
existence of the contemporary views and the account books that show the
botanical nature of the planting. Westbury is small and perfect. It is still
improving, and its history demonstrates the vulnerability of gardens: they
can so easily completely disappear.
The small but perfect vision of a garden is intriguingly typified by the
drawings by Sir James Thornhill (1675-1734), of sketches for a trompe l'oeil
garden. He proposed a series of painted views to go on the walls of a house
in London's Bloomsbury Square. This is the imaginative vision of a personal
arcadia that would remain imaginary because it would add an illusion of
space to a small town garden. Modern designers please copy. The drawings
were found at the National Trust's property at Erdigg in North Wales.
Plans of great 18th century parks and landscapes are an important element of
this exhibition and they certainly deserve a lot of study. Initially they
just look like trees and grass in plan, but in the catalogues there is often
an accompanying legend that helps you to visualise the full extent of the
changes planned to the English landscape.
Stowe is well represented here by the work of the French artist Jaques
Rigaud, who was invited to England by the landscape designer responsible for
Stowe, Charles Bridgeman. John Claude Nattes is another artist who left
behind hundreds of views of Stowe that will be of enormous value in the
restoration of the landscape and temples. His views have great charm even if
they lack great artistic merit.
There is often more charm than art in many representations of landscape and
garden buildings. It is important to remember that, although the inspiration
for much of the English arcadian vision came from artists like Claude,
Poussin and Watteau, it was often created by gentlemen amateurs and their
gardeners.
There is so much of delight and interest in this exhibition. Humphry Repton,
Edwin Lutyens, William Burgess - they are all represented. If the particular
strengths of the collected drawings lies in the 18th century, that is
because the arcadian spirit was then at its height and had not be swamped by
Romanticism or plantsmanship.
The National Trust has a responsibility for a quite remarkable slice of
artistic and creative history - this exhibition shows how much of the
richness of the vision survives on paper. Much still exists to delight us on
the ground, but we must neverforget how vulnerable this created landscape
actually is.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: The Tempest - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The curtain falls after about thirty seconds of The Tempest at the Bristol
Old Vic. Prospero has ambled on in civvies, slipped into the magic gear, and
wants to prove he can create a sea-storm from degree zero. Why not just
start?
Andrew Hay's production, like many Tempests, shackles itself to the idea
that because the play deals with the nature of theatrical fiction ('Our
revels now are ended . . .'), it is necessarily dramatic. In fact, the play
works best as a small chamber piece, a meditation on redemptive art, and
forgiveness. Derek Jarman's unmatched 1980 film, all whispered hints and
guesses at the play, set the action in the half-light of Prospero's
imaginings.
Here at Bristol, Mick Bearwish's monochrome design is an open tilted
pentangle, fit for a magus, with matching floor-plan. It works best from the
upper galleries, not ground level. Through the pentangle, a raised,
curtained area serves as home to the apparitions and sprites.
But the action fails to create energy within this promising empty space. It
needs to be sharper, more focussed, and better deployed. The opening storm
scene, instead of being a riot of confusion, is a tame cotillion of
courtiers edging along a gangplank, taking turns to speak. This is far from
Ariel's description, 'I flamed amazement.' The closing reconciliation scenes
have the air of an awkward photo-call with no one in charge.
There are thematic problems in the relation between Prospero (Ewan Hooper)
and Miranda (Sally Mais); he is perpetually choleric, and she testily
assertive, straight from Personal Growth therapy. Her character's strength
has subtler springs; the daughter who speaks up to Prospero is not the same
girl who is scared of Caliban, who gives herself to Ferdinand, and who is
wide-eyed at the New World. When Hooper is telling her his life story, he
bows and defers to her; this looks wrong on stage. Coleridge knew that Ariel
and Miranda, too much alike, should be kept apart; this Miranda rivals
Caliban for chutzpah.
Elsewhere a lacklustre court has Richard Mayes' fine, solemn Gonzalo and
Freddie Lees' super, Yorkshire Trinculo as exceptional extremes, with
Sebastian (Simon Walter) as a free radical. However, the production finds a
great resource, which should be more prominently used, in Ariel (Paul
Brennen), Juno (Maria Sherry) and Iris (Tim Kirkus). Sherry and Kirkus dance
an erotic body-sculpture for the wedding masque, suspended over the stage;
and all bring a physicality to the Old Vic Company.
Good ambient music from John O'Hara keeps the magic afoot, and under-used
animation projected onto gauze screens gives the production welcome
diversity. But at present this is not the play which Shakespeare's editor,
Warburton, described as 'the noblest Effort of that sublime and amazing
Imagination.'

Norfolk is one of those few remaining corners of England which still feels
more than a touch primitive. No surprise, then, to learn from C4's Animal
Squad Undercover (9.00) that among the yokels there are still avid followers
of cock-fighting. (How much worse cock-fighting is than, say, factory
farming chickens is a moot point.) The opening part of this trilogy follows
the RSPCA's undercover squad in its dogged but ultimately frustrated effort
to see justice done to the cock-fighters.
BBC 2's Out of Darkness (7.50), the consistently interesting series on the
troubles of African states, tonight reaches the Cameroons, whose footballers
with their wonderful pelvic-thrusting dances provided quite the most
memorable moments of the last World Cup - not excepting Gazza's blubbing.
C4's late-night theme is a highly praised Mexican historical epic, Cabeza de
Vaca (12.00), based on the memoirs of an eponymous 16th-century conquistador
in Florida. Captured by an Indian tribe, de Vaca is brought to realise that
the Indians' moral code is superior to that of the Spaniards.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Arts: Don Giovanni - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The latest English National Opera Don Giovanni delivers a great deal more
than on paper it promised to. The cast, with newcomers to the Jonathan
Miller production ranked alongside old hands, has not been schooled to
impeccable vocal stylishness - only one singer, Glenn Winslade (an admirable
and under-used tenor) as Ottavio, attains anything like the velvet-glove
Mozart standard. The conductor, Andrew Greenwood, is lively, at times a bit
brusque over rhythmic definition. The staging, now in the care of Francesca
Joseph, goes well, in a rather obvious way; Miller's invention of a dark
theatrical world, Goya-inspired and lit by flares of intellectual
penetration, has been considerably diluted.
But it is a performance of the opera freshly alert to the knots of
relationship tied and untied during the opera's course. The leading septet
is full of 'real people' - characters whose skins were (one feels) already
fully inhabited before the curtain went up. Peter Coleman-Wright (the
dashingly sardonic Giovanni) and Arwel Huw Morgan (the wrily witty
Leporello), veterans of the previous revival, play to and with each other in
excellently knowing fashion. Lesley Garrett's Zerlina, spunky, gullible and
tender, is more adorable than ever, opposite the strong new Masetto of
Christopher Purves.
Most interestingly of all, the two female aristocrats are embodied and sung
with unusual boldness and determination. Helen Field (Anna) and Linda McLeod
(Elvira) both have appealing but at times unwieldy Mozart sopranos; the fact
that both confront their difficulties rather than skating round them lends
an edge of excitement to everything they sing. In the Coliseum, an
unsuitably large theatre for Mozart, it is a rare and pleasurable event when
Don Giovanni comes alive as vigorously it did on Thursday.
In repertory at the Coliseum until November 5

RESULTS DUE
MORE bad news from the recession in construction, property and housing
sectors is expected on Thursday with three victims reporting results.
Higgs and Hill took exceptional charges of Pounds 20.9m and reported a
pre-tax loss in the year to December 31, and is expected to post minimal
interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 500,000-Pounds 800,000. The interim
dividend will likely be slashed to 1.5p (6p).
Ibstock Johnsen, the brick and building materials manufacturer, has also
been having a tough time. Interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m
(Pounds 7.2m) are forecast. Its interim dividend also looks under pressure
and could be cut to 1p or even a halfpenny (2.25p). However hopes are
brighter for Tilbury Douglas. Interim profits of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 6.7m)
are expected and the 10 1/2 p dividend looks safe. The company is expected
to maintain its reputation as one of the few in the construction sector to
be coming through the recession relatively unscathed.
Grampian Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate which set the ball rolling
in the bidding for Macarthy last year, is expected to show on Wednesday an
interim profit on its continuing activities of Pounds 2.5m, down from Pounds
3.4m.
The picture is complicated by the sale of the Mitre business, maker of
footballs and other sporting goods. The largest part of Grampian is the
animal pharmaceuticals division. The performance of the tourist retailing
side is traditionally biased towards the second half.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Economics: Indicators hint at German slowdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week sees the first of the monthly string of statistics on the German
real economy. They are expected to show that the west German economy is in
mild recession with manufacturing orders and industrial production falling
and unemployment rising.
As the west German economy has slowed, employment growth has also eased.
Unemployment, which has been rising steadily since the beginning of the
year, is expected to increase by 20,000. Most forecasters believe it will
continue rising for the rest of the year.
In the UK the economic highlight of the week is last month's retail prices
index. The figure is due to be released on Friday morning, shortly before Mr
John Major, the prime minister, rises to address the Conservative Party at
the end of its annual conference in Brighton. Any inflationary effects of
sterling's recent devaluation will not yet have fed through to the index, so
at least on his inflationary record, Mr Major should have little explaining
to do.
The following are some of the other economic highlights and events of the
week. The figures in brackets - from MMS International - are the median of
economists' forecasts.
Today: Luxembourg, EC foreign ministers' meeting; UK, August credit
business; Denmark, August current account (DKr1.5bn); US, September 21-30
car sales (6.2m); Canada, September Bank of Canada reserves (-CDollars 4bn).
Tomorrow: US, Federal open markets committee meeting in Washington; Germany,
September unemployment - west (up 20,000), August employment - west (up
10,000), September vacancies - west (down 5,000), September unemployment -
east (down 19,000), September short time work - east (down 14,000). UK,
Conservative party conference opens in Brighton. Wednesday: US, August
wholesale trade, August consumer credit (Dollars 1bn repayment); Australia,
October consumer sentiment, August leading indicators. Thursday: US, initial
claims week ended September 26 (420,000), state benefits week ended
September 19, money supply data for week ended September 28; Canada,
September housing starts (up 165); Australia, September unemployment rate
(11 per cent), September employment (down 2,500); Germany, parliamentary
debate on Maastricht in Bonn.
Friday: UK, September retail prices index (up 0.3 per cent on month, up 3.5
per cent on year), excluding mortgages (up 4 per cent on year); Norway,
September CPI (up 2.3 per cent on year); Sweden, September unemployment
rate, September trade balance; Canada, September employment growth (up 0.1
per cent), September unemployment rate (11.6 per cent), August motor vehicle
sales, August department store sales (down 0.5 per cent; Australia, award
pay rates for August; US, FOMC minutes of August 18 meeting released in
Washington.
During the week: Germany, August manufacturing orders (down 0.5 per cent),
August trade balance (DM1bn surplus), August current account (DM5bn
deficit); France, August M3 (up 0.4 per cent); Switzerland, September
consumer prices index (up 3.7 per cent on year).

FT  05 OCT 92 / Management: Workers who want to make the grade / A look at
an innovative IBM retraining programme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Adrianne Goodman, a worker at IBM's printed circuit board plant in Austin,
Texas, was less than enthusiastic when it was first suggested she should
take some maths lessons. 'I had been here for 10 years and I did not see why
I should go back to school,' she says. Goodman was only convinced when the
lessons allowed her to take on more responsibility.
'There used to be process technicians everywhere in here. They used to run
the place,' she says. These days, workers exert more control over how the
plant runs. 'I feel I am a part of it,' she says. Like the other retrained
workers, Goodman is now known as a technical associate.
IBM's effort at Austin is a rare beacon of hope for the corporation as it
tries to raise profitability: the plant's success shows that investment in
skills can improve profits. Yet it is still moving away from its tradition
of employment security: it expects to cut its worldwide workforce by about
40,000 this year through voluntary reductions.
The company has a number of measures for the success of the training
initiative. It says that productivity has doubled in the panel plant and at
a nearby card assembly plant, where the components are assembled on boards.
It also estimates that stockpiles have been reduced by 40 per cent,
production has increased and there has been a 5 per cent quality
improvement.
The re-education effort at Austin was launched in 1985, when the plant's
future was in doubt. The plant's quality was low, it was over-staffed -
three workers carried out indirect tasks, such as engineering maintenance,
for every one direct production worker - and it was estimated to be losing
Dollars 60m (Pounds 33.7m) a year. It needed fewer, but more skilled,
workers.
Because production methods were then unsophisticated, IBM could instead have
relocated to a lower-wage economy such as Mexico and employed the same
number of workers more cheaply. But Abe Clay, plant manufacturing manager,
says its tradition of retaining workers made that option unlikely.
IBM instead decided to use the plant as a test-site for a work
re-organisation plan known as Manufacturing Technical Associates (MTA).
The principle was to combine a cut in the indirect workforce with
re-training for the others so they could take on broader tasks. The hope was
that the newly-educated workers could both improve quality levels and cut
the cycle times.
The company devised a new job structure, based on seven grades, cutting out
more than 200 former job classifications.
Those on the lowest grade spend more than 90 per cent of their time on
production work, and the remainder on technical tasks such as materials
analysis. As the worker acquires more skills, and higher pay, the
proportions gradually alter.
Even those in the first grade required mastery of basic statistical process
control and systems administration, along with production and technical
skills. This required up to 40 hours of skill-based classroom training, as
well as basic maths and reading for those who needed to supplement
inadequate or ill-remembered high school classes.
Clay says any deficiency in basic education was less striking than the
untapped potential of the 800-strong direct workforce. 'There were a lot of
people who you would have said were incapable of doing this or that until
you tested it. It made me think that we have not really tapped the resident
skills of a lot of the workforce,' he says.
However, the change in work style is not entirely painless. Jerry Schiappa,
a Grade 5 worker, says the new structure has clarified what was previously a
murky grading system and made explicit what the company expects of workers.
'It tells me my limitations. It is the first time I have known what I need
to do to get to the next level,' he says.
Although the grade structure provides a single ladder to move to what would
formerly have been supervisory work, the degree of specialisation increases
at the fourth level.
Workers then specialise either in technical manufacturing or quality
control, acquiring a series of skill modules. This has allowed IBM to cut
materials handlers and engineers.
Clay says quality control standards have improved markedly. 'We are
identifying Dollars 250,000 of products each year that we would have shipped
out before, but we are just not accepting any more,' says Clay. Like
Motorola, which has also been praised for training and education efforts
linked to quality improvement, the IBM plant is trying to reduce flaws to
below one in a million within two years.
The quality improvement drive has provided the clearest incentive for IBM to
invest in re-education and training, and to that extent, the demand for
higher skills is unlikely to abate. IBM has now put about two-thirds of its
30,000 direct workers through the MTA programme, or similar initiatives in
other plants.
Clay says quality is the clearest benchmark for assessing whether the
investment in education was worthwhile - a difficult calculation to make.
'There has been a dramatic shift in the quality curve. Some of that is
design and engineering, but a big piece of quality comes from what a person
does every day,' he says.
The company has tried to stimulate interest in quality improvement through a
separate initiative under which any worker can form a team of around 10
people to solve a particular problem. Each gets a bonus for identifying a
problem and working on it: the three teams which are judged to have solved
most each year receive Dollars 15,000.
Yet despite the plaudits won by the effort at Austin, the future of such
initiatives is made less certain by IBM's corporate restructuring efforts.
Given the strong pressures to reduce costs - IBM is planning to reduce costs
and expenses by Dollars 4bn a year, beginning in 1993 - and its efforts to
cut staff, training investments will inevitably come under scrutiny.
Paul Osterman, professor of human resources and management at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, says companies such as IBM which have
pursued 'full employment' policies have had a strong motive to invest in
skills. Because they have not been able to hire and fire at will, they have
been forced to think carefully about how to use employees.
Osterman says the future of investments like the MTA programme is vital if
US industry is to move towards an industrial model based on workers allowing
job flexibility in return for job security and investments in training.
The alternative is that more manufacturing plants may end up moving from
Texas towards the pool of cheaper labour south of the Mexican border.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Management: Some tender memories of the Bundesbank - Power
lunching
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of the Metallgesellschaft mining,
metals and engineering group, is exceptional among senior Frankfurt
businessmen in that he enjoys going out for a business lunch.
His chauffeur drives him to his favourite Italian restaurant 10 minutes from
the centre of the town and, while his body-guards wait outside,
Schimmelbusch commands a corner of the room, orders the food and launches
into a lively discussion of his plans for the company, and much else
besides.
Schimmelbusch's willingness to go out to lunch perhaps dates back to early
in his career when - already marked out for great things - he spent some
time working in New York with a Wall Street investment bank and became used
to more relaxed eating habits than are the norm in Germany.
Top businessmens' diaries are booked up years in advance and they simply do
not have the time, or the inclination, to go out. As Hellmut Hartmann, chief
press spokesman for the Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest bank, explains, the
bank's main board directors tend to have a bowl of soup and sandwiches at
their desks as they get on with their work.
Of course, main board directors - the Gods of the German financial world -
have the facilities to entertain honoured guests. Sal Oppenheim, the private
bank, is reputed to have the most exquisite cuisine of all the banks in
Frankfurt: unfortunately this correspondent cannot pass judgment on the
quality of the food there, having not (yet) received an invitation. He can,
however, vouch for the tenderness of the wild boar occasionally served at
the Bundesbank.
One step down from board level, bankers must eat canteen food, palatable and
cheap, but canteen food all the same. The most senior have their own dining
rooms but, again, get canteen food.
Despite all this, there is a lively restaurant scene in Frankfurt. Eating
out is mainly the preserve of the large community of intermediaries -
brokers, lawyers, advertising executives and public relations people - and
it is done predominantly when foreigners come to town.
It is a strange fact that, but for one or two notable French and German
restaurants, the bulk of restaurants in this city are Italian. The
proprietor of the local pizzeria suggests that there are 560 outlets for
Italian food in the city of Frankfurt alone, and many more in dormitory
towns such as Kronberg, Konigstein and Bad Homburg.
Of these, a dozen or more are excellent restaurants where one can eat
exquisite food at what - by the standards of other world financial centres -
is a reasonable price. Many of these are clustered in the Westend, the
elegant residential and office district five minutes away from the financial
centre. The restaurants are informal, one can take off one's jacket and sit
outside when the sun is shining.
Michele Castagno has run Florian, one of the most popular Italian
restaurants of this class, for the last 12 years.
He says that up to half his customers at any given lunchtime are
non-Germans. Most do not appear to have met their lunch partners before, and
Castagno notices a perceptible relaxing of tension as the meal proceeds, the
wine begins to take effect, and client and customer began to feel at ease
with one another.
At lunchtime, 60-80 per cent of Castagno's customers eat fish. There is a
choice of 60 wines, although most of the customers drink no more than one or
two glasses, with many drinking nothing but water.
A typical light meal would consist of mushrooms or carpaccio (raw meat)
followed by veal, fish or a mixed pasta dish, rounded off with fruit salad
and a cup of coffee.
The menu (above) is on a grander scale, but it would not finish off either
wallet or stomach: four fine courses would cost no more than DM100 (Pounds
40) per person (without wine) and you ought to be able to stroll round the
corner afterwards to have a meeting at 3pm without needing a siesta.
However excellent and varied, Italian food can begin to pall if one is
obliged to eat out two or three times a week. There are one or two good
French restaurants (Erno's Bistro, for example, near the Palmengarten) and
Humperdinck earns its Michelin Star for its fine 'international' and French
food.
Serious business is not discussed over lunch, at least not in public. It is
however an important topic when top businessmen get together for drinks
parties in the evening.
It is probably harder to get an invitation to one of these parties, than to
be invited to lunch at Sal Oppenheim.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Newcastle zone strives to retain assisted-area status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSISTED-AREA status at-tracted the Norwegian company Grorud to Consett,
County Durham, in 1981, the year after the town lost its steelworks and
became a symbol of the last manufacturing recession.
Aided by grants, Grorud has since become one of Consett's biggest companies,
with 330 employees, diversifying successfully beyond door and window
fittings, its original business, into stair lifts and precision engineering.
Thanks to Consett's development-area status Grorud has received aid
totalling Pounds 1.5m towards a total capital spend of Pounds 5m. The
company, whose Consett operations will this year turn over Pounds 20m, is
expanding there and has bought land beside its factories for another
development, pencilled in for 1994. Its target is to increase its Consett
payroll to 500.
Now it is waiting to see whether the Newcastle travel-to-work area, which
includes Consett, wins its fight to remain a development area. If, as is
locally feared, it is demoted to intermediate-area status, offering lower
grants, the timescale of the Pounds 1m expansion would be affected, Mr David
D'Arcy, Grorud's finance director, says.
'We'd have to defer it, we'd have to generate sufficient retained earnings
to fill the gap,' he says. He would, he says, be looking to DA grants to
cover 30 per cent to 35 per cent of the cost.
Grorud exemplifies the pulling power of DA status. Its Oslo-based parent,
wanting a British base to sell into the European Community, selected Consett
from a number of DAs.
Economic development bodies and local authorities in the Newcastle area
estimate that regional selective assistance since 1984 has totalled Pounds
68m, creating or safeguarding more than 19,000 jobs.
In 1984-89, the area suffered a net loss of 9,600 manufacturing jobs. In
Derwentside, which includes Consett, Mr John Pearson, industrial development
officer, estimates that four fifths of today's industrial jobs were created
in the 1980s.
The worry locally is that the government will base its review solely on a
'snapshot' of present unemployment rates. In that league table, the
Newcastle travel-to-work area has slipped to about 60th place out of 322, as
other areas have risen because of the recession.
Newcastle area's case is that its structural economic difficulties are far
from solved - it points to high long-term and under-25s unemployment.
Demotion from DA status, it is argued, would undermine the job-creating
potential of public-sector developments to which more than Pounds 600m
investment has been committed.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Regions in search of aid: South joins clamour once dominated
by the north - High unemployment reported in Ilfracombe and Isle of Wight /
The redrawing of the funding map
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is redrawing its map of assisted areas, the regions classed
as 'development' or 'intermediate' that qualify for financial support.
Businesses and councils affected by the recession have been lobbying
eloquently for bigger slices of the overall assistance cake.
But the signs are that the scope and size of assistance will be cut just
when many regions feel justified in demanding more of it. The period for
applications has just ended, and a new map, first promised in 1988, might be
published by the end of the year after consultations with the European
Commission.
Councils and businesses fear the areas might be reduced and the methods of
payment made more restrictive.
'It is unlikely that the coverage of the new map will be greater than now,
and it could be somewhat less,' the government said in a consultation paper
in June.
The government may also take the opportunity to alter the methods of
funding.
Mr Tim Sainsbury, the industry minister, indicated in Birmingham last week
that changes might go beyond the redrawing of the map.
In the past regional aid has been directed mainly at towns caught up in
industrial decline or industrial restructuring. But the recession has
changed the geographical pattern of unemployment, providing some southern
regions with a strong case for inclusion on the map.
Unemployment percentages on the Isle of Wight, for example, are as high as
those in the Newcastle upon Tyne travel-to-work area, which includes parts
of Tyneside, Northumberland and County Durham. And the decline of
unemployment since 1984, according to analysis by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the
accountants, has been much faster in the old blackspots of south Wales than
it has been in Southampton or Portsmouth.
Because state subsidies are involved and because the subsidies impinge on
the EC's competition rules, the government needs approval of its new map
from Brussels.
The availability of EC funding, added to the plethora of UK regeneration
instruments introduced since 1979 - enterprise zones, urban development
corporations, derelict land grants and so on - has diminished the immediate
financial importance of domestic regional aid, which is paid through two
main channels:
Regional selective assistance, designed to improve employment opportunities
and aimed at projects that would not go ahead without some subsidy. It is
frequently used as a carrot to attract inward investment.
Regional enterprise grants, designed to help small companies with product
and plant development.
Total government spending on such schemes has fallen from Pounds 518.2m in
1984-85 to Pounds 264.6m in 1991-92. That is not simply because the
government has tightened its purse strings. It is also the result of a
policy switch in the mid 1980s: the system of automatic entitlement to funds
for projects in the assisted areas through the regional development grant
was abandoned in favour of discretionary funding, where projects are
examined case by case before a commitment is made to support them.
Regional aid from UK funds is spread over areas designated in 1984, most of
which are north of a line drawn from The Wash to the Severn estuary, which
accounts for 35 per cent of the working population of Britain.
The officials working on the new map, just as with the existing map, will
use unemployment as their main yardstick in deciding whether an area should
be on the map. But they have no precise formula. It is not known how much
weight they attach to actual unemployment figures relative to long-term
unemployment figures, or, indeed, to potential unemployment figures.
Against that background, the regions have been marshalling some widely
differing cases. Northern Development Company, for north-east England and
Cumbria, emphasises that it has the highest regional rate of unemployment in
Britain, that only inward investment can strengthen a weak economic base and
such investment will not be attracted without assisted-area status.
The Isle of Wight emphasises its persistent unemployment and a fragile
economic base.
Telford in Shropshire wants to retain assisted-area status because its
workforce is growing so quickly that it cannot be absorbed by expansion of
local companies, so it needs assistance to draw inward investment.
There is no evidence that, in working its way through the competing claims
of disadvantage, the government is examining the fundamental purpose of
regional policy.
There has been no debate on the extent to which the existing instruments of
regional policy work towards what the government defines as its broad
objective: 'to reduce regional imbalances in employment opportunities'.
The fact that, for example, northern England complains of 'structural
unemployment for 60 years' and over the past 20 years a rate of unemployment
'50 per cent above the average for Great Britain', raises the obvious point
of whether there is value in the existing instruments of regional policy.
Is the flaw in the instruments or does fault lie elsewhere? Should regional
policy be redefined?
Absence of such debate suggests that the new map will be changed by
tinkering, perhaps taking out parts of Wales and Cheshire, perhaps inserting
parts of the East Midlands, southern coastal areas, north Kent, and the
Essex and Lincolnshire coasts.
There is also the political map to be considered. Broadly, if the government
stays with the existing map, it will benefit Labour areas - while if it
spreads the map into the south, it will benefit Tory areas.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Big rise in jobless at Devon resort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ILFRACOMBE, the north Devon resort, is the unexpected name at the top of the
national league table for the sharpest increase in unemployment over the
past year. The town hopes to regain the status of assisted area that it lost
eight years ago.
Parts of Devon face heavy unemployment because of cuts in traditional
industries and because of the absence of government incentives to attract
new jobs.
Local authorities have applied for the retention of assisted-area status in
Plymouth and the restoration of such status in four zones: Barnstaple and
Ilfracombe, Bideford, Torbay and Totnes.
Unemployment in Ilfracombe is running at 22 per cent and the increase over
the past year has been 36.6 per cent. The story of Ilfracombe indicates the
significance of assisted-area status and its impact on a local economy.
From 1966 to 1982, virtually the whole of north Devon enjoyed
development-area status, and a number of new industries were attracted to
the area. From 1982, only Ilfracombe retained full development-area status.
Since 1984, no incoming manufacturing companies have gone to the town
because of the lack of government grants and incentives, while the staple
source of work, tourism, has been affected by structural changes in holiday
habits.
There has been a change away from peak season resort-based visitors towards
self-catering. The number of bedspaces in hotels and guest houses in
Ilfracombe dropped by 40 per cent between 1976 and 1991. A big obstacle that
needs tackling is the poor infrastructure, particularly access by road,
which is especially difficult in the crowded summer months.

THE MID WALES Rural Development Forum has urged the government to extend the

The forum - comprising the Development Board for Rural Wales, the three
county councils in its area, five district councils and three Training and
Enterprise Councils - is a lobbying group for more business investment in
rural mid Wales.
Four areas in mid Wales have assisted-area status: around Brecon and south
of Cardigan are development areas; while north-west Meirionnydd and parts of
Ystradgynlais, above Swansea, are lower-rated intermediate areas.
The rest of rural mid Wales, which has suffered in the past few years from
the drop in farming income, is not designated for any form of assistance.
The forum is pressing for the upgrading of north-west Meirionnydd, around
the Trawsfynydd nuclear power station, which is threatened with closure with
the loss of some 600 jobs, to development-area status.
Mr RO Lewis, chairman of the forum, said there was 'a special case for
north-west Meirionnydd, given the area's dependence on the power station'.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Broad support found for Cadbury proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY TWO THIRDS of directors, stockbrokers and auditors support the
proposal to require companies to disclose their level of compliance with the
Cadbury code on corporate governance, a survey showed yesterday.
Two thirds also believe that self-regulation is better than statutory
enforcement in improving the way companies are run.
The study of 354 senior executives is published in the latest edition of the
Arthur Andersen Corporate Register.
The Cadbury committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance
reported during the summer and is due to publish a revised version before
the end of the year.
One of its suggestions is that all companies should be required to show
compliance with its code of practice as a condition for a stock market
listing.
In an indication of dissatisfaction with the present situation, only 23 per
cent of the survey believed leading institutional shareholders already
carried out many of the functions proposed by Cadbury for non-executive
directors, such as scrutiny of other board members.
Just over half believed that financial markets would provide tougher
sanctions than external regulators against companies failing to reach
accepted standards of corporate governance.
Smaller companies disagreed more strongly with the Cadbury recommendations
such as the compulsory establishment of audit committees, arguing that they
would introduce costly additional expense and bureaucracy. More than half
agreed with the statement that the role of chairman and chief executive
should be split, and almost as many that annual accounts should split
directors' remuneration between salary and performance-related pay.
Sixty per cent agreed with the Cadbury suggestion that audit committees
should be composed entirely of non-executive directors.
Only half the companies responding had an audit committee, and nearly a
quarter of those that did said it met just once each year. Only 9 per cent
of those said its terms of reference resembled those proposed.
Of those that had audit committees, more than two fifths said they had a
beneficial effect on company performance. Two thirds of companies had a
remuneration committee, of which about half met once each year. Most of
those were constituted as recommended by Cadbury.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Cleaning up the city of Birmingham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM has started to primp and preen for next week's European Council
meeting in the city, Paul Cheeseright writes.
'The first thing to say is we're going to try and make Birmingham the
capital of Europe for four days,' the City Council promised.
Away go the graffiti, out come more fresh flowers. Underpasses that have
depressed and frightened pedestrians for two decades will be hung with
banners. Streets will be extra clean.
Birmingham Mint is producing special bronze coins: city arms on one side,
the symbol of the UK's Community presidency on the other. A special flag
will fly: 12 stars with 'Birmingham' in the middle.
The city expects about 4,000 people to attend the summit. The Foreign Office
thinks the figure will be more like 3,000: 750 from the delegations and
about 2,000 from the media.
They will converge on the new International Convention Centre, an
appropriate place for the summit because the EC met about a quarter of the
costs of building it.
Journalists who do not arrive early enough will probably be guided into the
nearby National Indoor Arena to provide a spectacle in the interregnum
between Torvill and Dean and an all-stops-out Carmen.

FT  05 OCT 92 / DTI to seek responses on debt delays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is shortly to issue a public
consultation document on a requirement for companies to publish in their
accounts how promptly they pay their bills.
The document comes in response to comments in the March Budget speech in
which Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, promised action to reduce late
payment for small businesses. It follows growing concern from small
businesses that they are facing severe financial difficulties because larger
companies are delaying payments for several months to conserve their own
cash.
Officials are expecting a paper to be ready for circulation within weeks,
examining options on how to provide the data and where it should be
published. They are keen to strike a balance between the provision of
information and a concern that its preparation should not be too demanding.
Calls for action on late payment of debts are likely to be renewed at this
week's Tory conference. The government has come under considerable pressure
to bring forward such legislation, but is not convinced that new offences
and litigation offer a way forward.
Ministers will undertake to look further at possible solutions once results
are available from three pilot projects on dealing with late payment, and
after the publication of an overdue European Community consultation paper on
the issue, expected in January.
Mr Lamont said in his Budget speech that the government planned to amend the
1985 Companies Act to require large companies to state in their annual
reports and accounts how quickly they pay their bills. The aim was to
introduce the legislation during the current session of parliament, subject
to the outcome of consultation.
Mr Lamont emphasised that government departments were taking commitments to
prompt payment seriously, and would require that their prime contractors to
pay sub-contractors normally within 30 days of receipt of a valid invoice.
The DTI has recently made grants as promised in the Budget to three trade
organisations to run one-year pilot programmes such as telephone hotlines to
help cope with late-payment difficulties.

   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN TIMES as many senior executives of quoted British companies are
chartered accountants as are engineers or surveyors, the latest edition of
the Arthur Andersen Corporate Register, published by Hemmington Scott,
shows.
From a database of more than 15,000 directors and senior officers in the
2,000 quoted companies, 2,100 or nearly 15 per cent are qualified
accountants.
Just over 200 are either chartered engineers or surveyors, while only 41
have MBA degrees.
Less than 3 per cent of the total are women, and less than 5 per cent of
them hold executive directorships.
Nearly 900 went to Oxford or Cambridge University, and the single most
common school - with 194 former pupils - was Eton.
There are 730 with some sort of honour, including 320 with the CBE, 347
knights and 104 lords. There are also two princes and two reverends with
positions on boards.
The average male director is aged 53. The oldest is Lord Shawcross, the
non-executive director of Caffyns and a director of the Observer, who is 90.
The youngest, at 26, is Mr Jean-Jacques Murray, director of US operations
for Nu-Swift. Golf is the most popular recreation, which was mentioned by
1,532 people.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Maxwell inquiry arrest expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON and NICK KOCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SERIOUS Fraud Office is expected to arrest and charge a fourth man early
this week in connection with the Maxwell affair.
An arrest may arise from the arm of the SFO inquiry which is concentrating
on the movement of money from the pension funds into the private companies
in the Maxwell empire. This is one of five lines in the SFO investigation.
It is uncertain whether an arrest would take place with police raiding the
man's house early in the morning in front of television cameras, as happened
when Mr Kevin Maxwell, Mr Ian Maxwell and Mr Larry Trachtenberg were
arrested in June this year.
So far, the two Maxwell brothers and Mr Trachtenberg, a financial adviser to
the late Robert Maxwell, have been charged with a total of 15 counts of
theft and conspiracy to defraud involving Pounds 135m.
Mr Kevin Maxwell faces two counts of conspiracy to defraud and six of theft.
Mr Trachtenberg faces two of conspiracy to defraud and four of theft. Mr Ian
Maxwell faces a charge of conspiracy to defraud.
All three are due to make their next court appearances on December 1.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Fiat to keep Basildon factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIAT IS committed to keeping the former Ford tractor factory at Basildon,
Essex, as one of the main plants in its worldwide agricultural equipment
business, said Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer at the Italian
vehicle producer.
The plant, which produces diesel engines and undertakes final assembly of
Ford tractors, was acquired by Fiat as part of last May's merger of Ford and
Fiat's agricultural and construction equipment businesses, to form NH
Geotech.
Fiat is the 12th-largest non-British company in the UK with 8,000 employees
last year. Employment at Basildon has fallen from about 2,800 in 1991 to
just under 2,000. Most of the cuts were made last September when a fall-off
in sales of agricultural vehicles, especially in Europe, led to 650 job
losses.
Speaking in London, Mr Garuzzo said Fiat intended to retain the twin-track
strategy for Basildon - producing tractors and also engines for use on NH
Geotech equipment.
New products would be developed, and investment in the plant was assured, he
said.
The Fiat executive said there would be further rationalisation elsewhere in
NH Geotech, although the company hoped to avoid plant closures.

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique and Mr Afonso Dhlakama, the leader
of the rebel Mozambique National Resistance (Renamo) movement, yesterday
signed a treaty ending the country's 16-year civil war, which has crippled
it economically and left over 1m people dead.
The treaty, signed at the Italian Foreign Ministry in Rome, marks the end of
the last big conflict in southern Africa, which began shortly after
Mozambique's independence from Portugal in 1975.
The two sides agreed to a ceasefire, which should come into force as soon as
the treaty is approved by the Mozambique parliament later this week.
Under the terms of the deal, weapons will be handed over to the United
Nations and all armed groups are to be disbanded within six months. A
restructured armed force is to be created, made up of around 30,000 fighters
taken equally from both sides.
The Mozambique army and rebel forces must assemble at pre-determined
locations around the country within a month of the treaty being ratified. To
encourage fighters to participate, UN soldiers supervising the ceasefire
will hand out food supplies at the assembly points.
Big aid donors to Mozambique will meet for a conference within a month,
while Zimbabwean soldiers guarding two strips of territory between their
landlocked country and Mozambique's ports will have to leave in the same
period.
At a formal ceremony at the Rome ministry, Mr Chissano heralded the
beginning of a 'new era' for Mozambique.
Mr Chissano said general and presidential elections would take place in
Mozambique and called on UN representatives to help supervise the peace and
electoral process. The deal concludes negotiations which began in July 1990
and reached a first agreement on limited ceasefire in December that year.

<TEXT>
THE US has given a written commitment to maintain present levels of military
aid to Israel, in a move interpreted by the Israeli government as evidence
that Washington will continue to bolster the Jewish state's regional
qualitative military advantage.
The assurance, contained in a letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin from
acting secretary of state Lawrence Eagleburger, followed last month's
package of military assistance for Israel to help offset Israeli objections
to the proposed US sale of up to 72 F-15 fighter aircraft to Saudi Arabia.
The package, including the supply of Apache and Blackhawk helicopters and
'prepositioning' of US military equipment in Israel, was in addition to the
Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 1bn) Israel receives in annual military aid from the
US. It is the latter that Mr Eagleburger promised to maintain. It amounts to
almost half of all US annual foreign military aid. Israel is permitted to
spend almost Dollars 500m on procurement from its own military industries.
Israeli officials are extremely pleased with these developments. They said
they believed the commitments would be honoured regardless of who won the US
presidential election next month.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Kuwaiti PM to open files on Iraqi invasion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KUWAIT'S most actively fought election campaign closed this weekend with
Sheikh Saad al-Sabah, the crown prince and prime minister, promising to
'open the files' on the government's conduct leading up to the Iraqi
invasion in August 1990 while lending his support for extending the vote to
women.
Sheikh Saad's attempt to address some demands by Kuwait's opposition groups
came in a television and radio broadcast on Saturday night in which he also
denied claims that the government was seeking to weaken the country's
constitution.
His remarks were the first public response to government critics from any
member of the ruling al-Sabah family in the campaign. Kuwait's 81,400
eligible voters go to the polls this morning to elect a 50-seat National
Assembly, the first full parliament since the emir suspended the last in
1986.
The assembly has limited powers to initiate and veto legislation and can
summon, and in some cases sack, ministers.
Responding to repeated calls at rallies throughout the campaign, Sheikh Saad
said: 'We will not stand against going into the file of August 2 1990, in
the light of persistent demands to open this file.'
Opposition groups, and many independent candidates, have argued that the
government should be called to account for what they regard as government
complacency before the Iraqi invasion and for the apparent unpreparedness of
the Kuwaiti armed forces.
Sheikh Saad also said he favoured extending the vote to Kuwait's women, 52
per cent of the population, who have led an unprecedented campaign to win
the franchise. But he said that this and other opposition demands to lower
the voting age to 18 and enfranchise naturalised Kuwaitis should be left to
the next parliament.
Despite widespread opposition allegations that the government has directly
financed some of the 278 candidates, a self-appointed election watchdog
yesterday said the election campaign had been substantially free and fair.

FT  05 OCT 92 / US in bid to calm Angola after poll: Attempts to keep a
defeated Unita involved in the peace process
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US South Africa and other western observers to Angola's peace process
were trying to defuse tension in the rebel Unita movement yesterday as it
became clear that President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and the ruling MPLA
party had won the war-shattered country's first democratic elections.
A diplomatic offensive was under way to keep Unita locked into the process,
following an inflammatory weekend broadcast by Mr Jonas Savimbi, the Unita
leader, which claimed the elections had been rigged, dismissed the verdict
of the international community and made a veiled threat of a return to
violence.
Mr Herman Cohen, US assistant secretary for African affairs, and South
African President FW de Klerk both sent messages to Unita, once backed by
Washington and Pretoria, urging restraint and respect for established
procedures for resolving disputes.
'Savimbi is having trouble facing up the reality that Unita has been a
victim of its own propaganda for the past 17 years and it does not have the
support in the country it thought it had,' said a senior western diplomat
yesterday. 'It a very painful process for Savimbi personally, and he is
obviously confused, emotional and frustrated. But we are telling him in no
uncertain terms that he must stay with the process.'
Official results from 70 per cent of the country's 5,616 polling stations
showed yesterday that President dos Santos was leading Mr Savimbi in the
presidential race by 53.6 to 37 per cent.
In the legislative elections the MPLA was ahead by 57.3 per cent to Unita's
31.5 per cent. More than 3m votes had been counted last night out of a total
registered electorate of 4.86m, suggesting a turnout of 85-90 per cent.
Although hundreds of results were still awaited from the Unita rural
strongholds of Huambo, Cuando Cubango and Bie provinces, where Mr Savimbi
was leading Mr dos Santos by at least 3 to 1, it was clear last night that
Mr Dos Santos's lead could not be eroded - although a second round between
the two arch-rivals was still a possibility if neither received more than 50
per cent.
As Unita's defeat became certain, Mr Savimbi said the country was facing 'a
grave hour' and he alleged the MPLA was cheating, stealing ballot boxes,
deviating votes and inflating numbers.
He warned: 'If the MPLA wants to opt for war, it knows that such a war will
never be won.' He also said that if the National Electoral Commission did
not address his allegations it would 'lead Unita to take a position which
will deeply disturb the situation in this country'.
He added: 'There are men and women in this country who are ready to give up
their lives so that the country can redeem itself.'
Yesterday morning Unita presented a dossier of what they termed 'fraudulent
incidents' to the NEC, the most serious of which concerned the removal of 20
ballot boxes from polling stations in Malange province during the first
night of the two-day election.
Western diplomats said irregularities in the elections were always
considered inevitable in a country with no tradition of democracy and an
infrastructure lying in ruins. But they stressed that isolated incidents of
irregularities would not be sufficient to cast doubt over the entire
electoral process, and that the overwhelming verdict of international
observers had been that the voting and counting was generally free and fair.
Mr Onofre dos Santos, NEC director general, said yesterday he was taking the
Unita allegations very seriously and had begun investigations.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Victoria election blow to Keating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE re-election prospects of Australia's federal Labor government dimmed
yesterday after the opposition conservative parties scored a landslide
victory in state elections in Victoria.
The Liberal/National party coalition achieved a bigger than expected swing
to eject Labor from government in Australia's second most populous state for
the first time in 10 years.
Counting was still continuing last night, but it appeared that Labor would
win less than a quarter of Victoria's 88 state parliament seats. The defeat
will be a severe blow to Mr Paul Keating's federal government, which needs
to retain several marginal seats in Victoria to win the next national
election, due by next June.
Labor's federal prospects have also been weakened by a defeat in Tasmania
earlier this year, and by its failure to dislodge a minority conservative
government in New South Wales. Labor governments in South Australia and
Western Australia have also been forced to accept independent support to
survive, and both are expected lose state elections next year.
Mr Keating played down the Victorian result, claiming it was due largely to
local factors which would be forgotten in the federal election. The
Victorian Labor government lost significant support as a result of high
unemployment and tax increases following heavy losses by state-owned
financial institutions.
Mr Keating's main hope of rebuilding support in Victoria lies in a
confrontation between the conservatives and the trade union movement, which
has threatened to oppose proposals for industrial relations reform. Any
signs of industrial unrest in Victoria are likely to be portrayed by Labor
as a foretaste of what would happen under a conservative government in
Canberra.

FT  05 OCT 92 / What is left of the British 'economic miracle'?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the midst of the current recession, all that talk of four years ago about
a 'British economic miracle' seems a delusion, one triggered by a powerful
economic drug, easy credit. But a recent survey, published by the Treasury,
suggests that neither the euphoria of a few years ago nor the despair of
today is entirely justified.* The 1980s did see creditable achievements, but
ones that were in part thrown away.
The years 1979 and 1989 were the peaks of two successive cycles. Between
those years, UK gross domestic product grew at 2.2 per cent a year, less
than between 1960 and 1973, when growth was 3.2 per cent, but more than the
1.5 per cent achieved between 1973 and 1979. UK growth in the 1980s was
marginally more than in the EC as a whole, though less than in the US, which
managed 2.8 per cent, and in Japan, which achieved 4 per cent.
Productivity growth in the whole economy shows a similar picture. The UK's
1.8 per cent growth of labour productivity between 1979 and 1989 was up with
European levels and ahead of the US, which achieved a mere 1.1 per cent a
year, but behind Japan's 2.9 per cent. Again, what was remarkable was the
deterioration of others; Japan's annual rate of productivity growth had been
8.1 per cent between 1960 and 1973 and Italy's 5.8 per cent.
Not to fall further behind was an achievement of a kind, but no cause for
ecstasy, but in manufacturing, where labour productivity was (and is) still
further behind levels achieved in more successful economies than elsewhere
in the British economy, the UK started to catch up, as shown in the top
chart.
Labour productivity in manufacturing rose 4.8 per cent a year between 1979
and 1989. This was not only vastly better than the 1.1 per cent registered
between 1973 and 1979, but also better than the 3.4 per cent of 1960-73. UK
performance was behind that of Japan, which managed 5.4 per cent, but well
above Germany's 1.8 per cent (no Wirtschaftswunder here), France's 3.2 per
cent and Italy's 4 per cent.
What caused the improvement? Not investment, it appears, nor closure of
inefficient capacity. What mattered most was greater flexibility and
efficiency in companies. Just how much that can mean is shown in the second
chart. Notice in particular how the overmanned and slothful public
enterprise behemoths, most now privatised, increased labour productivity by
70 per cent between 1979-80 and 1988-89.
UK manufacturing did become fitter, but output rose by only 12.3 per cent,
from peak to cyclical peak. Yet one would expect a sector enjoying a global
market and achieving a high rate of growth of productivity to grow quickly,
absorbing a high proportion of investment in the process. UK manufacturing
did not. From 27 per cent of business investment in 1979, its share declined
to 19 per cent in 1989.
Presumably, manufacturing did not grow more because it was not profitable
enough. Profitability was ground between the nether millstone of rapid rises
in real wages, averaging 2.7 per cent a year between 1979 and 1989, and the
upper millstone of international competition. Lower growth in the real cost
of labour would have raised the return on capital and stimulated more - and
more - labour-absorbing investment, both of which were needed in a high
unemployment economy.
In the 1990s, productivity growth needs to flow more strongly into profits,
which still appear low by international standards. Remarkably, in view of
the recession, labour productivity in manufacturing rose 5 per cent between
the third quarter of 1990 and last July, but the rise in real earnings,
still more than 2 per cent a year, has eroded much of the benefit for
profitability.
Similarly, there will be no contribution to competitiveness from last
month's depreciation of sterling if it is offset by another wave of wage
inflation. Productivity growth is excellent, but higher growth of output
depends on the course of wages and profits as well.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S troop deployment in Cambodia speeded up at the weekend with 160 more
soldiers joining the peace mission. This is the first overseas task for
Japanese ground forces since Japan's surrender in 1945 and follows the
signing into law of its peace-keeping operations bill in June after 20
months' bitter debate. The engineer units and eight military observers join
15,000 soldiers from 30 countries wearing UN blue berets in Cambodia. They
will monitor a ceasefire, disarm rival armies and supervise elections next
May. The main body of Japanese troops arrives on October 13.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Police seek to bottle up Osaka riots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   OSAKA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of riot police patrolled slum streets in Osaka last night after
four days of violent clashes with destitute labourers left several dozen
people injured and the area strewn with debris and gutted vehicles.
Twelve arrests were made as many of the Airin area's 30,000 day-labourers
protested against the suspension of welfare payments by the local
government. But the real cause is Japan's economic downturn, which has hit
labourers harder than mainstream workers.
At around 5am each morning, the day-labour market opens in the dirty
concrete building which has been at the centre of the protests. Job touts
with presumed gang links hold up notices offering two or three days' work
clearing a building site or filling a job-spot in a small factory.
The crash of Osaka's property market and the slowing of factory orders have
left many of the men reliant on handouts.
A special fund was exhausted last week, inspiring the protests by the
destitute, whose desperation is heightened by drink dependence or debts to
gang-run loan shops. Last night, hundreds of the workers were sleeping
outside the job market, where they were hoping to get work in the day's
muster.
Placards around the building demanded government help. Small groups of
workers huddled together, discussing tactics. Meanwhile, hundreds of riot
police with shields and batons at the ready massed in a nearby police
station. The clashes are the most serious since a week of rioting in the
same district two years ago left 200 injured.
Police fear the riots will be a feature of the economic downturn, as the
labourers' desperation becomes more acute, and that the troubles may be a
beacon for extremist right-wing groups. One factor fuelling the protests is
outrage at a police confession that a local officer had taken bribes from
gangsters.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S political leadership is under increasing pressure to respond to
public criticism of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the Liberal Democratic party's most
powerful faction chief, who last week was fined Y200,000 (Pounds 934) for
receiving illegal political donations of Y500m (Pounds 2.33m).
Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, who has depended heavily on Mr Kanemaru's
behind-the-scenes support, said he deeply regretted his colleague had
breached the political control funds law. Mr Kanemaru was fined after he
admitted receiving money from a scandal-ridden courier company. Mr
Miyazawa's first comments, ,at a weekend seminar of LDP members, were widely
seen as an attempt to respond to party criticism. Mr Miyazawa said he would
devote himself to making detailed political reform proposals to the Diet in
November.
The LDP leadership has come under pressure for further action and the
controversy could trigger a destabilising power struggle within the LDP over
the successor to Mr Kanemaru as head of the Takeshita faction, the largest
within the LDP.
The opposition parties have unanimously called for Mr Kanemaru to testify to
the Diet over the case and some have called for his resignation. Also, more
than 70 prefectural and city assemblies have passed resolutions criticising
Mr Kanemaru or the Tokyo prosecutors for failing to pursue the case to
court.
It is thought Mr Kanemaru made a written confession to avoid a trial which
could have further damaged his standing and risked the exposure of
allegations that he has had links with Japan's leading crime syndicate. Mr
Miyazawa's handling of the issue has been perceived as weak, reflecting his
dependence on Mr Kanemaru. This was underlined by an expression of thanks to
Mr Kanemaru for his promotion of party unity.

<DATELINE>
   PRAGUE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER Czechoslovak president, Mr Vaclav Havel, urged at the weekend
that preparations towards an independent Czech state be speeded up,
following a Slovak about-face which dashed plans to dissolve the federal
state by the end of the year.
Mr Havel was reacting to the initiative of Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak
prime minister, who with the Czech opposition parties succeeded on Thursday
in having the federal parliament adopt a motion to draw up plans for a new
union between the Czech and Slovak republics.
This union would link the two republics under a single president heading a
government in charge of economic, defence, foreign, social and environmental
policies.
The move contradicts all post-electoral agreements between Mr Meciar and Mr
Vaclav Klaus, the Czech prime minister, which aimed to dissolve the federal
state legally by January 1.
'I fear this will lead to prolonged uncertainty,' Mr Havel said. 'The Czech
parliament should declare its intention to create an independent Czech state
and adopt as soon as possible its own constitution.'
Calls for a unilateral secession of the Czech republic from the federal
state increased at the weekend among Czech officials angered by the Slovak
U-turn. However, such a move could only legally be achieved via a popular
referendum. Recent opinion polls show that fewer than half of all Czechs
would vote to break up the federal state.
Mr Klaus, who had pushed for a break-up since Slovak nationalists won power
in last June's election, is due to meet Mr Meciar tomorrow.

<TEXT>
MR Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet president and Communist party
leader, has cancelled a scheduled trip to South Korea after the
Constitutional Court banned him from leaving Russia.
Mr Gorbachev faces legal action, including possible imprisonment, if he
continues to refuse to testify before the court, which is determining
whether or not the party he led was 'constitutional'. Mr Gorbachev said on
Saturday that he had become the first Russian political 'refusenik',
claiming that the the court's demand for him to testify was itself
anti-constitutional.
'From a political standpoint,' Mr Gorbachev said, 'such an action is
administrative lawlessness, fraught with the revival of the practice of
deprivation of rights for political motives (a reference to the Stalin
era).'
The court has heard testimony from a number of former top Communists,
including Mr Nikolai Ryzhkov, prime minister during most of Mr Gorbachev's
leadership, and Mr Arkady Volsky, a former senior aide to several party
leaders and one of the few such officials to have kept a top job, as head of
the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Moves to scrap Soviet debt plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE and Russia announced plans at the weekend to scrap the system of
collective responsibility for the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union.
But the two Slavic heavyweights advanced conflicting proposals for a new
system.
At a meeting in Kiev, Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president, and Mr
Yegor Gaidar, Russia's acting prime minister, agreed that the system, which
the former Soviet republic established under intense pressure from western
creditors, was flawed.
Under the fierce scrutiny of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised
countries, eight of the former Soviet republics, including Russia and
Ukraine, assumed at the end of last year 'joint and several' responsibility
for the former Soviet Union's Dollars 82bn (Pounds 46bn) foreign debt.
Western creditors, fearing some of the poorer republics might default,
pushed for collective assumption of the debt over the objections of
independent-minded republics like Ukraine.
The agreement on collective responsibility for the debt could be severely
strained by the joint attack from Ukraine and Russia, which have together
pledged to pay back 77.47 per cent of the total.
'We have agreed that the old system of joint and several responsibility for
the foreign debt of the former Soviet Union is going nowhere and does not
work,' Mr Gaidar said.
However, Ukraine and Russia differed on alternatives. Ukrainian negotiators
said that Russia proposed a 'zero option' to Ukraine. The idea was that
Russia should assume sole responsibility for the debt with regard to western
creditors and, in exchange, be granted exclusive control over the former
Soviet Union's foreign assets.
According to this proposal, Ukraine's share of 16.37 per cent of the debt
would become Ukrainian debt to Russia. As Kiev paid off the money to Moscow,
it would receive a corresponding share of the assets.
Ukrainian officials objected on the grounds that it would give de jure
status to Russia's de facto control over the former Soviet Union's foreign
assets. Obtaining a share of these assets has been a central plank of
Ukrainian foreign policy for the past year.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Moscow warns Georgia over arms: 'Armed clash' if weapons
seized from Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN defence minister, General Pavel Grachev, has warned the
government of Georgia not to fulfil its stated intention to take over all
weapons and military equipment of the Russian (formerly Soviet) forces on
its territory, or risk 'an armed clash with Russian forces'.
This follows a warning on Saturday from Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
'take corresponding measures to protect the interests of Russian citizens'
caught up in the growing conflict in Georgia.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, had ordered the seizure of
Russian arms at the weekend after touring the area of fighting in the
northern Georgian autonomous republic of Abkhazia, where local forces took
the town of Gagra after heavy fighting last week. Mr Shevardnadze said he
would raise an army of 40,000 reservists against the Abkhazian rebels, who
engaged the Georgian forces sent to the republic after it declared
independence in August.
The conflict is spreading throughout the Caucasus, as the Confederation of
Mountain Peoples also vowed to raise a 40,000-strong force to assist
Abkhazia in its struggle. The confederation draws its support from the
largely Moslem Caucasian autonomous republics on Russia' s southern border
with Georgia.
Russian troops are also being drawn into the ever-fiercer civil war in the
Central Asian state of Tajikistan, where supporters of ousted President
Rakhmon Nabiyev have concentrated in the south of the republic and are
battling with supporters of the new, pro-Islamic government of the republic
in the regional capital of Kurgan-Tyube.
Reports from the area yesterday pointed to continuing fierce fighting, with
refugees streaming out of Kurgan-Tyube towards the Tajik capital of
Dushanbe. The Russian detachments in the republic were strengthened last
week, and are accused by the anti-Nabiyev forces of supporting the former
Communist leader.
Appeals for ceasefires in the regions and for the deployment of
peace-keeping forces drawn from the members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (of which Russia and Tajikistan are members, but Georgia
is not) have had no effect. A meeting of CIS foreign ministers is scheduled
in Moscow today to prepare for the Friday meeting of CIS heads of state,
postponed from September 25.
Pakistan warned its nationals against travelling in Tajikistan, following
the killing of a Pakistani businessman and threats against others in
Dushanbe this month. Pakistanis have been active in trade in the republic
over the past year.
The Abkhazian defence headquarters has guaranteed safe conduct out of the
republic for those Georgian troops fighting within it, according to the
Interfax news agency last night. The agency said, however, that Georgian
forces were continuing to reinforce positions in the north of the area.

interrupts resumed Sarajevo airlift

THE FIRST group of Moslems released from Serb-held detention camps in
Bosnia-Hercegovina will be offered sanctuary in the west, mostly in
Scandinavia, the United Nations said in the Croatian capital Zagreb
yesterday.
In Sarajevo, the resumed aid airlift to the besieged city was interrupted by
bad weather. Four US and Canadian aircraft carrying food and radar equipment
needed to keep the airport functioning during winter landed yesterday in the
city before poor weather forced the suspension of the operation. Five other
scheduled flights were cancelled.
Mr Peter Kessler, spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in
Zagreb, said western countries had pledged to provide sanctuary for most of
the 1,600 mainly Moslem men released on Thursday from the Trnopolje camp in
northern Bosnia.
These, the most recent arrivals in neighbouring Croatia, which has some
700,000 refugees already, have been given shelter in abandoned army barracks
in Karlovac, southwest of Zagreb.
Croatian authorities have allowed the released detainees to remain in
Karlovac for two weeks.
Relief organisations at the run-down barracks worry however about visits by
Croatian and Bosnian army officers who, despite a ban, are trying to recruit
fighters.
Meanwhile, stories of cruelty by Serb forces against Moslems in Bosnia
continued to emerge. One man, allowed to speak by international relief
organisations on condition his identity was not revealed, yesterday
corroborated earlier reports of how Serb forces in August shot some 200
Moslem detainees in a ravine outside Travnik in southern Bosnia. He
explained how he had survived by lying for several hours under a dead body.
Other men considered themselves fortunate. Serb forces had released their
wives and children in July. Some were in Zagreb. But no one believed Moslems
would ever again be able to live with Serbs. They told how neighbours had
turned against neighbours.
Serb forces control about two-thirds of Bosnian territory. Some 2m people
have been displaced by the six-month war and at least 8,000 are believed to
be held in detention camps throughout the republic.
'They burnt down our houses. We were ordered to turn over all our
possessions. Money, watches, cars, whatever they could get,' said one man,
who, like many of the Moslem detainees, was from Kozarac.
'When we left the camp and drove through Kozarac, I did not recognise it,'
he said. 'The Serb forces moved the sign post to pretend it was another
place. It is like Vukovar (the devastated city in eastern Croatia which fell
to Serb forces last autumn).'
The UN Protection Force Headquarters in Zagreb yesterday protested to the
Croatian government and Ministry of Defence after two UN helicopters came
under fire while approaching Zagreb on Friday. The helicopters, on a medical
evacuation mission, landed safely at Zagreb airport. The incident followed a
similar attack last Monday.

FT  05 OCT 92 / El Al cargo jet hits Amsterdam

<TEXT>
SCORES OF people were feared killed last night after an El Al cargo aircraft
crashed into two nine-storey blocks of flats on the outskirts of the Dutch
city of Amsterdam.
Twelve bodies were recovered from the wrecked buildings but, with rescue
work continuing, firemen said there was virtually no chance of there being
any survivors in the 80 flats destroyed in the crash or gutted by flames. It
was not clear how many of the 239 people registered as living in the flats
were at home.
All four aboard the aircraft - three crew and one passenger - were believed
killed. At least 29 people were injured, some while leaping from the
high-rise buildings.
Although airline officials were careful not to commit themselves, early
indications suggested that mechanical failure led to the accident.
A spokesman for the Dutch civil aviation authority said the Israeli
airline's Boeing 747 appeared to have exploded on impact with the buildings
and there was no evidence so far that the aircraft had blown up in the air.
However, some eyewitnesses quoted by Dutch television reported seeing an
explosion before the crash.
The aircraft, which was en route from New York to Tel Aviv, had just
completed a stopover at Amsterdam's Schiphol airport. About 10 minutes after
take-off, the crew had reported flames shooting out from two of its four
engines and the aircraft was attempting to return to the airport when it
went down, hitting the two adjoining blocks, containing 480 flats.
The flats, located in the outlying Amsterdam neighbourhood of Bijlmermeer,
were constructed in the 1960s and house a mainly immigrant population.
Eyewitnesses said the aircraft appeared to have dumped fuel just before it
went down on its way back to Schiphol. The civil aviation authority said it
received a distress signal just before the crash. Officials said later that
two of the aircraft's four engines had fallen off and were recovered from a
lake 15km (9 miles) from the crash site.
An investigation into the incident - the worst civil aviation disaster in
the Netherlands - was launched immediately. In Israel, Mr Rafi Har Lev,
chief executive of El Al, said a team of Israeli investigators would leave
for Amsterdam to take part. Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister,
expressed his shock at the disaster.
Since the surge of hijackings by Arab and other international terrorist
groups in the 1970s, El Al has imposed probably the toughest security
measures of any airline in the world. It has suffered two mid-air hijackings
and several attacks on its aircraft and passengers on the ground in Israel
and elsewhere. But the airline has never lost an aircraft, cargo or
passenger to sabotage in mid-air.
On cargo flights freight is subject to strict controls which can result in
slower turnaround times than on rival airlines.

IN the worst prison violence in Brazilian history at least 111 inmates were
killed and 35 injured as police quelled an uprising inside the country's
largest prison.
The rebellion at the overcrowded Casa de Detencao in Sao Paulo was
apparently provoked by a clash between rival gangs. Inmates of Pavilion 9,
which houses the most dangerous criminals, began attacking each other on
Friday evening with clubs, knives and guns. They later barricaded themselves
in with furniture and set fire to the block.
After negotiations failed, 300 policemen stormed the jail and finally retook
it after four hours of fighting. Most of the deaths resulted from gunshot
wounds, according to officials who released the death toll on Saturday
evening. No police officer was killed.
Mr Luis Antonio Fleury, governor of Sao Paulo, ordered an inquiry into the
police action. Mr Mauricio Correa, the new justice minister, said the jail
system was in a state of collapse.
The political parties which led the successful campaign to impeach
ex-President Fernando Collor appear headed for victory in Brazil's municipal
elections. Preliminary results for Saturday's first-round elections in more
than 5,000 municipalities showed a significant shift to the left and a clear
rejection of pro-Collor candidates of the Liberal Front (PFL) and National
Reconstruction (PRN) parties.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Cable television bill to test Bush's veto powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush's veto power will today face its toughest test when
the Senate votes on a motion to override his refusal to sign legislation
regulating the cable television industry.
On all 35 previous Bush vetoes, including votes last week on trade with
China and abortion counselling, Congress has failed to muster the two-thirds
majority needed to override them.
The cable bill, however, won majorities well above the two-thirds mark on
its first passage in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Mr
Bush needs to persuade at least nine Republican senators to reverse their
earlier votes if he is to prevail.
Cable regulation has turned into a populist cause. Television broadcasters
and consumer interest groups have lobbied massively to fan the flames of
public hostility to the cable companies, which in many cities have used
their monopoly positions to raise fees by three times the rate of inflation.
The cable bill would empower the Federal Communications Commission to set
'reasonable' rates for basic cable services, although the few cable
operators who face competition in their districts would be exempt.
Mr Bush said in his veto message that it would result in higher, not lower
cable costs.
Differences of opinion on the bill do not always run along party lines,
although most supporters of the regulation effort are Democrats, and most
opponents Republicans.
Mr Bush yesterday called key Republican senators who voted in favour of the
bill a fortnight ago to breakfast at the White House, in the hope of
persuading them to switch their votes in the interests of party loyalty.
Perhaps assisting him in this effort is the active role of Senator Al Gore,
the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate, in pushing for the cable bill.
Mr Gore's vote for the bill on September 22 was only the third he has cast
in the Senate since Governor Bill Clinton picked him to be his running mate
in July.
Mr Gore's use of the cable issue on the presidential campaign trail could
help win over Republican waverers like Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah and
Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi.

FT  05 OCT 92 / The European Market: International groups wary of Swiss
tunnel project - Domestic companies' apparent advantages are deterring
foreign tenders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a tantalising clause in the Alpine transit treaty between
Switzerland and the European Community specifying that contracts exceeding
Ecu5m (Pounds 3.9m) in value for the massive SFr14.9bn (Pounds 6.7bn) Swiss
alpine tunnel project should be open to international tenders.
Since Swiss voters approved the project in a referendum last week, one might
expect the big European construction companies to be lining up for
applications.
Not so, according to Swiss analysts. The release of tenders is still a long
way off, and foreign companies are likely to have difficulty beating the
leading Swiss contractors anyway, as the Swiss have long experience of
tunnelling and much specialised equipment and personnel in place.
Also, as Credit Suisse hinted in a recent study, governments can usually
find ways to make sure domestic companies do well on big public projects,
even when international tenders are used. 'The application of Swiss laws on
wages, welfare payments and health and safety at work should prevent a major
share of the pie from disappearing down the throats of foreign companies,'
the study says.
According to the government's schedule, boring of the first 50km tunnel
through the Gotthard should get under way at the beginning of 1996. In the
meantime there are some large planning and design contracts to be let within
the next few months by the Swiss Federal Railways, the Gotthard project
manager.
Swiss analysts assume a consortium led by Elektrowatt, the Swiss energy and
engineering company, will win most of this work; the group designed the
Gotthard road tunnel built in the late 1970s. But Elektrowatt itself, even
though it has already participated in pre-design work, is less confident.
'It is completely open. We will compete hard, but there will be surprises,'
predicts Mr Max Bruggmann, director of Elektrowatt Engineering.
Similarly, for the 30km tunnel through the Lotschberg, the Swiss engineering
group Emch &amp; Berger seems well placed, having already done pre-design work
for Bern-Lotschberg-Simplon Bahn, the manager of that line.
When it comes to building tunnels, the leading Swiss construction groups,
Losinger, Stuag, Zschokke and Zublin, certainly have the experience.
The Swiss expect that some big European groups, such as Philipp Holzmann of
Germany and Cogefer and Lodiciani of Italy, will bid.
France's Lafarge Coppee, with its control of Cementia, is expected to
compete strongly with the Swiss Holderbank to supply construction materials,
but the highly specialised Swiss Sika Finanz group should win the contracts
for tunnel joints.
Swiss companies - led by ABB Asea Brown Boveri, Von Roll and Schindler  -
will also be strong competitors for the estimated SFr1.2bn in locomotive and
rolling stock orders, although foreign suppliers, including Siemens, figure
strongly in signalling equipment.
Nevertheless, in a project of this size there should be considerable smaller
sub-contracts for specialist manufacturers in other European countries. Mr
Michael Berger, of the Austrian Trade Commission in Zurich, says his office
is planning a symposium on the project for Austrian companies next spring.
Mr Serge Ledermann, of Geneva bankers Lombard Odier, says one consequence of
making the tendering international is that the fat margins Swiss contractors
normally get on their business will be squeezed. And the fact that the work
will be spread over 15 years means the impact on profits of any particular
company is not likely to be great.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US SENATOR John Kerry, who is investigating the failed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, stepped up his attacks on the Bank of England
yesterday with the claim that it 'is not telling the full story' about the
bank's collapse, writes David Lascelles.
Last week the Bank denied a charge in Mr Kerry's report that it had colluded
in a cover-up of BCCI's fraud with the claim that he had not taken evidence
directly from the Bank or its officials.
Mr Kerry said on the BBC yesterday he had approached the Federal Reserve
Board for documents which it had from the Bank of England. 'The Federal
Reserve informed us that under no conditions did the Bank of England want us
or anyone else to have access to those documents.'
Mr Kerry stood by his assertion that the Bank knew of BCCI's frauds in April
1990, more than a year before it was shut down.

FT  05 OCT 92 / Madrid considers interest rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE and ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN may be forced to raise its official interest rate from 13 per cent
this week to match demand for higher yields on the public debt it needs to
issue to raise by the end of the year about Dollars 17bn (Pounds 9.5bn) in
new deficit financing.
The Treasury failed to attract buyers at its auction of debt last week, and
both the government and the Bank of Spain appear disposed to use an interest
rate increase - possibly today - to offset a relaxation of a series of
unpopular capital controls it imposed nearly two weeks ago to stabilise the
peseta.
It is still possible that Madrid will wait to see whether the bond markets
continue to insist on higher yields, but Mr Carlos Solchaga, finance
minister, conceded in an interview on Friday that the need to finance
Spain's deficits could drive up official interest rates. 'We are prepared to
accept (an increase) if that is what the market dictates,' he said.
Foreign investors reacted to the imposition of exchange controls by staging
a massive exodus from the Spanish debt and equity markets. The general index
at the Madrid stock market ended last week at its lowest level in six years.
Both Mr Solchaga and Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insisted in interviews
last week that the controls were temporary. Other senior officials were
suggesting on Friday that they would be relaxed 'in a matter of days'.
Madrid, though, will not lift the controls completely. It would want any
rate rise to be seen as a response to bond market pressure and not an
attempt to defend the peseta. If the latter were the case, the Spanish
authorities fear being drawn into a speculative spiral similar to the one
which forced sterling out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism.
Nevertheless, it might use a 'technical' interest rate rise to test market
reaction, while holding a minimum of capital controls in reserve in case
downward pressure on the peseta continues.

FT  05 OCT 92 / President urges German solidarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Richard von Weizsacker of Germany warned this weekend that the
democratic structure of the country would be threatened by a failure to
revive the east German economy and to cope peacefully with an influx of
foreigners.
In a sweeping appeal for national solidarity and understanding, delivered on
the second anniversary of German unification, he called on west Germans to
forego any real increase in their incomes for the next five years to finance
the necessary transfers in spending to the east.
He also called for the full force of the law to be invoked against
right-wing extremists attacking asylum-seekers and other foreigners.
He spoke in Schwerin, capital of the eastern state of
Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, at unification celebrations marred by a rash of
demonstrations by both left-wing and right-wing extremists.
This coincided with scenes broadcast on television of Chancellor Helmut Kohl
being jostled by hostile crowds at the same event.
The president's speech amounted to both the most devastating and possibly
the most inspiring assessment of the challenges facing the united Germany to
be delivered since unification.
Germany was being criticised by its partners for concentrating exclusively
on the challenges of unification, and undermining their currencies by giving
priority to its domestic problems, he said. Yet if the country failed to
forge a real national unity it would become an international burden.
'We can endanger our entire democratic structure if we fail to put our own
house in order,' the president warned.
He said the level of unemployment in the east could not be allowed to drag
on for five years or more. At the same time west Germans could not expect
any real increase in their incomes, above the rate of inflation, for at
least five years; nor was there any realistic prospect of living standards
equalising in that time.
As for the rash of violence against foreigners, he said: 'The touchstone of
our democratic order is our behaviour towards the influx from abroad. We
cannot hope to dry up that flow. We can only attempt to channel it and,
step-by-step, to reduce it.'
Yesterday Mr Rudolf Seiters, the interior minister, promised new measures
against the right-wing extremists, including preventive detention and wider
powers of police arrest.
The failure to stem the rash of disturbances since summer appears finally to
have galvanised Mr Kohl into action.
The Chancellor used his strongest words to date in a message yesterday to a
rally at Sachsenhausen, the former Nazi concentration camp where a Jewish
museum was destroyed in an arson attack last week.
'There must be no tolerance of intolerance,' he declared. 'The law-based
state must not be prevented, by some ill-understood idea of liberalism, from
showing its teeth to terrorists, whichever side they are on.'

FT  05 OCT 92 / Pressure builds on Craxi as son leaves politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Vittorio 'Bobo' Craxi, the son of Italy's Socialist party leader, Mr
Bettino Craxi, is withdrawing from politics after a series of allegations
and setbacks in the wake of the Milan political corruption scandal.
The younger Mr Craxi, a leading member of the Socialist party organisation
in Italy's second city, seemed set until recently to follow in his father's
footsteps, possibly to the top of the party developed by his father into a
linchpin of recent coalition governments.
Pressure is also building up on Mr Craxi senior to step down as party
leader.
Last week he attacked Mr Claudio Martelli, the justice minister and his
heir-apparent, for 'disloyalty' for his increasing calls for change in the
party.
The Socialists, and the Craxis in particular, have been tainted by the
growing revelations of political corruption in big Italian cities.
Milan has been a traditional Socialist stronghold and remains the powerbase
for the Craxi family. Mr Bettino Craxi's sister is married to Mr Paolo
Pillitteri, the previous Socialist mayor of Milan, who is one of a group of
MPs now under investigation for alleged fraud and receiving kickbacks.
Though no charges have been brought against Mr 'Bobo' Craxi, he has
complained of being regularly insulted by strangers and of being taken for
guilty when actually innocent.
Revelations of political corruption have been mushrooming following the
discovery last week of a fraud in the Abruzzo region in southern Italy
leading to the arrest of seven of the 11 members of the regional
administration.
Meanwhile, the Christian Democrats, Italy's biggest political party, named
Mr Mino Martinazzoli as their next leader to replace Mr Arnaldo Forlani.
Mr Forlani was one of the triumvirate of powerbrokers along with Mr Craxi
and Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former prime minister, in the previous
coalition government.
Mr Martinazzoli will be formally appointed at the party's next congress, due
later this month.
Senior party members welcomed his appointment as a symbol of the change
needed for the party to regain electoral support. In local elections in the
northern province of Mantua last week, the Christian Democrats' share of the
vote dropped by over a third.
The Christian Democrats lost ground in northern Italy in last April's
general elections.

groundwork for emergency summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN foreign ministers will today seek to restore a climate of trust
among member states shaken by the Anglo-German rift and turmoil in the money
markets.
During two days of talks in Luxembourg, the Twelve will lay the groundwork
for the emergency EC summit in Birmingham on October 16. The goal is to
reinforce an emerging consensus on early ratification of the Maastricht
treaty, to dispel uncertainty about the community's future.
A prime topic on the agenda will be subsidiarity - the code-word for
devolving decision-making to member states at national and regional level.
Larger states, led by Britain, France and Germany, are at loggerheads with
the smaller nations who want to prevent attacks on the powers of the
European Commission, their traditional protector.
The Council of Ministers will also deal with pressing trade issues,
including prospects for progress on the Gatt multilateral trade talks ahead
of meetings with US negotiators scheduled for next weekend.
EC ministers hope to show the rest of the world that the Community has not
been paralysed by the political and economic divisions which have surfaced
in the wake of last month's lukewarm endorsement of the Maastricht treaty in
a French referendum.
The British government, too, is under pressure to deliver results as
chairman of the rotating EC presidency. Some member states have been
dismayed by divisions on Europe within the ruling Conservative party, while
others have expressed private frustration with the high-handedness of some
British ministers.
Prime Minster John Major's pledge to seek early ratification of the
Maastricht treaty in parliament has reassured Brussels, but questions remain
about the UK's policy on Europe following its decision last month to
withdraw from the Exchange Rate Mechanism for an indefinite period.
Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary who will chair today's talks, will lead
discussions on the Delors II proposals for the 1993-97 EC budget, including
'cohesion' funds for poorer EC member states. An agreement on this funding
is required before formal talks on enlargement can begin with Austria,
Finland and Sweden.
A lunch with the foreign ministers of Poland, the Czech Federation, Slovakia
and Hungary should produce a declaration on closer ties. But it will fall
short of offering the timetable for EC accession which the countries would
like.
Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy said yesterday that French interest rates
would be lowered 'now that the franc has been recognised (by the foreign
exchange markets) as a solid currency, based on a sound economy', Reuter
reports from Paris.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, yesterday
endorsed the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) but said it must be
toughened up in US legislation, which is needed to implement the pact.
After several days of debate within his campaign, the governor took a middle
course. Instead of urging renegotiation over workers' rights and
environmental provisions, as his labour allies have urged, Mr Clinton said
he believed the pact could be strengthened unilaterally.
He said the treaty should not be seen as a solution to America's economic
problems or a threat to its future. It could mean more jobs for American
workers and better environmental protection.
'I am convinced I can do it right,' he said. 'I am deeply convinced that
(President George) Bush won't'
His decision not to seek renegotiation will limit the scope of changes to
provisions like job retraining. Mr Bush has offered a Dollars 2bn-a-year
(Pounds 1.1bn) retraining scheme but has not identified the means to fund
it. However, the president made a point of accusing his opponent of
'waffling' even before the agreement's text was publicly available.
Clinton advisers are understood to have felt it was important to get the
Nafta issue out of the way before Wednesday, when Mr Bush is due to sign the
pact in San Antonio, Texas. Above all, Mr Clinton's position had to be clear
before the three 90-minute debates he is to hold with Mr Bush and Mr Ross
Perot on October 11, 15 and 19.

FT  05 OCT 92 / People: Scotland's latest press baron
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scotland has a new newspaper tycoon. Ian Macpherson, who takes over the
chairmanship of Caledonian Newspaper Publishing this week, will head a
company which publishes The Herald, Scotland's leading quality daily, and
the Glasgow Evening Times, the UK's fifth largest evening paper.
The 56-year-old Macpherson, an accountant by training, is keen to play down
the idea that he will behave like a traditional newspaper proprietor. He
describes himself as a professional chairman and points out that since he
lives in St Andrews, 100 miles from Caledonian's Glasgow HQ, he will not be
continually popping in to host lunches and interfere in editorial
management.
Caledonian, a Pounds 74m management buy-out from Lonrho in May, has been
looking for a new chairman to take over from the veteran journalist Kenneth
Harris.
Liam Kane, Caledonia's chief executive, says that Caledonian's backers,
which include several well known Scottish financial institutions, were
looking for a 'financial exit' over the next three to five years and wanted
a chairman with good City connections.
Being a Scotsman clearly helped, but Macpherson describes himself as more a
'cousin' of Scotland's so-called 'financial mafia' than a fully-fledged
'brother'. He has spent a large part of his career south of the border after
qualifying with Peat Marwick and Dundee's Alliance Trust. He was a partner
of W Greenwell, the London stockbrokers, and opened Manufacturers Hanover
Trust's Scottish operation.
In 1979, he joined the British Linen Bank and rose to be deputy chief
executive. He is currently chairman and chief executive of Watson &amp; Philip,
Britain's third largest food distributor, and non-executive chairman of Low
&amp; Bonar, a packaging and paper group. He also sits on the board of the
London Stock Exchange.
Macpherson sees his role at Caledonian as making sure that it meets its
financial targets. However, the combination of the financial constraints of
the MBO and the recession are bound to result in 'stressful conditions' and
Macpherson sees an important part of his task as being a 'great encourager
of people'.
Meanwhile, at the other end of the country, the fifth generation of a
provincial newspaper dynasty has started to appear. Kenelm Storey, 29, has
been appointed a non-executive director of Portsmouth and Sunderland
Newspapers which is headed by his father Sir Richard Storey. Kenelm, who is
general manager of The Guardian International, is the fifth generation of
the family to be involved in the business which was started by Samuel Storey
in 1873. Like his father, who joined the board at the age of 25, Kenelm is a
Wykehamist.
*****
The top guard at Low &amp; Bonar is changing. Walter Telfer, 56, a former deputy
group chief executive and currently head of international operations, is
retiring at the end of December to pursue other personal and business
interests. He joined Low &amp; Bonar in 1975 and for the past two years has been
chairman of its North American packaging and plastics operations. His
departure will coincide with the retirement of Roland Jarvis, 59, chief
executive for the past eight years. Jim Leng, 46, chief executive of
European operations, will take over from Jarvis as group chief executive on
December 1.
*****
Richard Stillwell, golf fanatic and chief executive of Imperial Chemical
Industries' paints operations in the Asia Pacific, is forsaking the delights
of Singapore's luscious golf courses for the watering holes of Brussels. He
is moving to Belgium as managing director of ICI's polyurethanes business,
part of ICI materials division.
The move follows Robb Margetts elevation to the main board of ICI from his
position as chief executive of the Tioxide group. Stillwell's predecessor at
polyurethanes, Alan Pedder, is promoted to Margetts' job. He is swapping
Brussels for Hammersmith, a less than exotic part of west London.
*****
David Carter, 40, general manager finance of ICI Specialties, has joined
ICI's eight-year-old corporate acquisitions team headed by 49-year-old John
Dewhurst.
Carter, who has worked on the financial side of ICI since joining in 1979,
is the fifth member of a small team which was set up by Sir Denys Henderson,
ICI's current chairman. Whereas many big companies use outside merchant
banks to vet potential acquisitions, ICI is of such a size that it can
justify its own in-house team.
The team advises the ICI board on acquisitions, mergers and divestments,
particularly on aspects such as scale, resources, merits and priorities.
Since it was established, the unit has examined over 2,000 companies and
been involved in 300 transactions.
Probably the best known of the executives who have passed through the ICI
acquisitions team is David Nash, Grand Metropolitan's current finance
director. After 12 years with ICI, Nash was appointed group finance director
of Cadbury Schweppes in 1987 before joining GrandMet in December 1989.

The bonds have a 15-year life and carry a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent - 1 1/2

STET, the telecommunications group controlled by IRI, the Italian state
holding company, yesterday announced it was buying IRI's 83.3 per cent stake
in Finsiel, the data processing group, for L700bn (Dollars 565.4m).
The deal has been under consideration for some time and represents a major
rationalisation of Italy's telecommunications and software industry.
The move has been prompted by developments in the European
telecommunications industry with telephone companies spreading into the fast
expanding services sector.
STET officials cited the recent case of France Telecom taking a stake in Cap
Gemini. STET derives 74 per cent of its income from telecommunications
services, 17 per cent from manufacturing and installation companies and 9
per cent from publishing and diversified activities
It controls Italy's state owned telecommunications activities, notably SIP,
the main operating utility and last year returned net profits of L1,413bn on
sales of L22,946bn. Finsiel is the financial holding company co-ordinating
IRI's software activities and turned in a net profit of L29.4bn on sales of
L1,283bn.
Last year Olivetti sought to carry out a reverse takeover of Finsiel but was
turned down. Olivetti's overtures then accelerated the STET takeover.
IRI is reducing its stake in STET to around 53 per cent of the ordinary
shares and 1 per cent of savings stock.
A definitive price tag for the deal will be fixed by November 30. Yesterday
it was not clear what would happen to the remaining 16.7 per cent of Finsiel
held by the Bank of Italy.

FT  03 OCT 92 / The Lex Column: NFC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's Pounds 82.5m convertible bond issue by NFC was a rare event
indeed. Such issues have been scarce since the Accounting Standards Board
decided that convertible liabilities should not be dressed up as equity. The
problem is one of constrained supply rather than limited demand. Sterling's
weakness may discourage overseas buyers. But with interest rates expected to
fall and some uncertainty over the trend in corporate earnings, the
combination of a 7 3/4 per cent fixed income and an option on equity looks,
arguably, more tempting than ever.
Without the accounting advantages, though, convertibles have less appeal to
many issuing companies. To protect their pre-emption rights, UK institutions
have set an effective limit of 5 per cent of equity capital for convertible
issues. Only companies of the stature of Hanson can raise really large
amounts. Share prices may also have to show a more sustained rally before
many companies are tempted to consider rights issues or any other
equity-linked finance.
NFC is, perhaps, a special case. Its shares have outperformed throughout the
recession. Yet the high proportion of employees on the share register rules
out a rights issue. The cash will be used to repay bank debt, but looking
ahead will doubtless fund a continuing steady expansion. The 6 per cent fall
in the shares yesterday simply reflects switching from the cash stock to the
convertible. It can thus be dismissed as simply technical.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Top staff sacked at Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY Wharf's chief executive and 33 of its senior staff were made
redundant yesterday, four months after the east London office project went
into administration.
The redundancies, which are seen as a cost-cutting exercise, have come
during a critical period for the Docklands scheme. They follow last week's
break-down of bid talks with a consortium which was likely to retain the
project's senior management.
They also follow an offer this week by the project's bankers to contribute
Pounds 395m over 25 years to the costs of the Jubilee Line underground
extension. The administrators expect the government to take several weeks to
reach a decision on the extension, which will be crucial to the future of
the project.
The redundant chief executive, Mr Michael Dennis, who masterminded the
construction of the 4.5m sq ft office complex, yesterday underlined his
backing for Canary Wharf: 'Even after it went into administration a number
of us stayed on because of our attachment to the project.
'We remain hopeful that the government will accept the administrators' offer
(of a contribution towards the Jubilee Line extension), build the Jubilee
Line and help make a success of Canary Wharf,' he said.
Mr Stephen Adamson, a partner of Ernst &amp; Young who is a joint administrator,
said: 'The redundancies are regrettable but we have retained the essential
strengths of the O&amp;Y team to enable us to progress successfully with our
strategy.'
The redundancies are expected to cut Pounds 2.5m from O&amp;Y's annual payroll
of Pounds 6m. Administration costs are thought to be running at Pounds 1m a
month, half of which are the administrators' fees.
Three directors, Mr Robert John, a former director of County NatWest, Mr
Peter Dale and Mr Charles Young, were also made redundant. The other
redundancies included heads of departments and senior legal staff.
A total of 281 staff remain at Olympia &amp; York Canary Wharf including
directors Mr Robert Spiers and Mr Gerald Rothman. The administrators said
that the 200-strong estate management team would remain intact.
The administrators said that talks with potential bidders would resume on a
positive decision on the Jubilee Line by the government.

FT  03 OCT 92 / EC states urged to pool foreign reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community member states should consider pooling their foreign
exchange reserves as part of an urgent package of measures to save the
European Monetary System, Mr Carlos Solchaga, Spain's economy minister, said
yesterday.
Mr Solchaga said: 'The system is almost absolutely broken. Interest rates
are so high that they cannot last for long without creating real problems
for economic recovery.'
The search for agreement needed to begin before the EC summit in Birmingham
on October 16, he said, despite the problems created by increasing political
and personal rancour between EC governments.
He outlined three steps to restore market confidence in the exchange rate
mechanism:
A review of the credibility of the existing currency grid. He said he was
not formally calling for another realignment of ERM parities but informal
discussions should take place in the next few days about the wisdom of such
a move.
The creation of a 'multilateral European fund of reserves', a pooling of
central bank reserves, to be administered jointly to defend currency
parities within the ERM. This, he said, could ease pressure on the
Bundesbank, whose recent interventions in support of other currencies has
inflated the German money supply. Spain has the second highest currency
reserves in Europe after the Bundesbank. A general agreement to reduce
interest rates across the EC.
Mr Solchaga's suggestions will not be welcomed by all his EC colleagues,
many of whom are struggling to keep the structure and management of the EMS
off the summit agenda. But they reflect Spain's deep anxiety to restore
confidence in its own economic management after the 5 per cent devaluation
of the peseta two weeks ago and its decision to reintroduce capital controls
temporarily.
Spain is worried that without at least an informal agreement to consider
changes in the ERM within days, the currency market turbulence will
intensify in the run-up to the Birmingham meeting, with the weaker
currencies coming under further speculative attack.
'In the absence of a global solution, everyone will look for individual
solutions,' he said. 'But there are no individual solutions if there is not
global credibility.' While recognising that German rates could not be cut in
current circumstances, he said this would be possible in the event of a
general realignment.
'We have done a lot of damage to the European Monetary System in the last
few weeks and without it it will be impossible to proceed to the second
phase (in January 1994) of monetary union,' he said.
Mr Solchaga expressed surprise and irritation at recent reported comments by
the German finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, suggesting that a group of
'hard core' EC currencies could move quickly towards fixing their parities.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Sarajevo airlift resumes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER, ROBERT MAUTHNER and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZAGREB, LONDON, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE United Nations will today resume the humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo,
suspended exactly a month ago after an Italian relief aircraft was shot
down.
The resumption of the airlift comes amid mounting international concern for
the fate of hundreds of thousands of people in Bosnia who may not survive
the winter.
Two US aircraft are due to fly food and medical supplies to Sarajevo from
Germany. They will return to Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and fly in more
humanitarian aid from there to some 380,000 people trapped in the Bosnian
capital, said Mr Michael Keats, a spokesman for Zagreb office of the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), yesterday.
France has also announced it will rejoin the international airlift, sending
two aircraft to Sarajevo from Split, the Croatian port city. UNHCR officials
said the combined effort could bring as much as 60 tonnes to the battered
city besieged for nearly six months by Serb forces.
The mission will be the first since September 3, when aid flights were
suspended after an Italian aircraft was shot down south-west of Sarajevo
over mountains controlled by Croat and Moslem forces.
Both Britain and Germany said that they would not participate in the resumed
humanitarian airlift for the moment.
A Ministry of Defence official in London said that the safety of British
aircrews was involved and that it was up to Britain to take its own decision
on whether to participate in the flights. Such a decision would be taken on
the basis of information on the risks of the operation given by British
military personnel in Bosnia and after talks with other nations involved in
the airlift.
In Bonn, a German Ministry of Defence official said Germany was unlikely to
restart its humanitarian airlift to Sarajevo until mid-October. 'We are
still in the process of fitting electronic (weapon detection) devices into
our aircraft,' he said.
George Graham adds from Washington: President Bush announced last night that
the US would accept a 'no fly' zone in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Pentagon
however remains very reluctant to do much to enforce it.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US acting secretary of state, acknowledged
earlier in the week that there was a split within the administration over
the question.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Nearly 60 hurt in violence at Italian union protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 60 people were hurt yesterday, including 23 police, when a protest
demonstration by Italy's three main trade union confederations against the
Amato government's economic policy degenerated into violence.
The violence was provoked by a small group of militant trade unionists and
their supporters who sought to break up an open-air meeting at the end of a
march through the streets of Rome. Police used tear gas to disperse the
crowd and prevent scuffles between the marchers and those trying to disrupt
the meeting.
The violence appears part of a pattern that has emerged since the unions
initiated a series of regional four-hour general strikes on September 22 to
protest at proposed cuts in pensions and the health service. Small groups
have hurled insults, coins and vegetables at union leaders who, they claim,
have sold out and no longer represent grass-roots interests.
These incidents have underlined the potentially dangerous strategy that
union leaders have embarked on by calling mass protests. Yesterday, as well
as the strikes in Rome and the Lazio region, there was a day-long stoppage
by Italy's 3.5m public-sector employees, which paralysed ministries and
disrupted airports.
The CGIL, the largest trade union confederation, formerly dominated by the
now defunct Italian Communist party, is pressing for a general strike
against the austerity measures proposed in the 1993 budget, and to force the
government to renegotiate an outline agreement signed in July ending the
system of indexed wages. But the other two confederations, the CISL and UIL,
have refused to commit themselves, conscious that they could alienate public
support at a time when the country faces financial instability.
In contrast to these protests, Thursday's presentation of the 1993 budget
was favourably received in the press, and there were signs in parliament
that the four parties in the coalition government had accepted that few
substantive changes could be made without undermining the credibility of the
whole package.
Mr Piero Barucci, the treasury minister, said the special stand-by facility
which Italy on Thursday sought from the EC, would not be more than L17,000bn
(Pounds 7.7bn). But he added the precise amount had yet to be agreed. The
lira yesterday remained weak, floating at around 880 against the D-Mark.

FT  03 OCT 92 / French banks seeking base rate rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE is growing from French banks for a rise in base lending rates, to
stave off the losses they will soon incur as a result of the recent sharp
increase in their own cost of capital.
The banks are squeezed because the interest rate on a big source of funding,
the overnight money markets, more than doubled 10 days ago, in the wake of
the currency crisis. But commercial banks have kept base rates unchanged,
thanks to an unspoken agreement with the government to do their best to
insulate the domestic economy from the worst of the crisis.
Yesterday, French banks were paying 12.5-14 per cent for call money in the
market, well down on the more than 25 per cent at which rates peaked earlier
this week. The fall is due to the Bank of France's decision to inject more
liquidity into the markets, to relieve pressure on commercial banks.
Even so, call money rates were well over the three-month rate at which
commercial banks lend on to big business customers and compares with the 10
per cent they were paying for overnight money before the crisis hit. The
spread over base rates of 9.85 per cent is even more ruinous.
'We think the crisis will be limited in duration, and we want to limit the
damage to companies, so we are prepared to hold base rates,' said Mr
Jean-Pierre Bordereau, director of state-owned Credit Lyonnais' balance
sheet department. But he added that if the crisis lasted for more than two
more weeks, 'we will need a rapid and large rise in base rates.'
Other observers fear it take only a week.
'For the past week or so, the banks have been financing the French economy
at a loss. We cannot last like that for a very long time,' said the
Association Francaise des Banques.
How long the French banks can survive without a rise in base rates depends
partly on whether money market rates continue down and partly on banks'
ability to find cheap sources of funds off the money markets, mainly from
their own reserves and deposits.
Here French banks are more vulnerable than some of their international
competitors, because they have all seen their deposits eroded in recent
years by the success of their own money market funds, similar to unit
trusts, which with the help of favourable tax treatment have attracted
fortunes away from customers' current accounts.
At present FFr1,203bn (Pounds 141bn) is invested in these funds - Sicav
monetaires - by individuals as well as by small companies seeking a good
return on their cash balances.
Anecdotal evidence says the largest banks have responded to the crisis by
withholding or delaying loans, because they are so closely monitored by the
government that they are afraid to lift lending rates. Smaller, less closely
monitored banks have discreetly lifted rates for individual customers. Some
corporate borrowers have reacted by cashing in their Sicav units with the
banks, so adding to the banks' own requirements for capital, which they may
have to seek on the money markets.
Any bank with a wide retail network and heavy customer deposits will be
relatively well placed to ride out the crisis. This includes co-operative
banks, like Credit Agricole with its more than 8,400 branches, and to a
lesser extent the leading retail banks like Credit Lyonnais, Banque
Nationale de Paris - which says it has managed to keep going by lending from
its own cash - and Societe Generale.
Banks with small retail networks are likely to be more reliant on borrowings
for capital needs, and therefore more sensitive to money market rate rises.
A prime example is the Banque Francaise de Commerce Exterieur, as well as
pillars of the French banking industry like Suez and Paribas.
All this presents the government with a difficult choice. It can either
lower the Bank of France's official intervention rate, which influences
market rates, at the risk of provoking another run on the franc. Or it can
leave rates as they are, at the risk of further throttling the economy, just
six months before a general election.
Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, a centrist former cabinet minister, made a comeback
in France's Socialist-led government yesterday, taking the sensitive
Agriculture Ministry in a minor cabinet shakeup triggered by the departure
of two ministers for the Senate, Reuter reports from Paris.
President Francois Mitterrand appointed Mr Martin Malvy, the government
spokesman, as budget minister. Outgoing agriculture minister Louis Mermaz
replaced Mr Malvy as minister for relations with parliament and government
spokesman.

POLAND yesterday granted its first post-war exploration concession to Amoco,
the US petroleum company, which is to spend Dollars 20m (Pounds 11.2m) on
looking for oil and gas south of Warsaw and east of Lublin, near the former
Soviet frontier.
The deal, covering rights to 10,000 sq km, arises from a contract signed in
1989 for Amoco to do a survey based on what was known of Poland's domestic
energy resources.
It comes in the midst of tendering by other foreign companies for oil
exploration rights to a further 35,000 sq km of the country. A tender has
also just closed for coal bed methane gas exploration; six foreign
companies, including Amoco, applied.
Poland is dependent on supplies of Russian gas for two-thirds of its 13bn
cubic metres annual consumption, while almost all its oil is imported from
Russia and the Middle East.
Natural gas reserves are now put at 170bn cu m, while as yet undocumented
resources are estimated at 630bn cu m The World Bank has granted the state a
Dollars 250m loan for the development of the gas industry while the European
Investment Bank has provided Dollars 60m.
Russia's top corruption fighter yesterday accused crooked western
businessmen of siphoning off three-quarters of the profits due to his
country from its dwindling sales of oil abroad, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Mikhail Gurtovoy, who heads a government anti-corruption team, said
Russia, pushed by its need for foreign investment in the energy sector, had
let in a 'swarm of petty crooks' from abroad when it allowed foreign and
Russian companies to set up oil-producing joint ventures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWEDEN was yesterday placed on the review list for future possible
downgrading by Moody's, the New York international credit agency.
At present the country has a foreign currency debt rating of AA1, the second
highest possible.
The announcement came as Sweden's Central Bank cut its overnight lending
rate to the country's commercial banks from 24 per cent to 20 per cent, in a
further step designed to calm the markets in the aftermath of the week's
all-party crisis package to reduce Sweden's industrial costs.
Short-term market interest rates also fell yesterday.
The Central Bank also revealed in its latest weekly report of capital
movements that SKr15.1bn (Pounds 1.6bn) of capital flowed out of Sweden
during the last six days of September.
This provided the sombre background for the second package of austerity
measures in a fortnight to be agreed between the government and the main
Social Democratic opposition.
Moody's said that there were several factors behind its decision to place
Sweden on its review list.
It pointed to the likely slowdown in the country's economic stabilisation
and reform programme because of the increased weakness in the European
economy, its sluggish growth, which was likely to strain the financial
position of various economic sectors and of the government, and Sweden's
relatively large external debt, which might 'prove a heavier burden in the
context of more volatile exchange markets'.
The credit agency acknowledged that the recent all-party economic agreement
would strengthen the credibility of the country's anti-inflation policy, but
it added that a strong krona policy could prove to be a costly one.
Moody's review of Sweden would therefore 'focus on the policy's
sustainability'. It added that 'a de facto krona appreciation vis-a-vis
Sweden's major trading partners would have a negative effect on growth in
the near future.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / BAOR becomes ARRC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BIELEFELD, GERMANY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE fighting part of Britain's Rhine Army yesterday donned a new identity as
the leading element of Nato's new, multinational rapid reaction corps.
The corps, involving forces from 12 of the 16 allies, is the centrepiece of
a new strategy designed to retain Nato's relevance after the Cold War.
The corps is to be fully formed by 1995 and able to deploy up to about
80,000 troops.
Its purpose is to keep a nucleus of soldiers at a state of readiness similar
to that of Nato forces previously.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, spoke of the corps at its
inauguration as the 'strong arm' of Nato. Although its primary function was
to defend Nato territory, parts of it could in future be used further
afield, for instance in peace-keeping.
At yesterday's ceremony, the 1st (British) Corps - based in Bielefeld for
the last 39 years - was placed in 'suspended animation'. Its last commander,
Lt-Gen Sir Jeremy Mackenzie, takes over as first commander of the new Nato
corps, known as the ARRC.
The strains of Deutschland uber Alles played by a German army band echoed
across the parade ground of a one-time Wehrmacht camp lined with contingents
from Nato's variegated armies - kilted Highlanders, pith-helmeted English
bandsmen, lance-carrying Italians and blond-haired Danes.
Even the noises betrayed national distinctions - the near-silence of German
soldiers marching in rubber boots, contrasting with the thundering footfall
of a platoon of exceptionally tall and forbidding Turks.
The British Army, which is making the biggest contribution to the corps and
will account for 60 per cent of its 300-strong headquarters staff, sees the
corps as a means of keeping itself in the military front rank.
With the inauguration of the new formation, the British army sheds many of
the connotations of an occupying force, which have lingered on since the
1944 invasion.
In early 1994, the Nato corps is due to transfer to the present headquarters
of the British Army of the Rhine at Rheindahlen, 100 miles to the
south-west. The BAOR will then cease to exist and become instead UK Support
Command (Germany).
'It doesn't exactly trip off the tongue, does it?' commented a senior
British officer.

The output of western German industry recovered by 1.5 per cent in August
after five months of steady decline, according to the latest government

The seasonally adjusted monthly figure was not enough, however, to offset an

cent.
There was a 1.0 per cent cut in output in both electricity and gas supplies,
and in the mining industry, in August.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank president's Bavarian charm was not entirely lacking
yesterday.
Asked by a reporter from England whether he had given thought to
strengthening the central bank's public affairs activities after the
misunderstandings of recent days, Mr Helmut Schlesinger quipped: 'Am I to
take this as an application for a job in our public relations department?'
His comment came after the bank's press conference, at which he was,
however, pointedly subdued.
He made no direct mention of the controversy over the Bundesbank's own role
in the currency market upheavals of recent weeks, at least during the formal
part of his speech.
When asked about it afterwards, he referred questioners to the bank's
statement of Thursday calling for calm and the resumption of 'trusting'
relations with London.
He devoted a large part of his speech to an assessment of economic
conditions in the former East Germany.
As always, he was at his happiest discussing technical matters.
He feigned complete ignorance when asked to respond to a question in English
about recent events, saying that he had read and heard so many words in
English recently, which he simply had not understood, that he had no wish to
say anything in this language.
Alluding to his surroundings in the 19th-century castle at Schwerin, which
used to be the seat of the dukes of Mecklenburg, he said he could not speak
English here as 'up until two years ago English was not everybody's second
language', and he wanted local people to understand what he was saying.
The core of his speech was devoted to a defence of the Bundesbank's interest
rate policy.
He said the council yesterday had decided that there would be no lowering of
interest rates under present circumstances, repeating the view that domestic
circumstances gave no scope for an easing of interest rate policy.
He insisted, however, that German interest rates were not as high as often
perceived, particularly long-term interest rates.
He said that interest rates on long-term government bonds at around 7.5 per
cent were actually lower than before German unification and that these rates
were no higher than the average for Germany over the last 25 years.
Moreover, only three other countries had lower long-term interest rates  -
Japan, Switzerland and the US. 'Really, our interest rates are not so high
as often portrayed.'
He also pointed to the fall in money market rates over the last month,
saying that at just below 9 per cent the overnight money market rate was
0.8-0.9 percentage points lower than at the beginning of September.
He said he was satisfied with the current orientation of monetary policy.
The aim was to keep money market rates below 9 per cent in order to
encourage a reversal of the massive flows into the D-Mark over recent weeks.
The inflows had amounted to DM92bn (Pounds 37bn) in September; but with
rates at current levels there had been a noticeable but as yet
unquantifiable outflow in the last week.
Asked whether he had considered resigning before his term expires next
summer, Mr Schlesinger said 'No - why should I so long as God grants me good
health and I retain the trust of my colleagues?'
It was all very low-key. Indeed, the Bundesbank's presence in the town of
Schwerin yesterday provided less excitement than the preparations for
today's German unity celebrations. Tents were being erected everywhere and
portable loos brought in by the lorry-load.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metal prices take a tumble
 -Week in the Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASE METAL prices on the London Metal Exchange began the week as they meant
to go on - downwards.
'The metal markets have been disembowelled,' said one analyst of Monday,
when prices fell across the board. Heavy selling of copper, zinc and nickel
reflected growing fears that the sluggish state of worldwide economic
recovery would continue for some time.
Economic data coming from the US, Japan and Germany - the major outlets for
base metals - have reinforced the gloom over the week, suggested Mr Nick
Moore, analyst with Ord Minnett. Growth in OECD countries had been
postponed, and the markets could only wait for producers to show some
restraint.
Obvious signs of the strain of low prices on producers emerged with news
that Inco, the world's largest nickel producer with about 25 per cent of the
market, was in talks with unions about action to stem losses. 'We have a
number of options, including production shutdowns or shorter work weeks,'
said Mr Bob Allen, Inco's vice-president of corporate affairs, on Tuesday.
He dismissed as 'absurd' market talk that the company, which produces about
113,000 tonnes of nickel a year, might cut production for six months.
Nickel demand has been depressed by a fall in stainless steel production,
which accounts for about 60 per cent of nickel consumption, and by big
increases in Russian exports to the west.
Inco's production costs are thought to be about Dollars 3.25 a lb for
nickel. Last night cash nickel closed at Dollars 6,705 a tonne, down Dollars
165 on the week, and equivalent to Dollars 3.04 a lb. News that Inco plans
to make a statement on Monday came too late to affect the market.
Low aluminium prices are delaying the start of work on new smelting
capacity, according to Mr Harry Helton, an executive vice-president at
Reynolds Metals, the second biggest US aluminium group. He believes the west
needs to build 13 new smelters at about Dollars 1bn each by the year 2002 to
keep pace with demand. But before investment could proceed, the industry
needed to see a sustained price of between 80 and 85 cents a lb, equivalent
to between Dollars 1,763 and Dollars 1,873 a tonne.
Last night cash aluminium closed at Dollars 1,212.50, down Dollars 27 on the
day having recovered from earlier eight-month lows. Aluminium fell on every
day of the week, closing down Dollars 61.
Rising stocks have put pressure on the copper market this week, cash copper
closing yesterday at Pounds 1,331.50, down Pounds 62 on the week. LME
warehouse stocks were up 3,650 tonnes on Tuesday and a further 4,875 tonnes
yesterday, taking them to the highest level since March at 296,750 tonnes.
Stocks on New York's Comex are at a five-year high of 51,025 short tons
(2,000 lbs each).
However, the recent price weakness reflected only a correction to the sharp
gains of June and July, said Mr Wiktor Bielski, analyst with Carr Kitkat &amp;
Aitken. In a special report on copper this week, he suggested that copper
demand could rise by 2.5 per cent next year on renewed economic growth in
Japan and the US. This would result in a supply deficit of about 200,000
tonnes compared with a 75,000 tonne deficit this year, and trigger some
sharp price spikes.
The International Coffee Organisation's talks on a new pact lasted through
Wednesday night to end on Thursday at 7am with the feeling that something -
although not much - had been accomplished in 10 days. As one New York
analyst put it: 'At least they didn't strangle each other like they did in
July.'
Analysts believe it is now just possible that a new agreement can be agreed
by the end of the year at meetings starting at the end of next month.
However, serious subjects such as prices and market share have yet to be
broached.
The markets have been a little ambivalent towards the ICO talks. London's
November robusta contract closed yesterday at Dollars 802 a tonne, down
Dollars 2 on the week, having at one stage fallen as low as Dollars 763.
The gold market weathered a sharp hike in the overnight cost of leasing
gold. The glitch in an otherwise smooth week followed a central bank's
unexpected removal from the market of 1.4m troy ounces of gold which it had
swapped (sold with a commitment to buy back at an agreed price and date).
Usually such swaps are rolled over.
However, by the end of the week leasing rates were easing back to more
normal levels, and gold closed yesterday at Dollars 348.15 a troy ounce,
just Dollars 1.20 down on the week.

FT  03 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Upgrades boost stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UPGRADES in profits estimates for Storehouse by four leading securities
houses boosted shares in the clothing group yesterday as it hinted at
buoyant sales just before it moved into the closed period when companies are
inhibited from commenting on trading progress. SG Warburg, UBS Phillips and
Drew, Nomura and County NatWest all raised forecasts, the range increasing
by around Pounds 5m to a range of Pounds 34m-Pounds 39m. Sales increases at
both Mothercare and BHS are credited for the upgrades, although some
analysts also highlighted the group's restructuring measures and more
focused management strategy.
However, it was also pointed out that the figures compare with weak sales in
the comparable period and that trading has fallen somewhat in the last two
weeks as poor summer weather has affected the autumn selling season.
Ms Kimlan Cook at County NatWest, who changed to a buyer of the stock two
weeks ago, estimates that group sales are up around 9 per cent in the fist
half this year, with Mothercare up 12 per cent and BHS 11 per cent.
Storehouse shares climbed 6 to 148p and also gave a boost to other clothing
retailers, among which Next added 5 tp 105p and Burton 2 to 41 1/2p.
Utilities active
After the shock of the price cuts in water supply ordered by Ofwat, some
brokers took the opportunity to reassess prospects for the utility sector to
allow for possible further regulatory action in the future. However, the
main message was that in the current short-term economic uncertainty,
utilities continue to offer safe and strong dividend growth. Mr Peter Hyde
at Kleinwort Benson believes the downside risk for water stocks remains
long-term and that in the short-term they will perform well.
However, Mr Simon Taylor at Robert Flemings is advising clients to go
underweight in waters because of the potential for further and harsher
regulatory measures. However, Ms Donna Lury at Nikko said that water stocks,
while the most at risk to regulation of all utilities, still offer strong
defensive and recovery plays. She particularly likes Northumbrian Water, up
10 at 503p, Severn Trent, 7 to 406p, and Wessex Water 10 to 512p.
Building materials group Redland shrugged off Thursday's profit downgradings
and bounced strongly, closing as one of the best performing FT-SE stock on a
weak day in the stock market.
Buying for Monday's dividend payment, along with a re-assesment of the
company's prospects following Thursday's better than expected interim
results saw the shares jump 20 to 363p, at the day's peak.
Profit taking and the downward pressure on the market as a whole forced the
shares to surrender some of the earlier gains, but they still ended 16 up at
358p in reasonable turnover of 2.8m shares.
The shares had been in the doldrums in the period leading up to the interims
as the market wrongly anticipated a poor set of interim figures. The release
of the figures which showed a jump of nearly Pounds 10m in profits to Pounds
88.5m and the reassurance from the company that it would pay an unchanged
dividend for 1992 were however ignored on Thursday as dealers instead
focused on the clutch of profit downgradings delivered analysts.
Trafalgar House, in which Hongkong Land now has a near 15 per cent stake had
calmer session yesterday. The shares fell 4 to 85 1/2 p, around the price at
which Hongkong Land has said it wants to acquire another 15 per cent in
Trafalgar. Turnover in the ordinary shares reached 6.3m.
Business services group BET was once again at the receiving end of a
broker's downgrading, this time from Strauss Turnbull. The shares fell
another 7 to 95p.
British Telecom announced a new package of pricing mechanisms, designed to
strengthen brand loyalty. The shares shaded 1 1/2 to 355 1/2 . Talk that
enquiries to Vodafone's new Low-Call cellular operation were very
encouraging lifted the shares 7 to 340p.
Elsewhere in the sector, shares in Pilkington fell 6 to 77p,making it the
day's worst performing stock in the market, in percentage termsNews that
Cadbury-Schweppes would be making large redundancy provisions overhung the
shares, which fell back 10 to 428p, as most houses downgraded the food
group. Nomura was recommending a switch into Unilever, 17 ahead at 1077p.
Old Whispers that Dalgety, down 4 at 419p, was stalking RHM were given
little credence by the market. The shares climbed 7 to 175p. A big seller of
stock in WH Smith knocked the stores group back 14 to 426p.
In a weak breweries sector, Scottish and Newcastle retreated 18 to 412p. The
company was hosting an analysts' visit to one of its Centre Parc complexes
in Paris and lack of feedback from France appeared to be restraining the
shares yesterday. There was more bleak news for Grand Metropolitan - the
drinks group has been under pressure all week from brokers downgrades - as
US investment bank Paine Webber reduced its profit forecast. The shares shed
18 to 384p.
A recommendation from Kleinwort Benson helped Fisons gain 7 to 196p.
SmithKline Beecham held up ahead of a meeting of the US authorities on
Monday where approval is expected for Seroxat, one of the company's
frontline drugs, The shares lost a penny to 491p.
Profit taking left Enterprise Oil 5 lighter at 425p. The shares had
performed particularly well for most of the week, following news that it had
filed for a listing of its American Depositary Shares (ADR) in New York.
Investors continued to view Shell Transport, as the 'quality stock' in the
oil sector and the shares held up relatively well easing only 2 to 545p, on
turnover of 545p.
Shares in USM-listed Ramco Oil jumped 15 to 51p, after announcing it (and a
partner) had signed an exclusive exploration agreement with the Government
of Azerbaijan to develop a field in the Caspian Sea.
Shares in freight group NFC fell sharply after the company issued Pounds 80m
worth of convertible bonds. The shares closed 17 down at 252p.
The news that British Airways is to postpone plans to proceed with the
implementation of its Dollars 750m purchase of a 44 per cent stake in USAir
upset the shares which eased 6 to 289p. Sellers were seen in P&amp;O and the
shares retreated 12 to 398p. Profit taking in BAA left the shares 14 lighter
at 713p.
In engineers, TI Group jumped 16 to 298p, on further appreciation of the
lower than anticipated provisions made for the Dowty Group acquisition.
Sentiment was also boosted by the appreciating dollar.
Siebe, normally a beneficiary of an improved dollar retreated 18 to 341p,
with broker Williams de Broe reported to have a large line of the stock on
its books. The stock was also said to have suffered from switching into TI
Group. British Steel was in demand. The shares hardened 1 1/2 to 62 1/2 p,
as turnover swelled to 13m. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and Goldman Sachs were said
to have been active.

FT  03 OCT 92 / London Stock Exchange: Setback as interest rate hopes fade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market yesterday paid dearly for the interest rate optimism
which had sustained it earlier in the week. Gains in share prices were
sharply reversed as sterling crumbled after hopes of rate cuts in Germany
and in the US were dashed. The two-week equity trading account ended on a
sour note with the FT-SE Index showing a fall of more than 22 points on the
day.
The deepening setback in the pound now casts serious questions over whether
another early cut in UK base rates is possible, according to Mr Ian Harnett,
strategist at Strauss Turnbull. The stock market had been hoping for a
further one point reduction in base rates, perhaps ahead of next week's
annual conference of the Conservative party, when Mr John Major, the UK
prime minister, must defend his stated intention to pass the Maastricht
legislation during this parliamentary session.
Political worries depressed equities at first but share prices rose quickly
behind a firm opening in stock index futures. The Footsie was quickly ahead
by 12.7 points before it began to fade as it awaited confirmation that the
Bundesbank was leaving interest rates unchanged.
But the slide in equities gathered pace significantly after better
employment data than expected in the US appeared to eliminate the chances of
a further easing in Federal Reserve credit policy at present.
With sterling nearly eight pfennigs down against the DM and the Dow
Industrial Average 31 off at the London close, the Footsie did well to rally
for a final reading of 2,549.7, a net loss on the day of 22.6. Seaq volume
fell to 599.8m shares from Thursday's 823m, which was worth Pounds 1.4bn in
retail business, maintaining the improved customer business levels seen
since sterling left the ERM network.
The stock market has fallen by around 2 per cent this week as sterling's
weakness and calls for the resignation of Mr Norman Lamont, the UK
chancellor of the exchequer, have unsettled expectations that UK base rates
could be cut to 8 per cent by Christmas. However, over the two-week account,
the fall in the Footsie has been only about 0.7 per cent.
Government bonds gave back early gains and closed lower as sterling fell.
Losses among the long dates were no more than  1/16 with the shorts showing
similar losses. Index-linked also gave back gains.
After receding from the levels which followed sterling's withdrawal from the
ERM, retail volume has begun to rise again.

<TEXT>
THE FALL in sterling as hopes of interest rate cuts in Germany and the US
evaporated depressed derivatives markets yesterday, although trading
activity was at a low ebb, writes Terry Byland.
In stock index futures, the December contract on the Footsie lost much of
its fair value premium on this week and also for the new equity account
which opens on Monday; fair value is the premium against the cash market
after allowing for dividend flows and financing costs on the underlying
stocks.
The December contract had an erratic session, opening lower and then moving
higher, only to turn sharply downwards at the end of the day. At its best
level of around 2,636, the contract could not match the best of the previous
day.
In after hours dealings, the contract traded around 2,575, a premium of 26
to cash and at a discount of around nine on next week's estimated fair value
of 35. Total volume was extremely low at 9,827
Traded options was steadier, at 35,791, with the FT-SE contract trading
9,046 contracts and Trafalgar House (3,272) also active. Glaxo headed the
list of stock options.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Unlocking value for shareholders - Richard
Gourlay considers the departure of Chubb from Racal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MONDAY official trading will begin in Chubb Security and what is left of
its erstwhile parent, Racal Electronics, as Sir Ernest Harrison, its
chairman, continues to break up the group he founded 27 years ago.
As expected, Racal's shareholders yesterday approved the demerger. Now
instead of the five old Racal shares they held, they will have one new Racal
and one Chubb.
It was the last formality before the security company was able to float free
of the group it has nurtured with its cash flow for much of the eight years
it has been part of it.
Looking back on Racal's exceptionally successful 1991 demerger of Vodafone,
the cellular network service, shareholders might be tempted to think their
feisty chairman's latest ruse to enhance shareholder's value will be equally
rewarding.
This may be so. But with the two companies telling completely different
stories, Racal shareholders face an interesting decision whether to hold or
dispose of their shares at current prices.
Chubb is one of the oldest and best known brand names in the security market
and the thoroughbred in Racal Electronics' stable once Vodafone was split
off.
As the poor cousin of Vodafone, Chubb was languishing, the victim of a
lamentable lack of management attention which, perhaps understandably, was
focused on the rise and rise of Vodafone.
The arrival of Mr David Peacock as chief executive brought the slide to an
abrupt halt. With falling interest and exceptional charges and rising
margins, Chubb's brokers are forecasting that earnings per share will grow
by 83 per cent, 20 per cent and 17 per cent over the next three years.
Clearly the fact that there is scope for such an improvement is testimony to
the laxity of the previous management. It also means that Chubb shareholders
should enjoy three years of above average earnings growth, even without any
sales-led expansion.
If Mr Peacock manages to exploit its strong brands, including Chubb, Union,
Lips and Pyrene, and expand what is still a relatively small share of its
markets, earnings progression could be even better.
These forecasts alone would seem enough to support a hold recommendation at
yesterday's closing price in the grey market of 201p, which represents a 30
per cent premium to the market.
There is also the possibility that Chubb might become the target for a
predator.
Williams Holdings bought Yale &amp; Valor, the locks company, last year for
Pounds 406m, the same as the company's annual sales. On that basis Chubb
should be worth Pounds 670m, which is 20 per cent above the Pounds 560m
market capitalisation implied by the grey market closing price. -.
Racal Electronics, shorn of Chubb, is a different story. Racal's
profitability recovered strongly in the year to the end of March and is
likely to continue to improve again this financial year.
But the mixture of businesses - data communications, commercial and military
radio, marine services, defence radar and avionics and network services - is
coming from a low base.
Adjusted to exclude Vodafone and Chubb, Racal would have made an operating
loss of Pounds 11.5m in the year to March 31 1991, swinging to a profit of
Pounds 49.3m on sales of Pounds 937.3m the following year. But that is only
an operating margin of about 5 per cent.
The main problem is data communications, which accounts for nearly a third
of sales but barely broke even at the operating level.
Racal is aware that data communications, mainly data modems, which is
increasingly becoming a commodity business, is the area that requires
immediate attention. Mr David Elsbury, the chief executive says he is
addressing this issue.
But analysts point out that the management that got Racal into this dismal
operating condition is broadly the same one as is at the helm today.
That does not mean shareholders should necessarily dump their holdings.
Again reduced interest and exceptional charges will be a tremendous boost to
earnings. And if the turnround at data communications is accompanied by
further improvement at the radio division - and both propositions are less
than certain - the share price would be underpinned by above average
earnings growth.
More to the point, at yesterday's grey market closing price of 129p Racal
ex-Chubb would have a market capitalisation of Pounds 359m, representing a
discount to net asset value. .
Any further share price fall would mean that a bid was on the cards.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Littlewoods expansion includes third store
in St Petersburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LITTLEWOODS, the privately-owned pools and retail group, will open an Index
catalogue shop in St Petersburg later this month expanding its trading
presence in Russia to three stores.
The company is also stepping up its expansion programme in the UK opening 10
stores over the next month creating 250 jobs. By the end of October, Index
will have a chain of 128 outlets providing greater competition for Argos,
which is currently the clear market leader in the catalogue shop sector.
Littlewoods entered the Russian market a year ago when it opened one hard
currency and one rouble store in the Gostinii Dvor shopping complex in St
Petersburg.
Although the stores have recorded strong sales they have had grave problems
combatting shoplifting and more violent break-ins. Littlewoods has had to
employ a team of security guards and take measures to prevent criminals
entering the stores by smashing its windows.
The Index store in St Petersburg will trade alongside the two other
Littlewoods outlets. It will sell about two-thirds of the 2,000 lines
normally stocked in Index stores in the UK and accept payments either in
hard currencies or roubles.
Mr James Higginbotham, Index managing director, said he was well aware of
the need for additional security measures. He added that Index would
consider opening more stores in Russia after fully evaluating whether the
catalogue concept was suitable for the local market.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clifford Foods declines 60%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLIFFORD FOODS, the dairy products,fruit juice and food group which issued a
profits warning in July, yesterday reported a 60 per cent decline in pre-tax
profits which fell from Pounds 2.55m to Pounds 1.03m in the first half of
1992.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 70.1m, compared with Pounds 70.3m.
As foreshadowed by Mr John Clifford, chairman, in the group's 1991 report
and accounts, the period was affected by the substantial costs of
modernising the Kidlington dairy, turning it into an automated carton milk
unit.
Profits were further reduced by the effects of the continuing recession on
the sales of convenience foods by Danby's Foods and Roy's Quality Foods, and
particularly by price-cutting among companies supplying milk in
non-returnable containers to supermarkets, an area which generates more than
a quarter of group turnover.
Operating profits fell to Pounds 1.33m (Pounds 2.93m) with a further Pounds
120,000 (Pounds 126,000) from associates. Net interest payments declined to
Pounds 380,000, against Pounds 401,000.
During the latest period the company said fruit juices and drinks continued
to perform well, as did doorstep milk rounds which are now about two-thirds
franchised. Meanwhile Morton Food's new crumb factory generated significant
new business.
Mr Martin Bunting, chief executive, said the group expected trading levels
in the second half to be significantly better than in either the first half
or the 1991 second half. Poor weather in July and August depressed fruit
juice sales, but milk prices have been increased.
In addition Mr Bunting noted that the group's new fruit juice carbonation
plant had started production in July and Roy's new factory was completed in
August, drawing a large capital expenditure programme towards a close.
Earnings per share fell by 60 per cent to 4.11p (10.23p). The company is
dipping into reserves slightly to pay an unchanged interim dividend of 4.4p
a share.

Shares in B Elliott, the machine tool and engineering company, were
suspended yesterday following warnings that it expected to make significant
losses for the year to April 3.
The company, which has seen its share price fall in the past 18 months from
80p to 3p yesterday, announced the suspension while talks continued with
lending banks on restructuring the group.
The talks were initiated earlier this year following interim results which
showed a Pounds 2.6m trading loss in the machine tools business.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Clarke Foods' shares suspended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLARKE FOODS, the UK's second largest ice-cream maker and owner of Lyons
Maid, is facing a severe cash crisis which yesterday resulted in the
suspension of its USM-quoted shares at 8p.
The company is seeking an urgent capital injection which would buy time for
the arrangement of a rights issue or some other form of equity finance.
The shares have fallen rapidly from their peak of 163p just four months ago,
as Clarke encountered problems with the installation of equipment.
As a result, the company missed the two hottest months of the summer and
achieved only 25 per cent of planned ice-cream sales. A Pounds 4m
advertising campaign was virtually wasted as many consumers were unable to
find the product in shops.
Last month Clarke recalled the interim dividend and announced it was in
discussions with National Westminster about an overdraft facility. However,
NatWest has demanded proof of a capital injection before agreeing to provide
short-term working capital.
The company is believed to be in talks with Hillsdown Holdings, which holds
more than 20 per cent of Clarke, about a possible solution.
Any injection is likely to result in changes to the board, of which Mr Henry
Clarke, the inspiration and driving force behind Clarke Foods, is chairman.
The Clarke family holding is also likely to be diluted from its current 25
per cent.
Mr Clarke's ice-cream pedigree goes back several years, to his promotion of
the Klondike bar, America's best selling novelty ice-cream, in the 1970s. He
has also had a volatile history, having been ousted from two separate
companies.
Mr Clarke came out of a brief retirement to enter the UK ice-cream market
through the USM-quoted investment vehicle, Yelverton Investments, which was
transformed into Clarke Foods. The company owns the Fiesta, Horton and Lewis
brands, purchased from Hillsdown Holdings in 1991, and Lyons Maid, bought in
January from Allied-Lyons.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders at Trafalgar House, the property, construction
and engineering group, under siege from Hongkong Land, yesterday indicated
they were unlikely to sell any more shares.
Hongkong Land, one of the colony's leading property investment and
development companies, has acquired 14.99 per cent of Trafalgar and is
tendering for another 15 per cent. It has until the end of next week to try
and increase its stake to 29.9 per cent.
Six of Trafalgar's 10 biggest shareholders, which sold between 5 and 15 per
cent of their stock on Thursday, said they were unlikely to sell any more
shares.
One institutional shareholder said: 'Since Hongkong Land has set a floor of
85p - the price at which they bought the ordinary shares - there is little
incentive for us to sell any more.'
Some shareholders are also hoping that another company may be tempted to
make a full bid for the group.
However, any hopes that this could come from Hanson, the Anglo-US
conglomerate, were dashed yesterday by Lord Hanson. 'Trafalgar is much more
something for Hongkong Land on a long-term basis than it would be for
Hanson.'
Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, is also a non-executive
director of Hanson.
Trafalgar is preparing to send a circular to its shareholders on Tuesday
telling them that net borrowings for the financial year ended September 30
are less than Pounds 400m.
Sir Eric Parker, chief executive, said: 'Hongkong Land's tender offer is an
attempt to gain effective control of all our assets for an investment of
some Pounds 175m. We are determined to try and stop them buying any more of
our shares.'
Trafalgar has also asked its financial advisers, Kleinwort Benson, to seek
buyers for its hotels, which include the Ritz and the Stafford.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Scottish TV nearly doubled at Pounds 2.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH TELEVISION yesterday announced improved pre-tax profits of Pounds
2.2m against Pounds 1.16m for the half year to June 30.
'In a period when trading conditions throughout the country stubbornly
refused to improve these results are very satisfactory,' Mr Bill Brown, the
chairman, said.
There was a rise in programme sales from Pounds 7.73m to Pounds 9.5m and
underlying costs in the main television business continued to fall, the
company said.
Scottish benefited from a reduction in the Exchequer Levy from Pounds 2.3m
to Pounds 549,000, but there was also an exceptional charge of Pounds 2m to
pay for voluntary early leavers and redundancies.
Scottish, which retained its franchise unopposed with an annual bid of
Pounds 2,000, said that it had been using this year for intensive
preparation for the new 10-year licence period which begins in January.
'With the substantial reduction in our cost base we shall be able to take
full advantage of the favourable conditions on which the licence was
obtained,' Mr Brown said.
Despite the depths of the recession, Scottish said its full-year result
would be substantially ahead of last year's Pounds 8.6m. Mr Neil Blackley,
media analyst at stockbrokers James Capel, is forecasting Pounds 13.5m after
Pounds 4m in exceptionals.
Scottish believes that ITV will continue to be the most watched channel
despite growing competition and that there will be real growth in airtime
sales income across the decade.
Turnover at Pounds 57.2m was up from Pounds 52.1m. Earnings per share rose
from 1.6p to 2.9p and the interim dividend is lifted from an adjusted
1.4375p to 1.725p.
Turnover at the company's main non-television business, the Pauline Hyde
outplacement agency, rose from Pounds 4.12m to Pounds 4.66m.
Although the result was in line with expectations Scottish Television's
share price closed yesterday 21p down on the day at 418p.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Fisons US operations chief resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of US operations at Fisons, the pharmaceuticals, scientific
instruments and horticultural products company, has resigned following the
group's failure to clinch the reintroduction of two of its withdrawn
products in the American market.
Mr Stephen Attwood, president of Fisons Corporation and a director on the
group's pharmaceuticals board, is leaving the company after 20 years. He was
responsible for US sales and marketing operations as well as local
regulatory affairs.
Fisons said the departure was entirely amicable.
Fisons' first half profits, announced last month, fell 58 per cent after
pharmaceuticals sales fell Pounds 16m to Pounds 206m following the drugs'
withdrawal. Mr Cedric Scroggs, chief executive, said the sales decline was
unusual and unpalatable.
Opticrom, an eye treatment, was withdrawn from the US in 1989 after the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA), the US drug licensing body, criticised
production methods. In spite of a visit by FDA officials in April, the
product is still not available in the US. The company said the fall in
operating profits at the pharmaceuticals division from Pounds 68.1m to
Pounds 23.1m for the first six months was partly caused by the absence of
Opticrom and related problems.
The company has yet to decide whether to reapply for a licence for Imferon,
a blood product, which was pulled in 1990. The cost of refurbishing the
manufacturing facilities would be as much as Pounds 30m.
Fisons has also failed to gain a US licence for Tilade, its new asthma
treatment, which was expected to be launched on the American market two
years ago.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Chubb faces strike threat over wage freeze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHUBB GROUP could face strike action over its attempt to impose a six month
wage freeze on the 530 workers in the lock, key and safe manufacturing parts
of the company.
The union which represents the workers believes that in the course of the
demerger with Racal Electronics the Chubb directors have placed the
company's image with City investors above fair treatment of employees.
Mr Michael Bradley, leader of the National Union of Lock and Metal Workers,
said that Chubb was expecting a 35 per cent increase in profits to Pounds
28m in the seven months to October 9 and yet had imposed a pay freeze in
August.
'We weren't happy about the pay freeze in the light of those profits. We
think it's political. They are just doing it to impress the City with how
tough they are,' said Mr Bradley.
After talks with the union the company agreed to pay a 4.5 per cent increase
from February next year, which would be the equivalent of an annualised
increase of 2.25 per cent.
But that was rejected by the union which then balloted its members on strike
action. A total of 499 workers out of 530 voted for strike action.
Mr Bradley said that he believed a similar wage freeze had been imposed on
employees in other Chubb companies and that so far it had been accepted.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Former directors' payments push James
Wilkes into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAYMENTS to former directors helped to push James Wilkes, the engineer which
earlier this year fought off a hostile bid from rival Petrocon, into the red
with interim pre-tax losses of Pounds 316,000, against a profit of Pounds
2.75m last year.
About Pounds 1m was paid to four former directors, including ex-chairman Mr
Stephen Hinchliffe who left the board during the Petrocon bid. The
compensation payments were taken above the line for a total exceptional
charge of Pounds 1.4m, compared with a Pounds 338,000 gain last year.
Mr Arthur Watt, chairman, said the company had suffered difficult trading
conditions, particularly in the Presto machine tool and Deritend printing
press subsidiaries. Sales in these two businesses had fallen by Pounds 3m to
Pounds 4m in the first half, with profits down by Pounds 1m.
However, sales for the group as a whole were just Pounds 923,000 down at
Pounds 28.4m. Operating profits for the six months to June 30 fell from
Pounds 4m to Pounds 2.96m. Continuing businesses reported operating profits
of Pounds 2.66m.
Mr Watt said Wilkes' remaining businesses had performed as well as, if not
better than, last year. He said he expected the first half trading pattern
to continue for the rest of the year. However, he added that he would be
'devastated' if Wilkes remained in the red for the full year, before
extraordinary items.
The chairman expected gearing to remain at the current 92 per cent, which
was 72 points lower than last year. Interest charges were slightly higher at
Pounds 1.9m (Pounds 1.6m).
The battle against Petrocon's bid cost Wilkes Pounds 1.6m in extraordinary
items. The Pounds 612,000 loss on the sale of the aviation division was also
taken below the line. Total extraordinary charges came to Pounds 5.1m,
including the accounting requirement to write back Pounds 7.6m in goodwill
which had previously written off.
As a result the retained loss was Pounds 6m, compared with a profit of
Pounds 990,000. The interim dividend was cut by 1.5p to 3.25p while the loss
per share was 2.3p (10.4p earnings).

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Davies &amp; Newman faces drop in borrowing
ceiling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVIES &amp; Newman, owner of the Dan-Air airline, is facing a considerably
lower borrowing ceiling than the Pounds 35m agreed with the banks in last
year's rescue.
This prospect lies behind the attempt to refinance the company with the help
of Mr Richard Branson, owner of Virgin Atlantic Airways, who would put money
in - about Pounds 10m has been mooted - possibly through a stake in Davies &amp;
Newman. The revamped airline would incorporate the Virgin name.
The looming debt overshoot had already led Mr David James, the company
doctor-chairman at Davies &amp; Newman, to approach institutional shareholders
for another cash injection - believed to be about Pounds 40m.
This compares with last year's Pounds 49.3m, although more than Pounds 8m of
that went out to the banks in special fees.
Last year's rescue was accompanied by the setting of a Pounds 35m limit on
Davies &amp; Newman's debt. This was linked to net worth which at the beginning
of the year stood at about Pounds 41m.
Two things have happened since then to lower the debt ceiling. About Pounds
5m of aircraft have been sold, bringing the ceiling down to Pounds 30m.
In addition, instead of making a Pounds 20m pre-tax profit as projected, the
company is heading for a loss which according to one estimate could be
Pounds 10m.
Every Pounds 1 lost has the double effect of subtracting Pounds 1 from cash
generation and Pounds 1 from the debt allowed. So the debt limit is heading
for a figure nearer Pounds 20m than Pounds 30m.
The swing between peak cash and peak debt in the airline is estimated at
Pounds 40m to Pounds 50m. As Davies &amp; Newman will only just have got into
double figures at its best time for cash, a debt limit near Pounds 20m was
not going to be enough.
Mr James has reiterated that the problem is not an immediate one. He said
the latest overdraft was 'in low single figures'.
However, as less flying and more maintenance work is done in the winter, the
crunch would come next spring.
He said there was a substantial measure of agreement with Mr Branson on the
principal parts of the deal. Detailed draft documents were being prepared
and over the weekend groups of negotiators would continue to work on various
issues.
The involvement of Mr Branson should make it a great deal easier to raise
money from other investors, he added.

NET PROFIT at GIB Group, one of Belgium's two largest retail groups, slipped
from BFr1.77bn (Dollars 60.4m) to BFr1.68bn in the first half of the year
although most of the company's principal activities showed good growth.
GIB blamed the negative effects of a strike in February, which cost the
company some BFr185m, and the 'gloomy economic climate' for the drop in
profits.
Turnover rose from BFr105bn to BFr111bn, up 5.2 per cent, or 3.3 per cent
adjusted for exchange rate differences and changes in consolidating group
companies.
GIB, Belgium's largest private-sector employer, said its supermarket and
hypermarket sector had shown growth of 2 per cent - 3 per cent excluding the
effects of the strike. The company still aims to have electronic point of
sale and scanning equipment installed across all its stores by the end of
the year.

FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa plunges to SKr5.5bn
loss at 8 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRYGG-HANSA SPP, Sweden's leading insurance group, plunged into a SKr5.57bn
(Dollars 1.04bn) loss for the first eight months of the year. This compares
with a SKr1.09bn profit for the same period of 1991.
The main reason for the dramatic deterioration is the huge estimated loss of
SKr6.01bn due to its major holdings in Gota AB, the Swedish holding company,
Svenska Kredit, the leading private export credit company, and IC Holding,
the credit company, all of which are in liquidation.
The group was also hit by the fall in share prices and property values.
The losses suffered from the group's involvement in Gota are estimated to be
SKr5.51bn. Earlier this week the group appointed a receiver and went into
liquidation.
The insurance company's association with Gota has turned out to be an
unhappy one since it became its major shareholder as a result of the merger
in November 1990 between Trygg-Hansa and the SPP pension insurance group. In
April this year Trygg-Hansa SPP made a SKr1.4bn bid to buy the whole of Gota
AB.
Mr Bjorn Sprangare, chief executive of Trygg-Hansa SPP, said last night that
while the group's shareholders would be hit by the heavy losses incurred in
the first eight months, they would not affect insurance policy holders.
'Despite this considerable loss the holding company has a powerful economic
position', he added. 'The company is stronger than any other insurance
company in Sweden'.
For the first eight months Trygg Hansa SPP's insurance operations performed
positively, with a SKr333m operating profit, though this was a 41 per cent
drop from the SKr562m profit made over the same period of 1991. Premiums
earned totalled SKr5.06bn for the January-August period, which was a 4 per
cent improvement on January-August period of 1991.
Trygg-Hansa SPP also saw growth in its operating income from the Home
Holdings group in the US, in which it has a 33.3 per cent stake. For the
first six months of the year profits rose to SKr95m from SKr12m for the same
period of last year.
However, the company suffered a 60 per cent per cent drop to SKr437m in its
operating profit for all the group's activities, compared with a SKr1.09bn
profit for the same period of last year.
The decline was blamed on the dramatic fall in share values and property
prices that have hit Trygg-Hansa SPP's investment portfolio hard so far this
year.
The group showed a negative equity/assets ratio compared with 15 per cent
for the first eight months of last year and it recorded a loss of SKr58.90
per share, compared with a gain of SKr11.60 for the same period of 1991.

Mr Karl Otto Pohl, former president of the Bundesbank, is to become deputy
chairman of Corange, the Bermuda-based holding company which owns a leading
German health care concern, Boehringer Mannheim.
Corange, owned by the Engelhorn family, is undergoing a board restructuring
designed to 'help to simulate the disciplines of a public company'.
This means setting up a framework within which management will be subjected
to the same sort of independent scrutiny that public companies receive from
shareholders and analysts.
Its new board will contain no present or former members of management.
The exception is Mr Curt Engelhorn, a member of the shareholding family who
will continue as chief executive until a successor is found.
Also on the board is Mr Patrick Rich, chairman and chief executive officer
of BOC Group. Three other independent directors have been appointed with
three more to join later.
Boehringer Mannheim - which has no connection with Boehringer Ingelheim,
another German pharmaceutical company - achieved sales of Dollars 2.9bn last
year, against Dollars 2.5bn in 1990, with profits before interest and taxes
of Dollars 243m (Dollars 229m).
Its main activities are diagnostics, pharmaceuticals, orthopaedic products
(through its DePuy unit), and biochemicals.
Mr Pohl, who has begun speaking out again on world monetary issues, left the
German central bank in the summer of 1991. He is a partner in Sal.
Oppenheim, the Cologne-based private bank.

THE THREAT of industrial action loomed over USAir, the US carrier in which
British Airways is seeking to invest Dollars 750m in return for a large
minority stake, after the International Association of Machinists and
Aerospace Workers said its members appeared to have voted in favour of a
strike.
The announcement from the IAM came late yesterday afternoon. The union -
representative for over 8,000 mechanics and related workers at the airline -
acknowledged that a few smaller 'locals' (branches) were still left to vote
today. But it said results so far suggested a 'nearly unanimous vote' for
strike action.
The union added that it would set a strike date within 72 hours. 'The IAM
takes no pleasure in announcing strike plans,' said Mr John Peterpaul, IAM
transportation vice president, 'but USAir must understand our members feel
they have no choice but to stand up to company demands that would force IAM
members to carry a heavier burden than other employee groups'. He said the
union was willing to resume negotiations but no talks have been scheduled.
The strike threat comes after a contract offer from USAir which the union
claims would mean permanent wage cuts and work rule concessions. Yesterday,
the union was sharply critical of British Airways, suggesting the UK carrier
had 'imposed its heavy hand in USAir matters', even though its proposed
investment has get to gain regulatory approval.
The IAM said it was withdrawing support for the proposed link between the
two airlines. BA declined to comment.

<TEXT>
ROQUEFORT, one of France's best known smelly cheeses, yesterday escaped from
being Swiss when Nestle, the food multinational, sold a controlling slice to
Besnier, a leading French cheese supplier.
Besnier, best known for its mild creamy Pont l'Eveque cheese, has agreed to
pay Nestle FFr863m (Dollars 180.5m) for the Swiss company's 57 per cent
stake in Caves de Roquefort, valuing it at FFr1.5bn.
Caves de Roquefort used to be a subsidiary of Source Perrier, maker of the
celebrated fizzy mineral water, which Nestle took over in a contested bid
battle against Italy's Agnelli family early this year.
Roquefort's future was highly publicised at the time, as local dairy farmers
complained that a successful foreign bidder would put them out of business
by importing cheaper milk for cheese production, to the alleged detriment of
one of the most characteristic tastes in French cuisine.
Caves de Roquefort accounts for 80 per cent of world production of this
cheese and made a FFr36m profit on sales of FFr1.38bn last year.
Nestle made clear at the time of the Perrier takeover that it wanted to sell
its stake and offered Credit Agricole, the agricultural co-operative bank,
which owns 26 per cent of the cheese maker, first refusal.
Besnier won the deal against competition from France's three other leading
cheese groups, Bongrain, Entremont and Bel.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch consumer products group is also said to have been
interested.

ELF Aquitaine, the French oil group and Rhone-Poulenc, France's leading
chemicals company, yesterday announced a joint venture in plastic films,
marking an improvement in the cool relations between the two state-owned
companies.
Elf's chemicals subsidiary, Elf Atochem, is to take majority control of the
venture, Soplaril, which will have a turnover of FFr800m (Dollars 167.4m) in
four plants across Europe and be one of the region's largest producers of
food wrapping film.
Mr Loik Le Floch-Prigent, the current chairman of Elf Aquitaine, who is
close to the Socialist party, was ousted as head of Rhone-Poulenc in 1986 by
the conservative government of the time.
He was replaced by Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, a close friend of former president
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the centre-right UDF party, and
appointed to his present job at Elf by the Socialist administration in 1989.
Since then, collaboration between the two groups has been rare and relations
between their chairmen distant.

FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: Renault and Volvo plan joint new
range of luxury cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Renault and Volvo are to develop jointly a new range of top-of-the-line
executive cars to be sold in Europe from the end of the decade.
The joint car project marks a significant step forward for the two vehicle
makers, which have been developing a far-reaching alliance since September
1990.
Renault said yesterday the two groups had decided to develop a common
platform for the new range of executive cars, which would allow the use of
many common components, most importantly common engines and gearboxes.
While having a high degree of commonality 'under the skin', the cars would
have different body styles and would maintain independent Volvo and Renault
brand identities for sale through their separate distribution networks.
It is expected that the Renault version would replace its new generation
Renault Safrane executive car, launched this year in Europe to replace the
Renault 25.
According to Renault the new joint car range would replace the present Volvo
850, which has been launched by the Swedish car maker during the last 12
months.
The joint Renault/Volvo car project is taking a similar approach to that
already used by the Peugeot group for its Peugeot and Citroen marques. Its
current top-of-the-range Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 cars share a common
platform, engines and gearboxes, but maintain very separate identities in
the market.

FT  03 OCT 92 / International Company News: Japanese banks 'need more aid'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE BANKS will need more government assistance than has been announced
if they are to overcome quickly the burden of non-performing loans, a study
by Moody's Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, recommended
yesterday.
The agency examined the likely impact of tax and other concessions granted
by the government, and suggested that the measures, including the
establishment of a land purchase agency, will have a 'limited effect on the
banks' asset quality'.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Finance yesterday indicated that it would tighten
control over non-bank financial institutions, such as leasing and consumer
credit companies, by requiring those with loan portfolios of more than Y50bn
(Dollars 416.7m) to report their non-performing loans at the end of this
fiscal year.
The Japanese government has tended to blame 'non-banks' for the feverish
lending of the late 1980s, in an apparent attempt to divert attention from
the role of mainstream institutions, though many of these non-banks are
actually affiliates of the leading banks.
About 300 of Japan's estimated 37,000 non-banks would be subject to the new
rule, if implemented.
It is clear some non-banks have a heavy burden of non-performing loans, but
the ministry may not release that information for fear of undermining
confidence in the financial system.
In mid-August, the government announced a package of concessions designed to
restore confidence in the banking system and lift stock prices. Banks were
supposed to have marked their stock portfolios to market levels for the
first half ending last month, but the finance ministry gave them a reprieve.
The government lifted a limit on dividend payout ratios, broadened tax
concessions on the write-off of bad debts, and proposed the establishment of
a body that would attempt to stimulate the ailing property market by
purchasing land used as collateral.
Moody's said the banks' balance sheets would be improved if the government
made loan losses fully tax-deductible and if problem property assets were
purchased by a government agency at book value.
However, the agency said these measures would involve 'very costly
subsidies' and need political support that now appears to be lacking.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Funds for care reform win support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, announced funding arrangements
yesterday for next year's community care reforms which social services
directors and political opponents acknowledged were reasonable in the
present state of public expenditure.
She surprised delegates to the local authorities social services conference
on the Isle of Wight with an announcement that, in the early years of the
reforms, part of the finance will be subject to 'ring fence' protection to
ensure that it is spent on community care rather than on other purposes.
Next April, local authorities will become responsible for co-ordinating a
policy designed to help elderly and handicapped people to remain in the
community rather than have to enter institutions. Spending on keeping people
in private residential and nursing homes has soared from Pounds 10m in 1979
to about Pounds 2.5bn now.
Although the position of people already living in residential homes will be
unaffected, money that would have been spent on accommodating further people
will be transferred from the social security budget to local authorities.
Under the proposals, English local authorities will receive Pounds 539m in
community care grants in 1993-94 - Pounds 399m transferred from the social
security budget and a further Pounds 140m towards the start-up costs of the
new system. Sums transferred in lieu of social security expenditure that
would have been incurred under the existing system will rise to a cumulative
Pounds 1.050bn in 1994-95 and Pounds 1.568bn in 1995-96.
Mr Toby Harris, Labour chairman of the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities' social services committee, acknowledged that Mrs Bottomley had
fought 'a substantial battle to get the figure she has announced'. The AMA,
however, differs from the government over AMA calculations of growth in
people needing residential care.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Worry haunts the grey suits in Tory shires: FT reporters

debate are unlikely to survive the keen scrutiny of careful party
impresarios

MOTION FROM NORTHAMPTON SOUTH: (Tory MP Michael Morris elected 1974) This
conference asks the government to change, in the economic realities of the
1990s, the emphasis from the service industries to those that manufacture.
This conference asks for the government to give more encouragement to
industry, rather than the consumer, to lead us to a balance-of-payments
surplus.
MR JOHN PERKINS, partner of Perkins and Tustin, solicitors, is a quiet man.
Mild of demeanour, with grey suit and neat tie, he is an active Conservative
supporter of 20 years' standing. But long before Black Wednesday, he was
worried.
'A policy concentrating on inflation is just not adequate,' he said. So he
devised a motion for the party conference that goes to the heart of
government economic policy. It asks, in effect, for the government to
encourage manufacturing.
Mr Perkins wondered whether he might be thought a rebel, but he will not be
considered such in Northampton South. Local MP Mr Michael Morris, deputy
speaker of the Commons, said: 'The message from my constituents is that they
actually want practical help and assistance.'
Northampton South has a diversified industrial base and the impact of the
recession has been less severe than in, say, the West Midlands. But
unemployment doubled in the year to October 1991 from 3.5 per cent to 7.0
per cent and has since climbed to 9.0 per cent.
The seemingly effortless economic growth of the 1980s has stuttered, calling
into question basic tenets of government policy and feeding the creeping
disillusion of the local faithful.
Black Wednesday left Northampton South Conservatives unconvinced that the
government is getting to grips with the situation.
Mr Malcolm Lloyd, who has a metal-finishing business, wanted results.
Hecommented: 'Mr Major will equal Major Disaster if he's not careful.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / 'We're fishermen, not bloody accountants'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOTION FROM SCARBOROUGH: (Tory MP John Sykes elected 1992) This conference
congratulates the Danish people on their rejection of the Maastricht treaty
and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to cease any further moves towards
political and monetary union.
MR DAVE BECK, a Con-servative member of North Yorkshire County Council, is
in blunt and combative mood. 'Jacques Delors? I don't trust him. There is no
froth and bubble here. We don't want strangers meddling in the affairs of
this nation. The British people are saying enough is enough.'
Mr Beck is the author of the Scarborough and Whitby Constituency
Conservative Association's motion - approved unanimously on July 6 by the 18
members of the association's executive committee.
Mr Beck says that Tory grassroots opinion - fuelled by the narrowness of the
French referendum vote and the diplomatic shadow boxing with the Germans -
is firmly behind him.
'The government can try and cajole and use the three-line whip but the
people will not have Maastricht,' he declares.
Such sentiment can easily flourish in a town like Scarborough, a
quintessential northern resort with its mixture of fading Victorian elegance
and fish and chips.
Here people claim to have spent their history resisting foreign invasions.
The pubs have names that include Albion, Britannia and Lord Nelson.
Feelings have risen to the surface by the harbour, where the local fishing
industry blames its decline on Europe.
'This is Europe,' spits Bob Walker, a fisherman and loyal Conservative
supporter for 30 years, emerging from his trawler with two hefty files - the
Eurolog book he has to fill in every time he fishes in EC waters. 'We're
fishermen, not bloody accountants.'
His view, shared widely by local fishermen, is to blame the distant EC
bureaucracy - and the servility of the British government and navy - not
just for stifling his work with paperwork and quotas but for discriminating
in favour of non-British fishermen such as the Spaniards.
'We should police our own waters, govern ourselves,' says Mr Walker, for
whom the word subsidiarity is an empty concept dreamed up by politicians.
Some British fishermen are threatening to burn their EC log books outside
the Tory conference next week.
In the office of Mr Robert Ashman, the Conservative agent and secretary, on
the first floor of the elegant Victorian building housing the Scarborough
Conservative club, the portraits of Mr Major are outnumbered by those of
Churchill and Mrs Thatcher.
But Mr Ashman is no fanatical Euro-sceptic and is anxious to point out that
not all local Conservatives are anti-European. 'Undoubtedly there are some
who want nothing to do with Europe, but they are in a minority. The majority
simply are worried by a sudden rush into Europe. There is no hard and fast
anti-European attitude.'
Downstairs in the bar, opinion among the elderly rank and file - many of
whom had no knowledge of next week's motion - bears out his assessment.
Mr Ron Meade declares himself 'all for Europe', as he downs a pint of local
bitter.

FT  03 OCT 92 / BT will improve business discounts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday announced an improved range of
discounts for business telecommunications users as part of its attempt to
stem the loss of its most profitable customers to Mercury Communications,
its main rival.
Business customers are being offered a cut in charges of about 3 per cent to
4 per cent from next January.
Mercury, which has concentrated on providing services to businesses, said it
was committed to remaining competitive, but would not necessarily make a
'knee-jerk response' to BT's move.
Business customers are likely to receive a second round of price cuts in the
next few months when BT announces annual changes in its standard charges.
The company is required by Oftel, its regulator, to cut the price of a
basket of its main services by an amount equivalent to the rise in the
retail prices index minus 6.25 percentage points.

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: A time to test the strengths of the rising
son - Robert Hanson talks to Roland Rudd about his promotion to the board of
the family firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE son rises, the share price often falls. Fund managers are nervous
about backing companies managed on dynastic rather than meritocratic
principles.
So the appointment of Mr Robert Hanson to the board of Hanson, the
Anglo-American conglomerate created by his father Lord Hanson, has raised
eyebrows among fund managers, who fear the promotion smacks of nepotism.
Last week, after news of Mr Hanson's promotion to the board chaired by his
father, the company's shares dropped 3p on a day the market rallied.
Mr Hanson, who celebrates his 32nd birthday today, is adamant it was
coincidence. 'The idea that I am being groomed for chief executive or
chairman is ridiculous', he says in an interview with the Financial Times.
As a director with special responsibilities for Europe his office, in the
group's London headquarters in Grosvenor Place, is strategically placed on
the sixth floor between his father's and that of Mr Derek Bonham, chief
executive.
'Life may not always be fair and other executives here may feel they should
be on the board. But Mr Bonham wanted me on the board which approved my
appointment. There will be no dynasty here because Hanson is a meritocracy.'
Yet the possibility that the company could become a Hanson dynasty has upset
some managers. A former executive said one of his nightmares was that he
would come in one day to find Mr Hanson his boss. 'I did not go into
business to serve a family,' he said.
Mr Hanson always thought he might go into the family business, but by that
he means Hanson Transport, the privately-owned transportation company in
Huddersfield, and not the publicly-quoted Hanson.
Indeed, he always assumed that he would never work for Hanson. When he
joined NM Rothschild in 1983 Sir Evelyn de Rothschild asked him how he
wanted to be treated at the merchant bank. Did he regard merchant banking as
his career or was he about to leave after a year or two to join his father's
company?
Mr Hanson made it clear that he thought it unlikely that he would ever join
Hanson. 'If it was a small company it would be easy to join but it had
become more daunting to join as it grew bigger.'
If Sir Evelyn believed him most of his colleagues at work did not. A
contemporary at Rothschild says: 'No one ever doubted that he would
eventually join his father. I think that explained his extraordinary
confidence.'
After a spell in Hong Kong and then in Chile, he was posted to Spain to
establish a fund management business. In early 1990, nine months after
running the new venture, he received a call from his father to join Hanson.
'I immediately wanted to know what my prospects would be at Hanson. I knew
both my father and Gordon (Lord White) were going to retire by the end of
1997. I had to think very carefully about whether I wanted to move.
'My father told me I could make of the job what I wanted. If I did well I
could get on the fast track.'
In May he joined as an associate director.
Mr Hanson says his father's relationship with him at work is no different
from that Lord Hanson has with any other executive. He admits to being more
adept, though, at avoiding Lord Hanson's legendary short fuse. 'But if I
screw up he will let off at me like anyone else.'
Over the last two years Mr Hanson has worked on acquisitions with Mr
Christopher Collins, who is married to a niece of Lord Hanson's. He was
closely involved in the possible bids for PowerGen, the electricity
generator, and Canary Wharf, the troubled property development, and helped
draw up the plan to take a 2.8 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical
Industries.
All three targetted companies were politically sensitive and appeared to
consume a lot of the conglomerate's time. Mr Hanson believes it was time
well spent.
'We looked at them because of the economic and financial possibilities.
Frankly, I do not give a damn about the politics. Other people here can look
after that. They were also a smokescreen. While the press concentrated on
these big deals we were also looking at hundreds of other deals in private.'
Mr Hanson believes that the next big deal will be in Europe. Lord White, who
remains in charge of acquisitions, bemoans the fact that big undervalued and
poorly managed companies no longer exist.
'I believe they do exist', says Mr Hanson. 'They are in Europe. One of my
responsibilities is to look at the Continent more seriously. We have
traditionally been nervous about buying companies on the Continent.
'Yet there are many undervalued and poorly managed conglomerates on the
Continent. We have already looked at a number of different European
companies. It is only a matter of time before we buy a big European group.'
To take advantage of the opportunities of his new directorship Mr Hanson is
aware that he has to play down the playboy image. 'I think things have
changed since the fifties when it was cool to be seen out with film stars'.
His father was famous for being in the company of such people, but in the
nineties 'glamour does not mix with seriousness', he says.
At Eton and St Peter's College, Oxford, Mr Hanson's taste for the fast life
was well known, not least for his involvement in the notoriously riotous
Assassins dining club and the Bullingdon - whose members were once
photographed in the tabloids making Nazi salutes after a riotous dinner. Mr
Hanson was not a member at the time.
His involvement in such clubs proved a salutary lesson. 'I learnt to me more
careful and I know the power of the press.'
As a bachelor, he has his own polo team, the Bulldogs, and spends weekends
at his Berkshire home. Friends still talk of his thirtieth birthday party
which turned out to be an all-weekend affair for those staying with him. The
tabloids hailed it as the 'bash of the decade'.
With 3.7m Hanson shares - worth Pounds 7.7m at yesterday's closing price -
Mr Hanson points out that he has every incentive to make a success of his
new job. 'With 90 per cent of my wealth in one basket it is important to
have as much say as possible. I sleep better at night because I work here.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring helps Adwest rise to Pounds
7.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESTRUCTURING appears to be paying off at Adwest, the engineering, property
and power systems company, which yesterday announced a 6 per cent rise in
annual pre-tax profits to Pounds 7.53m.
Mr Fred Grant, chairman, said that failing the long promised economic
recovery, 'any success we have been able to achieve has been largely of our
own making.' He remained cautious about the current year, despite a good
first quarter. 'We are running the business on a very short rein   . but we
can still see soft spots in the economy.' Operating profits for the year to
June 30 increased by 12 per cent to Pounds 10.1m on sales just 4 per cent
ahead at Pounds 127m.
A significant turnround in the power systems division, which includes the
previously loss-making defence business, was partly behind the increase.
Power systems had contributed slightly more than one-third of operating
profits, against about a quarter last time. Defence acounted for about
Pounds 20m of total sales.
The automotive division, which supplies components to Land Rover, Jaguar,
and Peugeot, had increased margins despite a Pounds 1m loss in the power
steering business.
Mr Graham Menzies, managing director, said he was reasonably confident that
the power steering operation would be profitable in the current year,
following the closure of a factory and increased sales to Japanese
manufacturers such as Nissan.
Property profits were down by Pounds 1m to about Pounds 4m. The decline was
due to the absence of exceptional dealing profits which came to Pounds 1.25m
in 1991.
Mr Grant said the company had sold 186 houses in its joint venture with
Bryant, compared with 146 last time. However, a move towards smaller houses
meant the average price fell from Pounds 84,000 to Pounds 79,000. Margins
had also declined.
The rent roll on the group's investment properties had been increased from
Pounds 2m last year to Pounds 2.5m.
After two years of restructuring, Adwest had cut costs as far as possible,
Mr Grant said. About 800 jobs had been eliminated in the past two years,
bringing the total to 2,485. The emphasis now would be on increasing
productivity.
The company was confident that it could increase sales per employee from
Pounds 51,500 to Pounds 55,000 in the current year.
Earnings per share were 0.4p higher at 8.6p and the final dividend was
maintained at 5.75p for a total of 7p. The shares rose 7p to close at 120p.

on turnover improved from Pounds 30.7m to Pounds 33.6m, an increase of 9.2
per cent. Earnings per share came out at 2p (2.1p) after a higher tax charge
and minority interests.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.7p.
The company is proposing to change its name to Martin International

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A drop in pre-tax profits from Pounds 255,000 to Pounds 193,000 was
announced by Rea Holdings, the plantation company, for the six months ended
June 30.
Turnover declined from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 39.9m.
Mr Richard Robinow, the chairman, said that while crops were encouraging,
tea prices continued at levels just insufficient to achieve a break-even
position in the Bangladesh operation. Plantations reported a loss of Pounds
36,000 (Pounds 22,000 profit) for the period.
Product merchanting increased to Pounds 169,000 (Pounds 111,000) but margins
had been under pressure, while storage, which advanced to Pounds 191,000
(Pounds 176,000), had a high occupancy level, he said.
Earnings fell to 0.1p (0.5p) per share.

Lower selling prices in Dolphin Packaging's markets, which reflected
reductions in the costs of polymers and increased competition, led to a 45

half year to June 30.
The company, which produces plastic packaging, primarily for the food
industry, saw turnover fall from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds 12.3m. The interim
dividend is being held at 1.7p, payable from earnings per share of 2.39p

FT  03 OCT 92 / Choice of unknown minister stuns Brazil: Interim president's
first actions send shock waves through financial markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRASLIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Itamar Franco took office as interim president of Brazil yesterday
announcing a 90-day emergency plan to combat inflation and naming a finance
minister whose appointment sent shock waves through the financial markets.
The surprise choice of Mr Gustavo Krause, a little known congressman from
Brazil's north-east, to run the world's ninth largest economy left
businessmen and traders in the financial centre of Sao Paulo apoplectic and
put paid to the euphoria caused by Tuesday's congressional vote to impeach
President Fernando Collor.
The main Sao Paulo index closed 7.9 per cent down on the news.
'In a crisis like this, to name someone so mediocre is irresponsible to say
the least,' said Mr Roger Wright from Banco Garantia. 'Frankly speaking, it
could not be worse.'
Mr Krause's profile differs radically from that of his respected predecessor
Mr Marclio Marques Moreira. A banker and former ambassador to the US, Mr
Moreira won acclaim for bringing some stability to the economy and returning
Brazil to the international financial community by securing accords with the
International Monetary Fund, the Paris Club and creditor banks over its
Dollars 44bn (Pounds 24.7bn) commercial debt.
Mr Krause is a lawyer and politician from the Liberal Front (PFL) whose only
experience is as mayor of Recife, the capital of Pernambuco, and state
finance secretary.
'The charitable interpretation is that he's more of a political figure
who'll employ competent technicians,' said Mr Robert Barclay, head of Baring
securities in Brazil.
Mr Franco had been widely expected to name a well-known businessman or
politician from the south of Brazil, where the country's wealth is
concentrated. However, the leaders of the wide coalition of parties
supporting him could not agree on a name and after two days of bickering
finally left the choice to Mr Franco.
Mr Krause faces the immediate tasks of tackling inflation, which this week
hit 25 per cent a month, and renegotiating an agreement with the IMF, a task
made harder by his complete anonymity outside Brazil. Brazil has
consistently failed to meet targets of the accord signed in January and a
new accord is essential for the completion of a full agreement over its
commercial debt.
He will share the Economy Ministry with Mr Paulo Haddad, the new planning
minister. Mr Haddad is an economist from Mr Franco's home state of Minas
Gerais.
Yesterday Mr Haddad unveiled a 15-point, 90-day plan to combat inflation and
restart economic growth. Guaranteeing there would be no shock plan or price
freeze, he called for fiscal reform and a social pact. He dashed business
hopes of a reduction in interest rates from current levels of 33 per cent a
month, saying this would be 'extremely dangerous while inflation is so
high'. Instead he hopes to negotiate a reduction in interest rates and an
increase in government investment in return for commitments to maintain jobs
and stabilise prices.
The negative reaction to the new economics team is an unfortunate start for
Mr Franco, who assumed office yesterday, promising no corruption in his
government.
Earlie,r in a tense ceremony, his disgraced predecessor was presented with
senate papers stripping him of his powers and half a tonne of documents
implicating him in corruption. Mr Collor's signature of receipt brought a
tragic end to the career of the man who took office amid so much hope 30
months ago, as Brazil's first elected president for 30 years.
Booed as he left the presidential palace in the public elevator, Mr Collor
now has 20 days to present his defence before the senate which will judge
him on crimes of responsibility within the next 180 days. Theoretically Mr
Collor could return if found innocent but the prospect is unlikely.

FT  03 OCT 92 / So far so good in Angolan election: International
supervision has created a climate of reconciliation which will now be put to
the test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Jose Eduardo Dos Santos was still narrowly leading his opponent,
Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of the rebel Unita movement, as counting continued
last night in Angola's first free elections.
The war-shattered country is in the midst of a 16-month historic transition
from civil war to peace and democracy. The critical moment comes in the next
48 hours, when one of the warring sides must accept defeat.
International observers, who are satisfied the polling was free and fair,
say the success of the transition has left little room for either side to
manoeuvre.
Observers yesterday poured praise on the civic responsibility, tolerance and
self-restraint exercised by Angolans during polling, and on the
professionalism of the National Electoral Commission. But the international
community also deserves credit for helping to fund the process and create a
climate of confidence and national reconciliation in a society deeply
scarred by civil war.
The international role in Angola's peace process, costing about Dollars 250m
(Pounds 140m), is certain to provide lessons for transitions in other
war-ravaged African countries such as Mozambique, where talks on a ceasefire
agreement were continuing in Rome yesterday.
Even six months ago few observers believed the process could stay on track
and get as far as the elections. The formidable obstacles included deep
suspicion and hostility between the MPLA government and Unita, the many
weapons in the country, and the logistical constraints of working in a
country the size of France, Spain and Germany combined, which has never
before held elections and where the infrastructure is in ruins.
The critical input by the United Nations and the international community has
been to create confidence for both sides and for the people of Angola and to
provide an impartial and objective authority to resolve disputes.
'At some time we've been accused of being pro-MPLA by Unita and pro-Unita by
the MPLA, so we must have been getting it right,' says Miss Margaret Anstee,
the special representative of the UN secretary general and the head of the
Dollars 120m UN operation known as Unavem II.
'The process has stayed on track despite several violent incidents which
could have blown up.'
Critics have said the UN operation was vastly underfunded and
under-resourced, especially compared to the transition in Namibia. But Miss
Anstee says the UN mandate in Namibia was to organise and control the peace
process and elections, whereas in Angola the mandate was merely to observe
the process being undertaken by both sides.
The greatest problem has been logistics such as air transport, vehicles and
communications. 'Anstee pushed very hard and very successfully from the
beginning for bilateral support for logistics and it is hard to see how
things would have gone any better with more money,' said a western diplomat.
The UN-monitored peace process has had two basic elements - political and
military. On the political front, the voter registration campaign was
successful, registering 4.86m voters out of a population of about 10.5m.
Although an estimated 300,000-400,000 voters were not registered, observers
agree the exercise exceeded expectations.
The second vital part of the peace process was observing the elections
themselves.
The UN provided 400 observers and assisted in an internationally-funded
Dollars 10m airlift operation which flew 25,000 people in 320 flights from
remote areas to polling stations.
On the military side, 350 UN military observers have monitored the ceasefire
and supervised the confinement of troops to assembly areas, the collection
and disposal of weapons and the demobilisation of 150,000 troops, which was
supposed to be completed before the elections. Demobilisation went much
slower than expected, with only about two thirds of the 150,000 ex-soldiers
demobilised so far. Part of the problem has been that both sides, but
especially Unita, have kept back troops and the best weapons as an insurance
policy in case the process was derailed.
The second strand of the military process has been forging a new
50,000-strong unified army, navy and air force out of Unita and the MPLA.
This is being assisted by Britain, Portugal and France. Last Monday, the new
joint military high command of the new army was sworn in at a ceremony in
Luanda and at least 8,800 troops have undergone western-supervised training
courses in new military academies.
The British have spent Pounds 1.7m on practical support such as mine
clearance, signals equipment, refurbishment of a barracks at Uige and
technical advice on logistics, maintenance and restructuring the Ministry of
Defence.
Both the demobilisation and the formation of a new army have fallen short of
the ambitious targets set in the peace accords, but almost all observers say
what has been achieved, given the logistical and political constraints, has
been remarkable.
The risks of the process falling apart now rest on the reaction of both
parties to the election result within the next two days. But the success of
the efforts of the international community in getting this far has
contributed to providing Angola with a climate for reconciliation.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Japan sees record trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN recorded a current account surplus of Dollars 7.1bn (Pounds 4bn) in
August, up 28.2 per cent on the previous August and the largest surplus ever
recorded for the month.
The surplus this year to August is Dollars 73.1bn, a rise of nearly 85 per
cent against the same period last year.
The rise in the surplus, combined with the stagnation of the domestic
economy, is likely to intensify political infighting among the economic
bureaucracy, industry and politicians over economic policy.
The Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Japan will use the figures to
support their argument that the yen should appreciate gradually against the
US dollar to choke off the surplus.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, vice minister for international affairs at the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry said a rate of Y118 to the
dollar was appropriate, given the size of the surplus and Japan's low
inflation record. The dollar closed in Tokyo slightly weaker at Y119.40.
However the chorus of industrialists who complain that a stronger yen
stifles export growth will use figures showing a marked deterioration in the
labour market to justify their call for intervention to restrain the yen.
The labour market figures show there are only just enough jobs being created
to satisfy demand from people looking for work.
Although the unemployment rate did not rise in August from July's 2.2 per
cent, the introduction of recruitment freezes in most companies will push up
unemployment in the months to come.
The pressure for further government action to stimulate the economy, in
addition to the Y10,700bn emergency package already announced, is focusing
on calls for income tax cuts.
But Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, yesterday rejected calls from
some in the ruling Liberal Democratic party for tax cuts next year to be
financed by a rise in consumption taxes.
The sharp rise in the current account surplus from August last year was
largely due to a 15.2 per cent increase in the trade balance to Dollars
9.5bn last month compared with the same month in 1991.
This was a reflection of depressed demand for imports, which rose by only
0.4 per cent to Dollars 16bn and a rise in the value of exports.
Export volumes fell by 3.5 per cent. But the strength of the yen against the
dollar, which was 7.9 per cent down on its value in August last year, pushed
up export prices to produce a 5.4 per cent rise to Dollars 25.5bn.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Plenty of free lunches in Kuwait campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUWAIT CITY, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTIONS are an inflationary business in Kuwait. For one thing, the cost of
buying a vote has rocketed since the last poll in 1985 - and the price of
sheep has doubled.
No one admits to buying votes or to having been bought, of course. But
equally, everyone believes that it happens, if on a small scale. By common
reckoning the going rate today is anything up to KD3,000 (Pounds 6,000) a
vote, against a modest KD300 for the last elections.
In Kuwait, there are just 25 constituencies, 50 seats in the National
Assembly and only 81,400 voters. Whatever the truth to vote-buying
accusations, it is clear that a lot of money could go a long way towards
securing a candidate's election.
Most constituencies average only around 2,000-3,000 voters and the smallest,
on the country's southern border, has just 896, along with five candidates
and, doubtless, a delighted returning officer.
But small constituencies do not, in Kuwait at least, make for cheap
campaigns. By one western embassy's calculation the average candidate has
spent around KD160,000 on his campaign, and some probably spend much more
than that, though a straw poll puts the average expenditure at nearer
KD50,000. For comparison, British candidates are allowed to spend Pounds
4,330 plus up to 4.9p per voter.
Kuwait has no election rules limiting spending or sources of funds and most
candidates finance themselves. Except, allege opposition groups, some
pro-government candidates. 'Strange things happen,' says Mr Abdulla Nibari,
leader of the Kuwait Democratic Forum (KDF), a liberal opposition group.
'Some candidates who are known to have no wealth of their own - their
expenditure is surprisingly extravagant.'
But then Mr Nibari's group is campaigning on political idealism and a
shoestring. He reckons the cost of running the KDF's nine candidates will be
no more than KD50,000, with volunteers pitching in their time, spare
telephones, portable cabins and anything else which will help.
For most candidates the money goes on buying newspaper advertisements,
erecting placards which line the streets in Kuwait City, hiring staff and
setting up Bedouin-style tents which candidates use as campaign
headquarters.
Which is where the price of sheep comes in.
Most campaign tents offer refreshment. At a modest KDF tent in the Jabria
constituency, Mr Mohammed al Fadil, the campaign manager, says they can run
only to felafel and soft drinks. 'We're a bit tired of felafel after three
weeks.'
Less than 100 metres up the road, however, a rival candidate, Mr Ali Omar,
offers in the shade of a 60-metre-long tent a 60-metre-long buffet.
Waistcoated waiters - some of Mr Omar's 300 campaign staff, a number
equivalent to 10 per cent of his constituency's electorate - preside over
tables of steaming lamb and rice dishes. From a separate mini-marquee,
waiters bustle back and forth bearing trays of orange and grapefruit juice,
Pepsi and tea.
The bigger campaigns, and Mr Omar's is not the biggest, serve hundreds of
meals every night to thousands of voters who gather to chew over the issues.
And at Kuwait's main livestock market at Shuwaikh, traders are delighted.
'Business is profitable,' explained one dealer who yesterday shifted 100
Syrian sheep at a mark-up he put at 100 per cent. Over the three weeks of
the campaign, the price of an average sheep has risen from KD25-35 to
upwards of KD60.
The Commercial Bank of Kuwait has won a US lawsuit against Iraq's two main
banks, charging they defaulted on Dollars 1bn of loans after the 1990
invasion, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
The Kuwaiti bank sought Dollars 60m plus interest from the Central Bank of
Iraq and from Rafidain Bank, a state-owned commercial bank. It was part of
several loan syndicates that loaned more than Dollars 1bn to Iraq between
1983 and 1988. Iraq stopped making repayments in 1990.
The lawsuits raise the delicate issue of what the Bush administration plans
to do with Iraqi assets frozen in the US.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Democrats hold their breath as Perot returns to the fray
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JUST one month away from the US presidential election, the campaign had
settled into a pattern that appeared to open the way for Governor Bill
Clinton, the Democratic challenger, to build state by state on his lead over
President George Bush, the Republican incumbent.
The return of Mr Ross Perot to the race, together with the emergence of an
agreement on when and where to hold televised debates between the
candidates, offered at least the prospect of something to break the pattern.
Many Democrats are still holding their breath, remembering their party's
astonishing capacity for losing presidential elections. Yet the dynamics of
the race have been moving inexorably in Mr Clinton's favour, and the
Republicans are fervently praying that the uncertainty created by Mr Perot
and by the debates could shift the odds Mr Bush's way.
Realistically, neither Mr Perot's announcement on Thursday that he would
re-enter the campaign he quit in July, nor the proposed three debates to be
held between October 11 and October 19, has more than an outside chance of
significantly altering the outcome of the November 3 election.
Mr Perot has come a long way from the heady days of early summer, when
opinion polls showed him leading both President Bush and Governor Clinton.
Today, according to a CNN-USA Today poll, the Texas billionaire would score
only 7 per cent in the election, compared with 35 per cent for Mr Bush and
52 per cent for Mr Clinton.
Perhaps more significantly, 72 per cent of those questioned in the poll said
there was no chance they would vote for Mr Perot. The results were scarcely
more encouraging for the president, however, for 48 per cent said there was
no chance they would vote for him, while only 32 ruled out voting for his
Democratic rival.
As for the debates, only that between Kennedy and Nixon in 1960 is widely
credited with making much difference; even then, however, Kennedy merely
cemented an existing lead in the opinion polls.
Mr Perot, who has bought half-hour national television advertisements next
week, seems likely to join the debates, and his twanging one-liners could
well draw the limelight away from the two main candidates.
Nevertheless, it would take a substantial blunder during the debates by Mr
Clinton for them to have much impact on the result of the election on their
own.
Even with Mr Perot in the race, Mr Clinton has rock-solid leads in 16
states, including California, New York and Illinois, which carry great
weight in the electoral college; President Bush, on the other hand, can
count only on Indiana and Utah.
With time fast running out, Mr Clinton can, therefore, concentrate on good
prospects such as Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania, and even keep Mr Bush on
the defensive with forays into once firmly Republican states such as Texas
and Florida.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID GIBBONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, After the recent pointless speculative run on the franc, can there
really be any doubt that the markets are not capable of rational judgment?
It is one thing to topple the currency of the UK, deep in recession and with
a decimated industrial base, but quite another to turn on the franc. France
boasts a healthy set of fundamentals.
Against the spirit of the ERM it may be, but one is tempted to applaud the
Spanish central bank's decision to limit currency movements in order to end
speculation. Perhaps in this way European monetary policy can be determined
by rational beings, rather than by a mob of barrow boys.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Why small is no longer beautiful: Recession is wreaking
havoc on entrepreneurs who prospered in the 1980s
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is one thing for the government to re-draw the lines of economic policy;
quite another to restrain the inexorable rise in the immediate costs of the
recession. This week it emerged that the rate of business failures in
Britain had accelerated sharply in the third quarter, with a jump of more
than 50 per cent over the comparable period last year. The pain has been
particularly acute in the small business sector, where a new generation of
entrepreneurs that prospered in the boom of the 1980s is being
systematically wiped out. It is a tragedy not only for them, but for the
wider economy.
A striking feature of the labour markets of the developed world over the
past decade is the disproportionate contribution that small business has
made to the growth in employment. Britain and the US serve to illustrate the
point. Between 1985 and 1989, according to a study by Professor Colin
Gallagher of Newcastle University, more than 1m additional jobs were created
in the British economy by companies employing fewer than 20 people - twice
as many as those created by larger companies.
In the US the Bureau of Labour Statistics estimates that new companies
generated 12m jobs in the 1980s out of a total of 18.5m. The weakness of the
US economic recovery is largely explained by the collapse in the job
creating capability of small business: between 1990 and 1991 the additional
jobs created by new companies dropped from 1.5m to 144,000.
It is not difficult to see why small business should have been such a
conspicuous victim of the recession in the English-speaking economies. The
potent combination of loose monetary policy and financial deregulation in
the 1980s ensured a supply of plentiful, but increasingly expensive, credit.
In Britain rising house prices provided ballooning collateral for small
business loans.
Today in Britain house prices are down in nominal terms and real rates of
interest are still at their highest level since the 1930s. Unlike the early
1980s when an overvalued exchange rate was chiefly responsible for rising
unemployment, interest rates are now the key. Since a high proportion of
small businesses are in the non-tradeable sector of the economy, they
enjoyed a degree of protection in the earlier recession. Today they have
nowhere to hide.
Credit, whether cheap, as in the US, or expensive, as in Britain, is now
scarce. Small companies are not only vulnerable because of their greater
indebtedness; they are, as David Hale of Kemper Financial Services points
out, more dependent on a shell-shocked banking system than large companies
because they lack access to stock and bond markets and to commercial paper
markets. As banks seek to rebuild their capital and profits, small business
suffers disproportionately from the banks' urge to widen margins.
In the US the credit crunch has been exacerbated by bank failures and
conservative lending policies arising from new federal regulations that
severely penalise bank directors who adopt risky lending policies. Small
businesses there have also been hit by a sharp rise in health insurance
costs. And the heavy weighting towards the non-tradeable sector means that
they are less well placed to take advantage of a weak dollar than large
companies - a point that now applies with equal force to post-ERM Britain.
If the balance of advantage has shifted somewhat towards the larger
companies in economies that have seen significant devaluations, does this
mean that corporations will generate jobs in the 1990s on a scale to rival
the performance of small business in the 1980s? The answer may well hinge on
structural changes at work in the global labour market, the impact of which
can best be seen in the US.
Between 1979 and 1991 the level of employment in the Fortune 500 companies -
a reasonable proxy for big business - fell from 16.2m to just under 12m. As
a share of total (non-farm) employment that represents a spectacular fall
from 18 per cent to less than 11 per cent.
The most important factor behind the decline is the emergence in the 1970s
and 1980s of a global labour market. Business decisions about where to
produce mainstream industrial products came to be made increasingly on the
basis of global cost comparisons. In effect, the newly industrialising
countries were embarking on a process of wage equalization with the
developed world similar to the one that Europe embarked on with the US after
1945. Until the process of convergence in wages is complete, a tight cost
discipline is imposed on companies in the developed world. Labour markets
tend to polarise between skilled workers, who maintain or increase living
standards, and less skilled workers who see a decline in real wages.
This cost discipline has been reinforced by other micro-economic trends such
as the liberalisation of markets, technological innovation and the
development of Japanese-style 'lean' production methods. The results of this
explosive cocktail are reflected in the accompanying chart, extracted from
Prosperity or Decline, a thoughtful piece of futurology by Giles Keating and
Jonathan Wilmot of Credit Suisse First Boston (CSFB). The chart shows an
attempt by the rating agency Moody's to construct a long-run set of figures
to show the pattern of business defaults back to 1900.
The striking feature of the chart is the discontinuity in the decades that
followed the second world war. The end of the Bretton Woods era of fixed
exchange rates appears to have marked a shift to a less stable world in
which corporations felt unable to offer the same degree of job security. The
growth in self-employment and small business employment is, up to a point,
the obverse side of that coin.
In a world where corporations sub-contract more activity to turn as many
fixed costs as possible into variable costs, both the sub-contractors and
the corporations can be better off thanks to efficiency gains. But as CSFB's
Jonathan Wilmot points out, employment is less secure and the labour market
is subject to 19th century-style booms and busts.
If this thesis is correct the recent rise in the household savings ratio in
Britain is more than a temporary hangover after the 1980s debt party. It is
a longer-term structural change, reflecting the growing propensity of
nominal incomes to go down as well as up. And the trend will be
strengthened, as the fall of communism and the spread of liberal economics
propels more than 3bn people back into the global market for goods and
capital.
Against that background, falling interest rates will not do much to
stimulate new jobs. Fiscal policy will have to play a bigger part. Yet it
cannot do so in countries such as Britain and the US, which face the 1990s
from a position of budgetary weakness. The stimulus will have to come from
Japan and continental Europe; to some extent it is already doing so. The
structural, as well as short-term, factors thus suggest that the focus of
job creation may be in the tradeable goods sector in Britain and the US -
good for big business, but not such a favourable environment for job
creation.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: History of gas-powered vehicles rewards study
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr E S ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I noted with interest your article 'British Gas is to launch the first
serious attempt to put gas-powered vehicles on UK roads' (September 30).
That is not strictly correct, because during the war years an attempt was
made by Gas Power Conversions Ltd, a subsidiary of the United Kingdom Gas
Corporation, to convert commercial fleets, notably dairy and bakery
vehicles, to the use of town gas.
The on-vehicle gas was stored in bottles at a pressure of 3,000 psi and the
storage station gas stored at a pressure of 5,000 psi.
Although the vehicles ran smoothly, economically and successfully,
compression of the coal-based town gas created undue compressor maintenance
troubles.
In parallel with this work, the then Ministry of Fuel, Light &amp; Power had a
programme to convert all local authority vehicles to the use of methane
generated in sewage works digesters. That was based on work by (I believe)
Wandsworth Council engineers and the use of equipment developed by my
father, the then chief engineer of Gas Power Conversions Ltd.
After successful trials, the programme was abruptly stopped. The reason was
that Lord Leathers, in charge of war transport in 1945, had peacetime
connections with the petroleum industry. During the Conservative government
of 1951, he was in charge of the co-ordination of transport, fuel and power.
We were then technically in advance of Germany, where early work had been
done by Erren.
It has taken 50 years seriously to consider the benefits of gas-powered
vehicles. In the meantime other countries have not been so laggardly.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Lone Star state of mind: All eyes are on Texas as election
day nears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The coffee mug in Bill Hobby's office reads: 'Life's too short not to live
it as a Texan.' Election day is now a short 4 1/2 weeks away and the country
is destined to live it with Texans on its mind.
George Bush, by adoption, and Ross Perot, by birth, claim the Lone Star
state as home. The man who is likely to get the fourth highest number of
votes for the presidency, Andre Marrou, the Libertarian party candidate, was
born in south Texas. The invisible man, James Baker, who whispers into the
president's ear, is a Houston blue blood. Even the fifth man and still
favourite for the White House, Bill Clinton, was born just across its
border.
Texas could be excused, therefore, for thinking itself the centre of the
universe this year. Bill Hobby, its lieutenant governor for 14 years until
1990, will argue that the state is 'a kind of microcosm of the nation'.
Politically, the hypothesis holds water. Since the second world war, no
Democratic or Republican has become president without carrying Texas. Until
Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Democratic vice-presidential candidate, went down
to defeat four years ago, a Texan on the national ticket was a guarantee of
success.
This political year began with the widespread assumption that nothing could
prise Texas, the third most populous state in the nation, from the grip of
its adopted native son, George Bush. Severely depressed four years ago, its
economy, while not back to the glory days, looks better now. Its political
class, a strong progressive strain notwithstanding, seemed more
conservative. And there is no state where the appetite for 'down and dirty'
politics remains so keen.
Yet the president, with or without Ross Perot, is in trouble in Texas. He
might still win it, though the polls now have him fractionally behind. But,
the argument runs, if he cannot comfortably carry Texas, then all his
previous electoral base south of the Mason-Dixon line and west of the
Mississippi looks very fragile.
There are general and particular reasons for this frailty. Dave McNeely,
political columnist on the Austin Statesman-American, simply says that Mr
Bush 'has lost touch' with the concerns of ordinary people, here and
elsewhere. Bill Hobby says Mr Bush has 'no particular claim on Texans, but
then nor does anybody else'. Mr Clinton does not attract enormous empathy
either, but, as Jim Hightower, the former state agricultural commissioner,
puts it, 'you don't have to be in love to dance'.
The Texas contrast with 1988 is especially marked. Then a well-financed
Republican organisation, backed by an incumbent Republican governor in
Austin, the state capital, had Mr Michael Dukakis firmly in its sights by
midsummer. It had plenty of outside help, too. The National Rifle
Association had been blanketing east Texas for weeks with posters and bumper
stickers claiming that Mr Dukakis would take away the guns, AK-47s and
tactical nuclear weapons that many east Texans use to transfer whatever
flies or swims to the dinner table or trophy room.
Now, state patronage is in the hands of Ann Richards, the hard-nosed and
still popular Democratic governor and a featured speaker at both of the last
two Democratic conventions. Mrs Richards is not, according to those who know
her well, over-enamoured with Mr Clinton. But she pulls weight and,
according to Mr Hobby, 'at least Texans can pronounce Clinton's name'.
Texas has liberal voting and voter registration laws. Even the casual
observer is more aware of public attempts to get people registered here than
in any other state. According to Robert Stein, the Rice University pollster,
the Democratic effort is proving particularly effective among Hispanics in
Harris County, Houston, threatening to eat into Republican dominance of the
area.
Equally, the Republican campaign is not firing on all cylinders. There has
been internal dissension over who runs what, delays in setting up phone
banks; and money is said to be in short supply, to the point that the
Clinton headquarters, initially reticent about pouring funds into a Texas
dry well, is sending down more financial lubricant.
But then along comes Ross Perot again. It is hard to find a public Texan,
Democrat or Republican, who has a kind word to say about him. But observers
such as Robert Stein concede Mr Perot has a state base in the Dallas-Fort
Worth area, where he has been a large employer and which has a large
concentration of military and retired people, who seem to like him.
Tactically, both national campaigns have been recently hewing to the good
advice Governor Richards offered Mr Clinton some weeks ago about how best to
deal with Mr Perot - 'just don't get him mad'. This resulted in the dispatch
of delegations to his Dallas court on Monday, which the Republicans hoped
might cause Mr Perot to forget certain earlier denunciations, of which
'autocratic tycoon' and 'lunatic' were among the more polite.
The trouble is that Mr Perot is indeed plenty mad, as his statement on
Thursday demonstrated, and his temper will be made no sunnier by the fresh
torrent of accusations about his singular ways. The worst of these concern
his portrayal of his movement as 'bottoms up', whereas evidence grows that
it has been controlled tightly by the little man himself, including to the
extent of investigating his own 'volunteers' suspected of insufficient
loyalty or other trangressions.
On Thursday he put up the shutters and said he would answer no questions on
subjects unrelated to the real concerns of Americans, the definition of
which rests exclusively with himself and his volunteers. Curiously, it is a
defence that might work in the limited time before election day.
But the heavy odds are that Mr Perot cannot defy gravity and he knows it,
too. The alternative explanation, therefore, is that he is a calculating
businessman who is playing the political game for a profit, which can only
be derived from the perception that he helped somebody else win. So deep is
his presumed loathing of Mr Bush that all logic suggests he wants something
from Mr Clinton. Giving Mr Perot the benefit of the doubt that he believes
what he says, that means a commitment to budget cutting with a vengeance.
But that depends on him getting enough votes to make a difference. Ten per
cent in Texas - the ballpark estimate of the best he will do there  - may
tip the balance to either candidate. But if Mr Clinton, or even, much more
improbably, Mr Bush, feels that Texas is not necessary to win the White
House, then Mr Perot's leverage remains hypothetical.
But, as a gamble, it is something that Texans, accustomed to drilling holes
in the ground, understand. To turn around Bill Hobby's coffee mug, 'some
Texans are too short not to make life interesting'.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: Nationalist answers evade 'green' global problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELAINE CRUIKSHANKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is surprising to hear Colin Hines, a Greenpeace activist, proposing
purely national solutions to global and environmental problems ('The green
view on subsidiarity', September 16).
As the problems of Franco-German disputes over waste movements show,
nationalist solutions shove the problem into somebody else's back yard. A
practical subsidiarity would incorporate strong European guidelines with
flexibility for national implementation.
Only in this way can the European Community avoid the mistakes of the US.
There, a multiplicity of state regulations has distorted the market and
rendered entrepreneurial waste management practice uneconomical. The
Franco-German example shows that trade and good environmental practice must
go hand in hand. Subsidiarity on environmental issues means strong EC
guidelines adaptable to local circumstances, not fresh trade barriers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HELMUT SCHMIDT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I read your editorial (October 1) with great interest and in complete
agreement.
It is entitled 'The pressures on Mr Kohl', but implicitly it also leads the
reader to understand the hidden but compelling reasons for the recent
currency turmoils. Yours is a voice of reason.
I deeply regret the superfluous verbal exchanges between ministers in London
and in Bonn, as well as between the spokesmen of the two central banks.
If both sides had obeyed the rules of the European Monetary System, as they
had been devised by Giscard d'Estaing and myself more than a decade ago,
namely by a timely and adequate realignment of exchange rates, the turmoil
and also the squabbling would not have occurred.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Letter: Major eschewed a safety net
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALFRED DOLL-STEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The blizzard of criticism of John Major over sterling misses one
important point. Mr Major knew he could have defended the currency by
raising interest rates, either by two or three points, when the pound first
started to come under pressure, or by swingeing amounts at the last moment
(as Sweden and Eire did).
Not only did he choose not to inflict this burden on the economy; without
the benefit of this safety net he deliberately raised his own profile in the
psychological war against the speculators. He could hardly have been unaware
that his credibility and standing would suffer even more damage if his
tactic failed. Should we not admire this?

Sir, Mr Apsion's palindromes (Letters, September 26) result from the
illogical way dates are usually written: day/month/year. His American
friends, who use an even less sensible method (month/day/year), will
encounter the first of their remaining seven 5-figure palindrome dates of
the millennium on March 3 1993 and the rest at 13-month intervals,
celebrating jointly with him on September 9 1999. The logical format is:
year/month/day. Papers so marked may be arranged chronologically by sorting

FT  03 OCT 92 / Survival of the fittest: Ways to weather the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ray Neale has a nice little business making steel structures for the
building industry in Portslade on the Sussex coast. Westwing Engineering
employs seven people and has annual sales of just over Pounds 200,000.
The bad news is that two years ago Mr Neale was running an even bigger
business, R Neale &amp; Co, with twice as many employees and four times the
turnover. But some of his customers could not pay and others would not pay,
so the company collapsed.
R Neale made its own small contribution to the statistics which chart the
swelling flood of bankruptcies. More than 46,000 businesses, mostly small,
failed in the first nine months of this year, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
the business information group.
One of the principal causes has been customers failing to pay their bills.
'It was mainly bad debts,' says Mr Neale. 'The banks tell you to do a credit
check on your customers but that doesn't mean a thing. Sometimes even your
big customers go down while others tell you that they are not satisfied with
the work you have done and hold back payment.'
For a time it looked as though Mr Neale, 48, and with more than 30 years in
the steel business, would have to sell his home to pay off debts of more
than Pounds 70,000. But he managed to remortgage the house and start up in
business again.
He is determined that things will be different this time. 'I am very uptight
about everything I do now,' he says. 'I chase people right down to the last
penny.'
Ray Neale has survived to fight another day. He has even taken over a
smaller welding company which itself went under with debts of just over
Pounds 6,000. But the increased rate of failure of well-established small
businesses is causing concern.
'We are not dealing with businesses which have been reckless,' says Mr David
Swaden, a partner in insolvency specialists Leonard Curtis &amp; Co. 'What is
worrying is that we are down to bedrock, family businesses which have used
up their reserves and their energy fighting the recession.'
It is often the smaller businesses, many of them set up during Mrs
Thatcher's enterprise revival of the 1980s, which are the most vulnerable.
Small companies may be more flexible than large corporations but they often
lack the management expertise, the financial resources and the broad
customer base which can help larger competitors ride out the recession.
Numerous studies have pointed to a shortage of capital and related financial
problems such as excessive dependence on borrowings, poor financial
management and the high level of interest rates as the main reasons for
businesses failing.
Even well-managed businesses can be undone by events beyond their control.
But a recent survey by the Manchester Business School revealed, to the
researchers' surprise, that business owners did not blame outside events for
the failure of their venture but accepted their own limitations as managers.
If the problems are within the control of the managers themselves what
should companies do to survive the recession and stay out of the clutches of
the insolvency profession? Experience suggests the following should be given
priority:
Realistic business planning. 'Too many businesses set their plans on the
assumption that nothing will go wrong,' says Mr Swaden. Even in the best of
times you must build room into your business plan to allow for setbacks. In
a recession this becomes even more necessary.
Accurate and timely financial information. 'Companies frequently do not have
efficient accounting systems so they do not know where losses are being
made,' says Mr Mike Wheeler, a turnround specialist at accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick. 'We go into some companies, even listed companies, and find there
is financial chaos.'
Tight control of cash flow. Companies often do not understand the difference
between cash flow, which is money in the hand to pay the wages, and profits,
which are a book-keeping entry arrived after applying the relevant
accounting conventions. Mr Lance Blackstone of accountants Blackstone Franks
advises managers to review every stage in the production and sales cycle to
see if can be shortened or reorganised to free more cash.
Credit control. Put your credit policy down in writing and make someone
responsible for enforcing it. Take credit references on all new customers
and update them regularly. When dealing with new or risky customers you
should protect your position by asking for personal guarantees, taking out
credit insurance or by making partial shipment against part-payment. Do not
allow long credit periods and chase up slow payers promptly but firmly.
Keep on good terms with the bank manager. He should be given all the
relevant data he needs. If anything goes wrong he should not be kept in the
dark but you must have ready a plan to put things right. Check the terms and
renewal dates of bank facilities and plan ahead for renewal meeting.
Keep good stock controls. Boxes of unsold product gathering dust have to be
financed and take up costly space. Computerised stock control systems are
available but you can achieve a lot by walking round the warehouse to
identify slow-moving items. Do not be afraid to discount, sharply if
necessary, to move obsolete stock.
Try to broaden your customer base. A range of customers means that it need
not be the end if one large customer goes down.
If financial problems are looming, act fast. It is easier to renegotiate a
loan agreement with the bank manager or sell an unprofitable part of the
business if your negotiating partner believes he is dealing with a sound
business. If your difficulties are only too obvious your negotiating hand
will be weakened.
Many of the businesses which fail, particularly those with attractive
products or a lucrative market niche, live on in some form - often under new
ownership and with a reduced workforce. But this is little consolation to
the original owners who may have lost their homes and livelihood.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Investors flounder as sterling floats: How far the pound
might fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MANY backbench Conservatives, the government's decision to float the
pound on the foreign exchanges was the best thing that could have happened
to Britain's economic policy.
For corporate treasurers and currency investors, though, a free-floating
pound has made life much more difficult.
For the past two years, they have assumed that the pound could go no lower
than DM2.7780, its lower limit against the D-Mark in the European Exchange
Rate Mechanism. But yesterday it reached a historic low of DM2.4260.
While the currency fell sharply on the foreign exchanges, investors were at
a loss to know when sterling would bottom out.
On a trade-weighted basis, the pound is undervalued against the D-Mark, with
a fair value being seen by some analyists at between DM2.50 and DM2.60.
However, Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking
Corporation in London, said: 'You can ignore such measures altogether. It is
no guide to where the currency will go right now.'
Instead, the pound is being undermined by uncertainty over the government's
economic policy and the continuing political difficulties over its European
policy.
In the next few days, sterling's moves will be dictated by whether there is
another cut in UK base rates. There is widespread speculation that Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, will announce another rate cut next week to boost
the government's lagging fortunes at its annual party conference.
A cut in rates, currently at 9 per cent, would give investors a lower return
on the pound and push its value down further. But Mr Austin said that
yesterday's 'disturbing' fall made another cut unlikely.
Beyond the party conference, choosing a bottom for sterling is a more
hazardous business.
Mr David Shaw, bonds director at Legal and General Investments, has worked
out several scenarios for sterling over the next few months.
The most likely, he says, is that there will be a 'managed float' of the
currency. That would involve a formal statement that the UK has left the
ERM, with the government anchoring the currency to a new exchange rate
regime or a mixture of monetary indicators. Sterling would, in his view,
fall to DM2.35 or Dollars 1.50.
The second most likely scenario, according to Mr Shaw, is that the
government will issue a formal statement that the UK will re-enter the ERM
when the time is right. That might accompany the cut in German short-term
rates as Germany slides into recession. The pound would re-enter the ERM at
a central parity of DM2.40 and at a value of Dollars 1.60 to the US dollar.
The most bearish outlook for the currency, however, would be a continuation
of uncertainty or a government policy of 'benign neglect' towards sterling,
similar to the one that has predominated in the US this year. It would be
accompanied by more cuts in interest rates in an attempt to 'go for growth'.
A leading London-based investment manager who specialises in currency
management said that a policy of benign neglect could push sterling down to
DM2.20. Mr Shaw believes the currency could bottom out as low as DM2.00.
At such levels, the pound would be clearly undervalued and a rebound would
certainly ensue.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Councils may form pool for self-insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG COUNCILS are examining the possible formation of a self-insurance pool
in the wake of the troubles experienced by Municipal Mutual, the insurance
company that insures the great majority of councils.
Accountants Touche Ross have been retained to advise on how councils could
combine forces to insure risks such as public and employers' liability for
which the insurance market is reluctant to provide cover.
Municipal Mutual, which is owned by its policyholders, ceased writing new
business and temporarily suspended payment of claims om Wednesday after
rescue talks with Paris-based La Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires broke
down.
A number of councils whose insurance policies came up for renewal this week
have experienced difficulty obtaining cover.
For example, Gwynedd County Council paid a substantially higher premium for
a temporary policy. 'In a full year, the council would have to find at least
Pounds 500,000 over and above the present budgetary provision to meet the
increased cost of premiums,' a council official said yesterday. The
council's annual budget is about Pounds 160m.
A number of insurers are also demanding that councils retain larger
excesses, keeping larger amounts of risk on their own books and reinforcing
the move towards self-insurance.
An increasing number of London boroughs already self-insure. Their control
of education gives them particularly large budgets - typically above Pounds
200m - allowing them to carry all but very large public liabilities.
Islington has had a borough insurance fund for 10 years and has
progressively shifted to self-insurance over the period. About 80 per cent
of its risk is now self-insured.
Concern is growing among Municipal Mutual's 2,000 staff that a scheme of
arrange-ment would entail job losses.
Many staff enjoy subsidised mortgages, paying 6 per cent interest on the
first Pounds 25,000 borrowed. Mr Tony Whiteley, national officer of the MSF
technicians' union, which represents 1,500 MMI staff, said: 'Workers could
not only lose their jobs and redundancy rights, but also their homes, which
are mortgaged to the MMI.'

FT  03 OCT 92 / Maktoum stable cut refuels racing debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS that the Maktoum family is considering reducing the number of horses
it owns in the UK does not herald the imminent collapse of horseracing in
Britain, according to industry experts.
But it has refuelled the continuing debate about the future of the UK's
sixth-largest industry as it grapples with recession and the conflicting
interests of some of the parties involved.
Mana Al Maktoum, the spokesman for the oil-rich Dubai family that owns 12
per cent of all bloodstock in training in the UK, said: 'As a policy, I
would say there will be a reduction of our horses in Britain . . . How much
of a reduction depends on the situation here.'
The Maktoum family is not alone in lobbying for increased prize money and
more generous tax incentives to help boost its return on investment in an
industry that has suffered in the economic downturn.
Mr David Pipe of the Jockey Club agreed that prize money in the UK was
'unacceptably low' and hinted that the bookmakers still remained partly to
blame for not putting enough money back into the sport.
He said the industry remained a long way from disaster. 'Attendances are not
bad and we are doing better than one would expect from a leisure industry in
the present circumstances.'
Ladbroke Racing, the UK's largest bookmaker, said that its profit margins on
racing were much smaller than its critics suggested and urged an end to
'squabbling' within the industry.
The bookmakers want greater consultation between all parties concerned and
'continued progress in the timing and quality of racing fixtures' to
increase revenue.
The Horseracing Advisory Council, which groups breeders and owners but not
bookmakers, says the government is failing in its commitment to provide a
VAT 'level playing field' for the UK breeding industry.
The industry stands to gain from a quarter of a percentage point cut in
betting duty announced in the last budget, but it is pressing the government
for further cuts in the duty and a reduced rate of VAT on bloodstock.
Buyers in Britain pay 17.5 per cent VAT, compared with 5.5 per cent in
France and 2.7 per cent in the Irish Republic.
Government officials have indicated that while such reductions are legally
available they are 'politically unacceptable'.
Mr Philip Potts, secretary of Tattersalls, the oldest and largest UK
bloodstock agency, warned yesterday that official reluctance to provide
further tax assistance may both hurt the industry and backfire on the
government.
'If the industry is reduced, then tax revenues will decline,' he said.

FT  03 OCT 92 / London expected to lag in growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREATDQ Kondon, hampered by sluggishness in financial and business services,
is forecast to be the UK's slowest growing region during the 1990s according
to the latest regional survey by the Northern Ireland Economic Research
Centre and Oxford Economic Forecasting.
The survey says growth will be fastest in the less urbanised regions
including the south, the east Midlands, Wales and Yorkshire and Humberside,
The north and north-west of England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are
expected to lag behind the UK average.
The report suggests that the economic boom in south-east England during the
1980s, which raised that region's share of national economic activity above
its postwar norm, was unsustainable.
By the end of next year it forecasts that employment in the south-east will
have fallen from its 1990 peak of 8.8m by 835,300, a fall 1 1/2 times
greater than the number of jobs gained from 1986 to 1990.
Employment in financial and business services in the south-east fell by
almost 5 per cent.
'Regional variations in the impact of the recession have turned the
north-south divide on its head,' the report says.

MR KEVIN MAXWELL is to continue his High Court challenge to have a judicial
review of the rights of the Serious Fraud Office not to disclose documents
to defendants before they are interviewed under its special section two
powers.
A High Court judge yesterday refused Mr Maxwell leave for such a review.
However, his solicitors said afterwards that he would renew his application
next week in front of two other judges.
Mr Maxwell, who faces eight charges of theft and conspiracy to defraud,
claimed that the SFO was failing in its obligations as a prosecutor and
acting unfairly by not allowing him to see documents before he was
interviewed under section two, which removes his right to remain silent.
Mr Maxwell was due to have his eighth section two interview next Monday.
That has now been postponed pending the result of next week's hearing.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Treasury to alter insider dealing law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY has conceded after strong criticism from the City that its
proposed new insider dealing law needs changing.
A draft of the proposed law, circulated to a small number of City
institutions in August, prompted complaints that legitimate activities would
be outlawed. There were also claims that the new law would make insider
dealing - dealing on unpublished, price-sensitive information - more
difficult to prosecute in some instances.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, Treasury economic secretary, said in a speech to the
Corporation of London, the local authority for the City, on Thursday: 'We
are in the process of considering the valuable comments we have received. I
am confident that the revised proposals which we are now preparing will
substantially address the legitimate points which people have put to us
about the draft legislation.' He gave no indications of the planned changes.
Mr Dorrell said the new law 'will not render the legitimate work of analysts
illegal, erect barriers to the normal conduct of investment business or stop
underwriting. However, I also want to make clear to you today that the
government is not in the business of leaving loopholes for the
unscrupulous.'
Mr Dorrell's comments were given a cautious welcome in the City. 'We
certainly take some comfort from them,' the British Merchant Banking and
Securities Houses Association said. The proposal that has drawn the most
complaints would extend the definition of 'inside information' to cover
anything that could affect a company's share price, regardless of whether
the information was about the company.
That could include, for instance, information about the company's rivals, or
about a large block of its shares that had been put up for sale in the stock
market. The activities of analysts, marketmakers and underwriters could all
be caught as a result.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Bank reserves down Pounds 4.4bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England's reserves fell by Pounds 4.4bn (Dollars 7.7bn) last
month, but analysts said that did not reflect the true extent of
intervention by the authorities as they attempted to prop up sterling.
Although the underlying fall was a record, it was only a fraction of the
Pounds 15bn of foreign currency reserves allegedly spent shortly before the
pound's devaluation.
Treasury figures show that Britain's overall gold and currency reserves were
Dollars 42.7bn at the end of September compared with Dollars 44.4bn at the
end of August.
The net final fall of Dollars 1.7bn was much smaller than the underlying
fall because the government was able to draw upon Dollars 6.1bn - about half
 -of the special borrowing of up to Ecu10bn of foreign currencies arranged
at the beginning of September to boost the pound. Overall reserves were also
boosted by Dollars 1.2bn of Ecu Treasury bill proceeds.
The Treasury said the changes in reserves were not an exact mirror of Bank
intervention. The figures are the only official indication of what took
place last month. They fail to reveal a number of factors, including:
How much intervention was carried out by the Bundesbank on behalf of the
Bank of England? Earlier this week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, president of the
Bundesbank, pointed out that total compulsory D-Mark sales in support of EMS
currencies during the week of 'Black Wednesday' came to more than DM44bn
(Pounds 17.6bn), 'the greater part of which was accounted for by
interventions vis-a-vis sterling'.
How much the Bank may have raised on the so-called forward market, where it
is possible to buy sterling a number of months ahead, and where deals do not
have to be settled until delivery falls due.
'The only conclusion you can draw from these figures is that either we all
got the scale of the intervention completely wrong, which seems unlikely, or
that more Bundesbank funds were used to try and prop up the currency than we
thought at the time,' said Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg
Securities.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Banks calls US findings on BCCI 'offensive'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England yesterday fiercely denied accusations by US senators
that it failed to regulate Bank of Credit and Commerce International
properly, condemning part of the criticism as 'misconceived and offensive'.
In an unusually strong public statement, the Bank made a detailed rebuttal
of charges in a Congressional inquiry led by Senator John Kerry (Democrat,
Massachusetts) which accused the Bank of 'wholly inadequate' regulation of
BCCI.
The Bank said it would not respond formally to an inquiry which it believed
had employed 'deficient procedures', but it wanted to deny 'a number of
allegations about the Bank for which there is no factual basis of any sort'.
Senator Kerry's office reacted to the Bank's statement by saying: 'Mr Kerry
stands by the report.'
The war of words between Congressional investigators and the Bank broke out
the day after the publication in Washington of the report of a four-year
inquiry by Senator Kerry and Senator Hank Brown (Republican, Colorado).
The report said the Bank had received evidence of BCCI fraud in the spring
of 1990, but had 'colluded in the suppression of the true facts' until the
spring of last year, when it co-ordinated the worldwide closure of BCCI.
However, the Bank said yesterday that to suggest it had been 'even
inadvertently a party to a cover-up of criminality is misconceived and
offensive'. It also denied entering any deal with the government of Abu
Dhabi not to close BCCI.
The Bank, which initially responded to the report by saying it could not
comment because it was awaiting the publication of the inquiry into BCCI
supervision by Lord Justice Bingham, was highly critical of the senators'
methods.
'The procedures under which this investigation operated were, in the Bank's
view, unjust and have led to allegations about the Bank which have no basis
in fact,' it said.
The Bank denied telling BCCI's auditors Price Waterhouse to certify BCCI's
accounts in 1989. The report said that Price Waterhouse would not have
certified the accounts unless it had been guided to do so by the Bank.
The Bank also disputed a central tenet of the Kerry report, that the
investigation by Mr Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney, had
triggered BCCI's closure. The Bank said it had acted independently of Mr
Morgenthau's investigation.
The Bank and Price Waterhouse insisted that neither had given evidence to -
or been interviewed for - the Kerry inquiry. Senator Kerry's office denied
Price Waterhouses claim that the committee had not responded to the firm's
offer to come and talk to it in London.
'We prepared a subpoena against Price Waterhouse of the UK asking that they
talk to us. But the US lawyers for Price Waterhouse told us point blank that
they wouldn't even accept the subpoena,' a senate staff member said.
Senator Brown said last night that the Bank had refused a request for access
to information concerning BCCI, which had been made through the Federal
Reserve Bank. He said the Bank had thrown a 'veil of secrecy' over its
actions.
The report's findings were based on public documents and represented 'what
we believe to be an objective analysis of their contents'.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Rivers face 'aesthetic test'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Rivers Authority has proposed that rivers, lakes and estuaries
should be assessed on their pleasant appearance and ability to support
aquatic life, as well as by the chemical tests used in the past.
The authority, which is responsible under the 1989 Water Act for setting
water quality standards in England and Wales, yesterday made its proposals
to the government, drawing on more than 160 responses to its December 1991
consultation paper.
It proposes that rivers and estuaries be classified by use: fisheries;
drinking water; agricultural or industrial supply; water sports; and nature
conservation. Surveys every five years would test the chemical, biological,
nutrient and aesthetic state of the water.
Dr Jan Pentreath, the authority's chief scientist, said: 'Water should be
improved locally on the basis of what it is to be used for. At the same
time, it is essential to have the national picture in order to assess value
for money.'
The authority's report follows rising concern about the increasing cost to
water companies of meeting new environmental regulation, and the effect on
customers' bills.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental pressure group, said it was
concerned that 'The government's fear over rising water bills will
compromise the implementation of the new statutory water quality
objectives'.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Labour leaders challenged in vote on defence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR conference defied the party leadership for the fourth successive
year yesterday by voting for deep cuts in defence expenditure.
The grassroots were more determined than ever, with 4.35m votes insisting
that a Labour government should cut UK defence expenditure to the average of
other western European countries.
Only 831,000 voted for the national executive's recommendation to throw out
the motion, confirming the strength of feeling against the Pounds 24bn
defence budget.
The rebellion will have little influence on the leadership, which has
consistently ignored similar resolutions in each year since 1989.
Mr Tony Clarke for the national executive committee argued that the
leadership was not hostile to the sentiments of the motion, but its vague
wording failed to identify how the average figure should be calculated.
Speakers including Ms Debra Gold, from Hampstead and Highgate, protested
that the leadership had 'hidden away and disowned' its peace and disarmament
policy.
More important, on Thursday the result of a card vote showed the extent of
resistance to any significant alteration to the union's block vote at party
conferences.
Delegates voted by a margin of four to one for a motion endorsing the
present relationship in spite of appeals from the leadership to leave the
ultimate decision to a working party which is due to report by Christmas.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Major decides to defy Euro-sceptics: A ruthless drive to
force Tory MPs into line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR has made his choice. This week he stepped in at last to the
policy vacuum left by the disintegration of his economic and European
policies on September 16.
The prime minister will defy the Tory Euro-sceptics by pressing ahead with
ratification of the Maastricht treaty. He will seek to ease the process by
keeping sterling indefinitely outside the European exchange rate mechanism.
The first priority is economic recovery rather than stable prices.
So a Conservative party that risked drifting into self-destruction has been
given the lead it demanded. Mr Major's dilemma is that a large and angry
segment of that party wanted to head in the opposite direction.
Next week's annual conference in Brighton will see the first bruising
skirmishes in a battle over Europe that threatens to engulf the government
until next spring. Mr Major believes he will win. He can be far less certain
of the cost the fight will inflict on a government whose authority has been
shredded by devaluation.
Nor will Maastricht be the last battle. The pro-European majority in his
cabinet is content for now to accept a formula that defers a decision on
sterling's return to the ERM for up to two years. They accept that Mr Major
cannot join battle with the Euro-sceptics on two fronts.
Unlike the chancellor, other heavyweights such as Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr
Michael Heseltine and Mr Kenneth Clarke have not been singing in their
baths. Mr Norman Lamont may feel liberated by the removal of an exchange
rate constraint. Many of his colleagues believe the economic and political
imperatives that led the government into the ERM have been suppressed rather
than removed.
So Mr Major is emphasising in private as well as public that he has
suspended rather than abandoned his view that sterling is better off inside
than outside the ERM.
As for the chancellor, Mr Lamont's peers believe he should be safe in the
Treasury for the time being. The view around the cabinet table is that the
prime minister cannot afford to move a self-declared champion of the
Euro-sceptics while the Maastricht bill is in the House of Commons. But few
expect Mr Lamont to remain in No 11 Downing Street much beyond next spring.
Mr Major's decision to press on with ratification of Maastricht came at
Thursday's cabinet meeting. It followed an intense round of contacts with
his European colleagues which had convinced him that he could no longer
prevaricate.
President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl signalled that they
would accommodate his political troubles by publicly eschewing any notion
that they intended to leave Britain in the slow lane of a two-speed Europe.
The quid pro quo they sought was tangible evidence that Britain would ratify
the treaty well before a second referendum in Denmark in the middle of next
year.
Mr Major's counterparts warned him that his agenda for the European
Community - completion of the single market; a drive to complete the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks; and commitments to EC enlargement -
would be swept aside unless he could deliver on the treaty.
Alongside those sticks was a carrot. They accepted Mr Major's judgment that
the sceptical mood among the electorates of the Community demanded a clear
response from the EC summit in Birmingham later this month.
The prime minister was given the go-ahead to draft a declaration committing
governments to put flesh on the concept of subsid-iarity - the devolution
from Brussels to national governments of intrusive powers.
There was agreement also that further declarations buttressing the
intergovernmental nature of much of the treaty would be needed to pave the
way for the Danish government to hold a second referendum.
Mr Major linked that assessment of the mood among his partners with a
broader judgment that the damage to Britain's standing would be damaged
beyond repair if he sought to renege on Maastricht.
He reminded the cabinet that he had extracted critical concessions in the
final hours of the treaty's negotiations last December. That would never
again be possible if the government did not keep its word. The prime
minister was careful to ensure that every member of the cabinet put his or
her name to the decision. There was a more fundamental point. In spite of
his strong antipathy to federalism, Mr Major remains persuaded that Britain
cannot prosper politically or economically on the margins of Europe.
For for all the heat generated in recent weeks by the Eurosceptics, he is
aware that the assessment is shared by a a comfortable majority in his party
at Westminster. As the then Mrs Margaret Thatcher discovered, there is no
future for a Conservative prime minister willing to admit that Britain has
joined Europe's second or third division.
Defeating the Euro-sceptics will not be easy. Party managers are promising a
ruthless campaign to force MPs into line. But the signs are that up to 50
Tories are ready to refuse their support and that many more will be have to
be coerced.
The prime minister will therefore be forced to rely on the opposition
parties to get the legislation through. Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, is
clear that he will not destroy his party's hard-won European credentials by
attempting to defeat the bill. But he will seek to maximise Mr Major's
discomfort in the protracted guerrilla warfare by Tory Euro-sceptics during
the committee stage of the bill.
It will be bloody and debilitating for his government. But in the end Mr
Major had no other choice.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Stance on opt-out schools hardens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS ANN TAYLOR, shadow education secretary, committed herself yesterday to a
much harder line on grant-maintained schools than her predecessor, Mr Jack
Straw.
Mr Straw had softened the party's opposition to the opting-out of schools
and had accepted that Labour might not be able to return them all to council
control.
During yesterday's education debate on the last day of Labour's conference
in Blackpool Mrs Taylor said: 'We oppose opt-out in principle because it is
wrong.'
'It is wrong in principle to set school against school. It is wrong in
principle to reintroduce selection by the back door.'
Other speakers pointed to the limited popularity of opting out. 'They have
spent millions bribing schools to opt out, but less than 1 per cent have
been tempted,' Ms Joanna Tait of the Socialist Education Association said.
Mrs Taylor said: 'There are more schools opting out in Tory Kent and Tory
Essex than in all Labour authorities put together. It is clear which
political party schools want to escape from.'
She led attacks on the government's white paper on education, Choice and
Diversity, published this summer. 'All it does is set the scene for more
chaos,' she said.
Strong support by the conference for the unification of Ireland set back the
hopes of a vociferous minority in the party who want Labour to organise in
Northern Ireland, Ralph Atkins writes. Labour has close ties with the
nationalist Social Democratic and Labour Party in the province.
The conference also called for a European dimension to talks on the
province's political future.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Red flags celebrate return to tradition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AFTER the glitz and electric guitar riffs that disconcerted shadow cabinet
members last year, Labour yesterday went back to its roots, with brass bands
and The Red Flag, the party anthem. Red flags were waved by an enthusiastic
crowd and Auld Lang Syne was sung twice.
The conference finale was not the only old-fashioned ingredient of
yesterday's proceedings. A podium speaker asserted that: 'Capitalism
contains within it the seeds of its own destruction.' There was a motion
calling for policies based on 'honest socialist principles'.
Mr John Evans, the conference chairman, felt moved to proclaim that he was
'as proud of my trade union heritage' as any Conservative was of his public
school. Even Mrs Margaret Beckett, the deputy leader, giving the day's
keynote speech in powder-puff pink, played to the traditional mood in
asserting 'how much the work done at local level matters'.
She denounced the government's lack of competence and honesty, quoting from
The Daily Telegraph - not the party's usual choice of house journal.
The party authorities drew the line on nostalgia when a lilac-shirted Mr Ted
Knight, the former Lambeth council leader, rushed the stage to interject a
point of order. He was refused a hearing and was threatened with ejection.
That incident apart, the Smith-Beckett ticket was content to preside regally
over proceedings. The conference had been marginalised with the approval of
a new policymaking mechanism which will concentrate more power in the hands
of the ultra-loyal national executive committee.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Smith demands 'full account' of exit from ERM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, opposition leader, yesterday intensified his harrying of Mr
John Major over the UK's dispute with the Bundesbank.
He told the prime minister in a letter that it was unacceptable for Mr Major
to try to conclude the dispute with the German central bank by 'drawing a
line' under it.
He said the Bundesbank's statement, published in the Financial Times this
week, suggested an approach had been made to Britain over its realignment
within the ERM - contradicting the Treasury's version of events.
'(The) British public deserves to know the truth about all the options
considered,' Mr Smith wrote. He told Mr Major it was his responsibility 'to
provide a full account of the disastrous events which culminated in both an
estimated loss of Pounds 1bn on Black Wednesday and this country's
humiliating withdrawal from the ERM'.
Mr Smith reported Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, as saying the
Bank of England had not asked for extra help to save the pound beyond that
required under the European monetary system.
Meanwhile, the Labour party, which ended its conference in Blackpool
yesterday, is refusing to be explicit about its tactics when the Maastricht
bill resumes its Commons stages. Although the Labour leadership backs the
principle of closer European union, Mrs Margaret Beckett, deputy leader,
said the party would want to examine the bill's content, particularly in the
light of any changes made to satisfy the Danish people.
She said Labour would oppose attempts by the government to impose a
'guillotine' on the bill - a measure restricting the time allowed for debate
which is usually used to prevent filibustering by opponents.
Labour is conscious that the divide among its MPs over Maastricht is
substantial, although probably not as deep as among Conservatives.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Ugly noises mar quiet alliance: The reasons behind the
recent bout of Anglo-German acrimony
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A junior British minister, speaking in spring last year at the annual
Anglo-German Konigswinter conference, delivered an eloquent illustration of
the unevenness of ties between Britain and Germany. Emphasising how reunited
Germany should play a more active role in world affairs, he declared: 'We
would like the Germans to be more assertive - as long as they agree with
us.'
His remark provides an insight into the past few weeks' hubub between the
two countries over the decline of sterling and the future of European
integration. During the post-war period, Britain has always wanted a strong
relationship with Germany. But, as one of the two European countries (along
with France) with any pretensions to being a world power, Britain wanted to
define these links, as far as possible, on its own terms.
Now, as a result of Germany's development into Europe's pivotal economic and
political power, the favourable terms of the 1950s and 1960s - or even of
the 1970s and 1980s - are no longer on offer. Against a background of
evident British economic weakness, the relationship needs to be reshaped -
amid an atmosphere of bickering and mistrust which is hardly conducive to
mutual co-operation.
The criticisms by the British government, backed by the media, of alleged
German complicity in the pound's collapse have been only the latest example
of irritation. German ministers and officials - including some in the
Bundesbank - were severely irked by the lack of support for reunification
shown in 1989 and 1990 by the government of Mrs Margaret (now Lady)
Thatcher.
Both sides have done their best to forget the episode, along with the less
serious affair in 1990 over anti-German remarks by Mr Nicolas Ridley, then
industry secretary, who was forced to resign. But bruised feelings are still
there - manifest in barbed comments by Bonn officials as well as,
occasionally, by the German chancellor himself.
Not least because of the residue of ill-feeling, Mr John Major has made
repairing ties with Bonn one of his priorities since he took over the
premiership nearly two years ago. He has succeeded in building a good
working relationship with Mr Kohl - one which enabled him to achieve
Britain's 'opt-out' accords on economic and monetary union (Emu) and on the
social chapter at last December's Maastricht summit.
None the less, the skirmishing has flared up again during the past year.
Discontent has been sown by differences on matters ranging from policies
towards the former Yugoslavia to the European Fighter Aircraft. Germany's
quest for a permanent seat on the UN security council has also set some
alarm bells ringing in Britain. Last week, the Bonn government's (promptly
abandoned) plans to support officially a ceremony to commemorate the first
flight of Hitler's V2 rocket spurred strong rebukes from British newspapers
and politicians.
If the Anglo-German partnership - dubbed only a few years ago the 'quiet
alliance' - has grown cacaphonous, this is partly a reflection of the
growing problems both countries face at home. Germany is united. Yet,
preoccupied by the exacting (and seriously underestimated) economic and
social challenge it faces, it has yet to demonstrate that unification will
prove a success. Britain is not only debilitated by recession. It is also
caught between opposing fears of being ensnared in a German-dominated
federal Europe, and of being excluded from a 'core' of richer countries, led
by France and Germany, which could forge ahead with integration in a
'two-speed' Europe.
On both sides, there is edginess and oversensitivity, combined with
insufficient understanding for the other country's predicament. Just as
Britain sometimes fails to comprehend the strains on Germany caused by an
unprecedented influx of 400,000 asylum-seekers this year, the Bonn
government admits it was late in spotting the full political importance of
the pressures forcing sterling's exit from the ERM last month.
One German diplomat, upset at the readiness with which Nazi caricatures
surface in the British media, compares the climate - perhaps somewhat
drastically - to the sabre-rattling between the two countries before the
First World War. Certainly, the ramifications of comments on the recent
exchange market upheavals by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
president, bear a resemblance to the celebrated Daily Telegraph affair in
1908. Then, indiscreet interview remarks by Emperor Wilhelm sparked off a
crisis with Britain.
Mr Josef Joffe, foreign policy commentator of the Suddeutsche Zeitung, the
Munich-based newspaper, says he has been surprised by the anger towards
Germany in Whitehall in recent weeks. 'I never thought you could build good
cars, but I always thought you had a talent for keeping cool,' he says.
Lord Roll, a veteran diplomat and now president of S G Warburg, points to
the ease with which anti-German resentment can 'bubble up' in Britain.
'Ignorance and disdain, mixed up with envy and jealousy, tend to rise up and
poison the atmosphere.' He adds: 'This is dangerous, and it should be
stopped.'
Mr Major now says the same, with his appeal on Thursday for an end to the
'war of words' between the two countries - announced at the same time as his
decision to resubmit the Maastricht treaty to parliament. Mr Major's
strategy of attaining D-Mark-like currency stability has disastrously
misfired. But he appears to have been firmly told by Mr Kohl, during their
one-hour telephone conversation on Wednesday, that Britain's credibility
will take a further dive unless it goes ahead with ratifying the treaty.
In the light of the sterling debacle, the British government has been
jealous of France's success in the last fortnight in maintaining the franc's
parity against the D-Mark. Mr Major has, however, probably realised that too
evident a show of Euro-scepticism in Britain would end up strengthening the
Franco-German alliance - the opposite of what he intends.
In its European policies, Britain has one trump card to play with Germany.
Mr Kohl has his own domestic reasons - above all, growing opposition to the
abandonment of the D-Mark - for not proceeding too quickly to Emu. In view
of Britain's own scepticism about monetary union, Mr Major is thus a useful
ally to have on board.
In the end, though, the future of European integration depends not on
Britain, but on whether Germany overcomes its own economic difficulties in
the next few years. If it fails, Mr Kohl and Mr Major may face the prospect
not of a Europe of two speeds - but of a Europe proceeding at no speed at
all.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Bemused and bewildered: The reaction to British sound and
fury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Perhaps the single most significant indicator of German reaction to the
latest storm in Anglo-German relations is the fact that Bild Zeitung has
barely commented at all.
The mass circulation newspaper (4m-plus readers nationwide), which prides
itself on having its finger on the pulse of the German in the street, has so
far not deemed it worthy or relevant enough as an issue on which to wage
war.
It was not so back at the time of impending unification in 1989 and 1990,
when Britain's fears of a united Germany, intemperately expressed by the
then Mr Nicholas Ridley, turned into a raging slanging match between Bild
and the British tabloids.
This week the newspaper has done no more than mockingly report in a
down-page story that 'Germany-bashing' is the latest sport in Britain. It
lets the headlines in the Sun and the Daily Star speak for themselves.
Not that Germany is immune to the criticism it receives. Concern over the
international image of the country and its people is a full-time national
occupation. The damage to Germany's image wreaked by the skinhead attacks on
asylum-seekers in the east has caused an agonised debate. The insensitivity
of an anniversary to commemorate the launching of the V2 rocket was also
spotted - not thanks to any British protest - as a terrible mistake.
And yet the verbal onslaught being doled out by Mr Norman Lamont and his
Treasury spokesmen is being watched with something more like pained
bewilderment, and largely without response. It is a very one-sided war.
The row has revealed more about the continuing culture gap that exists
between Britain and Germany, in spite of years of close co-operation in the
European Community, than about fundamental differences of view.
On the one hand, German officials, not least Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
president of the Bundesbank, appear to be naive and ignorant about some of
the more aggressive practices of the Anglo-Saxon media, and the
super-charged state of the British political debate. Their attempts to
justify their actions have instantly been twisted into broadsides and
onslaughts in the conflict.
As for the British, they still prove congenitally incapable of understanding
the fiercely independent stance of the Bundesbank, and its refusal to take
orders from Bonn. What is often perceived in Germany as a tense debate
between Bonn and Frankfurt is interpreted back in Britain as a conspiracy.
German commentators have closed ranks in defence of the Bundesbank, an
institution which enjoys far more popular respect than the government itself
or any other post-war establishment.
'It is true that the Bundesbank is not the inventor of diplomatic tact,' the
conservative newspaper Die Welt said yesterday. 'But one thing it is not:
lacking in solidarity. That is why it cannot allow the myth to be created by
British politicians that sterling was brought down with a roll of German
dice.
'It is absurd to say that the fall of the pound was stage-managed by the
Bundesbank. It was determined by the markets.'
That is the German consensus, and no amount of sound and fury from
Westminster and Whitehall will shake it.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Leading Article: Leading from weakness
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINI-SUMMITS at which world leaders so often meet are becoming
increasingly like group encounters, or therapy sessions. Participants
alternately seek to console one another, or fly into tantrums. This is
hardly surprising; seldom have so many important governments been so
dangerously weak.
President Mitterrand can at least retire gracefully if he wishes, for
convincing medical reasons. President Bush can only be saved by an electoral
wonder; Chancellor Kohl has somewhat longer to rebuild his ruined prestige.
Mr Miyazawa is accused of covering up yet more corruption in the Japanese
ruling party. Meanwhile Mr Major, who stood out until only a few weeks ago
as the one secure and confident leader in the big industrial countries, has
joined the critical list. Only Mr Amato in Italy and President Yeltsin in
Moscow enjoy the grim security which comes from manifest national crisis.
The reasons are all at bottom economic, but there are three quite different
problems intertwined. The English-speaking countries and Japan are suffering
what is at heart a financial crisis. In all these countries the banking
system is sick from the excesses of the 1980s, and kept weak by the belated
onset of supervisory prudence, which earmarks the bulk of banks' earnings
for balance sheet repairs. Meanwhile, creditworthy borrowers are badgered to
repay, and the more questionable kept on minimal life-support, with
devastating results for the small company sector.
Until banking recovery is complete - a matter of years even in favourable
circumstances - debt deflation is likely to persist. Massive damage can be
avoided only through large interest rate cuts, as the US and Japanese
authorities have clearly understood. But in continental Europe the problems
are quite different. The banking system is sound, but fiscal deficits are
excessive, mainly, of course, in Italy and in reunited Germany, which has
contracted symptoms from the third crisis - the collapse of the former
Communist economies.
Fears to persist
Even without the deflationary convergence conditions imposed by the
Maastricht treaty, the troubles of continental Europe would demand tight
monetary policy to offset government excess. That is why Britain's
membership of the ERM became unsustainable.
Even if better timing had enabled the country to join at a less demanding
exchange rate, the weakness of the economy would have undermined the
currency. The markets eventually find out an unsustainable policy.
Sterling has now been devalued sharply, but it continues to fall mainly
because of the perceived weakness of the government. Confidence will be
restored in due course if the government can convince the markets of its
anti-inflationary credentials. Even though actual inflation is likely to
remain low, the market's fears will persist like a toothache.
Mrs Thatcher showed an effective approach in 1981. It involved firm
resistance to public sector pay demands and fiscal tightening, including tax
increases - then, to check monetary growth, but necessary now to help
restore the external balance. Given an equally convincing package now, the
weakness of sterling would become a source of competitive strength: the
currency would be seen as undervalued, and the large interest-rate cuts
which some enthusiasts have been demanding could at last be made with
acceptable risk.
Difficult task
This is a demanding agenda for Mr Major, but at least he has time to tackle
it. The world's leaders jointly face a more difficult task: to prevent a
worldwide recession from inspiring a retreat into isolationism and trade
protection, as happened in the 1930s. This task is doubly difficult for weak
leaders. The impetus for European integration should keep Britain and her
partners on speaking terms, and must do so. Mr Major has quickly recognised
this, and so ended a terrible 10 days of his premiership with some credit.
But the US is the key to world co-operation, and progress will have to wait
for the election of its next president. It is encouraging at least that
there has been so little overt protectionism in the campaign so far, and
that Governor Clinton, a Fulbright protege, still the likely winner, may
turn out to have the instincts of an internationalist.
Continued co-operation and open trading are important for the most
prosperous countries in the world, but they would rub along without it. It
is vital, however, for the most disrupted and for the most dynamic countries
 -the former Communist world, which desperately needs some hope, and the
rapidly emerging market economies of the Pacific and Latin America, where
there is a risk that success could be smothered at birth. That success must
be preserved primarily for the sake of the huge populations at risk; but for
the richest countries Latin America offers not only growing markets, but
badly needed proof that there is, after all, life after debt.

FT  03 OCT 92 / Man in the News: Independent turn of mind - Sir Nigel
Broackes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Nigel Broackes, chairman of Trafalgar House, was his charming self when
the Keswicks called by early Thursday afternoon to alert him that Hongkong
Land had bought just under 15 per cent of his company and was about to
tender for another 15 per cent.
As soon Sir Nigel had shown the Hong Kong property owners the door he
launched into a tirade against their move, which he yesterday described as
'trying to get effective control without paying a bid premium'.
A Trafalgar executive said: 'Sir Nigel has been around a very long time. He
knows everyone in the City and will call in favours if he needs to. The
Keswicks would be foolish to underestimate his capacity to fight.'
But the problem for the 58-year-old chairman is that it is by no means clear
to whom he can turn. Five of his 10 biggest institutional shareholders
yesterday warmly welcomed the move by Hongkong Land. If their comments are
to be believed, Mr Simon Keswick, chairman of Hongkong Land, and Mr Henry
Keswick, chairman of Jardine Matheson Holdings, are a good deal more popular
that Sir Nigel.
Several businessmen who know him regard him as somewhat pompous and
occasionally complacent. One, who could have been expected to provide moral
support, said Trafalgar's situation was sad but was partly the chairman's
own doing. 'He chose to establish all these property joint ventures which
have turned out to be such bad news for the company.'
Just over a year ago when Trafalgar was valued at more than Pounds 2bn,
compared with Pounds 600m today, Sir Nigel felt confident in rejecting an
offer of co-operation with another big company that he might welcome today.
Lord Hanson, chairman of the Anglo-US conglomerate, who has known Sir Nigel
for years, asked him at a lunch whether there was any way in which the two
companies could work together. Nothing specific was mentioned. Sir Nigel
replied that there was no scope for a relationship.
Although the Hanson approach may not have been to Sir Nigel's liking, he has
indicated that he would like to sell some of Trafalgar's assets. However,
Lord Sterling, a contemporary and chairman of Peninsular and Oriental Steam
Navigation, which was the subject of a failed bid by Trafalgar in the early
1980s, appears unlikely to come to his aid by buying, for example, the fleet
of ships that Trafalgar's chairman is so keen to sell. Lord Sterling,
nevertheless, attests to Sir Nigel's ability for original thinking. 'He has
a most interesting strategic turn of mind.'
A stockbroker who has known Sir Nigel for more than 20 year says he is still
'very much the fighter he always was', and will still be able to rely on the
help of his influential City advisers, Kleinwort Benson, Lazard Brothers,
Cazenove, and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
The broker added: 'You only have to read his autobiography, A Growing
Concern, to realise that Sir Nigel does not give up easily. He will be
determined to fight Hongkong Land tooth and nail.'
As an only child, as were both his parents, he has always been determined to
get his own way. His upbringing was relatively harsh. In his autobiography
he describes his father as 'an extremely tough man' who would beat him for
misdemeanors such as dismantling the HMV gramophone. He was just eight when
his father died. 'My small world disintegrated,' he wrote.
Educated at Stowe public school, where he never got on well with his
teachers, he soon realised he was ambitious and could get his own way. He
left at 16. He went on to lose almost all of a Pounds 30,000 inheritance by
the time he was 23, on bad property deals. But just when he desperately
needed a break, he injected his last remaining property asset, a block of
seven flats in London's Great Cumberland Place, into the fledgling
Trafalgar.
He went on to become Trafalgar's managing director at 24, was a millionaire
four years later and chairman of the company by 35. A tall, imposing man,
with a gravelly voice, Sir Nigel had little difficultly in making his
presence felt.
He was never a hands-on manager. Lord Matthews, who was managing director
and then chief executive of Trafalgar House in the late 1970s until he
retired in 1983, says:
'What did Sir Nigel do? Good question. He was always there and had opinions
on things. I was influenced by what he had to say. We were a team; I did the
work and he contemplated the future from his office. He has never been one
of the world's great workers.'
Sir Nigel believes Lord Matthews is 'slightly exaggerating'. From 1963 to
1969 he says he was 'very much a hands-on manager'.
Lord Matthews says he found it difficult to understand what Sir Nigel's
interests in life were, except for an enjoyment of the trappings of a rich
man. In his autobiography, Sir Nigel describes the importance of those
trappings, which include an Oliver Hill-designed house in Chelsea Square, a
weekend retreat in Oxfordshire, a mansion near Nice and a yacht anchored in
the Mediterranean. He said yesterday that as chairman of the Crafts Council
and director of the Maritime Museum, he also had many cultural interests.
It would be a mistake, says Lord Matthews, to underestimate him. 'He is a
shrewd man; he is not a chap to play poker with.'
Perhaps Sir Nigel's greatest test will be to ensure that Trafalgar's board
is seen to be united. It is an open secret that Sir Nigel has not always
seen eye to eye with Sir Eric Parker, chief executive. Lord Matthews says:
'I think Eric, who is a first-class accountant, is resentful of the fact
that he has to do all the work.'
Sir Eric yesterday confined his comments to the fact that over the 27 years
he has known Sir Nigel the two men have had vigorous 'discussions . . . but
the board is at one.'
Since Hongkong Land launched its dawn raid on Trafalgar, Sir Nigel has
chosen to stay out of the limelight. 'That,' said one of the group's
financial advisers, 'is confirmation that Sir Nigel has decided that the
best way to avoid reports of boardroom splits is let his chief executive do
the running. He will do anything to help Trafalgar remain independent.'
