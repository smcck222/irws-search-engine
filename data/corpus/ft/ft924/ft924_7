FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (5): The worst may be over -
Regional report: North America
</HEADLINE>

THE BEST that can be said for the North American pulp and paper industry is
that signs are emerging of a patchy recovery.
But the emphasis is patchy. Price discounting and spare capacity are still
prevalent in many sectors. International Paper, the biggest US producer,
reported a 7 per cent drop in third-quarter earnings with the comment that
prices for uncoated papers remain under pressure. Georgia-Pacific, which
suffered a third-quarter loss, noted that much of the industry is still
burdened by high inventories and excess capacity. In mid-November, Mr
Sherman Chao, analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York, cut his 1993 earnings
estimates for seven US forestry groups on evidence that weakening
Scandinavian currencies and the strong US dollar are intensifying
competition from European pulp.
'The burden of world over-capacity will be borne more by the US industry,'
Mr Chao says, adding that soft pulp prices could ripple through to weak
prices for a wide range of papers. Nonetheless, there are signs that the
worst of the recession is over. Although Mr Chao has cut his 1993 earnings
estimates, the revised figures still represent an improvement on this year's
expected performance. Another analyst, Mr Chip Dillon, of Salomon Brothers,
predicted in a recent report that prices of lumber, linerboard, pulp,
newsprint, uncoated and coated papers, and tissue should all recover during
1993, although in some cases, the upturn will be shallow. Producers of
lightweight coated papers lifted prices by 4 per cent on October 1, and
east-coast newsprint producers succeeded in pushing through a 5 per cent
price increase (or, to be more precise, a 5 per cent cut in list-price
discounts) on August 1. An official at Abitibi-Price, the Toronto-based
newsprint-maker, says that 'demand has been a little more sustained than we
originally thought.' Abitibi has cancelled much of the downtime which it
planned for its newsprint machines in the second half of this year.
Canadian pulp and paper makers, whose high costs have made them the heaviest
casualties of the recession, are also benefiting from a 13 per cent tumble
in the Canadian dollar against the US currency over the past year. British
Columbia's Council of Forest Industries predicts that Canadian west-coast
producers could, on aggregate, break even or show a small profit in 1993
after combined losses of almost CDollars 900m in 1991 and an estimated
CDollars 400-500m this year.
The cautiously upbeat mood is based on hopes of a recovery in the US economy
from 1993, and on the painful restructuring which has taken place within the
North American pulp and paper industry over the past three years. The
optimists' argument runs that, as a sector which is traditionally sensitive
to the business cycle, the paper industry could be among the early winners
of any economic stimulus administered by the new Clinton administration in
Washington.
Industry operating rates already exceed levels normally seen at the start of
an economic upswing. Linerboard mills, which produce the inner and outer
layers of a corrugated cardboard box, are operating at almost full capacity,
and are expected to push through a price increase before the end of the
winter.
Furthermore, little new capacity is likely to come on-stream in the early
stages of the recovery. According to Mr Dillon, of Salomon Brothers, the
American Paper Institute's (API) forecast of new capacity, due to be
published later this month, will point to an annual increase of only 1.2-1.4
per cent. This compares with the API's earlier forecasts of 1.8 per cent
annual expansion between 1991 and 1994, and an average of 2.8 per cent in
the three decades to 1990.
A recovery will be especially welcome to the newsprint industry, which has
seen some of the most wrenching changes of the past few years. Customers
have become more demanding, with the range of products expanding to include
soft-calendered, high-gloss and coloured newsprint, as well as a growing
quantity of paper made from recycled pulp.
According to the API, some 52 per cent of all newsprint is now recovered for
recycling in the US, up from 35 per cent in 1988. More than half of all
corrugated material is also recovered.
Fierce competition has put especially heavy pressure on Canadian newsprint
producers, whose capacity shrank from a peak of 10.3m tonnes last year to
9.8m tonnes in September. With the rising demand for recycled newsprint,
Canadian mills have been handicapped by their distance from the main urban
centres. The Canadian industry has also paid the price of a high cost
structure. Several old, inefficient machines, mostly in eastern Canada, have
been closed down.
According to the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association, shipments to the US
tumbled to 4.23m tonnes in the first nine months of 1992, from 4.88m tonnes
in the same period of 1990.
Meanwhile, US suppliers' share of their home market has climbed from 4.16m
tonnes to 4.27m tonnes, but the US newsprint market itself has become more
fragmented. California's ailing economy and sagging demand in Japan have
opened a gap of about Dollars 35 a tonne between east- and west-coast
newsprint prices.
At least one big California newspaper publisher is understood to have told
suppliers that it is unable to accept any discount reduction for the time
being. By contrast, east coast producers' thoughts are already turning to
another price increase next spring.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (3): Longer and deeper cycles - The
pulp industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN challenge facing the world's pulp industry is a familiar one - a
massive imbalance of supply and demand. But there is no obvious remedy for
the sector's dire operating rates, prices and profitability.
The predicament is all the more grim because, for a brief moment at the
beginning of the year, it thought the market had turned the corner. At that
stage, prices for northern softwood had tumbled from a peak in 1989 of
Dollars 840 a tonne to as low as Dollars 460. The industry reckoned that
Dollars 460 was the bottom, and during the first quarter of this year
started to push through price increases. At first, pulp producers' optimism
seemed justified. During the first six months, prices headed upwards, with
list prices even reaching Dollars 600 a tonne, although there was still
considerable discounting. World shipments in Europe to the end of July
increased by 12 per cent, compared with last year's admittedly depressed
volumes, says Mr Roger Wright, of Hawkins Wright, the marketing and research
consultants. But then the market turned. 'Over the last few months, the
psychology has reversed,' says Mr Stephen Zinser, managing director of
European paper and packaging at Chase Manhattan Bank. 'Customers built up
inventories in anticipation of a strike in British Colombia. That proved
shorter than expected, and prices started heading down.' 'The recovery was
artificial - an illusion,' says Mr Wright. 'All that happened was that
inventories moved from producers to users, who thought prices were going to
move upwards. Paper consumption remained depressed, leaving customers with
higher stocks. Naturally they cut back on pulp orders.' One observer says it
would not be an exaggeration to say that prices are now in free-fall, with
list-prices for northern softwood at about Dollars 560, but discounted
transaction prices at as little as Dollars 450. Payment terms are also
becoming more generous.
Prices in real terms are lower than ever before, admits Mr Timo Teras,
senior vice-president of market research and planning at Finncell, the
Finnish pulp marketing organisation.
The question facing the industry is whether this is part of a normal cycle,
linked to the slow-down in the growth of the world economy, or whether
something more structural is occuring.
Certainly, the pulp industry's cycles appear to be getting longer and
deeper, according to Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, chief executive of the Swedish
group SCA.
The structural problems are not hard to identify. The most significant is
massive overcapacity. World supply is 34.8m tonnes, a 6 per cent increase on
1991. But world demand is only about 29.9m tonnes, and growing more slowly -
up 3 per cent on last year.
On the demand side, virgin pulp is facing increasing competition from
recycled fibre, whose growth has been pushed by environmental legislation,
particularly in the US and Germany. 'The fastest-growing 'forests' (waste
paper awaiting collection) are in the cities of Europe,' admits Dr Jan
Remrod, director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association.
The plight of some grades is worse than others. For northern softwood pulp,
the position is far worse, because it is losing market share to southern
softwood: annual capacity is at 9.3m tonnes, while demand is almost static
at 7.7m tonnes, according to Mr Wright.
The industry's difficulties have also been exacerbated by increased
integration over the past few years. European groups have added paper
machines to their pulp plants, reducing the size of the traded pulp market,
says Mr Teras, at Finncell. That has led to exaggerated swings in prices.
On the supply side, the imbalance is partly caused by pulp manufacturers
starting construction of new capacity simultaneously during the late 1980s.
But a structural shift of the economics of pulp production, between the
northern and southern hemispheres, is also taking place.
'The major threat to us is from countries like Chile and Brazil,' says Mr
Bernt Lof, chief executive of MoDo, the Swedish group.
He explains that a eucalyptus plantation in Brazil can be harvested in only
eight years, while pine in Chile can be cut after 30 years. That compares
with a period in Scandinavia of 80 to 100 years, because of the limited
short growing season during the short summers of northern climes.
Mr David Walker, vice-president of corporate analysis at Jaakko Poyry Oy,
the paper and pulp consultants, estimates that wood costs in Chile are a
third of those in Scandinavia.
In addition, the cost of transporting wood in Scandinavia is higher, because
a greater surface area is needed to supply the pulp mills, says Mr Lof, at
MoDo. Harvesting costs are also less, because of lower wages in South
America.
The build-up of South American production has been rapid and substantial. In
Brazil, Aracruz has just completed a Dollars 1.2bn expansion programme,
including a new 525,000-tonne a year line at its plant in Espirito Santo,
north of Rio de Janeiro. In addition, Bahia Sul has started production at a
plant. Eventual yearly production will exceed 400,000 tonnes, but a 250,000
tonnes a year paper plant should start next year. Chile has added capacity
of 1m tonnes a year over the last 18 months, three-quarters of which is
pine-based with the balance provided by eucalyptus.
With supply outstripping demand and prices still poor, operating rates
remain terrible, says Mr Wright. Manufacturers, whose inventories are
building up, are likely to close plants for maintenance for extended
periods, he reckons.
Most pulp producers are busy cutting costs. MoDo, for example, is believed
to have saved about SKr1bn (Pounds 96.7m) over the last three years through
cost- cutting. Mr Lof says a further SKr1bn will be saved next year and
another SKr300m could follow, but after that he'll start praying.
Finnish groups have also been cutting their cost-base. A combination of the
devaluation of the markka and reduction in labour and energy costs have
helped to some extent, says Mr Teras, at Finncell. 'We need every margin
possible,' he adds.
Mr Jan Remrod, director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association,
points out that Scandinavian costs are falling as those of South American
producers start to rise.
But in spite of cost-cutting, a structural imbalance remains. There is
little sign of an upturn in the world economy to allow demand to catch
supply. The economies of Germany and most of the rest of Europe appear to be
slowing, as is that of Japan. The US may be beginning to pick up, but the
growth in market pulp there is limited because so much production is
integrated into paper production.
The most obvious way to solve the crisis would be to close capacity. Mr Lof,
at MoDo, points the finger at Canadian producers. 'Their pulp mills are
small and old. It will cost a fortune to improve their environmental
performance. They are obvious candidates for closure.' Nevertheless, the
barriers to exit are formidable.
The Scandinavians' position may be less precarious. The Swedes have slashed
costs, while investing heavily in new plant to produce the totally
chlorine-free pulp now increasingly demanded by German, Austrian and Swiss
consumers.
Mr Wright says that, although Nordic wood costs are still more than 80 per
cent higher than in the US and Chile, they should continue to fall through
the 1990s as more softwood resources reach maturity.
Finnish companies are also making efforts to become more cost-competitive.
Whether such measures are enough to secure the long-term future of northern
hemisphere manufacturers remains to be seen.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (2): The green conundrum - The
industry and the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'green' challenge facing the pulp and paper industry is not just
creating demands for cleaner higher-quality products, but it is also
beginning to disrupt many of the previously-accepted economic patterns in
the industry.
As a result of the more widespread use of waste papers throughout the
developed world, the industry's centre of gravity is slowly shifting from
the virgin forests of the Nordic countries and Canada towards the more
highly populated 'urban forests' of central Europe and the US.
There is a limit to this process, because the recycling loop can never be
entirely closed; there will always be a need for the input of fresh virgin
pulps to strengthen the fibre content of paper products. But the trend is
clear and unmistakeable.
According to a recent Financial Times Management Report, the amount of waste
paper recovered and re-used to produce more paper rose from 60m tonnes in
1985 to almost 84m tonnes by 1990. It is forecast to climb to 150m tonnes by
the end of the decade.
Its growing utilisation has begun to change the entire economics of paper
production in many countries, as manufacturers find it more cost-effective
to build new plants near the centres of waste paper supply. The UK is a
prime example.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, the strength of the British paper industry
was sapped by labour unrest, high production costs and the awkward pressures
caused by its dependence on pulp imports bought directly from rival
Scandinavian companies, which produced both raw pulp and finished paper
products.
But the indigenous UK manufacturing industry was largely 'saved' by
switching to the use of cheap raw materials, in the form of newspapers
collected from the UK's centres of population. The industry's utilisation
rate (defined as the amount of waste paper re-used in production) now stands
at 60 per cent - one of the highest in Europe - although its economics have
recently been threatened, as a result of the falling European prices for
waste paper caused by a glut of supply stemming from mandatory recycling
schemes in Germany. The paper industry in Germany is now in the process of
building four paper mills to soak up this excess supply, further emphasising
the shift towards locating plants near their end markets.
But in spite of the economic attractions, the simple environmental equation
that all recycling is necessarily good has exasperated the industry. In many
respects, the paper producers argue that this simple truism is not, in fact,
true and that the energy and environmental costs of additional paper
recycling do not add up in some circumstances.
The industry suggests that paper is, anyway, an infinitely renewable and
benign resource if properly managed. What is the difference between
harvesting properly-cultivated trees and corn or wheat - other than a vast
divergence in growing times, they ask?
According to industry estimates, 94 per cent of the wood used by European
paper and board producers comes from sustainable managed forests, with the
other 6 per cent coming from North America and the countries of the former
Soviet Union. For a long time, more trees have been planted in Europe than
have been felled each year.
However, despite the industry's best efforts, environmental campaigners
still find much to protest about in forestry and paper manufacturing
practices around the world. The environmental damage caused by 'clear-cut'
fellings, when whole forests are harvested at one time, has alarmed many
environmentalists, although the industry is trying to limit this practice
and argues that the damage is only temporary.
Campaigners also worry when conifer and eucalyptus forests are planted
without due regard for their impact on local fauna and flora. Such unnatural
forests can cause ecological 'mono-cultures', destroying the diversity of
species that are normally found in varied forests.
Environmentalists also highlight the level of effluents produced at some
pulp and paper mills - although, again, the industry, prompted in many cases
by government legislation, has gone far to clean up its act.
Attention has also focused on the level of harmful dioxins created by
chlorine-bleaching of pulp, a process which is used to brighten paper
products. These toxic dioxins are caused by the chlorine reacting with the
lignin in the wood. Although the level of dioxins in paper is minute (less
than 8.2 parts per trillion) and there is scant evidence to suggest that
people have been harmed by handling their products, the issue became
something of a cause celebre in the late 1980s as a result of a rash of wild
fears about dioxin poisoning from chlorine-bleached nappies.
As a result of the public outcry, companies have generally stopped using
chlorine-bleached paper for nappies, and are reducing its use elsewhere
while investigating alternative bleaching agents.
Many companies have made a virtue of this necessity by marketing their paper
products as 'green', and some have even cheekily added a price premium for
the supposed environmental benefit.
The packaging of paper products has also become the subject of environmental
and marketing scrutiny. Arjo Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper
group, for example, has reported sales successes of its carbonless papers in
Germany, as a result of wrapping them in an innovative new packaging system
made from layers of recycled paper.
Such economic impulses, combined with the emotional connotations associated
with the environment, will ensure that green issues remain at the forefront
of the paper industry's concerns for the foreseeable future.
Yet some fear that environmental initiatives can sometimes act as an
impediment to trade, concealing protectionist impulses. The 'green card' may
well be played to defend western European markets from 'dirty' exports from
cheap manufacturers in eastern Europe, they suggest.
It is clear that those companies that can, and do, ride the environmental
tide will prosper; those that ignore it will surely suffer.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (4): Leaving the roller-coaster -
Merchanting and added-value papers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLLER-coaster ride of the paper industry, from outstanding profits to
numbing losses, may be exhilarating, but it is a far from comfortable.
Pulp and most grades of paper represent classic examples of cyclical
industries. And they are becoming more and more classical as each
down-draught of the cycle appears to become increasingly deep and long.
One reason is the growing size of paper machines. A world-scale competitive
paper plant now has a capacity of at least 200,000 tonnes a year, and
sometimes more than 300,000 tonnes, explains Mr Denis Christie, paper, pulp
and packaging analyst at James Capel.
Each time a new plant comes on-stream it adds a significant chunk to
regional capacity. Most paper groups demonstrate lemming-like behaviour when
the economic cycle is at its peak. Unwilling to lose market share, they
invest in these new increasingly large plants simultaneously, aggravating
the subsequent imbalance of supply and demand.
Not surprisingly, the more enlightened paper groups have attempted to get
off the roller-coaster by diversifying into less cyclical paper businesses.
These range from packaging to specialist papers and even merchanting.
The Swedes have for some time been masters of adding value to paper. Mr
Sverker Martin-Lof, chief executive of SCA of Sweden, explains that Swedish
groups' home market is so small that they have to export, and these exports
have to be products that can stand long distribution and can be
differentiated.
That excludes commodity products, such as pulp and newsprint. Mr Martin-Lof
says Sweden cannot compete in the long-term in commodity products, because
of the high costs of production there. The group has integrated its pulp
production into paper products, to the extent that it is now a net buyer of
pulp.
SCA has spread its risk over the past 10 years by diversifying into hygiene
and packaging products. Mr Martin-Lof proudly points out that the baby-nappy
and feminine-protection markets have been almost unaffected by the
recession, growing at up to 5 per cent this year. Similarly, the packaging
market - for which SCA provides high-value coated paper - has expanded at
1.5 per cent to 2 per cent.
To provide its packaging and hygiene products to its customers, it has had
to move production to the continent, says Mr Martin-Lof. 'We can't sit and
die in Sweden,' he says.
Dr Jan Remrod, director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association,
explains that, traditionally, the industry has been based in the forest. Now
it has to look at the consumer. 'The Swedish government may not like it, but
any further investment in the medium-term is unlikely to be in Sweden.'
Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora, Europe's largest paper group, says
there is a clear trend that the industry is becoming less global, because
market demands are becoming more specific. Customers want quality and
just-in-time deliveries. That means moving to the continent.
'We have been in the vanguard of added-value,' Mr Berggren proclaims. 'We
are unrecognisable from the mid-1980s.' Stora has been moving further and
further from the pulp market. It used to sell up to 600,000 tonnes a year,
but it is now in a balanced position. Instead, the group has moved into
printing and writing papers as well as board for food packaging.
The example of the Swedes is now being followed by the Dutch. The recent
announcement by KNP, VRG and Buhrmann-Tetterode that they intended to merge
was driven by the desire to reduce their dependence upon pure paper markets.
Mr Robert van Oordt, chairman of Buhrmann-Tetterode, explains: 'Because new
paper machines have to be so large and can therefore distort the market so
easily, the risk of making a misjudgment is enormous. By having other
activities, we reduce the risk for the group of introducing new machines.'
The combined group will have only Fl 2bn (Pounds 442m) of its Fl 13bn
turnover in direct paper products. The counter-weights, as Mr van Oordt
calls them, include packaging, graphic systems, office equipment and paper
merchanting.
However, the attempts to escape cyclical commodity paper markets have not
always been entirely successful, explains Mr David Walker, vice-president of
corporate analysis at Jaakko Poyry, the Finnish consultants.
Paper companies have an unfortunate herdlike instinct, which means that,
once one group has identified a fast-growing niche area, most of the rest
plough in, leading to massive overcapacity and commodity-style prices. 'To
be frank,' says Mr Berggren, at Stora. 'Overcapacity is affecting most
grades at the moment.'
Mr Walker points out that a number of companies moved into the uncoated
super-calendered (SC) magazine market with mixed results. Repola has 800,000
tonnes annual capacity, Myllykoski 540,000 tonnes, Stora 475,000 tonnes and
SCA 330,000 tonnes.
Yet according to David Christie, analyst at James Capel, the outlook for SC
magazine papers is probably the bleakest of all paper types, because
capacity is expected to rise sharply over the next 18 months with the
start-up of two machines, one of Repola's and one of Norske Skog, with a
combined annual capacity of 550,000 tonnes. Naturally, operating rates,
prices and margins, are all poor.
Similarly, coated woodfree and carbonless are both areas with
high-technology content and added value; but both are afflicted by
overcapacity, says Mr Alain Soulas, newly appointed chief executive at Arjo
Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British paper group.
Prices of coated woodfree have fallen by about 23 per cent since 1989, in
spite of the market growing as much as 12 per cent a year.
Mr Soulas believes the most important way of protecting investments from
this sort of herdlike instinct is to brand products. He points to the
group's Idem brand, which has allowed it to keep 30 per cent of the market
and partially resist pricing pressure. He believes that achievement is
outstanding.
AWA's Conqueror writing-paper brand has actually increased both sales and
prices over the last 12 months, he says. Other successful niches include
playing-cards, banknotes, medical papers and labels.
AWA is also Europe's largest existing merchanting company, although it may
be challenged for that title by the new Dutch grouping. Mr Soulas believes
about half of AWA's turnover in Europe has not been affected by the
downturn.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Survey of Pulp and Paper (1): A self-inflicted wound - The
collapse in profitability has been global, as recession and overcapacity
cloud the industries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PULP and paper industry is going through the shredder. Last year it
presumed that prices had plumbed the bottom. It was mistaken. The downturn
has been deeper and more prolonged than expected. For most groups, margins,
prices and profits are still spiralling downward.
The main challenge facing the sector is not lack of demand. For most grades
that continues to rise. The affliction besetting the industry is
self-inflicted - overcapacity. The question is whether this is a normal part
of the paper cycle, or a fundamental structural change.
The immediate cause of the overcapacity is all too familiar, says Dr Jan
Remrod, director general of the Swedish pulp and paper association. 'The
good years of the late 1980s stimulated over-investment.'
With supply outstripping demand, operating rates have fallen sharply, and
with them prices, margins and profits. For some grades of paper, prices have
fallen by as much as 40 per cent over the past two years. The collapse in
profitability has been global. Sweden's forestry companies expect to make a
collective loss this year of SKr2bn (Pounds 193m), compared with a profit
only two years ago of SKr12bn.
In the US, earnings at International Paper, the world's largest paper
company, fell during the second and third quarters this year. Meanwhile, in
Japan, Jujo, the third-ranking company, and Sanyo-Kokusaku, fifth-ranked,
reported sharp profit falls of 49 per cent and 68 per cent respectively for
the last financial year.
The plight of paper groups has been aggravated this year by turmoil in the
currency markets. European commodity manufacturers suffered particularly
from the depreciation of the dollar. Canadian and US manufacturers, faced
with poor domestic demand, took advantage of the dollars' weakness to boost
imports into Europe, intensifying problems there.
'Many European producers have been hurt as much by the dollar as
overcapacity,' says Mr Stephen Zinser, managing director of European paper
and packaging at Chase Manhattan Bank.
Scandinavian groups have particularly suffered from fluctuating currencies.
The decision to float the Finnish markka last September gave a significant
push for paper groups there, but placed the Swedes at a meaningful
disadvantage. There was near panic among Swedish producers until the Swedish
Krona was also devalued in November.
The benefits of devaluation were initially considerable. 'It was manna from
heaven. It added 10 per cent to 15 per cent to turnover overnight,' says Mr
Zinser at Chase Manhattan.
He explains that hardly any of the Scandinavians' costs - mostly energy and
wood - are dollar-denominated, so little currency-related inflation is
imported. Meanwhile, revenues from Swedish-based plants increased
immediately, both through currency translation and added volume through more
attractive pricing.
However, in the medium-term, the benefits are less clear. As exchange-rate
benefits work their way through, customers expect some to be passed on to
them, driving prices down even further for the rest of the industry, says Mr
Denis Christie, paper and pulp analyst at James Capel. In addition, the
acquisition binge by Finnish and Swedish groups on the continent, during the
late 1980s, has meant devaluations benefit them less than before.
Falling prices and the cost of expansion during the late 1980s - both of
capacity and acquisitions - have left their mark on paper companies' balance
sheets. With a few exceptions, such as KNP of the Netherlands and Arjo
Wiggins Appleton, the Franco-British group, paper companies' balance sheets
are over-stretched.
'Many groups in Scandinavia have debts greater than their turnover,' admits
Mr Timo Teras, senior vice-president of market research and planning at
Finncell, the Finnish pulp marketing organisation. Mr Thomas Nysten,
managing director of the Finnish paper marketing body Finnpap, says Finnish
groups are in more serious financial difficulties than those in other
countries, because their capital structures are weaker.
Most are now looking to cut their environmental capital spending. The
Swedish pulp and paper association reckons Swedish companies have spent
SKr30bn on the environment since 1987. 'We are in a position to slow down
our environmental expenditure - and that just suits us fine at the moment,'
says Mr Bo Berggren, chief executive of Stora, Europe's largest paper group.
Other costs are also under attack. In the UK, four plants have been closed
and 1,200 jobs lost during the last 12 months, according to the UK-based
Pulp and Paper Information Centre.
Meanwhile, Scandinavian and north American groups have launched fierce
cost-cutting exercises, including job losses, which Dutch and German
companies have so far been unable to emulate.
Dr Remrod, at the Swedish pulp and paper association, estimates that the
Swedish industry has cut its workforce by 30 per cent - some 200,000
employees - in the past three years. Stora, Europe's largest paper group,
has reduced the number of its employees from 45,000 to 39,000, and says more
job losses are on the way. Mr Bernt Lof, chief executive of MoDo, the
Swedish paper group, laments: 'We are closing mills that in three to five
years time would be competitive.'
However, it is far from clear whether such cost-cutting will be enough to
let Nordic producers compete in the long-term with low-cost manufacturers in
South America and Asia. Higher wages, transport and energy costs and the
simple problem that trees in Scandinavian countries only grow 100 days a
year, compared with 365 in Brazil, all work to the Scandinavians'
disadvantage.
The flight by European companies from pulp and commodity grades to
added-value papers has not been altogether successful. The rush into a
number of fast-growing niche markets, such as coated woodfree, has merely
shifted overcapacity down the product chain.
Shortage of cash has brought the heady acquisition activity of the late
1980s to an almost complete standstill. The only significant exceptions
during the last 12 months included the DM400m (Pounds 166m) purchase in May
of 90 per cent of Hannover Papier, one of Germany's leading producers of
coated woodfree paper, by Sappi, the South African pulp and paper company.
International Paper also acquired an 80 per cent stake in Kwidzyn Pulp and
Paper Company, Poland's largest paper group, for Dollars 120m.
In spite of the paucity of acquisition activity, a consolidation process is
inevitable, according to Mr Sverker Martin-Lof, chief executive of SCA. He
says weak balance sheets will force groups together to allow them to cut
costs. The most likely route for the present is through mergers rather than
acquisitions.
'Given the premium needed to purchase paper companies at the moment, it's
nearly impossible to put together any acquisition of substantial size,' says
Mr Michael Bottenheim, a managing director at Lazards, the merchant bankers.
In Japan, Jujo Paper and Sanyo-Kokusaku Pulp, two leading Japanese paper
producers led the way in July when they merged to create the country's
largest papermaker. And last month the Dutch groups, KNP, VRG and
Buhrmann-Tetterode, announced their intention to create Europe's
second-largest paper and packaging group. Further mergers in Scandinavia are
likely in the coming years.
The main banking requirements will be for debt refinancing. Many companies
need to refinance next year, but will have to renegotiate on the basis of
poor 1992 results. Refunding will unhappily coincide with the bottom of the
cycle. It is a brave bank at the moment that wants to increase its
investment in the paper industry.
Nordic groups are faced with the steepest refinancing challenge. Given the
reluctance of international banks to finance paper groups, they would
normally fall back on their domestic counterparts. But the Scandinavian
banking system is in crisis.
Many paper companies are now looking at project finance which can be carried
off-balance sheet. An alternative would be to try to access other European
equity markets, if only paper companies can convince investors of their
longer-term prospects.
The outlook for the industry is so uncertain that most groups have stopped
offering prophesies. Most executives have been repeatedly guilty of wishful
thinking. Mr Berggren, at Stora, says: 'We have been wrong so many times, we
have given up trying to predict. But there are no signs of improvement.'
Mr Martin-Lof, at SCA, believes this downturn is longer and deeper than
others. The overcapacity, in some grades, could last until the late 1990s,
he says.
Nearly every paper company reckons it will become a money making machine -
just as soon as the recovery comes. The problem is that nobody knows when
the recovery will arrive.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Anxiously awaiting a duty-free-for-all: Tobacco and alcohol
retailers' fears about the single market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's drink and tobacco retailers fear that the creation of the European
single market next month will start a cross-Channel shopping boom that will
wreak severe damage on their businesses.
Although duty-free allowances will remain in force, limits on the amounts of
beer, wine, spirits and cigarettes travellers can bring back from
Continental hypermarkets for personal consumption will be abolished on
January 1.
Lower duties and taxes levied on the goods in France and other EC countries
are expected to tempt growing numbers of UK shoppers across the Channel.
Mr Peter Lewis, director of the Wines and Spirits Association, says: 'We are
very apprehensive. Some small traders may be forced out of business before
the government realises it is losing an unacceptable amount of revenue.'
The threat of large-scale commercial smuggling as Customs formalities are
withdrawn from Channel ports is particularly worrying to retailers in
southern England.
Even under the present restrictions on personal duty-paid imports - 1.5
litres of spirits, 50 litres of beer, and five litres of wine - it is
estimated that liquor purchases abroad total Pounds 350m a year. That is
equivalent to the annual drinks sales of Co-operative Retail Services.
Beer brought into the country by returning holidaymakers already accounts
for 5 per cent of the UK's take-home beer market.
Next year, each adult will be allowed to bring in up to 10 litres of
spirits, 90 litres of wine, 110 litres of beer, 200 cigars and 800
cigarettes for personal use. But these are merely 'indicative levels' to
help Customs and Excise distinguish between genuinely private imports and
commercial trade.
The onus will be on anyone bringing above those amounts into the country to
prove that they are for personal use - but a family wedding, say, would be
an acceptable reason for exceeding the levels.
The changes will offer cross-Channel shoppers some tempting bargains in
spite of the recent sterling devaluation. A couple bringing back their full
liquor allowance would save Pounds 350 in tax after paying for the ferry
crossing and a good meal in Boulogne, according to the Brewers' Society.
Some comparisons of retail prices suggest possibly much higher savings. A
half litre of Stella Artois lager is 60p cheaper in France than in the UK
and a bottle of Morgon Beaujolais is little more than half the UK price. A
packet of 20 cigarettes costs Pounds 1 less.
Nobody, of course, knows how British consumers will react to the
opportunity. Customs officials, pointing out that a quarter of the 25m
cross-Channel trippers a year return with less than their duty-free
allowances, predict a brief initial rush of bargain hunters, then a return
to more normal levels of traffic.
Relatively few travellers, they believe, will have the money to buy in bulk
or the space in their cars and caravans for more than a fraction of the
allowance.
P&amp;O Ferries, preoccupied with taking over Customs' task of policing
duty-free purchases aboard its vessels next year, tends to agree. It does
not expect its ferries to be swamped with shoppers.
The Treasury, which last year collected more than Pounds 11bn in duty on
liquor and tobacco, forecasts losses of about Pounds 250m in excise revenue
from cross-Channel buying next year.
The brewing and tobacco industries predict that the loss of revenue will be
considerably higher. The Brewers' Society calculates that Pounds 100m will
be lost on beer imports alone. The Tobacco Advisory Council says UK
cigarette sales might fall by 6bn, resulting in a revenue loss of Pounds
400m.
One Scottish bus company is said to be taking bookings for cross-Channel
trips on which each coach will be accompanied by a lorry to carry the
passengers' goods home.
Nor do events on other borders between high-tax and low-tax countries lend
support to a sanguine view of prospects. Denmark's consumers buy 13 per cent
of their beer across the border in Germany. Canadian customers account for
25 per cent of the turnover of US drinks retailers along the border between
those two countries.
Mr Bill Simpson, of Whitbread's corporate planning staff, says: 'We are very
concerned about the possible effect of extensive cross-Channel shopping. The
beer allowance is roughly equal to the average annual consumption per head
in the UK - and five times the average amount a consumer drinks at home.'
Mr David Coxon, trading director of the retail chain Victoria Wine, says the
increased allowances 'clearly represent another form of competition for
beer, wine and spirits retailers'.
Denmark had started to cut its taxes to narrow the differential with
Germany, but the UK government had rejected calls to peg or cut duty.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Sales upswing continues for commercial vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMERCIAL vehicle market appears to be accelerating out of its steepest
recession since the second world war.
Total van, truck and bus sales were 15.25 per cent higher in November than
in the same month last year, according to figures from the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders - although some exceptional deliveries of light
vans to operators of very large fleets exaggerated the strength of the
upsurge.
Makers of heavy trucks, worst affected by the recession, were encouraged by
the strongest monthly rise in five consecutive months of recovery.
Mr David Gill, Leyland DAF's managing director of sales and marketing,
predicted that next year's truck market would be larger than the 31,000
expected this year.
He refused to make a specific growth forecast. He said: 'If the government
hasn't a clue about what's happening in the economy, what hope is there for
the rest of us? But trucks are usually the last to go into recession and the
first to come out, so it's not unreasonable to put in a slight upward
curve.'
He was speaking at the UK launch of DAF's new 75 and 85 truck ranges.
November's 10.48 per cent rise over November last year in sales of trucks
over 3.5 tonnes to 2,698 follows four single-figure percentage-point
increases since the market first turned for the truck sector in June, after
33 consecutive months of decline.
For some truckmakers it cannot come too soon, with savage discounting
further eroding the industry's profit margins.
ERF, based at Sandbach, Cheshire, and the UK's last independent heavy
truckmaker, has just reported a pre-tax interim loss of Pounds 2.73m,
compared with a Pounds 330,000 profit in the same period last year.
Nevertheless, both Mr Peter Foden, ERF chairman, and Sir Hal Miller, the
SMMT chief executive, said that the industry's 'green shoots' of recovery
were starting to show through.
It is likely that sales this year of heavy trucks of 15 tonnes and more will
be up on last year. They were below last year's level until September but by
the end of last month were 2.05 per cent ahead on the year. All other
sectors continue to lag behind on the year. The sales to November of 189,031
are 4.4 per cent below last year's figure of 197,733.
Imports rose slightly last month, taking a 39.85 per cent market share
compared with the previous November's 39.03 per cent.
November's light van market jumped by 48.23 per cent, to 6,165, because of
big fleet deliveries by Ford and Vauxhall. Between them they accounted for
84 per cent of all sales in the sector.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Major moves to regain political initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to launch a new year drive to regain its grip on the
domestic political agenda after its preoccupation in recent months with
economic crisis management and the battles in the Tory party over Europe.
Senior ministers are planning a series of initiatives to demonstrate that
the recent political turmoil has not dented the government's determination
to meet the policy objectives in its April election manifesto.
Among the initiatives will be measures to restructure and expand education
and training opportunities for the 16-to-19 age group; intensified
co-operation with business through developing an industrial strategy; and
significant reforms of the police and of the treatment of juvenile
offenders.
Mr John Major is anxious also to restore the momentum of the Citizen's
Charter by tightening the standards set for public services.
Plans for the policy launches reflect growing if still cautious confidence
among ministers that the signs of economic recovery have lifted the state of
siege imposed on the government by sterling's exit from the European
exchange rate mechanism in September.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said yesterday he was hopeful that the
combination of a sharp fall in interest rates, the fall in the value of the
pound and the recovery measures in the Autumn Statement was beginning to
yield results. He said that businessmen were now sounding more optimistic as
Britain had positioned itself in a way that held out better prospects for
growth.
Other ministers said the successful outcome of this weekend's Edinburgh
summit would also support Mr Major's efforts to rebuild his authority after
the disasters of the past few months.
The prime minister was conscious, however, that the government needed to
dispel the impression of drift in domestic policymaking. He was determined
that the central themes of the election manifesto - opportunity, choice and
responsibility - were fully reflected in Whitehall decisions.
The key elements in the new year package will be a restructuring of the
training and technical education available to teenagers. The Departments of
Education and Employment are to co-ordinate expansion of further education
places and the extension of training vouchers and vocational qualifications.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, plans to add substance
to the pledge of a new 'partnership' with manufacturing industry. The
immediate focus will be fresh deregulation, involving every department in
Whitehall.
Mr Major has signalled his interest in wider help for industry by calling a
Downing Street seminar for ministers and representatives of the food
industry.

FT  14 DEC 92 / MPs to increase Maxwell pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMITTEE of MPs will step up efforts this week to help pensioners
suffering because of the collapse of the Maxwell empire.
It is expected to express concern at the cost of unravelling the complex
deals involving pension funds' money.
Moral pressure on banks and individuals who benefited from transactions with
Robert Maxwell in the months before his death is likely to increase as the
cross-party social security committee decides tomorrow who it wants to give
evidence next year.
The committee, chaired by Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, is
drawing up reports expressing concern at the time and cost involved in
disentangling deals carried out by Mr Maxwell in the last year of his life.
The committee's MPs are also disappointed at the relatively low level of
voluntary donations to the fund set up to help Maxwell pensioners.
One member estimated yesterday that the legal and accountancy fees around
the world were approaching Pounds 100m. The committee now has a specialist
accountant from the National Audit Office seconded to help its inquiries.
The list of those called to give evidence is almost certain to include Lord
Donoughue, the Labour peer and a former director of a Maxwell investment
company, who has already given evidence once.
Others with past connections with the Maxwell empire and expected to be
asked include Lord Walker, the former Conservative cabinet minister, and
Lord Stevens, former chief executive of Invesco MIM, the UK fund management
group. City institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers and Credit
Suisse may also be called to give evidence.
Separately, the MPs are to urge the Goode inquiry into pension law, set up
by the government after the Maxwell empire collapse, to take a wide look at
the legal framework in which pension funds operate - and not just
concentrate on the Maxwell affair.
Most MPs on the committee are believed to back the setting up of a pension
compensation scheme, although it might involve huge expense, or government
involvement as an underwriter, if pension funds were to be guaranteed.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Nissan links with its suppliers' suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese carmaker, is strengthening its influence over the
quality, cost and delivery time of components it purchases for use at its
Sunderland plant by forg-ing links with its suppliers' suppliers.
In a pilot project, Nissan has trained some of its suppliers' purchasing
staff in its 'partnership philosophy' so they can help their suppliers cut
their production costs.
The initiative has led to Nissan personnel visiting 30 second-tier suppliers
so far, to work with them on eliminating waste and improving assembly-line
organisation. In some cases this has produced reductions in cost, and
therefore price, which are being passed along the chain to Nissan.
Mr Bob Gray, a purchasing manager at Sunderland, which will next year make
270,000 Primeras and Micras, said: 'We've developed a partnership philosophy
with our first-tier suppliers. The intention is to develop that down through
the sub-suppliers.
'We're trying to get them to drive their costs down rather than sit down, as
tradition has been in the industry, and negotiate the price.'
A report last month by Cardiff Business School, Cambridge University and
Andersen Consulting highlighted a productivity and quality gap between UK
and Japanese automotive components suppliers. Many European suppliers, Mr
Gray said, are not cost-competitive with Japan.
Nissan operated an 'open book' system with suppliers, analysing their costs
and production methods and agreeing a 'fair and realistic' profit, Mr Gray
said.
It floated the idea of its second-tier supplier experiment earlier this year
among nearly all its 195 European suppliers. It will next year buy Pounds
850m worth of components from them for use in Primeras and Micras. Mr Gray
said only five did not wish to get involved.
Thirty suppliers from the UK and the Continent sent purchasing staff to
Sunderland for workshop training in Nissan's partnership sourcing philosophy
 -'a commitment by the customer and supplier, regardless of size, to a
long-term relationship based on clear, mutually agreed objectives to strive
for world-class capability and competitiveness'.
Suppliers' staff then visited some of their suppliers. Mr Gray said Nissan
became directly involved with the second tier only by invitation. 'It's not
an imposition.' Most, he said, invited Nissan in.

FT  14 DEC 92 / US backing for female condom
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FEMIDOM, the female condom invented in Britain, has been recommended for
swift approval by an advisory committee of the US Food and Drug
Administration.
The FDA obstetrics and gynaecology devices committee said the condom, known
in the US as Reality, should prove significant in slowing the spread of the
HIV virus that causes Aids.
The committee had been concerned about the device's effectiveness but new
evidence showed the HIV virus was unable to permeate the condom's sheath.
The product is to be marketed in North America and Mexico by the US group
Wisconsin Pharmacal.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Currency turmoil pinned on dealers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange dealers, uneasy about loss of earnings, rebelled against
the prospect of European monetary union during the currency market turmoil
that climaxed on September 16, the deputy director of the Bank of Italy
argues in an article published today.
According to Mr Tommaso Padoa-Schioppa, the epicentre of the rebellion in
dealing rooms was London, where it interacted with 'the unresolved
reservations of British political circles and public opinion' about
relinquishing the exchange rate as a policy variable and the Queen's head on
the pound as a sign of national identity.
'It was almost as if, after years of subjugation to the idea that EMU had
become inevitable, the plethora of dealing room professionals earning their
money from exchange rate movements rebelled against the prospect of seeing
their shops closed, irrevocably locked, by a decree that would cancel a
whole set of rows and columns from the matrix of world exchange rates,' says
the article.
Mr Padoa-Schioppa's view, which appears in the London Business School's
latest International Economic Outlook, is that the European exchange rate
mechanism ultimately gave way to the tension created by four
hard-to-reconcile goals of the European Community - free trade, full capital
mobility, fixed exchange rates and national autonomy.
He argues that 'a much earlier passage to the third phase, if need be by a
group of countries, is the only truly structural solution to the
inconsistent quartet'.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Female condom set for US approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEMIDOM, the British-invented female condom, has been recommended for swift
approval by an advisory committee of the US Food and Drug Administration,
Paul Abrahams writes.
That would enable a rapid launch of the product in the world's largest
market.
The FDA obstetrics and gynaecology devices committee said the device, known
in the US as Reality, should prove significant in slowing the spread of the
HIV virus that causes Aids.
The committee had been concerned about the device's effectiveness but new
evidence showed the HIV virus was unable to permeate the condom's sheath.
The condom is also 88 per cent effective as a contraceptive, according to
Chartex International, the UK manufacturer.
The product is to be marketed in North America and Mexico by the US group
Wisconsin Pharmacal.
Femidom, a pliable polyurethane sheath which lines the vagina, was launched
in the UK in September. It is also marketed in Switzerland and Austria and
is due to be launched in the Netherlands next month.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is investing Pounds 14m to consolidate all its European sparkplug
production at its Treforest plant in south Wales.
About 100 employees will transfer to Treforest from Ford's engine
manufacturing facility at nearby Bridgend, where about 50 jobs had been
scheduled to be lost as part of a series of cuts throughout all Ford's UK
plants.
The move means the end of sparkplug production at Ford's Enfield plant,
north London, where Pounds 4.5m will be invested in substitute activities.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Law change on staff rest areas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS will have a legal obligation to provide tobacco-free rest areas
for non-smoking staff to comply with new regulations passed to carry out a
European health and safety directive.
The Workplace (Health, Safety and Welfare) regulations complete a series of
six new sets of regulations that come into force from January 1 and stem
from European directives.
This sixth and final set of regulations covers a range of areas including
ventilation and temperature, changing facilities and the condition of
floors.
The six sets of regulations are the most comprehensive reform of health and
safety at work in the UK for nearly two decades, covering areas ranging from
washroom facilities to visual display units and the lifting of heavy loads.
New workplaces opening for the first time on or after January 1, or those
which are modified, extended or converted, should comply with the new
smoking regulations straight away. Existing workplaces will have until
January 1 1996 to comply.
This set of regulations places obligations on the owners of buildings
occupied by more than one tenant to ensure that, for example, the common
parts of buildings, estate roads and other facilities meet the requirements.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Bucking the Trend: Bogus customers produce genuine profits -
Guy de Jonquieres explains how a market research company has grown rapidly
despite the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT A TIME when British companies are paring costs to the bone, asking them
to spend as much as Pounds 200,000 a year to serve bogus customers hardly
sounds like a winning formula. Yet it is providing BEM Research, a small
market research company, with the basis for a business that has thrived
through the recession.
BEM specialises in measuring customer service. Formed six years ago by three
partners with no market research experience, it now has more than 60
clients, for many of which it monitors service standards continuously.
They include the Automobile Association, electrical retailers Comet, Currys
and Dixons, Ladbroke's betting shops, McDonald's hamburger restaurants, the
Forte hotel and leisure group, several local councils and a clutch of
regional electricity boards.
The company has doubled turnover every year to reach Pounds 2m this year, on
which it will earn profits of Pounds 170,000, up from Pounds 36,000 last
year and Pounds 18,000 in 1990. UK market research spending as a whole
stagnated last year, although it has recovered since the spring.
BEM's special edge is the use of 'mystery' customers, who visit retail
outlets unannounced. Drawn from a team of 2,000 part-time researchers, they
are trained to evaluate service by acting as ordinary members of the public.
Mr Steve Jolliffe, managing director, says BEM has prospered during
recession because it delivers immediate feedback to its clients and
identifies cost-effective ways of improving customer satisfaction.
His claim is endorsed by Mr Martin Grant, managing director of Ansells
Retail, part of Allied Lyons: 'When times are tough, the most important
priority is to keep the business you've got. BEM has done so well because it
provides a tool which helps companies retain customers.'
Ansells says its 600 managed pubs have increased market share in the two
years since BEM began monitoring them and highlighted the importance to
customers of points such as clean lavatories and friendly bar service.
Mr Jolliffe, a 34-year-old former mining engineer, hit on the idea for
'mystery' customers - and decided to make a business out of it - after
receiving poor service at a restaurant several years ago. Incensed, he wrote
to the parent company recommending improvements. Many were put into effect,
and he was invited to survey other restaurants in the chain.
Since then, the technique has been refined. Before carrying out research,
BEM asks clients' customers what kind of service they expect and involves
employees in setting objectives.
Other market research companies, some of which initially frowned on
'mystery' customers, have begun to use the technique. But Mr Jolliffe is
confident that BEM can maintain its lead by continuing to invest in people
and technology.
'Our competitors have lots of resources but little experience. They use
trained interviewers who are used to holding clipboards and are easily
spotted. Our mystery customers only do one thing,' he says.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Managers report career worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES ARE failing to manage their managers and leaving a big gap between
company rhetoric and reality as perceived by middle managers, the Institute
of Management says.
A survey published by the institute today warns that if the gap is not
closed it might have long-term consequences for company performance as
managers' disillusionment grows. Organisations are increasingly focusing
reward systems on individual performance, yet half of the managers surveyed
believe their own pay packets bear little relation to their actual
contribution.
Few organisations have thought through the implications of reconciling the
trend towards more team working with the increased emphasis on rewarding
managers' individual performance. Any change to pay and benefits is largely
imposed from the top down. Fifty two per cent of individual respondents said
they had not been involved in developing plans for change.
Two thirds of managers believe their organisation pays insufficient
attention to their career management and development and two thirds are
worried about promotion.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Jobs loss in London 'to hit record'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNEMPLOYMENT IN London will rise to a post-war high of about 510,000 or 13
per cent in 1994, according to the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry's
annual economic review.
The report predicts that nearly 100,000 more jobs will be lost by 1994, with
much of the rise coming from service sectors and construction. Official
figures understate London's job losses as they do not include all commuters,
it adds. Over the past two years 300,000 jobs have been lost in London.
Ms Jacqui Ginnane, the chamber's chief economist, said: 'Our forecasts show
that the London economy will remain weak into the mid 1990s.'
The chamber expects GDP in London to grow by only 0.6 per cent in 1993 after
falling by 2.4 per cent this year. Some parts of financial and business
services, which account for nearly a quarter of London's GDP, may see better
trading next year but will continue to improve productivity and cut jobs, it
argues.
Manufacturing, which after several years of decline accounts for only 13 per
cent of London's GDP, is expected to raise output by 1 per cent in 1993
after a 2.2 per cent fall this year.
The report blames weakness in consumer demand for much of the lack of
recovery. Consumer spending is expected to grow by only 0.9 per cent next
year after falling 1.2 per cent this year.
Ms Ginnane said: 'No single sector is strong enough to lead the way out of
recession and we must therefore look to public-sector investment.' London's
perceived affluence had resulted in under-investment in the capital, she
added.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Mortgage cover causes concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT said yesterday that it was concerned about a planned change
in mortgage indemnity insurance that would make it difficult for the owners
of private flats in local-authority tower blocks to sell their properties.
The main mortgage indemnity insurers are negotiating with lenders to tighten
policies so that societies will normally be unable to get insurance for
mortgages on former council flats in blocks above seven storeys in height.
The Department of the Environment said it was worried about the
'seven-storey clause', put to lenders in a contract drawn up by four
insurance companies. It said it had made representations to the Council of
Mortgage Lenders. The clause would be awkward for the government because it
would limit the value of council flats bought under 'right-to-buy
legislation'. Although flats were sold at discount, it might cut their value
below that price.
The clause is among a series being negotiated between insurers and lenders.
The insurers are estimated to have lost Pounds 3bn in the wave of house
repossessions of the past three years, including defaults among former
council tenants, while gaining only Pounds 750m in premiums. Legal &amp;
General, one of the four companies providing most indemnity insurance, said
it would insist on keeping the clause, which would make lenders seek
approval for mortgages on council-block flats in order to gain insurance.
Mr Dane Douetil, a director of Special Risk Services, a Lloyd's insurance
broker, said the talks were causing 'a great deal of tension' because
insurers were insisting on indemnity policies becoming both more expensive
and restrictive.
The main terms of new mortgage indemnity contracts were agreed by insurers
and lenders in September. They replaced the old formula for indemnity
payments with one that makes lenders bear at least 20 per cent of the loss.
The insurers have insisted that lenders bear some of the future loss to make
them take more care over lending. The two sides were unable to agree the
subsidiary clauses by September, though, and a new deadline for agreement of
January has been set. Among the clauses are provisions to end insurers'
liability if lenders are defrauded by borrowers.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chairman of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, said the
lenders understood that insurers wanted to tighten the terms of mortgage
indemnity insurance, but it was likely to lead to restrictions in lending.

FT  14 DEC 92 / CBI urges single pensions regulator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry is calling for a single regulator to
supervise occupational pension schemes in its response to the government's
Pension Law Review Committee chaired by Professor Roy Goode.
In a report to be published today the CBI says the key to the future
security of occupational pension schemes lies in effective regulation and
supervision. It shares the view of Prudential, the UK's largest life
assurance company, that that requires a single body responsible for
supervision.
The Goode committee was set up in the wake of the frauds at pension schemes
associated with the late Robert Maxwell. The CBI says: 'The Maxwell
revelations must be set against the good record of around 460,000
occupational pension schemes. Additional costs must be carefully balanced
against the need to promote and encourage good pension provision.'
On the question of compensation schemes for pension shortfalls Sir Bryan
Corby, deputy president of the CBI, says: 'If such a scheme is introduced,
it should be in respect of fraud only and should not cover poor investment
or overfunding.'

FT  14 DEC 92 / Kidnap raises security stakes in Israel: Fundamentalists who
seized policeman demand release of leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISRAELI government is facing its severest security challenge since
taking power in July following the kidnap of a paramilitary police officer
yesterday by an Islamic fundamentalist group demanding the release of its
jailed leader.
The kidnapping inside Israel of the Border Police officer came on a weekend
when three Palestinians and a soldier were killed in the continuing surge of
armed attacks and violent demonstrations coinciding with last week's fifth
anniversary of the intifada, or uprising, against Israeli rule in the
occupied territories.
The government's reaction to the abduction, in the central city of Lod, will
be closely scrutinised by the opposition Likud party and its right-wing
allies which had already strongly criticised Mr Yitzhak Rabin, prime
minister, over the recent spate of violence.
Qassam, military wing of the Hamas Islamic fundamentalist movement,
announced it was holding Sgt-Major Nissim Toledano and would kill him if
Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, jailed for life in 1991 for ordering the
killing of Palestinian collaborators, was not freed by 9pm local time last
night.
The deadline passed without word from the kidnappers, who were the subject
of an intense manhunt by the security forces. In an interview from prison,
Mr Yassin said he hoped the kidnappers would give the authorities more time
to respond. The government, however, said it viewed the kidnapping with the
'utmost gravity' and warned the perpetrators against harming Sgt-Major
Toledano.
Qassam also claimed responsibility for death a soldier in an armed ambush
near the West Bank town of Hebron yesterday. It was the fifth such killing
by Qassam in less than a week and brought to 24 the number of soldiers
killed during the uprising. Hamas, which strongly opposes the current Middle
East peace talks, has grown in strength since it was founded by Sheikh
Yassin exactly five years ago.
In the Gaza Strip, two Palestinians were shot dead and more than 100 injured
in clashes with troops yesterday and on Saturday. Another was killed in the
West Bank.
Mr Moshe Katsav, leader of Likud's parliamentary group, said there was a
direct link between the government's relatively conciliatory stance in the
peace talks and the rise in violence. But Mr Shimon Peres, foreign minister,
said only a political solution would end the violence.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Japan hints at rice ban compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN WILL not allow its ban on rice imports to stand in the way of
successful completion of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, Mr Kiichi
Miyazawa, prime minister, made clear this weekend.
'We must never spoil multinational trade talks,' he said, after reshuffling
his cabinet on Friday.
Mr Michio Watanabe, foreign minister, reinforced Mr Miyazawa's comments,
saying: 'Unless the government makes a decision on fundamental principles
about the rice issue within this year or by early next year, the Round will
not be completed successfully.'
Mr Miyazawa's indication that he would be prepared for Japan to replace its
ban on rice imports with a set of import tariffs marks an important change
in the government's public approach to an issue which has become a central
obstacle to completing the Gatt trade talks.
Until last week the government had insisted that it would not compromise on
its demand that the rice ban be excluded from proposals made by Mr Arthur
Dunkel, Gatt director general, that all import restrictions should be
replaced by tariffs.
However, Mr Miyazawa's comments suggest he is seeking to capitalise on the
political momentum of the reshuffle to swing policy towards a compromise.
The move is likely to provoke a storm of protest from Japan's rice farmers
who form an important part of the governing Liberal Democratic party's rural
support.
Government officials indicated that a final decision on how to replace the
ban with a set of tariffs would be taken by early in the new year. The focus
will shift to whether the government can reach a compromise with the farmers
over measures to offset the competition from imports.
It is thought likely that Japan will press for tariffs as high as 700 per
cent and for them to be subsequently reduced more slowly than under the
current Dunkel schedule.
Mr Miyazawa said the government would make sure farmers could continue to
work in security, possibly by providing financial assistance to promote the
rationalisation of agriculture to create larger more efficient farms.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Indonesia quake kills over 1,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT least 1,200 died at the weekend when an earthquake measuring 6.8 on the
Richter scale struck the island of Flores in eastern Indonesia.
Local government officials have appealed for emergency food and medical
supplies amid reports that thousands have been made homeless.
The earthquake, which occurred at midday local time on Saturday, had its
epicentre 30km north of Flores, creating a tidal wave reportedly 80 feet
high.
The wave devastated the coastal town of Maumere, killing more than 1,000
people and badly damaging at least a third of its buildings. The town has a
population of 70,000, and local government officials say the death toll
there is certain to rise as rescue work continues.
Two ships carrying emergency supplies have already been sent from the
neighbouring island of Timor, but the port and airport at Maumere were
reportedly damaged by the earthquake, and this is hampering relief efforts.
With the rainy season at its height, officials are concerned that disease
may spread rapidly.
The full extent of the disaster may take several days to emerge as relief
teams struggle to visit the plethora of smaller islands nearby.
Flores, with a 1.5m population, lies at the meeting point of two continental
shelves, as do many of Indonesia's 13,000 islands, and has a turbulent
volcanic past. It has more than a dozen active volcanoes.
In recent years, the island has become popular with tourists, largely
because of its rugged volcanic landscape and crater lakes. There were no
reports of foreigners being killed, although Maumere is a main port of entry
for travellers visiting Flores.
The earthquake is certain to revive environmentalists' opposition to plans
to construct a dozen nuclear power stations on the main island of Java,
which lies on the same geographical fault line as Flores.

<TEXT>
Mogadishu's main water supply plant was switched on yesterday - after a
three-month shutdown - under a United Nations deal that will give Somali
gunmen who were guarding it on-the-job training as plumbers and mechanics,
Reuter reports from Afgoi, Somalia.
Supplies will start reaching the capital in about 48 hours, where priority
will be given to hospitals, feeding centres for refugees and public
standpipes until fuller service is restored, said Mr Peter Schumann,
representative of the United Nations Development Programme.
Mr Schumann spent eight weeks negotiating a deal to reopen the plant, which
in essence involved convincing gunmen demanding a dollar ransom for not
looting it to accept on-the-job training instead.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The road from Edinburgh to Emu still looks bumpy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Edinburgh summit will be hailed as a triumph. But euphoria should be
contained. The journey to economic and monetary union may have not been
abandoned, but the road ahead will be bumpy.
The past three months have demonstrated how bumpy it can be. When the FT
last published a table on convergence, on December 9, 1991, many thought
that the ERM, which had operated without a significant realignment for
almost five years, offered a smooth road to Emu. Things look rather
different after the exit of the Italian lira and pound sterling and the
realignments of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo. Whether the French
franc retains its parity with the ERM is likely to prove more important for
Emu than anything agreed by the 12 leaders of the European Community over
the weekend.
It is the Bundesbank's determination to preserve the value of the D-Mark,
despite German unification, that has so shaken the ERM. But the Bundesbank
is not engaged in a quixotic tilt at inflationary windmills. Its goals are
shared by many Germans, as was demonstrated by the terms on which the
Bundestag ratified the Maastricht Treaty earlier this month. By insisting
that they be given another chance to examine Emu before signing away the
D-Mark, German politicians have warned others of their opposition to any
watering down of the convergence criteria.
The criteria in the Maastricht Treaty were that a country shall possess:
'an average nominal long-term interest rate that does not exceed by more
than 2 percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing member
states in terms of price stability'; and
an average rate of inflation 'that does not exceed by more than 1 1/2
percentage points that of, at most, the three best performing member
states';
a currency that 'shall have respected the normal fluctuation margins
provided for by the exchange rate mechanism of the EMS without severe
tensions for at least the last two years before the examination';
a sustainable government financial position. This is defined, first, by
'whether the ratio of the planned or actual government deficit to gross
domestic product exceeds' 3 per cent, 'unless either the ratio has declined
substantially and continuously and reached a level that comes close to' 3
per cent or 'the excess . . . is only exceptional and temporary', and,
second, by 'whether the ratio of government debt to GDP exceeds' 60 per
cent, 'unless the ratio is sufficiently diminishing and approaching' 60 per
cent 'at a satisfactory pace.'
What, if any, progress has the EC been making towards the convergence aim?
Eight countries meet the interest rate criterion, the same countries also
meeting the inflation criterion. The countries with the best inflation
performance in 1992 were Belgium, Denmark and France.
Only seven countries - the minimum number for Emu in 1997 - meet the ERM
criterion. But who knows how many more realignments may be forced on the
ERM?
Only France, Denmark and Luxembourg are forecast to meet the government
borrowing criterion next year (see chart). As for the target for government
debt, it is currently met by only five countries.
In sum, Luxembourg and France alone would pass all the tests for Emu. But
Germany and, intriguingly, Denmark are close enough to make the grade. Thus,
half the countries eligible for Emu do not want to join and one of the other
two, Luxembourg, is already in a currency union.
Ireland still fails on public debt; the UK now succeeds on inflation, but
fails on the fiscal deficit and ERM membership; Belgium and the Netherlands
fail on both aspects of fiscal policy; Spain fails on everything, apart from
the public debt ratio; and Greece, Italy, and Portugal fail on everything.
The economic significance of these criteria must not be exaggerated. They
are not logically necessary for a successful Emu. But Emu is a political
project. If German politicians want to be difficult, it looks as though they
will have plenty of excuses.

FT  14 DEC 92 / US Marines seize vital Somali airstrip: But confusion grows
about the tactics and objectives of the United Nations relief mission
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US MARINES in 12 helicopter gun ships yesterday seized a vital airstrip in
the starvation-ridden interior of Somalia, as the foreign intervention in
the country continued to build up.
However, with at least 36,000 troops due in Somalia by Christmas, confusion
has begun to set in about the tactics and objectives of the operation, which
has a United Nations mandate to provide security for relief efforts.
Yesterday morning, a rifle company of 220 Marines, flying from Mogadishu in
their first foray into the interior, landed and secured the former air force
base at Bali Dogle, 160km west of the capital. The Marines will pave the way
for the imminent arrival of the 10,000-strong US Army 10th Mountain
division.
In the capital, military officials said at least 3,500 US troops and 300
French paratroopers and 120 Belgian soldiers had already landed by last
night to form the advance forces of the biggest military-humanitarian
intervention ever undertaken in black Africa.
At the port, the Marines have offloaded 320 vehicles, including 7 M1-A1
Abrams tanks and several armoured personnel carriers, from a huge supply
ship, as part of the fleet which will penetrate further into the interior.
However, there is some confusion among the foreign troops who have secured
Mogadishu's port and airport and provided increased security in the anarchic
city, over whether they should be disarming the city's residents.
At first, US commanders gave orders for all weapons to be confiscated.
Later, only heavy weaponry and machine-guns used in an aggressive or
threatening way near checkpoints were ordered to be taken. Guns, which had
disappeared from vehicles and pedestrians after the US marines arrived last
week, are gradually re-appearing as bandit attacks continue unabated.
Tension was also mounting between French and US officers yesterday. The
paratroopers from the French Foreign Legion have long experience of
patrolling Africa's most violent streets and are anxious to be moved rapidly
into the interior. But they have put themselves under a US military command
which appears to be taking no chances and is refusing to heed the pleas of
aid workers that they move rapidly into the towns of Kismayo and Baidoa,
which have been plagued by looting.
US troops are expected to move to Baidoa in an armoured convoy by the
weekend. Baidoa is the critical staging point for the relief effort to the
cut-off interior.
However, aid workers continued to criticise the slow US penetration of the
interior, where there are at least 300 deaths a day and up to 2m Somalis are
in desperate need of food, medicine, seeds and tools. 'The operation is too
military and too little humanitarian so far,' said an official with Medicins
Sans Frontieres.
Foreign troops in Mogadishu have met little opposition from the freelance
gunmen and bandits who have terrorised civilians for two years. On Saturday,
however, Cobra combat helicopters fired anti-tank weapons at three Somali
battle wagons they said fired upon their aircraft, killing up to eight
people and injuring several. The wreckage of one burnt-out vehicle lay
abandoned yesterday and residents living near the scene of the incident said
the three destroyed vehicles, including a US-made M1-13 APC, had been
fighting a rival clan for control of a former military camp when the US
helicopters flew overhead on a routine patrol. US officials said they hoped
the incident would set an example.
A UN World Food Programme ship carrying 3,000 tonnes of bagged wheat docked
at Mogadishu port yesterday, the first aid ship into the city since October
24. US Marines also escorted a food convoy of 20 tonnes of rice, beans and
vegetable oil through south Mogadishu in the second day of US military-NGO
co-operation.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Clinton friend to head White House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BY common consensus, the best White House chiefs of staff in the past 20
years have been Richard Cheney in the Ford administration and James Baker,
in President Reagan's first term: the worst are considered to have been
Hamilton Jordan, who worked for President Carter, and John Sununu under
President Bush.
The first two were successful because of their native political skills,
their understanding of their presidents and administrations and a relative
self-effacement on the job.
The second pair fared less well because they were combative and were
sometimes contemptuous of Washington and its ways, and, in Mr Sununu's case,
ferociously ideological.
In choosing Thomas F McLarty, the Arkansas businessman whom he has known
since kindergarten, President-elect Bill Clinton has made it clear that he
wants in this sensitive position somebody he instinctively trusts and who is
more interested in pursuing the presidential agenda than any personal
crusade or self-publicity.
With 11 senior positions now in place, the Clinton administration is shaping
up as an interesting combination of the Washington and Wall Street
establishment mainstream on the one hand and a new breed of outside
activists on the other.
More than that, he expects them to work together in ways that the capital
has not seen for some time.
Ron Brown, named on Saturday to be the next Secretary of Commerce, is the
quintessential political insider.
The 51-year-old black lawyer's career has moved seamlessly from the civil
rights movement through the Urban League, the effective lobby for the
cities, and a stint as the Rev Jesse Jackson's right hand to a fabulously
successful four years as national Democratic party chairman.
His law firm represents any number of corporate and foreign clients,
including, at one stage, the Haiti of President Duvalier.
These connections may make his confirmation hearings tougher than most but
Mr Brown's ability to sail through apparent political and private conflicts
of interest is impressive.
Mr Clinton said he wanted the commerce department under Mr Brown to be a
'powerhouse' in Washington.
Partly because of its amorphous responsibilities and partly because it has
been traditionally used for pure political reward, this has not been its
reputation for many years.
But, in the Clinton administration, it will have a place on the new economic
advisory body to be chaired by the president himself and directed by Robert
Rubin, now the co-chairman of Goldman Sachs. So will another relative
backwater, the labour department, under Robert Reich, the Harvard professor.
Mr McLarty's appointment, in the opinion of many political observers, makes
more likely the selection of Mr Warren Christopher as secretary of state.
In an interview yesterday, Mr Christopher, former deputy secretary of state
and now transition team director, brushed off all such speculation, which is
based mostly on the fact that he was thought to have had the option of three
jobs, two of which have been otherwise earmarked: chief of the White House
staff and, though yet to be determined, attorney general.
It is also deemed significant that Mr Clinton has chosen his economic and
social policy teams first, thus fulfilling an essential promise of his
campaign.
On Friday, he took issue with a questioner who wondered why he had not first
named the four cabinet secretaries traditionally considered the most senior
 -state, defence, justice and treasury.
He was careful to add, however, that this did not imply a relegation of
foreign and security policies, which, he said, should be active and
pre-emptive so that his administration would not be 'swamped' by a
succession of demanding external crises.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Principality deserts Swiss lead with vote for EEA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VADUZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MOUSE roared in alpine Europe yesterday when the tiny principality of
Liechtenstein defied public opinion in neighbouring Switzerland and voted to
join the European Economic Area.
In traditional Ruritanian style, Mr Hans Brunhart, the prime minister,
offered a news conference dominated by Swiss journalists the joking pledge
that this would not mean border posts being put up on the country's eastern
Rhine frontier - 'at least not tomorrow.'
The outcome, nonetheless, was quite as surprising to many Liechtensteiners
as Switzerland's vote just a week earlier not to join the EEA, the free
trade accord widely seen as a waiting room for the European Community.
Most of Liechtenstein's political leaders had warned before the Swiss
plebiscite that - whatever its result - their country should follow their
neighbour's lead. But when the Swiss voted No, Vaduz was caught between
solidarity with Berne and its need to trade in a wider Europe to defend an
industrial base accounting for a remarkable 50 per cent of gross domestic
product. In the event, the outcome was decisive, with all 12 communes
obeying Prince Hans Adam II's impassioned entreaties for a Yes vote.
The overall majority was exactly 1,400 votes - a wafer in a UK constituency,
but a landslide in a country of just 30,000.
The consequences, nonetheless, may be significant for the 70-year-old
customs union with Switzerland. Hurried assurances were issued last night
that the vote will not materially affect relations with the Swiss nor
involve surrendering the mighty Swiss franc as Liechtenstein's national
currency.
The principality's businessmen and international bankers have also been
promised that there is no threat to its much-envied low-tax regime that has
helped make it the richest country in Europe in terms of GDP per capita.
Talks will open soon with Switzerland on how to adjust the terms of the
customs union to accommodate both sides.
Last night, the Prince was clearly jubilant at his subjects' independence of
spirit. But he insisted that the outcome was not so much a rejection of
Switzerland as a solid endorsement of closer trade ties with a wider Europe
that buys 45 per cent of Liechtenstein's manufactured exports.
Questioned on possible EC membership, the Prince rejected a membership
application as 'a step too far.'
That will come as a relief to the lightly-taxed drinkers celebrating or
drowning their sorrows last night in the Old Castle inn in downtown Vaduz.
Whatever their views they were united in a determination not to be drawn
into a system which might force them to bail out their, in comparative
terms, impoverished northern near-neighbours - the Germans.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Nafta urged as model for western trade pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE North American Free Trade Agreement should be used as a core around
which to build a western hemisphere free trade pact, an influential
Washington-based foreign policy group says.
The proposal is one of a series of recommendations in a report published
today by the Inter-American Dialogue of the Aspen Institute. The report from
the group, which includes prominent Democrats, is in part aimed at
influencing Clinton administration policy towards Latin America.
The report argues that a new multilateral organisation is needed to guide
and co-ordinate progress towards a western hemisphere economic community. In
the meantime, the Nafta partners - the US, Canada and Mexico - should begin
consultations to establish procedures for building Nafta into a hemispheric
free trade pact.
Chile would be a likely first candidate for membership.
Efforts should also be made to pave the way for the participation of the
smaller countries of central America and the Caribbean, which are likely to
suffer from Nafta.
Rejection of Nafta would, says the report, 'gut the core of future
hemisphere-wide trade arrangements'.
The report also proposes strengthened collective action among American
states to preserve democracy in the region and a forceful collective attack
on poverty and inequality.
It calls on external organisations to put financial, intellectual and
political muscle behind national anti-poverty programmes, with the World
Bank and the InterAmerican Development Bank committing at least one-third of
their Latin American lending to poverty reduction. It also urges governments
of the hemisphere to promote negotiated settlements of Latin America's
remaining guerrilla conflicts and to look at their armed forces, with the
objective of establishing firm civilian control over the military.

THE Russian government's senior western economic adviser is pressing the
future Clinton administration to champion a new multi-billion-dollar package
of foreign aid for Russia, to support a new attempt to stabilise the
country's finances and prepare for an expected surge in unemployment in the
coming year.
Mr Jeffrey Sachs, the Harvard University economist who is working closely
with the reform team under Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister, said
yesterday that preliminary talks with the Clinton transition team indicated
a willingness to grapple with what he described as 'the most important
foreign policy issue facing the US and the west.'
Mr Sachs' proposals would total roughly the same as the Dollars 24bn (Pounds
15.7bn) package put forward in the summer by the Group of Seven industrial
countries, which has so far had little effect on the crisis-ridden Russian
financial structure. One cornerstone of that package, an IMF standby
agreement, has been indefinitely postponed.
The package's main points are:
An emergency social fund to cover increased social spending from mass
redundancies, and to fund pensions and health care. This would be set up by
the G7 governments.
An industrial restructuring fund to convert the military goods sector and
re-equip obsolete but otherwise viable plants - to be administered by the
main export credit guarantee agencies, the World Bank and the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development.
A small business fund to supply capital and expertise to the growing private
sector. Measures, including debt rescheduling, a rouble stabilisation fund
and a balance of payments support package administered by the IMF.
The plan takes much of the authority for the assistance away from the IMF,
to which the G7 gave overall management of the Dollars 24bn package.
Mr Sachs, whose passionate advocacy has both irritated and spurred the IMF
and G7 governments, believes the Fund has been part victim, part villain in
a general foreign indifference to the looming problems of Russian reform.
Mr Sachs believes that lack of IMF/western decisiveness, especially in
offering a Dollars 6bn fund to stabilise the rouble at the beginning of
reforms in January, provoked the slide into higher and higher inflation and
budgetary deficits.
He says that, of the Dollars 24bn package, only Dollars 1bn from the IMF and
a Dollars 600m industrial rehabilitation loan from the World Bank has been
issued.

MUNICIPAL elections yesterday and today in 55 Italian cities and towns will
provide the first serious test of electoral opinion in the country since the
April general elections.
The main focus is on the towns of Monza and Varese in the Milan industrial
belt, where opinion polls show the populist Lombard League is likely to
consolidate its position as the main political party in northern Italy.
At the small town of Fiumicino, near Rome, the first trial cross-party
alliance is being tested with reformist elements of the Christian Democrat
Party headed by Mr Mario Segni, a progressive sector of the Socialist Party
loyal to Mr Claudio Martelli, justice minister, and sympathisers among the
former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS).
All the parties are in a state of flux, the main ascendant being the
anti-Rome Lombard League which has burst on the scene in the past 18 months
with limited funds but profiting from public disillusion with a corrupt
political establishment.
The extent of the slippage in support for the Christian Democrats and
Socialists will demonstrate how far the electorate has decided to desert
these two parties.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Military force sought over Serb flights
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL pressure for the use of force to implement the 'no-fly' zone
over Bosnia, imposed by the United Nations last October, was stepped up over
the weekend, with both the US and France calling for military measures
against Serbian aircraft violating the ban on flights.
Following the adoption of an unusually tough declaration condemning the
leadership of Serbia and the Bosnian Serbs by European Community leaders, Mr
Francois Mitterrand, the French president, said France would formally ask
the UN Security Council to authorise the enforcement of the zone. The
original Security Council prohibiting military flights over Bosnia did not
specify how the ban on flights would be enforced.
Mr Mitterrand's announcement followed a statement earlier on Saturday by Mr
Lawrence Eagleburger, the Secretary of State in the outgoing US
administration, that the US was now also ready to back the use of force
against Serbian aircraft. Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, joined Mr
Eagleburger in expressing over the weekend a hardening on the US position.
The decision has the backing of Mr Bill Clinton, the US president-elect, who
had spoken in favour of enforcement the previous day.
President Mitterrand went a step further than the declaration of the
European Council, which merely stated that the 12 leaders reaffirmed their
support for Security Council resolution 787, 'which provides for the
necessary measures, including military, to be taken to ensure the safe
delivery of humanitarian assistance.' But there can be little doubt that
opinion among other members of the Security Council, including Britain,
which has so far been very hesitant about the adoption of measures that
could endanger the lives of British troops of the UN contingent in Bosnia,
is swinging in favour of some kind of military action to prevent Serbian
aircraft from violating the UN ban.
In its declaration on the former Yugoslavia, the European Council accused
both the Serbian and Bosnian leadership of bearing 'the primary
responsibility' for the conflict 'and its brutality' in the region.
'In defiance of UN Security Council Resolutions, the Serb forces in
Bosnia-Hercegovina have undertaken a savage campaign of military aggression,
ethnic cleansing and the persecution and torture of civilians,' the EC
leaders said in their concluding document. 'Those responsible for all these
crimes against humanitarian law by the different sides will be held
personally accountable and brought to justice.'
The Council said that it would not accept the partition of
Bosnia-Hercegovina and strongly supported the efforts of the co-chairmen of
the Geneva peace conference, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, to achieve a
constitutional settlement which would recognise the multi-ethnic character
of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
It also called for more action to provide protection to the civilian
population.
The leaders stated firmly that the autonomy of the province of Kosovo within
Serbia must be restored and said that it was in favour of 'a UN presence' in
Kosovo.
In a separate declaration on the treatment of Moslem women in the former
Yugoslavia, the European leaders said they were 'appalled' by the systematic
detention and rape of Moslem women.

FT  14 DEC 92 / IMF may revoke membership of Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of the International Monetary Fund meet in Washington today to
consider revoking Yugoslavia's membership, opening the way for Croatia and
Slovenia to rejoin the IMF and its sister institution, the World Bank.
The move would call into question around Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.1bn) of
World Bank loans outstanding to the other Yugoslav republics, possibly
leading to a formal default for the first time in the Washington-based
development institution's history.
Discussions have been under way for some time over a legal formula that
would, in essence, declare that Yugoslavia no longer exists and that its IMF
membership has therefore lapsed. The World Bank would be obliged by its
rules to follow suit.
The republics could then be invited to reapply for membership, but under
conditions that would ensure that Serbia, viewed as the aggressor in the
civil war, would not qualify.
Croatia and Slovenia have accepted responsibility for their share of World
Bank loans made to Yugoslavia, although Serbia could repudiate its portion,
estimated at Dollars 1.5bn - roughly equivalent to a full year's net income
for the World Bank.
Bank officials say their exposure is already partially provisioned, but
acknowledge that if they had to provision their Serbian loans in full it
would cause a 'downward blip' in net income.
While the IMF has some credits outstanding to Yugoslavia, its exposure is
much smaller than the bank's, and some bank directors have questioned
whether their Fund colleagues are sufficiently sensitive to the financial
implications of ending Yugoslav membership.
But the twin political imperatives of, on the one hand, allowing Croatia and
Slovenia into the international financial community and, on the other,
drumming Serbia out, are likely to override these financial considerations.
The bank has already had to place Dollars 1.7bn of its total Dollars 2.02bn
loans outstanding to Yugoslavia - which includes the Serbian, Bosnian and
Macedonian shares - in 'non-accrual' status, which means they are not being
serviced, so repudiation would add little risk.
Counting Yugoslavia, the World Bank has around Dollars 3.8bn of loans in
non-accrual status, nearly 4 per cent of its outstanding loan portfolio. Its
provisions at the end of its financial year amounted to Dollars 2.54bn, or
around 2.5 per cent of outstanding loans.
Some industrial member countries have argued that this provision ratio is
inadequate, and Mr Denis Desautels, Canada's auditor general, last month
joined this criticism.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The European Market: German investors tax the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACCORDING to cliche, Germans stick to the rules. When it comes to tax
affairs, however, they are compulsive rule-breakers.
Only a desire to get round the law can explain the massive flow of German
funds into Luxembourg and other tax havens before next month's introduction
of a 30 per cent tax on interest income.
There is nothing illegal about shifting funds to Luxembourg - so long as the
income on those investments is subsequently declared to the tax authorities.
But it seems many Germans have no intention of declaring this income. Mr
Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making council,
made this clear in a speech last month, when he condemned the outflows as a
form of 'money-laundering'.
He said the amount of money likely to leave Germany by the end of the year
would exceed the sum which departed in 1988-89.
Then, Germany's financial markets and the D-Mark were disturbed by a cash
exodus before the introduction of a 10 per cent withholding tax on interest
income.
In the first nine months of this year, Germans invested DM31bn in Luxembourg
funds managed by German banks, and only DM4bn in domestic funds.
Dresdner Bank's investment subsidiary recently reported that funds under
management in Luxembourg have trebled to DM14bn since the beginning of the
year. At Deutsche Bank, Luxembourg funds have nearly doubled to DM27bn.
These figures understate the overall outflows. They do not include money
deposited with non-German institutions in Luxembourg - or cash transferred
across other frontiers, to Switzerland or Austria, for example.
Frankfurt economists estimate that the total outflow for the year could be
about DM100bn, compared with DM72bn which left the country in 1989.
The flow of money worries the Bundesbank. It has contributed to extra demand
for banknotes, as Germans have cashed in their investments and driven across
the border to Luxembourg to buy securities there.
'It is entirely normal for someone to walk into our branch here with
DM50,000 or DM300,000 in cash,' says the head of the Luxembourg subsidiary
of one German bank.
The increase in cash in circulation has been one factor behind the sharp
growth in money supply, now growing at an annualised rate of more than 10
per cent.
The transfers are also of concern for the German government, keen to
increase its tax revenues so as to reduce its budget deficit.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has aimed a number of verbal
fusillades at the banks, accusing them of publishing misleading advertising
for their Luxembourg operations.
The new tax is designed to avoid the problems associated with the original
10 per cent withholding tax introduced at the beginning of 1989. This tax
drove foreign investors away from the German markets and was abolished a few
months after it was introduced because of the damage it was doing to
Germany's status as a financial centre. The German constitutional court in
Karlsruhe subsequently ruled that a replacement tax would have to be
implemented.
This time, foreign investors are excluded, and most domestic taxpayers will
not have to pay any tax either.
Individuals earning interest of DM6,000 or less, and married couples earning
DM12,000 or less, will be excluded from the tax.
It is thought that only the wealthiest 20 per cent of the population will be
affected. Assuming interest rates of 6 per cent, a married couple must have
savings of over DM200,000 before they become liable for any tax.
Many people however seem to be moving their funds although their income is
below the tax threshold. One factor may be the banks' advertising which - as
Mr Waigel has complained - tends to give the impression that everyone would
be better off investing in Luxembourg.
Another reason is that people are seeking to avoid tax on income which
should have been declared years ago. The new tax is deducted at source. For
investors to receive a rebate if their income falls below the threshold,
they must first declare it to the tax authorities.
'If you have hidden your capital for the last five years, you have to
continue to hide it,' says one Luxembourg banker. 'If you suddenly put it in
your income tax declaration, the tax officer will obviously ask where it
came from. You will end up being taxed retroactively.'
'It is fair to say that taxes have never been paid on the funds which are
flowing now,' says Mr Pierre Jaans, director general of the Luxemburg
Monetary Institute, the Grand Duchy's equivalent to a central bank.
Mr Jaans says Luxembourg would be willing to participate in a pan-European
harmonisation of tax systems, which could help prevent such large capital
transfers in future. Since the chances of this happening are fairly remote,
the D-Marks will presumably carry on taking the road to Luxembourg.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Treaty may leak through loopholes -
Maastricht doubts have not been resolved
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BY contrast with earlier predictions of apocalyptic failure, the British
government can claim to be reasonably satisfied with the way it managed the
summit negotiations.
The Danish problem was settled after a fashion, a pragmatic compromise was
hammered out on expanding future Community budgets, and limits were placed
on future Community legislation, in the name of the much-derided principle
of 'subsidiarity'.
Ahead of the summit, Britain had been castigated for its 'calamitous'
presidency of the Council; but other member states have gracefully shifted
from vituperation to compliments, and even forbore to insist on any new
deadline for British ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
Yet the Edinburgh meeting has been an essentially inconclusive affair. A
year ago the 12 were in various states of euphoria over the completion of
negotiations on the Maastricht Treaty of European Union. Today the future
and even the status of that treaty are in doubt, and these doubts have not
been resolved by this weekend's summit meeting.
The two central features of the treaty are a programme for Economic and
Monetary Union, and a commitment to a common foreign and security policy,
but both of them are now seriously in doubt. Since the monetary upheavals of
this autumn, it is hard to believe that the Emu programme is feasible in the
terms laid down by the treaty. In the light of events in ex-Yugoslavia, the
claims of a common European foreign policy look derisory.
The most pressing question was the Danish conundrum: how to give the Danes a
series of opt-outs from the treaty, in a form that was sufficiently 'legally
binding' to enable them to hold a second referendum, but not so legally
binding as to require a new round of ratification in the other member
states. That circle now appears to have been squared through the ingenious
inventiveness of the Community's lawyers.
And yet everyone knows that circles cannot really be squared. Appearances
have been saved by the Danish deal, but the real result has been to void the
Maastricht treaty of a little more of its content.
The British government may nevertheless believe that the cumulative effect
of the Edinburgh package can be seen as a significant double victory for its
vision of a Community which is larger, looser and less integrated. The first
half of that victory is the Danish deal: if Denmark can be allowed a
comprehensive opt-out from most of the main objectives of Maastricht, those
objectives cannot really be binding on the other member states.
But the second half may seem just as significant, and that is the decision
to open membership negotiations with the candidate countries from the
European Free Trade Area. Britain would always have preferred a larger but
looser Community, ideally nothing more than an inter-governmental free-trade
area; so the combination of a deal which weakens the Maastricht treaty, and
a decision to open the Community to a significant number of new members,
looks very much like a setback for countries like France, which were
demanding a 'deeper' and more integrated Community.
However, it may be premature to claim a final victory in the long-running
battle between the wideners and the deepeners. The wideners have won a
skirmish, with the decision to open negotiations on the enlargement of the
Community, even before the Maastricht treaty is ratified by all 12 member
states. But these negotiations will compel the 12 to debate how a larger
Community is to be governed and how it is to take decisions.
By definition, the 12 will have to choose between a Community which will be
hamstrung by swollen numbers, or one which must accept more majority voting
for the sake of effectiveness. They will have to consider whether the
universalist model of European integration can be maintained with a larger
number of member states, or whether it will be necessary to go towards a
multi-speed Europe.
And they must consider whether a large Community can continue to give a
large voting premium to small member states.
In other words, the prospective enlargement of the Community will compel the
12 to confront constitutional issues which remained largely suppressed or
shelved in the Maastricht treaty. This will not be an attractive agenda for
the inter-governmentalists; and yet on certain aspects of this enlargement
agenda, for example the relative voting weights of large and small
countries, Britain, as a large country, could have a position similar to
that of the deepeners. This is just one of the ironies of the integration
game.
The paradox is that these negotiations will require the prospective member
states to swear their firm commitment to all the obligations of the European
Community as modified by the Maastricht treaty; but they will be conducted
under the presidency of Denmark, which has just been offered a comprehensive
opt-out from these very obligations. There is no easy way of avoiding this
charade; but it cannot fail to cast a certain disrepute on the treaty
process.
Some people profess to believe that the four or five applicants from Efta
can be admitted without a serious federal-intergovernmental argument.
Subsequent phases of enlargement to 25 or 30 member states would call for
far-reaching revision of the Community's rulebook; but this first little
enlargement would not require any significant reduction in the voting
premium accorded under present rules to the small member states.
The navete of this position will not stand up to the pressure of reality;
the terms of this enlargement will automatically dictate the terms of
subsequent enlargements. In a Community of 16 or 17, the small countries
would be in a massive numerical majority, with half the weighted votes but
with only a quarter of the population.
Everybody knows that this weighting discrepancy will either be rectified
before the Efta enlargement, or it will never be rectified. Since the
question cannot be postponed to some easier time, it will be addressed,
implicitly or explicitly, during the course of the Efta enlargement
negotiations.
The same logic will require a thorough review of the constitutional issues
in the Maastricht treaty. The treaty itself calls for a special
inter-governmental review conference in 1996. The conventional hypocrisy is
that this review should take place after the admission of new members.
No-one seems to acknowledge that it is an extraordinary idea that new
members, who have spent 40 years refusing to join the Community, should be
voting on the revision of the Maastricht treaty within weeks of their
admission to full membership. The logical inference is that the 12 will have
to hold their Maastricht review before they admit new members from Efta.
Moreover, there will be one serious policy embarrassment in the admission of
members from Efta. The Danes may be desperate to back out of the commitment
to a common foreign and security policy, including eventually a defence
policy. But some candidate countries, like Finland and Sweden, are keen to
take on these new aspects of the Community, and will eagerly seek to join
the Western European Union defence grouping.
Here lies the rub. The WEU treaty includes a far-reaching mutual security
guarantee, but it does not have any military organisation; all that has long
since been delegated to Nato. The natural assumption is that the new
arrivals should also join Nato; and yet it is virtually inconceivable that
Washington would agree to an extension of its nuclear security guarantees,
just when it is shrinking its military presence in Europe.
So if the new Community members seriously claim the protection of WEU, the
existing member states will have to consider whether WEU is to be endowed
with real military capability; which would mean a military organisation
distinct from Nato and therefore separate from the US.
It is possible, of course, that none of these questions will be put to the
test. The Swiss have already voted against the European Economic Area, which
would be an ante-chamber to full membership; and opinion polls suggest that
a majority of the Finns, the Norwegians and the Swedes are opposed to full
membership. But perhaps they will change their minds, when they see that the
Danish deal means that joining the Community does not really mean anything
much after all.

NORDIC governments welcomed the decision to start the process of EC
enlargement early in the new year. Formal negotiations are expected to begin
with Sweden, Austria and Finland by the end of January and with Norway
within a few months.
'The outcome of Edinburgh strengthens our chances of becoming a member of
the European Union in January 1995,' Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's prime minister,
said yesterday.
His trade minister, Mr Ulf Dinkenspiel, who will lead Sweden's negotiation,
added: 'Conditions have improved radically. . . . We will have entry terms
in good time to put to a referendum in 1994.'
However, a poll published yesterday indicated that as many as 50 per cent of
Swedes oppose membership, with 33 per cent in favour and 17 per cent
uncommitted. Strongest hostility was among people aged 16-29 and blue-collar
workers.
Opinion remains more favourable in Finland, where a majority back
membership. But in Norway attitudes are hardening strongly against EC entry.
In the latest survey 54 per cent said No and only 30 per cent Yes.

GREECE has temporarily succeeded in blocking European Community recognition
of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, but the problem remains on the
agenda of foreign ministers.
The concluding declaration of the Council on Macedonia was variously
interpreted as being a victory for the Greek position or merely a
postponement of a particularly delicate decision which could have scuttled
the whole conference.
If other member countries had insisted on recognising Macedonia under that
name, Greece could have blocked approval of all the other important
decisions taken by the heads of government, including those on Denmark and
the future financing of the Community. Unanimity remains the rule for
European Councils.
Though Mr Constantine Mitsotakis said after the meeting that the EC would
continue to be bound by 'the united policy' proclaimed in last June's Lisbon
declaration, which stated that the former Yugoslav republic would be
recognised only under a name other than Macedonia, the Council's statement
on the subject was more ambiguously worded.
The special representative, Mr Robin O'Neill, a former British ambassador,
had suggested various compromise proposals acceptable to the republic's
president Kiro Gligorov, including naming the new state 'the Republic of
Macedonia (Skopje)', to distinguish it from the northern Greek province of
Macedonia.
The Greeks claim that to call the new state Macedonia would provoke ethnic
conflict in the region, particularly by encouraging territorial claims on
the neighbouring Greek province.
Though Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, said no participant
had challenged the Lisbon declaration, Mr Hans van den Broek, his Dutch
opposite number, said the summit decision to give Macedonia economic aid and
the despatch of United Nations military observers there provided the basis
for further discussions about recognition.
It was agreed that the Community would provide Ecu100m (Pounds 80m) of
humanitarian and technical assistance to Macedonia, half of which would be
provided by the European Commission out of common funds and a matching
amount from member states.
Macedonians said yesterday they were deeply disappointed, but not surprised,
by the EC's failure to recognise their republic, Laura Silber writes from
Skopje.
Government officials, however, said they were pinning their hopes on the UN.
The UN Security Council is due to consider recognition this week.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Bonfire of Brussels laws fails to
catch light - Subsidiarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST before the Edinburgh summit, a European Commission official said he
expected the EC would be able to agree 'a text sufficiently meaningless to
everyone' on subsidiarity, to get through the artificially pumped-up debate
on how to divide power between the Community and the member states.
He was broadly right. The conclusions on 'subsidiarity' are modest. There
will be no rolling back of Community activity and the Commission retains its
sole right to propose legislation. Instead, there will be a greater onus on
the Commission, on national ministers, and on Euro-MPs to demonstrate that
action at EC level is in response to real needs in the member states.
The European institutions will have to show that their supranational plans
have added value for EC members, and that the means required to implement
them are proportional to the desired end. They will also have to ensure the
widest possible scope for national decision-making and to consult more
broadly before proceeding, through means such as green papers.
To open up decision-making to greater public scrutiny, important policy
debates and 'major new legislative proposals' will be televised for the
press. But, as now, the real negotiating process will still be shielded from
view. The record of all formal votes in the Council of Ministers will be
published, with member states explaining their decisions if they so wish.
But already ministers go to great lengths to avoid embarrassing any of their
number through formal votes, so this measure is unlikely to make the defence
of national and vested interest more visible.
For the moment, the balance of power within the 'ever-closer union'
postulated by Maastricht has not changed.
The bonfire of 71 items of EC law and Commission proposals sought by the UK
became a damp squib. Laws will be updated, to make them less intrusive and
easier to implement nationally or locally. But the Commission is withdrawing
a mere score of planned measures, some so arcane that officials could not be
found to explain what they were.
At a later date, an 'inter-institutional accord' between the Commission, the
European parliament and the Council of Ministers will make clear that all
power is vested in the member states except where otherwise specified. This
essentially federalist principle is implicit in both the Treaty of Rome and
the Maastricht treaty.
What was reaffirmed at Edinburgh was the EC's political preference for
decision-making at national, and in most cases, regional, level, combined
with its need for some decisions to be taken at supranational, Community
level. In a word, federalism - at least as most Community members understand
it.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Legalistic acrobatics rescue Denmark -
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE smile on Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's face could easily have spanned the
Firth of Forth.
'Denmark is satisfied,' the Danish foreign minister declared. After five
months of hard bargaining, Mr Ellemann-Jensen was visibly relieved that EC
leaders had agreed to meet Danish demands for legally binding opt-outs on
the Maastricht treaty.
The deal reached at the Edinburgh summit paves the way for the minority
government in Denmark to submit a new text to voters in a second referendum
on Maastricht in late April or early May - to be followed by ratification by
the Community straggler, Britain.
On Saturday, Mr Ellemann-Jensen predicted a 60 per cent vote in favour - a
forecast which drew polite gasps in the light of his government's failure to
predict the treaty's rejection in last June's referendum. His figure was
backed up, however, by a Gallup opinion poll, on a sample of 700 people,
showing 54 per cent in favour, compared with 23 per cent against and 23 per
cent undecided. The survey was conducted yesterday before seven of the eight
parties in the Folketing backed the Edinburgh deal.
The final agreement is an exercise in legal and constitutional acrobatics
which comes down to one crude political goal: how to keep Denmark inside the
EC without watering down the Maastricht treaty to the point where its
provisions are meaningless.
The new text walks a fine line in its effort to meet Denmark's requests for
legally binding exemptions without re-opening the treaty or producing a text
requiring re-ratification by member states.
Denmark strengthens its previously won right to avoid signing up to the
third stage of European monetary union and a single currency, the core goal
of the Maastricht treaty.
The leaders note that nothing in Maastricht commits Denmark to become a
member of the West European Union. 'Accordingly, Denmark does not
participate in the elaboration and the implementation of the Union which
have defence implications.'
Denmark has won legally binding exemptions from measures on EC citizenship
and EC co-operation on justice and home affairs matters.
The drafting involves a 'decision' by heads of government which has the
force of international law with a unilateral Danish political 'declaration'
which restates its opposition to join in citizenship of the 'European Union'
envisaged under Maastricht.
In return, Denmark has agreed not to exploit its opt-outs to prevent the
other EC members from pressing ahead with the objectives of Maastricht.
Similarly, in an effort to limit the political damage, member states have
declared that the opt-outs are only in response to the failure of the treaty
in the first referendum. These exemptions are 'fully compatible' with the
treaty.
Few EC leaders in Edinburgh were prepared to argue the legal niceties of the
Danish deal, though Mr Major admitted on Saturday that it could not be
tested in the European Court of Justice.
The agreement was welcomed by business leaders in Denmark and greeted by
newspaper headlines in Copenhagen such as 'Triumph for Denmark' and 'Europe
Gave Way'.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Pivotal role for headmaster Kohl -
Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, adopts at European summits the air of
a convivial headmaster shooing a class of errant schoolboys into line. One
senior British diplomat calls Mr Kohl's relationship with his host at
Edinburgh, Mr John Major, 'avuncular'. 'It's a bit like a football manager
who's seen a favourite player come good,' the diplomat adds.
Mr Kohl played a pivotal role in Edinburgh in several ways. First, and most
important, he backed key elements of Mr Major's policy - just as he had done
at Maastricht a year ago, when his support allowed Britain its 'opt-outs' in
monetary union and social policy.
Mr Kohl's willingness to allow Mr Major time to overcome ratification
hurdles in the House of Commons was already clearly expressed when the two
leaders met in Oxfordshire last month. Although the chancellor does not want
to give the UK unlimited leeway, he accepts that a formal deadline would
stoke up rather than diminish parliamentary opposition.
He is confident that Mr Major will be able to put the Maastricht bill on
course for full ratification by the summer - even though the closing stages
of passage through the House of Lords and the royal assent may not be
completed until later.
Mr Kohl repeated several times that he could not wait 'for years' for the
Maastricht laggards to ratify. But he showed no enthusiasm for the rest of
Europe leaving Denmark and Britain behind. He also stressed that the start
of enlargement negotiations with Sweden and Finland next month would boost
pro-EC feeling in neighbouring Denmark as campaigning for the new Maastricht
referendum there gets under way in the new year.
In another crucial area, Mr Kohl backed Mr Major's insistence that Britain's
EC budget rebate, negotiated in 1984 and worth about Pounds 2bn a year,
should not be renegotiated. Mr Major's Maastricht ratification difficulties
made it 'a favourable time' for Britain to encourage its partners not to
spark a new EC row over the rebate, Mr Kohl remarked whimsically on Friday
night.
Mr Kohl's personal links with other EC leaders came to the fore during
Saturday's late-night argument with Spain over the share of the Community
budget channelled to the poorer countries. Mr Kohl said he had made 'a
substantial verbal contribution' to try to calm the row with Mr Felipe
Gonzalez. On Friday Mr Kohl disarmingly said that he regarded himself as a
friend of the Spanish prime minister, but none the less could not explain Mr
Gonzalez's summit outbursts over the cohesion fund.
Over the question of economic and monetary union, Mr Kohl showed himself in
no hurry over a decision on the site for the proposed European central bank
 -an institution Germany badly wants in Bonn or Frankfurt. Before the
negotiations, German officials said they did not expect the matter to be
agreed in Edinburgh. Mr Kohl said the question could perfectly well be
settled next summer.
He believes the question of when the site of the institution is decided is
secondary - as long as, in the end, it is in Germany.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Major will try to build on success -
Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are no easy triumphs on offer in Europe for Mr John Major. Until
Britain has ratified the Maastricht treaty, the prime minister will be
unable to dispel the suspicion of his continental colleagues that he remains
a reluctant participant in the European enterprise.
But it would be churlish to suggest that the summit was anything but a
personal success. After the chaos and confusion of recent months, Mr Major
could claim with justice that his government - and the Community  - had
begun to regain their balance.
Mr Major deserves much of the credit. The basic impetus for the deals struck
at Edinburgh was a recognition by all 12 leaders that the price of failure
was too high. But the prime minister provided the skilful chairmanship which
allowed each delegation to dress up collective compromises as individual
successes.
Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, described Mr Major's handling
of the summit as 'elegant and effective'. Mr Albert Reynolds, the Irish
premier, offered a similar judgment. Even President Francois Mitterrand
allowed himself a grudging compliment.
Mr Major intends to capitalise on the plaudits - and on the substantive
deals struck in Edinburgh. Doubts over Maastricht and Black Wednesday handed
the initiative to the Tory Euro-sceptics. Now Mr Major thinks he can regain
it.
The balance sheet he will present to the Commons later today will list a
string of successes for his brand of pragmatic Europeanism.
British ingenuity ensured that Denmark had another opportunity to move
forward with the rest of the Community. The declaration on subsidiarity met
demands that Brussels give substance to the commitment to decentralise
authority.
All 12 governments are pledged to push ahead with negotiations to enlarge
the Community, initially to include Austria, Finland and Sweden. Mr Major
defended successfully the British budget rebate. With the eventual help of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, he resisted demands that he set a firm timetable for
ratification of Maastricht at Westminster. He found time also to settle
long-standing disputes over the sites of the EC's main institutions and to
give Germany extra European MPs to reflect unification.
The balance sheet carries its minuses also. The Tory sceptics seized
yesterday on the concessions which he was forced to give on the size of the
budget. They will make much of the concession to Brussels 'profligacy'
during the interminable New Year debates at Westminster on Maastricht.
For many other European leaders subsidiarity is a useful but essentially
unimportant concept. Negotiations on enlargement may begin before Maastricht
is ratified but progress remains contingent on the treaty coming into force.
On the admission of some of the participants the economic initiative drawn
up by the finance ministers will do little to dispel the gloom over European
growth prospects.
There was no doubt though that Edinburgh was a summit shaped much more by Mr
Major's pragmatism than by the European idealism of Mr Mitterrand or Mr
Kohl. That will give the prime minister a powerful weapon in his attempts to
detach from the irreconciliable Tory critics of Maastricht a much larger
group of waverers.
His message now to his party will be simple: the great mass of the
Conservative party wants a decentralised, wider, Community with the
bureaucratic wings of Brussels clipped. He can deliver it. The Tory doubters
in return must ensure that Britain retains its voice in Europe by ratifying
the treaty.
If the Danish people vote Yes in a second referendum the message will be
unanswerable. The Maastricht treaty could well be on the British statute
book by the end of July.
Mr Major's problem is that all-important 'if'. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, acknowledged that the government would abandon ratification in
the wake of a second Danish No vote. He accepted also that the other 10
probably would push ahead with a new version of the treaty from which
Britain as well as Denmark might be excluded. The uncomfortable implication
is that Britain's future in Europe for moment may rest with the tiny Danish
electorate.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Spain 'first, first, first' but others
do well too - Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the word 'handbag' was mentioned at Mr Felipe Gonzalez's end-of-summit
press conference, the Spanish premier and his ministers roared with
approving laughter at this comparison with Mrs Margaret Thatcher's 1984 feat
in extracting an EC budget rebate for the UK.
Not since then has a member state so successfully held the Community to
ransom, and Mr Gonzalez was not shy about proclaiming his achievement, or
about having put Spain's national interests 'first, first and first', as one
of his officials candidly expressed it.
Mr Gonzalez pointed out that 'for Spain there will be a doubling' of the
development aid all poorer member states get through EC 'cohesion' policy -
contributions to the Community budget from the rich north and centre of the
EC which are transferred to the south and the periphery.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, the Community's main paymaster, described
the outcome as 'a solid compromise. . . between the poor and the developed
countries.'
It is no exaggeration to say that the future of the European Community hung
on this compromise. Mr Gonzalez and his allies from Ireland, Portugal and
Greece had demanded budgetary satisfaction as their price for endorsing the
Danish opt-outs from Maastricht which are essential for all the 12 to be
able to ratify the treaty.
Yet, as Mr Gonzalez acknowledged, the new budget package is, overall, tight
when measured against the ambitions of Maastricht, and the interpretation of
them by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president.
Overall, the EC budget will rise from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) now to
Ecu84.1bn in 1999, in today's money. The budgetary ceiling, expressed as a
portion of joint EC gross national product, will rise from 1.2 per cent now
to 1.27 per cent in 1999.
Mr Delors had originally proposed a rise to 1.37 per cent over five years,
or an increase to Ecu87.5bn by 1997. He compromised last month, suggesting a
rise to Ecu86.2bn over seven years. But Mr John Major, after first refusing
any change in the ceiling, had insisted on holding the line at 1.25 per
cent, which would have allowed Ecu79.4bn spending in 1999.
Total 'structural' spending is to rise from Ecu18.6bn now to Ecu30bn in
1999. The main increase will be in the Structural Funds, which rise to
Ecu27.4bn in 1999, and second, the new Cohesion Fund created by the
Maastricht treaty, which will by then make up the Ecu2.6bn balance. This new
fund is solely for Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece, as their per capita
income is less than 90 per cent of the EC average, and is to help them meet
EC environmental standards and fill in the 'missing links' in pan-European
transport networks.
Germany also gets a saleable deal. There is unlikely to be any net increase
in its huge Ecu9bn net contribution to the budget. Mr Horst Kohler, the
German state secretary for finance, pointed out that new eastern states
would get treatment equal to that of the cohesion countries, worth some
DM13bn (Pounds 5.3bn) over seven years - something of a rebate for Germany.
The UK rebate, worth some Pounds 2bn a year but hotly contested by Mr Kohl,
was left intact.
The unpopular French government also got a discreet political fillip from
its partners, opening the way to compensation for French farmers now up in
arms about the Uruguay Round farm trade deal. There is to be no formal
relaxing of farm spending limits, which will rise as foreseen from Ecu35.3bn
now to Ecu38.4bn in 1999.
It is 'internal policies' - on the environment, transport, R&amp;D and
infrastructure - which suffered most from the success of Spain and its
allies in prying loose the most from a tight Community wad.
These policies are the bread-and-butter of the EC's recent expansion of its
competence. The UK, which prefers loose co-operation between governments to
Community action stimulated in Brussels, well knew that it was the latter
which would be squeezed most when it decided to be parsimonious on EC
finance. Spain was not the only victor of the compromise.

FT  14 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Weak response to bleak economic
outlook - Growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE economic recovery initiative at the summit may, with luck, add a little
to EC growth next year.
But the package, which EC leaders hope will support investment of more than
Ecu30bn (Pounds 24bn) through new Community loans and guarantees, falls far
short of addressing the EC's real economic problems and is unlikely to
prevent further rises in unemployment.
At Edinburgh, neither the leaders nor their finance ministers tackled
seriously the issue of Germany's deficit financing of eastern Germany and
the current problems of the European Monetary System. Yet it is Germany's
inability to reduce rapidly its dependence on borrowing for the new Lander
that transmits high short-term interest rates to the other members of the
European exchange rate mechanism and has contributed to recent strains in
the European Monetary System.
The EC package skirts round these fundamental problems. Instead member
states are encouraged to manage their economies more efficiently in the hope
that this will encourage investment. They are urged, where possible, to
divert public spending to infrastructure and capital projects away from
current spending such as wages.
At Community level, these efforts are to be topped up by the mobilisation of
new funds through the European Investment Bank (EIB) and a new European
Investment Fund (EIF) with the aim of supporting investments of Ecu30bn or
more over the next few years.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK Chancellor, said the two funds 'were important and
imaginative initiatives that involved very substantial amounts of money that
would lead to more investment.'
The EIF will be capitalised at Ecu2bn, to be subscribed 40 per cent by the
EIB, 30 per cent by the Commission and 30 per cent by financial
institutions. This capital will enable it to give guarantees worth between
Ecu5bn and Ecu10bn for projects to be carried out with other organisations.
These projects, which could include investment in small and medium sized
companies as well as infrastructure spending, could, the EC leaders hope, be
worth up to Ecu20bn.
In addition, the EIB will create a new 'lending facility' that will allow it
to extend credits totalling Ecu5bn to co-finance infrastructure investment
in the Community in 1993 and 1994. According to Mr Henning Christophersen,
the economic affairs commissioner, the money will be used largely to finance
'missing links' in the EC's transport system.
These will include improved cross-border motorway, rail and gas pipeline
links inside the EC. The EIB may also use the funds to finance projects in
central and eastern Europe, perhaps jointly with the London-based European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Mr Christophersen said the Ecu5bn in loans could support projects worth
Ecu12bn. Mr Lamont was more cautious, putting the likely investment at
Pounds 7bn or Ecu8.5bn.
To allow the EIB to operate more flexibly, the summit agreed that it will be
able to use the new facility to provide a maximum of 75 per cent of planned
financing for projects compared with its normal participation ceiling of 50
per cent. The combined loan and grant ceiling for projects with a grant
element will be raised to 90 per cent from 70 per cent.
The growth initiative was the summit's response to an increasingly bleak
economic outlook in the EC. Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, had told
fellow leaders that the meeting had to make its relevance clear to the
people of Europe by focusing on jobs and growth.
Mr Christophersen said growth next year was unlikely to be much more than 1
per cent after 1.1 per cent to 1.2 per cent this year. EC unemployment, at a
around 11 per cent next year, would be back at the levels of the mid-1980s,
he said. Capacity utilisation in industry was only 79 per cent. Inflation
was falling, but not sufficiently to pave the way for a decline in interest
rates.
National measures, including wage restraint, could make an important
contribution to lowering borrowing costs, he said. But lower interest rates
were not sufficient in themselves to boost investment. Many companies and
consumers were caught in a debt trap. For that reason, the Community had
decided on its growth initiative.
The new facilities, which should be ready to start operating in about six
months' time, will be flanked by increased spending on poorer EC countries
through the so-called cohesion funds agreed at the summit. The EC also
intends to improve the management and efficiency of its research funding and
place more emphasis on training.
Mr Christophersen also stressed the importance of completing the single
market, progressing with deregulation and privatisation, speeding up the
approval of common norms and standards and introducing tax incentives for
investment.
In their final statement, the leaders ruled out any large-scale fiscal boost
by reaffirming their determination to fulfil the tough economic convergence
criteria in the Maastricht treaty.
Although some member states - notably Germany - had approached the idea of a
growth initiative with scepticism, the summit communique said the leaders
were 'convinced' that the measures would boost confidence and growth and
create jobs.
However, Mr Christophersen indicated that the loan and guarantee package
would not make up for a recession-induced shortfall of investment in the EC,
which he estimated at about Ecu40bn next year.
The success of the package will depend on how far companies, organisations
and governments link up with the EIB and EIF to exploit the new loans and
guarantees. The commissioner said many EC transport projects had been
identified which could profit from the schemes and also suggested that there
could be a positive 'announcement effect' from the summit.
But such optimism could not disguise the age old problem with such projects.
Measures such as the EIF and special EIB facility are meant to create
confidence. But they can only boost the economy if there is sufficient
confidence among investors to want to use such facilities in the first
place.

Greece had demanded budgetary satisfaction as their price for endorsing the
Danish opt-outs from Maastricht which are essential for all the 12 to be
able to ratify the treaty. And next year's enlargement negotiations on EC
entry for Austria, Sweden, Finland, and eventually Norway would not have won
their sanction without agreement on future financing.
Yet, as Mr Gonzalez acknowledged, the new budget package is, overall, tight
when measured against the ambitions of Maastricht, and the interpretation of
them by Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president.
Overall, the EC budget will rise from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) now to
Ecu84.1bn in 1999, in today's money. The budgetary ceiling, expressed as a
portion of joint EC gross national product, will rise from 1.2 per cent now
to 1.27 per cent in 1999. The cash increase will be greater over the seven
years than this lifted limit suggests, because this year's spending - at
around 1.14 per cent of EC GNP - still has 'headroom' under the ceiling.
Mr Delors had originally proposed a rise to 1.37 per cent over five years,
or an increase to Ecu87.5bn by 1997. He compromised last month, suggesting a
rise to Ecu86.2bn over seven years (for a ceiling of 1.32 per cent of GNP in
1999). But Mr John Major, as current president of the EC Council, after
first refusing any change in the ceiling, had insisted on holding the line
at 1.25 per cent, which would have allowed spending of Ecu79.4bn in 1999 on
current EC growth and inflation projections.
Total 'structural' spending is to rise from Ecu18.6bn now to Ecu30bn in

Ecu27.4bn in 1999, and second, the new Cohesion Fund created by the

fund is solely for Spain, Ireland, Portugal and Greece, as their per capita
income is less than 90 per cent of the EC average, and is to help them meet
EC environmental standards and fill in the 'missing links' in pan-European
transport networks.
Spain gets its doubling of fiscal transfers not least because it has
informally endorsed claims on 55 per cent of the Cohesion Fund. The other
'cohesion' countries are not too unhappy because the main increase in the
Structural Funds applies to them.
Germany also gets a saleable deal. There is unlikely to be any net increase
in its huge Ecu9bn net contribution to the budget. Mr Horst Kohler, the
German state secretary for finance, pointed out that new eastern states
would get treatment equal to that of the cohesion countries, worth some
DM13bn (Pounds 5.3bn) over seven years - something of a rebate for Germany.

arms about the Uruguay Round farm trade deal. There is to be no formal
relaxing of farm spending limits, which will rise as foreseen from Ecu35.3bn
now to Ecu38.4bn in 1999.
But there is a 'weasel' paragraph allowing 'appropriate steps' to meet
exchange rate turbulence - which Commission officials already reckon could
plausibly produce an additional Ecu1.5bn for farmers.
It is 'internal policies' - on the environment, transport, R&amp;D and
infrastructure - which suffered most from the success of Spain and its
allies in prying loose the most from a tight Community wad.
These policies are the bread-and-butter of the EC's recent expansion of its

FT  14 DEC 92 / Major confident treaty has been salvaged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday voiced growing confidence that the successful outcome of
the Edinburgh summit had salvaged the Maastricht treaty.
But Mr John Major, the prime minister, insisted that British ratification of
the accord was contingent on a Yes vote in the second Danish referendum.
As he won praise from colleagues over his handling of the summit, he said
the crucial third reading of the Maastricht bill in the Commons would be
held after the Danish vote in late April or early May.
Senior aides said he was confident the Danish electorate would support the
accord agreed by its government in Edinburgh, thus rescuing the treaty.
But Mr Major, who successfully resisted pressure at the summit to set a
rigid timetable for ratification, signalled that if Denmark again voted No,
Britain would also abandon ratification.
British ministers said the agreements struck on Denmark's exemptions, on
enlargement and subsidiarity, would prove a turning point in efforts to
isolate Tory Euro-sceptics opposed to the treaty.
In a statement to MPs today, the prime minister is expected to characterise
the summit as a decisive turning point in Europe's fortunes - ending recent
paralysis and setting the stage for an outward-looking and decentralised
Community.
For their part, Tory Euro-sceptics said last night that they would step up
their efforts to wreck the legislation with lengthy Commons debate of the
hundreds of amendments already tabled.
The government also faced a warning from the opposition parties. The Liberal
Democrats, firm supporters of Maastricht, said their backing for the
government would depend on a 'speedy' third reading. Labour indicated that
it intended to keep Mr Major guessing on whether it would again oppose the
bill.
Mr Jack Cunningham, Labour's foreign affairs spokesman, described summit
proposals for European economic recovery as 'woefully inadequate', and said
a deal had only been struck at the expense of increased UK contributions to
the EC.
The direct link between Danish and British ratification - set out in detail
by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary - added a note of uncertainty to
what was widely judged to have been a considerable diplomatic success for
the prime minister.
Mr Hurd, speaking on BBC television, acknowledged that, if Denmark and
Britain rejected the treaty, some or all of the remaining 10 governments
might sign a new agreement. Britain would not leave Denmark isolated by
joining them, he said.
Mr Hurd acknowledged the risks by warning of the danger of Britain being
left outside any grouping which could take decisions affecting UK 'jobs,
prosperity and security'. Downing Street said the comments underlined its
commitment that the Community's 12 nations should move forward together.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Summit success paves way for EC enlargement: Edinburgh pact
on Community financing Danish opt-outs agreed

GOVERNMENTS in the European Community yesterday hailed the success of the
weekend summit at Edinburgh, saying it would provide a road map for the
Community's political development to the end of the century.
Mr John Major, UK prime minister who chaired the EC heads of government
meeting, declared that it would go down 'as the summit that put the
Community back together'.
Leaders of the 12 agreed on the crucial issues of future EC financing and
the Danish question, building a platform from which to relaunch the
Community in 1993 through immediate enlargement negotiations with Austria,
Sweden and Finland.
In spite of continuing turbulence in the currency market, EC officials said
they believed that the wide-ranging agreements in Edinburgh would restore
faith in the goal of a single currency by the end of the decade.
The Community faced an 'all or nothing' summit in which the much criticised
UK presidency had to pull off a series of interlocking deals on the EC
budget and Denmark's demands for legally-binding exemptions from the
Maastricht treaty. It also had to demonstrate to the citizens of Europe that
the EC could recover from the crisis triggered by Danish voters' rejection
of the treaty last June.
Thanks to the Edinburgh agreement, Denmark intends to resubmit the treaty to
its voters by May at the latest. The Copenhagen minority government is
confident of approval.
Copenhagen got everything it asked for at Edinburgh, declared Mr Poul
Schluter, its prime minister. In Denmark, the Edinburgh agreement was
welcomed by business leaders and greeted by newspaper headlines such as
'Triumph for Denmark' and 'Europe Gave Way'.
The country's leftwing Socialist People's party joined two other opposition
parties in declaring support for the deal. The party's executive committee
took the decision, after a five-hour meeting, to go along with the Social
Democrat and Radical Liberal parties, in backing the accord. This gives it
the backing of seven of the eight parties in the Folketing, the Danish
parliament.
Mr Major pledged to complete ratification of the treaty in the House of
Commons 'hard on the heels' of the Danish vote.
EC leaders agreed to make the Community more accountable through more
decentralised and open decision-making. They also presented a modest growth
package which calls for co-ordination of national macroeconomic policy and
increased spending at EC level on capital investment, roads,
telecommunications and infrastructure.
The two-day meeting was marked by tough bargaining. It was 'very hard going
and tense', according to prime minister Felipe Gonzalez of Spain who at one
stage during bilateral talks with Mr Major on Saturday threatened to walk
out.
Under the budget deal, EC leaders agreed to raise annual Community spending
from Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 52.7bn) in 1992 to Ecu84bn in 1999, in today's money.
The main winners are poorer EC members, led by Spain, which will receive
roughly double the amount of development aid. The finance agreement was
hailed by Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, who said he got
'85 per cent' of what he sought. But the policies developed by Brussels in
recent years will suffer as a result of the concessions to Spain, Portugal,
Greece and Ireland.
EC leaders expressed frustration over delays in ratifying the treaty.
Denmark and Britain were warned by EC leaders, including President Francois
Mitterrand, that they wanted ratification by summer. German foreign minister
Klaus Kinkel said: 'The fate of European union, which we have agreed upon in
Edinburgh, now lies in the hands of Britain and Denmark.'

FT  14 DEC 92 / Yeltsin wins deal to pursue economic reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government expects to press on with its economic and democratic
reforms following President Boris Yeltsin's compromise at the weekend with
the Congress of People's Deputies, the conservative-dominated parliament.
The deal with Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the conservative chairman of
parliament, extends Mr Yeltsin's special powers, enabling him to select his
prime minister from a Congress shortlist.
Hailed by supporters as a victory, it also fixes a date for a referendum on
constitutional change, paving the way for the first fully elected Russian
parliament.
Where the government was previously expected to survive at most until next
April, it is now Congress and the Supreme Soviet, its smaller permanent
body, which are under notice, since a new constitution would call for fresh
elections to a new parliamentary body. Father Gleb Yakunin, a prominent
liberal deputy, said 'the president now has a big advantage'.
The long-term survival of Mr Yegor Gaidar, acting prime minister and
guardian of economic reform, is still uncertain, but Mr Yeltsin could
confirm him in the post for a further three months if he is rejected in a
Congress vote, as he was narrowly last week.
Deputies will vote, probably today, on a slate of candidates to select a
shortlist of three from which Mr Yeltsin will choose a prime minister.
Many deputies, even Mr Gaidar's opponents, expect him to win at least a
temporary continuation of his post. But the government is also discussing
the idea that Mr Gaidar could move to head economic reform, something to
which he has been unable to give his full attention since becoming prime
minister.
Senior ministers and advisers said over the weekend that they believed the
deal, which fixed the date for a referendum on a new constitution on April
11, had raised the perspective for a new era in Russian politics - with a
modern democratic constitution underpinning an elected parliament with its
powers clearly defined.
One said: 'In effect, the Congress were persuaded to vote themselves out of
existence.' The Congress, with the Supreme Soviet, is a holdover from the
Soviet era - as is the much amended constitution.
However, there is concern the new government may have too little support to
push through a tougher line on credits and money supply to crack down on
rising inflation and a large budget deficit.
Mr Yeltsin emerged from his meeting with Mr Khasbulatov with:
A constitutional referendum, with the right to frame his own question if he
cannot agree it with Congress.
An extension of his special powers, allowing him to appoint a prime
minister, who must be confirmed by Congress, and issue decrees.
The commitment from the Congress not to change the power balance between it,
the president and the judiciary by changing the constitution, or the
referendum law, or elect judges to the two vacant seats on the
Constitutional Court.
The Congress won nothing on economic reform, with its gains confined to
personnel changes. It achieved:
The right to nominate and vote for alternative candidates for prime
minister.
The right, won earlier last week, to vote on the ministers of foreign
affairs, security, defence and interior. The sacking of Mr Gennady Burbulis,
closest aide to Mr Yeltsin, who has had several changes of title in the
past.

FT  14 DEC 92 / Customs change and beer wars begin to greet the single
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT STARTS as soon as you drive off the ferry. A youth in combat fatigues
standing only feet from French customs stuffs leaflets through the open car
windows.
Beer Wars, the leaflets say, advertising Eastenders, a 'beer and wine cash
and carry. Open 24 hours. All English staff'.
Calais is bracing itself for la vague anglaise, the invasion of Britons in
search of cheap alcohol expected from January, when the single European
market ends current limits on duty-free im-ports for personal use. Customs
has set 10 litres of spirits, 90 litres of wine, 110 litres of beer, 200
cigars and 800 cigarettes as 'indicative levels' for each adult.  Larger
amounts will be regarded as for commercial purposes unless it can be proved
they are for personal use - a family wedding, say.
Many Britons in Calais will avoid the town centre and head straight for
hypermarkets such as Mammouth, Continent and PG. Mammouth, a mecca for UK
visitors, is on the road to Boulogne, next to an ancient fort which was
probably designed to keep the British out. Mr Serge Loucheux, the manager,
hopes to increase sales of goods popular with the British by between 10 and
30 per cent next year.
The store's distribution centre has researched a list of the most popular
goods and will hold extra stocks. Mammouth has printed leaflets to
distribute at the ferry port, inviting visitors to 'make good bargains' on
what Mr Loucheux says most Brits come to buy: wines like Liebfraumilch and
Lambrusco, sherry, gin and beer - lots of it.
The aisles have been widened and Mr Loucheux expects an initial vague as
visitors take advantage of their new rights before numbers stabilise. 'It's
a bit symbolic. People enjoy the feeling that they have more liberty. It's a
psychological barrier that is coming down.'
While other supermarkets will also bombard the port with publicity, the
Calais chamber of commerce is advertising its shops in UK newspapers.
One trader it will not be promoting is Eastenders. In a bleak corner of a
Calais industrial estate, Eastenders looks more like a gypsy camp than a
cash and carry. Crates of beer and wine are covered by a tarpaulin at the
roadside, a brazier burns and an alsatian whines outside a dilapidated
caravan.
Cars draw up, crates of beer are loaded straight into the boot and wads of
notes change hands. Mr Dave West, the owner, says he will turn over Pounds
3m this year, buying goods direct from several European breweries. Mr West,
who gave up his job as a market trader in Essex four years ago, adds: 'They
don't like the Brits here. They want their money and they want them out of
here.'
He is in no doubt what January 1 will mean. 'It will be a mad free-for-all
for the first couple of months. Visitors could increase by 200 or 300 per
cent.'
He is determined to be there to meet them, in spite of the efforts of the
French authorities.
'I'll fight back just like my old man did at Dunkirk.'

KING HUSSEIN of Jordan was confirmed as being free from cancer over the
weekend, by doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.
A statement issued from the clinic by the king's personal physician said
post-operative tests had 'confirmed the complete success of surgery' last
August and doctors had found 'no abnormalities'. The king will have regular
check-ups.
Speculation that King Hussein was still suffering from cancer, despite the
surgery, had been rife in Jordan and the foreign press since a speech he
made to the nation on 5 November which many people interpreted as an
admission that cancer might take his life.
'One recognises that every living soul will meet its destined end,' he said.
'When the time comes no hour could be postponed or brought forward.'
The king left the hospital ahead of schedule and is due to spend a few days
in Washington, before returning to Jordan.

The 52 nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe agreed at
the weekend to establish a secretariat in Estonia to safeguard the minority
rights of Russians living in the former Soviet state, writes Robert Taylor
in Stockholm.
Observers are expected to be in place early in January.
The move supports a Swedish initiative taken a few months ago to try to
reduce ethnic tensions in Estonia. The CSCE mission would provide Russians
there with means to air grievances they might have about discrimination
against them by the Estonian authorities, the government said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COMMONWEALTH observers warned yesterday that Kenya's first multi-party
elections since 1966, scheduled for December 29, were in jeopardy unless
'irregularities' in last week's parliamentary nominations were resolved.
The warning follows Saturday's unprecedented walk-out by five western
ambassadors from a national day parade presided over by President Daniel
arap Moi. They said it had become a political rally on behalf of the
governing Kanu party.
Allegations that opposition parties had been prevented from nominating
candidates in as many as 45 parliamentary seats required urgent
investigation, said the Commonwealth observer group in a statement.
Its assessment of the poll is critical. If it decides the elections are not
'free and fair' most donors are likely to continue a freeze on aid imposed
in November 1991. Unless 'irregularities' in last week's nomination process
were rectified by a special committee of the electoral commission due to
meet today, this part of the election procedure would be considered
'severely compromised', the statement said.
Thirteen parliamentary candidates representing the Kenya African National
Union (Kanu), including Mr Moi, were unopposed when nominations for the 188
seat assembly closed on Thursday. Kanu is being challenged by three main
parties - Ford Kenya, Ford Asili, and the Democratic party - in a campaign
marked by ethnic rivalries and occasional violence.
The statement, approved in London by Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth
secretary-general, also expressed 'deep concern' about allegations of
'violence, misconduct and intimidation, apart from general impropriety on
the part of officials'. The elections 'may now be at risk', the statement
said.
Saturday saw five western ambassadors, including the US envoy, snub Mr Moi
when they walked out of the stadium holding a parade marking Kenya's 29th
anniversary of independence. Groups holding banners and placards extolling
the virtues of Mr Moi and Kanu were paraded before spectators. A US
spokesman said the occasion had been turned into 'a party rally'.
Envoys from the US, Germany, Sweden, Denmark and Canada left shortly before
President Moi addressed the rally. Sir Kieran Prendergast, the British high
commissioner, stayed in his seat.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Some day my prince will go: Even royal fairy tales can be
grim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LAST NIGHT, I met a reader of this column
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
he admitted it freely in public. 'I do hope,' he said, across the table,
'that this weekend you will avoid the royal family.' Well, I shall then do
my best to avoid them, but avoid writing about them I cannot. One can be
choosy about whom one meets, but the requirements of journalistic topicality
allow of no such social discrimination.
'End of the Fairy tale' declared the headline of almost every newspaper
after the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales was announced. This
was in no way logical since the same sort of newspapers had, initially,
declared it to be a 'fairy tale' marriage.
Leave aside the absurd, if unoriginal, hyperbole in all this. The point is:
what sort of fairy tales were most headline writers brought up on? All the
ones I ever had read to me involved all sorts of bizarre events. Princesses
were poisoned, locked up in towers, tormented by witches, and worse. The
Waleses' marriage clearly has become deeply unhappy but, compared with the
tales of the Brothers Grimm, it has been positively serene.
Perhaps the fairy tale was supposed to mean, simply, that a girl had married
her prince. This might be a commonplace among the masses; but among those
grand families whose virgin daughters are seen as ideal breeding material by
the Palace (and, in this, I do not include the family of Major Ronald
Ferguson), there exists no such sentimentality.
The late Earl Spencer, for example had few illusions. 'You could have done
better,' he is said to have told his daughter, Diana, when he learnt of her
engagement to the heir to the throne.
This was not just an astute awareness by the old boy that, in the era of
press intrusiveness, such a marriage could become more of a curse than a
blessing. Even in the halcyon days of the mid-1930s, when the press knew
their place and private lives were private, wise old Lord Halifax did his
diplomatic best to ensure that his only daughter, Anne, did not marry
George, Duke of Kent, a denouement that seemed very likely at one point.
The surprising aspect of this was that Lord and Lady Halifax were very close
friends of the Duke and Duchess of York, later to become King George VI and
Queen Elizabeth. But, as Andrew Roberts recounts in his biography of Edward,
Lord Halifax: 'He loved gossip and tittle-tattle and, although not a snob in
the conventional sense, delighted in the company of duchesses and reserved
for royalty a special exaltation.
'However, when it seemed likely that their only daughter might become
engaged to George, Duke of Kent, Lady Halifax recalled how 'Edward and I
were very apprehensive and did not at all like the prospect. It meant that
we should lose Anne in a way that we should not do in any other sort of
marriage. I felt sure also, knowing the royals well and their attitude to
ordinary life and ordinary people, that Edward and I would always feel very
much the poor relatives to the royal family.'
According to the Earl of Crawford, the duke went so far as to ask the king's
permission. When, in the fullness of time, the 'matrimonial project ended,'
it was much to the satisfaction of Halifax himself.
Lady Halifax's observation about being made to feel the poor relations was
prescient: that awareness seems to have caused at least some of the
disenchantment which led both the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of York
to regret their 'fairy tale' marriages. But add to that the horrific
stresses that press and other intrusiveness places on the brides of
Britain's royal family, and it becomes clear that the House of Windsor has a
problem which could affect its very continuity.
Having ruled out as brides virtually all suitable foreign royal princesses
(because of the archaic rule preventing marriage to a Catholic), the royal
males are in danger of being deemed unsuitable matches by all British
families of middling to good breeding and intelligence: they would not need
the wisdom and foresight of a Lord and Lady Halifax to see the potential for
their daughters' misery in marrying a potential heir to the throne.
If Britain's royal family is not to die out, two things must happen. The
press must be nicer to the House of Windsor, and the House of Windsor must
be nicer to its poor relations.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Truth of the Matter: The church and divorce - Philip Crowe
explains the Church of England's confusion about divorce and what that might
mean for a divorced monarch who is also head of the church
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP CROWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Whether a man marries or not, he will live to regret it.' - Socrates
SUCH CYNICISM is not confined to the fourth century BC. It extends also to
royal marriages in the 20th century.
It was not the tabloid press which exposed what the archbishop of the day
referred to, rather delicately, as 'The King's Matter,' in 1936.
The press, in the person of its proprietors, was committed to what now seems
an extraordinary anachronism, a gentleman's agreement to keep silent. But
when the storm broke, and the king abdicated, it was Archbishop Lang who
voiced the most severe criticisms. His God-speed was a notorious broadcast,
a dour blend of sympathy, snobbery and self-righteousness as the former king
'in the darkness left these shores'.
Lang dismissed the king's motives as 'a craving for private happiness,' and
then he said this: 'Even more strange and sad it is that he should have
sought his happiness in a manner inconsistent with the Christian principles
of marriage, and within a social circle whose standards and ways of life are
alien to all the best instincts and traditions of his people.' So much for
our American cousins.
Next day Stanley Baldwin, the prime minister, sent Lang a letter written in
his own hand, praising what he had said and ending: 'It was the voice of
Christian England.'
Many in 'Christian England' thought otherwise. The majority of letters were
so critical and so abusive that they were kept from the archbishop. There
were some in Christian England who thought that less cant and more charity
might have been in order.
Today's archbishops are more understanding of marital difficulties in the
royal household. They are different men, and the climate of opinion has
changed.
Dr John Hapgood, archbishop of York, manages to take comfort from thinking
that the separation, rather than something more dramatic, indicates a desire
to remain faithful to the marriage vows. But if two years of separation
leads, as it probably will, to divorce, and divorce leads to a wish to
remarry, the archbishops will be in a very different position.
At present, there is no bar at all, either constitutional or emotional, to
Prince Charles becoming head of the Church of England. But that Church still
maintains the strictest marriage discipline of any church in the world. Its
official position, debated with such anguish over the past 20 years, is that
'in order to maintain the principle of life-long obligation which is
inherent in every legally contracted marriage, and is set out in the
plainest terms in the marriage service, the Church should not allow the use
of that service in the case of anyone who has a former partner still
living.'
The resolutions which set out this position were passed in the aftermath of
the abdication crisis. Before 1938, divorce was rare and carried severe
social penalties. The law required that people who needed to escape from bad
marriages must either commit adultery or pretend, convincingly, that they
had done so.
Even Lang recognised that this was a bad law, although he could not bring
himself to vote for change because any change would, in his view, contradict
the mind of Christ. The Divorce Reform Act, introduced successfully by AP
Herbert in 1937, widened the grounds for divorce just a little, but enough
to worry the Church.
At the same time, the leading member of the royal family, then even more
than now the embodiment of ideals, overthrew those ideals for the sake of
private happiness and threatened to make divorce fashionable.
The C of E responded with neither grace nor understanding but with criticism
and rules, confident that such rules were true to the teaching of Jesus, The
Church did so for the best of motives, to maintain the sacredness of
marriage.
Some of the bishops, Henslay Hanson of Durham in particular, were realistic.
They knew that to lock people into bad marriages by means of strict divorce
laws only created a miserable society in which adultery and prostitution
flourished. Marriages fail, divorce must be possible, but those who fail
must maintain the ideal by living a life of celibacy after divorce. Jesus
had said so. Did he not teach that 'anyone who divorces his wife, and
marries another, commits adultery against his wife?'
We think that divorce in our society, on almost any grounds, after just one
year of marriage, is lax. But at the time of Jesus, Jewish law allowed men
to divorce women (although not the other way round) on trivial grounds, such
as burning the toast; recommended divorce for more serious matters, like
talking with a man in the street; required divorce for sexual offences, like
flirting; but after any act of illicit sex, the law demanded that the woman
be stoned. She had made herself unclean and no one must touch her, neither
her husband nor her executioners.
In this context, Jesus is utterly outrageous. You men have made these
divorce laws for your own convenience, he says, because you are so
hard-hearted, so unforgiving. Your laws allow you to throw women out on the
streets, even to kill them, to preserve your own manhood, even when you
yourselves are unfaithful. But the God-given ideal is that if you marry, it
is for life. Even if your wife is unfaithful, you should forgive.
Small wonder that the disciples of Jesus found this so deeply shocking.
Better not to marry, they said, than to forgive adultery and take an unclean
woman back into the marital bed.
To take this teaching out of its context in Pharisaic Judaism, and make it
the basis for regulations about divorce and remarriage in the 20th century,
misses the point. It turns Jesus into another Pharisee. Gradually, the
Church is coming to recognise that marriage is a personal relationship
requiring forgiveness as well as faithfulness, and that the ideals of
marriage cannot be preserved by means of negative regulations about
remarriage.
Those resolutions, which captured the mind of the Church as it was in 1932,
were confirmed in 1957. But in 1985, the general synod of the Church of
England, after long and anguished debate, was asked to confirm the
resolutions again. The synod declined to do so. So it was asked to rescind
the resolutions. It declined to do that as well.
It was not a particularly elegant piece of fence-sitting; rather, it was a
grim, and probably last, attempt to maintain the ideals of marriage by means
of ecclesiastical rules. Holding to the ideal will be marginally more
difficult now that the family which is supposed to embody those ideals has
found them so difficult to sustain.
But the reality of knotted and broken relationships which form such a large
part of the human condition, will press upon the Church more strongly, the
more so because of the understanding of the two archbishops.
Those who experience the pain of divorce, and wish to remarry in church,
often do so, as I know from experience, from mixed motives. But, almost
invariably, there is some reaching out for an ideal, dimly understood, so
far elusive, but possibly something to do with God.
To meet such longings with ecclesiastical rules is to deny the grace, the
fidelity and the forgiveness which may, after all, be the essentials of what
Jesus taught about marriage.

<TEXT>
ON THURSDAY morning I skidded into Gatwick on an overnight flight from
Barbados. I had started in St Lucia - boat from Jalousie Plantation to
Castries, then a hopper-flight to Bridgetown. By the time I reached Gatwick
I was tired and dehydrated. But I was not cast down. Rather the opposite: I
was gripped by cheerfulness, suffused by a pearly light.
I do not eat on aircraft. Neither can I sleep. What I do is read, so I
arranged my books around me. At present I am reading four books. All
refreshingly middle-brow. Nothing stuck up about me. Yet I could not settle
to any of them. Was I having a panic attack? Should someone tell the pilot?
I reached for the sick-bag but in my confusion plucked up highlife, the
in-flight magazine of the world's favourite airline. At once my pulse began
to settle; my cells were drenched with lifeforce; I started to hum a hymn; I
blessed the people around me.
Have you seen highlife recently? In a time of sorrow and recession, of
calamity and hideous schism, highlife shines a beacon to all the world's
lost peoples. Do not think of it as a free-sheet devoted to peddling
holidays. Think of it as evangelical, its message as bright as moonshine:
We're enjoying a golden age, folks. We really, really are.
Everything is upbeat in highlife. No place is a dump, for every place is
beautiful. Poverty is almost unknown. Pollution is a fiction. Trade wars are
a lie. No clouds dim the sky. Rivers run fast and pure. The planet is an
Eden. No-one kills a dolphin. If we just reach out a hand, humming-birds
alight on it and whistle a happy tune.
To accomplish its sacred mission of spreading optimism and cheer, highlife
does not dip in and out of the bran-tub of travel-writing cliches
fastidiously or selectively: it welds them together half-a-mile at a time.
In highlife, India is 'a land of infinite variety and complexity' with a
'rich architectural heritage, picturesque street life and extraordinary
mosaic of cultures.' Goa has a 'curiously seductive identity.' Penang, in
Malaysia, is a 'holiday playground' of 'swaying palm trees, great beaches,
large swimming pools . . . lovely sunsets.' In Thailand, Phuket has
'magnificent beaches of soft golden sand, splendid scenery and rich coral
and marine life.' Along the 'sun-blessed vacation coasts' of Kenya and
Tanzania, the great cities of a now forgotten civilisation once flourished
'like a necklace of pearls strung out along the azure-fringed coast of East
Africa.'
Then there is the section of the magazine devoted to duty-free goods brought
to us by discerning manufacturers whose elves and fairies have toiled all
year to make this Christmas a memorable one. On Thursday I could have bought
gallons of posh fragrance. Or a Raymond Weil Parsifal watch for Pounds 575.
Or 57gm of 'skin caviar' for just Pounds 68.
There is a woman I know who describes anything she does not like, anything
that offends her eye, as 'pukey pukey.' Anything she does like  - a plate of
peasant soup, a Tuscan hill at sundown, a dark-curled youth astride a red
motor-scooter - is 'blissy blissy.' As my flight from Barbados shuddered
towards sunrise and I read deeper into highlife, all I could mutter was
'blissy blissy,' like a toad in a honey vat, drowning but happy, confident
of an after-life.
The man who edits and publishes highlife is the redoubtable and
inexhaustible William Davis, who is also chairman of the British Tourist
Authority. What a cross he has to bear, what vicissitudes must test him, as
he wages his campaign against pessimism, depression, fear, sadness,
pre-millennial tension and malicious mis-representation of the joyful facts
of life.
Davis writes often to the newspapers. Nothing passes him by. Should a
journalist misrepresent him, or fail to take him seriously, then swift is
his retribution, his letters of rebuttal as unerring in their delivery as
the spears of our ancestors into the eye of a shaggy mammoth.
Bill Davis is worth the government and the opposition put together. No
honour should be denied him. His salary should be tripled. He should live in
a palace with a garden full of primroses. He is a giant of a man. Our hero.
Our saviour.
This afternoon I am catching Lithuanian Airlines' flight TE453 from Heathrow
to Vilnius. Now that should be interesting.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Private View: Patriotism by another name - Sir Ronald
Grierson is a European and a sceptic, but not a Eurosceptic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE-QUARTERS of the British people, we hear, want a referendum on the
Maastricht treaty. Yet, according to another opinion poll before the
Edinburgh summit which ends today, an astonishing 48 per cent of them don't
know which way they would vote.
The public senses that the EC summiteers are struggling up to a political
watershed, yet is baffled. It seemed a good week, therefore, in which to
buttonhole that urbane and cosmopolitan banker and captain of industry, Sir
Ronald Grierson, before he took off for a little pheasant shooting in
Scotland.
For Grierson, as well as being a member of the intellectual jet-set - he is
a former chairman of London's South Bank arts complex - was once himself a
top Eurocrat, running the industry directorate in Brussels. He is thoroughly
British: a lieutenant-colonel in the Black Watch, an SAS paratrooper, a
well-connected Conservative of the old school - and he is German.
He was born Griessmann in Nuremberg, Bavaria, (a fact he is not ashamed to
record in Who's Who) where his Jewish grandfather owned a large paper mill.
He went to the local gymnasium, to a lycee in Paris, to London and to
Oxford. Over dinner at the Berkeley Hotel in 1943, with the help of an
attractive girl and a telephone directory, he changed his name. He became a
British citizen in 1946.
He had been imprisoned by both sides during the war. Interned by the British
at the start, he fell into German hands at the end after being badly wounded
behind the lines. (He was rescued by his SAS commander.) He has lived in
Italy, France, Switzerland and the US, as well as London. The day I
interviewed him, he had just flown back from hearing Pavarotti at La Scala.
If anyone could tell me what a good European should do, it was he.
But first I asked him why he had kept his German passport.
'Some people think it's an affectation. It isn't. I just happen to believe
that while you can change your passport, you can't change your nationality.
I am German. I can't do anything about it. That doesn't alter the fact that
all my grown-up life I have had only one loyalty, to Britain.'
What does it mean to say you are German?
'I'm German in the ethnic sense,' he replied. 'It's not a thing I have
always been very proud of. There have have been moments when it has
embarrassed me, although at the moment it doesn't. Whatever the Germans are
blamed for, I feel I must take some of that blame, even if it is very
little.' He laughed.
Did the reunification of Germany mean anything to you? 'I was not
emotionally involved at all.'
Are you embarrassed when you read about the rampaging of the neo-Nazis?
'One never likes one's fellow citizens to behave like louts. I feel exactly
the same way when such things happen in this country. Germany is not the
only country where it has happened, but one judges a revival of Nazi salutes
and swastikas there much more harshly than one would in a country which had
not had the same history. I think the jury is out. Everything depends on how
the German government handles it - and I am impressed on the whole by how
their governments have behaved since the war.'
What do you say to the view that a powerful Germany can never be trusted
again?
'I think the jury is out on that as well. I believe the German government
has behaved extremely well so far - impeccably. As to what the future holds,
who knows? But the EC is not necessarily the big bulwark in case of
trouble.'
Is there such a thing as national character?
Sir Ronald would not be drawn. 'It is a term I have always been chary of
using because it is an oversimplification. Very often, when one talks of
national characteristics, one is really thinking of caricatures.
'But there are certain things which are quite peculiarly British, such as
the anxiety which I think is bred into people at their public schools never
to cause embarrassment. It is a very nice characteristic, but of course it
can sometimes make you avoid important decisions.'
He has described the establishment, by which he means the civil service
mandarins, as an 'intimidating mafia'. Yet it is difficult to see him as the
outsider he describes in his recent short book of memoirs, A Truant
Disposition. Tall, elegant, courteous - he addresses you as 'Mr' - Grierson
has a mandarin fondness for the qualifying phrase which clarifies his views
but hides his feelings.
His business career, beginning with SG Warburg and ending with GEC, included
spectacular resignations from Harold Wilson's Industrial Reorganisation
Corporation and from Brussels (he never believed in 'picking winners'). It
was peppered with disputes with Whitehall because he refused 'to work the
system'.
Does being German give you an excuse for not conforming to standard upper
middle-class norms?
'I have never thought of that and I have certainly never used it as an
excuse.'
Grierson describes himself as cynical and not easily provoked. I had heard
otherwise.
Do you simulate anger to secure objectives? Grierson was delighted. 'The
answer, I'm afraid, is yes, unashamedly. It is what General de Gaulle used
to describe as 'la susceptibilite payante'.
The secret of Grierson's insouciance seems to be his inheritance from the
sale of the family paper mill - and the complicity of his wife, Heather,
formerly Viscountess Bearsted. They have allowed him to switch back and
forth between careers with the result - though he says it causes him no
regret - that he never reached the top job once forecast for him.
I asked him what kind of Europe he would settle for. 'I would settle for a
Europe of fatherlands, the Europe des patries of General de Gaulle,' he
said.
There were only two objectives for the EC: economic prosperity and peace.
The common market was an attempt to create the prosperity, but peace would
depend on the Franco-German alliance, which he considered the principal
achievement of the Community, and the Nato umbrella.
But isn't economic interdependence itself supposed to be a guarantee of
peace?
'Its importance can be over-rated. There are still big differences of
approach which are usually papered over by some rather expensive and fairly
sordid compromises - and that, no doubt, is what's going to happen at
Edinburgh this weekend.'
The Europeans were not ready for political union, he said. 'My friends who
disagree say Europe is in a mess. But if you are in a mess, you don't
necessarily jettison the existing political system and opt for one that has
not been tried. I think co-operation between politically sovereign countries
still works very effectively. I do not see why we have to have new
institutions to adopt a common foreign policy. What is wrong with Europe
remaining a group of nation states, co-ordinating their foreign and defence
policy in the same way as is done at the UN and in Nato?'
Is your objection to political union pragmatic, or are you afraid it will
destroy something you value?
'No, it is largely practical. If I woke up tomorrow and found an extremely
effective European government had come into power by some miracle, I do not
think I would be emotionally disturbed. But I do not see how we are going to
get there in the foreseeable future.'
It should be said that Grierson is a committed 'Atlanticist'. The
anti-Americanism he found in Brussels was one reason for his quitting the
Commission. He has served on a number of US boards and was briefly a
gentleman peanut farmer in Georgia, not far from Jimmy Carter's estate.
'You see, the thing that is missing in all this is European patriotism; and
I do not see us finding one to co-exist with our national patriotisms. It
will certainly not happen as a result of organising a European arts festival
to celebrate the British presidency in Edinburgh] It is from history, from
looking back at battles fought and won - or fought and lost - that people
have obtained this feeling.'
You say that, I objected, but you carry two banners yourself.
'I told you at the beginning. My entire loyalty is to Britain. I happen to
be a German who is loyal to Britain. I admire the German government but I
have no loyalty to it. I want to make that clear.'
If there were a referendum on Maastricht, how would you vote?
The question seemed to catch him unawares; it looked as if I had found a
high-ranking Don't Know.
Grierson mused a while, and said: 'Well, I would want to help the
government. Then there are people in the anti-camp with whom I would not
want to be photographed, so to speak - though, of course, it is always an
honour to be photographed with Margaret Thatcher,' he added hastily.
'So I would probably, with great reluctance, with my fists clenched as it
were, vote Yes.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: Yeats with the paintbrush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'AN AGED man is but a paltry thing . . .' wrote WB Yeats. That surely was
not true of his brother Jack the painter who died at the ripe old age of 85
in 1957, active as an artist to the end. 'His last drawing,' his biographer
Hilary Pyle tells us was done 48 hours before his death, 'a tiny gay
swirling sketch of two roundabout ponies'.
Jack Yeats was in his sixties when he painted some of the great works on
which his reputation rests and which may now be located through use of the
three volumes of the definitive catalogue of his work in oil. It has been
compiled in the wake of her biography of the artist (1970, revised edition
1989) by Hilary Pyle.
Yeats was acclaimed in 1945 by the Irish art critic Thomas MacGreevy as
Ireland's greatest painter - 'the national painter', he affirmed 'in the
sense that Rembrandt and Velasquez and Watteau were national painters'.
While not wholly disagreeing, Samuel Beckett - also a passionate admirer -
jibbed at the attempt to confine Yeats's genius within nationalistic
boundaries.
'He is', wrote Beckett, 'with the great of our time, Kandinsky and Klee,
Ballmer and Bram van Velde, Rouault and Braque, because he brings light, to
the issueless predicament of existence, reduces the dark where there might
have been, mathematically at least, a door'.
Is such rhetoric more relevant to Beckett's plays than to Yeats's painting?
Extravagantly phrased as the encomium is, some of the colour plates of the
late oil paintings reproduced here go far to justify it. Yeats began as an
illustrator, working as a young man for Punch and other journals, turning to
water-colours and drawings, and then into a bold fluent exponent of the
medium of oil.
His late manner is as different from the work of his youthful period as is
Dubliners from Finnegans Wake. He moved in 1917 to Ireland from England
where he was born and lived there for the rest of his time. He loved the
landscape and the country people in whose life he found an inexhaustible
vein of inspiration. His work was rich in studies of the Irish landscape
with its rivers, sea, cliffs and beaches.
In his old age these natural forms with the human and animal figures that
inhabit them are transformed by a luminous palette richly applied to give us
a transcendental vision. Yeats's closest kinship - in his maturity - is with
the chromatic canvases of Turner and the apocalyptic fugues of Kokoshka.
His painting 'Tinkers' Encampment; The Blood of Abel' (1940) has a crimson
patch of blood in the foreground lit up by a small girl in blue with a
torch. Figures of men and donkeys are converging on it from the crowded camp
sited on a mountainous strip on the far side of a river. Painted during the
Second World War, it was the closest Yeats ever came to a direct political
statement.
More typical of the late manner is 'Come' in which a farmer stretches out
his arms beckoning a horse towards him. Man and beast are shown linked in a
strange, wild amity.
Yeats bore witness in his paintings and his eccentric fictional writings to
the survival of that romantic Ireland which his brother lamented was dead
and gone. He produced a fine set of illustrations for Synge's The Aran
Islands. But the most frequent subjects in the vast body of work now
catalogued are horses. There are times when Yeats makes Munnings seem like
an amateur.
When the Irish Free State evolved WB Yeats became a senator, 'a smiling
public man', Jack remained a republican; but although the brothers diverged
in their affiliations, their admiration and support for each other's art
never wavered.
Pyle has been both thorough and scholarly. It was the greatest stroke of
luck that the dealer Waddington had a gallery in Dublin and discovered Yeats
comparatively early. Yeats had his first exhibition with Waddington in 1943,
and stayed with him for the rest of his career. This catalogue, for which
the Waddington Gallery has provided much of the information, is inscribed in
Victor Waddington's memory.

WALT WHITMAN: From Noon to Starry Night
by Philip Callow
Allison and Busby Pounds 19.99, 394 pages
WHITMAN is a curious figure in literary history. He stands on the
indeterminate border between greatness and absurdity, his work a mixture of
extraordinary genius and mere bombast.
Philip Callow has performed a service in helping us to understand Whitman.
The inexorably rolling periods of Whitman's chief poetic work, Leaves of
Grass, make better sense when we learn that it is modelled on opera; it is,
Callow suggests, a collection of arias and recitatives, made for utterance
in the grand theatrical manner because its subject is itself grand and
theatrical: human destiny; the energy of America, America's prairies, vast
skies and burgeoning cities.
Whitman himself becomes explicable when we see him selfconsciously rising to
a challenge facing the US in its boisterous 19th-century adolescence: the
need for a national poet. Many had called for this; Alexis de Tocqueville,
when visiting America, noted the absence of a major poet; Ralph Waldo
Emerson yearned for one; the press called for a 'Homer of the mass' to
arise. At the age of 36, after years of miscellaneous drifting, Whitman
discovered himself to be that Homer.
Whitman was born on long Island in 1819, one among the large family of a
bibulous carpenter and his Dutch wife. He left school early and was
apprenticed to a printer, graduating to journalism after spells as a teacher
in various rural schools. Because of the proliferation of newspapers in New
York, and the hectic warfare of political factions, Whitman found plenty of
journalistic work. His first editorial appointment came in his early
twenties. The New York tuppenny sheets were not unlike our own odiferous
tabloids, but Whitman relished his task, particularly the preaching and
opining which the customary high-moralising style of Victorian editorials
demanded.
In his poetry Whitman appears as a frontiersman, a fearless traverser of
prairies, rejoicing in health and independence. In fact he made few journeys
beyond the environs of New York: the longest being to New Orleans where he
worked for several months. Despite wishing to take a romantic view of
America's splendours, he found the Mississippi merely muddy: and the
bone-rattling rigours of stagecoach travel disagreeable. But all he needed
was a hint. In his poems the vastness of America unfolds cinematically, and
Whitman hymns the promise and beauty of mountains, lakes, rivers, cities and
people as if he knew everything about each one of them personally.
It is a mystery how Leaves of Grass sprang from Whitman in 1855: given the
undistinguished character of his preceding writings. He published it at his
own expense, and promoted it by anonymously contributing glowing reviews to
newspapers. He need not have done so; Emerson was ravished by the book and
other eminent critics agreed. Praise was not, however, unanimous, and many
readers found it obscene. But once it was launched, Whitman's name was made.
The book went through many editions, with Whitman adding to it and changing
it constantly.
The largest single addition is the sequence of poems called Drum Taps,
recording Whitman's Civil War experiences as a visitor to victims of battle
in Washington's hospitals. Despite the deep emotion of these poems, they are
not in the same class as the centrepiece of Leaves of Grass, the
extraordinary Song of Myself. Whitman saw himself as the spokesman of that
new human phenomenon, the American individual, a robust and democratic free
spirit striding into a confident future. The 'I' of the poems is this
overflowing character, embracing as a birthright everything good in life:
sex, joy, independence, the wild woods and the comradeship of man.
There is much beauty in Whitman's poetry, but it can also be pompous and
bathetic. Whitman spent his last years paralysed by strokes, living modestly
in a grimy New Jersey suburb. His reputation grew steadily, and among those
who read and admired him were Swinburne, Yeats and DH Lawrence - even,
Callow tells us, Vincent van Gogh in Arles. With his flowing white hair and
beard he looked to one visitor like 'a great old Angora Tom'. To the last he
kept his secrets: was he homosexual? What were his real views of slavery?
Callow, if he knows, keeps us guessing; but at the same time gives us a
compelling portrait of the poet and his place and time.

VICTORIAN TALES OF MYSTERY AND DETECTION
edited by Michael Cox
Oxford Pounds 17.95, 578 pages
OVER THE past several years Oxford University Press have brought out a
series of anthologies devoted to the literature of crime, mystery and
detection, specialising in the Victorian period. In collaboration with RA
Gilbert, Michael Cox edited two of these volumes The Oxford Book of English
Ghost Stories and Victorian Ghost Stories: An Oxford Anthology. Now, on his
own, he has produced a fat collection of some 31 tales, with a knowledgeable
and useful introduction, under the title Victorian Tales of Mystery and
Detection.
The addicted reader of mysteries will find some expectable, now quaint,
period elements: heathen idols, swarthy Mediterraneans, secret sects, not to
mention exotic and seductive women, blunt Americans, thieving clerks (and
gentlemen crooks as well). He will also find some familiar stories,
favourite classic authors like Poe ('The Purloined Letter'), Le Fanu ('The
Murdered Cousin'), Dickens ('Hunted Down'), Wilkie Collins ('Who Killed
Zebedee?'), plus - inevitably - two contributions of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle,
one with Holmes ('Adventure of the Blue Carbuncle') and one without ('The
Lost Special').
In the 19th century when popular periodicals were numerous, the short story
reigned supreme, and Sir Arthur was only the most enduring of dozens of
practitioners. Various Victorian detectives, revived in this book, herald
later celebrities: there are several ancestors of the elegant, flippant Sir
Peter Wimsey as there is more than one armchair detective, who solves his
cases without leaving his study, using only ratiocination (or 'little grey
cells,' as a famous Belgian used to say).
What is most fascinating about the these stories is the indirect picture of
Victorian life they give. Trains figure prominently, as does the postal
system (both operating with an often-remarked efficiency that today's
metropolitans can only envy). Commuting was in its early stages, and the
flight from the city had just begun.
We not only learn about the geography of suburbia but also about its
xenophobia. Cox singles out 'Alessandro Pozzone', which was published first
in a monthly called Belgravia in 1878, as 'the beginnings of a new era', the
heyday of the 'objective record of evidence and circumstance within a
circumscribed location, and with a single ingenious idea at its heart'. But
the new era was certainly as wide-ranging in its choice of subject and style
as the earlier period had been, and this mammoth Oxford volume illustrates
the richness of that lamented literary harvest.

JUST THE ONE
by Graham Lord
Sinclair-Stevenson, Pounds 16.00, 340 pages
JEFFREY Bernard has made a living out of failure: not a good living but an
interesting one. He failed at school, failed with his mother, failed with
four wives and a reputed 500 mistresses, failed as a novelist, failed to
give up drinking, frequently failed as a journalist. He even failed to
commit suicide successfully on numerous occasions.
Finally his failure made him a modest fortune when old pal Keith Waterhouse
transmogrified the 'Low Life' column in The Spectator, Bernard's weekly
diatribe on his purgatory, into a stage play. With Peter O'Toole playing the
anti-hero, Jeffrey Bernard is Unwell was a surprise hit, providing enough
money for Bernard to pay off his income tax.
Now comes his biography, stoically written by Graham Lord. (Bernard failed
to deliver an autobiography despite accepting advances from three publishers
and running an ad. asking for information as to what he was doing between
1960 and 1974). Rarely can a biographer have painted such an honestly
unbecoming portrait of his subject.
For years Bernard got away with stealing from friends, seducing their wives,
selling his body, throwing up over the Queen Mother and much more because he
was handsome and witty, with upper middle class charm. But, as Francis Bacon
put it, 'What are you going to do now, Jeffrey, now that your looks are
gone?'
The answer was obvious. Bernard, now 60, has spent the past 20 years
re-telling the horror stories of the first 40 years of his life. Lord has
padded these out by talking to his ex-wives (generally hostile) and
girlfriends, and his old boozing partners. Bernard has heroically
co-operated, although his memory is blurred for the many years when he was
almost totally drunk.
Lord's own horror stories are breathtaking: Bernard ignoring his mentally
disturbed sister when she became a Soho bag lady; Bernard coming to terms
with the fact that his third wife had a daughter even though he was sterile;
Bernard going drinking on his honeymoon night (probably a recurring
phenomenon).
In his 'End Piece' Lord tries to make the best of Bernard, on the lines that
'he brightened our lives'. But this hardly excuses the overwhelming
selfishness which has enabled him to trample on so many people. As the book
says, Jeffrey Bernard rarely laughs; but he might smile at his contribution
to a biography which is appalling but never boring.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: Politician without a permanent address - Robert Blake
discusses a neglected aspect of Churchill's career

CHURCHILL ON THE HOME FRONT: 1900-1955
by Paul Addison
Jonathan Cape Pounds 20.00, 493 pages
IN 1975 Paul Addison published a brilliant and original study of British
domestic policy in the Second World War The Road to 1945. Now he has written
a most illuminating book on a neglected aspect of the career of the most
remarkable statesman of the 20th century.
I do not know whether or not Paul Addison originally intended to write a
comprehensive biography of Churchill but, he has in the event concentrated
on his role in social and economic affairs rather than in war and foreign
policy. This is a sensible decision and fills a significant gap. There have
been studies of aspects of Churchill's domestic role, notably in Anthony
Seldon's Churchill's Indian Summer, an account of his last government. But
no one hitherto has told the whole story.
Churchill's political career which lasted 55 years brought him as much in
contact with home affairs as military and imperial. President of the Board
of Trade, Home Secretary, Minister of Munitions, largely concerned with
industrial and labour problems, and finally Chancellor of the Exchequer 1924
to 1929. And, although his great premiership was mainly concerned with war,
no prime minister can entirely ignore what is happening inside his country.
Churchill's attitude to social and economic problems was a curious mixture
of the radical and the reactionary. As President of the Board of Trade
1908-10 he, along with Lloyd George, can claim much of the credit for
inaugurating what came to be known after the second world war as the
'welfare state'. Liberalism he declared in October 1906 was 'the cause of
the left-out millions'.
Churchill's genuine radicalism was designed to make the capitalist system
more humane and more acceptable. He never thought for a moment in terms of
replacing it by something quite different. All his life, one full of
inconsistencies, he had a consistent antipathy - socialism. He described it
in a speech in October 1906 as 'a monstrous and imbecile conception which
can find no real foothold in the brains and hearts of sensible people'.
Most Conservatives would agree, and dislike of socialism does not in itself
brand him as reactionary. But there were attitudes which do. His intense
aversion to Indian self-government in the 1930s was one and he certainly did
his best to block Beveridge and the Coalition plans for post-war
reconstruction in 1943-45.
For most of his political life Churchill was simply not trusted. This was
partly because of his somewhat dubious 'court', Birkenhead, Beaverbrook,
Boothby, Bracken etc, but it was also because - particularly in home affairs
 -he refused to think in party terms. He changed parties twice and seldom
stayed long on the same stance within the party to which he had moved.
Churchill, as Addison puts it, 'was a politician without a permanent
address'. Not the least valuable service performed by this fascinating book
is to show how and why the greatest political figure of his time found
himself in this ambivalent position until the events of 1940 transformed the
whole situation and made him a national hero.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Books: Coffee table travel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION or not, coffee table travel books are still thudding from the
presses, many of them distinguished by standards of photography and
reproduction that seem realer than reality.
A good example: The Nature of Russia by John Massey Stewart, published by
Boxtree (Pounds 17.99) and based on Anglia Television's Survival series. The
TV films were first-rate and so is the book, which includes more than 100
specially commissioned pictures, some from previously inaccessible areas.
One day, wildlife tourism may be as important to the former Soviet Union as
it now is to Africa. This book tells why.
The same could be said of Indonesia, and of Wild Indonesia by Tony and Jane
Whitten, with photographs by Gerald Cubitt (New Holland Publishers, Pounds
24.99). Indonesia is made up of more than 13,000 islands: an archipelago of
immense beauty and biological importance whose protection has become one of
the biggest ecological issues of our time. This Is Zimbabwe, by Peter Joyce
(New Holland, Pounds 19.99), was also photographed by Gerald Cubitt. It is
not quite as ambitious as the Indonesian book, but Cubitt's work is - again
 -a wonder.
From the sublime to - well, Timpson's English Villages, by John Timpson,
with pictures by Michael Stead (Headline Book Publishing, Pounds 19.99).
Timpson says he has avoided a surfeit of maypoles and morris dances;
instead, he chose his villages to reflect the quirkier aspects of English
social history, and in that he has succeeded.
More specialised is Portrait of the Tweed, a celebration of the Borders
landscape by Ian Bavington Jones, who also took the pictures (Cassell,
Pounds 20). The author takes a year in the life of the river, tracing it
upstream, season by season, to its source in the remote moorland of upper
Tweedsdale. Plenty of legends and anecdotes. Just as attractive is Highland
Sketchbook - A Year in Glen Esk, by Derek Robertson (HarperCollins, Pounds
17.99), which mixes diary and artwork from a year-long journey through Glen
Esk, in the foothills of Scotland's Grampian mountains. And there are those
who will enjoy Queen Victoria's Scotland by Michael Stead, who also took the
photographs (Cassell, Pounds 17.99), which draws on the queen's journals as
well as historical accounts to trace her progress through the Highlands.
Some of the best photography on offer is Tom Kelly's, in Ireland: The Living
Landscape (Roberts Rinehart, Pounds 17.95), which has text by Peter
Somerville-Large and poems by Seamus Heaney. Kelly, says the publisher, is
considered Ireland's greatest landscape photographer. Some of the work here
is good enough to make your heart stop.
Egypt is a crowded market in the coffee table stakes, but Egypt, by Peter
Stocks, with photographs by David Couling (George Philip, Pounds 19.99),
merits attention. Far more unusual is A Historical Atlas of the Jewish
People, edited by Eli Barnavi (Hutchinson, Pounds 30). It is beautifully
produced and spans more than three millennia. There are nearly 1,000 maps,
plus drawings, photographs, chronologies and commentaries by dozens of
experts. The atlas covers all main themes of the Jewish experience:
prehistory, biblical background, tribal movements, revolts, wars, religious
developments and the growth and shaping of the Jewish faith. Where it can,
it touches on language, literature, art and music. First rate.
Also beautifully produced is Christopher Saxton's 16th Century Maps (Swan
Hill Press, Pounds 14.95). In the 1570s, under the authority of Elizabeth I,
Saxton, a Yorkshireman from Wakefield, surveyed and drew maps of all the
counties of England and Wales. This is a facsimile edition of the
hand-coloured copies of Saxton's maps from the library at Chatsworth House,
with an introduction by Prof William Ravenhill of Exeter University.
For those who like their travel in bitefuls, Michael Palin's Pole to Pole
(BBC Books, Pounds 16.95) is easily recommended. Nice idea: pole-to-pole
along the line of longitude 30`E (Leningrad, Istanbul, Luxor, etc). And more
first-rate photography: Basil Pao.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts: Musical stars shine out in the Northern sky - The
'Tender is the North festival'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TITLE still seems just as silly as it ever did but 'Tender is the
North', the Barbican-based celebration of Scandinavian arts, has proved
itself one of the most worthwhile and comprehensive of such festivals in
London. It all ends tomorrow, when Colin Davis conducts the last concert in
his immensely authoritative Sibelius cycle.
For its final week, however, the focus of activity switched very definitely
to the Scandinavia of today; five concerts of contemporary music selected by
the Finnish composer Kaija Saariaho have been given in The Place theatre;
the last of them will take place this evening.
A decade ago such a survey of new Scandinavian music would have attracted
little attention. But the 1980s saw the emergence from northern Europe of a
whole cadre of composers in their thirties and forties, all very different
in style and approach, who rapidly made distinctive marks. Two of the Finns,
Saariaho herself, born in 1952, and Magnus Lindberg (born in 1958), must now
be ranked alongside the most important figures of their generation.
This northern renaissance has not been at all fortuitous; it had a whole
complex of cultural and historical catalysts, though perhaps the most
significant of them was the opportunity for young composers from Scandinavia
to study abroad and especially to work at IRCAM in Paris. As a result they
have mastered a wonderful diversity of musical language, totally without its
compositional dogma.
It was revealing to see the 20th-century masterworks that Saariaho had
included as benchmarks in her programmes; there were pieces by Ligeti,
Messiaen, Berg and Takemitsu, all of them free spirits technically speaking,
intensely intuitive yet at the same time highly disciplined.
Tuesday's opening concert, given by the excellent Finnish ensemble Avanti],
conducted by Jutta-Pekka Saraste, was the most prestigious of the series:
Ligeti's Chamber Concerto preceded a new work by Saariaho and Lindberg's
impressively argued and harmonically lucid Joy, which the London Sinfonietta
introduced to London last year. Saariaho's piece, Amers, was a joint
commission from IRCAM and the Barbican; it is a cello concerto in all but
name, a single 20-minute span. The soloist (Anssi Karttunen here) is
amplified: courtesy of IRCAM technology each string of the instrument has
its own microphone and the sounds can be diffused independently around the
hall. The ensemble contains a pair of synthesisers (generally sampling
metallic timbres); there is also a computer-generated tape.
The aural benefits of such a highly intricate set-up were not entirely clear
at this first performance; a larger space might have given the cello lines
more mobility and focus. As it was Amers could be admired for the fastidious
selection of its material, the delicately graded and controlled textures,
the unexpected harmonic shifts and rhythmic collisions. Each of Saariaho's
wonderfully assured works leaves one wanting to hear much more, especially
the big orchestral pieces which remain unperformed in Britain.
In Avanti]'s second concert on Thursday the modern classic was Berg's
Chamber Concerto with Ernst Kovacic and Tuija Hakkila as soloists. This time
though the newer pieces preceding it were less convincing. Arne Nordheim's
Tractatus set whirling flute figuration against the ensemble in an all too
familiar rhetorical way, while Minnewater by the Swedish Bent Sorensen (born
1958) began promisingly with a gently lapping study in closely meshed
melodic layers which owed a good deal to Ligeti, but seemed to lose its way
in a flurry of rhythmic activity towards the end. Yet the opportunity to
hear Sorensen's music was a thoroughly useful one; the whole event at The
Place has provided a timely counterpoint to the mainstream events of the
festival.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts: Committed to his own vision - William Packer admires
the work of Norman Blamey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS comforting to think that talent will out, that sooner or later all
artists of any true merit will get their due. Such faith is sorely tested in
the event. Norman Blamey is now 78 and a Royal Academician of some 20 years'
standing and he has shown in every Summer Exhibition of the Royal Academy
since 1938. Yet he works slowly, and to meet his full Academician's quota of
six major works to show each summer stretches him to the limit. Also there
is the apparently narrow range of his subject-matter - the domestic interior
and still-life, the portrait and the figure composition - all submitted to a
calm, detached, unblinking scrutiny and realised with a scrupulous, even
harsh technical precision.
In the context of late 20th century modernism, with its contemptuous
indifference to long, slow, consistency and technical probity, his
commitment to his particular vision might seem, to some eyes, wilfully
old-fashioned. It is at once astonishing and no surprise at all, that this
small retrospective celebration, organised by the admirably
independent-minded Linda Checketts of the the Norfolk Institute at Norwich,
should be only the second one-man exhibition he has ever had - the first a
similarly modest affair at the Roundhouse in Camden Town in the late 1970s.
He is as accomplished and intriguing an artist as any currently at work in
this country. He is even as important, for while he represents no movement
or tendency of the avant-garde the position he has achieved remains entirely
his own, which in itself is significant. For he is an artist, properly
educated in the disciplines of the western realist tradition, who has said
to himself that they will do for him. To look back consciously, as he has
done, to the example of the Flemish masters of the 15th and 16th centuries,
and to van Eyck in particular, has made him no less a painter of his own
time, no less aware of the formal examples afforded by artists from Degas to
Mondrian. It has only set him somewhat apart.
The lesson is that the artist may look and learn, but is under no duty to
follow. And so Blamey, our one present-day pre-Raphaelite, gives us the
clearly articulated pictorial space within which the true appearance of
things may be studied and registered, a space held and defined, four-square,
by screen or mirror, door-frame, table-cloth or altar-front. In the past,
the perspective, which is always meticulously worked out and resolved, has
been forced to a degree, consciously flattening the space and elongating the
figures within it, to mannered, even decorative effect. In more recent
years, that system has eased, giving a more natural and conventional space,
though the definition, both of space and form, remains as rigorous as ever.
The paint surface is rich, but never indulgent in its application - again
every mark, every bloc or element of colour put firmly in its proper place,
incised with the sharp, swift edge of the palette knife. As he says of his
methods in his teaching of life-drawing, the intention, the hope is to
achieve 'intelligent precision rather than emotional swagger.'
Blamey's most obviously ambitious paintings are the large ecclesiastical
compositions of the celebrants and servers at the altar of St Pancras Old
Church, the high anglican church which he has attended all his life. This is
difficult material in every sense, in this sceptical age, and no other
modern artist has taken it on, and on such a scale. Here there is no
visionary or mystical special pleading, but only the simple depiction of the
ritual by which belief is communicated, the principal figures impersonal and
monumental, yet touching in their evident humanity.
Though clearly more personal, the domestic and family compositions are
formally no less ambitious, and turn out to be quite as monumental in the
result. The artist's family around the harmonium, his wife, head on hand, at
the kitchen table, the family again caught in the mirror, the space doubling
and redoubling itself away to infinity - in all these works, the figures are
held either in significant repose or at the definitive, chosen gesture. The
fingers are spread at the keyboard, the hand reaches to turn the page, for
once and for all. These are magnificent, truly monumental paintings, and the
more poignant for touching upon our common experience. Norman Blamey is a
secret we keep too well.
Norman Blamey: The Fine Art Society, 148 New Bond Street, London W1, until
January 8.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts: Held together by syrup - The revival of 'Carousel' at
the National
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST night of Carousel at the Royal National Theatre ended with a
standing ovation, and there is much in Nicholas Hytner's new production of
the old Rodgers and Hammerstein musical that is worthy of applause. I prefer
to walk alone in expressing reservations, but first will acknowledge the
accomplishments.
The production is, of course, terrific. The RNT pulls out all the stops
using all its resources, now supplemented by Cameron Mackintosh, on what is
already a pretty good score. Carousel does not contain very many songs, but
they include the irrepressible 'June is Bustin' Out All Over', which is here
given a magnificent rendering by Patricia Routledge, as well as 'When the
Children Are Asleep'.
It was not the first modern musical to use ballet. Rodgers and Hammerstein
had already done that in Oklahoma] This must be the first revival, however,
which has commissioned a new ballet by a major choreographer - the late
Kenneth MacMillan. The main dance scene, performed by Bonnie Moore and the
Russian, Stanislav Tchassov, is breathtaking, and it is gratifying to see
ballet on the stage of the RNT. The orchestra, led by Rolf Wilson, is first
rate throughout.
There are also marvellous opportunities for sets. The designer Bob Crowley
knows by now how to use them to the full. Apart from the early appearance of
the real carousel, note the scene at the end of the first act where everyone
gets into small boats.
Carousel has a plot of a kind, as well as effects, so there is room for some
acting, notably by Michael Hayden as the central character Billy Bigelow -
called Billy, one assumes, because he is meant to be a good guy at heart,
and Bigelow because while his heart is big, some of his actions are low.
Hayden covers the range.
There is a musical climax in the number that has become the theme song of
the Liverpool football supporters: 'You'll Never Walk Alone'. Sung first by
Ms Routledge, and reprised by the entire cast at the end, it is undoubtedly
powerful.
Not least, Carousel has an interesting background. A series of informative
programme notes reveals that the piece is closely based on a play by the
Hungarian Ferenc Molnar, first performed in Budapest in 1909. Puccini, who
was chasing Molnar's divorced wife, wanted to make an opera of it, but
abandoned it in favour of Turandot. Rodgers and Hammerstein picked up the
English translation and added a happy ending. Molnar saw Carousel in
rehearsal in New York in 1945 and thoroughly approved. Central European
sentimentality had passed to New England and gained an evangelical fervour.
So why do I damn with faint praise and persist in thinking that the recently
revived and contemporaneous Annie Get Your Gun is much to be preferred? The
answer is that Annie is rougher and tougher and has infinitely greater
variety. Annie is a wild figure, a brilliant shot who lays down her gun for
her man. The cast of Carousel looks like a bunch of boy scouts and girl
guides doing The Gang Show, and the only song that approaches Annie in zest
is 'June is Bustin' Out All Over'.
For the rest, Carousel is a musical moral crusade. Any excuse for
sentimentality is seized upon, like singing songs about the joys of having
breakfast in the kitchen. It is also irrational for a character (Bigelow)
who has spent most of his life as a heel and has failed to commit murder
only because the man he was attempting to knife turned out to have a gun
should be sent to the backyard of heaven. I found these scenes ridiculous.
As for 'You'll Never Walk Alone', it is clear that evangelists and football
supporters have a great deal in common. True, it is all done with great
style and technical excellence, but Carousel is held together by syrup. The
production is sponsored by Oracle UK.

THE Christmas holidays are a good time for armchair travel, and what better
than Mark Shand's account of his 1000-kilometre journey through India on an
elephant, Travels On My Elephant, read with sympathetic enthusiasm by Paul
Shelley (Chivers Audio Books CAB 756; 8 cassettes; 8 hours 15 minutes;
unabridged). This is not your average elephant: this is Tara, whom the
author has rescued from a life with professional beggars; for her new owner,
the most satisfying of many adventures with her is the process of becoming
her mahout. Ancient cities, some bawdy company, Tara's terrible hangover
after a well-meant night-cap of two bottles of rum . . . All is colour and
chaos - a lovely listen.
From ancient-and-modern in India to a cloudy corner of Europe in an
different age is the second of Mary Stewart's Arthurian masterpieces, The
Hollow Hills (CAB 749; 12 cassettes; 15 hours 15 minutes; unabridged) is set
in fifth-century Cornwall, Wales and Cumbria, where derelict Roman buildings
are still commonplace and forests cover much of the land: a persuasive
amalgam of history, myth and magic, the narrator is Prince Merlin, who is
secretly bringing up the boy Arthur to take over the throne of Britain. In a
spectacular ending Arthur takes his great sword from out of the fire and is
acknowledged as his father's successor - the High King who will unite all
the peoples of Britain. It is beautifully read by Stephen Thorne, who has
already recorded the earlier part of Merlin's story, Mary Stewart's The
Crystal Cave (CAB 676; 12 cassettes).
As far from Arthurian - or indeed, any - idealism as it could be, Flashman
(CAB 753; 8 cassettes; 10 hours 10 minutes; unabridged) is George MacDonald
Fraser's novel of 1969, which takes up the story of Thomas Hughes's school
bully after he has been expelled from Rugby in Tom Brown's Schooldays. Harry
Flashman has been a soldier. He has even, unwillingly, seen action in the
Afghan wars. Coward, liar, womaniser, self-seeking blackguard as he is, his
chief preoccupation has been to survive, and in 1905 at the age of 80, he
has written his memoires. The background to this irreverent and bawdy saga
is some well-researched military history from the Raj of the mid-19th
century, turning a blackish comedy into something special; a superb reading
by Timothy West.
For really black comedy in a modern setting, Nigel Williams's novel The
Wimbledon Poisoner (CAB 750; 8 cassettes; 10 hours 5 minutes; unabridged),
read by James Saxon, has a lot going for it. Henry Farr, bored City
solicitor commuting from Wimbledon, decides to murder his wife, but that
success eludes him. Other unintended successes crowd in on him, and there
are some very funny passages until the end, when the tension is of a far
less comic kind. Not a set to give to Aunt Edna: the F-word is in constant
use.
For a less burlesque view of contemporary English family life there is
Family Money, Nina Bawden's novel of 1991, in a first-rate reading by
Eleanor Bron (Sterling Audio Books SAB 031; 8 cassettes; 8 hours 19 minutes;
unabridged). Fanny Pye is a comfortably-off widow living alone near the
Regents Canal who is casually beaten up for intervening in a street fight,
with consequences that last and last.
From Random Rouse Audiobooks, there are two highly enjoyable abridged
versions of recent best-sellers. Dick Francis's Driving Force went straight
to the top of the lists, and this reading by Nigel Havers (RC 112; 2
cassettes; 3 hours; abridged) is pure pleasure. The hero, a retired National
Hunt jockey, runs a fleet of horse-boxes and accidentally discovers that
some of them are used to carry odd items in addition to the horses. The
other good listen is Michael Caine's autobiography, What's It All About? (RC
111; 2 cassettes; 3 hours; abridged) read in laid-back style by the author.
There is a good new abridgement of an old favourite, Conan Doyle's The
Valley Of Fear published in 1915 (Listen for Pleasure LFP 7616; 2 cassettes;
2 hours 30 minutes; abridged). A mysterious killing in England, solved by
Sherlock Holmes, receives an admirably strong reading from Martin Jarvis.
Another ever-popular Sherlock Holmes story that has now been re-issued is
The Hound of the Baskervilles (LFP 7607; 2 cassettes; 2 hours; abridged).
The clipped style of the late Hugh Burden's reading catches all the tension
and fear of this tale of the dreaded Hound.
From Schiltron Audio Books come three impressive new single cassettes.
Hunting Shadows (SPN 300-1; l hour) is Tom Gallacher's boyhood memories of
'old Dumbarton' in the 1930s, with Henry Hall on the wireless, full cinemas
and the great merchant shipping fleet in the Clyde. Robert Trotter gives a
delicious reading.
A Wilderness Of Monkeys (SPN 825-2; 1 hour 16 minutes) and Every Inch A King
(SPN 825-3; 1 hour 16 minutes) complete John Cargill Thompson's gossipy
trilogy on the 18th-century theatre in Britain. The former is an account of
his long life from the bawdy, brilliant, quarrelsome old Irish actor,
Charles Macklin (played by Alec Monteath), the greatest Shylock of his
generation, as he lies in his coffin in July 1797. Even David Garrick
(played by John Shedden), who detested Macklin, gives an admiring analysis
of that Shylock. Both these cassettes are vastly entertaining and full of
information, as was the first of the trilogy, Uncorking Old Sherry (SPN
825-1; 1 cassette; 1 hour 25 minutes), performed by Martin Heller and issued
two years ago.
Raymond Briggs's new fable The Man (Random Century Tellastory TS 431; 1
cassette; 84 minutes) receives outstanding performances from Michael Palin
as The Man and 12-year-old William Puttock as The Boy.
A few companies are re-issuing their popular recordings in simplified
packaging at bargain prices. Spoken Word never comes cheap, but these trim
several pounds off earlier prices for the chosen sets. Among such sets
offered by Isis Audio Books is Ellis Peters's Cornish mystery from the
1960s, A Nice Derangement Of Epitaphs (TE 463; 6 cassettes; 6 hours 48
minutes; unabridged). This ingenious tale might seem rather slight, were it
not for the detailed portrait of a modern family in crisis: it is well for
them that one of their new friends is Detective Inspector George Felse. Ian
Ross gives an unhurried and intimate reading.
Chivers Audio Books also has an excellent range of popular successes in
similarly simplified packaging at reduced prices under the label Word For
Word Audio Books. One of my own favourites is Maeve Binchy's Dublin 4 (WFW
103; 4 cassettes; 5 hours 15 minutes; unabridged), four penetrating short
stories set in Dublin, with an enchanting reading by Kate Binchy.
There is also Stephen Thorne reading Ellis Peters's first Brother Cadfael
mystery, A Morbid Taste For Bones; Michael Bryant reading Ruth Rendell's
Inspector Wexford mystery, An Unkindness Of Ravens - one of her best; and
Jonathan Cecil's ineffable reading of PG Wodehouse's Right Ho, Jeeves.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: A precious piece of Richter - Andrew Clements takes
his pick of the year's best releases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO Christmases ago Rene Jacobs' version of Monteverdi's L'Incoronazione di
Poppaea arrived just too late to squeeze into the year's best releases. This
time Jacobs' Il ritorno d'Ulisse (Harmonia Mundi 901427.29, three CDs) has
made it with a month to spare. If the performances are not quite on the
exalted level of Poppaea, there is much admirable singing, especially from
Christoph Pregardien's Ulisse and Bernarda Fink's Penelope, with the
remarkable counter-tenor Dominique Visse appearing in the prologue as
L'Umana fragilita and as Pisandro in the opera proper.
There is also the pleasure of Jacobs' wonderfully flexible, non-dogmatic
direction. With its judicious cuts in some monologues and the interpolation
of early 17th century choruses by other hands where the manuscript is
wanting his musical text may well offend purists, but it produces a
convincing, spirited piece of theatre, sublimely moving in its final scenes.
Many of the most touted operatic sets of the year have proved big
disappointments, but the reissue as a single mid-price set of Karl Bohm's
1960s versions of Wozzeck and Lulu (Deutsche Grammophon) was a much needed
resurrection. Whatever one thinks of the individual performances
(Fischer-Dieskau's Wozzeck and Schoen, Evelyn Lear's Marie and Lulu), Bohm's
conducting and the playing of the Vienna Philharmonic have an idiomatic
sense that no other Berg performances on record have ever captured.
Equally convincing, in its different way, is Anne-Sophie Mutter's brand new
disc of the Berg Violin Concerto, with the Chicago Symphony under Levine (DG
437 093-2). Setting highly wrought solo playing among anguished orchestral
textures the work seems more desperately tragic than ever before; the
coupling, Wolfgang Rihm's very recent Gesungene Zeit, is imaginative and
intriguing, with solo writing tailor-made for Mutter's finely drawn, silvery
tone.
Stravinsky has been served well this year. Best of all were Kent Nagano's
coupling of an uplifting, lithe account of the neglected melodrama
Persephone and a much more than adequate Le Sacre du printemps with the
London Philharmonic (Virgin Classics VCK 791511-2, two CDs); and Boulez's
crystalline account of the exquisite Le Rossignol with the BBC Symphony and
a first-rate cast headed by Phyllis Bryn-Julson and Felicity Palmer (Erato
2292 45627-2).
Of the large crop of discs of Debussy's orchestral music, the clear winner
was Michael Tilson Thomas's ravishing Jeux, Prelude a l'apres-midi and, the
clincher, La Boite a joujoux with the London Symphony at the top of its
considerable current form (Sony).
Contemporary music now comes on disc from all directions. In its quiet way
the Paris-based Disques Montaigne has established itself now as one of the
most important labels for contemporary music, concentrating on the European
mainstream with issues this year taking in Xenakis and Kagel, Nono, Rihm and
Aperghis. Rihm's voluminous output is hard to survey on disc but the
collection of three string quartets (Nos 3, 5 and 8, Disques Montaigne
782008) played by the Arditti Quartet offered a handy chart of his
expressive range, while Irvine Arditti's version of Nono's late solo-violin
meditation La Lontananza nostalgica utopica futura (Disques Montaigne
782004) offers an intensely intimate, absorbing experience.
Nearer home, NMC has continued its invaluable series of discs devoted to
contemporary British composers. It was good to have an album devoted to the
Composers' Ensemble's imaginative Songbook project, the inspiration of the
soprano Mary Wiegold and the composer John Woolrich to invite more than 50
composers to write short settings for the group. The CD (NMC 005) samples 14
of them, though the quality inevitably varies; Birtwistle's crystalline
setting of Paul Celan's 'White and Light', and Dominic Muldowney's intense
version of Brecht's 'On Suicide' are the highlights. NMC also offered the
first disc devoted to James Dillon (NMC d004), containing three of his most
impressive pieces. Even the most sceptical follower of Dillon's progress
will be convinced by East 11th St NY 10003 for six percussionists from 1982,
which has a grip on structure and articulation that some of his music
lacked.
Finally scraping in, literally in the last post, a new concert recording
from Sviatoslav Richter instantly commands attention. Recorded at the Yamaha
Centre in Vienna during his 1989 European tour it consists of a series of
the small-scale contemporary works with which Richter has consistently
spiced his recitals - Stravinsky's Piano-Rag-Music, Webern's Variations,
Hindemith Suite 1922 - and which he plays with a flair that is peculiarly
his own (Decca 436 451-2, two CDs). The sound is not perfect - distant,
slightly noisy - but new recordings from the greatest of living pianists are
precious things.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts: Proper approach to words - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
LISTENERS in the London area have drama from the LBC as well as the BBC, and
a lot of it comes out of the Woolwich Young Playwrights Awards, sponsored by
the Woolwich Building Society. The ten winners in the 1992 competition, out
of 335 entries, received their awards on Tuesday at the Purcell Room. The
winning plays will be heard first on LBC, then touring on 14 independent
local radio stations and 8 BBC local services.
Drama may also be found on Radio Clyde, and I have just heard their A
Fugitive Day, by Robert Forrest. It is a kind of thriller, but the weapons
are nerves, not guns. Emma (Sybil Wintrope) describes her dreams to
psychologist James Weaver (Ian Hogg), to see if they fit into his studies on
synchronicity. We are not told, but I may tell you now, that the events of
the dream correspond with the events of James's naughty night with Louise,
who later died. In a well-wrought story, we hear of more unhappy
synchronicities until James, re-enacting the Louise night with Emma, is
driven out of his mind. Emma has in fact been put up to it by James's wife
Anne (Celia Imrie). The adroit direction is by Finlay Welch.
Radio 3's Sunday piece was Michael Hastings's Tom and Viv. The marriage of
TS Eliot and Vivienne Haig-Wood, its subject, was indeed pathetic, she
driven mad by ill-judged drugs, he driven near it by her madness; but in the
play, Tom and Viv are just ordinary people in difficulties, no doubt why
Hastings masked their superiority under their nicknames. Of its kind, it is
not a bad play, but not a very good one; and though Miranda Richardson is a
convincing Vivienne, John Duttine is no Eliot, whatever he is described as
doing. Sue Wilson's direction allows fine work from the supporting players.
I was put off Frank Delaney's Word of Mouth (Radio 4, Mondays) because Radio
3 was doing Words at the same time; but I approve its properly oldfashioned
approach. It has dealt with the 'less' and 'fewer' matter, and, in response
to listeners' letters, this week brought up 'different to' and so on. They
taught me about such things in the fifth form at school, and it distresses
me that they do not figure universally in our nationalised education. One
good thing about the question of women's ordination is that broadcasters
have learnt to pronounce 'schism' (even if they still put the extra 'r' into
'law and order'). Now let us all say 'on the ground that', singular, when
there is only one ground.
Frankly, though, I doubt if requiring decent English from people who care
little about it is one of broadcasting's major duties. Better teach us to be
understood in other tongues, as Radio 5 so attractively does in its three
Sunday evening programmes on conversational French, Italian and German. No
language teacher I; no great linguist either, but these half-hours seem to
me worth their weight in gold.
I wrote lately about The Locker Room on Radio 4, men telling one another
about their interests. I did not, and I do not, find it very interesting.
But at least it is better than Knowing Me, Knowing You, also Radio 4 -
another programme from the same mould, only commoner and rather dirtier. Are
we seeing radio's counter-attack on feminism?
A Book at Bedtime (Radio 4) is usually well-chosen. It is currently using
short stories, though Fay Weldon's The School Run was long enough to go over
two evenings. You could say that it dealt only with everyday concerns of
mature women moving to the country - but it is written by Fay Weldon, which
would have guaranteed its unusual felicity even if it had not been so
likeably read by Julie Christie. There are some more Weldon-Christies to
come.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: CDs for 30somethings - An ever-widening classical
range
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT TO do when the kids are shut away in another room with the latest
Nintendo blockbuster? They say the over-35s are the least likely group to
spend their money on video games and the record companies certainly seem to
be waking up to that fact: this year has brought an ever wider range of
classical music on to the CD market.
The major achievement in 1992 has been the completion of the series devoted
to Purcell's Odes and Welcome Songs by The King's Consort. I do not know if
this enterprise was intended as the beginning of a long-term retrospective
of the composer's work, but it has turned out that way. As Purcell's
tercentenary year approaches in 1995, other large-scale projects (including
the same company's choral music series) look set to follow its lead.
In the end, the complete set of Odes (Hyperion CDS 44031/8) has stretched to
eight volumes. Most include works never previously recorded, of which this
year's Volume 7 (CDA 66587) has some particularly good examples. All are
typical 17th-century ceremonial pieces, written with wit, grace and
invention to amuse their audiences. If only the custom of greeting
individual members of the royal family with 'welcome songs' had lived on;
whatever would today's poets and composers make of such a delightful duty?
Another project well underway is EMI's undertaking to issue all of Elgar's
electric recordings on CD. Two volumes have appeared so far (EMI CDS
754560-2 and CDS 754564-2) and both make highly recommendable purchases. The
sound, dating from the 1920s, is far better than one might expect thanks to
the quality of these CD transfers and no subsequent performances have ever
equalled the exhilaration of hearing Elgar conducting his own music.
What can too often sound heavy and ponderous today was never meant like that
at all. At first, it may come as a surprise to hear the composer himself
slice ten minutes off the usual duration of the Enigma Variations, but
delight soon takes over, as today's listener gets into the spirit of it all.
That comes on the second volume; Volume 1 contains the symphonies and is the
essential buy of the two.
A series which still has a lot further to go is the Hyperion Schubert
Edition. This has arguably been its most successful year to date. Some of
the best-known singers in the series so far have been discovering some of
the lesser-known Schubert songs. Individual volumes, each offering a
programme of manageable size, are easily the best way of coming to know and
love this unrivalled song treasury. Both Thomas Hampson's theme of classical
antiquity (Hyperion CDJ 33014) and Margaret Price's songs of sunset (CDJ
33015) make very rewarding CDs.
A couple of the duets on Hampson's disc remind me that the unforgettable
collection of Schubert duets by Janet Baker and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau has
re-appeared, though with the dull vocal trios and quartets added to make a
double-CD pack (DG 435 596-2). A brief recommendation also for the latest
volume of the Gershwin musicals, Lady, Be Good] (Elektra Nonesuch
7559-79308-2), a 1920s show, which includes the song 'Fascinating Rhythm'
and echoes of the charleston. That would set the toes tapping over
Christmas.
The new opera sets have generally been less exciting, but after a gap of
about a decade Massenet suddenly seems to be in favour again. His Cherubin,
the further adventures of Mozart's Cherubino, had its first ever recording
this year. The story is pretty weak, but as soon as he comes across a
passage with amorous leanings, Massenet is able to turn up the heat under
the music's collar. The cast, including Frederica von Stade in trousers yet
again as the lusty young hero, is starry (RCA 09026-60593-2).
Finally, a choice that looks to the past and the future. Tchaikovsky was
composer of the year at the Edinburgh Festival just gone and Mariss Jansons
the most exciting conductor there. We did not actually get Jansons in The
Nutcracker, but EMI's new recording (CDS 754 600-2) has remedied that -
ideal music for the festive season and a foretaste of 1993, the centenary of
the composer's death. By next Christmas you probably will not want to hear
another note of Tchaikovsky ever again.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: Pearls plucked from the CD flood - Among this
year's pleasures for David Murray was a literary song-cycle by Alexander
Goehr
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEING IN no position to declare 'Best Records of the Year", I shall simply
catalogue some happy finds. Doing even modest justice to the annual flood of
CDs would be a full-time occupation in itself, let alone trying to sample
everything that is released. The situation is made no easier by the big
record companies' current preference for putting their money on Great
Performing Names (and a handful of the most popular operas), while the
smaller companies pursue exciting new artists and the under-explored
stretches of the repertoire.
So, first: Alexander Goehr's 1990 song-cycle Sing, Ariel, on
Unicorn-Kanchana DKP (CD)9129, with Lucy Shelton's principal soprano abetted
by Eileen Hulse and Sarah Leonard, and with Oliver Knussen conducting a
curious little ensemble of top-class players - two strings (top and bottom),
piano, tenor sax/bass clarinet and trumpet. Goehr exploits his quintet for
an astonishing range of colour and weight, from intimate to declamatory. The
trick of enlisting shadow-sopranos (an inspiration from Janacek's Diary?)
enhances the dramatic variety further still.
Characteristically, Goehr asked Sir Frank Kermode to recommend texts for
this ambitious, extended cycle; characteristically again, Kermode presented
him with a rich but unobvious haul from Shakespeare, Campion and Spenser to
Auden, Wallace Stevens and Paul Hollander, from suggestive fragments to
whole poems, grouped so as to hint at underlying themes. (Goehr has long
been a conscientious academic, properly respectful of experts in other
subjects.) The collaboration has had a wonderful outcome: I doubt whether
any other Goehr project has answered so beautifully to his best strengths.
From his stern serialist beginnings, Goehr has always yearned after the
expressive potential of tonal harmony - not to retreat to Bruckner and early
Schoenberg, but to tap the power of tonal functions without pretending to
return to major / minor keys. Sing, Ariel at last does that with perfect
assurance, and no sense of compromise. Its harmonies are translucent (the
dissonance-factor is low: nothing to frighten the horses), and superbly
imagined for its peculiar ensemble. The vocal line switches easily from sub
rosa confessional tones to conversational ones and to public passion, and
invariably it carries the words with sharp musical sense.
I look forward to much closer acquaintance with this cycle, which for nearly
an hour marries Goehr's fastidious musicianship to exact feeling, mature and
complicated. Nothing really comparable comes to mind but David Blake's Heine
cycle, From the Mattress-Grave (still gravely under-noticed). Other
listeners owe it to themselves to discover Sing, Ariel; those who think
their defences proof against all music in Schoenberg's wake may be disarmed
and won over.
Quicker notices: Michael Tilson Thomas and the LSO have recorded the fullest
and best-ordered version yet of Debussy's music for Le Martyre de Saint
Sebastien, d'Annunzio's deeply unhealthy 1911 theatre-piece (homoerotic,
sado-masochistic), on Sony SK 48 240. With Leslie Caron as narratrix, it
conveys the shape of the score and the drama as never before, while paring
the spoken text to a point where non-French-speakers need not be impelled
toward the fast-forward button.
Le Martyre inspired Debussy's last nakedly 'lush' music - with further
inspiration from Parsifal; it was a turning-point, which you need to know in
order to hear his later, more astringent pieces in proper perspective. Hand
on heart, I should have to say that Tilson Thomas's three attractive
sopranos are less androgynously 'white' than Debussy would have expected,
and that some Puccini-conductors can wring more unmanning magic from his
divisi string-writing than TT does here. He captures the visionary breadth
of the whole score nonetheless.
Sony SK 48093 offers 'Discovered Treasures' from the Horowitz legacy: ie
never-published takes from recording sessions between 1962 and 1972 when the
great pianist was still in his late prime, not in his elderly, wobbly years.
The 'programme' here runs from a half-dozen captivating Scarlatti sonatas
through Bach-Busoni and Clementi to Medtner and Skryabin, and every part of
it bears the inimitable Horowitz stamp, high-definition and huge vitality.
More Medtner, the 2nd and 3rd Piano Concerti, flows magisterially from
Nikolai Demidenko's fingers (Hyperion CDA66580). There is an authentic
virtuoso crunch in Marc-Andre Hamelin's extraordinary performance of Alkan's
monster Concerto for solo piano, too (Music &amp; Arts CD-724). The young
Siberian violinist Maxim Vengerov rises to feats of the same breathtaking
order, though serenely musical, in a concert-programme with Mehta and the
Israel Philharmonic on Teldec 9031-73266-2.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: Joyous treasures from less explored territory -
This year's opera delights have been new recordings of Rameau and Massenet
rather than Verdi and Wagner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CURIOUS year for opera on record: while new versions of mainstream operas
 -Rossini, Verdi, Puccini, Wagner, Strauss - were almost all disappointing,
leaving one to wonder why the companies bothered in the first place,
ventures into less familiar territory brought bounty. For me perhaps the
most joyful venture of all was Les Arts Florissants' dazzling account of Les
Indes galantes, a Rameau opera-ballet that is at once pageant, spectacle and
melodic feast: irresistible 18th-century entertainment (French Harmonia
Mundi HMC 901367.69)
Two examples of the rarer Massenet afforded illumination as well as
pleasure. The very last opera, Cleopatre, taken live by Koch Schwann (314
064 K3) at the 1990 St Etienne Festival, discloses a subtly drawn, tautly
concentrated chamber work, set within Grand Opera trappings. RCA's Cherubin
(09026-60593-2) offers a starrier (Von Stade, Ramey, June Anderson) yet also
less stylish brand of Massenet: but the work itself, from earlier in the
'final period', is a delight - light, sentimental, charming, melodically
memorable.
The new Lyons Opera version of Poulenc's Dialogues des Carmelites (Virgin
Classics 7 59227 2), conducted by Kent Nagano, does not render obsolete
EMI's celebrated original-cast one: what it does achieve, is a powerful new
light on a remarkable 20th-century opera. Collins Classics's speed in
placing on disc the Opera North premiere performance of Robert Saxton's
Caritas (1991) is wholly praiseworthy: a bold first opera, with obvious
weaknesses but also an entirely unobvious voice of its own, and a heroine's
role distinctive and fascinating (Collins Classics 13502).
Philips launched its long-term relationship with the Kirov Opera with a
superbly impassioned Khovanshchina, conducted by Valery Gergiev (432 147-2):
the rough-hewn epic of Russia at a point of historical change has never
seemed more unnervingly 'relevant', or more grandly gripping.
The reissue in a single money-for-value package of Karl Bohm's 1960s DG sets
of Berg's Wozzeck and Lulu, both with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau and Evelyn
Lear, provides not just a great bargain but a revelation of great opera
conducting - at once 'traditional' and forward-looking, idiomatically
shapely and muscular (DG 435 705-2). The year of the Rossini bicentenary,
miserably thin on new goodies, did encourage EMI to reprint on CD three
examples of Vittorio Gui's glory as a Rossini conductor. The Glyndebourne
Cenerentola (CMS 7 64183 2), Count Ory (CMS 7 64180 2) and even the Barber
with Victoria de los Angeles (CMS 7 64162 2) may no longer count as the last
word in Rossini singing: but nonetheless, what Rossinian bliss]
Another 1992 peg - the Barcelona Olympics and other Spanish Big Events  -
prompted the record companies to hang on it a great number of compilation
reissues from their Iberian back-catalogues. Decca's four two-disc boxes of
'Musica para piano', Spanish piano music from Soler to Mompou via Albeniz,
Granados and Falla, sneaked their way into my record-players again and
again: Alicia de Larrocha's peerless skills in this repertory, her gifts of
truthfulness, vivacity and calm, demanded no less. Sviatoslav Richter's
1957, 1959 and 1965 Schumann recordings for DG come up as an even more
treasurable reissue, subtle and secretive in atmosphere yet also thrillingly
bold and broad (435 751-2).
Richter accompanies Oleg Kagan and Yury Bashmet in live accounts, from
Moscow in the 1980s, of the Shostakovich Violin and Viola Sonatas: bleak
music, its agonies nakedly exposed, and here expounded with magnificently
firm authority (Melodiya SUCD 10-00095). Alfred Schnittke, the most
important Shostakovich successor, is now the modern composer most favoured
by record companies; among the many Schnittke issues of 1992 I gained most
reward from Natalya Gutman's account of the First Cello Concerto (coupled
with the Schumann, EMI CDC 7 54443 2) and Rostropovich's of the Second
(coupled with In Memoriam, Sony SK 48241). The best of Schnittke's wild,
uneven, unabashed inspiration is here.
John Eliot Gardiner and his English Baroque Soloists and Monteverdi Choir,
annual heroes of these record round-ups, demand their place yet again. Two
DG Archiv choral records - a lovely Beethoven collection with the Mass in C
as its focus (433 391-2) and a marvellously robust Haydn Seasons (431 818-2)
 -make exhilaratingly fresh sounds, fresh statements about the music. In
performances of this order, the great Early Music adventure continues with
all its exploratory zeal intact.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: A pagan voice for Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY OF the records I have enjoyed this year have been choral music of
various kinds. The new issue of Delius's Sea Drift (Argo 430 206-2) by the
WNO chorus and orchestra under Sir Charles Mackerras is a winner. Mackerras
gives Delius a keen edge and firm propulsion - no drowsiness. The ocean
swell is wonderfully caught and the Welsh chorus tone has the tang of salt
spray. Thomas Hanson's baritone solo is first-rate. For once the vocal line
does not sound as if it had been stuck on afterwards. Every word (Whitman in
anthropomorphic mood) tells. The fill-up is the Florida Suite.
Sir Charles Groves takes a less lean and athletic view of Delius but his
1972 Mass of Life (with the LPO and their Choir) comes up rousingly on
transfer to EMI CMS 7 64218 2 (two CDs). The companion pieces are the Songs
of sunset and Arabesque, with the Royal Liverpool PO and Choir and eminent
soloists - Harper, Baker, Watts, Tear, Luxon, Shirley-Quirk. Luxon's singing
of the important baritone solos in the Mass is notable. The way Baker
combines intensity with simplicity in the fourth of the Sunset songs is
extraordinary.
The pagan Delius might have reacted sarcastically to his music being
recommended for Christmas. If this worries you, go carolling with Richard
Hickox, the LSO and Chorus and the St Paul's Cathedral choristers, in two
seasonable works by Vaughan Williams (EMI CDC 7 54128). The Fantasia on
Christmas Carols (1912) is an interweaving of traditional tunes. The
anthology-cantata Hodie ('This Day' - 1954) is longer and stranger:
choruses, solos with beautiful word setting, gospel narrations not spoken
but sung, mostly by the boys, rich orchestration, words from many poets
including Milton, George Herbert and Hardy. Is it the inclusion, in a
central position, of Hardy's The Oxen, that introduces a gentle element of
questioning? Christmas music with a difference, well worth trying.
Or, as a perfect antidote to late-Romanticism, listen to the Pilgrim songs
and dances from the Libre vermell (Red Book) of Montserrat, persuasively
brought to life by Philip Pickett and the New London Consort (Oiseau-Lyre
433 186-2). Many travellers to Barcelona will have visited the famous
monastery up in the mountains, half-hidden in a cluster of monstrous rocks
like swollen organ pipes. The Red Book, completed in 1399, one of the
Montserrat's library treasures, contains ten pieces for voices and
instruments for use by pilgrims. They were warned to do them 'with respect
and moderation' and to avoid lewdness and lasciviousness. The Consort
players have the easy conviction which now marks the best early music
playing. Gone (almost) are the days of squeak and scratch.
A new CD which should not be overlooked is EMI's Musique vocale francaise
(CDC 7 54452 2) by the Groupe vocal de France under their its expert English
conductor John Alldis. Debussy's Three poems by Charles d'Orleans for
unaccompanied chorus are among his choicest small works. Ravel's Trois
chansons are here too, with Milhaud's outwardly simple, but deeply felt Six
sonnets on 'secret' poems written during the Occupation by Jean Cassou. A
distinguished collection, completed with works by Schmitt and Sauguet. Alas,
words not included.
A pleasant surprise during the year has been the number of recordings for
Milhaud's centenary. To those I reviewed some weeks ago can be added two
more in the series of live performances from Prague, where links with
Milhaud go back to the 1920s. One 'volume' has works connected with Provence
(PR 250 013) with the choral Cantique du Rhone, the Eighth Symphony
('Rhodanian') and the idyllic 'Chenimee du Roi Rene for wind quintet. The
other is centred on the Czech capital (PR 250 012), with the bracing,
combative Music for Prague, and the Concertino d'hiver (trombone and
strings).
Enthusiasts for the unique Spanish mezzo Conchita Supervia will fall upon
Pearl's anthology The unknown Supervia (GEMM CD 9969). They will be well
rewarded in spite of variable sound quality. Operatic arias, zarzuela
excerpts and a host of mainly Spanish and Catalan songs but including John
Alden Carpenter's 'When I bring to you coloured toys'. Best of all, Bizet's
'Les adieux de l'hotesse arabe'. With Supervia's inimitable command of vocal
colour and verbal inflection, this song is transformed into a miniature
drama.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Records: Standard Joe is pick of the jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO DEFINE the 'best' jazz CDs of the year would be to exclude everything
else that was worthwhile in a good year. It might be more useful to point up
those discs which, had you spent the year in tank immersion therapy, you
should go and buy, as soon as you are dry, to catch up. Thus, there are no
re-issues here.
Start with Joe Henderson's Lush Life (Verve 314 511 779) and The Standard
Joe (Red 123248). Loathe as I am to follow popular consensus, Henderson's
stately tenor sound has overshadowed anything else heard this year. His
spaciously constructed treatment of the music of Billy Strayhorn has a
dreamlike clarity. Vibrato-less and bone smooth, the tenor swoops and swings
gracefully in trio, quartet and quintet settings, alongside and inside the
golden tone of trumpeter Wynton Marsalis. Solo or in duet with young
Christian McBride's bass, Henderson's matured improvisation is rich in
melancholic detail, with 'Isfahan' and 'Lush Life' itself. The Standard Joe,
an earlier date, contains similarly exquisite treatment of standards like
'Blue Bossa' and 'Round Midnight', this time with regular sidemen Rufus Reid
(bass) and Al Foster (drums).
To come up to date with what the younger, more impetuous jazz generation
have been doing to the music, get hold of a copy of The Vibe (BMG/Novus
PD90668), trumpeter Roy Hargrove's third date. Twenty-three years old and
touring a tight young quintet, Hargrove gives hope to those who thought
attacking jazz trumpet died with Lee Morgan. Unencumbered by diffidence,
Hargrove's trumpet burns bright and long against the boppy pyrotechnics of
pianist Marc Carey and drummer Gregory Hutchinson who uses a bass drum the
size of a biscuit tin. Antonio Hart, a shooting star in his own right,
weaves around Hargrove effortlessly with the alto. (Interestingly,
Hutchinson also appears on Lush Life and both he and pianist Carey learnt
their chops with singer Betty Carter.)
Having found out what young Americans are doing, discover next the state of
the art in the UK with tenorist Courtney Pine's To The Eyes Of Creation
(Island 9998 514044). As 'commercial' as he is deep, Pine could tame an army
of quickstepping cobras with the soprano and still have the breath to unfurl
a measured reggae ballad on tenor. The definitive sound of London jazz, Pine
moves easily between soul and the squeaky stuff and with this sixth album
defies all those who said he done too much, much too young.
Unlike Pine, who has been a part of the home jazz scene since the music was
rediscovered by the big labels at the end of the 1980s, South Afri can
pianist Bheki Mseleku seemed to drop out of the sky on to an unsuspecting
public on a new label. In Celebration (World Circuit WCD 028) he is joined
by the tenors of Pine and fellow World Circuit player Jean Toussaint, driven
by the sophisticated poly-rhythm section of Marvin 'Smitty' Smith (drums)
and Michael Bowie (upright bass). The swaying compositions are all his own
and with his unhampered Bud Powell inflected playing he carries with them an
uncut emotion that has become a trademark of South African jazz.
Another surprise landing on the family welcome mat was Tee Vee
(Warner/veraBra 2050) from Australian pianist Paul Grabowsky. A hideously
conceived cover conceals an album of catchy Grabowsky compositions which
combine Bill Evans' lines with a funky back beat. Well placed spaces in this
extremely likeable debut are filled with furious scribbling from the tenor
of Dale Barlow and the bristling 'bone of Simon Kent.
But if on emerging from isolation you discover that it is still raining and
Jazz FM is playing the same Sade song, you may wish to return whence you
came. To help with the meditation take a handful of typically transcendental
ECM discs such as Keith Jarrett's Vienna, John Surman's Adventure Playground
or Hal Russell's Hal's Bells with you. As an alternative to the mainstream,
this year's output from Munich has been exhilarating and eclectic as ever.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Drink: Wonderful whisky - and cheese tasting of old tyres -
You can eat and drink well in Orkney, says Giles MacDonogh, but you have to
know where to look
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH

ORKNEY has been in the news a lot this year, and for all the wrong reasons.
If you can bear the caprices of the weather it can be a pretty good place.
During the day at least, Kirkwall buzzes and St Magnus has a surprisingly
magnificent, red sandstone, romanesque cathedral. If you prefer something
older, there is the eery Neolithic tomb at Maes Brae or the prehistoric
village at Skara Brae on the west coast.
Nor is Orkney to be sneezed at for its food and drink. Meat is good here. As
the old saying goes the Orcadians were farmers with boats while the
Shetlanders were fishermen with crofts.
There is delicious lamb from South Ronaldsay (though not quite the equal of
Shetland lamb - possibly the best in the British Isles) and excellent beef.
Much of the cheese is disappointing - as one Orcadian told me: 'Orcadians
like a good squeaky cheese.' By 'squeaky cheese' they mean Dunlop. Nine
times out of ten I would prefer to chew the homonymous tyre than a Dunlop
cheese. Fortunately for the islanders Mrs Hilda Seator (tel: 0856-76318)
makes a simple, lightly pressed curd cheese from raw milk on her farm at
Grimbister in Firth. The cheese is sold in its natural state or flavoured
with chives, garlic or walnuts. It is best from May to October.
On the site of the old airfield in Kirkwall, Bill Jolly and his sister, Liz
Johnson, run a smokehouse which uses a traditional cure and kiln (tel:
085687- 2417.)
Orkney also possesses a good restaurant; the most northerly to receive a
full entry in this year's Good Food Guide. The Creel (tel: 085683-311) is in
St Margaret's Hope on South Ronaldsay. It is approached by crossing one of
the 'Churchill Barriers' constructed by Italian POWs during the war to keep
marauding German U-boats out of Scapa. In their spare time the Italians
built the charming Roman Catholic chapel on Lamb Holm. At The Creel Alan
Craigie produces a remarkably soignee menu using the best of the islands'
produce. The evening I dined there we had an exquisite fish soup and some
rather under-hung teal. One of Caraigie's specialities is the 'bere
bannocks' he makes from Orkney 'bere' barley. He needs to pay a little more
attention to his wine list. The restaurant opens only on Friday and Saturday
from November to March. There are rooms.
If all this were not enough, Orkney has the Raven Brewery making real ales
and two distilleries: Allied's Scapa and Matthew Gloag's Highland Park.
Scapa's production is minute and mostly used for blending, though Gordon &amp;
Macphail bottled a 1979 (Pounds 20.59 from Augustus Barnett) which has a
light, creamy style.
Bottles of Scapa tend to lurk round the back of the fruit cordials in Orkney
pubs, while the rival Highland Park rides high on the optics. The whisky has
a distinct, 'island' character largely as a result of the heavy peating of
the malt produced from the distillery's own kilns. Unlike most of the other
Scottish distilleries, which still kiln a part of their malt requirements,
Highland Park uses manual labour to turn the damp barley. It is notoriously
backbreaking work and after days at work with a spade the workers get a
particular form of cramp called 'malt monkey.' I took a turn with the spade
and decided it was not for me. It was more pleasant to stand with the malt
in the kiln - until I came out smelling like a kipper. Highland Park kilns
about 20 per cent of its malt and that part represents the only malt to lend
its smokey 'phenolic' character to the whisky. The rest of the malt comes in
from the mainland. Having so much barley lying around makes the distillery
prey to rodents. Highland Park fights them off with three cats called Peat,
Malt and Barley. At Laphroaig on the island of Islay they claim the job is
done by a family of stoats.
Highland Park's stills are rather squat. The distillery manager Jim
Robertson, caught me giving them the once over: '. . . and we haven't got
the lightest and blandest whisky either,' he quipped. The whisky is run off
at a comparatively low alcoholic degree, giving a richer, more 'phenolic'
character. A certain amount of sherry wood houses the young spirit to round
it off with some fruit notes.
Highland Park's bread and butter is the 12-year-old (Pounds 19.99 from
Oddbins) a superbly balanced malt with just a hint of peat behind the
heathery nose.
For around Pounds 80 a bottle, Highland Park releases a small amount of 1967
 -retailed through specialists only. It has a far heavier peat character, a
touch of seaweed overlaying the crystallised fruit and heather, and
excellent proof against the vagaries of the Orkney weather.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Food: Beware of food book show-offs - Philippa Davenport
selects the culinary gloss from the dross among this year's titles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE extravagant 1980s I lamented the trend for show-off cookbooks:
oversized, over-illustrated and overpriced - featherweight material in
heavyweight guise. Alas, the flood of ghastly volumes continues in the
so-called caring 1990s.
Probably the worst this year is The Tiffany Gourmet Cookbook (Doubleday
Pounds 30). It is pure advertorial with menus for entertaining supplied by
'names', photographed in their properties, every one of them awash with
Tiffany merchandise. Soft sell for the soft in the head.
Recipes are relegated to the back of the book, hidden behind the green baize
door so to speak, and useless to British cooks anyway. The first - and last
 -I turned to called for 12 doves, cleaned, one-third of a stick of butter
and a large Dutch oven.
From the ridiculous to the sublime, the first book I would choose to buy or
give as a present this Christmas is Maggie Black's Medieval Cookbook
(British Museum Press, Pounds 14.99). Sumptuous and richly informative with
recipes that work if you care to cook them, this is a model of how
historical cookery books should be done.
Christina Hardyment dips into more recent history in Home Comfort (Viking,
Pounds 18.99). Her quest to establish exactly how our ancestors kept
themselves clean, warm and well-fed explores kitchens, laundries,
bakehouses, brewhouses, dairies, larders, stillrooms, dovecotes, fishponds
and so on, tracing their histories and examining the ways they were managed
and run.
The background that this quiet sleuthing brings ('domestic archaeology' as
the author calls it), makes visiting stately homes all the more rewarding.
This book does not need colour illustrations and it has not got them. It is
altogether a pleasing and unpretentious history of domestic arrangements.
A nice little item I do not expect to find in the best seller list, is the
book of the octopus, entitled 8 x 8 = 8 by Haris and Alexander Kalligas. It
is quirky and delightful, just the thing for an erudite stocking filler. It
costs Pounds 8.50 and can be obtained from Alsos Books, 14 Ashbridge Street,
London NW8 8DM. Tel: 071-724-6774. Fax: 071-724-5294.
Foreign cuisines continue to form a major part of many cookery lists. Italy
is still the most popular country, but Spain is the new contender with
champion supporters in Jose Maria Sevilla - about whose book and television
series, Spain on a Plate, (BBC Books Pounds 14.95) I wrote earlier this year
 -and Pepita Aris.
The Spanishwoman's Kitchen (Cassell, Pounds 16.99) is the second in a series
celebrating the relationship between food and landscape - The Frenchwoman's
Kitchen by Brigitte Tilleray came first. The idea is that the author
journeys through a country meeting the local women, eating and cooking with
them, to take the true pulse of the regions.
Aris is more painstaking than Tilleray, less fun in a way, but every bit as
rewarding, if not more so. Aris's writing (and she writes at length) is
vivid, but not purple, though she has an endearing weakness for exclamation
marks. The recipes are detailed and easy to follow. This is a book to read
now and take with you on self-catering holidays in Spain.
Yan-kit So's Classic Food of China (Macmillan, Pounds 25) will, surely,
become a classic itself and prove as successful as her first, prizewinning,
book. I admire it but do not warm to it, alas. I recognise that this is my
fault, not hers, but I seem quite unable to get to grips with cuisines
rooted in a culture so different from the European one. Cooks less hidebound
than me will rejoice.
Our own islands feature strongly this year. In an Irish Country Kitchen by
Clare Connery (Weidenfeld and Nicholson, Pounds 18.99) is not a book that
sings with joy or bubbles with the personality of its author. The pictures
are nostalgically pretty, the prose is plain, the information conscientious
and carefully researched. This makes it sound dull, which it is not, but it
is perhaps a little more staid than one would wish. The recipes are by the
nature of the book not new but they are a sound collection and many of them
are very appetising. This is an honourable record of traditional Irish
cookery and successfully fills a gap in my kitchen library.
Delicious Home Cooking by Caroline Conran (Marks &amp; Spencer, Pounds 14.99) is
altogether more sparky. This is a recipe book full of familiar things
(together with some less familiar things). Often Conran gives her own
personal twists, but discreetly, so that the original character of the
classic dishes is not spoiled. This is the sort of food I like most - to
cook and to eat - and I shall use this book greedily. Pity about the large
format and lavish photography. They may boost sales but . . .
Colin Spencer is a staunch torchbearer for vegetarianism and against factory
farming. Vegetable Pleasures (Fourth Estate, Pounds 9.99) is a selection of
pieces written for his column in The Guardian during the past 12 years. Not
being a reader of that newspaper, it is all new to me and I much enjoyed his
outspoken, opinionated, often controversial and hilarious outpourings. I
approve hugely of the fact that this book is a paperback original: a good
read, good recipes and good value.
But the most exciting recipes come in books from two young writers. First
Annie Bell's dazzling Feast of Flavours (Bantam, Pounds 14.99) to which I
devoted a column when it was published early in the year. It continues to
enthrall. She is a truly original cook.
Then there is Nigel Slater. He is not in the same class as Annie Bell but he
has a strong feel for bright, breezy, contemporary, cosmopolitain style.
High quality fresh ingredients are important to him and he is wisely wary of
doing too much to them. The Marie Claire Cookbook (Hamlyn, Pounds 16.99) is
a compilation of Slater's work for that magazine, with recipes spelled out
in full and larger than life close-up photographs of the food, red hot from
the oven or sizzling in the pan.
Real Fast Food (Michael Joseph, Pounds 14.99) on the other hand, as the
title implies, keeps a close eye on the clock and is suitably telegraphic.
Snacks and supper dishes outnumber dinner party offerings. The pages are
packed with recipe ideas rather than recipes proper, many of them not only
very enticing in their own right but first rate for triggering ideas of
one's own. This doubles the appeal, I reckon. Neither Slater's writing nor
his cooking is laboured. There is liveliness, freshness and intelligence in
all that he does.
The Tenth Muse by Harry Luke (Rubicon Press, Pounds 12.95), first published
in 1954 and revised and reprinted this year, is a delightful book and one
that does not really fit into any particular category. Luke was a scholar, a
keen traveller and a gourmet with an adventurous appetite. He was also a
charming and witty man. This book is a potpourri of recipes and notes
collected in the course of eating his way round the globe.
Apart from the enormously varied recipes, there are some marvellous quotes,
including a report from The Times in 1935 describing a royal dinner of roast
cygnets. My favourite, in a final chapter on culinary don'ts, advises
against cooking the sort of dinner which one of the guests, when asked how
he had fared, described as follows: 'If the soup had been as hot as the
claret, the claret as old as the bird, and the bird had had the breast of
the parlourmaid, it would have been a damned good dinner'.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts (Christmas Entertainment): Singing (most of the time) -
Malcolm Rutherford recommends a few London shows guaranteed to cheer you up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are no pantomimes in mainstream London this year. However, there is a
relatively recent crop of shows in the West End which are guaranteed to
cheer you up.
Start with a musical. Annie Get Your Gun at the Prince of Wales Theatre
contains more favourite songs than you would believe possible in a single
show. 'My Defences are Down,' 'Anything You Can Do,' 'Falling in Love is
Wonderful' and the ultimate show-stopper 'There's No Business Like Show
Business' are all there. The total is 17. Moreover, there is a wonderfully
dynamic Annie in Kim Criswell. Watch the way she sets the tone with 'You
Can't Get a Man with a Gun': in the end, she doesn't.
Yet if you persist in believing that Annie is old hat, try Stephen
Sondheim's Assassins at the Donmar Warehouse. On the face of it, nothing
could be more bizarre than a musical grouping the assassins, would-be and
real, of American Presidents. But it works. The jolliest song of the lot,
'I'm Going to the Lordy', comes from Charles Guiteau, assassin of President
Garfield, as he climbs to the scaffold. Better known assassins are there as
well, and the restyled Donmar near Covent Garden is a very cheerful place.
Music behind you, switch to Travels With My Aunt at Wyndham's. Possibly you
need to have read Graham Greene's novel fully to appreciate it. If you have,
you will love it, though it should stand up even if you have not. The wonder
in Giles Havergal's adaptation is that practically every line comes directly
from Greene's dialogue. The entire cast is played by four men, including
John Wells and Simon Cadell. It is the most pleasantly amusing show in
London.
You can also rise to farce. The old master, Ray Cooney, has bought the
Playhouse Theatre, writes for it, acts in it and directs it as well. His new
piece, It Runs in the Family is also topical - about funding a London
teaching hospital. Never look down on this style of writing or acting.
Cooney himself is a delight.
Still, if you want comedy on a higher plain, there is Noel Cowrd's Hay Fever
at the Albery Theatre. You may think that you know it by heart, and some of
the lines and situations you probably do, but there is always something to
rediscover. In this production there is Maria Aitken as Judith Bliss,
splendid in hats, wellington boots or indeed whatever she wears. Ms Aitken
can be marvellously petulant. The direction by Alan Strachan gives unusual
scope to the unfortunate visitors to the Bliss household: Sara Crowe, who
made her name in Coward's Private Lives a couple of years ago, as the
flapper, and Christopher Godwin as the diplomatist out of his depth.
For sophisticated writing of a more modern kind, try Three Birds Alighting
on a Field by Timberlake Wertenbaker at the Royal Court Theatre. Although
there will be no performances during Christmas week, the play's run has been
extended until January 9. About the price and value of art, and the fashions
in the market, it is one of the wittiest new English plays to have emerged
in the last year or two. It has a splendid opening from the auctioneer's
stand and an outstanding performance by Harriet Walter, the girl from
Benenden who marries a Greek millionaire and finally achieves
self-confidence. Such elegance is not always associated with the Court: you
should see it while it lasts.
In the same vein you should catch Me and My Girl at the Adelphi Theatre, for
after a run of seven years it is coming to an end on January 16. For
innocent enjoyment the show that contains 'The Lambeth Walk' can scarcely be
beaten. The walk is infectious.
There are or course other shows worth seeing. The new Carousel at the
National Theatre is reviewed in today's paper. There is a new Cyrano at the
Haymarket next week as well as a new Hamlet with Kenneth Branagh at the
Barbican. The common thread of those listed above, however, is that you are
almost bound to leave the theatre more cheerful than when you went in. From
some you will come out singing.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts (Christmas Entertainment): Oh yes you can] - Antony
Thorncroft tracks down some pantos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYONE can breath a sigh of relief this Christmas since once again there
is no major West End panto. Recent efforts have been under rehearsed,
woefully scripted vehicles for declining stars. But anyone whose perfect
family Christmas includes Boxing Day at the panto need travel no further
than Richmond, where the usually reliable Derek Griffiths is masterminding
Snow White; or Stratford East, where the laid back atmosphere should ensure
a happy (and politically correct) Aladdin; or Bromley where the Churchill
has the not so politically correct Jimmy Tarbuck as Idle Jack in Dick
Whittington.
But if panto is out of fashion there is no shortage of alternative Christmas
shows. The Shaw is mounting Pinocchio; Paul Nicholas will be tightrope
walking, juggling and trapezing his way through Barnum at the Dominion from
Monday; and the Snow Queen has settled at the Young Vic.
And one old stalwart has been re-vamped in time for Christmas. Unlike
British Rail, Starlight Express (approaching its ninth year at the Victoria
Apollo) has received a complete modernisation. This musical fantasy about a
train set that comes alive at night is, if anything, more baffling than
ever. On one track it offers the latest in hi tech wizardry, as the cast
roller-skate around the theatre like Nintendo graphics. On another it
celebrates old fashioned virtues, steam power over diesel and electric,
modest worth over flash competitiveness. There is even a mystical element
which makes it the ideal Christmas treat.
Producer Trevor Nunn has given it a thorough going over, and composer Andrew
Lloyd Webber has written five new songs. The result is a softer show.
Instead of the threatening Thatcherite Controller guiding the action we have
a little boy's dream come true. Two of the new numbers are romantic ballads,
one of which, 'Next time you fall in love', should become a cabaret
standard.
But while the mood is mellow, the all dancing, all singing, skaters seem
more energised, showing off some very fancy somersaults. The cast, held
together by Lon Satton as the aged steam loco, are still tentative about the
new story line but the special effects are faster, the music so revitalised
that it embraces Sir Andrew's first Rap number, and the audience of children
and foreign tourists remained reverentially delighted.
Since Charles Dickens virtually invented our modern, or rather our
pre-television, Christmas he would be delighted if, as the Ghost of
Christmas Past, he popped into Ron Pember's adaptation of A Christmas Carol
at the Mermaid. This manages to broaden the story slightly to provide some
cheap guffaws for the kids, and to add a sprinkling of musical numbers for
cheery ensemble choruses, while staying honourably true to the original. And
what a fine story it is, perhaps best suited for jaded Thatcherites but with
enough creepy moments and sentimental gushings to keep the whole family
happy.
Douglas Fielding is not quite nasty enough as Scrooge (there is the touch of
a Doctor Who about him) but a matinee audience of school children was
impressively gripped as the company rollocked through Vanessa Ford's
direction.
Of course there is one traditional panto in the heart of London. Whittington
Junior and his Sensational Cat could not be more traditional or more
central. The script is cobbled together from a Victorian original, all
rhyming couplets and cringe making puns, and it is performed at the Players'
Theatre under the arches at Charing Cross, the epicentre of the capital.
This annual Players' panto is a good idea which sometimes scores, sometimes
horribly misses. This year it is a good one. An attractive cast battle
through the good natured nonsense, held together by Amanda Bairstow's
chipper Dick and Nigel Williams monumental Emperor of Morocco. There is
something puritanical about the Players, despite its raison d'etre as the
home of vulgar old music hall, and the dick jokes, essential for an
enjoyable Whittington, are raced over. Ms Bairstow also lets the side down
by wearing shorts rather than long legs.
The music has been down graded to drawing room ballads: I missed the skits
on Verdi, Donizetti and Rossini which in past years have been memorably
sung. But this is still a cheerful, off beat, panto, offering un-demanding
fun.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Arts (Christmas Entertainment): Seasonal celluloid offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RECENT years the Yuletide film release pattern in Britain seems to have
been designed by E. Scrooge. Little for kiddies and not much more for
grown-ups: unless they like oddly-timed horror films like last Christmas's
The People Under The Stairs.
That was all about children being starved and imprisoned under the
floorboards: very seasonal. But this year Home Alone 2 comes to town, an
altogether more children-friendly proposition as young Macauley Culkin
mislays his parents yet again, this time in New York, and fends off the same
pair of wacky burglars (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern).
Sir Richard Attenborough's Chaplin promises us another of his portraits of
small but messianic heroes of the 20th century, to match the director's
earlier Gandhi. America's Robert Downey Jr plays our Charlie with rumoured
panache and a guaranteed British accent. And before Christmas children of
all ages will be able to see The Muppet Christmas Carol, in which Kermit and
Miss Piggy, too long absent from our screens, give Dickens a seasonal
going-over.
For grown-ups there are Kevin Costner's new film The Bodyguard and Tom
Cruise and Jack Nicholson offering power-casting in the ex-Broadway
courtroom drama A Few Good Men. The first I still await; the second woos the
box office with a cunning blend of boy-scout heroics - Cruise as a young
Navy lawyer defending two murder-accused Marines - and pyrotechnic acting
from Nicholson.
None of the other major US Christmas releases, like Coppola's Dracula and
Disney's Aladdin, are set to open in the UK before the New Year. But never
mind. There are still autumn holdovers worth catching. If you were too busy
in recent months watching the real-life dramas all around us, you may now
make up for lost time.
Most festive of all is Beauty And The Beast, Disney's 30th animated feature
and as visually dazzling as any since the first (Snow White). And some
children might enjoy the tinselled absurdism of Strictly Ballroom, a
fleet-footed Australian comedy which my predecessor on this paper, David
Robinson, included in his recent all-time Ten Best Films list for Sight And
Sound.
That is going it a bit. But Orson Welles's Othello, Woody Allen's Husbands
And Wives and Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven, all still viewable, would be
worthy company in any pantheon. Welles turns the moor's tragedy into a
Shakespearean Ivan The Terrible: white-hot compositions and bold, hieratic
performances. Allen's film is a bitter-hilarious picture of self-destruct
relationships. You have to go back to Annie Hall and Manhattan for an Allen
in livelier form. And Unforgiven, a haunting tale of rough justice in the
Old West (where Eastwood himself looks as old and monumental as the
landscapes), is the best Western of recent times.
Less demanding picture-hunters may settle for one of the gimmick-strewn
entertainment machines trundling across the Atlantic. Sneakers, starring
Robert Redford, is a merry tale of computer hackers hacking into the
political big time. And Death Becomes Her has Meryl Streep and Goldie Hawn
being picturesquely attacked by special effects and resembling Henry Moore
sculptures.
As for British film-makers, two have work now on display, though only one of
their films is British. Kenneth Branagh's Peter's Friends trips the bright
fantastic through a Chekhovian script with a cast of young TV comics
(Stephen Fry, Tony Slattery, Hugh Laurie) learning to play straight. And
Ridley Scott's Blade Runner: The Director's Cut shows that you do not have
to be an American to create the definitive vision of urban America in the
next millennium. See, marvel and come out humming the sets.

ballet, music and opera
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
BALLET, alone among the arts, moves into the major key at Christmas. This
month sees the centenary of The Nutcracker. Too bad the UK does not have a
great staging of this (potentially) marvellous ballet. Those who need a fix
of Tchaikovsky's classic score this Christmas may attend English National
Ballet's month of Nutcrackers at the Festival Hall (December 21-January 16)
or Birmingham Royal Ballet's three-week season at the Birmingham Hippodrome
(until December 19). Better than either, however, is Matthew Bourne's impish
and refreshing version for Adventures in Motion Pictures, staged (as in
1892) in a double-bill with Tchaikovsky's Yolanta and presented by Opera
North at the Grand Theatre, Leeds. (18-22 December and 20-30 January).
Frederick Ashton's ballet Tales of Beatrix Potter, newly adapted for the
stage from the 1971 film, is Covent Garden's main Christmas offering this
year, in a double bill with his classic 1964 Shakespearian one-acter, The
Dream. Despite frosty reviews, it is currently delighting not only children
but numerous adults. Only a few Pounds 50 seats remain, but seats upstairs
are the best place to catch the most enchantingly choreographed tale of all
 -the Two Naughty Mice. The three-act Cinderella is yet another Ashton
ballet (1948) that works as seasonal fun and brilliant choreography. The
current staging, though flawed, is basically commendable and often
enthralling (December 23-Febrary 3).
Something in Ashton's spirit had an instinct for Christmas. London City
Ballet, during its four-week season at Sadler's Wells, is presenting his
1937 Victorian-skaters-in-winter masterpiece, Les Patineurs - one of the
most perfect ballets ever made - in a triple bill (December 14-16, 21-23).
Balanchine's brilliant 1960 Donizetti Variations, scarcely known in Europe,
is also to be seen on the December 14-16 bill. Other performances are of Ben
Stevenson's Romeo and Juliet.
The Messiah crops up all over the place at this time of year. For example:
St Mary's, Bryanston Square (Dec 12, Geoffrey Hanson conducting the London
Ripieno Singers); Royal Festival Hall (December 14-15, Franz Welser-Most
conducting the LPO, Felicity Lott and others); Barbican (December 14, Jane
Glover conducting the RPO and Huddersfield Choral Society); Westminster
Central Hall (December 15, organised by soprano Eiddwen Harrhy in aid of the
homeless); St John's, Smith Square (December 16 and 17, by candlelight, John
Lubbock conducting the St John's Orchestra and London Philharmonic Choir);
and many more.
The performances at St John's, Smith Square, performances are part of a
season of Yuletide choral music there (December 13-23). Repertory includes
Mediaeval, Renaissance, Bohemian and Polish; also Britten's St Nicholas
(December 15). A highlight should be The Sixteen's performance, over two
nights, of Bach's Christmas Oratorio (Parts 1-3, Tuesday 22; Parts 4-6,
December 23).
The most obviously Christmas opera this year is Hansel and Gretel, although
one may pause before bringing the kids along to David Pountney's masterful
and provocative staging. Few critics have kind words for Ken Russell's
version of Princess Ida (also Coliseum, until January 21); as with last
year's seasonal staging of Fledermaus, you go to it for the sake of either
argument or mindless frivolity. In contrast, running from December 16 until
January 23, is Pountney's new staging of Janacek's The Adventures of Mr
Broucek. Hopes are high for Covent Garden's new production of Handel's
Alcina (December 22-29, January 15-22), particularly on vocal grounds; the
cast includes Yvonne Kenny, Ann Murray, Kathleen Kuhlmann and Anthony Rolfe
Johnson.

SINCE LAST year's annual report on the state of the mass wine market, a
tidal wave of cheap South African varietals has washed over the shelves of
our supermarkets and off-licence chains. They are all Pounds 2.99, white
(only 15 per cent of Cape wine is red) and competently made. Colombar(d),
the armagnac grape that brought us Vin de Pays des Cotes de Gascogne, is
usually the liveliest of the range, perhaps because of its high natural
acidity.
We have also been swamped by own-labels from the rest of the winemaking
southern hemisphere - most using some combination of the words Creek, Gully
and Brook, often with a bird's or Aboriginal name, and an awful lot from
Penfolds, the Australian company now involved with Santa Rita of Chile.
Chilean wine is getting better; Montes makes dependably sophisticated reds.
Australia continues to dominate the wine glasses of the middle classes and
the main development this year has been the rash of delicious whites, mostly
at either Pounds 2.99 or Pounds 3.99, made covertly from Riesling but
presented so as to disguise the fact. So the grape that is arguably the
world's greatest has to put on an overcoat marked dry white Semillon before
it is allowed to saunter into the crowd. I am putting my money into white
burgundy bottles, used increasingly to make non-Chardonnays look more
Chardonnaylike.
Not content with filching the still wine market, the Australians have been
making significant inroads with their inexpensive fizz. Yalumba, Angas,
Seppelt and Green Point all have their devotees.
Elsewhere, Eastern Europe is a treasure trove of bargains, and Iberia keeps
surprising us at the bottom end, with the likes of red Leziria from the
Alentejo and La Mancha white. There are some horribly over-oakchipped blends
about.
The real bargains of this Christmas are the better quality sherries, often
sold in half bottles, all at absurdly low prices for such historic wines.
Here is the first half of my alphabetical end-of-term report on the major
supermarkets and chains, with dry whites followed by reds, sweet whites,
fizz and fortified wines with star ratings for effort.
Asda*
A great deal of effort has been expended by the buying team here, but not
always to brilliant effect.
Danie de Wet Rhine Riesling 1991, Pounds 3.99. Well-balanced South African
attempt at an Auslese, although if the Germans can't sell them . . .
Asda Leon 1986, Pounds 2.99. Good concentration of colour, fruit and
American oak. Lively Spanish red.
Tokaji Aszu 1981 3 puttonyos, Pounds 6.99, 50cl. Very special sweet wine,
fiery and exciting tawny with a sabre slice of acidity. Knocks spots off all
these modern varietals Hungary now sends us.
Augustus Barnett**
There is now evidence of real enthusiasm among the buyers for the Bass
retail chain. An especially good choice in the Pounds 2.99 to Pounds 3.99
range.
Cortese del Piemonte 1991, Pounds 2.99. Much smarter package and flavour
(pears) in this dry white Italian than the price suggests.
Vina Alaiz Blanco 1991, Pounds 2.99. Fruity dry white from Navarre.
Viognier 1991 Pere Anselme, Pounds 4.49. One of the better Languedoc answers
to Condrieu. Full-bodied yet crisp.
Gewurztraminer Spatlese Friedelsheimer Kreuz 1991, Pounds 4.99. Very trendy
off dry German, complete with splodgy label. Their enterprise in finding
this, and his red Cabernet, deserves the reward of sales.
Castillo de Montoro 1990, Pounds 2.89. Good oaky Spanish red, infinitely
more concentration and fruit than the ubiquitous and pallid Don Darias.
Ch La Montade Bergerac 1990, Pounds 3.79. Well-balanced, utterly respectable
claret, even if made slightly outside the usual area.
Ch Troncin-Capdevila 1990, Pounds 3.49. Elegant red. More evidence of the
usefulness of Cabardes.
Ch Ormieres Minervois 1990, Pounds 3.49. Lovely expression of Minervois
suavity from top property Ch Fabas.
La Cetto Petite Sirah 1988, Pounds 3.99. Powerful, full-blooded, long, well
balanced, and Mexican. Another example of the wine world's elastic
frontiers.
Majestic***
Some good and interesting new Italians at this warehouse chain and some
exclusive offerings.
Mauzac 1990 Delmas, Pounds 3.99. A high proportion of the Chardonnay grown
in the Blanquette de Limoux area is made into still wine. Here is a
well-made, still version of the main Blanquette grape which is admirably
ripe yet given bite by its its characteristic appleskin finish.
Domaine Foulatiere 1991 Coteaux du Languedoc, Pounds 3.59. Excellent depth
in this minimally-labelled Syrah-rich southern French red.
Montepulciano d'Abruzzo, Colli del Moro 1990, Pounds 4.99. Distinctly
superior barrique-aged Montepulciano. Drink now.
Ch Meaume 1989, Pounds 4.99. Englishman's claret and one of the best
vintages to date. Useful superior house red for the Christmas season.
San Crispino Sangiovese di Romagna 1988, Pounds 5.99. Distinctly superior,
concentrated Sangiovese that has picked up some dried grape flavour from the
previous lodger in the French oak barrels in which it spent a couple of
years.
Montes Alpha 1988, Pounds 7.99. Chilean answer to classed-growth bordeaux -
which managed to wrest a silver medal in the Bordeaux lion's den at Vinexpo
last year. Decant and amaze.
Reserve du General 1989, Pounds 12.95. Ch Palmer's second wine from a
forward vintage. Great manners.
Ch de Rolland 1990 Barsac, Pounds 7.69 a half. Serious sauternes from an
ultra-ripe vintage. To be drunk now or in five years.
Shadow Creek 1983, Pounds 5.99. A parcel of well-aged California fizz, an
offcut from Domaine Chandon which has gained admirably toasty character from
its, presumably, unforeseen, bottle age. A seriously good buy, but a one
off.
Gateway*
Good for very cheap bottles.
Leziria, Pounds 1.99. Gateway has the best price (a promotional one) on this
juicy Portuguese red.
Chevalier Blanc de Blancs, Pounds 1.99. Creditably fruity dry white made
from Spanish La Mancha fruit and bottled on a line more used to the local
Rose d'Anjou. The EC at work.
Marks &amp; Spencer**
Range is more conservative than ever nowadays, although there are some
bright spots, notably on white burgundies.
Cocoparra Sauvignon Blanc 1992, Pounds 3.49. From Australia's irrigated
interior, a fresh, lively white from which every ounce of Sauvignon flavour
has been extracted.
Jeunes Vignes, Pounds 4.49. A paler shade of Chablis. Light but very true.
Macon Villages, 1991. Pounds 4.99. Perfectly respectable, lively southern
white burgundy from Antonin Rodet.
Chablis 1990, Pounds 6.99. M&amp;S has been dealing with the Chablisienne co-op
for so long that it gets some of the best vats.
Ch Le Mounan 1990, Pounds 3.99. Even the M &amp; S wine buyer is startled by how
good this claret tastes at the moment. Concentrated and lively.
Rasteau 1990 Cote-du-Rhone Villages. Pounds 4.99. Absolutely fabulous, this
offering from the dynamic Chapoutier brothers. I would happily pay Pounds 2
more a bottle for such traditionally made, low yield concentration. It
should ideally be drunk from 1994 but is already enjoyable if you appreciate
sincerity.
Bourgogne Epineuil 1989, Pounds 5.49. Light, true red burgundy from the far
northern vineyards around Chablis. Good with white meat.
Moscatel de Valencia 1991, Pounds 3.79. Much lighter and crisper than the
cheaper, Sainsbury's version. Still good value.
M &amp; S Champagne, Pounds 9.99 One of the better cheap champagnes around.
Oddbins****
The wine lover's favourite chain has refurbished its old Farringdon Street
branch in London EC1 as a 'fane wane' store, except that Oddbins' definition
of fine wine is predictably unpredictable. Current extra-special bargain
areas include crus classes 1990 red bordeaux available by the bottle,
vintage port at laughable prices, specially bottled vintage malt whiskies
and some giveaway young burgundies from Jaffelin, recently sold by Drouhin
to Boisset. We won't see Corton Charlemagne at Pounds 19.99 again.
Eden Ridge Dry White 1992, Pounds 3.99. Organic, lively Australian made
mainly from Riesling, with some Sauvignon aroma and an interesting
hotchpotch of old vine varieties. Buy now before the price rises.
Cosme Palacio Blanco 1990, Pounds 4.69. Golden, oaky, full-bodied,
traditionally styled white rioja with a French accent.
Leasingham Domaine Clare Chardonnay 1991, Pounds 4.99. Lively, subtle, lots
of unAustralian characteristics except that it is still a bargain.
De Bortoli Yarra Chardonnay 1991, Pounds 6.99. Made by exuberant winemakers
from restrained, cool climate fruit, An impressive combination.
Haardter Herrenletten Riesling Spatlese 1990 Muller-Catoir, Pounds 7.99.
More silly prices from one of Germany's geniuses. Both fruit and place
explode from this particular bottle of medium dry white but no Muller-Catoir
should disappoint and the Halbtrockens are great with food.
The Monterey Vineyard Pinot Noir, Pounds 2.99. For bargain hunters rather
than connoisseurs, this is California at eastern European prices. Earthy or
dirty, depending on your taste, but that's Pinot for you.
Baileys Shiraz 1990, Pounds 4.99. Same old toyshop label and still rich and
concentrated, but softer and more Italianate (Dolcetto-like?) than of old.
Good value.
Le Paysan, Pounds 5.49. Nothing at all peasantlike about this alternative to
mature cru bourgeois claret from the Cotes du Frontonnais near Toulouse
which, Oddbins ambitiously claims on the label, 'is about as fashionable as
flared trousers'.
Vino da Tavola] Pounds 6.99. Very Supertuscan wine, very Steadman label,
very Oddbins price.
Wirra Wirra The Angelus 1990, Pounds 7.49. Ultra suave claret from South
Australia.
Jaffelin 1990 red and 1991 white burgundies. The Monthelie 1990 at Pounds
9.49 is probably the best buy. Ambitiously fruity red burgundy built for the
long term. For drinking, preferably with something more powerful than a
turkey, or keeping. The Chambolle-Musigny 1990, Pounds 13.99, oddly, is
probably readier. And the white Chassagne-Montrachet, Vergers 1991, Pounds
11.99, would add glamour to any table this Christmas.
1990 bordeaux, red and sweet white. These bottles have to be ordered but
should take no more than a week to reach your local branch. Take advantage
of the fact that you can buy by the single bottle rather than committing
yourself to a dozen bottles. Good buys include the alluring Beau-Site Pounds
6.99, silky La Tour de Mons Pounds 8.99, oaky Poujeaux Pounds 8.99,
precocious Lafon-Rochet Pounds 9.49, plump Ormes de Pez Pounds 9.99, bargain
Leoville-Barton Pounds 13.49, gorgeous Pichon-Baron Pounds 19.49 and
hedonistic Conseillante at Pounds 29.99.
These reds are designed to be kept but are still at the beguiling baby stage
so could easily be served this Christmas. Ditto the delicious 1990
sauternes: Maynes des Carmes Pounds 5.99 a half and, well worth the extra,
de Malle Pounds 7.99 a half.
Vintage port Quinta do Noval 1982, Pounds 9.99. Graham 1983 Pounds 13.99,
Warre 1980 Pounds 14.99. A clutch of bargain ports to drink.
NEXT WEEK: Safeway, Sainsbury's, Tesco, Thresher/Wine Rack/Bottoms Up,
Victoria Wine and Waitrose.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Food: Take some festive tips from the chefs - Six of the
best tell Nicholas Lander the culinary secrets they have discovered in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARIOUS epithets have been heaped on professional chefs over the past few
years but one of their most endearing qualities usually is ignored: as
inspiring teachers to other chefs, interested amateurs and inquisitive
customers.
Chefs learn from each other either at the table (they are, invariably, the
first customers in any newly-opened restaurant), over a late-night beer or,
increasingly, from travel abroad. Here, in time for the festive season, five
of Britain's top restaurant chefs and one television chef pass on some of
the culinary secrets they have learnt during 1992.
FRANCO TARUSCHIO, chef/proprietor of the Walnut Tree Inn, Llandewi Skirrid,
NP7 8AW, Wales. Tel: 0873-852-797.
Lounging half-awake on a beach on the Marche Adriatic this summer, I
overheard a group of women nearby. They had obviously come from different
parts of Italy and were discussing meals they had enjoyed during their
holiday.
I picked up first of all lasagne di Melanzane, using aubergines instead of
pasta. Slices of aubergine are cooked on a griddle and layered with meat
ragu, bechamel sauce and parmesan before being baked.
Then they moved on to pasticcio of polenta, layers of polenta layered with a
sauce made from onions and milk. Fry finely-chopped onion gently in butter
until golden. Season with salt, freshly-ground black pepper and a pinch of
nutmeg. Add the milk and cook over a low heat for 30 minutes.
Place a thin layer of polenta in a gratin dish, then the onion sauce, then a
layer of ricotta. Carry on layering, finishing with the onion sauce and a
generous sprinkling of parmesan. Bake until the top is golden.
This dish - which I now offer vegetarians - was described by a lady fom the
Valtellina area of Italy and was a revelation to me. We Italians tend to be
very regional with our recipes.
The third recipe was for aubergines in carrozza. Bake a 'sandwich' of two
slices of aubergine, cooked on the griddle, filled with a slice of
mozzarella and either a sliver or two of sun-dried tomatoes and a sprinkling
of oregano or an anchovy and oregano.
Dip the 'sandwiches' in egg and breadcrumbs and deep fry. This is a modern
version of mozzarella in carrozza, replacing the bread with aubergines.
Without the anchovies it is another dish for vegetarians - simple but
delicious.
There might have been more recipes to be overheard. Unfortunately, I fell
asleep.
SALLY CLARKE, chef/proprietor of Clarke's, 124 Kensington Church Street,
London W8 4BH. Tel: 071-221-9225.
I began grilling food professionally 15 years ago in California. Now, this
style of cooking in my restaurant attracts kitchen staff from some of the
best restaurants in England. Yet, whatever their qualifications, their first
day always begins with a discourse on grilling:
1. Get rid of all the debris on the grill with a stiff wire brush, making
sure the bars are nice and smooth. Do not rub the bars with oil.
2. Light the grill well before required.
3. Run your hand 6-9 inches above the grill to discover the hot and warm
spots,
4. Make sure the foods are of an even individual thickness. Meat generally
is easier to grill if trimmed of bone and excess fat.
5. Damp or wet foods - big white fish such as cod or halibut - will stick.
Use kitchen paper to remove excess water.
6. Foods lacking in natural oils - venison, fillet steak and some vegetables
 -must be marinated in a little oil a few seconds before grilling.
Marinating oily fish such as red mullet or sardines will be disastrous.
7. Turn the food on the grill as little as possible. Unnecessary turning
makes the food look messy.
Then, there is the final factor: how to hold the tongs correctly. Gently,
not too firmly, and with a lot of tender, loving care.
SHAUN HILL, chef, Gidleigh Park, Chagford Devon TQ13 8HH. Tel: 0647-432-367;
fax 0647-432-574.
The assimilation of ideas and techniques from other cooks and restaurants is
permanent and ongoing, something almost sub-conscious. That is how we keep
our minds fresh. After all, most cooks work with basically the same raw
materials. Certain combinations of flavour and texture appeal, others do
not.
A personal example is this. I have for years worked on a pasta dish
flavoured with chicken livers, lemon, garlic and cheese. The combination can
work perfectly, producing something which is balanced and neither too
cloying nor too sharp. But getting the right balance can be difficult. Too
much lemon, for instance, and the livers taste sour.
At a meal at L'Amphycles in Paris (tel: 40.68.01.01), I was served a
scallops' starter topped with deep-fried lemon zest. Deep-fried zest sounds
an absurd garnish, a needless frippery that gives haute cuisine a bad name.
In fact, it was sensational.
The technique was drafted instantly into my own pasta dish. It was improved
dramatically when, eventually, I worked out that the stuff needs to macerate
in lemon juice for a few hours before frying.
(Actually, when I say 'my' pasta dish, I should mention that the original
idea came from an Elizabeth David recipe which also called for Parma ham.
She evidently collected it from an Italian girl called Giovanna in a remote
Tuscan village. Who knows where Giovanna got it from?)
KEN HOM, writer and television cookery presenter.
I have spent most of the past year directing my version of East-West cuisine
in some of the best hotel restaurants around the world. What I have learnt
ranges from how to deal with the sublime lemon grass to the more mundane
potato.
First, from fellow chefs in Thailand, how best to extract the flavours of
lemon grass, a herb that imparts to Thai and Vietnamese dishes a compelling,
balm-like flavour. The trick is to crush the stalks and allow them to remain
in the simmering broth or sauce for at least one hour. The stalks may not be
edible but they are storehouses of flavour and fragrance.
From Serge Danserau, executive chef of the Regent in Sydney, I learnt a new
technique for preparing lamb loin fillets, a favourite main course that
works as well at home as in an hotel. His trick is to cook them in the oven
at a very low temperature for three hours. Before serving, the loin is
re-heated quickly, sliced, and served piping hot.
With the lamb, a new potato recipe from Anthony Marshall at the Langham
Hilton, London. Steam or bake jacket potatoes. Slice them and then, with a
two-inch round cutter, press out pieces which you saute to golden brown in
goose fat, oil or clarified butter. Season as you saute and, finally, drain
them on kitchen paper to remove any excess fat.
DAVID WILSON, chef/proprietor, Peat Inn, Cupar, Fife, Scotland KY15. Tel:
033-484-206; fax 033-484-530.
What I have been trying to achieve in my cooking is lightness and natural
flavours. The primary advantage is that the food tastes as it should, but it
also ensures that my customers enjoy healthier eating. Saucing has become
much lighter, and this can actually simplify things for the home cook
provided they know what they are doing.
In fish, shellfish or vegetable cooking, try using a sauce made with good
virgin olive oil, cut perhaps with a flavoured vinegar and/or fresh herbs.
This should be served warm. Never boil the sauce.
Meat or game dishes, particularly slow-cooked stews or casseroles, should
have a sauce made with nothing but stock (from the bones). Thickening can be
done by liquidising a tablespoon or so of the vegetables cooked with the
dish. There is no need to use flour or butter.
Desserts can also benefit from this. A sauce made with fruit juices -
grapefruit, orange, passion fruit or a combination, perhaps with some
finely-diced fruits through it - not only tastes wonderful but is so much
lighter and healthier than creams or custards.
PIERRE KOFFMANN, chef/proprietor, La Tante Claire, 68-9 Royal Hospital Road,
London SW3 4HP. Tel: 071-352-6045.
By nature I am conservative and, therefore, against new methods of cooking
or preparing food because I feel it goes against my craftmanship. In 1963,
when I was 15, I enrolled at Le college d'enseignement technique Reffye, a
catering college in Tarbes in the south-west of France, close to where I was
born. For the past 30 years, I have been refining what I learnt there.
Therefore, I prefer tradition to adventure.
The only novel way I cook fish is salmon fillets in goose fat. Heat the fat
(enough to cover the fish) in a deep saucepan to 50`C (no hotter or the
salmon will dry out). Cook the fillets in the fat for 7-10 minutes
(depending on their thickness). The salmon is ready when you can pierce it
with a needle without any resistance.
But when I say that this method is novel, I must add that I got it from my
grandmother, who made the goose fat herself on her farm in Gascony, and used
salmon caught in the river nearby.

WELL, here we are, with less than two weeks to Christmas and you still
haven't found anything for she who is nearest and dearest. Do not despair.
So dire has the retail scene been this year that several of the most
seductive small shops have reduced prices enormously. So, for those still
looking, try these suggestions.
Oliver Sweeney's carpet slippers, strictly for lounge lizards, come in
wonderful fabrics: dark black ottoman, black or cream background florals, or
a brocade with an oval motif. Made-to-measure, they usually take four weeks;
but at 4th Floor Hairdressers, 4 Northington Street, London WC1 (tel:
071-405-6011), there are several pairs at Pounds 125.
Lucienne Phillips, a retailer of legendary chic, has declared an
unprecedented sale at her shop at 89 Knightsbridge, London SW1. Almost
everything is reduced by between 50-75 per cent including much of Jean
Muir's Studio Collection, which is half-price. This means that a wool crepe
short-sleeved dress and jacket in a gorgeous array of colours now sells for
Pounds 220 instead of Pounds 550.
There are lots of Arabella Pollen's snappy jackets and pieces by designers
such as Victor Edelstein, Tomasz Starzewski and Amanda Wakely as well as
Harriet Anstruthers' beautiful, big, square silk scarves; Suzanne Katkhuda's
ceramic jewellery; and some very glitzy little bags by Stephanie Wood.
Anything from Browns of 23-27 South Molton Street, London SW1, has cachet.
At the cheaper end, there are Pierre Mantoux cotton tights in gorgeous
colours at Pounds 15 a pair; Browns' own simple, crisp, white cotton shirts
at Pounds 20; and jewellery from names such as Sonia Rykiel and Eric Beamon,
which starts at Pounds 30.
Higher up the price bracket is a Donna Karan pure cotton body at Pounds 50.
For Pounds 90, there are Gigli ruffled shirts in white, soft sage green and
deep plums, while for Pounds 225 you could get a pair of Browns' own leather
jeans.
Fenwick of Bond Street is always a wonderful source of inexpensive but bang
up-to-the-minute accessories. Look out for leopard print scarves at Pounds
39.95; for hot pink, red or royal blue suede gloves at Pounds 14.95 a pair;
or for a Moschino bag at Pounds 39.95.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Fashion: The subtle variations in the black-tie uniform / A
look at the choices of kit available for formal events, and explains why
gentlemen should always knot their own bow ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELIZABETH WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVENING wear for men looks deceptively simple. The usual kit seems
well-defined, with ground rules honed by tradition. In reality, it is easy
to get it wrong.
The black tie is a relatively new tradition. It was first worn by Edward VII
when he was Prince of Wales and became popular in the US around 1910 when
the Tuxedo Club was started in upstate New York. Between then and now, posh
parties have seen everything from the Sergeant Pepper velvet patchwork of
the 1960s to serious black silk polo-neck sweaters sported by 1980s'
advertising men with their Japanese designer suits.
These days when the invitation says 'Black Tie,' it means exactly that.
White tie (and tails) are commanded rarely these days, except for livery
dinners, hunt and Highland balls. Cocktail parties and smarter dinners are
the occasions when you can afford to be more adventurous.
When choosing a dinner jacket the quality of the fabric is important and
generally you get what you pay for. Suits are best tailored from barathea (a
combination of wool and silk); silk alone is too shiny and you could look
like a second-hand car salesman. Revers (lapels) on the jacket and the
discreet strip down the outside of the trouser leg are best when cut from
fine corded silk.
Jackets can either be single or double-breasted depending on your taste and
figure. Traditionally they should be without vents and are a little shorter
than those worn every day. Collars are best cut with classic revers and not
with the sort of shawl or roll collar favoured by Glen Miller.
Trousers are lightly pleated, high-waisted and always worn with braces.
Cummerbunds are purely decorative and should be looped through a tab at the
back of the trousers so that the two do not come adrift.
They were originally designed with a small pocket hidden in the pleats to
house a fob watch or some snuff when waistcoats went out of fashion. I
prefer cummerbunds and ties to be in black corded silk and would only choose
purple or emerald for whacky braces or satin linings.
Nearly half of Moss Bros customers are brave enough to buy bow ties that
they tie themselves; an adjustable tie could be tied for you in the shop but
these cannot be worn with a wing-collared shirt. A good standard width for a
tie is 2 1/2 inches although Turnbull &amp; Asser, with many American customers,
stand by a good three inches. Avoid made-up ties - they always look like
propellers.
Shirts are classier in a pure fibre, either silk or cotton, in white or
cream. Once again simple is best; forget frills, the front could either be
pleated or made out of marcella (a stiffish honeycomb cotton). Wing collars
must be detachable as they cannot be starched successfully if they are not,
but a plain collar is perfectly alright. Pocket handkerchiefs are perfect in
white cotton.
Shoes can be surprisingly flashy - black patent with a flat gross-grain bow
on the front can look good but if these are too foppish for you a plain
black leather lace-up will look just as good. Velvet slippers are very chic,
with or without monograms, but are best with a velvet smoking-jacket.
If it isn't a 'black-tie' do what do you wear? Much will depend on your
personality and what sort of 'do' you expect it to be. For a dinner after a
day out shooting in the country velvet smoking jackets (with black evening
trousers and velvet slippers) are generally worn; these are usually
double-breasted with frogging and the most popular colour is a dark forest
green.
If this look is too fogeyish for you there are many alternatives. A young
friend wore his dinner jacket and bow tie with a pair of studded black
leather trousers to a trendy Paris party; it looked perfect.
If you do not attend many formal evenings it is a good idea to buy a plain
black lightweight wool suit to wear with a white silk shirt and black bow
tie, or with an exciting silk waistcoat.
Many younger designers are making classically cut single-breasted velvet
suits which look very lush for London nights out. Richard James of 37a
Savile Row, London W1, for example, has wonderful velvet jackets for Pounds
295, and matching trousers for Pounds 125. Frilly shirts are fun but should
be worn without a tie and if you choose a brightly printed silk bow it is
best not to team it with a matching cummerbund or waistcoat - too much fun
all at once looks a bit frenetic.
Waistcoats which are not part of three-piece suits have made a comeback.
They are often works of art and, if the fabric on the back is the same as
the front, need not be hidden under a jacket.
With black tie, cuff links, dress studs and watches are the only acceptable
jewellery. Antique gold oval cuff links are my favourite but they are rather
expensive. However, there are lots of cheaper alternatives. Most shops sell
coloured silk-knot cuff links and gold plate has become so sophisticated it
is difficult to tell the difference from 18 carat.
WHERE TO SHOP:
Moss Bros, 27 King Street, WC2 (and 90 branches nationwide) has 1,000 dress
suits to fit everyone from giants to jockeys. As it also sells a large
number of designer evening suits off-the-peg it could be a useful place to
choose what style and shape is best for you. Keep away from its own-make
jacket at only Pounds 79. Those who can raise the Pounds 1,295, its most
expensive suit (by Brioni, one of the best Italian ready-to-wear tailors)
will get a very made-to-measure look for their money.
There is a lot to choose from in between. Look out for Jasper Conran, Zegna,
Canali, Hugo Boss, and, for the more generous or 'mature' figure, Chester
Barrie (which sells all over the country as well as from its own shop in
Savile Row).
Moss Bros also stocks a good range of shirts, including my favourite
Pancaldi in cream silk at Pounds 249.
Harrods and Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge both stock good selections of
evening wear. Harrods has a good velvet smoking jacket in several colours
for Pounds 195, a large selection of evening shirts including a cotton one
of its own make. It looks classic when worn under a jacket but has a Rupert
Bear print on the back.
Harvey Nichols stocks the best classic makes as well as Montana (a slightly
sharper cut), Valentino, Adolfo Dominguez and Armani. Emporio Armani has a
younger and cheaper range and has shops on Knightsbridge and in Long Acre,
Covent Garden where a dinner jacket will cost about Pounds 450. Cerruti, who
dressed Anthony Hopkins and Jeremy Irons for the Oscar awards, has an
elegant line; its own shop is at 75 New Bond Street. English Eccentrics
designs a good range of silk waistcoats.
Austin Reed, 103 Regent Street, although better known for business suits
also sells tailored evening wear or it will hire out the complete kit,
including shirt and tie. It would cost Pounds 33.40 to rent a
single-breasted version for the weekend, and an extra Pounds 5 for double.
Austin Reed has a good selection of Chester Barrie, Hugo Boss and Oscar
Jacobson and my eye was caught by some jolly tartan wool waistcoats priced
at Pounds 59.
At the cheaper end Debenhams in Oxford Street (and lots of branches
nationwide) has its own make, IQ, and sells a DJ with satin lapels for
Pounds 130. Turnbull &amp; Asser at 70a Jermyn Street, London SW1 sells superb
velvet smoking jackets at about Pounds 650 and Tuxedo suits for Pounds 900,
both off-the-peg; there are ten different varieties of dress shirts to
choose from and one of the best is in thick, cream tussore silk with French
cuffs at Pounds 175.
New &amp; Lingwood at 53, Jermyn Street has black patent pumps for Pounds 95 and
Oxfords for Pounds 145, but across the road my favourite shoe shop,
Trickers, sells similar classics for a little less. It also has an unusual
black patent loafer with a silk tassel at Pounds 87.70 and will make
tapestry slippers.
For interesting waistcoats, jackets and shirts try Favourbrook, 19-21
Piccadilly Arcade. There are waistcoats in every fabric from rich brocade to
moire silk and to suit everybody from 90-year-olds to Royal pages. No more
than four are made from the same design. Prices range from Pounds 70 to
Pounds 350 for the most unusual one: appliqued with pheasant feathers.
The original waistcoat king is Tom Gilbey, its Waistcoat Gallery is off
Regent Street at 2 New Burlington Place, London W1. It boasts a selection of
1,001 different styles and fabrics and also sells through Liberty, Harrods
and Harvey Nichols. A rather special one in paisley sari silk will cost
Pounds 175.
Smart second-hand clothes were made acceptable by Hackett, 137 Sloane
Street, London SW1, 117 Harewood Road, SW6 and other branches.
It now sells only new versions of the classic cut and all styles are Pounds
395 and good value.
Bertie Wooster, 284 Fulham Road, SW10 has taken on where Hackett left off.
Second hand DJs are Pounds 95 but the quality varies, so you will need to
check what you buy. The owner, George Cazenove, found a beautiful velvet
smoking jacket which had originally cost Pounds 2,800 from Huntsman - He
saved it for himself.
Finally, if you are wondering what to give a special chap this Christmas, a
black cashmere top-coat would be splendid - it could be worn as easily with
less formal suits as with evening wear. Aquascutum of 100 Regent Street, has
the most exotic at Pounds 1,220 but Selfridges of Oxford Street, London W1
has a classic double-breasted version for Pounds 499 and a wool / cashmere
mix for Pounds 225. At Malcolm Levene, 13-15 Chiltern Street, London W1
there is a double-breasted wool / cashmere mix coat at Pounds 328

FT  12 DEC 92 / How To Spend It: Bargains you can picture - Lucia van der
Post puts you in the right frame of mind for Christmas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS YEAR, as if you needed telling, has been grim for almost everyone and
that has been strongly reflected in the art world.
Some of Britain's most famous dealers have shut up shop, others are
struggling to stay afloat by offering some of the best bargains seem for
many a long year.
As scarcely anything can be nicer than a picture for Christmas here are just
a few places where you could find something appealing for the walls without
spending a fortune:
The Art Collection of 3-5 Elystan Street, London SW3, has always made a
point of selling affordable, accessible original drawings and paintings,
almost exclusively representational. But, this year, it is making a point of
having a range of work that sells for less than Pounds 200. As the pictures
are nicely framed they make a complete and ready present.
Roy Miles, possibly most well-known for popularising Russian Art, this year
has 'Art from China' - a wide choice of framed oils at Pounds 300 each at
his gallery at 29 Bruton Street, London W1.
Photographed centre is 'Young Shepherd', a typical example of contemporary
Chinese Folk Art, a mixed media on paper measuring 23in by 232in. There are
also lots of ceramic pots from China ranging in price from Pounds 30 to
Pounds 900.
Burlington Paintings, at 12 Burlington Gardens, London W1, has a collection
of watercolours by the Norfolk artist, Philip Gardner.
Working in watercolour and reed pen there are serene East Anglian
landscapes, portraits (such as the delightful one of Yvette photographed
here left, Pounds 925) and London scenes. Prices start at Pounds 250.
La Galerie, at 225 Ebury Street, London SW1, goes in for very decorative
French work but, this Christmas, has watercolours, pastels and drawings at
prices that start from as little as Pounds 50.
Not strictly art, but of great decorative value nonetheless, is the fine
porcelain sold by Zelli's of 30a Dover Street, London W1. All the porcelain
is hand-made, hand-pierced and hand-painted and almost all of it comes from
Germany.
At Zelli's there are pieces of purely decorative value (such as Paul
Scheurich's drummer boy or the immensely popular Dresden cockatoos) but more
appealing are the pieces with a functional use - intricately decorated
candlesticks by Meissen at Pounds 185 the pair, vases by Nymphenburg from
Pounds 90, white and gold bowls from KPM Berlin Pounds 82, a Dresden pierced
pot-pourri at Pounds 125.
Almost in the collector's class are the beautiful porcelain dolls being sold
by Barclay &amp; Bodie of 7 Blenheim Terrace, London NW8.
All are delightful, all beautifully dressed to fit the part - choose from
sailor girl (Pounds 36), skater (Pounds 55), Alice in Wonderland (Pounds 34)
and Lily (photographed here below, Pounds 35). Each comes in a nice
old-fashioned cardboard box and can be posted for Pounds 4.50 post and
packing.
Do not forget the museums as useful sources of some surprisingly inexpensive
presents - the Horniman Museum, for instance, at London Road, forest Hill,
London SE23 has hand-carved wooden puppets from Burma at Pounds 14.95, Ikat
shawls from Tibet (Pounds 22.95) and candlesticks from Mexico (Pounds
19.95).
Birmingham Museum &amp; Art Gallery, Chamberlain Square, Birmingham, has a
Dinostore where all manner of dinosaur goodies can be bought from bendy
dinosaur rulers at Pounds 1.99 to walking dinosaur wind-ups at Pounds 1.99.
At The Bodleian Library, Oxford, there is lots of lovely stationery but, for
a serious present, there is always The Bodleian Chair, a reproduction of a
1766 library chair in English ash and elm which comes in kit form for Pounds
295.
Finally, at Charleston Farmhouse, near Firle, Lewes, Sussex, there are
hand-made and hand-decorated replicas of original vases, jugs, mugs and fish
bowls by Quentin Bell and Duncan Grant starting at Pounds 9.50.
There are also hand-painted lampshades, each one different, by Robert
Campling and Quentin Bell (prices start at Pounds 42).
Candlewick Green of 35 Neal Street, Covent Garden, London WC2, sells a wide
range of candles and candleholders so anybody still looking for decorative
devices for walls, tables, trees should make a point of looking in on
Candlewick Green.
In particular there is a wide and appealing range of wrought iron
candleholders, all designed by Candlewick Green and made exclusively for it.
A single wall sconce would sell at Pounds 25, while the four-branch table
candle-holder photographed above is Pounds 95 and an elaborate 16-branch
chandelier of considerable elegance is Pounds 395.
Beside the usual range of hand-dipped and moulded candles Candlewick Green
also does wonderful candles for special occasions - orange-shaped for
hallowe'en, floating ones, pillar-shaped, square, cone-shaped and a whole
series suitable for out of doors.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Fashion heralds have designs on the past: Avril Groom flags
the look which has its roots in medieval times
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN Siena, at the frenetic horse-racing pageant of the Palio, heraldic
banners are hoisted which could be forgiven for being mistaken for a display
of Gianni Versace's scarves.
At the Hermes workshops in Paris, their designs on silk incorporate heraldic
symbols including those once British stalwarts the rose, the thistle and the
leek.
And everyone with designs on selling to the yachting fraternity, from Louis
Vuitton to Polo Ralph Lauren, has attempted to translate the heraldry of
nautical flags, usually accompanied by coiled rope and compasses, into
print.
The interplay between heraldry and design is one of Britain's most enduring
images. Originally, of course, it was hardly fashion but a necessity as the
medieval knight rode into battle wearing his identifying colours.
Today's designs, pioneered by Hermes, have seen the braid and badges of
military pomp and circumstance and gold Baroque swirls added.
To the heraldry-wearers of today - from lager louts in Union flag shorts to
the ladies-who-lunch in silk shirts emblazoned with ersatz coats-of-arms -
one would hardly impute noble motives.
In fashion terms, status heraldry wins hands down, despite the best efforts
of avant-garde designers to turn the Union flag into serious design.
Those Baroque designs with their swags and tassels of golden rope or chains
and their shields and badges in rich, opulent colours have what is popularly
recognised as elegance, even when they are inexpensive versions inspired by
great designer names.
As such, they make ideal Christmas presents because, apart from a few
dedicated fans of modernist, minimalist black, it is hard to find anyone who
dislikes them. Heraldic is also one of the few print styles that both sexes
can wear with equanimity.
The original, and probably still the best canvas for such prints is the
shirt, as it shows off the whole design, usually spread unrepeated over a
area to its best advantage.
Hermes was the original past-master of such designs, explaining their appeal
by the 'rich regal palette of colours associated with ceremonial pageantry,
majesty and pomp which, in turn, relates to tradition and ancestry' - all
factors with an emotional pull in today's uncertain modern world.
This perhaps explains the rise of the heraldic silk shirt as high fashion in
the headlong consumerist 1980s and its now becoming a classic for more
traditional dressers in the depressed 1990s.
But the Hermes print did not rule unchallenged for long. In the late 1980s,
Versace, high priest of modern, body-hugging, sexually-charged design,
turned his hand to heraldry and produced a print revolution.
As one of his associates put it: 'However modern his shapes, his designs
always contain historical references, anything from Greek or Etruscan to
medieval culture.'
Presumably, he looked at the ancient banners with their rich heraldic
colours and strange insets of black and white checks reminiscent of 1960s
op-art and evolved designs with his own imaginative input such as
theatrical, operatic or architectural motifs, or a more obviously '60s
slant.
With even more complex designs and colours, and therefore higher price-tags,
than other such prints, Versace's inevitably became the most coveted. At up
to Pounds 1,000, the Versace silk shirt was the ultimate late '80s
status-symbol.
Some have gone into his Signatures collection of classic items that will
last from one season to the next.
The print style - brilliant colour and Baroque gold interspersed with
monochrome geometric sections - has been copied by the high street
manufacturers of the world, often appallingly. Versace himself has wisely
adapted it for his less exalted items. Now you can have an exclusive Versace
print on your boxer shorts.
Diversification is the latest move in the heraldic game. Shirts and scarves
started it, but now those who see these prints as adding a touch of class
can do it in more subtle ways.
For women, it goes from head (hairbands) to toe (slippers and evening
shoes), and from low-key (Sam Browne's fleur-de-lys printed separates in
gold on black silk) to flamboyant (Loewe's print of Spanish nobles on
heraldic-caparisoned horses).
For men, it goes from the obvious ties and cummerbunds to the more subtle -
Hermes' print back on a plain dress-shirt or Gucci's silk-print back on a
suede waistcoat.
At every level of the market, the Christmas pickings of this much-loved look
are rich.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Sport: Sobers swaps his bat for a club - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO MATTER what sport he tries, Sir Garfield St Auburn Sobers always looks as
though he is playing cricket. The golf course is no exception. If he were
only wearing his cricketing whites, the illusion would be complete.
He even plays golf sporting two gloves, batsman style. 'I just couldn't get
used to the feeling of only wearing one,' he grins, wielding his golf club
with the expertise and panache of a batsman. Sobers is a golf addict.
He took up the sport 30 years ago when some Australian test rivals invited
him to play. Now, at 56, he has finally abandoned cricket - a decision
helped by a detached retina in his left eye which is still troubling him. 'I
can see well enough to play golf for the rest of my life. I've done most of
the things that I wanted to do. It would be nice to earn enough to retire
completely and just play golf and travel.'
He also grew fed up with having to produce match-saving feats to order.
'People always expected me to produce a brilliant innings or take a few
wickets even when I was only playing once or twice a year. So I've decided
to quit - I won't even play friendlies. I don't enjoy the game any more.'
Sobers has had arthritis for years, too, but says: 'I don't feel the pain. I
don't even notice that I walk with a limp except when I see myself on TV.'
Although Sobers still haunts the Cricketers Pub which he opened at the
Coconut Creek Hotel in Barbados, he now hits balls at his local golf course
in Sandy Lane, where he has the unofficial freedom of the course. 'Golf is
good for your cricket, but cricket doesn't help your golf,' he explains.
'Golf teaches you patience, which I need, because I'm no good at waiting for
people in front of me - I get so cold and stiff that my golf suffers. It
stops being so fluid if I have to wait. Golf makes you keep your head down
and your upper body still both of which are good for cricket. If you don't
keep your head down at cricket, you can sometimes get away with it; but if
you do that playing golf, you normally hit a bad shot.'
We take shelter during a heavy shower. When it abates, Sobers finds his
young caddy - a novice called Jason Skinner - has allowed the club handles
to get soaked while keeping the blades dry. Wrong way round. He berates the
lad gently, then says: 'He's learning the hard way. So am I]'
Because of the rain, golf carts are not allowed on the course. 'I don't like
this rain,' Sobers says. 'I'm not playing through this, that's for sure]'
When I told Sobers that as long as I hit one good drive every game, I was
happy, he said: 'Don't be so negative. Don't just try for one good drive.
Try for two or three - or four.
'When you start playing golf the most important thing is to hit the ball as
naturally as you can - it doesn't matter where it goes as long as you hit
it. Then, when you know with reasonable certainly that you're going to hit
it, you can start worrying about where you're going to hit it.
'If you start out worrying about where you're going to hit it, you're never
going to hit it well. That's the trouble with most beginners. People have
been playing golf for years who still can't hit it straight. If they could
every golfer would be a pro.'
Easy to say, you might think, for a man virtually born with a cricket bat in
his hands. 'People always say that,' says Sobers. 'It isn't like that at all
really.
'I don't remember when I first picked up a cricket bat, but it was probably
when my father showed me how to. I couldn't bat before I started batting,
you know.'
We are not far from the 4th tee - or is it the 10th? Sandy Lane is two
nine-hole courses welded together. Golfers who just play nine holes do not
simply play the first nine on the 18-hole course.
Sobers explains: 'For example, you might say I only took five at the fourth
and someone would say, but that's a par three. Well, the old four was but
the new one - which is also the 10th - is a par four. Simple, really.'
Simple as the mud on the bunker in front of the third green, which is full
of rainwater. Plop - in goes Sobers' ball, with an answering plop from mine.
Scooping the balls out to the damp sand nearby, both our sand wedge shots
fail. 'We both made the same mistake then,' he says. 'We didn't follow
through properly. Anyway, the course shouldn't really be open in weather
like this.'
He grabs a drink. 'I don't normally bother,' he adds. 'I'm like a camel.'
Halfway round the course we meet Ehrlich Horst, a Kitzbuhel hotelier
enjoying the proceeds of a good skiing winter by spending three weeks in
Barbados. 'Kitzbuhel has a nice course' he volunteers.
'You mean it has mountains?' asks Sobers. 'That's not a nice course. That's
a scenic course. A nice course is a flat course - at least, as far as I'm
concerned without a golf cart]'
In that case, Sobers is unlikely to be enthralled with a new nine-hole
course which will soon be groomed from hundreds of acres of unwanted sugar
cane on a hillside overlooking the present course. The new one has some
wonderful views but, no doubt, Sobers will be less keen to walk up there
unless he is guaranteed a ride.
The sun is going down and the whistling frogs are beginning their dusk
chorus. Sobers has a flight to catch. He is representing the Barbados
Tourist Board in London, and then going on to play some golf. He cannot
leave the game alone. He even writes about golf.
'Golf is the easiest game in the world - to get hooked on. I guarantee that
if you play for a year - not every few weeks, but two or three times a week
 -you'll be hooked. That's the kind of game golf is.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / Sport: Dan Maskell: the voice of Wimbledon - Tennis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY OLD friend Dan Maskell died peacefully in his sleep early on Thursday
morning. I had a premonition it might happen. When I arrived in Munich for
this week's Compaq Grand Slam Cup, I remembered what Dan had told me from
his sick bed before I left home on Monday. Although he found it difficult to
breathe, there was nevertheless still a chuckle in that famous plummy voice.
'Careful now John . . .' he said,' . . . don't catch whatever it was I
caught there last year - I haven't been the same since.'
It was typical of the man - always ready to make light of life's misfortunes
and much more concerned about others than himself.
Dan's was a life of service to others and it brought him immense
satisfaction. Throughout a diverse career that began with his appointment as
full-time ballboy at Queen's Club at the age of 15, he was always giving of
himself.
I first met him in 1948 when, as a promising junior, I was sent along by the
Lawn Tennis Association for national coaching to the All England Club where,
in 1929, Dan had become its first teaching professional. There was the great
man, dressed as always in long cream flannels, putting me at my ease at once
 -but also putting me through my paces thoroughly on the tennis court to
find out what I could do.
Quite soon, it became apparent that I lacked a backhand of any substance. I
do not hold it against Dan that, over the years, he was never able to
eradicate that weakness. Nobody else could, either]
During the war, Dan served as the first rehabilitation officer for the Royal
Air Force. It was a role he accepted with typical enthusiasm and one he
conducted with such distinction that he was awarded the OBE shortly before
he was demobbed. He often spoke in glowing terms of those dedicated days
when wounded air crew would be brought for treatment to the new unit that
had been established at the Palace Hotel in Torquay.
This was an establishment that Dan knew well because of its two beautiful
indoor tennis courts, the stage for many memorable cup matches and
tournaments. He was devastated when a bombing raid destroyed a wing of the
hotel and killed some of the medical staff.
Dealing with the sufferings of others in those years helped to prepare Dan
for the two tragedies that came later in his own life: the loss of his son,
Jay, in an air crash in the West Indies and the drowning of his wife,
Connie, a few years later in the same part of the world. The strand of steel
that lay beneath the reserved, gentlemanly demeanour, together with the
unfailing support of his daughter, Robin, saved him. So did his second
marriage. Kay was the salvation for Dan in his final years and her large
family brought him unexpected joy and happiness.
When he retired from the All England Club in 1955 at the age of 47, Dan
became the LTA's training manager to concentrate on re-organising the
national coaching structure. He felt he was no longer able to play daily for
four hours at the pace of the outstanding young players who had risen to the
top of the British game: men like Roger Becker and Bobby Wilson, Michael
Davies, Billy Knight and Tony Pickard. These fellows were the nucleus of my
Davis Cup teams in those years and I always took care to see that Dan would
be around during our matches. His fund of stories - some taller than others
 -always helped to keep the atmosphere relaxed. More importantly, the
fellows trusted him and respected his deep knowledge of the game and his
dedication - just as the winning teams of the 1930s had done. After all, Dan
had been the professional champion of Great Britain 16 times and could boast
a win over the legendary Bill Tilden.
Dan was justly proud of the part he played in those golden years with Fred
Perry and Bunny Austin, Pat Hughes, Raymond Tuckey and Harry Lee. The
reunion of that triumphant team one year, during one of Fred's spectacular
birthday parties at Wimbledon, was a special day for him.
It was Dan's friendly and relaxed personality that enabled him to bridge the
gap between the Upstairs-Downstairs world in which he had grown up and the
glittering world of international tennis. He helped to accelerate the social
changes that seemed so slow in coming. When he first joined the All England
Club, he was allowed to change in the members' dressing room - a practice
unheard-of at Queen's Club. Imagine his pride when, in 1953, he was elected
as the first professional honorary member at Wimbledon. He had also been the
first professional to be sent abroad with a national team in those glorious
Davis Cup years.
It was as the voice of Wimbledon for BBC television that Dan will best be
remembered. Over a span of 41 years his obvious respect for the game, its
traditions and its performers shone through in all he did. There was a
humility about him that all the great champions have possessed. Sitting
beside him in the commentary box was a privilege I enjoyed for 21 years. He
did his homework meticulously and had an instinctive way of knowing how to
enhance the enjoyment of the viewer by highlighting the reason behind the
outcome of a point. Never the needless chatter. Better complete silence so
as not to intrude on the viewer's enjoyment of the action. It was a formula
that was the envy of other broadcasters and built for Dan an army of fans.
In spite of the tragedies in his life, Dan used to say that he was one of
the luckiest men alive. His love affair with tennis had begun early in life,
while first skiing and then golf had provided the relaxation. The love
affair never died. He saw his first Wimbledon final in 1924, when Kitty
Godfree inflicted on Helen Wills the only defeat the great American ever
suffered there. Then, from 1929 to 1991, he saw every day of play.
I shall remember Dan best for his generosity of spirit. He never said a mean
word about anybody - though he would get justly angry at some of the
outrageous behaviour he had to witness. Yes, he was a lucky man in many
ways, but the ones who can really consider themselves lucky are those whom
he counted as friends - and they are many. I am proud to have been one of
them.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Sport: The turnover law that needs to be scrapped - Rugby
Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of appearances to the contrary, Twickenham was not full for
Tuesday's Varsity match. One seat was left empty when the ticket-holder, who
gets vertigo, discovered the height of the west stand's upper tier. She
retired to the car park and listened on the radio.
Perhaps she was the lucky one. The rest of us had to endure one of the
poorest Varsity matches since the mid-1960s - as poor, incidentally, as the
scratchy recording of the national anthem that was played before the start.
The Varsity match merits more than a worn recording. Why not a a band?
My main complaint centres not on the standard of play but the style, which
was a direct result of the new laws - especially, the turnover law. I left
my (Oxford) seat with a deep sense of disappointment.
The first I saw of the new laws was at Aberavon on a sunny afternoon last
September when Cardiff were the visitors. The home club had printed a list
of the changes as explained by Clive Norling, the referee. There were more
than 20 of them.
Cardiff won comfortably enough but Aberavon once caught their opponents
napping with a quickly-taken throw-in that almost resulted in a try. The
opportunism this law change was meant to encourage was evident.
Since then, I have seen one game each Saturday and a few in midweek as well.
It is clear that most of the changes are working well. The experimental
line-out variation, which says the catcher must use both hands or his inside
arm to grab the ball, is sensible: it stops players levering themselves up
on rivals' shoulders. I am glad, too, that the scrum-half can no longer dart
away from a scrum in a dummy move.
On the other hand, the turnover law has not worked at all well. It says: 'In
a maul when the ball becomes unplayable, the team not in possession at the
start of the maul will put the ball in to the ensuing scrummage.' It quickly
became known as the 'use it or lose it' law and, in principle, it seemed
sensible. Its aim was to encourage teams to ruck or maul the ball back more
quickly, so that play would be more dynamic.
In drafting this law, the International Board were accepting the perceived
wisdom that there is a New Age of rugby. The game is undergoing a
renaissance in style and popularity now that it has become a running,
handling affair in which forwards run like backs and backs tackle like
forwards.
Rugby is growing in popularity, for players and spectators, in a way it has
not done since, nearly 30 years ago, kicking to touch was banned from
outside your own 22.
Yet, on the evidence of this season in Europe, the turnover law has done the
opposite of what was intended. Teams get into their opponents' territory and
kick the ball high in the air as an attacking ploy, rather than run at them
and risk conceding the put-in at a scrum.
Furthermore, it encourages the defending side's back row to stand off at
rucks so they are ready to move around the field and end attacks. This means
that games become stop-start. In those I have watched this season, not one
has contained sustained attacking rugby.
The greatest try I have seen was scored by the Lions in South Africa in
1980. The ball went through 32 pairs of hands and the movement lasted 96
seconds before Mike Slemen, the wing, touched down.
Under the present turnover law, it would not have happened. The referee
would have blown up at the first ruck, after 14 seconds, and given a scrum
to the home side.
Bob Dwyer, the Australian coach, hates the turnover law because it is
stifling initiative. Lyn Evans, the Oxford coach, said after Tuesday's loss:
'The game has less shape and pattern to it now.' It was not sour grapes.
Tony Rodgers, the long-time coach of Cambridge, agrees. 'Players are
stacking up in midfield. No wonder you can't get attacking moves going. You
have got to suck in the forwards, make them do their jobs of winning the
ball.'
Grappling for the ball in a maul, or getting it back with the feet in a
ruck, are legitimate skills of the game. Sadly, they have been devalued by
the turnover law, which encourages opponents to kill the ball because they
know they will get the put-in at the ensuing scrum. Thus, rugby is becoming
more defensive at a time when it is trying hard to do the opposite.
Fortunately, the turnover law is not written in stone; it is an experiment.
The IB will review it in the spring. My advice is succinct: scrap it and go
back to the old law.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Property: House-hunting season in Hardy country - The green
rolling valleys and attractive coastline of Dorset offer stimulating
pastimes and a variety of properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN FOUL WEATHER think of Dorset, that contented, homely county where only
spring and summer seem to reign. If you look for a house there now, the
winter gales sweeping in from the Channel promise a few thousand pounds more
off already competitive prices.
A drive of two to three hours from London by the A303 (worth the trouble for
the sudden magic of coming on Stonehenge shortly after Amesbury) or the M3,
Dorset is a different, self-sufficient world of rolling hills and wonderful
walks, villages nestled in tree-packed hidden valleys, and old market towns
of great charm, and good shopping, such as Sherborne, Blandford, Wareham,
Shaftesbury, Bridport and the county town, Dorchester. The Blackmore Vale,
known for its hunt, runs through the middle of the county.
The coast is superb for swimming and sailing, offering a choice between
lonely beaches or developments, especially around Poole harbour, that are
the nearest England comes to a riviera. The Weymouth ferry is an escape
route to France but Dorset itself has any number of places for expeditions,
from the Swannery at Abbotsbury or Thomas Hardy's study in the delightful
Dorchester museum, to Maiden Castle, a whale of a prehistoric hill fort just
outside Dorchester.
Houses on the market are of unusual interest for the slack season. Top
billing goes to Thornhill Park, a splendid Palladian house near Sherborne
which belongs to John Rew, co-editor of the Lloyd's Chatset reports, and his
wife.
Sir James Thornhill, responsible for the dome of St Paul's and the Painted
Hall at Greenwich, rebuilt the house in the 1720s and that is, on the whole,
how it remains today, restored lovingly by the Rews.
With its own obelisk, fabulous views over Blackmore Vale, 185 acres, a dower
house and a lodge, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley (071-629-8171), Michael de Pelet in
Sherborne (0935-812-236) and Symonds &amp; Sampson in Dorchester (0305-264-172)
offers this Grade II* house at around Pounds 1m.
Huish Manor, near Blandford, is a late Georgian house from the 1790s,
offered at around Pounds 875,000 from Strutt &amp; Parker in Salisbury
(0722-328-741). The gardens are so fine that only devotees should think of
this property, although the heated indoor swimming pool sounds perfect for
winter.
Still more horticultural commitment is needed from those considering Clapton
Court on the Somerset-Dorset border, offered by Lane Fox (071-499-4785) at
around Pounds 1.2m, including cottages. These could be sold separately but
probably are essential for housing plantsmen to look after the superb
gardens, which are open most of the year and known to all serious gardeners.
Those considering the part-Tudor, part-Victorian Compton House near
Sherborne need not be committed to butterflies and silk worms. It is at
present home base for Worldwide Butterflies and the Lullingstone silk farm -
renowned for making the silk for the Queen's coronation dress - which are
not part of the sale. But, with 50 rooms, it might be wise to think of a
business use for the house, on sale from Savills in Wimborne (0202-887-331)
at Pounds 1m.
In nearby Nether Compton, Savills (acting with Humberts in Sherborne:
0935-816-909) has the mellow Old Rectory, complete with the vicar's billiard
room and orangery, at around Pounds 525,000. Maiden Newton House, offered by
Symonds &amp; Sampson at around Pounds 550,000, is another 19th century rectory,
this one with fishing on the Frome which flows through the grounds.
Weston House, perched on a clifftop at West Lulworth and built by Edwin
Lutyens for George V's surgeon, Sir Alfred Fripp, is also with Savills. The
guide price of Pounds 375,000 is attractive for what stands out at once as
Lutyens' work: a brick manor with projecting eaves and prominently leaded
windows.
Another impressive property by a well known architect - this time the
Victorian, GE Street - is Kingston House, originally a rectory, in the
middle of the Isle of Purbeck and two miles from Corfe Castle. Jackson-Stops
in Yeovil (0935-74066) offers it at around Pounds 675,000. The firm has
another old rectory at Frome Vauchurch, in the Frome valley, for about
Pounds 485,000.
Between Street and Lutyens in date are two Tudoresque houses. One is the
half-timbered Chaffcombe House just across the county boundary near Chard in
Somerset, offered by Michael de Pelet and Knight, Frank &amp; Rutley at around
Pounds 425,000. The other is the stone Dower House at Parnham (John
Makepeace's furniture studio is in the big house), with Savills at around
Pounds 385,000.
The pick of the village houses is the grand Dawnay House in Puddletown
outside Dorchester, a listed Grade II* Queen Anne-Georgian building with
original oak staircase. Savills is offering it at over Pounds 200,000.
The attractive Old Manor Farmhouse at Marnhull, Dorset's largest village
which prospered on the wool trade, dates even earlier to the time of Charles
I and is offered at around Pounds 235,000 by Jackson-Stops.
Thornton Cottage at Moorside, near Shaftesbury, is offered at Pounds 190,000
by Knight Frank &amp; Rutley and Michael de Pelet. Ware Farmhouse near Lyme
Regis, with spectacular views of the Dorset coast, is with Jackson-Stops at
around Pounds 350,000 while an inland farmhouse, Benville House near
Dorchester - which has a paddock available for anyone who fancies hunting
with the Cattistock - is offered at over Pounds 250,000 by Symonds &amp;
Sampson. The Old Forge in the lovely village of Milton Abbas is also on
offer from Savills at around Pounds 170,000.
Sailors will think hard about Moriconium Quay at Poole harbour. It is a new
'Mediterranean-style' development of apartments and houses on 125-year
leases, each of which has a 43ft berth for a boat right on the doorstep.
Prices at the Quay - Moriconium is the Roman name for Poole - start at
Pounds 285,000 from Savills.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Motoring: Best of both worlds - Volvo's hybrid runs on
batteries in town and a gas turbine elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE really knows what kind of cars we will be driving 10 years from now,
although it is a safe bet that most will have internal combustion engines.
But they will create less pollution than vehicles today: politicians, and a
rising ground swell of public opinion in favour of environmental protection,
will see to that.
Some, but not many, will be electric. They will be confined mainly to city
centres and could be the only kind of car allowed in the most
environmentally sensitive areas.
The idea of an almost silent, non-polluting electric car is attractive but
the problems are great. Relatively cheap lead-acid batteries are extremely
heavy while more efficient batteries - which are far from lightweight,
anyway - are costly.
For at least 30 years, there has been talk of a radically new kind of
battery that would make electric cars competitive with petrol or diesel
cars. The breakthrough seems as far away as ever. Electric town cars of the
mid-1990s will be conversions of existing models like the Citroen AX, Fiat
Cinquecento and Peugeot 106. Later, purpose-designed battery-driven town
cars will be introduced.
Nearly all the major manufacturers have made battery-powered conversions of
their smaller petrol cars and delivery vans. Most also have displayed
advanced electric car prototypes at motor shows. But all battery-driven cars
have a problem.
They can provide good acceleration and a reasonable highway cruising speed,
or an operating range approaching that of a normal car on, say, a half-tank
of petrol. But not both. So, while a battery vehicle might be practical as a
second car, used for short range commuting or shopping, it is a non-starter
as an alternative to the family-cum-business car.
Enter the hybrid. It offers the best of both worlds by running on
electricity in town and petrol or diesel on the highway. As a battery car,
its speed and range are modest but sufficient. Out of town, though, it goes
like a normal vehicle. Its engine is quite small and creates minimal
pollution because it runs at a fairly constant speed and is coupled to a
generator feeding current via the batteries to an electric drive motor.
Most of the time, the hybrid is no more than an internal combustion-engined
car with an electric transmission. But for overtaking or hill climbing, the
power stored in the batteries (which the engine keeps fully charged, of
course) provides a useful performance boost.
The concept is not new. I drove an experimental Fiat 131 hybrid, with a
one-litre Fiat 127 engine, about 20 years ago. Advanced petrol and
diesel-electric hybrids based on the VW Golf and Audi quattro were seen at
Geneva show in 1990.
PSA (Peugeot-Citroen), a leader in developing practical battery-electric
cars, unveiled a diesel hybrid 405 estate last year with a 130 kmh (81 mph)
top speed and a range of 750 km (470 miles) at 100 kph (58 mph). A more
advanced PSA hybrid, with a gas turbine-driven generator, is under
development. But little Volvo (well, it is little in the car makers'
international pecking order) unveiled a turbo hybrid a few weeks ago at the
Paris show and brought it out again at Birmingham.
Volvo's ECC (for environmental concept car) is based on the theory that
although cars must be environmentally clean, they need to be proper
five-seaters and not - in the words of its design director, Englishman Peter
Horbury - 'Dan Dare shopping baskets.'
The EEC, which I drove very briefly in Sweden this week, is just that. A
medium/large four-door saloon of most un-Volvo-like elegance, it has a
small, diesel-fuelled gas turbine coupled directly to a high speed
generator. This spins so fast - at up to 90,000 rpm, the same speed as the
turbine - that it need be only a fraction of the size and weight of a
conventional generator.
Its 40 kw (call it 56 horsepower) output might not sound much for a car the
size of a Volvo 850. But the ECC is aerodynamically slippery and has tyres
with low rolling resistance. And although a 770 lb (350 kg) battery pack
accounts for 22 per cent of its total weight, it is still fairly light.
This makes it reasonably lively (a top speed of 108 mph/175 kh) and very
frugal: 47 mpg (6.0 l/100km) in town and 54 mpg (5.2 l/100 km) on the open
road. On a full tank, it will go for 416 miles (670 km) at 56 mph (90 kmh.
Exhaust emissions from the gas turbine are lower than those of any car in
use today.
The ECC has a two-speed automatic tranmission and front-wheel drive. When I
tried it, the batteries were partly discharged, but I reckoned it would have
held its own in town traffic. The gas turbine takes 30 seconds to start,
during which the EEC can be driven on its batteries. Its odd, but not
objectionable, whine can hardly be heard inside the car.
Do not plan on buying an ECC, though. The only one in existence reflects so
much research and development that it must be worth nearly its weight in
gold. In any case, it is a working concept, not a production prototype.
A hybrid car can never be as cheap as a straightforward petrol or diesel
vehicle. It does, after all, have two power units. But Volvo thinks the
electrical and electronic equipment should not be too expensive if produced
in quantity. And it says the gas turbine is not much more complicated than a
turbo-charger.
So, it seems that in the increasingly green years that lie ahead, a hybrid's
price might have to be paid if we want to drive proper, full-sized cars in
towns - or, perhaps, even drive them at all.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Skiing: Pure magic in Jackson Hole
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SKIERS, there is nowhere quite like Jackson Hole, Wyoming. But the
sporting appeal goes only part of the way to explaining Jackson's qualities.
If you simply moved Jackson's Rendezvous and Apre Vous mountains to the
French alps - where it sounds as if they belong; they were named by early
French trappers - you would have a resort no better than Les Arcs or
Courchevel and perhaps not even as good as Val d'Isere or Argentiere. So,
the secret is not entirely in Jackson's skiing (although, with its chutes
and gullies, bowls, and wide-open, fast cruising trails, it certainly is
excellent).
One of the other attractions is the vast, desolate and beautiful Teton
mountains with their huge, lop-sided, jagged peaks that spring up from the
flat valley floor like a pre-historic tidal wave of snow-drenched granite.
They have a permanently startling quality, as if the Matterhorn had suddenly
reared out of a Dutch plain.
Jackson has the largest elk reserve in the world, which you can view from
horse-drawn sleds. The town itself - with its wooden footpaths, shops
selling cowboy clothes and Indian art, and pleasantly rowdy bars - just
oozes visions of the old Wild West. Even executives from rival ski resorts
drool over Jackson Hole.
Take Al Roman, the village manager for 20 years at Copper Mountain,
Colorado. 'I just adore Wyoming,' he said. 'Hell, do you realise that the
entire population of the state is only just over a quarter of a million.
There's hardly any crime - there aren't enough people to form a gang. As for
Jackson - what a mountain. And such a quaint old town.'
There are changes afoot, though. Paul McCollister, who discovered the
mountain and built the resort in the 1960s, has retired after a lengthy
legal dispute with a wealthy Dutch shareholder that, effectively, put
Jackson's master plan in mothballs. Others are now in charge, and one of
their projects is to build badly-needed new lifts. The irresistible force of
progress has returned.
There is an obvious danger, of course, that Jackson could be ruined by
commercialisation, strangling the very qualities which make it so
attractive. There is similar concern for Telluride, another unusually
beautiful ski area which celebrities have patronised as the new Aspen - to
the dismay of the locals.
Jackson Hole's new chief executive John Resor, seems well aware of this. A
local ranch owner, with a reputation for his environmental awareness, he is
determined not to kill the goose that lays such golden eggs.
Jackson Hole might not be the best ski resort in the world if you count the
numbers of lifts, runs and snow cannon. But if you are looking for the whole
cocktail of startling scenery, exhilarating skiing, western ambience,
perhaps a moose or two foraging under the cable car, and a sense of
beautiful if slightly disturbing desolation - then seek no further.
Arnold Wilson was a guest at Jackson Hole of Ski Scott Dunn, Fovant Mews,
12a Noyna Road, London SW17 7PH. Tel. 081-767-0202.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Gardening: Now British Rail has the wrong sort of trees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MY YEARLY advice to Christmas shoppers has been to buy a plant which is not
a flowering plant or an over-forced plant but an honest, well-rooted mass of
twigs which will grow, last for years, and do all the things which other
Christmas presents cannot. I now realise that this yearly advice is
unsatisfactory. There are also some unreconstructed characters who dislike
gardening, dodge it all year, and wish that their partners were not
fanatics. They tend to be husbands and many of them commute.
So, I am particularly pleased to announce that we have a new initiative for
them, backed wholeheartedly by the InterCity division of British Rail.
Indeed, according to BR's customer relations manager, it is actually the
'best solution.'
This 'best solution' first came to my notice at St Pancras station in
London. Earlier this summer, England's most distinguished plantswoman,
Valerie Finnis, found herself waiting for the train to Kettering,
Northamptonshire, during one of those periods of 'delayed boarding.'
She was surprised to notice that more than 30 trees, about 15 ft high, had
been arranged down the Pancras platforms in smart new containers of silver
aluminium. It looked as if Birnam Wood had come south on an Away Day pass;
and so she stood on her luggage to check out the leaves.
The trunk, she found, had once been a tree, but the entire head of leaves
was fake. There was no mistaking the soil, which looked like a mass of
chocolate-coated beans. So, she wrote to BR's chairman, asking why living
trees had not been chosen and what this new initiative cost. At the
chairman's request, David Gibb replied to her query.
The management, he told her, had been 'anxious to put some colour into St
Pancras' but the presence of high voltage overhead cables had restricted the
choice severely. 'Live trees grow,' he reminded one of our greatest lady
gardeners. There was also that universal apology, health and safety. If live
trees grew, 'there would obviously be a fire hazzard.' And, he pointed out:
'There would be safety implications for staff climbing the trees in order to
lop them.'
Safety implications, meanwhile, caused an unforeseen outbreak of 'driver
hazzard.' The trees had been stationed so thickly on the platforms that the
drivers could not see the guards; and so the trees, pots and all, had to be
shunted to the side of vacant platform one. It was there that I found them
on Monday while preparing my Christmas list for garden owners who hate
gardening.
If you stand on platform one, the view soars upwards to the vast height of
St Pancras, way above any tree-watchers or any tip of a plausible tree.
After 100 years, a Wellingtonia might be somewhere near the cables in
question, but a native birch or a hornbeam would have no chance of making
contact.
A watching porter explained to me, kindly, that so far from being scaled by
workmen, the new trees had been climbed already by drunkards. Thanks to the
'alcoholic hazzard,' two of the trees had split at the top, unable to
support a visitor's weight.
Despite several inquiries, neither BR's chairman nor his management were
prepared to reveal where our nationalised transporters had bought these
trees on our behalf. But friendly railway security staff were more willing
to reveal all. In the last instance, the trees came from Rentokil, and were
ordered for St Pancras by BR's procurement and materials management
division, located some way up the track at Derby.
At Derby, I was pleased to learn from the helpful staff that the new
initiative was part of a campaign for 'passenger environment' and that about
200 trees had been distributed round major stations from St Pancras to
Cardiff, York and Newcastle - at a cost well in excess of Pounds 100,000.
Under recent reforms, stations (like schools) are now managing part of their
own regional budgets. To mark their new responsibilities, InterCity managers
have been buying fake trees at about Pounds 500 a time.
Naturally, they are not just any old trees. Gardeners will recognise them as
models of good old Ficus Benjamina, which is not an outdoor tree in Britain
but is merely the most familiar of tender green trees for people whose
horizons are limited to offices. These specimens are extremely trendy. In
keeping with the best FT advice, a climber has been placed carefully so that
it looks as if it is climbing up the main trunk. The climber is dead, of
course: a vine stem which has been twined so as to look realistic.
After less than a year in position, the textured leaves are filthy, as we
would have expected in an area of high pollution. Rentokil, I trust, has a
cleaning and fire-retardent contract; like real trees, sham trees on
stations are expensive to maintain.
Rentokil felt unable to supply further details of these trees' origin.
Where, then, would you and I go to find one for a non-gardening friend?
My first stop would be Clifton Nurseries, in London's Little Venice, where
the friendly house-plant managers can cope with every sort of up-market
inquiry. Yes, they could always supply such a tree and I should realise that
its leaves were not plastic but polyester silk. But why did I not talk first
to the British company with the most experience of assembling them?
Down at the Marley industrial estate in Southam Road, Banbury, Oxfordshire,
the expert firm of Pouliot Designs has been assembling non-living trees for
the past 10 years. Indeed, it even began assembling them in a barn about 100
yards away from my family home - the site of my first 20 gardening years.
Throughout that time, I was encouraging you all to dig and prepare big holes
for fine trees which needed watering: in fact, you could have bought one,
ready-hung and without any need for soil or effort, just down the road where
Des, the proprietor, had cashed in his retirement Jaguar and handshake and
sunk them all in the business which now leads the field.
At Pouliot, they were very pleased to have been honoured with the British
Rail order. The leaves are brought in containers from factories in China.
Pouliot then arranges for dead trunks locally, with the help of the Forestry
Commission, and its loyal workforce puts the Chinese leaves on the dead
stems.
The bestseller is Ficus Benjamina, presumably because it is the tree which
looks most familiar to the budget-spender who passes more time in his office
than his garden. But Pouliot has been trying to introduce the Chinese
workforce to the leaves of British favourites, and oaks will be available
soon.
Meanwhile, spun aluminium containers are supplied by Lune of Morecambe,
Lancashire. Pouliot will assemble the two and add dead vine but will always
direct you, after discussion, to one of its retail buyers. It is a
wholesaler and deals only with the trade.
Have we all been dreadfully stupid? We dig holes, summon manure and hunt for
tree stakes but, down at Pouliot, Des and the ladies could run off an oak
tree, 15 ft high in a spun aluminium container with earth-like chocolate
nuts, and not leave too much change from Pounds 1,500. Meanwhile, station
budgets in the InterCity section of British Rail have blown more than Pounds
100,000 on some dead tree trunks, scattered with pseudo-silk leaves from
China.
Every extravagance has its own neurotic origin: we must all remember that
real trees must touch off British Rail's deepest anxiety - that infamous
hazzard of leaves on the track. Perhaps the InterCity stations are only
phase one of a grander vision radiating out from Derby. Bogus trees will
then be pilot-tested for placing on sections of the embankment which have
been proven to be at risk, thereby eliminating a major autumn source of
delay.
It will certainly be good business, and I hope the Chinese can cope with
demand. Meanwhile, we can well understand why our British Rail network is so
keen to point out to us that it is seriously short of necessary funding.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Practical Traveller: A supersonic experience - David Pilling
tries (and fails) to travel cheaply on Concorde
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID PILLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCORDE is for the seriously rich. A standard British Airways return fare
to New York costs Pounds 5,030 plus tax - Pounds 670 per hour on board -
while a cheap-day Concorde return is priced at Pounds 4,156.
It may be a soul-stirring experience to arrive in New York an hour and 10
minutes before you departed - the flight leaves daily at 10.30am and touches
down at JFK at 9.20am - but most souls can be stirred for a much more modest
sum.
Before you despair of breaking the sound barrier, however, there may be
cheaper options. Be warned, though: I said cheaper options; cheap I did not
say.
For the absolute miser - in Concorde terms this represents someone with
Pounds 500 or so to blow on 20 minutes of supersonic bliss - you could fly
to France. Paris Travel Service (tel: 0920-467-467) has chartered Concorde
five times next year and will, for Pounds 598, whisk you to Paris for a
night. On the outbound flight, Concorde takes a detour over the Bay of
Biscay where it slips into supersonic realms. Returnees limp home on
scheduled subsonic flights. The first 1993 departure is April 25.
The same company sometimes has last-minute deals on unsold seats, which it
sells as day trips, usually for a little under Pounds 300.
Goodwood Travel (0227-764-949) specialises in Concorde charters and has, in
its nine-year history, flown to 39 destinations. Next year you can be sped
to St Petersburg (for the Kirov), Moscow (for the Bolshoi), Monaco (for the
grand prix) or Cairo (for the hell of it). Prices range from about Pounds
925 (Paris) to Pounds 2,250 (Egypt, including a seven-day Nile cruise and
time in Luxor).
If you get your skates on, you could fly to Finnish Lappland for Christmas,
including the opportunity - should you wish - of visiting the Santa Claus
village. Goodwood's Lappland departures this month start at Pounds 1,295.
Another Concorde idea for the festive season is the so-called Atlantic Time
Tunnel which offers the chance to celebrate New Year's Eve twice in the same
year. Passengers, paying Pounds 3,999, celebrate the end of 1992 in Shannon,
in the west of Ireland, until half-past-midnight, at which point their
champagne is confiscated and they are herded on to Concorde for the
three-hour flight to Bermuda. Here they become acquainted with their old
friend 1993 for the second time that evening.
The Guinness Book of Records will be monitoring the event which, if
successful, will be a world first. Two nights later, Concorde takes you on
to New York for a Bloomingdale's reception (Dollars 10,000 to spend for one
lucky passenger) and from there, on January 3, back to London. For bookings,
contact Hogg Robinson (081-897-2525).
For those who prefer their supersonic travel at a more leisurely pace,
Elegant Resorts (0244-329-671) can fix you up with Concorde extravaganzas to
Barbados. For Pounds 2,775 you can secure seven nights in a Treasure Beach
ocean view suite (b&amp;b), flying out on Concorde and back on BWIA first class.
The standard Concorde return fare to Barbados is Pounds 4,228.
On most of the packages mentioned, your planemates are likely to include
those for whom Concorde is something special: honeymooners, those
celebrating anniversaries and romantics with long-cherished supersonic
dreams. They will not be those for whom Concorde is merely a rapid means of
shuttling between important meetings in London, New York and Washington.
Your fellow travellers are likely to celebrate the supersonic experience
with champagne, caviar and an expedition to the cockpit. Scheduled
passengers, by all accounts, spend the 3 1/2 -hour transatlantic trip
looking underwhelmed (but smart), sipping carbonated water, waving away
expensive food and giving the impression that, for them, Concorde is a
weekly event.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Travel: Karaoke and Sumo in remote Ogasawara - A
sub-tropical area of Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER MCCOOEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NOTICE on the door leading to the upper deck said 'Closed against rough
weather.' It was beginning to seem like an understatement. The ship had left
the comparative shelter of Tokyo Bay and was heading south right through a
typhoon. Waves slapped at the portholes, the curtains swayed, plates crashed
in the galley.
When the ship began to roll while doing a handstand, I knew that my proud
record of never having been seasick was about to founder. Next morning
Typhoon 23 had blown eastwards; the ship settled into a rhythm of lethargic
rolls. By mid-day, craggy islands were growing on the horizon ahead.
The Ogasawara group consists of about 30 islands located from 900km to
1,200km south-south-east of Tokyo in the same latitude as Florida and the
Canaries. Administratively part of Tokyo, one of the most crowded areas on
earth, they could not be more of a contrast.
The largest island, Chichijima (24.5 sq km), the one we were heading for,
has a population of about 1,500 and the second largest, Hahajima, only 400.
There is no airport - one is planned but conservationists could well delay
its construction indefinitely - so the only way to get there is by boat, and
the weekly ferry from Tokyo takes about 30 hours.
The islands were first spotted by the Spanish merchant adventurer Villalobos
in 1543 and over the next 300 years were claimed at different times by
Japan, Russia, Britain and the US. Sometimes called the Bonin Islands
('bonin' is a corrupted form of a Japanese word which means 'empty of
people'), they were first settled by two Americans, an Englishmen, a Dane
and an Italian. This motley crew had known about the islands from their days
on whaling boats and had sailed from America's west coast in 1830, stopping
off for water and women in Hawaii en route. To this day, western features
can still be seen among some of the islanders, and western names are still
evident.
The evening I arrived happened to coincide with the island's 12th annual
Karaoke Taikai, or Grand Challenge Singing Competition. Held on a community
stage in an amphitheatre hacked from volcanic rock beside the Shinto shrine
overlooking the harbour, there were 43 acts competing for a first prize of
about Pounds 425.
The compere announced Savoury Daniel (Japanese give the family name first) -
the great-great-grandson of one of the original settlers. A Rhett Butler
lookalike, complete with black moustache and cowboy hat, bounded onto the
stage; he brought the house down with a country and western song, in
English.
Others were not so well received. One tuneless tubby guy with a T-shirt that
said 'Unsung Heroes' was booed off the stage and helped on his way with a
fusillade of mandarin oranges. Further light relief was provided by a boiled
egg eating competition. The winner gobbled 10 and won a colour TV.
Next day, most people were back for the Sumo Taikai, children during the
afternoon, adults in the evening. On a proper clay ring under a tarpaulin in
the grounds of the Shinto shrine, the wrestlers fought keenly as team
members (the self-defence force, the police, the farmers' and fishermen's
co-operatives) or as individuals. In typical egalitarian fashion, every
wrestler got a prize - a memorial key ring. But the winners were honoured
with extra goodies: rolls of lavatory paper, cans of lager, pens.
Two hours by ferry from Chichijima is the other main inhabited island,
Hahajima. I checked into a minshuku three minutes from the quay, bought a
cold beer from the co-op and sat on the beach, shaded by an hibiscus tree.
The pace of life is even slower on Hahajima but I was not complaining,
having spent the previous two months living with my in-laws in what amounted
to four smoke-filled cupboards in downtown Tokyo.
After a snooze, I began to look around. Islanders make a living from
construction (new roads, breakwaters), agriculture (papaya and zucchini),
tourism (bird and whale watching, diving) and fishing (sport and
commercial).
In the harbour was a large pen. Inside were half-a-dozen turtles flapping
lethargically every now and then, snorting their displeasure at their
confinement when they came to the surface. A fisherman told me that they
sold for Y60,000 and every part of the animal was used. The islanders eat
them, but for how long is debatable. The island's last whaling station bowed
to international pressure and closed in the mid-1980s.
The next day I hiked to the southern end of Hahajima. It was beginning to
blow up a storm. Typhoon 24 (rather unimaginatively, the Japanese do not
give them names, like the Americans, but numbers) was heading right for the
island. The seas on the exposed east side were mighty - great whirls of
seawater topped by orange-coloured froth - and turquoise waves rushed to
dash themselves on the rocks, sending huge plumes of spray right over the
island.
I went underground for shelter. A whole network of caves and tunnels had
been built during the second world war to defend the islands from the
Americans. The defensive positions still have their searchlights and guns,
although slowly the warm tropical sea air is eating them away.
Sugar cane is an ideal crop to grow in subtropical areas prone to typhoons.
It bends but is not flattened. On Hahajima a company has been formed to make
white rum from cane juice. Asafluma san showed me around his spotless
distillery. The first batch of the liquor was not yet ready.
After the tour we settled down to a sampling session which involved cutting
the tops off locally-grown passion fruit, loosening the glutenous pips with
a spoon and topping up with the nearly-ready white rum. A pleasant glow
began to steal over me; by the fourth fruit I sensed a remarkable
transformation - my Japanese had progressed from basic to fluent.
The drink may have had something to do with the misunderstanding. From the
distillery Asanuma san and I made our way to one of three bars on the
island. As the only gaijin in town, I was something of a curiosity. A
stranger came up to me and whispered 'shonyudo' in my ear. I was stunned -
an island of just 400 people and it boasted a nude show. I indicated my
interest. 'Me,' he said, putting his index finger on his nose to make it
clear who was whom, 'guide san.'
I was perking up fast. 'You have flashlight? Rope?' he asked. My goodness, a
nude show that required a torch and rope. 'When?' I asked, trying to enter
into the conspiratorial style of the conversation. 'Eight tomorrow.'
'Tomorrow night?' 'Morning,' he said. 'You what?' I said, but he had gone.
The stalactite grotto hall - shonyudo in Japanese - was the highlight of my
visit to Hahajima. Without a guide it is difficult to find (an
hour-and-a-half walk through the forest), and the entrance so narrow that I
seriously thought I would be stuck there a week until I'd lost weight.
The grotto was a sloping cave about 50ft underground full of stalactites and
mites, the colour of butter toffee. As we threaded our way through them,
tapping them gently with our torches, they rang as sonorously as tubular
bells, and soothed my hangover.
Getting there: the Ogasawara Maru sails five times a month from Takeshiba
pier on the Tokyo waterfront. The dates can be obtained (with a fact sheet
on the islands in English) from the tourist information centre at 6-6
Yurakucho 1-chome, Chiyoda-ku, Tokyo 100, tel: 03-3502-1461. For July and
August, the busiest months, it is best to book three months in advance. Out
of the peak months, a one-way ticket costs about Pounds 100 (blankets,
pillow and your own floor space in open plan cabin; meals not included).
There are also four-berth cabins. The journey takes about 30 hours. Tickets
can be bought from any Japan Travel Bureau.
Between Chichijima and Hahajima a ferry takes two hours and sails six times
a week.
The cheapest place to stay on Chichijima is the Silver Moon, Y3,500 per
person but with no meals. The Villa Seaside is scruffy but friendly and
costs Y5,500 per person with breakfast and dinner. On Hahajima, Tsuki costs
Y6,500 per person and has excellent fresh sea fish for breakfast and dinner.
Bicycles and mopeds can be rented. Forest trails are well signposted.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Severance payment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I recently accepted early severance from my employer. The financial package
was a lump sum amounting to Pounds 60,000. There were no other compensatory
payments. On the lump sum, I was taxed approximately Pounds 21,500, as a
considerable amount was at 40 per cent. Come April, I will be able to
calculate the tax due for 1992/3 based on total earnings. I am writing about
'top slicing.' I have never understood the implications. Can I take
advantage of it?
Unfortunately, top-slicing relief does not apply to severance payments like
yours.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Joint assets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM UNCLEAR as to the income tax, capital gains tax and inheritance tax
position of a husband and wife who own assets jointly but whose tax rates
are different (mine 40 per cent, hers 25 per cent). We own jointly building
society accounts worth Pounds 80,000 but are considering joint ownership of
shares and our home (between them, worth Pounds 200,000-Pounds 250,000,
depending on the housing market). The house is in my name only at present.
Should I die, my estate would exceed the nil rate band several times (before
the house/shares transfer referred to); my wife's would only just exceed it
(again, before the proposed further joint ownership of assets).
Would the income and capital value of jointly owned assets be divided
equally between us, for all the three categories of tax, or would different
treatment be levied for different (ie, each) categories. Also, if at any
time we wished to transfer absolutely the ownership of certain jointly held
assets to one or other partner, is this permissible by the Revenue, even if
it meant a lower overall tax payment?
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR80(1992) on the taxation of
married couples. The basic rule is that income from joint accounts and joint
shareholdings is split 50:50 for income tax purposes, and that the proceeds
(and cost) are similarly split 50:50 for capital gains tax purposes.
However, there are wider-ranging anti-avoidance provisions to catch
transfers into joint names which are motivated by a desire to reduce the
family tax bills, rather than to give the other spouse a measure of
financial independence. If you want greater details of these anti-avoidance
provisions, you should ask also for the free booklet IR83 (1990) on
independent taxation.
On the death of either of you, jointly owned investments and accounts would
vest in the survivor, so there would be no question of an inheritance tax
bill at that stage (assuming that both of you are domiciled in England and
Wales, or Scotland or Northern Ireland - not necessarily both in the same
one of these three countries).
The position for your house is a little different: it can be conveyed into
the names of your wife and yourself as tenants in common (in which case,
each of you can dispose of your respective half share by will, as you
please) or as joint tenants (in which case, the freehold will vest in the
survivor - unless either party in the meantime gives notice to the other of
severance of the joint tenancy).
Talk things over with your solicitor.
Transfers from joint names to the exclusive beneficial ownership of your
wife would be subject to the anti-avoidance legislation mentioned above
(primarily, section 674a of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988), but
really a transfer into her exclusive ownership is less vulnerable to attack
than a transfer into joint names.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Reducing CGT bill
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM A British citizen married to a French national and we own a house in
France. We lived there for six years until my employer transferred me and
the family to work in Italy, where we have lived in rented accommodation for
the past seven years. The French house was rented out, and still is, to a
third party.
Now my employer is transferring me to Britain and I wish to buy a house
there. Would I have to pay capital gains tax on the sale of the French
house? If so, is there any way to reduce or mitigate it?
It is probably not possible to mitigate the prospective CGT bill on the sale
of the French house. Write to the Inland Revenue Public Enquiry Room,
Somerset House, Strand, London, United Kingdom WC2R 1LB, for copies of the
free pamphlets CCT4 (Owner-occupied houses) and IR2O (Residents and
non-residents: liability to tax in the UK).

FT  12 DEC 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Advance tax: is it legal?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL THREE years ago, I would give my husband details of my income to
include on his tax return. Things are different now that I am taxed
separately. During the first year I paid in arrears, which my husband tells
me is how it should be. Tax for the second year was demanded on January 30.
This year, I received a tax demand in September to be paid on January 1.
My income consists mainly of basic retirement pension and untaxed interest
on Pounds 50,000 deposited with Barclays and re-invested at three-monthly
intervals.
Is it lawful to tax my income before I have received it all? Am I obliged to
pay our estimated tax demand?
Anticipatory assessments in respect of untaxed interest etc were authorised
by the 1988 Finance Act for 1988-89 onwards, so the inspector is right in
principle. After the end of the tax year, the assessment will adjusted
automatically to the right figure.
There is, however, a long-standing unpublished extra-statutory concession
under which a taxpayer may defer payment of tax from new year's day until
the day (between January 2 and April 5, inclusive) on which the item of
income in question arises.
In the circumstances, we suggest you write to the District Inspector
(marking both the letter and the envelope 'For the attention of the District
Inspector') asking him to ensure that the officer dealing with your
assessment is aware of this unpublished concession and gives you the benefit
of it.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A risky escape route - A couple
who bought an island complete with hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are running a successful London fashion business but are pushing 50
and thinking about a change, what do you do? Escape to an island, maybe.
That is what Tony and Beatrice Porter did eight years ago when they took the
biggest risk of their adventurous business lives by deciding to snap up a
chunk of near-deserted rock known as Burgh Island off the south Devon coast.
Its sole assets were a near-derelict 1930s hotel, and a shale-and-mortar
pub, the Pilchard Inn, built in 1336
Seven years and several million pounds later, the hotel has been refurbished
to reflect its original art decoratif splendour and has enjoyed a vigorous
trade, thanks to good timing, imaginative entrepreneurship, and the support
of several banks willing to back a long-shot.
The Porters first visited the village of Bigbury-on-Sea on a winter's day in
1985. One sight of the island, despite its parlous state, was enough: they
would become hoteliers. An added fillip, was that the hotel had a history:
Agatha Christie used it as the setting for two of her novels, And Then There
Were None and Evil Under the Sun.
Christie was close friends with the man who built the hotel, Archibald
Nettlefold, founder of what is now GKN. He also owned the Comedy Theatre in
London, which regularly staged Christie whodunnits. The hotel enjoyed
pre-war notoriety as a playground for Christie, Noel Coward, the young Louis
Mountbatten and even Edward and Mrs Simpson.
Ownership had long since passed from Nettlefold's hands; and on December 5
1985 it became the Porters', who bought it outright from Landstone Estates,
a small development company, before it was put up for auction.
The total outlay, including a two-year restoration, ran into millions, Tony
Porter recalled recently. Rewiring, for example, cost Pounds 50,000 and
roofing Pounds 60,000.
The motivation, Porter said, was to take on a new challenge, particularly as
Burgh Island came up for grabs just as his 50th birthday was approaching.
Porter spent most of the 1960s in Nigeria working for ICI; in the 1970s he
and his wife moved into London fashion consultancy.
'We could see that another 10-15 years would slip by with nothing really to
show for them but a pile of scrap books full of press cuttings promoting
other people's clothes,' he said.
Once the decision about Burgh Island was made, the challenge was to persuade
bank managers to go along with the plans, first with the bridging loan that
would allow them to clinch the deal while the sale of their London house
went through; the second to provide the long-term finance to restore the
property.
Help came from Allied Dunbar, which agreed to lend enough money to up the
deal before the auction. Contracts were exchanged on December 4 1985, and
'we completed the deal the following January 6, by which time all these
sales, our property in London and four small properties on the island, were
either completed or set up.'
A South Devon branch of Barclays Bank agreed to finance the refurbishment,
no easy task given the deterioration of the masonry, electrics, heating and
steel fittings, although the structure was sound. Much of the art deco
furniture had been damaged beyond repair or destroyed.
The hotel's self-catering flatlets were kept going while room-by-room
refurbishment got under way. The self-catering was gradually phased out and,
the hotel went back into full-time business on March 12, 1988, complete with
a scene out of a Coward play. 'Our first customers turned up in striped
blazers and beaded dresses, and the ballroom sprang to life with the
charleston and the tango.'
'We were advised that 28 bedrooms would be far more profitable than 14 suits
with their own sitting room,' said Porter, 'but were dedicated to style in
every area, and the suites suited that perfectly.
'Little by little, as we found more period furniture, more experienced staff
and marvellous food, we were able to inch up the tariff to the current level
of Pounds 85 per person per night, including breakfast, dinner, a suit and,
of course, VAT.
To the delight of Porter's bank managers, Burgh Island enjoys an occupancy
rate of 90 per cent in the five-month peak season and around 30 per cent in
the winter. The restaurant operates to a fashionable London standard and
attracts customers on its own. The hotel has a staff of 30 and is open all
year.
Porter acknowledge that it was not always smooth sailing. 'There were a
number of occasions when we worried about the wide gap between expenditures
and income on the project, and this kept us awake from time to time. But
with our occupancy rate now having climbed, we are confident we have turned
the corner. As well, our time and investment has enhanced the value of the
property as a whole.'
'The worst of the financial challenges behind us,' said Porter, 'there is no
reason why we should not persist in trying to create one of the best small
hotels anywhere.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / As They Say in Europe: Swiss role gives food for thought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS NOT often that Switzerland provides a top story; in fact, it is rare
even in Switzerland itself. But the referendum on the beautifully-named
European Economic Area, and its resulting No, became a two-day wonder.
As a result, the Swiss have now taken their place among that growing band of
European editors' unloved nations.
In neighbouring Bavaria, they had a good gloat. 'The economic crisis,
growing unemployment, the feeling that Switzerland's golden years are over,
all that provided fruitful soil for painting things black and false images
which all were directed towards to recipes of the past,' wrote the
Suddeutscher Zeitung.
Vienna's Die Presse feared that the Swiss result might mean increased
financial burdens for Austria, but more probably it would add to local
negative feelings about the EC. And, I can reveal, in Liechtenstein the
result has thrown domestic politics into total confusion.
French papers argued that the Maastricht treaty was to blame - it had proved
to be a calamity that probably would be underlined by this weekend's
Edinburgh summit, especially since the British would be running it. But,
noted La Tribune de l'Expansion in a rare moment of generosity, it was not
all Britain's fault.
For the first time in my lifetime, events in Switzerland have provoked
intellectual rumination on a matter of importance. And perhaps the country
has become interesting in its own right: German-speakers voted No, the
French Yes. So the francopohone Journal de Geneve wrote the word 'Nein' into
its headline.
A Lausanne paper said there would be a dramatic worsening of relations
between French and German speaking communities 'with possibly the ultimate
emergence of a better-structured and more dynamic French entity.'
The media have been coy in supplying reasons for the emergence of this new
(yet another) European fault line. The fact is that the francophone minority
quite likes the French. The German speakers cannot abide the Germans.
The possibility of an outright revolt by the francophones against the
majority group raises the spectre of Switzerland becoming another Belgium.
Oh dear - and I had been arguing how interesting it was.
But, as they say, one thing is clear: Europe is going wrong. All those bits
and pieces that made up the vision of a united Europe are disappearing from
sight.
The single market arrives without fanfare; European and monetary union are
no more than a distant dream to some and a fading nightmare to others.
The endless amendments to the Maastricht proposals that the so-called
Euro-sceptics are putting forward in the British parliament to scupper the
bill on European union are a waste of time: the Battle of Britain is over.
The paradoxes abound and the moves to create greater unity in Europe have
led to increased national friction and bitterness. The man in the street
becomes more and more confused: I heard someone talking about 'oilseed
subsidiarity' the other day.
Even readers of the Financial Times might think, at first glance, that this
is a real topic and, if an interviewer pressed a politician on it, the reply
would be comprehensive and lengthy.
The British want a referendum on the treaty and the union, which is odd
since they view it as Wonderland through the Looking Glass. I would sooner
vote on transubstantiation.
In a curious departure, le Figaro produced a perceptive and sensible
editorial on what forces were at work: 'To think that the Swiss have been
contaminated by the Maastricht syndrome] Like Denmark, which rejected the
treaty, and France, which gave it a narrow Yes, they have shown their
allergy to the dominant materialism.
'To the technocrats, notably those of Brussels, who argue that the Swiss
have snuffed out history, they have replied by expressing values impossible
to quantify because they come from the depths of ages past. The economic
arguments were incontestable. But it was the reasons of the heart that won.'
Here is the nub of the whole question: it was the Swiss, of all people, who
voted for raisons du coeur and against their economic interests. Even in the
canton of Zurich, the majority voted against a money-making enterprise. Can
gnomes turn in graves?
It is all part of the general move to Euro-atavism outlined here a couple of
weeks ago. As the Neue Zurcher Zeitung put it: 'In even stronger numbers
than in previous years the notably unfavourable economic conditions led to a
general rejection . . . however well-founded the proposal.'
It was talking about the other referendum in Zurich last Sunday when the
voters - for the fourth time since 1973 - defeated overwhelmingly a plan to
increase the car tax. The majority against was bigger than ever.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Avoiding a costly mistake - Planning
your Pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBBIE HARRISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DO you find a personal pension which is free of high commissions?
It is not always easy to distinguish between fees and commission. Many
advisers receive a combination of both while an increasingly common practice
is for fee chargers to accept 'integral fees' or 'fee compensation' from
product providers in lieu of commission when a sale is made. Any outstanding
commission is reinvested in your plan.
This avoids the 17.5 per cent VAT you would be charged if you paid the
adviser yourself but it has the disadvantage of linking the fee to the
product sale. Moreover, if you opt for fee compensation to avoid VAT, make
sure you know exactly what the adviser is getting. For example, if the
charge includes a percentage of the fund, it begins to look more and more
like commission and may cost you dear.
Under a typical personal pension, if commission is paid up front, it is
likely to account for 60 per cent of the first two year's contributions on a
regular premium plan. There are several types of low or non-commission
personal pensions, for example some of the self invested personal pensions
(Sipps) examined earlier in this series.
Non-commission plans:
The term non-commission is used to describe products where there is no
element of remuneration to the intermediary built in to the charging
structure. Two prominent 'non-commission' offices, Equitable Life and London
Life, do not sell through third parties but instead run direct sales forces
whose salaries are in part performance-related, so these products, strictly
speaking, are not commission free.
Due to the domination of commission-based advisers, non-commission pensions
have never really taken off and at present, unit-linked versions are only
offered by Professional Life and Provident Life. However, Provident Life
already operates a fee compensation system while Professional Life is
considering this method of payment.
To give an example of a non-commission charging structure, Professional
Life's personal pension has an establishment fee of Pounds 2.50 per month
for the first five years, an index-linked policy fee of Pounds 2 per month
throughout the term of the contract, and an annual management charge. The
latter starts at 0.75 per cent on the first Pounds 5,000 and reduces in
stages to 0.25 per cent on the whole of the fund where this is more than
Pounds 25,000.
Unit trust plans:
Only three unit trust groups offer a personal pension, namely Gartmore,
Fidelity, and Rothschild Asset Management (RAM). Unit trust personal
pensions offer a similar investment choice to life office unit-linked plans.
Under a unit trust plan, premiums go into a feeder fund and then are
directed to the funds of your choice.
The main difference between unit trust and unit-linked plans is in the
charging structure. Where life office charges can be difficult to decipher,
unit trust group charges by law must be explicit. Where unit trust groups
pay commission, this is normally around four to 5 per cent. In some cases,
even this can be discounted.
Gartmore, for example, has a 6 per cent bid / offer spread which includes 4
per cent commission. If the adviser forgoes the commission, this is
discounted, leaving an initial charge of just 2 per cent. Gartmore's annual
management charge is 1.5 per cent on most funds, reduced to 1.25 per cent on
bond funds and 0.75 per cent on deposit funds. There are no other charges,
no penalties for stopping and starting contributions and no switch fee.
Minimum contributions are Pounds 2,000 for single premiums, Pounds 500 for
additional single premiums and Pounds 100 per month for regular premiums.
Gartmore has just over Pounds 4m under management on its personal pension
plans.
The Rothschild Asset Management (RAM) plan has a 5 per cent bid offer spread
and 1 per cent annual management charge. There is no minimum premium level.
As with Gartmore's plan, there are no extra charges for switching or for
stopping and starting. RAM has Pounds 27.5m invested in its personal pension
funds.
Fidelity makes a one-off administration charge of 1.5 per cent on the first
contribution. The bid / offer spread is 5.25 per cent, apart from the cash
and the gilt and fixed interest funds, where there is no initial charge.
Annual management charges range from 0.5 per cent on the cash fund to 1.5
per cent on the equity growth fund. The minimum initial premium is Pounds
1,000 for a single contribution or Pounds 100 per month. Fidelity has Pounds
30m under management on its personal pension plan.
The choice of unit trust personal pensions is limited because most groups,
including M &amp; G, Save &amp; Prosper and Mercury, provide unit-linked plans
through their life arms. Midland Bank launched a successful unit trust
personal pension but switched to a unit-linked product after a couple of
years.
Alex Weiland, managing director of pooled pensions at Gartmore, says: 'The
majority of the unit trust groups prefer to use their life arms to launch
unit-linked plans because this gives them greater flexibility in terms of
charges. People should look carefully at the early termination penalties
that apply if you need to transfer out of a unit-linked plan or terminate
the plan early, perhaps because of redundancy. Moreover, life companies
frequently use such devices as capital units or reduced allocations in the
early years.'
Under a typical unit-linked plan, the first two years' premiums are invested
in capital or initial units. Capital units carry a higher annual charge than
standard or 'accumulation' units. In most cases, this charge continues to be
levied throughout the policy term.
The other main method of charging under a unit-linked plan mentioned by
Weiland is through reduced allocation rates. This means that only a
percentage of your premiums actually reach your investment fund - the rest
is swallowed up by the life office.
A third catch with some unit-linked plans is double charging on in-house
unit trusts. In other words, you pay the usual initial charge of around 5
per cent on the feeder fund and then the same charge is imposed a second
time when the feeder fund directs your money to the underlying unit trust.
Unit trust personal pension regulations prevent double charging.
Investment Trusts:
As yet, there are no investment trusts operating as personal pension
providers. However, you can invest directly in investment trusts through a
Sipp or indirectly through unit-linked plans. Skandia's personal pension
offers access to the Foreign &amp; Colonial Investment Trust and to Fleming's
managed fund of investment trusts. Equitable Life's pension also offers a
link with a managed fund of investment trusts.
Commission reinvested:
Mainstream personal pensions can be available on a non-commission or
low-commission basis. This is often arranged on a fee basis with the adviser
but should not be confused with the execution-only services offered by some
pension firms. Insurance companies will not negotiate non-commission terms
directly with the public.
One problem with commission reinvestment is that advisers are prevented from
showing the impact of non-commission terms in their projection analyses. Ian
McKenna, partner with independent advisers McKenna &amp; Co, said: 'The life
offices have constructed this system with Lautro (the life office regulator)
so as to make it virtually impossible for independent advisers to provide
valid examples of the impact of enhanced terms on the final payout.'
Jim Roberts, general manager of Professional Life, said: 'Thanks to the
ridiculous standardised illustrations basis that Lautro / SIB force the
market to operate under, all products look the same.' Roberts warned that,
even where initial commission has been reinvested, the provider often leaves
in place the early surrender and transfer penalties. It is worth checking
this point with your adviser. You should also ask what will happen to
renewal and incremental commission.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors' buying in Rhino Group (formerly JMD), the home entertainment and
video games company, was highlighted back in October when directors bought
stock in the open offer and placing. The shares have performed strongly
since and the most recent purchase is worth more than Pounds 100,000.
Two directors - Anthony Solomons, chairman, and Archibald Walker, a
non-executive - have bought stock in Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant
bank. Neither owned shares in the group prior to these transactions.
In Ewart, the property company, the sale by Philip Monahan coincided with
his resignation from the board. Monahan's board seat was on behalf of
Monarch Properties which expressed an interest in Ewart earlier this year.
The sale of almost 30 per cent in Ewart was made to Pattenhead Establishment
at a premium of more than 22p to the market price. Pattenhead says its
interests are friendly.
Interim results from Allen reflect the difficulties endured by the
contracting and construction sector. But directors were buying in September
and recently the chairman and managing director bought shares.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Stock dividends; a smart option? / A
look at potential costs for those tempted to take bonus shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHAREHOLDERS in public companies are more and more frequently being given
the opportunity to take their dividends in bonus shares rather than cash.
Opting for shares will certainly help the company's coffers but the
advantages for the individual shareholder are rather more questionable.
The practice of offering 'stock dividends' was popular in the 1960s and
early 1970s when dividend income was taxable at rates of up to 98 per cent.
The attraction of stock dividends was that they escaped income tax and were
subject only to capital gains tax on disposal - but this loophole was closed
in 1975.
There will rarely now be a tax incentive for shareholders to take shares
rather than cash and they may be worse off. The pros and cons can best be
understood in the context of the treatment of cash dividends.
When a company declares a cash dividend, it has to pay advance corporation
tax at one-third the amount of the dividend. The shareholder then pays
income tax on the aggregate of the dividend and the ACT but gets a tax
credit equal to the amount of ACT paid.
Take the case of a higher-rate taxpayer who receives a Pounds 75 dividend.
The company must pay ACT of Pounds 25 and the shareholder will be taxed on
Pounds 100. His basic rate charge will be wiped out by the Pounds 25 tax
credit, leaving him liable only to higher rate tax of Pounds 15.
Suppose, instead, that our shareholder opts for shares worth Pounds 75. The
ACT rules apply only to cash dividends but stock dividend legislation
provides for the share value to be grossed up at the basic rate of tax so
the effect is the same as ACT on cash dividends.
The recipient of the shares is therefore taxed on income of Pounds 100.
There is no ACT-linked credit; instead, the legislation gives a specific
dispensation from basic rate tax.
So the net outcome for a 40 per cent taxpayer will be exactly the same as if
he had taken the money - a tax liability of Pounds 15 on a benefit of Pounds
75.
This is on the assumption that the tax charge will be based on the amount of
the cash dividend foregone. But if, by the time the shares are issued, their
market value is 'substantially' higher or lower than the cash equivalent -
interpreted by the Inland Revenue as 15 per cent either way - the relevant
figure will be the actual market value.
This rule had a harsh impact on those who stampeded to take up stock
dividends in the final throes of the 1987 bull market. Shares issued in
those heady days often raced over the 15 per cent upper threshold but, after
the Black Monday crash, were worth far less than the cash dividends that had
been on offer. Shareholders ended up with the worst of both worlds - a
smaller benefit and a larger tax bill.
Market volatility can work both ways. But the salutary experience of
investors in 1987 does highlight the fact that stock dividends are 'dry'
income - triggering a tax liability but no liquidity with which to settle
it.
The absence of ACT on stock dividends is a clear advantage for companies,
particularly for the growing number which do not have sufficient UK profits
to absorb all the ACT which they pay. There is also an advantage in issuing
more paper rather than having to part with hard cash.
For shareholders the only tangible advantage is that it is a cheaper way of
acquiring shares than buying them on the market, avoiding brokers'
commission and 0.5 per cent stamp duty. Furthermore, the entry price will
usually be the middle quotation for the stock rather than the higher 'offer'
price on a market purchase.
For non-taxpayers there is a serious drawback. A stock dividend means no ACT
and therefore no tax credit. This makes no difference to taxpayers; the
specific exemption from basic rate tax on stock dividends has exactly the
same effect as the tax credit. For a non-taxpayer, this exemption has no
value.
A non-taxpayer receiving a Pounds 75 cash dividend would not only be exempt
from tax but could also claim a Pounds 25 rebate from the Revenue. But if he
elected for a stock dividend, his right to a repayment would disappear. This
applies to anyone outside the income tax net - children and other low-income
individuals and also tax-exempt institutions such as pension funds and
charities.
For those who remain undeterred, the worst shock may come when they sell the
shares. The capital gains tax rules for stock dividends are labyrinthine. If
the CGT liability itself does not eliminate any benefit from taking shares
rather than cash, the extra fees payable to your accountant for undertaking
the calculation almost certainly will.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: With-profits bonus threat - Norwich
Union's signal to the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO DISQUIETING signals for with-profits bonuses were hoisted this week.
Norwich Union made it clear that it intended to cut 'annual' or reversionary
bonuses next year (a full announcement will wait until next month).
And the international credit-rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's, in its first
report* on the financial strength of UK life offices, said that overall
strength had declined over the last five years, and that a permanent decline
in solvency standards was likely.
It even branded four life offices - Guardian Assurance, National Provident
Insitution, Prolific, and Windsor Life as 'vulnerable'. All the offices
concerned fiercely rebutted this.
NU's comments concern its 'with-profits' policies. These are the standard
endowments used to back mortgages and guarantee a 'sum assured' to investors
when they start saving (usually slightly less than the amount invested), and
add on investment profits in the form of bonuses.
These come in two forms - reversionary bonuses, which are declared each year
and then cannot be taken away, and additional or terminal bonuses, which are
only added when the policy matures.
Reversionary bonuses need to be supported by gilts and other fixed interest
securities, so life offices tend to concentrate policy returns on terminal
bonuses. This gives them more investment freedom.
But that means less security for investors. Terminal bonuses can be slashed
in a moment.
Last year, NU cut its terminal bonuses, to reflect the bad market
performance of 1990, when the FT-SE fell for the year, and the mediocre
performance of 1991. Others followed its lead. Terminal bonus cuts could
easily be reversed for future generations of policyholders if the market
picks up. Cuts to reversionary bonus would have less immediate effect, but
the longer term implications are more serious.
Philip Scott, NU's investment manager, says that cuts in reversionary bonus
across the industry are inevitable, thanks to the double whammy of lower
returns from investment performance, and the demands of maintaining
financial strength.
NU predicts that nominal investment returns on all classes of assets will be
consistently lower in the 1990s than they were in the 1980s. That means that
if reversionary bonuses are not cut now, terminal bonuses will have to be
cut by a proportionately greater amount in the following years. So
reversionary bonuses would account for a greater share of endowment total
pay-outs.
As they are funded by fixed interest securities, this would weaken
endowments' competitiveness as a product. They would be more secure, but
they could not compete as a strong capital growth investment, as they do
now, with more flexible equity driven unit-linked products.
Life offices also have their financial strength to consider. The government
strictly monitors their solvency, or in other words the ability to meet
their obligations to policyholders. That strength has been affected by
falling property and equity values in the last two years, which reduced the
level of life insurers' reserves.
The extra distribution expenses which many life offices shouldered after the
Financial Services Act of 1986, as they raised commissions and established
ties with building societies, also ate into reserves.
Standard &amp; Poor's says that companies committed to maintaining financial
strength will continue to reduce bonus levels. This finding, coupled with
the weakening seen across the industry, looks alarming for returns on
policies.
One of the least painful ways for offices to ease this kind of strain is to
cut reversionary bonuses - terminal bonuses are not a commitment to
policyholders, but reversionary bonuses, once they have been announced, have
to be supported.
Scott also says that, for the life industry as a whole, 10-year pay-outs are
around 20 per cent more than their share of the assets in the fund in which
they are invested. In other words, the offices are digging into their
reserves to pay for the maturity values.
This cannot be sustained, and so Scott predicts pay-outs will be trimmed
back over the next three years, so that maturity values pay for themselves
by 1995. That means 10-year pay-outs for Pounds 50 per month policies
falling from their current average of just under Pounds 12,000 to a level
around Pounds 9,000.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Braced for the storm / A look at
weather-related insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RAIN and violent storms have caused a great deal of damage in recent weeks
and insurance companies are bracing themselves for a rise in weather-related
claims.
Householders should check the extent of their policy cover and take
preventative action in the home to minimise the need to make a claim.
Burst pipes are the most common cause of weather-related damage. Since
building and contents are likely to be affected it is important to be
covered for both.
Damage to roofs, windows, doors and walls falls under a buildings insurance
policy, while damage to carpets and furniture is covered under a contents
policy. Donald Malcolm, of General Accident, says that fitted units, tiles
and wallpaper are also considered part of the building. Repair to pipes
burst because of freezing weather usually will not be covered, according to
Swinton Insurance brokers.
The insurance companies all stress prevention when it comes to winter. 'Act
as if you did not have insurance and be prudent,' says Steve Turner, of Sun
Alliance. He advises people to lag cold and hot water pipes and to clear
gutters and drains to prevent damage during a thaw. Check the roof for loose
slates or tiles. Noel Privett, of AA Insurance, suggests opening the loft
door to let warm air into the roof cavity when the weather turns very cold,
since that is where pipes and water tanks are at their most vulnerable, and
to keep on the heating at night.
If you are going away, you should turn off the water supply and drain the
hot and cold water system. Alternatively, you could keep the heating on low
while you are away. Turner says the worst thing is to turn the heating off
while leaving water in the pipes.
A prudent measure is to leave keys with someone in case of an emergency. If
a pipe has burst, the water must be turned off immediately, so make sure
that whoever comes around knows where the stopcock is. Remember that if you
go away for more than 30 days, your policy is unlikely to cover you at all.
There can be confusion when it comes to cover for items outside the house.
Garden furniture is usually covered under a contents policy but, if it is
damaged by bad weather, you will find it hard to find an insurer willing to
pick up the tab. Garden furniture should be stored either inside the home or
in a shed. If a storm blows off the shed roof the stored garden furniture
would be covered under your contents policy and the shed under buildings.
Some restrictions, on paths, fances and gates for example, can bemuse
policyholders. Most insurers will not cover damage to fences or gates
because of a storm or flood. Some insurers, for example AA, will pay for
damage to fences and gates caused by a falling tree but many policies will
not do this if the tree fell as a result of a storm. Damage caused by a
falling tree (for whatever reason) will be covered by Sun Alliance if it
fell on to a wall but not if it fell on gates or fences.
Your insurance company will not pay to clear away a tree which has fallen
unless it causes damage.
Make sure that both buildings and contents are insured for their full value
 -if a pipe were to burst in the roof causing torrents of water to cascade
through the house, remember that the payout on an individual item will be
restricted. You should have the item specified or see if your insurer will
agree to increase the single item limit. The standard excess on most
buildings policies is Pounds 50.
If a pipe freezes, the Association of British Insurers recommends that you
turn off the main stop valve and thaw the pipe with hot water bottles or a
thick cloth soaked in hot water. You should start at the end of the pipe
nearest the tank.
If the pipe has already burst, you should once again turn off the main stop
valve. If you cannot stop the flow, open all cold water taps to drain the
system but do not open the hot taps as the hot water cylinder could collapse
if the pipes feeding it are frozen. You should also turn off the central
heating.
Before contacting a plumber, the ABI recommends contacting the insurance
company immediately to see if they have preferred contractors, which will
save you the bother of collecting different estimates for the damage. Some
insurers also have emergency helplines.
If you are flooded, you should switch off electricity at the mains and move
as many belongings as possible upstairs. The ABI recommends leaving windows
and doors open to allow air to circulate. Furniture should be pulled away
from the walls.
Swinton Insurance says you should keep damaged items to show a loss
assessor, in case the insurance company decides to appoint one to look at
the damage.
Since you will probably need to claim both contents and buildings insurance,
having these policies with one insurer simplifies the claims process and you
will only need to submit one claim.
However, it could be a while before you can redecorate and get life back to
normal again. Walls should be treated with anti-mould solution and
floorboards should be given six months to dry out. Many insurance companies
will contribute to the costs of drying out and should pay for a short period
of temporary accommodation if the property has been made uninhabitable.
Prevention is not only in the insurer's interest: averting a disaster means
much less hassle for the homeowner, too.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ASDA, the grocery chain, announces its interim results on Friday and is
forecast to increase pre-tax profits from Pounds 10.1m to between Pounds 30m
and Pounds 40m, with most estimates around the Pounds 35m mark.
Analysts expect the improvement to be due to the reduction in debt and
increase in interest receivable due to Asda's Pounds 350m rights issue last
year, rather than an uplift in trading. The operating profit is expected to
be little changed. The considerable efforts of the new management team, led
by Archie Norman, will take a while longer to pay off.
HP Bulmer Holdings, the premium cider and drinks group, is set for a 20 per
cent jump in pre-tax profits in the six months to October 31. Analysts put
interim profits at about Pounds 10.7m compared with Pounds 9.07m last year,
with the dividend likely to be increased 10 per cent to 3.8p (3.45p).
Devenish, the West Country pub retailer, is expected to report a 16 per cent
rise in full year pre-tax profits to Pounds 13.3m on Thursday. Pubs suffered
from poor tourist trade in the first half but the second half has been
helped by acquisitions.
Tiphook, trailer and container rental group, is expected to report on Monday
a decline in interim pre-tax profits to Pounds 35m from Pounds 39.2m. Slower
economies across Europe have taken their toll but the group is likely to
lift its dividend by about 10 per cent from 4.4p a share a year earlier.
Southern Electric is reporting its delayed interim figures on Tuesday. It
had postponed them until after its chairman had testified to the House of
Commons on coal. Its pre-tax profits are likely to rise by about 30 per cent
to around Pounds 18m, a bigger rise than achieved by some of the other
regional electricity companies.
Daily Mail and General Trust should unveil on Wednesday a modest increase in
full-year profits to around Pounds 50m from Pounds 47.7m. Advertising
markets have been weak.
Electronic Data Processing, the computer services supplier, is expected to
report on Monday full-year profits of about Pounds 4.8m, up from Pounds 4.1m
a year earlier. It had a good first half with profits rising 30 per cent to
Pounds 2.4m but trading slowed sharply in the second half.
Ferranti International, the electronics group brought to its knees by its
disastrous acquisition of ISC in the US, reports interim results on Tuesday.
The market is looking for further rehabilitation under the new leadership of
Eugene Anderson.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Advert for bond irks advisers - A
complicated product from Scottish Widows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVISERS this week rushed to complain about an advertisement from Scottish
Widows which they believe to be misleading.
The product which aroused their ire is the Scottish Widows Monthly Bond. In
spite of its name, the bond is not a single insurance policy, but a
complicated financial product.
It is a 'back-to-back investment' in which part of the capital sum goes into
a temporary annuity, and the remainder into a Pep which attempts to grow
enough to replace the capital lost in the annuity.
The aim is to get a high income, while taking steps to limit the danger of
capital loss. A Pep might grow considerably over the years - but it might
not, and there is no guarantee that it will go up rather than down.
This is why the Widows' slogan 'Up to 9.20 per cent net of basic rate tax
fixed for five years' could be misleading. The income from the annuity is
fixed, but there is nothing fixed about the Pep. The use of a 'fixed' figure
for interest implies the capital stays constant, and there is nothing in
Scottish Widows' advertising to say otherwise, or even a mention that the
bulk of the investment goes into a Pep.
The warning is given in much smaller letters at the bottom of the
advertisement: 'The value of stockmarket investments may fall as well as
rise and investors may not get back the full amount originally invested'.
A letter sent to clients by the independent intermediary RJ Temple also
quotes the 9.2 per cent return, and then adds: 'The Monthly Bond aims to
return your original investment in full at the end of five years - totally
tax-free. Of course, the growth rate cannot be guaranteed and you may get
back more or less than the sum you invested, according to the performance
achieved. However, with Scottish Widows, you can rest assured that your
money will be in very experienced and capable hands indeed.'
John Spiers, of BESt Investment, would have gone into rather greater detail.
He said: 'In order for a full return of capital to be obtained the assets in
the trust must grow at 13 per cent per annum. This is much greater than that
achieved by most equity funds over the past five years.'
Another adviser has taken a similar view, and has made a complaint to
Lautro. By his calculations, if the yield on the UK High Income unit trust,
which backs the Pep, is maintained, annual capital growth of 8.3 per cent
will be needed to return the capital in full.
Assuming an average annual total return of 8.5 per cent (the lower rate
prescribed by Imro, the investment managers' regulator), then an initial
investment of Pounds 4,932 would drop to Pounds 4,016, and a Pounds 9,864
investment would drop to Pounds 8,032 at the end of five years - a drop of
22.8 per cent. If the Pep failed to grow at all, the capital loss would be
40 per cent; and the Pep could fall in value.
David Graham, of Scottish Widows unit trusts, admits that the 13 per cent
growth rate required is 'slightly optimistic' - not a judgment contained
anywhere in the literature - but said that over each five-year period from
1974 to 1991 (but not 1987-92), it would have been achieved. He also said
further projections of Pep performance would be sent to customers during the
'cooling-off period', and investors could withdraw then.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Equities beat the doom and gloom / A
look at the shares which are the year's leaders and laggards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUY when the besieging army is at the city gates; sell when the trumpets
sound the retreat. The old Rothschild adage once more proved its usefulness
in 1992.
Faced with daily headlines of economic gloom, the small investor might
easily have been baffled by the stock market's cheerfulness. As the FT-SE
100 Index reached a new high (2,792 on December 1), one reader wrote: 'If
the FT-SE was near its all-time low, I could understand the situation rather
than the present one.'
But stock markets are continually looking ahead and the problems of today
are frequently seen as far less important than the hopes for tomorrow.
In fact, there were three distinct market phases during the year;
post-election euphoria as investors celebrated the Conservatives' unexpected
victory at the polls; the summer of depression as the long-awaited UK
economic recovery failed to arrive; and the aftermath of Black Wednesday as
traders responded to the interest rate cuts which followed the UK's
departure from the exchange rate mechanism.
Overall, the FT-SE 100 Index rose 10.3 per cent over the year to December 9,
while the FT-A All-Share Index climbed 10 per cent over the same period. Add
in a yield of four to five per cent and, even allowing for costs, an equity
investor should easily have beaten building society returns.
But as usual, the leaders and laggards lists for 1992 show how carefully
investors have to pick and choose their stocks. We have divided the lists
into two groups (compiled from Datastream), showing the best and worst
performers in the Footsie and among all stocks.
We have eliminated one category; those companies which have gone bust.
Obviously, investors in such companies have lost 100 per cent of their
money; we have included only those shares where the company retains a quote.
The top performing Footsie share of the year was the HongKong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation which took the place of its new subsidiary, Midland
Bank, in the index.
Indeed, it was a good year for bank shares, with the FT-A Banks index rising
by more than a third - news which is unlikely to make the banks any more
popular with those who accuse them of profiting from the recession.
Granada chief executive Gerry Robinson will be entitled to smile at his
group's second place in the rankings. Dismissed as an 'upstart caterer' by
John Cleese when he took over the TV and leisure group, Robinson recently
announced more than doubled pre-tax profits.
Among the Footsie losers, BET, a business services company, last month
announced a 43 per cent drop in interim pre-tax profits and made it clear
that this year's dividend is unlikely to be covered by earnings.
During the year, the company raised Pounds 200m via a rights issue to repay
debt; those who took up the rights at 110p would have been disappointed to
see the shares languishing at 83p at the close on Thursday.
The FT-SE 100 Index is a harsh taskmaster and BET's decline means it will
drop out of the index at the end of the year, along with Rolls-Royce. Royal
Insurance and Standard Chartered will take their places.
Rolls is one of three former privatisation stocks in the bottom ten, making
it a distinctly mixed year for Sid, the government's favourite private
investor.
Sid did well if he stuck to the privatised utilities - there are two water
companies and BAA in the top ten - but far less well with the industrial
groups.
BP cut its dividend for the first time since the first world war and
announced plans for 11,500 job cuts in a turbulent year which also saw the
departure of Robert Horton, its chairman and chief executive.
The news was even worse at British Steel, which omitted its interim dividend
altogether as it announced a pre-tax loss for the first half - a reminder of
the bad old pre-privatisation days when its losses made the Guinness Book of
Records.
The shares were trading at 55p this week, compared with the fully-paid
flotation price of 125p. Indeed, British Steel achieved, along with oil
group Lasmo, the unenviable distinction of being in the Footsie laggards'
list two years running.
It was a pretty bad year for contrarian investment. If you had bought a
portfolio of 1991's ten leading Footsie stocks, you would have made a gain
of 8.8 per cent this year; buying 1991's losers would have earned you a loss
of 6.7 per cent.
There were some exceptions. Supermarket group Asda, the worst performing
Footsie stock of 1991 (it was then relegated from the index) showed signs of
recovery and its shares have risen by over 50 per cent in 1992.
Guardian Royal Exchange, in the FT-SE loser list of 1991, rebounded this
year on reduced losses, although the news for shareholders was not entirely
good; the interim dividend was cut from 4.4p to 2.5p.
The share which is top of the small stocks list - Tanjong - is an oddity. A
former tin dredging company, it acquired Pan Malaysian Pools, a lottery
operator, in 1991 and also manages the National Stud Farm.
But whether any UK investors enjoyed the benefit of the rise recorded by
Datastream seems doubtful. Tanjong fits the definition of a close company
(controlled by five or fewer persons): some 90 per cent of its shareholders
reside outside the UK and the shares have only been traded on a matched
bargain basis since April.
So, realistically, the share which performed best for UK investors in 1992
was TVS Entertainment. This does represent a triumph of contrarian thinking;
the company lost its franchise last year and was sixth in 1991's losers'
list, recording a fall of 90.1 per cent (it was one of the losers of 1989 as
well).
Investors' prayers were answered this year by the arrival of Reverend Pat
Robertson, former US Presidential candidate and purveyor of wholesome TV
though his company, International Family Entertainment.
However, the cash element of the offer - 23p per share - means that many
investors will be nursing heavy losses; TVS shares reached a peak of 454p in
1987.
Family entertainment is also on offer from two more of this year's leaders;
Bluebird Toys, maker of the Polly Pocket doll and the Big Red Fun Bus, which
returned to profit; and it was an annus mirabilis for shareholders in Sleepy
Kids, the cartoon group which has bought the intellectual property rights to
Budgie the helicopter, the character created by the Duchess of York.
A wave of nostalgia will doubtless greet the inclusion of Filofax in the
leaders list; the personal organiser group, which was close to collapse in
1990, has been revived by one of the breeds which flourished in the 1980s, a
management consultant.
The losers among the small companies are a mixture of marketing groups,
property companies and leisure stocks. The name that does stand out is Pepe
group, the jeans design and marketing company.
If the economy recovers in 1993, so might some of the stocks which have
suffered most this year. But not necessarily.
Past experience has shown that the early stages of recovery are very
dangerous for weakened companies; creditors may take the opportunity to
foreclose once they can find a buyer for the assets.
Equity investment may well be profitable in 1993, but it will be far from
easy.

Hoare Govett raised Pounds 28m for its investment trust linked to its
smaller companies index, but only Pounds 500,000 of that came through the
public offer, a sign that private investors are yet to be convinced that the
small companies revival is due. Nevetheless, it was another good week for
small company shares. The County index rose 0.3 per cent from 866.01 to
868.43 over the seven days to December 10; the Hoare Govett index (capital
gains version) also jumped 0.3 per cent from 1122.54 to 1126.07 over the
same period.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: BES from Close Brothers - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Close Brothers has launched a BES scheme, BESSA CARE, which allows a
non-recourse loan after six months or 12months. This means top-rate
taxpayers effectively pay 60p after tax, and receive 72p after six months,
and 76p after 12months. The loans are provided by the Bank of Ireland. The
company will buy two nursing homes for Associated Nursing Services. However,
John Spiers, of BESt Investment points out that the return for investors
after five years is low - Pounds 1.10 1/2 p for every Pounds 1 spent before
tax - and so suggests it should only be taken up by those who wish to take
the early loan. The scheme is unsuitable for basic rate taxpayers.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Oil prices hit their lowest since
March - At a glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL prices hit their lowest point since March, when the price of North Sea
Brent crude for January delivery slipped by 30 cents to Dollars 17.70 a
barrel on Wednesday.
The crude oil price is being dragged downwards by continued weakness in the
price of products such as gasoil and fuel oil. The mild winter and the
recession in both North America and Britain has weakened demand for these
products.
The falls in price come despite an agreement last month by Opec member
states to cut production to 24.58m barrels a day from 25m b/d. The ceiling
does not include a production level for Ecuador which has left Opec.
The chart shows the volatile performance of oil since the beginning of 1991
before the outbreak of the Gulf War.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Markets: Tiny prepares to walk into the sunset - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a week for fairytales to end. Some, as all good stories do, ended
with a happy ever after. Others did not.
The poor youth who found fabulous riches and came to rule an empire has, at
last, chosen an heir and is even now painting a sunset into which he can
walk. Called Tiny, but not by any means an eighth dwarf (and, if fairytales
are to be believed, once a railway porter), Roland Rowland is not, however,
quite the unblemished hero of pantomime for all his expense accounts and
corporate jets.
He will never live down being called 'the unacceptable face of capitalism'
in 1973 by Edward Heath, then prime minister. And his planned exit from
Lonrho is as convoluted as his business empire.
Had the likes of the Prudential still been shareholders in Lonrho, he could
expect a rough ride from the institutions on the terms of the deal. Rowland
is selling his shares to Dieter Bock, a German financier, for 115p while
Lonrho is selling shares to the same man at 85p. Rowland was quoted this
week saying that he regarded Bock almost as a son.
Why Rowland's shares are worth 30p more than new ones issued by Lonrho is
hard to see, but the effect is that the shareholders - for the company is
the embodiment of its shareholders - are getting less for selling shares
than Tiny is.
The fact that, as individuals, they also can buy shares at 85p is little
comfort; even if they take up their rights, they will be diluted because the
company would then issue yet more shares to Bock.
As it is, Rowland may well get away with no more than a 'boo, hiss' from the
audience as he heads for happy-ever-after land.
Meanwhile, in another part of the forest - Brentwood, in Essex - Alan
Sugar's fairytale was ending this week, too, but not quite so happily for
the principal character.
Here, the Prudential was still a shareholder and, with others, refused to
accept a 30p a share offer from Sugar to buy back Amstrad, the consumer
electronics group he had founded.
Sugar's proposition was that Amstrad's problems were so bad that the company
had to be shrunk. It would, he claimed, be better to do this as a private
rather than public company. So, he offered to buy the 65 per cent of the
shares he did not own for 30p each.
Amstrad shareholders are nothing if not suspicious, though, especially when
confronted with an offer without any independent advice or forecasts about
the future profitability of the business. If this was a good deal for Sugar,
it must be bad for them; and if it was not a good deal for Sugar, why was he
doing it?
Since Sugar has for so long played up his role as the unsmiling pantomime
villain, no one would believe that he had been transformed suddenly into a
fairy godmother. His offer was rejected.
Now, he must struggle on in the public domain, either to prove himself right
and suffer a fall in the value of his investment in the company, or to be
wrong and make a second fortune.
The fairytale of 6 per cent base rates by Christmas also has ended. As the
chart shows, UK interest rates have dipped below German rates for the first
time since 1981 - a year when sterling fell from over DM 5 to little more
than DM 4.
There is an important difference between then and now; the UK inflation rate
announced yesterday was below the German rate for the first time in decades.
Even so, barring another sterling devaluation of that magnitude, history
would suggest that UK interest rates cannot fall further until German rates
do. Fortunately - for the UK - Germany appears to be moving rapidly into
recession, making a fall in rates there likely in the new year.
So, although the stock market was unsettled this week by the realisation
that an immediate fall in base rates had been ruled out, and the FT-SE 100
index fell 43.2 points to 2,716.2 over the week, there is still something to
look forward to after Christmas.
Nick Knight, the investment guru at Nomura Research Institute - who was on
Black Wednesday touched by a magic wand and transformed from a bear to a
bull - has calculated that in 21 of the past 27 years, the stock market has
risen during the three-week Christmas account. The average rise, including
the down years, is 2.23 per cent.
Since the market generally has a run in the first three weeks of January,
too - in 20 of the past 27 years, with an average rise of 2.53 per cent -
Knight concludes there is a good chance of a near-5 per cent rise in the
market in the next six weeks.
But Knight does not stop there. He forecasts the FT-SE 100 index will reach
3,500 by the end of 1993. This is well above most equity strategist's
forecasts of about 2,800 to 3,000.
His main point is that UK corporate earnings will rise sharply next year -
by as much as 30 per cent - and the year after as recovery comes through,
unit costs are lower, and the lower pound helps on translating overseas
profits.
Others have much less optimistic views on corporate earnings growth in 1993,
picking numbers around 15 per cent, and believe that the stock market is
already discounting that rise.
What is more, as far as the UK market is concerned, the prospect of the
government selling Pounds 1bn worth of gilt-edged stock a week from April
onwards will soak up much of the institutions' cash and drive up gilt
yields, putting a damper on equities.
While the UK may be on the verge of recovery - unless it is yet another
false dawn - Europe appears to be slowing down fast.
That certainly was the message from the Guinness share price this week when
the market realised that its profits could fall this year because of the
cooler European economic climate. Guinness dropped 47p to 478p over the
week.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Markets: Softly, softly approach wins the day - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE weeks after he was elected, Bill Clinton this week finally announced
the top economic appointments for his first administration. The reaction of
the financial markets, which in the immediate aftermath of the election had
been consumed with speculation about who would make the president-elect's
first team, was predictable - they ignored it.
With good reason, for the news was hardly new. All the big appointments  -
Senator Lloyd Bentsen as treasury secretary, representative Leon Panetta as
head of the budget office, and investment bankers Robert Rubin and Roger
Altman as chief White House economic adviser and deputy treasury secretary,
respectively - had been telegraphed well in advance, leaving the markets
plenty of time to price their reaction into stocks and bonds before the
formal announcements were made.
This is probably exactly what the Clinton camp wanted. The gradual leaking
of the top appointments seemed a deliberate policy to avoid frightening Wall
Street.
The game he has played over the past five weeks shows that the
president-elect and his advisers have realised the importance of winning the
confidence of the markets.
The US has not had a new Democratic president in 16 years so, for many
people in the business and financial world, the arrival of Bill Clinton in
the White House will be a step into the unknown.
Fortunately, the president-elect seems to have chosen wisely, at least in
terms of whether the appointees would command the respect of the markets.
All the big names are pragmatic veterans of either Capitol Hill or Wall
Street, essentially conservative Democrats who are unlikely to push for
excessively Keynesian, growth-oriented economic policies of the type that so
worried the bond market during the final stages of the election campaign.
Fortunately for president-elect Clinton, signs that the pace of the economic
recovery has been quickening over the past few months have allowed him and
his advisers to soften their stance on economic policy.
If treasury investors feared that tough talk from Democrats on the campaign
trail about spending their way out of recovery would translate into an
inflation-fuelling package of fiscal stimuli, those fears have been partly
assuaged by both the evidence of renewed economic growth and Thursday's
political appointments.
While much attention over the past month was focused on the composition of
the first Clinton administration, the stock markets were quietly building up
a considerable head of steam.
Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average has never threatened its high, the
blue-chip index has gained almost six per cent since hitting a low in early
October.
Over a similar period, secondary indices have been busy setting new records
amid exceptionally busy trading, with the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 and the
Nasdaq composite setting near or actual double-digit gains.
The market's mini-rally, however, may have now run its course. Although the
losses of the last two days represent only a minor setback in percentage
terms, sentiment seems to have shifted.
The advances of the past month or so stemmed primarily from investors
selectively searching for cheap or growth stocks. It has been what analysts
like to call a 'stock-pickers market', with considerable variations in
demand within industry groups. The choicest bargains have been snapped up,
leaving only the expensive or distressed stocks for the stragglers. The lack
of a truly market-wide rush into equities explains why the Dow has lagged
the other indices.
The market as a whole is beginning to look fully, if not over-priced. Wall
Street securities house Salomon Brothers notes that the S&amp;P's 500 is
currently trading at 16.9 times estimated 1993 earnings, and is yielding a
meagre three per cent based on dividend forecasts. Consequently, Salomon's
chief equity strategist, David Shulman, envisages only modest returns for
equity investors in 1993.
IBM had another bad week, even if some market watchers believe the selling
of the stock has been overdone. Predictions from a couple of analysts of
further restructuring moves that could endanger the dividend, and reports
that the company was about to call an unusual board meeting, took their toll
of IBM mid-week.
The news that Standard &amp; Poor's is considering lowering its ratings on some
IBM debt did not help either, and in four days of trading, the share price
dropped another 7.5 per cent to below Dollars 62.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Markets: Lonrho and Bock; it's best to wait and see - The
Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE has been one thing learnt by Lonrho shareholders over the years, it
is never to be surprised. But this week's news that chief executive Tiny
Rowland - who has, effectively, run the company for 31 years - was selling
his stake to a German financier must have raised a few eyebrows.
As one UK institutional shareholder explained: 'We do not approve of the
deal with Dieter Bock. But . . . we have been in the dark about what is
happening at Lonrho for some time.'
Shareholders would love to get their hands on the financial information  -
not in the public domain - that Bock's adviser, Morgan Grenfell, extracted
from Lonrho. As a result, he is to underwrite half the 200m shares in the
3-for-10 rights issue at 85p a share; take up the rights of chief executive
Tiny Rowland; and buy half Rowland's 15 per cent stake at 115p a share.
Earlier this year, a number of shareholders asked for meetings with Lonrho
after it unexpectedly reduced 1991's final dividend by 3p to 5p - the first
cut in a decade. According to two institutional shareholders, there were
'frank exchanges.' In the end, it was agreed that Phillips &amp; Drew
Securities, then Lonrho's joint broker, would act as a conduit between the
company and shareholders.
That arrangement broke down when Phillips &amp; Drew found it was equally in the
dark. This happened when Lonrho, without prior warning, sold a one-third
stake in the UK-based Metropole Hotels for Pounds 177.5m to the Libyan
government. Phillips &amp; Drew resigned, leaving Societe Generale Strauss
Turnball, Lonrho's other joint broker, to act alone. So, in order to make up
their minds about the latest deal with Bock, shareholders have only the
letter sent to them by Rowland.
Having digested the contents, they indicated yesterday that they could not
understand how the shares were worth 85p, let alone 115p. The shares closed
last night 3p down at 72p.
A major concern is the rise in net debt to Pounds 947m. Almost Pounds 100m
of the borrowings were accounted-for by exchange adjustments to foreign
currency borrowings due to the fall of sterling and motor trade operations.
But there was also a significant increase in capital expenditure and it is
understood this has continued to rise.
Lonrho's decision to negotiate an early end to VAG, its Volkswagen/Audi
import and distribution operations in the UK, is good news for the balance
sheet. The German car-maker, which had planned to take control of the
business when the existing contract expires at the end of 1993, is paying
Lonrho Pounds 124m to take it back early. This could save Lonrho around
Pounds 15m in interest payments.
It is bad news for the profit and loss account, though. Lonrho estimates
that pre-tax profits for the year ended September 30 have fallen from Pounds
205m to Pounds 79m. Without VAG, which made profits of Pounds 25.6m, group
profits (after the reduction of interest payments) could fall by another
Pounds 10m.
All of this means that an even bigger percentage of Lonrho's pre-tax profits
will be generated from Africa. Last year, its operations there accounted for
more than 70 per cent of the pre-tax profits.
But, as one shareholder asked: 'What on earth does Bock know about the
African operations?' Not much, according to one of Bock's advisers.
Small shareholders should follow the lead of Lonrho's institutions and stay
well clear of the rights. Bock has made clear that he will not be letting
anyone know his game plan until after the rights issue closes on January 15.
Investors may as well hold on to their shares until then to see if he has
anything up his sleeve.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Markets: A triumph of glib salesmanship - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVE you recently been offered a cash payout 'which could be worth up to
Pounds 91,300 or more'? If so, you are probably a card member of American
Express and may be finding the prospect of all that loot hard to resist.
After all, if you apply by December 30, you can get a free gift of an alarm
clock, garment carrier or 'luxury bath towel' in a genuine American Express
card design (please do leave home without it).
The offer is a prime example of how a marketing letter can conform to the
regulations set by Lautro and yet be a triumph of slick salesmanship.
What American Express is actually selling is a low-start, 15-year,
with-profits endowment policy from Norwich Union, called Moneybuilder Plus.
There is certainly no secret about this - it is stated in the first two
paragraphs.
But let us look at the second paragraph more closely. 'In brief,' it runs,
'this is an extraordinary 15-year endowment that, thanks to its low start
feature, could offer you a substantially higher cash payout than even
Norwich Union's ordinary 15-year plans. . . for the same initial
contribution'.
Sounds good, doesn't it? Put your cheque books away for a moment. First
examine page two of the letter, which explains it all. 'How surprising,
then, that the 'secret' of this dramatically higher growth should be so
simple: Moneybuilder Plus builds a small, but powerful, yearly increase into
your monthly premiums for the first five years of your plan (and then keeps
them level until the end of the plan).'
In fact, premiums will increase by 20 per cent of the original for each of
the first five years. Your payment for the last ten years will be double the
initial investment.
Hold on a minute. So these 'dramatically higher' returns stem from the fact
that you will be paying 'dramatically higher' premiums?
Let us paraphrase. If you invest Pounds 100 a month in this plan, you will
get a bigger return than if you invest Pounds 50. Extraordinary, as American
Express would say.
Does an increasing premium seem a turn-off? The letter has the answer; the
increase 'could be just a few pence per day'. Not much compared with 'up to
Pounds 91,300 or more', is it?
What about this phrase, which is in big blue print at the top of the letter?
It is none too specific when you think about it. Next to the Pounds 91,300
figure, there is an asterisk which leads to a footnote, which in turn leads
to the policyholder information and benefits table.
This table is based (as required by Lautro) on assumed growth rates of 7 and
10.5 per cent. It shows the potential returns for initial premiums of
between Pounds 30 and Pounds 200 a month. Payouts also vary with age; the
older you are, the greater the cost of life cover.
American Express has not been so crass as to quote the maximum growth rate
on the maximum premium for the youngest person. Not quite. The table shows
that Pounds 91,300 is based on a 10.5 per cent growth rate for a 65-year-old
man paying Pounds 200 a month.
With increasing premiums, that means you would be paying Pounds 400 a month
after five years. Your total premiums over the life of the plan would be
Pounds 64,800, which puts the possible Pounds 91,300 payout in a rather
different light.
The letter claims this is 'a possible return that compares favourably with
expected returns for national savings, building societies and certain stocks
and shares'. Another interesting phrase; if savers could have a list of
Amex's 'certain stocks and shares', investing would be a lot easier over the
next 15 years.
But to make a different comparison, the equivalent sum invested in the
average UK equity general unit trust savings plan over the 15 years to March
1992 would have grown to Pounds 229,000, according to Money Management.
The next 15 years may well be a lot less exciting for unit trust returns
(although this will affect Norwich Union's plan as well). But it is far from
certain that Norwich Union will produce returns which beat rival products -
as John Authers writes on Page IV, it is about to cut bonuses on
with-profits policies for the second year running.
A further factor, of course, is that there is no life cover in a unit trust
savings plan. But the letter concentrates on the investment, not the
insurance, aspects of the plan. After all, on page three it says: 'Just
imagine what you could do with all that money. You could take that world
cruise you've always dreamed of, or perhaps buy a new boat or car.'
Maybe. Not if you start by investing Pounds 30 a month; then you are looking
forward (on the same assumptions) to just Pounds 13,300 after 15 years. If
inflation averages five per cent per annum, that figure will halve in real
terms over 15 years; in other words, it would be worth Pounds 6,650 in
today's money. You could get a car for that price, but a BMW is out.
American Express says that customers who have doubts can ring its financial
services arm and get independent financial advice about the nature of the
product and indeed other products if they are more suitable. And to be fair
to Amex, no one could be misled about the nature of the product if they read
the product particulars (which are included in the pack, as required by
regulation). But there are no big blue letters, no underlined words such as
'dramatically higher' in the particulars; just sober facts about a modest
product which has been over-hyped.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The royal dilemma that won't go away: David Cannadine
predicts that 1993 will contain even more bad news for the beleaguered House
of Windsor
</HEADLINE>

which they almost certainly are - the Queen's annus horribilis is going to
drag out through every remaining day of this month until the bells ring out
the old year at midnight on December 31. But it seems inconceivable that
things will end there. For despite the expressions of sympathy and support,
there now appears every prospect that, for both the Queen and her visibly
disintegrating family, 1993 may well be an annus even more horribilis.
Consider the facts. In the course of the past seven days, there has been the
announcement of the Princess Royal's second wedding, which is being rushed
through today with express speed. In between, there has been the news of the
apparently amicable separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, by
comparison with which all the previous royal exposures, conflagrations and
publicity disasters of this year pale into insignificance.
Despite conservative fears and republican hopes, the monarchy is not
self-destructing. However open to ridicule it is in danger of becoming in
the popular press, the show will go on. But the stage has been reached when
the monarchy is pushing the panic button, loud and clear. For the only
conclusion that can be drawn from the terms of the separation settlement is
that neither the palace nor the government has the slightest idea what will
happen next.
It is being insisted in certain official quarters that this separation
arrangement is itself the solution; that the Prince and Princess of Wales
should now be allowed to live their separate and private lives; and that the
future is assured because they will one day come together again as king and
queen. But the settlement has only to be summarised in this way for it to be
clear that, far from being a solution to a problem, it will only make things
worse.
It might well be the case that, the bizarre nature of these terms and future
provisions notwithstanding, nothing else could have been done at this time.
The royal couple could not have gone on as they were; but neither party
wanted an instant divorce, so what else was there to do? And it is also the
case that, now the long-expected and long-predicted separation has actually
happened, the mood of the public is not as easy to gauge or to predict as
had seemed likely before the event.
The truth is that it is not yet clear - and might not be clear for many
months - just how this latest royal misadventure is going to play out in
terms of the public's reaction and response. Already, though, there are
ominous signs that this settlement is not going to work. For all the claims
that there are no constitutional issues and implications, there seems a real
possibility that the monarchy will suffer grave damage. And if a gravely
damaged monarchy is not a constitutional issue, then what is?
Take Prince Charles first. Whatever the reality of his marriage and its
breakdown, recent press coverage shows he is regarded widely as a man who
has failed spectacularly to do the one thing which, rightly or wrongly,
people still expect the heir to the throne to do: namely, to live his family
life successfully. The prince, so this argument runs, has spent a great deal
of time telling society what is good for it. But what right has he to do
this when he has made such a conspicuous hash of his own life?
This leads us to Princess Diana. She might be the most glamorous woman in
the country - indeed, in the world - combining in a remarkable way the
attributes of mother and martyr, saint and cover girl. And it might also be
that this settlement, in which she keeps both the children and her crown, is
a personal triumph for her which she was able to accomplish only because of
her extraordinary public standing. But the idea that, despite all the
sadness of her marriage to Prince Charles, she might still want - and
expect? - to be queen, seems incredible.
Then there is the question of Charles and Diana as separated spouses. What
is going to happen now? Will they have affairs and take lovers? Is it
realistic to suppose that they will be able to keep it a secret if they do?
The prospect of the heir to the throne and his wife leading separate sex
lives must surely be a tabloid editor's dream. In short, the insatiable
appetite of the media for more scandals and more revelations inevitably will
be stimulated by this separation settlement.
What, then, are the realistic prospects of their joint coronation? Only
royal advisers desperate to find a ray of hope - and completely out of touch
with the public mood - could have expected that this proposal would fly. The
idea that at some future, unspecified date, Charles and Diana will give up
their separate lives and come together once more, however briefly, as king
and queen, is an insult to common sense and to the Church of England under
whose auspices the sacrament of their coronation would take place.
Then there is the unfortunate figure of Prince William: the product, like
his mother, of a broken marriage. Already, he is being seen in some quarters
as the next best hope. If only the Prince of Wales will renounce his right
of succession, the argument runs, the crown can pass on, unimpaired, to his
eldest son and this regrettable interlude can be forgotten. But it is not
clear, despite much speculation on the subject, that William - who must have
suffered much already - can be the person to solve the difficulties caused
by his parents' marital break-up.
In short, it is hard to avoid the conclusion that this separation settlement
will not settle or stabilise anything. On the contrary, in many ways it can
only make matters worse, more risky and more uncertain than when the royal
pair maintained an official fiction of marriage. The uncertainties will
last, not just into 1993 but for an unforeseeably protracted future. There
might indeed have been no alternative: but that serves only to show how
intractable things have become, and how miserable the prospects appear.
This brings us to the broader issue to which this latest royal disaster
relates. The separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales will not only
intensify the prurient intrusiveness of the tabloid press: it will also
intensify the debate about the purpose, function and future of the monarchy
itself (a debate, it must be remembered, to which the Queen herself gave her
royal imprimatur recently).
In the long perspective of history, the problem which, it seemed, the
British had solved brilliantly was that of finding something for a monarchy
to do once its traditional functions - as law-giver and warrior - had been
given up or taken away.
The solution which evolved was 'constitutional monarchy' which, essentially,
meant trading power for pageantry, dynastic profligacy for a royal family,
and Germanic accents for an imperial crown.
The fundamental difficulty for the monarchy today is that, during the
present queen's reign, these functions and justifications have been
gradually but inexorably eroded. She herself is among a declining number in
England who believe in the Commonwealth. And the pageantry of which royal
weddings were such an integral part has surely now become questionable: it
certainly has for Princess Anne at Crathie church today.
Deprived of these 'traditional' functions, it is not altogether clear what
there is left for the British monarchy to do. Or, put more depressingly, it
is not at all clear what the sovereign, her relatives and her advisers
believe there is to do. Perhaps the course is set already and a Monaco
monarchy - trivialised and a perpetual scandal-machine - is indeed the only
future function on offer. (After all, in the long run, the British monarchy
has swung repeatedly from respectability to scandal and back to
respectability again. Perhaps what we are now witnessing is merely the next
inexorable swing of the pendulum).
The British monarchy has survived damaging troublesbefore - most obviously
in the time of the delinquent children of King George III - and it could
well be that it will survive the latest scandals as well. But the 1990s are
not the 1820s. Then, Britain was a rigidly hierarchical society and, in the
majority of countries, monarchy was still the natural order of things.
Today, by contrast, monarchy can be seen as an anachronistic relic which, if
it is to survive as anything more than a tawdry and demeaning soap opera,
must do something serious, sensible and substantial to justify itself.
Thus far, that is the challenge to which the embattled and beleaguered House
of Windsor has failed conspicuously to rise this year. What is the British
monarchy for? What sort of monarchy have we got? What sort of monarchy do we
need? Do we need a monarchy at all? As the royal family falls apart before
our curious eyes, these questions are going to become more, not less,
insistent.
If the Queen is serious in wanting debate on the monarchy, she will be well
advised to address the issues in her Christmas message. Platitudes about
peace on earth, happy families and her annus horribilis will no longer
suffice.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The Long View: Ministry of silly rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASUAL READERS of bond market reports must wonder what sort of a mad world
they have stumbled on. On one day this week, for instance, market reporters
were explaining that US government bond prices had risen because of the
strength shown by recent economic data, while UK gilt-edged prices had
drifted lower in view of indications of emerging British recovery.
Spot the contradiction: the latter explanation is the more conventional, as
bond investors tend to lap up gloom - unless things get so bad that war,
social unrest or hyperinflation threaten returns. The challenge at home,
meantime, is the debt mountain which must be financed by the British
government; long-term interest rates have been edging up in the past month.
It is not easy to see where Pounds 50bn-plus of gilts can be sold. The total
cash flow of big investment institutions such as pension funds and insurance
companies is only about Pounds 40bn, and foreign investors have stopped
buying gilts. One possible answer, put forward particularly by leading
monetarists such as Tim Congdon, is that we could take a leaf out of the US
book and sell them to the banks. Over the past four years, US banks'
holdings of US government securities have risen by nearly Dollars 300bn.
There is a fascinating story here. If the US succeeds in its
against-the-odds recovery from the horrors of full-blown debt deflation,
most of the praise will be due to Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal
Reserve. Early in the 1930s, the US banking system contracted disastrously,
but Greenspan now has pulled out all the stops to prevent this happening
again, not only by bailing out busted banks but by giving the whole banking
system an opportunity to expand its balance sheet in a highly profitable
way. Thus, banks can borrow through the money markets at 3 per cent and buy
treasury securities yielding 5 or 6 per cent. Weakness in private sector
loan demand has not mattered.
It is true that, to follow such a strategy, you have to be indifferent to
some rather wild swings in the external value of your currency. You also
have to worry about what might happen when the recovery comes. There are at
present some huge speculative positions in the US government securities
market, notably on the part of the leading Wall Street investment banks;
and, if short-term interest rates were to start to rise, there could be some
massive unloading of government bonds.
At this stage, however, Greenspan appears to be winning. In British
parlance, the Americans are 'underfunding' their deficit on a very large
scale by failing to find non-bank investors for a large proportion of the
paper being issued. The British government, however, is labouring under the
self-imposed discipline of 'full funding,' which means that purchases of
government paper by banks do not count towards financing the public sector
borrowing requirement. One consequence, as Congdon says, is that whereas
American banks have 22 per cent of their assets in government loans and
securities, UK banks have only a minuscule 3 per cent in that category - but
they have 87 per cent in UK private sector lending, of often rather dubious
quality.
Now, full funding versus underfunding is arguably the world's most obscure
debate. In fact, so long as we were in the exchange rate mechanism, the US
strategy was out of the question, anyway, because short-term interest rates
had to be kept higher than gilt-edged returns. But we have now floated our
way towards an upward-sloping yield curve, not yet as steep as the American
one but already offering the banks some interesting possibilities, which
they are oddly slow to pursue.
But we need motive as well as opportunity. The trigger point could come
soon. As it happens, the authorities have actually been overfunding recently
because of their purchase of billions of pounds sterling from George Soros
and other grateful speculators. The money markets have been quite tight and
sterling has strengthened. Through the winter, the government will be
underfunding temporarily to counteract this. Further ahead, though, the
pressure on the authorities will build, and the government could at some
stage be desperate to get away its latest Pounds 2.5bn auction. A relaxation
of the full funding rule would give the long-dated part of the gilt market a
useful, if temporary, tonic. Funding through the banks would be concentrated
at the short-dated end.
But you would then have to believe that an underfunding government would,
however inconvenient it might be, change readily to another policy - one of
overfunding - once the economy was expanding and private sector credit
demand was serving to maintain an adequate rate of monetary growth.
Here is the nub of the problem, for an arbitrary and arguably silly rule
like full funding might at least be a valuable way of keeping a wayward
finance ministry under some sort of control. The principle was introduced by
former chancellor Nigel Lawson when he abandoned broad money growth targets
in 1985 as a means of giving assurance that the public sector would not
generate inflation. The British government has, nevertheless, had a
particularly poor record on monetary policy since the mid-'80s. The
likelihood that it will cope skilfully and responsibly with the monetary
consequences of an economic recovery during 1993 or 1994 seems remote. The
switch to underfunding will probably happen at precisely the wrong moment.
What about Bill Clinton and those US treasury bonds? With so much
speculative capital riding the bond markets, there are considerable dangers.
The prospect of a big spending push by the new president has raised blood
pressure among bond investors. However, if GDP already is climbing in the
third quarter at a 3.9 per cent annual rate, as statisticians claim, Clinton
could keep most of his powder dry. But you would be unwise to believe
everything you read in bond market reports.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Somali warlords agree to immediate ceasefire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE, DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOGADISHU, BRUSSELS, LITTLE ROCK, ARKANSAS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOMALIA'S two main warlords, who have plunged the country into anarchy and
starvation over the past two years, yesterday agreed an immediate ceasefire.
Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohamed, the feuding clan-barons who
control parts of the divided capital Mogadishu, met for the first time in
more than a year. Afterwards, they shook hands, smiled and announced a
seven-point peace plan.
The meeting, organised by Mr Robert Oakley, the US ambassador-at-large, took
place in the temporary US embassy which was ringed by Marines and secured
from the air by Cobra helicopter gunships.
Both warlords, forced to the table by the speed and efficiency of the US and
French military deployment in the capital, said they had also agreed to
withdraw their armies from the streets, end hostile propaganda and demolish
the 'green line' which divides the city. The two will meet again today
aboard a French aid ship.
Many Somalis questioned how genuine the hasty reconciliation was, given the
deep bitterness which divides the two men and which had defeated the best
efforts of the United Nations to reach a settlement. Differences also
emerged as Mr Mahdi, the self-styled president, asked the US to disarm all
Somalis and to bring the UN deeper into the intervention - two steps
strongly resisted by Gen Aideed.
The US military build-up continued in Mogadishu with the arrival of more
troops. There were further incidents between Somalis and US and French
forces who have mounted impromptu road blocks across the city to help end
the piracy of relief food.
On day three of the military intervention, tempers flared as Somalis tested
the nerve and authority of the foreign troops. A few warning shots were
fired, a journalist was shot in the leg and another stabbed by increasingly
hostile Mogadishu residents.
Somalis also gathered at the site where French paratroopers shot dead two
Somalis who, the French alleged, tried to break through a roadblock on
Thursday night. UN representatives called for an inquiry into the incident.
David White, defence correspondent, reports from Brussels: The US plans to
withdraw most of its forces in three months, Mr Dick Cheney, US defence
secretary, said yesterday.
Speaking after a Nato defence ministers' meeting in Brussels, he said he
hoped that withdrawals could begin by late January through arrangements to
transfer authority in some areas to UN peacekeepers. However, certain
specialised US forces such as logistics troops and combat engineers might
have to stay longer.
Reuter adds from Little Rock, Arkansas: President-elect Bill Clinton said
last night that he could not put 'a fixed timetable' on the US operation.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Collectors of Royal souvenirs prove to be no mugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME COLLECTORS of royal memorabilia are already calling it 'black
December'.
Buckingham Palace has received just one request for permission to
commemorate today's wedding of the Princess Royal and Commander Tim
Laurence, compared with hundreds for previous royal nuptials.
The separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales, announced this week,
might be seen as a crowning blow for the royal memorabilia market, worth an
estimated Pounds 10m a year in Britain alone. But some dealers believe that
Charles and Diana memorabilia is likely to increase in value as a result.
'While it is still early days, we know that since Andrew and Sarah have
split up, the market for their memorabilia has increased markedly,' says Mr
Alan Margenroth, a dealer in royal commemorative china with Govier's of
Sidmouth, who refused to commission a cup commemorating the divorce of the
Princess Royal and Captain Mark Phillips.
Some collectors are happy at the prospect of a drop in demand for
memorabilia. Mr Steven Jackson, secretary of the Commemorative Collectors
Society, says: 'The market is slowly being returned to the serious
collectors.'
Manufacturers blame the short notice for the wedding - just seven days  -
for the lack of Anne and Tim memorabilia. Some also say there seems to be
little interest in the event.
'We didn't think anyone would want to buy Anne and Tim tea towels,' said one
manufacturer in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire.
At Royal Doulton, which like the Financial Times is owned by Pearson, Ms
Anne Linscott, corporate communications director, says: 'We normally need at
least several months' notice to design and produce a limited edition set.'
The company that is making a mug and fine china beaker for today's wedding
is Peter Jones China of Wakefield, West Yorkshire.
Mugs retailing at Pounds 19.99 will be on sale next week with a limited
edition of 1,000 beakers at Pounds 39.95.
Commemorative, limited royal editions are often oversubscribed, ensuring an
immediate premium for investors. The Royal Crown Derby Queen Mother's 90th
birthday loving cup, of which 500 were issued in 1990 at Pounds 75, now
fetches Pounds 160.
Political memorabilia is also popular; the Margaret Thatcher loving cup,
celebrating her third general election victory in 1987, fetches more than
the cup celebrating the Queen's 60th birthday in 1986 of similar price and
edition size.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Russian talks to avert crisis fail to reach compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS aimed at easing the political crisis in Russia broke up without
agreement last night as the Congress of People's Deputies blocked President
Boris Yeltsin's move for a referendum to dissolve the top legislature.
Mr Yeltsin and Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, were unable
to find common ground during a meeting arranged late yesterday.
The crisis erupted at the Congress on Thursday when Mr Yeltsin appealed for
a referendum through which the people could put their trust in him to
provide reform, rather than in the presently constituted parliament.
Elections would be called for a new parliament if the president won that
vote.
Mr Yeltsin's proposal followed the refusal of Congress the previous day to
confirm Mr Yegor Gaidar as prime minister.
Deputies approved an amendment to the referendum law explicitly banning any
plebiscite that would result in the dissolution of a high state body.
The amendment was rejected on a first vote, but approved in a second poll
following technical objections from deputies. It was pushed strongly by Mr
Khasbulatov, who spoke scathingly of Mr Yeltsin's camp.
Nothing in the comments made by spokesmen afterwards indicated that the two
men had narrowed their differences. Mr Yeltsin established the limits of
compromise by sticking to his choice of Mr Gaidar as prime minister.
The two men met only after deputies had shuttled between them with various
proposed compromises.
The prime mediator, Mr Valkery Zorkin, head of the constitutional court, who
also attended the meetings, finally brought the two men together.
Mr Yeltsin is to meet Mr Khasbulatov and Mr Zorkin today, with deputies from
a cross-section of parliamentary factions, in a further search for
consensus.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Prudential
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Prudential's decision to shed the last of its commercial business more
or less completes the reshaping since Mr Mick Newmarch took charge in 1990.
As the shares have outperformed the market by 25 per cent in that time, the
market might reasonably wonder where the company goes from here. Yesterday's
4 per cent fall suggests more than a smidgeon of uncertainty.
For one thing, general reinsurance is still bleeding cash. The Pru's rating
will doubtless receive another boost if a buyer is ever found, but that
could be years away. Compared to the risks elsewhere in the sector, though,
Prudential is sitting pretty. While composite insurers look better geared to
recovery, mortgage indemnity claims could be a millstone well into the
middle of the decade.
With the estate agencies, commercial business and troublesome overseas
operations out of the way, Prudential's growth prospects turn on the
long-term savings business. The immediate outlook is rosy enough. The new
business boom of the early 1980s should feed into profits as 10-year
policies mature. That underpins the promise to increase the dividend this
year. Whether Mr Newmarch can keep new business flowing and expenses under
control is another matter. There are certainly signs of self-confidence.
Prudential's new accruals method of accounting for life profits makes the
new business performance more transparent. By introducing it, Mr Newmarch
has nailed his colours firmly to the mast.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The Lex Column: Down with inflation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In different times the equity market might have responded more positively to
news that inflation had fallen to its lowest level in six years. Since the
chancellor appears to have ruled out further cuts in interest rates for the
time being, there is less cause for celebration. Besides, part of the fall
in the underlying rate to 3.6 per cent from 3.8 per cent reflects unusual
softness in food prices. That is unlikely to continue after January when the
green pound devaluation will start to be felt. Slowing inflation also
suggests that most businesses do not yet have sufficient confidence to push
aggressively for price rises. The deflationary effects of recession remain
strong.
Lower mortgage rates could see headline inflation dip below 2 per cent in
the first quarter. The difficult question is what will happen after that. On
one view, price pressures from devaluation could still be damped by falling
unit labour costs. A low headline rate would also reinforce the government's
effort to hold down public sector pay.
However the temptation for business to recoup lost margins with price
increases will surely become irresistible once real recovery is under way.
That is underlined by Ford's price increase this week. The budget, too,
could push up prices; the chancellor has already promised to claw back the
car tax with additional costs for the motorist. The suspicion lingers that
the lower the inflation rate falls now, the sharper will be its later
rebound. Perhaps that is why index-linked gilts reacted to November's
monthly fall in the retail prices with gains of around a quarter point.

FT  12 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt feels the chill winds of
recession - Investors believe that German equities will only recover when
the Bundesbank eases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
News yesterday that Klockner-Werke, a big steel, plastics and machinery
group, had filed for the German equivalent of Chapter 11 protection from its
creditors is the latest in a series of blows for the German stock market.
In the past few months, one company after another has announced poor profits
and plans to trim staff. These include Daimler-Benz, the country's biggest
industrial company, where earnings are likely to drop by a quarter over this
year, as well as virtually all the motor companies, the big chemicals
companies and the large engineering groups.
This is vivid evidence that after two years of post-reunification growth,
which decoupled Germany from the economic downturn afflicting most of the
rest of the world, the country is sliding rapidly from stagnation to
recession.
Economists are predicting zero growth for west German GDP next year, a
prognosis which may soon look too optimistic.
Furthermore, the interest rate environment in Germany remains harsh,
especially given the weakness of the economy. The Bundesbank raised interest
rates to historically high levels in July, reduced them only grudgingly
during September's European currency crisis, and failed to deliver a
long-awaited further cut in rates after its regular council meeting on
Thursday.
None of this was forecast a year ago when brokers were making their
forecasts for 1992. As Mr Uwe Flach, a main board director of the DG Bank,
said ruefully in a recent speech, the expectation was that the DAX index
would climb from around 1,550 to 1,900 - a mistaken prognosis, he admitted.
For the first few months of the year, such expectations seemed to be
justified and the index climbed to 1,812 in the last week of May. But it has
since fallen back below 1,500 and is now 4.5 per cent below its level at the
start of the year.
Seasoned investors know that an equity market can rally even during the
deepest recession, but there is little support for the view that now is a
good time to buy German equities. The best that analysts hope for is a small
rally towards the end of the first quarter next year, but a sustained
recovery is only likely in the second half.
The reasoning behind this is that the full deterioration of the economy has
yet to feed through into equity prices. There has been a general reluctance
by both investors and managers of German companies to believe that Germany
could fall victim to a fully-fledged recession, after 10 years of unbroken
growth.
Even if other German companies do not suffer the same fate as
Klockner-Werke, their fourth-quarter profit figures - not to be published
until late January or February - could come in well below expectations and
prompt further share price weakness.
Working against this pessimistic view is the widespread hope that the
Bundesbank will eventually cut its headline interest rates, in line with its
stance in previous recessions when it has relaxed policy significantly.
According to many forecasts, the Lombard rate is likely to fall to 7 per
cent by the end of next year, from 9.50 per cent now.
Recent confirmation of weakness in the economy - combined with the first
signs of wage restraint (steelworkers in the north-west of Germany settled
for 3.3 per cent between 1992 and 1994) - has encouraged the belief that the
Bundesbank will cut its rates during the first quarter of next year.
When the Bundesbank finally cuts its rates, this should revive the equity
market. If the cut is generous enough to be taken as an unequivocal sign
that the era of high interest rates is over, it will also provide an
incentive for investors to look beyond Germany's short-term troubles.
But there are two problems here. Firstly, it is by no means certain that the
Bundesbank will cut interest rates that quickly, or that sharply: as Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the bank's president, made clear again this week,
inflation at 3.7 per cent is still too high in Germany and the increase in
VAT scheduled for the beginning of next year will take it above 4 per cent.
Moreover, Mr Schlesinger maintains that long-term interest rates have been
cut already. Long bund yields are at 7.3 per cent, where they were before
reunification and down from 8.4 per cent a year ago. He also maintains that
high short-term rates have not damaged the economy.
The second problem is that even when rates are cut, say, towards the end of
the first quarter, there may still be more bad news to come on the economy.
Thus the equity rally induced by the first cut in the Lombard rate may be
short-lived.
Consequently, brokers are already looking ahead to 1994, by which time they
confidently expect the US and other countries in Europe to have pulled their
economies out of recession and in so doing, will help export-orientated
Germany to recover.

FT  12 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow falls as storms keep
traders away

Wall Street
US SHARE prices remained weak across the board yesterday in a market that
was unusually quiet in the wake of a heavy rainstorm that flooded parts of
downtown Manhattan, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 8.11 at 3,304.08,
having traded throughout the day only a few points below Thursday's close.
The more broadly based Standard&amp;Poor's 500 moved in similar fashion, ending
down 0.92 at 433.72, while the Amex composite edged 0.99 higher to 393.38
and the Nasdaq composite dropped 3.15 to 655.78. Turnover on the New York SE
was well down from recent levels at 165m shares, and declines outpaced rises
by 903 to 839.
Trading was greatly affected by the winter storms that hit the North East
coast, with many market participants unable to make it into work. Due to
flooding near Wall Street and the shutdown of much of New York's transit
system, the government bond markets closed early at 1pm.
The Labor department announced that consumer prices rose just 0.2 per cent
in November, in line with market expectations. Following Thursday's news of
a decline in producer prices last month, analysts are confident that
inflationary pressures are not building up despite the gathering pace of the
recovery.
The other economic news came from the University of Michigan, which reported
another big rise in its monthly index of consumer confidence, evidence that
the surge in optimism recorded since the election carried through into early
December.
Although the two sets of data were positive, share prices eased because some
investors continue to take profits earned during the recent rally and others
remain wary of a market they believe looks over-bought.
Among individual stocks, IBM staged a mini-recovery, rising Dollars 5/8 to
Dollars 62 3/8 and reversing a week of declines prompted by renewed concern
about further restructuring and talk of a possible threat to the company's
dividend.
Smith International climbed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 8 3/4 in busy trading
after the company announced it was selling its Directional Systems &amp;
Services business to Halliburton for about Dollars 240m in Halliburton
stock. The news left Halliburton Dollars  3/8 lower at Dollars 28 3/4 .
Santa Monica Bank dropped Dollars 1 5/8 or 16 per cent, to Dollars 8 7/8
after announcing it would post a loss in 1992 because of the real-estate
recession in its local market. The bank will also be unable to pay a
fourth-quarter dividend.
On the Nasdaq market, Biogen jumped Dollars 3 3/4 to Dollars 47 in turnover
of 2m shares on forecasts from the company that 1992 earnings would come in
above Dollars 1 a share, compared to the 15 cents a share the company earned
in 1991.
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended mixed, leaving the market with a loss on the week.
The TSE-300 fell 2.75 points to 3,267.49 on volume of 34.47m valued at
CDollars 249.7m, according to preliminary figures. The index was down 22
points on the week. Declines led advances 282 to 275.
Eight of the 14 stock groups ended higher.

FT  12 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average eases on
profit-taking

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY surged in the morning session on technical trading related to the
settlement of December futures and options, but the Nikkei average fell back
as afternoon profit-taking erased earlier gains, writes Emiko Terazono in
Tokyo.
The Nikkei fell 60.28 to 17,441.02, down 0.8 per cent on the week, after a
high of 17,635.31 in the morning session, and a day's low of 17,424.67
towards the close.
However, volume rose to 500m shares from 381m, with 300m shares changing
hands in the first hour of trading on settlement-related activity. Declines
led advances by 570 to 402 with 191 issues remaining unchanged. The Topix
index of all first-section stocks fell 3.68 to 1,325.15 and in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 0.96 to 1,070.78.
The index lost ground following the announcement of the Bank of Japan's
tankan, its quarterly survey on business sentiment, which showed that
confidence had fallen to its lowest level since 1975. The business
confidence index for the leading 393 manufacturers fell 7 points to minus
44, while the index declined 14 points to minus 27 for 295
non-manufacturers.
Traders said that while weak figures had been expected, the Bank of Japan's
comments after the tankan's release ruling out an early cut in the official
discount rate discouraged some investors.
Mitsui Mining and Smelting, the day's most active issue, fell Y13 to Y495
after rising on rumours of a discovery of a new gold vein.
High-technology issues were lower as the yen rose against the dollar.
Hitachi fell Y2 to Y745 and Matsushita Electric Industrial fell Y20 to
Y1,170.
In Osaka, the OSE index fell 87.27 to 19,029.06 in volume of 23.8m shares.
Roundup
THE region's markets were mixed at the end of the week.
HONG KONG fell 80 points at the opening on continued disappointment over the
failure of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group to produce a statement on
Thursday. However, bargain-hunting later in the session saw the market
recover some of the ground and the Hang Seng index closed 20.61 lower at
5,253.18, only marginally down on the week. Turnover remained low at
HKDollars 1.85bn.
Among actives, HSBC Holdings lost 50 cents to HKDollars 55 while Jardine
Matheson bucked the trend with a gain of 25 cents to HKDollars 46.25.
SEOUL rose in moderate trading but sentiment remained nervous ahead of next
week's presidential election. The composite index gained 3.67 to 645.70,
down 1.5 per cent on the week. Turnover improved to Won451bn from Won383bn.
TAIWAN, which had fallen more than 30 points at one stage, made up some
losses towards the close on bargain-hunting. The weighted index finished
12.45 lower at 3,734.30, but was up 2.3 per cent on the week. Turnover was
TDollars 8.7bn from TDollars 10bn.
MANILA fell sharply for the third day and the composite index shed another
16.48 to 1,232.36, down 3.7 per cent on the week. Combined turnover stood at
197.2m pesos after 244.9m.
Shares in Philippine Long Distance Telephone fell 20 pesos to 875 pesos.
SINGAPORE saw selective buying in property stocks as the Straits Times
industrial index rose 5.19 to 1,447.57, slightly up on the week.
KUALA LUMPUR weakened on stop-loss selling, but gains in some index-linked
stocks pushed the composite index up 1.32 to 635.26, for a 0.4 per cent fall
on the week. Losers led gainers by 156 to 117 in volume of 86.6m shares.
NEW ZEALAND ended slightly firmer after a lacklustre day's trading and the
NZSE-40 capital index gained 6.08 to end at 1,521.92, up 0.3 per cent on the
week. Turnover was high at NZDollars 34m, NZDollars 8.1m of which was done
in Brierley, up 1 cent at 96 cents.

blow to bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MORE bad news from the corporate sector dealt a fresh blow to bourses
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT ended at its lowest level in five weeks, depressed by the
Bundesbank's decision on Thursday not to lower interest rates and by
yesterday's news that the steel group Klockner-Werke was seeking court
protection from its creditors. The DAX index fell to a day's low of 1,462
but recovered slightly in late trading to finish down 18.47 at 1,476.01, a 3
per cent decline on the week. Turnover rose to DM4.9bn from DM4.2bn.
There was no trading in Klockner-Werke shares which were suspended at
DM58.50. Dr Glen Liddy, a German analyst at Kleinwort Benson, said the news
highlighted the structural problems in the European steel industry  -
overcapacity and depressed prices for products. The German steel makers, in
particular, faced additional problems, he said, because they tended to be
skewed towards supplying the domestic auto industry, which was also in
difficulty.
Other steel makers fell on the announcement: Thyssen dropped DM5.70 to
DM149.60 and Preussag slipped DM6 to DM341.50. Deutsche Bank, which has
already suffered this week from poor 10-month figures, shed a further DM14
to DM627.50 on the fact that it is the steel group's house bank. Viag, which
has an indirect holding in Klockner, dipped DM14.50 to DM319.50.
Daimler was supported by late news on Thursday that the European Fighter
Aircraft project, in which the group has a 33 per cent stake, had been
resuscitated. The stock closed DM5.20 lower at DM509.20, off the day's low
of DM500.60.
PARIS showed signs of year-end fatigue, as more players took up the view
that the market was going nowhere in the short term. Pressure on the franc
despite central bank intervention also worried the market. The CAC-40 index
ended 10.78 lower at 1,758.70, down 1.3 per cent on the week, in turnover of
FFr2bn.
The day's losers included Elf, which fell another FFr10.30 to FFr329.20 and
Saint-Gobain, which lost FFr13 to FFr503. Peugeot surprised with a FFr10
rise to FFr552.
AMSTERDAM featured DSM and Akzo, while Hoogovens slipped Fl 2.40 to Fl 22.80
on news of Klockner-Werke's financial problems. The CBS Tendency index
dropped 0.6 to 104.7, down 0.8 per cent on the week.
DSM lost Fl 5.20 or 6.5 per cent to Fl 74.80 as foreign institutions
switched into Akzo, up Fl 1.50 at Fl 136.50, on news that it had gained US
approval for the sale there of its oral contraceptive.
STOCKHOLM fell across the board as declines in Trelleborg and S-E Banken led
the market slide. The Affarsvarlden general index fell 18.0 or 2 per cent to
883.1, but was up 2.2 per cent on the week, in turnover of SKr604m after
SKr734m.
Both stocks responded to news released after the close on Thursday that
Trelleborg expected a pre-tax loss of SKr1.5bn in 1992 and S-E Banken needed
a capital infusion in the near future.
Trelleborg B shares fell SKr8.50 or 13 per cent to SKr57 and S-E Banken C
unrestricted shares slipped SKr2 or 13 per cent to SKr13. S-E Banken
restricted A shares dropped SKr3.50 or 26 per cent to SKr10.
OSLO tumbled 3.4 per cent as profit-taking eroded almost half of Thursday's
gains inspired by Norway's decision to float the crown. The all-share index
fell 13.46 to 385.92, up 2.6 per cent on the week, in active turnover worth
NKr764.5m.
MILAN ended mixed as dealers squared positions ahead of the close of the
final trading account of the year. The Comit index fell 2.67 to 422.81,
hardly changed on the week, in turnover estimated at around Thursday's
L148.3bn.
Fiat recovered L16 to L3,946 after its recent weakness while Olivetti gained
L20 to L1,750. The banking and insurance sector was weak, as San Paolo fell
L130 to L10,400 and Mediobanca lost L120 to L12,310.
ZURICH was supported by a decline in interest rates and a strong bond
market. The Swiss Market Index rose 5.0 to 1,993.6, up 3 per cent on the
week.
Swiss Re advanced SFr40 to SFr2,610. The insurer announced that it had
placed 16,000 new bearer shares and 125,000 participation certificates at
current market prices following its capital increase.
MADRID recovered from a weak opening on news of the Bank of Spain's cut in
the reserve requirement for banks. The general index closed 0.12 higher at
212.33, up 0.3 per cent on the week, in low turnover of Pta12.9bn.

FT  12 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further profit-taking as account ends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON equities remained a prey to sterling and stock index futures
yesterday, falling sharply in early trading before rallying later in the
session. Investment sentiment remained depressed by the discouragement to
interest rate hopes from Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer.
The close of the day's trading saw a fall of 10.3 for a FT-SE reading of
2,716.2 with traders continuing to take the view that the stock market was
undergoing an expected bout of year-end profit-taking. A slow start to the
new Wall Street session, which added an initial 9 Dow points to its
overnight fall gave no encouragement to London at the end of the day.
Trading volume slipped to 692.1m shares from the 711.8m of the previous
session, but there was a reduction in the tax-related business which
featured trading on the previous day. Retail, or customer, business was
worth Pounds 1.45bn on Thursday, indicating that year-end profit-taking was
at significant levels.
Traders drew comfort from the Footsie's success in rallying from the day's
low of 2,704.2, which came very early in the day and reflected initial
weakness in the stock index futures sector. At last night's close, the
Footsie was 43.2 points down on a week which has seen repeated bouts of
profit-taking on doubts over prospects for a further one point cut in UK
base rates.
Last night also brought the close of the two-week trading account in the UK
stock market which has seen the Footsie fall by 1.6 per cent. Weakeness in
sterling, together with general uncertainty surrounding the EC ministers'
meeting in Edinburgh has encouraged institutional investors to take profits
in UK equities without waiting for the end of the year.
A trading programme from a leading UK investment bank helped the rally in
the stock market during the second half of the session. But the City of
London had largely discounted the UK Retail price index for November,
showing an annualised rise of only 3 per cent.
Government bonds, responding favourably to the UK chancellor's indication
that base rates were likely to remain stable for the rest of this year, put
on about half a point at the longer end.
Equity strategists continued to suggest that, while the medium-term outlook
for equities remains firm, there may be rotation early in the new year from
1992 outperformers into stocks which have underperformed.
Trading volume has risen sharply as share profits have been taken in the
wake of the sharp gains recorded since mid-September.

FT  12 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Broker caution hits Pru
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that Prudential Corporation, the UK's biggest general insurance group,
is pulling out of the rest of the commercial lines business in the UK plus a
profits downgrade instigated by Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL), the
stockbroker, saw the insurance group's shares under heavy selling pressure
yesterday.
The stock fell 11 to 281p, or 3.8 per cent, on hefty turnover of 5.6m
shares.
The latest move by Prudential follows its decision earlier this year to pull
out of the general insurance broker market. Pru's commercial lines interests
involve small business, individual commercial policies and commercial motor
insurance.
Mr Jonathan Sheehan at Credit Lyonnais lowered his current year profits
estimate from Pounds 450m to Pounds 415m, citing three main factors.
Firstly, the deterioration at M &amp; G's reinsurance business, secondly, a
slimming down of the business which could involve provisioning of up to
Pounds 10m. Thirdly, he mentioned the recent firmer trend in sterling and
expectations of provisions against the Canadian life business. The Laing
analyst said he had told clients to top-slice their holdings in Prudential.
Ladbroke blow
A profit downgrade in Ladbroke by one of the company's joint brokers sent
the shares reeling in very heavy turnover, although they later rallied.
Smith New Court chopped Pounds 19m from its 1992 forecast to Pounds 191m and
Pounds 10m from 1993's to Pounds 220m. Some houses were already revising
their figures last night after learning of the Smith move and speaking to
the company. Others are expected to follow suit on Monday.
Smith blames higher interest charges owing to currency fluctuations and
other charges arising from changes in debt. The shares tumbled on the news,
falling 9 before rallying to close just 4 off at 180p. Turnover was a heavy
11m. Analysts said that Ladbroke's secure and high-yielding dividend helped
underpin the shares, despite the downgrade.
Dealers were astonished at the continuing level of demand for shares in
Tadpole Technology, the computer work station designer, whose shares made
their market debut on Monday.
Opening at 73p on Monday morning, compared with a placing price of 65p a
share carried out by Henry Cooke Lumsden, the Manchester-based stockbroker,
Tadpole shares shot up to 85p that day, to 113p on Tuesday, 135p on
Wednesday, 143p by Thursday and rounded off a tumultuous week by soaring to
194p yesterday, a day's gain of 48p. Turnover yesterday reached 2.1m shares.
Some traders, shocked by the performance of the stock, advised caution and
suggested switching some of the profits made in the stock into other shares
in the sector.
The impact of this switching saw Sage leap 21 to 498p, Sanderson move up 18
to 242p and MicroFocus improve 58 to 2618p.
A roller-coaster ride in Great Universal Stores finished with the shares
closing 12 ahead at 1630p, after being 35 off at one stage. One leading
broker was said to have brought a large line of stock in the previous day's
trading at 1640p and been finally forced to cut and run, selling 200,000
into the market when the price reached 1595p. A further 100,000 dribbled out
at lower levels. Bargain hunters then appeared and the price moved swiftly
ahead in heavy turnover for the tightly-traded stock of 1.2m.
There was good two-way business in Hillsdown, with the shares slipping 3 to
111p.
Food retailers, which this week hit a five-year high against the FT
All-Share, drifted back in average trading and a modicum of profit-taking.
Tesco fell 3 to 245p on 6m traded, Sainsbury, 3 down to 529p and Kwik Save 5
to 777p.
Argyll continued to slip, Goldman Sachs yesterday becoming the latest to
consider its recent surge to be overdone. However, the US-owned broker says
it still expects the shares to outperform in the long-term. Yesterday they
lost 6 to 386p.
Profit downgradings from several brokers hit English China Clays, and the
shares fell 7 early in the day before recovering to close 3 off at 426p. BZW
reduced its current year forecast by Pounds 7m to Pounds 85m and the
following year's figure by Pounds 14m to Pounds 98m. Mr Mark Cusack at the
securities house blamed tough trading conditions particularly on the
industrial minerals side for the reduction and added: 'Volumes are holding
up but prices and margins are under continuous pressure.' Kleinwort Benson
and S. G. Warburg were also said to have reduced forecasts.
Shares in Cookson Group ignored a modest profits downgrading from County
NatWest and closed 6 up at 184p, after the same broker recommended the
stock. County reduced the current year figure by Pounds 5m to Pounds 70m but
moved the stock to a 'Buy-Outperform' recommendation because of 'Cookson's
ability to get substantial growth without the need to assume any economic
upturn.'
Profit-taking in Tomkins saw the shares fall 10 to 237p, making it the day's
biggest retreat among FT-SE 100 stocks. Turnover reached 3.6m.
Burmah Castrol edged up 4 to 670p with a number of broking houses taking the
view that the stock has been oversold on worries about the extent of the
economic downturn on the Continent, and especially in Germany.
British Petroleum rallied modestly, edging ahead to 222p on almost 9m
traded, helped by the small rally in crude oil prices. Specialists noted
more of the recent large-scale selling by UK instititutions, with all of the
stock said to be winging its way across the Atlantic Ocean to the US, where
the big institutions continue to see the company as a strong currency and
recovery play.
An early bout of profit-taking caused a retreat in Reuters. The shares
closed 22 lighter at 1351p. RTZ also suffered the same fate, falling 6 to
638p on trade of 1.1m. But it was a stock overhang that was said to have
weakened BAT and the shares gave up 8 to 946p.
Turnover in Hanson rose to 12m with a substantial part of the day's volume
said to be a result of a programme trade. The shares closed 3 lighter at
223p, with the company's reports and accounts landing on investors' desks in
the last half-hour of trading.
Hotel group Forte gained 3 to 167p as BZW was said to be recommending the
stock in the wake of its deal this week to sell its Gardner Merchant
catering subsidiary. First Leisure improved 7 to 307p following remarks from
the chairman that trading was holding up. A squeeze sent Thorn EMI forward 9
to 813p. An upgrade and buy recommendation from Smith New Court helped
Resort Hotels add 1 1/2 to 25 1/2 p.
Among engineers, Siebe which reported figures earlier this week, jumped 6 to
397p, with Charterhouse Tilney said to have shown a keen interest in the
stock. A stock overhang following a large sell order depressed IMI and the
shares closed 15 lower at 237p.
In transports, a large US seller of Tiphook, which reports figures on
Monday, caused a slide in the stock towards the end of the session. The
shares fell 25 to 284p, making it the day's biggest fall in the market in
percentage terms.
BICC, a weak market in recent days, picked up to close a net 17 higher at
304p with the shares said to have been recommended by one of the UK
integrated broking firms.
Insurance broker Sedgwick attracted exceptionally heavy support and moved up
6 to 156p amid hints of a big broker buy note in the near future.
Building materials and contracting group Tarmac jumped 6 to 105p, after
106p, as the market responded to the latest burst of takeover speculation.

FT  12 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a tight range on the last day of the
underlying equity account, as technical trading ahead of next week's expiry
of the December FT-SE Index contract brought improved turnover in futures,
writes Joel Kibazo.
A poor opening on the December FT-SE contract brought selling, sending the
contract to the day's low of 2,718, and hit the cash market.
A leading US house was a big buyer of gilts after the release of inflation
figures, and this encouraged renewed buying interest of the December
contract. It rose to the day's high of 2,738 ahead of lunch before trading
in a narrow range of 2,725, and 2,735 for the rest of the session. Once
again dealers reported good roll-over from the December contract into March.
December closed at 2,727, nine points above estimated fair value premium and
about four above cash. Turnover was a healthy 11,582 lots.
Traded options were dull, with turnover reaching only 20,271 contracts, with
the FT-SE 100 option a mere 6,346.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the markets): Russian
turmoil halts oil slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL turmoil in Russia helped produce a dramatic change in oil market
sentiment this week, something desperate efforts by members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries had previously failed to
achieve.
On Wednesday the price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery dropped
by 30 cents to Dollars 17.70 a barrel - its lowest level since March. The
following day, as thousands of supporters and opponents of Mr Boris Yeltsin
held rival protests near Moscow's Red Square after the Russian premier's
call for a referendum, the price rebounded by 50 cents, or nearly 3 per
cent, Dollars 18.20 a barrel.
It continued to move up early yesterday and reached Dollars 18.70 at one
point in London but after news came in that Mr Yeltsin and representatives
of Russia's legislature had agreed to resolve the crisis 'in strict
accordance with the constitution', it dropped back again to Dollars 18.12.
Russia is the world's biggest oil producer and it exports about 2m barrels
of oil a day (b/d) to the west. Traders said they were worried that a
deepening political crisis there might disrupt export supplies. Russia's
output has already been falling dramatically.
The change in sentiment was also aided by Iran's indication on Thursday that
it was ready to cut production below the level allocated to it by Opec if
prices remained weak. Then the US was hit by storms, which first swept
through the mid-west. Yesterday the north east of the US was assailed by
what forecasters suggested was one of the worst winter storms in recent
years. They said the extremely cold weather would continue for at least a
week. Wind, rain and snow stopped many traders getting to New York's
commodity exchanges on time yesterday and business was very thin at the
start of the day.
Another of life's necessities - coffee - seems set to go up in price in
retail outlets following a strong surge on world markets which took roasters
by surprise. Reuter reported yesterday that European coffee manufacturers
were considering increasing retail prices because the present rally might be
the start of a long-term trend.
Coffee's recovery since May, when the London Robusta price was Dollars 670 a
tonne - its lowest since the early 1970s - to a 13-month high of Dollars
1,037 a tonne at one stage yesterday, has been helped by expectations of
lower crop levels in Brazil and Colombia and the fact that the International
Coffee Organisation is still hoping to negotiate a new price-support pact by
the end of March. This would take effect when the present administrative
accord expires in September next year.
On the London Metal Exchange yesterday zinc prices were sent plummeting to
Dollars 1,055 a tonne by the revelation that stocks in the exchange's
authorised warehouses had risen by an astonishing 37,325 tonnes to a record
432,175 tonnes. This followed a 15,800-tonne rise reported by the LME on
Tuesday and indicated a 14 per cent jump in one week.
Traders said it was probably physically impossible for so much metal to have
been delivered in such a short space of time so the zinc must already have
been in warehouses for several weeks but not previously been registered as
LME stock.
They suggested the stock explosion resulted from the long-running series of
squeezes on the LME's zinc market which caused the exchange's executive
several times to warn traders it was closely monitoring the market. At one
time in the summer the LME imposed a limit on zinc's daily backwardation
(premium for metal for immediate delivery).
After the initial shock yesterday, traders said investment fund buying
emerged and the price recovered. Zinc for delivery in three months ended
yesterday at Dollars 1,0975 a tonne, up Dollars 6.75 on the day but down
Dollars 9.75 in the past week.
Worries about Russian supplies also buoyed up the price of palladium, a
precious metal which is part of the platinum group 'family' and is used by
the electrical and dental industries and by car catalyst producers. Russia
is the world's biggest supplier of palladium.
The price rally, which has taken the palladium from Dollars 98 a troy ounce
to last night's Dollars 112.50 in London - a 28-month peak - was started by
private speculators in Tokyo. One trader suggested: 'Someone is squeezing
the hell out of the market. If this was one of the London Metal Exchange
metals, someone would be having his knuckles rapped for doing some naughty
manipulation.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Short sterling steady
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDICATIONS from the UK government that it is unlikely to sanction a cut in
interest rates soon helped to brake an early rise in short sterling, writes
Peter John.
That rise was sparked by a larger than anticipated fall in the headline
inflation rate. This fell last month to 3 per cent from 3.6 per cent in
October, suggesting that there might be room for manoeuvre on base rates.
However, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the head of the Bundesbank was once again
stressing his commitment to current German interest rates and the UK
chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, was said to be seeking to lower hopes of a
fresh base rate cut.
Consequently, a rally by March short sterling from the 93.38 opening level
to 93.53 was cut back and the contract closed only 8 higher at 93.46.
The Bank of England operations continued to be hampered by unwillingness by
the clearing banks to take up the January 5 repo which would leave them with
an unwanted amount of cash over the Christmas and New Year period. The
clearers found better value in overnight money which was pushed up to about
8 per cent before easing towards the close as the central bank shortage was
taken out.
The unwillingness to carry money over was compounded by the continuing trend
to close up positions ahead of the Christmas break. One dealer said; 'The
will just isn't there at the moment.'
The Bank of England offered an early round of assistance after forecasting a
liquidity shortage of around Pounds 1.65bn, later revised to Pounds 1.6bn.
The Bank provided Pounds 465m of early assistance, buying band and band two
bank bills, both at the established 6 7/8 per cent rate.
It also purchased Pounds 400m of bills for resale on January 11 at 6 15/16
per cent. The Bank provided a further Pounds 155m in the morning, buying
band one bank bills at the 6 7/8 per cent rate.
In the afternoon, the Bank provided Pounds 544m bringing help to Pounds
1.164bn. It bought Pounds 367m of band one bank bills and Pounds 177m of
band two bank bills, both at the established 6 7/8 per cent rate.
Despite Pounds 240m of late, unspecified assistance, Pounds 196m of the
liquidity shortage was not taken out and dealers expected short money rates
to continue their tight trend next week.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: ERM strains highlighted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WEAKNESS within the European exchange rate mechanism was highlighted
yesterday. The Bundesbank was forced to intervene to support the franc, the
Belgian and Dutch central banks helped to prop up the Danish krone and the
Irish punt looked extremely vulnerable writes Peter John.
The Bundesbank intervened three times to prop up the franc, once during
European trading, once at the afternoon fixing and again in the aftermarket.
The bank also publicly announced that it had been buying selling D-Marks to
buy francs, thus lending additional moral support. This was compounded by a
statement from Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister that there was
'no need' to devalue the franc. The Bank of France was also intervening
Nevertheless, the franc slid to finish FFr3.418 against the D-Mark, down
from FFr3.413 on Thursday. Yesterday's close was the lowest since shortly
after the European currency crisis of mid-September and within 1.2 centimes
of its ERM floor against the D-Mark of FFr3.4305.
Even analysts who believe there will be no devaluation because of the
fundamental strength of the French economy were concerned. Mr Brian
Hilliard, economist with the French-owned bank Societe Generale Strauss
Turnbull said: 'Trading is very thin at the moment so you get more banks for
your franc. I am surprised that the central banks have not been more
aggressive.'
More bearish economists such as Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank are convinced
that devaluation is on the cards. 'We are seeing a drying of liquidity in
the market and there is an increasing feeling that the French will not be
able to resist either devaluation, flotation of the currency or a temporary
suspension from the ERM'
Mr MacKinnon believes there is a risk of 'meltdown in the current structure
of the ERM'. The view was taking hold that Ireland would be forced to
devalue very shortly.
Yesterday, Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, attempted to calm
the fears by stating that he ruled out devaluation.
Dealers added that Danish companies were heavy sellers of the Danish krone.
They said corporate selling had been the signal for the recent devaluation
of the Swiss franc.
The problems in Europe overshadowed the performance of the dollar. Also, a
severe blizzard in the US threatened to immobilise the New York financial
market and ensured that once again positive economic news had little impact.
The dollar was steady against the D-Mark at DM1.5765 but slightly firmer
against the pound and Yen.

FT  12 DEC 92 / International Company News: Pacific Telesis to spin off
wireless unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PACIFIC Telesis, the California-based local telephone company, yesterday
announced plans to spin off its wireless communications business in the
boldest move yet by one of the 'Baby Bell' telephone companies to cope with
increasing competition in the US telecommunications industry.
The decision, announced following a special board meeting in San Francisco,
means that the wireless business, one of the largest cellular telephone
operators in the US, will become totally independent from the local
telephone business, which serves most of California and parts of Nevada. The
wireless business also has significant interests in Germany, France and
other European markets.
Mr Sam Ginn, chairman, said the spin-off would enhance shareholder value by
creating separate, publicly traded companies able to react quickly to
changes in the telecommunications market.
It would also eliminate many of the financial, legal and regulatory
restraints to the group's growth.
Pacific Telesis is one of the seven ' Baby Bell' regional telephone
companies spun off in 1984 from AT&amp;T under a court-ordered break-up of the
group.
The Baby Bells face increasing competition from independent
telecommunications companies serving business clients, while themselves
remaining subject to heavy local regulation.

ANL, the Australian government-owned shipping line, slumped into the red in
1991-1992, turning a ADollars 9.2m (USDollars 6.3m) profit into an ADollars
8.9m loss.
The company, which is restructuring ahead of probable privatisation, is
omitting its dividend after sales fell to ADollars 592m from ADollars 619m.
Mr Bill Bolitho, chairman, said the company's lacklustre trading profits
were exacerbated by the recession, undercapitalisation, high interest
charges and substantial costs incurred in preparing for privatisation.

SWEDEN's banking system took another blow when Standard &amp; Poor's, the US
agency, downgraded the short-term debt ratings of Swedbank, the savings bank
group.
Swedbank's Eurocommercial paper and certificates of deposit ratings,
together with Swedbank Inc's US CP rating, were cut to A-2 from A-1. S&amp;P
said the move reflected 'a rapid and severe weakening of asset quality
within certain of the 11 Swedish saving banks which will merge with Swedbank
on January 1, forming Sparbanken Sverige group'.

FT  12 DEC 92 / International Company News: IBM investors intensify pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM is coming under increasing pressure from large shareholder groups to
take action to improve its dismal financial performance. The US computer
giant is understood to be planning a special board meeting next week to
address the shareholders' concerns.
The California Public Employees Pension System, known as Calpers, is
believed to be seeking a meeting with IBM's outside directors to discuss the
company's difficulties. Calpers is one of IBM's largest shareholders.
IBM said that it has engaged in some correspondence with Calpers, and that
within the past two months Mr John Akers, IBM chairman and chief executive,
had met Mr Dale Hanson, Calpers' chief executive, to discuss the company's
situation.
IBM officials declined to comment, however, on whether the company's board
will hold a special meeting next week. Neither would they comment on whether
Calpers has requested a meeting with outside directors.
Calpers has been instrumental in forcing the boards of directors of several
large corporations to deal with financial problems. The pension fund was one
of several shareholder groups that put pressure on Westinghouse to reform
its corporate governance rules and on Sears Roebuck to restructure its
operations.
If Calpers meets IBM's outside directors it would suggest that the pension
fund investors are dissatisfied with IBM management's handling of the
company's financial problems. It could also signal an effort to displace Mr
Akers.
However, Mr Akers has so far retained the strong support of IBM's board
members, including outside directors, and his position appears to be secure.
He is expected to retire at the end of 1994 when he reached IBM's
traditional retirement age of 60, and there are no obvious candidates within
IBM's ranks to replace him sooner than that.
Institutional investors have, however, been pushing IBM to consider dropping
its 'full employment' policy, under which the company has so far avoided
involuntary layoffs throughout a massive reduction of its workforce,
including 40,000 planned job cuts this year through voluntary early
retirement schemes.
Mr Akers, who has resisted layoffs in the past, said a year ago that the
company's full employment practice could continue only if the prosperity of
the company improved.
Wall Street analysts expect IBM to announce further cuts, of up to about
30,000 people, and take a large charge against earnings. Some have also
suggested that IBM may be forced to cut its dividend. Mr John Jones of
Salomon Brothers said earlier this week that he sees a 50 per cent chance of
IBM halving the dividend.
There is also rising speculation that IBM may be forced to consolidate its
mainframe computer operations.

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: NFC's logistic success set to survive
pension fund glitch - The company's record is strong
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY ANGUS FOSTER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Companies announcing results when their shares are touching an all-time high
are prone to accidents. NFC, the transport and logistics company that
changed its name from National Freight Consortium, learnt this lesson on
Wednesday.
NFC's 3 per cent profits decline to Pounds 91m for the year to October 3 was
expected, given recession in its main markets. But a much higher than
expected Pounds 14.5m pension fund credit led some analysts to question the
company's real underlying earnings growth.
'NFC is a very high quality company with one of the best managements in the
marketplace,' according to Mr Ian Wild of BZW. 'Over the long term it should
realise quite a lot of potential. The worry is whether it realises its full
potential,' he said.
The shares, which stood at 284p before the announcement, have been slipping
ever since and closed yesterday at 256p.
Mr James Watson, chairman, admitted the company had not 'done our PR very
well'. 'It was the surprise of it and we've got to say we're sorry,' he
said. But he rejected suggestions about the quality of the company's
earnings.
He said most of the pension credit was taken in NFC's transport division,
where it was almost cancelled out by restructuring costs. The incident was
unfortunate, and probably accelerated an overdue bout of profit-taking.
But it does not raise doubts about more significant, longer term changes at
NFC - its success within logistics and moves overseas.
NFC has developed rapidly since its Pounds 53.5m employee-led buy out from
the government in 1982. The previously dominant transport division, which
offered vehicle hire and transport services through BRS and Lynx, has been
overtaken in terms of profits and employees by logistics, which provides
warehousing and distribution services under the Exel name to retailers and
manufacturers.
Meanwhile, NFC is losing its reputation as a bell-wether for the UK economy.
Some of its businesses, like truck hire and Allied Pickford home removals,
will always be quick into and out of recession. But revenues from long-term
contracts, less exposed to the economic cycle, have almost doubled, to about
55 per cent.
As NFC has moved into the US and continental Europe, overseas earnings have
risen from almost nothing to nearly 40 per cent. Mr Watson is convinced this
growth can continue. Logistics services are more developed in the UK than
elsewhere, partly because of deregulation and partly because big food
retailers like Sainsbury and Tesco, two of NFC's biggest clients, moved to
'just-in-time' delivery and contracted out distribution.
Although the process started with food retailers, NFC now provides logistics
and warehousing services to non-food retailers, including Marks and Spencer
and manufacturers, such as Ford.
Mr Watson estimated that in the UK about 50 per cent of the distribution and
logistics market had been contracted to specialists. In the US and
continental Europe, the figure is closer 10 per cent. NFC is targeting these
markets, and spent Pounds 75m last year buying companies and infrastructure.
'Our belief is that the revolution we have seen here in the UK will also
happen in Europe and the US,' Mr Watson said.
Operating profits from logistics reached Pounds 46.8m last year, compared
with Pounds 31.5m two years ago. Investment in the US and Spain is largely
complete, although NFC remains weak in other European markets, such as
Germany.
Profits from the US dipped Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 26m last year, mainly due
to one-off reorganisation costs. This compared with profits of Pounds 72.7m
in the UK. But the difference is set to narrow, especially if the US
recovery continues and the UK remains flat. 'I would be very disappointed if
we didn't see a very significant increase in US profitability this year,' Mr
Watson said.
Attention has now turned to Europe, although NFC is unlikely to spend as
much this year as last on new ventures. A sharp rise in gearing from 29 per
cent to 55 per cent unnerved some analysts. But NFC employees still hold 45
per cent of the shares, making a rights issue difficult.
This suggests gearing will remain high, although interest cover is
comfortable at 12.2 times.
The company usually gives 'best views' on future profits at its annual
meetings in February. Until then, analysts are pencilling in profits of
Pounds 100m. Some argue that the pension credit and gearing questions will
overshadow the shares further, to about 240p before recovery.
But institutions are often underweight in NFC because of the high proportion
of employee shareholders. Some institutions may decide last week's share
price fall provides a buying opportunity. 'The shares are still not cheap,
but after this week's correction they are a strong hold,' one stockbroker
said.

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Thames settles movie rights row with ITV
Association
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES TELEVISION and the ITV Association yesterday reached an out-of-court
settlement in their row over film rights.
Under the deal, Carlton Television, which takes over the London weekday ITV
licence from Thames on January 1, will pay a total of Pounds 13.1m for the
right to show several hundred films in the London area.
Thames will get Pounds 8.5m on January 1 and Carlton will also take on
liabilities of Dollars 7.27m (Pounds 4.78m) for film rights bought but not
yet paid for.
Before yesterday's settlement - just before a High Court case was due to be
heard - Carlton had offered a total of Pounds 6.8m, including liabilities.
Thames issued writs against the ITV Association after the television trade
body decided that film rights were bought collectively by the ITV system and
could not be retained by Thames when it was no longer an ITV company.
The ITV Association said it was removing Thames rights over the films and
only giving it use of the films until the end of December. ITV also claimed
the right to arbitrate on any compensation for Thames.
Yesterday's agreement left both sides happy. The deal was Pounds 3.5m more
than the Thames book value of the rights and Carlton had budgeted a higher
amount.
As a result, several hundred films will not be available to Thames to show
on Channel 5 if the Independent Television Commission decides the new
channel should go ahead.
Thames, its parent Thorn EMI and Time Warner have effectively underwritten
70 per cent of the financing of the Pounds 150m venture. A number of other
potential shareholders, including Pearson, owner of the Financial Times and
Cox, the large US media group, have also written to the ITC saying they are
interested in investing.
The ITC will decide on Thursday whether or not the Thames-led bid - the only
one to be submitted - has passed the quality threshold on financing and
programme plans.

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Howden shares rise 7p after MT settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Howden Group rose 7p to 58p after the Glasgow-based engineering
group finally announced settlement of a long-running dispute over tunnelling
machines it supplied to Denmark.
MT Group, the international consortium responsible for building twin rail
tunnels under the Great Belt Straits in Denmark, has agreed to pay Howden a
total of Pounds 7.3m by June 30. Howden could also earn a further Pounds 1m
from a bonus scheme.
This payment ends a bitter wrangle with MT Group which has caused Howden
heavy losses, a crash in its share price and last year forced the group into
a Pounds 30m rights issue to rebuild its balance sheet.
Howden said the amounts receivable under this settlement were less than the
debtor amount currently carried on the group's balance sheet, and there
would therefore be an exceptional charge of not more than Pounds 2.5m
against profits in the year to April 30.
Mr Konrad Johnsen, Howden's chief executive, said: 'This agreement is good
news for Howden - it enhances cash flow, it removes the uncertainty and
potentially large costs associated with major legal actions and it releases
valuable management resources to enable us to concentrate fully on the
day-to-day running of the businesses.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Wassall puts pressure on Evode
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WASSALL, the mini-conglomerate that has made a Pounds 94.3m hostile bid for
Evode, yesterday said the chemical group was close to breaching a further
covenant which could trigger immediate redemption of its Dollars 43m (Pounds
28m) US redeemable shares.
Evode has already admitted it had been in breach of its interest covenants
relating to the Dollars 43m unlisted US redeemable shares since March 1991.
But it argues that the breach is of no concern because shareholders had
waived their rights, from the breach of covenants, to appoint a director to
Evode's board. In a document sent to Evode's shareholders, Wassall said the
company was in danger of breaching a further covenant that would allow
holders of the US redeemable preference shares to demand immediate
repayment.
Evode said it was close to breaching another covenant but only because of
the change in accounting rules. It said it was confident of modifying the
covenants with the two US preference shareholders, US West, one of the US
'baby Bell' telecommunications companies, and GE Capital.
Wassall said Evode was the worst performing manufacturing company out of 12
chemical groups.
Mr Andrew Simon, Evode's chairman, said Wassall's figures were misleading
and that the recent 40 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the 53 weeks
to October 3, from Pounds 7.3m to Pounds 10.2m, underlined the argument that
Wassall's 80p a share offer undervalued the company. Evode's shares fell 2p
to close at 94p.

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Small pay cut for Lord Hanson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD HANSON, the chairman of Hanson, the Anglo-American industrial
conglomerate, has taken a small pay cut. His remuneration fell from Pounds
1.38m to Pounds 1.35m according to the company's annual report.
In his statement Lord Hanson took a swipe at the Cadbury Committee on
corporate governance. He said: 'Much has been said recently about corporate
governance but most of the advice has been long on accountability and short
on encouraging efficiency and enterprise.'
He said the group's directors and associates held 17m shares, 0.4 per cent
of the share capital, between them, an average of half a million each.
However, Lord Hanson holds 6m shares himself and Mr Robert Hanson, his son
and also a director, holds 3.75m shares. The total holding is worth about
Pounds 40m at yesterday's close of 223 1/4 p, down from 226p.
The accounts also show that Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson's US
operations, could receive 14.4 per cent of an annual fee of Dollars 1.1m
(Pounds 720,000) relating to his personal holding in MariFarms, a 46.8 per
cent owned associate of Hanson.
After the September 30 year end MariFarms bought Marine Harvest, Unilever's
Scottish fish farming business, for Dollars 39m. This was financed by a
Dollars 31.8m private placement of preferred stock issued to Prudential
Insurance of America. Prudential has the right to sell the preferred stock
back to Hanson and Mr Clarke if MariFarms fails to redeem the stock by
October 31 1995. The annual fee will be paid as long as the put option is
unexercised.
The accounts also show that Hanson made charitable donations of Pounds
721,000 in the UK, down from Pounds 786,000, included in a worldwide total
of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 1.8m), less than 0.2 per cent of pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.29bn (Pounds 1.32bn). One project Hanson supported was St
Tiggywinkle's Wildlife Hospital Trust, where Hanson donated the materials to
build a wildlife teaching hospital.
Donations of Pounds 100,000 to the Conservative Party and Pounds 15,000 to
the Centre for Policy Studies were unchanged.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mining &amp; Allied Supplies saw its pre-tax profit fall substantially from
Pounds 281,000 to Pounds 41,000 in the year ended September 30 1992, but
there were some signs of improvement.
Mr Daniel Slabbert said he believed the increased level of sales experienced
over the last two months was an indication that the worst was now past.
Price rises by principal manufacturers of products distributed by the group
could lead to increased profitability, he added.
Anti-Friction Components, the distributor of bearing and power transmission
components acquired in September, will form the cornerstone of growth in the
UK in 1993.
After a tax credit, earnings per share were unchanged at 0.5p, and those are
wholly distributed as a maintained dividend. Extraordinary charges of Pounds
150,000 represented the closing of the fabrication division.

As a result, from turnover increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 762,600

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Core business behind 10% rise at IWP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IWP Group, the Dublin-based industrial holding company, increased profits by
10 per cent in the six months ended September 30.
The pre-tax line moved up from IPounds 3.9m to IPounds 4.31m (Pounds 4.62m),
generated on turnover 4.5 per cent ahead from IPounds 44.4m to IPounds
46.4m.
Mr Joe Moran, chairman, said depressed markets continued to create problems
for the group's businesses, but its household products division, which
comprised the core of the group, had been trading 'very satisfactorily'.
The result for the small telecommunications division 'is disappointing' he
said.
Earnings per share advanced to 11.35p (10.3p) and the interim dividend is 3p
(2.75p).

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Big improvement for Parkland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Parkland Textile, the woollen yarn, worsted cloth and clothing manufacturer,
broke even at the trading level in the six months to August 28 but incurred
a loss of Pounds 309,000 pre-tax after exceptional costs.
However, that was a substantial reduction on the Pounds 1.37m loss incurred
for the comparable period. Losses per share were 4.8p (13.4p) and the
interim dividend is again 1p.
Turnover rose nearly 23 per cent to Pounds 30.2m. That was a considerable
improvement over the last two years but margins were still under pressure as
a result of the poor retail marketplace, said Mr Denis Greenwood, chairman.
Exceptional costs of Pounds 317,000 related to reorganisation of the garment
division on to two sites.

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Carr's Milling in profit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH ALL trading sectors performing better, Carr's Milling Industries
returned to pre-tax profits for the year ended August 29, making Pounds
277,000, against a loss of Pounds 228,000.
The profit was struck after rationalisation costs of Pounds 237,000 in the
baking division. Below the line there were extraordinary charges of Pounds
405,000 covering a decision to withdraw from the loss-making egg production
and packing business, which will be completed within the next few months.
Turnover rose to Pounds 70.8m (Pounds 68.9m) and included Pounds 2.6m from
egg production and packing.
Earnings per share were 2.6p (losses 1.2p) and the final dividend is 2.9p
for a maintained total of 3.9p.

Hillsdown Holdings, the food group which has been retreating from its

The buyer is Cauval Industrie, a French group. Hillsdown made a profit on
the sale, the cash consideration of Pounds 17m exceeding the net asset value
of Pounds 14m.
Mr David Newton, chief operating officer, said: 'This is another significant
step in the process of concentrating our interests on core activities.'
In 1991 the non-food activities contributed 16 per cent of group operating

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Pure genius needed to maintain growth - The
problems faced by Guinness in a changing market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS'S slipping growth rate this year has aroused the sort of alarm with
which a character in one of its old advertisements watched his glass of
stout slide down the neck of an ostrich.
A comment this week about the testing prospects for 1993 by Mr Tony Greener,
chief executive and chairman-elect, compounded already gloomy expectations
this year.
Guinness shares tumbled 9 per cent and analysts downgraded forecasts,
predicting a 4 per cent fall in 1992 profits.
To some City observers, the setback is more significant than a simple
reflection of the impact of recession on the international drinks group's
most profitable markets. They consider it suggests that the sources of
organic profit growth are running dry after a compound growth rate of more
than 23 per cent a year since 1987.
Guinness's five-year performance under Sir Anthony Tennant, who retires at
the end of this month, is almost worth a place in its own book of records.
Profits soared from Pounds 408m to Pounds 956m while earnings per share and
dividends doubled. Market capitalisation rose from Pounds 2.8bn to Pounds
10.9bn as its shares outperformed the rest of the FT-SE 100 companies.
The platform for the launch of this spectacular display was the acquisition
of Distillers Company in 1986. DCL's huge brand assets, including Johnnie
Walker, White Horse and Dewar's Scotch whisky and Gordon's gin, had been
under-exploited.
There was immense scope for rationalisation of production and distribution
and significant rewards to be earned from implementing a cohesive marketing
strategy.
The opportunities were seized. Operating management was reorganised and
focused on regional markets. Control over distribution was increased from 25
per cent to 85 per cent through acquisitions and joint ventures. Brand
portfolios were rationalised, and brands pushed up-market with hefty price
increases, redesigned packaging and new-look advertising.
More than a score of peripheral businesses were sold to concentrate
resources on the core spirits and beer activities.
Spirits, particularly Scotch whisky, with margins of more than 30 per cent,
now account for 76 per cent of profits.
But having squeezed so much value out of DCL some analysts have been
questioning whether Guinness can sustain its profits growth.
Volumes are declining in the US and UK, the largest Scotch markets. A
premium pricing policy will be more difficult to pursue as global inflation
rates fall. Consumers in developed countries are becoming more value
conscious and less susceptible to aspirational advertising.
'In the largest global spirit markets, it could be the demise of the de-luxe
decade,' said Mr David Thompson, analyst at Kleinwort Benson.
Nor can the brewing division be expected to compensate with a substantial
boost to its 24 per cent contribution to group profits. 'Margins are already
high by comparison with brewing companies generally,' he added.
Mr Greener, who carried out the restructuring of the spirits business, said:
'It is quite clear that we are not going to get the sort of profit growth
that we have had in the past five years.' But that, he added, 'is a
reflection on the state of the world economy not of the company'.
Guinness, in his view, is positioned for a long run of consistent profits
growth which worldwide recession has only temporarily interrupted.
Ms Michelle Proud, analyst at County NatWest, agreed: 'We believe that
growth will resume in 18 months or so, possibly even sooner, with the pace
accelerating within a year or so, thereafter to a sustainable rate of 8 per
cent to 10 per cent above the underlying rate of inflation.'
The case against the pessimists rests firmly on the belief that trading-up
is a basic human instinct. 'Wherever people become better off, they will
spend to improve their standard of living, their way of life,' said Mr
Greener, 'and they will want to demonstrate their achievements to their
peers.
'Recession may affect the rate at which people spend, but it does not put an
end to their aspirations.' Guinness's long-term growth would depend, he
added, on its ability to persuade spirits and beer consumers to continue to
trade up to its premium brands.
It has a geographical spread of markets which minimises the effects of
recession and multiplies the opportunities. It earns 30 per cent of its
profits in continental Europe, 21 per cent in Asia/Pacific, 18 per cent in
North America, 16 per cent in the UK and 15 per cent in the rest of the
world.
There are ample financial resources to extend the range of the group's
distribution and expand its drinks portfolio. About Pounds 2.5m, of which
half has been internally generated, has already been spent on establishing
its alliance with LVMH, the French champagne and cognac group; and on
acquiring such brands and sales networks as IW Harper bourbon and Scoresby
Scotch in the US, Asbach brandy in Germany, Bundaberg rum in Australia, and
Pampero rum in Venezuela.
'But it would take a very big acquisition to shift the profits needle
significantly,' Mr Greener said, 'and such opportunities are limited.
'It is the organic growth of our international brands that will drive us
forward. The ultimate test for us is the management of our brand marketing.'
Guinness has put together a largely new management team for the task. Of 31
operational directors, only 10 were with the company in 1986, and only three
are doing roughly the same jobs.
But they are internationally experienced, and they have a marketing budget,
estimated at Pounds 400m a year, for strengthening their already formidable
brands. In declining spirits markets, such as the recession-hit US and UK,
the group has gained market share and sustained high margins. 'Strong brands
always emerge from recession even stronger,' says Mr Greener. 'It is the
weak brands that give way.'
In fast-emerging growth markets such as Venezuela, Brazil and Mexico; in
Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan; in Greece and Portugal; Guinness's spirits
brands lead the premium and de-luxe sectors.
Targeted advertising and promotion encourages consumer aspiration. Brands
positioned at successively higher price points offer opportunities to fulfil
them step by step.
Thus the Johnnie Walker brand - the world's best-selling Scotch which
accounts for 40 per cent of Guinness's profits - has been extended to cover
a duty-free price range of Dollars 10 to Dollars 225 a bottle.
Trading up from two bottles of Johnnie Walker Red to a bottle of Johnnie
Walker Black, according to Ms Proud, represents a 24 per cent increase in
profit.
'Building brands, ensuring they remain relevant to the consumer, is a
progressive, cumulative exercise,' said Mr Greener. 'It takes time, but we
shall be doing it better five years from now and I see no reason why we
should not achieve relatively strong rates of growth.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: PPI creditors given hope of 10% return
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of Polly Peck International could recover 10 per cent of their
loans following the sale of the subsidiary, Del Monte Fresh Produce.
However, administrators have also warned that a dispute over how funds were
routed could mean that creditors receive only 4p in the pound, or even
nothing
This range of forecasts comes in the latest six-monthly report to creditors
by Polly Peck's administrators, Coopers and Lybrand. The figures do not take
account of any possible recoveries by joint administrator Touche Ross, which
is suing various parties on Polly Peck's behalf.
Polly Peck, the fruit, electronics and leisure conglomerate, collapsed with
debts of Pounds 1.3bn in October 1990. The sale in August this year of its
Del Monte subsidiary to a group of Mexican investors represented the best
chance for the creditors of receiving a significant payment.
A total of Dollars 218m remained after repayment of a bank syndicate that
financed the acquisition of Del Monte But administrators are uncertain
whether a Polly Peck subsidiary was used to route funds for the original Del
Monte acquisition.
If acquisition funds passed through Polly Peck Finance a group of 11 banks
stood to gain as principal creditors of this subsidiary, the report said.
This routing of funds would mean creditors of the parent would receive 4p in
the pound. But if the funds did not pass through Polly Peck Finance general
creditors could get 10p in the pound.
However, the report said there was a further claim against the Del Monte
proceeds Holders of Dollars 110m of preference shares issued by Polly Peck
Finance NV claim they rank senior to other creditors and should be fully
repaid with interest, before other creditors. The administrators said they
had been advised that preference holders rank equally with other creditors.

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Intangibles boost Lonrho
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO'S profits for the year to the end of September 1992 were
substantially boosted by a change in accounting policy on intangibles, a
document to shareholders shows.
According to a circular issued by Lonrho yesterday on its proposed rights
issue, its estimated net profit last year was Pounds 82m. Of this, Pounds
76m was made up of extraordinary profits, consisting of Pounds 150m from the
sale of assets less losses on disposals and closure costs.
Lonrho has retrospectively written off the intangible value of its newspaper
titles, consisting of the Herald and Evening Times in Glasgow and the
Observer. The Glasgow papers, sold during the year for Pounds 75m, had an
estimated intangible value of Pounds 50m. Without the accounting change, net
profits would thus have been reduced to about Pounds 32m, compared with a
dividend payment of Pounds 27m.
Net asset value per share at the end of the year was shown at 157p after the
write-off of intangibles. Lonrho states that a full take-up of the proposed
Pounds 164m rights issue, together with the Pounds 124m from the sale of the
VAG motor subsidiary to Volkswagen, would reduce net asset value to 146p.

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: AF Budge put into receivership by banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AF BUDGE, the privately owned construction group and the sixth largest road
builder in Britain, has been put into receivership by its bankers, writes
Paul Taylor.
Mr Tony Budge, chairman of the group which has an annual turnover of Pounds
150m, said the banks' decision had come as a surprise. 'What we needed was
some confidence and the sun to shine, instead of that we ran into a brick
wall,' he said.
Although the group had suffered as a result of the slump in the construction
sector, and had to carry the burden of an unlet office block in London's
Docklands costing Pounds 6m a year, Mr Budge said: 'We thought we could see
clear water for the first time.'
The group had used the proceeds from the management buy-out of its open-cast
coal mining division earlier this year to repay Pounds 11m of subordinated
debt and bank loans, including a Pounds 35m unsecured loan from Barclays.
The latter was replaced by a Pounds 20m loan facility provided by a
syndicate of three banks, including Barclays. The group had reached the
limit of this borrowing facility, but Mr Budge said the two institutional
shareholders, Charterhouse and Prudential, had made new proposals to the
syndicate.
However, it appears the banks could not agree on the proposal. As a result
Coopers &amp; Lybrand partners were appointed as receivers by County NatWest,
acting as agent for the syndicate, which also included the Royal Bank of
Scotland.
Budge was due to sponsor today's big National Hunt horse race at Cheltenham.
But Mr Tony Budge, who is a member of the Jockey Club, decided to end his
connections with the sport after the receivers were called on Thursday.
Mr George Ward, of Grunwick, has stepped in to sponsor the race, which will
be known as the Tripleprint Gold Cup.

FT  12 DEC 92 / UK Company News: Vulnerable rating angers insurance
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE INSURANCE companies have reacted with anger to a report by Standard &amp;
Poor's, the international credit-rating agency, which classified four of
them as 'vulnerable'.
Actuaries and analysts generally supported its broad conclusions that
financial strength had declined considerably over the last five years of
poor market performance, and that solvency levels were likely to remain low.
But many attacked S&amp;P's attempt to classify companies' claims-paying ability
into three categories of 'good', 'adequate', and 'poor' on the basis only of
published information. Actuaries said the task was impossible without a
detailed actuarial investigation, and that differences in accounting and
valuation policies had been ignored.
The four companies with the vulnerable rating, which all of them contest,
were:
Guardian Assurance, a subsidiary of Guardian Royal Exchange and the only
UK-quoted company affected. GRE said that S&amp;P had failed to take into
account the fact that the company had stopped offering 'with-profits'
contracts, which require strong reserves, and that it should now be regarded
as a 'unit-linked' office.
National Provident Institution, a mutual office which concentrates on
'with-profits' business, and relies mainly on independent financial advisers
for its business. NPI was the first to react. By 10 o'clock yesterday
morning it reported that its London office alone had received 20 calls
asking to surrender policies following the S&amp;P survey.
Mr Bernard Brindley, its chief actuary, pointed out that its conservative
valuation basis had been ignored and that it retained a 65 per cent holding
in equities, in the region of the industry average and allowing it room to
increase financial strength by switching into fixed interest securities.
Prolific Life &amp; Pensions, which is owned by Hafnia, the Danish insurance
company, and is in negotiations to be acquired by Scottish Provident, the
mutual life assurance group. Prolific said the statement that 50 per cent of
its policies lapsed before maturing was misleading, and that the true figure
was 17 per cent.
Windsor Life, now a subsidiary of New York Life, said the report was based
on 'out-of-date information'. It said it had not been consulted by S&amp;P
before the report was published, and expected to discuss and then contest
the rating with S&amp;P.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Going to Market' (December 1), links the UK's emphasis on
equity rather than debt finance with the UK's 'infrastructure devoted to
bringing firms to market - accountants, merchant banks, stockbrokers'.
This is a perceptive commentary but does not do justice to the UK's thriving
management consultancy industry which is devoted to getting the best mix of
finance for its clients rather than just placing equity. In one of our
recent projects, a mixed team of financial and telecommunications
specialists arranged financing for an east European country's national
telecommunications infrastructure development. No equity finance was
involved, only a start-up loan equivalent to 1 per cent of the country's
annual gross domestic product.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: Tecs at forefront of displaying flexibility in
supporting business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr CHRIS HUMPHRIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Charles Batchelor's refreshing article on academic recognition of the
need to support established business ('Thinking the unthinkable', December
8) quite rightly highlighted the plan for a network of business advice
centres ('one-stop shops') as indicative of changing government priorities.
This change is good news for business; yet I fear the article gives the
impression that this is something new for the Training and Enterprise
Councils. In reality Tecs have long been aware of the need to encourage
international competitiveness in business of all types and stages of growth;
the new moves from the Department of Trade and Industry will help us do more
of it.
Tecs do have the flexibility to support start-up businesses; and the French
and German models your correspondent quoted would not be beyond the purse or
capability of any Tec. However, before we abandon the British start-up model
completely, we would be wise to remember that Britain's system excites
international (not just European) interest. Only last week, a delegation of
'business incubator' managers from Israel came to Hertfordshire Tec to learn
more about our support for business, and their positive response was similar
to that we received in the staterooms of Brussels a few months ago. When
more than eight out of 10 businesses that start with our help are still
flourishing in spite of the current recession after their first 18 months,
something must be going right.
Many Tecs already provide a significant and growing level of support for
businesses that employ more than 20 people, and are between three and five
years old. Hertfordshire Tec's 'Business Masterclasses' were designed here
more than 18 months ago specifically to inject expertise into just this type
fo company. More than nine out of 10 delegates - senior managers and
managing directors of local firms - come from companies three years old or
more. Just less than half the companies employ 21 or more people. Other
established Hertfordshire businesses are enthusiastically tapping into Tec
services designed for growth or survival. Chris Humphries,

FT  12 DEC 92 / Opportunity knocks: The challenge awaiting Clinton's
economic team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may all end in tears. But in these early days it is hard to suppress a
sense of excitement about what the Clinton administration could achieve
economically.
The fact that the economic team was named first, ahead of foreign policy and
defence posts, sends a strong signal that economics matters. So does the
creation of an economic council within the White House of equal status to
the National Security Council. Mr Bill Clinton seems determined that his
administration never should not lose sight of the commercial and financial
implications of decisions. With the cold war over, he senses that the
principal challenges facing the US are now economic.
He has a unique opportunity for correcting many of the policy mistakes of
the past two decades. He inherits a promising economic outlook from
President George Bush. The economy, having grown sluggishly for six straight
quarters, now seems to be gathering momentum. Yet, thanks in part to the
cautious policies of Mr Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, for
the first time in a generation the US is also in striking distance of
re-establishing stable prices.
At the same time, after 12 years of budgetary gridlock in Washington, the
same party at last controls both White House and Congress. There is an
opportunity for action on many of the pressing problems facing the US, such
as the need to raise savings and reform health care. Congress, moreover,
appears to recognise the importance of addressing long-term structural
problems such as slow productivity growth.
One instant criticism of Mr Clinton's first round of economic appointments
was that it included only one professional economist - Ms Alice Rivlin, of
the Brookings Institution, who was named as deputy budget director. The two
most senior posts go to congressional deal-makers: Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
chairman of the Senate finance committee, who was named Treasury secretary,
and Mr Leon Panetta, the chairman of the House budget committee, who was
named budget director.
Wall Street investment banking was also well-represented with Mr Robert
Rubin, the co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, named to run the new White House
economic council, and Mr Roger Altman of the Blackstone Group, tapped as
deputy to Mr Bentsen at Treasury. Three of the four men - Messrs Bentsen,
Panetta and Rubin - are trained lawyers; Mr Altman has an MBA from the
University of Chicago.
Few industrialised nations put professional economists in top policymaking
positions. Mr Clinton has sensibly opted to put politicians in political
slots. If Mr Bentsen and Mr Panetta cannot get legislation through a
Democrat-controlled Congress, it is doubtful anybody can. Both are respected
on Capitol Hill, having been intimately involved in economic and budgetary
policymaking for over a decade.
Mr Rubin and Mr Altman are knowledgeable on economics and have the advantage
over academics of bringing real-world experience of the constraints that
financial markets can impose on even the best intentioned policies. Mr
Altman also has government experience having served at the Treasury in the
Carter administration.
These were, in any case, only the first economic appointments. Mr Clinton
yesterday named Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an economics professor at the
University of California at Berkeley, to head the Council of Economic
Advisers. His old friend, Mr Robert Reich, who lectures in political economy
at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, was named labor secretary. Other
important announcements, such as trade representative and commerce
secretary, will follow.
There is scope for some tension among members of Mr Clinton's team. Mr
Bentsen is likely to put greater emphasis on tax incentives for saving and
investment than would Mr Panetta and Ms Rivlin, both of whom have
reputations as deficit hawks. Mr Bentsen also has an unfortunate history of
regarding the tax system as a mechanism for rewarding individual sectors,
such as oil, gas and real estate. Once out of the Senate, however, he will
no longer face political pressure to put sectoral interests above national
ones.
But neither Mr Rubin nor Mr Altman have policy axes to grind; both seem
likely to serve as efficient implementers of administration policy. Mr
Rubin, in particular, is seen as playing a co-ordinating role in economic
policymaking analogous to that in foreign affairs of General Brent
Scowcroft, President George Bush's national security advisers.
What the senior appointees have in common is more important than what
divides them. They are all solidly in the political and economic mainstream;
they believe in market forces, free trade and responsible fiscal policies.
Fears that Mr Clinton would lurch to the left after the election thus appear
unfounded. Indeed, this week it was the liberal wing of the Democratic
Party, rather than Republicans, that voiced misgivings.
The team seems likely to establish amicable relations with the Federal
Reserve. Before the election Mr Clinton went out of his way to defend the
Fed's independence in monetary policy. He recently invited Mr Greenspan to
Little Rock to try to reach a mutual understanding on the economy.
But what, it may be asked, has this conventional team of moderates got to do
with the more radical ideas Mr Clinton outlined during the campaign? Are
these the people to 'rebuild' the American economy, to oversee large new
investments in education, training and infrastructure?
There are two possible answers. The first is that Mr Clinton is a politician
through and through. He said what he had to say to solidify Democratic
support and defeat Mr Bush. Now that he has won he will drop many of the
policies (and people) associated with the campaign.
A more charitable interpretation runs as follows. Mr Clinton has
conventional macroeconomic views and has always seen deficit reduction as
one of the keys to higher national savings and improved productivity growth.
He has thus named a macroeconomic team capable of reassuring financial
markets and pushing tough deficit reduction legislation through Congress.
But he has not forgotten the other, more radical part of his agenda. He does
want to transform industrial skill training, invest more heavily in
commercial research and development, and, perhaps, develop a more aggressive
industrial policy. The principal players here are likely to include Ms Tyson
at the CEA and Mr Reich at Labor. But by giving the most senior posts to
moderates such as Mr Bentsen, an advocate of free enterprise, who will
restore the Treasury's traditionally dominant role in economic policymaking,
Mr Clinton is ensuring that the interventionists will not gain the upper
hand.
Mr Clinton, moreover, stressed again this week that he remains the chief
economic decision taker. It will be his job to balance the conflicting
demands of different agencies and departments. And while the administration
has great opportunities to solve economic problems, it faces formidable
challenges, some of which reflect Mr Clinton's own inconsistent campaign
pledges.
Mr Clinton wants to increase spending significantly on education, training,
infrastructure and technology, reduce the burden of taxes on middle-income
families and sharply reduce the structural budget deficit. Even if he
manages to reduce the rate of growth of health care spending, he cannot
achieve all these goals simultaneously. The hard bargaining has yet to
begin.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Fresh splash of green: Signs of recovery in the art market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A painting by Matisse was sold at auction in New York last month for a
record Dollars 14.5m (Pounds 9.6m) and a Monet for Dollars 12.1m. This week
in Paris a Van Gogh fetched FFr55m (Pounds 6.5m). And in London on Wednesday
a Goya was bought by the Getty Museum of Malibu, California, for Pounds
4.95m. The international art market is suddenly sprouting green shoots after
more than two years of decline and despair.
Undoubtedly a revival of interest in acquiring art, generated in the US, is
restoring confidence to the auction houses of Paris and London, and to
hard-pressed antique dealers. But the revival is selective and fickle. At
best it might persuade owners of important works of art that they can now
consign them to auction with a good chance of making a sale; at worst it
marks the end of the recession, but with any general revival still in the
future.
The fall in the art market was sudden and sharp. The cracks were already
appearing at the New York auctions in May 1990 when a Japanese paper
manufacturer, Ryoei Saito, bought a Van Gogh portrait for Dollars 82.5m and
a Renoir music hall scene for Dollars 78.1m, by far the highest prices ever
paid for works of art. Alongside the records there were a disturbingly high
percentage of unsold lots. By the next round of important art sales in
London in December 1990 the fall in demand was apparent. Christie's auction
totalled Pounds 10.3m, compared with Pounds 76.5m a year earlier, while
Sotheby's only managed Pounds 6.6m as against Pounds 76m in December 1989.
The auction houses were hit hard. Sotheby's fell into loss, and Christie's
saw its profits fall sharply. But they had partly been responsible for
creating the heights from which the market fell. They offered guarantees to
important sellers and loans to prospective buyers, encouraging speculative
purchases, especially among the Japanese. The fastest growing market had
been for post-1870 art which quickly came to represent almost 50 per cent of
auction houses' turnover in the late 1980s.
The recent sprinkling of high prices reflects a very different market. Most
dealers have too much debt, and too many unsold works of art, to be big
buyers, and the Japanese are almost totally absent - except as sellers. But
new collectors are appearing, many of them Americans who think that the US
is moving out of recession and that art looks a better home for surplus
money compared with the low interest rates offered by the banks. The Matisse
went to a first-time buyer, as did the Monet.
To date the revival in the art market is concentrated on undoubted
masterpieces, which have an international appeal, and works of interest
specifically to American buyers. Sotheby's auction of American paintings
earlier this month was its best in this field for 2 1/2 years, totalling
Dollars 11m. Latin American art is even more buoyant, reflecting the
resilience of the regional economies such as Mexico and Venezuela. At
Sotheby's, a brothel scene by Colombian artist Fernando Botero went for
Dollars 1.54m in an auction which brought in more than Dollars 10m and was
90 per cent sold.
There are also encouraging bids coming from east Asia. The Japanese are
still licking their wounds but the Koreans, Taiwanese and some Hong Kong
Chinese are competing fiercely for Asian works of art. Contemporary Chinese
paintings represent a new market which is helping auction houses make good
some of their losses on the impressionists. Last month, a painting by Zhang
Daqian sold for more than Pounds 600,000.
Even the tricky area of contemporary art is looking up. This is one area
where American artists, in particular the abstract expressionists of the
post-1945 New York school such as Jackson Pollock and Jasper Johns, are
pre-eminent. This is the art sought by rich Americans, especially the new
rich. Charles Saatchi this month reckoned the market was strong enough to
absorb 14 works from his collection in New York. He was over-optimistic and
five were unsold but the most expensive, Andy Warhol's Marilyn X 100, found
a buyer at Dollars 3.74m. This was less than its estimate, and much less
than the Dollars 7m that Saatchi had been asking for it privately, but he
will have shown a profit on the picture. A work by Johns made Dollars 2.3m
and one by Pollock Dollars 1.98m. Both sold below estimate but at least the
owners, who probably paid comparatively little for the paintings in the
1970s, were prepared to risk exposing them at auction.
Prices for top quality impressionist and contemporary art have fallen by
about 40 per cent and are back to the levels of around 1988. But good
pictures now attract interest. In London an important Kandinsky abstract
made a solid Pounds 5.5m, the first time a modern work has broken the Pounds
5m barrier since the market collapsed. And although the first major work by
Francis Bacon to appear since his death was well below the Pounds 1m target,
its price of Pounds 735,000 would be regarded by many as fair. If sellers
are prepared to accept lower estimates on their works, there is now a
market.
But many owners are still chasing the prices of the late 1980s. This is
particularly true of British art, which is bought mainly by British
collectors and which mirrors the depressed state of the economy. A Turner
Venetian watercolour, which had set a record for an English watercolour of
Pounds 440,000 in 1988, was unsold last month, with bids failing to reach
Pounds 400,000.
Despite such setbacks, signs of an upturn in the art market are now reaching
the dealers and auction houses. In recent months, closures have become rarer
and trade is picking up.
The 17 dealers in London's Cork Street stayed open for a weekend last month
and enjoyed a high level of interest. One, Leslie Waddington, sold Pounds
250,000 worth of art; another, the Redfern, 20 works. The Bill Jackson
Gallery was visited by 2,000 people. Eskenazi, an oriental dealer, opened an
exhibition of rare Chinese lacquer on Monday and has already sold three
pieces to museums, with three more reserved.
Like the economy at large the art market's recovery is likely to be hesitant
and fitful. But as Christmas approaches, the mood is considerably more
cheerful than it has been for the past two years.

Sir, Mr Howard Jordan of Scottish Engineering (Letters, December 7) says
that he has been campaigning for better supervisory training 'for a number
of years now', and draws attention to its impor-tance.
The first conference to which I was sent by my company, in 1951, was on the
importance of training for first line supervisors. This was well attended
and was run by the then Industrial Welfare Society, which later dropped the
middle word in its title.
As Rudiger van Wechmar said in his adjoining letter about the EC, that was
41 years ago.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: Time to pay realistic price for non-executive
directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID DAWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The time has now come, following publication of the Cadbury committee
report, to realise that there is no such thing as a non-executive director.
The unified nature of the UK board was stressed in the report. The legal
fact is that all directors owe essentially the same duties to a company.
Given the additional responsibilities now heaped on NEDs, the commitment in
time required from them will surely mean that NEDs are, at the very least,
part-time directors.
At the heart of this comment is the rather infra dig but rather important
question of fees. These often vary with the size of an organisation but the
workload does not. And it will be those companies with the greatest need for
strong, experienced NEDs that are least likely to get them because of the
time commitment required.
I warmly endorse the committee's recommendation that a clear written
statement of the responsibilities of an NED should be drawn up on
appointment. I would further recommend a clear statement of the hours that
the NED will commit to the company. There should also be a clear statement
of the number of hours the NED will be required to commit to the training
recommended by the report. Those statements can then form the basis upon
which an adequate fee can be agreed.
Asking a minimum of 180 hours a year with an extra 90 hours for the first
year and 15 hours a year training, over a three-year contract a company
should probably be budgeting for a fee of between Pounds 32,000 and Pounds
63,000 a year for each non-executive. The actual fee would, of course,
depend on responsibilities assumed (for example, chairmanship of the audit
committee), and the calibre of the prospective NED. A fee of less than the
minimum suggested would not adequately compensate a top calibre professional
business person for the hours committed (opportunity cost) and the risk
taken. That said, it is a fact that the vast majority of NEDs are currently
paid significantly less than the suggested minimum, probably Pounds 12,000
to Pounds 20,000.
If, however, shareholders really want the protection afforded by
implementing the code they should be prepared to pay the price.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Letter: Beveridge: a more realistic view
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From D J TURKINGTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The memories of a Liverpool childhood for a 54-year-old give the debate
on Beveridge a touch of reality mixed with gratitude for the benefits his
efforts created.
John Gray's description ('Truth of the Matter', December 5) of the 1990s as
scarred by '. . .mass unemployment, pervasive squalor and rickety health
services. . .' annoys me. His words are a gross exaggeration of those
problems while they disregard the new problems developing from the breakdown
of family life and ethical standards. The visionaries of the 1990s will be
more accurate in their analysis.
If Mr Gray were to visit Teesside he would see what a well aimed swipe of
Mrs Thatcher's hand bag has achieved. Or is to be a Fellow of Jesus College
simply a licence to misuse truth every day?

Sir, Mr Bijan-Daniel Kherzri, commenting on the Swiss rejection of the
European Economic Area (Letters, December 9), states: 'It raises the
question whether Swiss direct democracy is practical at a time when
long-term structural decisions have to be taken which simply surpass the
comprehensive capabilities of the average masses.'
As a Swiss and a member of the 'average masses', I would like to quote
Winston Churchill, who said: 'Democracy is the worst form of government  -

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN MACLEAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Enough] The current bout of bank-bashing is now a bandwagon, upon which
business and the public are jumping to mitigate their own woes, and the
media to protect us all from the new 'bully'.
I beg to differ. I applaud my local branch of National Westminster. As a
self-employed bookseller in a small Welsh market town, I am hardly a large
'account', and the branch will earn little more from my modest transactions
this year than it has for the last eight since we opened.
But the manager is courteous, attentive and professional and responds
positively to any well-presented business idea. His staff give me the sort
of service I also try to employ. I do not find their charges other than
competitive, and their recently extended opening hours suit me fine.
If business is tough, look no further than the recession. If (heaven forbid)
my business failed, my bank would not be the prime cause. John MacLean,

FT  12 DEC 92 / Man in the news: Lead role in the Scottish play - Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shortly before 8 o'clock yesterday morning in Edinburgh, Mr Uffe
Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign minister, was in nostalgic mood as he
strode through the well-guarded gates of the Palace of Holyrood House, the
site of the EC summit.
The moustachioed 51-year-old minister recalled he had last been here nearly
40 years ago on a school exchange visit. 'It was my first European
experience. I first spoke English with a Scottish accent.' Yesterday at
daybreak, the palace appeared a lot smaller than in his boyhood memory.
'Everything looks bigger when you're a child.'
Mr Ellemann-Jensen hopes his second journey to the Scottish capital will
also prove memorable - but for different reasons, and on a much larger
scale. He is a pivotal figure in the EC's weary efforts to overcome the
obstacles created by Denmark's No to the Maastricht treaty in June.
The setback, combined with a general upsurge in strains over European
integration, has threatened for months to paralyse the European Community.
Last night, the problems seemed nearer resolution, even though the final
outcome will be decided only in a second Danish referendum, provisionally
planned for April or May.
As the result of complex negotiations both with other Danish political
parties and with the rest of the EC, Mr Ellemann-Jensen hopes to come up
with additions to the treaty fulfilling two vital aims. Amendments must
allay the doubts of Danish voters over European union, by allowing
exemptions in areas such as monetary union and common European defence.
But they must not upset other EC members firmly committed to
Maastricht-style integration. In particular, no country - especially
Britain, with its own ratification process still dragging on - wants to see
changes which would require Maastricht legislation to be resubmitted to
national parliaments.
'It's very difficult to have an agreement which is legally binding for us,
but which does not reopen the treaty,' said Mr Ellemann-Jensen yesterday.
'It looks impossible - but it will be done.'
June's No vote was an important setback for the leader of Denmark's Liberal
party, the minority partner in the centre-right coalition government. An
irrepressible pro-European, he campaigned energetically for a Yes. 'The
rejection was his greatest personal and political failure,' said a close
aide. 'But his greatest personal and political victory would be a Yes in a
new referendum next year.'
Mr Ellemann-Jensen admitted that the 'natural reaction' to the June No would
have been to resign his office. But he thought about it for only 20 seconds.
'Since all the major parties supported the Maastricht treaty, there was no
better alternative than for me to try to reverse the decision.'
His spirits have been lifted by the proposals by the British government,
currently chairing the EC, to find a way out of the impasse. Although doubts
remain over their precise legal status, the latest proposals yesterday won a
surprisingly positive reception from French President Francois Mitterrand.
He recognises he must find a delicate balance between securing changes
capable of winning a referendum majority, and testing other EC members'
patience by overplaying Denmark's objections to the treaty. One senior
German official warned yesterday: 'The Danes must not exaggerate.'
Mr Ellemann-Jensen admitted his discomfort with some aspects of recent
bargaining. When touring EC capitals in the past few weeks, 'I was sometimes
travelling with demands (for amendments to the treaty) with which I did not
agree'. He is playing for the highest stakes. He confirmed that, should a
new referendum result in another No, 'one way or the other we would have to
leave the Community'.
On the other hand, since the treaty cannot come into force unless it is
ratified by all EC members, Mr Ellemann-Jensen has powerful leverage to win
concessions. He does not take too seriously the threat that the other 10 EC
members, could go ahead with a new treaty without Denmark or the UK. 'This
would be very complicated. They would have to start all over again.'
Borrowing an analogy from the divorce court, he added: 'They would have to
fight over the children and the furniture.'
He believes that the No vote had triggered some positive debate. 'In some
ways it has been healthy that we had the shock of the Danish referendum at
an early stage. There was a fear that the Community was going ahead too
fast.' The new efforts to improve openness and democracy throughout the
Community owed much to the Danish 'early warning', he said.
However, he sees drawbacks as well as benefits in the Community's new
emphasis on 'subsidiarity' - making decisions at the lowest level of
government. 'You could use subsidiarity to undermine common policies in
areas like the environment.'
The minister concedes that this year's vicissitudes have made him more
cautious. Compared with the first referendum, his pro-Europe campaign for
the one next year is likely to be less high-profile.
By the time that Denmark takes over the rotating EC presidency at the
beginning of January, he hopes that the main Maastricht hurdles will have
been overcome - allowing the EC to direct more energy to tackling growing
chaos in the east of the continent.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen will spend a few days cod-fishing between Christmas and
the new year. In the first week of January, he plans to tour trouble spots
in the former Yugoslavia, turning his attention to a crisis where the EC has
so far shown itself impotent. With the EC's disarray still palpable, the
Danes will have to work hard simply to prevent it getting worse. But at
least Mr Ellemann-Jensen is promising that the style of the Danish
presidency will be as communautaire as possible.
'I have told my staff how important it is to look at our presidency not as
Danes, but in terms of the Community.' This is not simply a question of
principle: 'Otherwise everyone will be even more suspicious of us.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / Carmakers face game of chicken: Ford's price increases
highlight the tough choice between profits and sales volume in the UK car
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since the pound crashed out of the European exchange rate mechanism in
September, carmakers have agonised over how much and how quickly they could
raise prices in the UK to claw back their devaluation losses on imported
cars and parts.
In a sector laid low by recession the UK car market has been a desperate
poker game among manufacturers facing mounting currency losses but fearful
that any price rise would further depress sales and reduce market share.
This week Ford blinked. The company announced price rises averaging 4.5 to
7.5 per cent on its mainstream models and as much as 10 per cent on the
high-powered but low-volume Escort Cosworth.
The first signs are emerging that the decline in the UK new car market
during the past three years may finally be halting - registrations have been
higher than a year ago in three of the past four months. But the competition
to capitalise on any growth next year will be intense.
Ford now faces an anxious wait to see whether other hard-pressed car
producers follow its lead on prices or whether they choose instead to push
for higher sales at the expense of the UK market leader. Yesterday, it
received some encouragement from Rover's announcement that it would increase
the prices of its cars by an average of 2.9 per cent. Like Ford, the UK
carmaker is trying to reduce losses.
Despite the barrage of criticism its move triggered from consumer groups and
politicians, Ford's was not the first car price increase to follow
devaluation. It is the biggest since Black Wednesday, but the US carmaker
has not been alone in feeling the pressure to limit the damage wrought by
devaluation on its bottom line.
At the beginning of November, Mr Bill Ebbert, chairman and managing director
of Vauxhall, was preparing to make a speech in Cheshire to celebrate the
opening of General Motors' Pounds 190m engine plant at Ellesmere Port.
The draft of the speech, readied by the morning, declared that Vauxhall was
'under severe cost pressure' in the wake of the devaluation, but it had 'no
plans at the moment to increase the prices of our cars built in Germany'.
By the evening this confident paragraph had been dropped.
Over dinner, the Vauxhall chairman was already steeling himself to make the
first move on prices. The next day Vauxhall announced it was raising the
prices of all of its cars by an average of 3.25 per cent.
Deliberations have been no easier at Volkswagen. Mr Daniel Goeudevert, head
of the VW make and from next month group deputy chairman, thought he had an
agreement at the Paris motor show in early October to increase VW's prices
in the UK by 4.9 per cent.
VW's UK importer, VAG United Kingdom, was not so sanguine. The VW group may
be the undisputed market leader in western Europe, but in the UK it is only
a medium-sized player overshadowed by Ford, Vauxhall, Rover and the Peugeot
group of France which includes Citroen.
VW decided it did not have the market muscle to make the first move and
chose to sweat it out until the bigger players acted. Only two days after
the Vauxhall announcement, VW jumped to increase its own prices by 2.9 per
cent.
Pricing decisions have seldom been more difficult in a UK market that has
fallen by nearly a third during the recession - about 730,000 fewer new cars
will be sold this year than in the peak year of 1989. But of all the car
manufacturers, it is Ford that is on the rack in the UK.
Its decision this week to raise the prices of its UK-built Fiesta and
Escort/Orion ranges by 4.5 per cent and its Belgian and German-built Sierra
and Granada ranges by 7.5 per cent is a clear admission that all the
price-cutting and discounting initiatives of the past two years have simply
failed to 'move the metal'.
As recently as the British motorshow in Birmingham in October Ford still
appeared to believe that the depressed UK car market could be revived by
traditional price cutting methods. Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain
chairman and managing director, declared that the company had decided 'to
take determined action to stimulate the market' and announced price cuts of
up to Pounds 520 on some Escort/Orion models and up to Pounds 955 on some of
its Fiesta models.
Its actions appear to have aroused more confusion than confidence among
would-be car buyers, however. The motor show price cuts followed a 1.8 per
cent price rise in August. Those cuts have now been followed by this week's
rise.
Carmakers' opaque pricing policies have prompted angry reactions from
consumer groups and some opposition politicians. They claim that the
industry's price rises are an attempt to reap the benefit of the recent
abolition of special car tax. This measure, announced in the chancellor's
Autumn Statement in mid-November, reduced the price of a Pounds 10,000 car
by about Pounds 400.
According to Mr Stephen Locke, the Consumers' Association's director of
policy, Ford's latest move 'confirms all our worst fears about the
manufacturers' desire to see the UK as a high-price, high-profit market'. Mr
Nigel Griffiths, Labour spokesman on consumer affairs, claims that the
chancellor 'is being walked over by the manufacturers'.
Mr McAllister responds that it is absurd to claim that Britain is a 'high
price, high profit' market given the decline in the profitability of UK
manufacturers and the severity of the recession.
In the past, the evidence certainly suggests that consumers have been
justified in believing that they have been overcharged for cars in Britain.
But if it once was the case, recession and devaluation now appear to have
brought UK prices on to a par with continental Europe - at least for the
moment.
Ford prices in the UK (pre-tax) would be 'very much in line with those in
Belgium and below those in the major markets like Germany and France', even
after the latest price increase comes into effect in January, insists Mr
McAllister.
According to Ford, the price of a 1.6 litre Ford Escort LX (excluding tax,
adjusted for equipment levels, and not taking into account dealer discounts)
in the UK would be Ecu12,001 after the latest price increase, compared with
Ecu12,913 in Germany, Ecu12,842 in France, Ecu12,630 in Belgium and
Ecu11,015 in Italy.
After moving temporarily into the black in the first half of the year
following a record loss in 1991, Ford is again suffering mounting losses. In
recent months three and four-day weeks have been introduced on its UK
assembly lines, as production has had to be cut to reduce excess stocks. As
a result, it needs to raise prices as far as the market can bear.
Britain has traditionally been one of Ford's most reliable profit sources
around the world, but no longer. As market leader it is under attack from
all sides, but it no longer has the same financial muscle to fight off its
rivals or cope with the fundamental shifts that are taking place in the
balance of power in the UK car market.
Both General Motors (Vauxhall in the UK and Opel in continental Europe) and
PSA Peugeot Citroen of France have made big inroads in the UK, partly at
Ford's expense. Helped by the increasing strength of its product range,
Vauxhall has more than doubled its share of the UK market to 17 per cent
from 8.6 per cent in 1981, allowing it to oust Rover from second place.
The combined marques of Peugeot and Citroen are now claiming 12 per cent of
the UK market compared with 6.4 per cent a decade ago.
The Japanese have arrived in strength, with the addition of cars built in
the UK, led by Nissan, Toyota and Honda. The Japanese share, currently at
12.1 per cent for the first 11 months this year, is expected by most
automotive analysts to rise to at least 20 per cent by the end of the
decade.
At the bottom of the market new competitors have appeared, such as Proton
from Malaysia, that are selling aggressively with low prices. Proton, which
was only launched in Britain in 1989, has already won a 1 per cent share of
the UK market.
Shifts in consumer taste have also hit Ford. Sales of diesel-powered cars
have begun to rise quickly - capturing 15.9 per cent of the UK market in
November compared with 6.4 per cent in the whole of 1990. But the benefits
have fallen in particular to the Peugeot group, not to Ford.
The combination of these factors has steadily eroded Ford's share of UK new
car sales. From a level of more than 30 per cent in 1981 and 1982 it has
fallen to 22.5 per cent in the first 11 months this year. In November Ford
accounted for only 19 per cent of UK new car sales compared with 25 per cent
in the same month a year ago.
According to Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at
Cardiff Business School, the latest Ford price rises do indicate a change of
strategy. 'It may well mean that, having accepted that its once-traditional
30 per cent share is history, it has decided that even a 25 per cent share
is not worth buying and that it is better to settle for 20 per cent with
sales that are profitable.'
Mr McAllister admits that 'market share is a difficult issue - pride gets in
the way', but he insists that Ford has pulled back from the unprofitable
business of selling to the daily rental fleets, where it has foregone sales
of around 18,000 cars this year.
'Pushing money to buy market share does not get you anything. It disguises
fundamental issues you are facing,' he says.
Mr McAllister insists optimistically that new products to be launched next
year will help Ford to rebuild its UK share. Hopes are riding most
importantly on the Mondeo, which will replace the Sierra in the spring, and
the Maverick four-wheel drive leisure vehicle to be launched in the autumn.
But the Mondeo is set to meet head-on competition from the first products of
Honda's and Toyota's new UK plants as well as the Rover 600 (sister car to
Honda's new UK-built Accord) and the new Citroen Xantia, the replacement for
the old BX.
To add to the daunting challenges facing Ford, Volkswagen this week agreed
to pay Pounds 124m to take direct control of its VW/Audi importer and
distributor from Lonrho, the international trading group.
Volkswagen is clearly not willing to live any longer with its relative
weakness in the UK. 'I am not going to accept only 4 per cent of one of the
largest markets in Europe,' says Mr Goeudevert.
After three years of being locked in recession, the first signs may be
emerging that UK new car sales have started a slow recovery. But the battle
for a share of that growth can only intensify.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Leading Article: Twin deficits in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH prime minister will not find the European summit in Edinburgh
particularly enjoyable. It may not have been an annus horribilis, but it has
been a horrible six months. Yet Mr Major enjoys what might seem to be a
consolation. For the first time in at least three years, short-term
prospects for the British economy look as good as those of most other
European economies. The question for the British government is, for a
change, not whether there will be a recovery of some kind, but whether it
will last.
What will Mr Major see when he looks round the table? Mr Mitterrand's France
will be the best performing leading European economy this year and probably
in 1993 as well. Nevertheless, it must suffer the high interest rates
imposed by the Bundesbank, while the French franc is under pressure once
more. Next year will mark the 10th anniversary of the switch towards the
policy of rigeur. It will also mark another rise in French unemployment.
Meanwhile, Mr Amato's lira has been evicted from the exchange rate mechanism
quite as ignominiously as the British pound, but with less pleasurable
results. So grave is Italy's fiscal crisis that the Bank of Italy, far from
being able to exploit the apparent opportunity to lower interest rates, has
had to keep three-month rates at the usurious level of 14 1/2 per cent.
As for Mr Kohl's Germany, it is in recession. Nonetheless, the Bundesbank
remains resolute. In the light of this year's monetary overshooting, the
announcement that its target range for the growth of broad money next year
is to be 4.5 to 6.5 per cent represents a grim warning, even though it is 1
percentage point higher than this year's target. The Bundesbank has served
notice on its critics that it still wants every excuse for not cutting
interest rates.
British disease
The fact that the Bundesbank does not want lower interest rates makes an
intriguing contrast with the UK. For the first time since 1968, crowed the
Treasury yesterday, the UK's underlying rate of inflation is marginally
below that in Germany. Yet the Bundesbank regards German inflation of 3.7
per cent as a disaster, while one city economist reacted to the British news
by saying that 'the government can afford to treat recovery as the main
priority', since the inflationary flame would not be rekindled until the
middle of 1993. Short-termism remains the British disease, Bundesbankers
will naturally conclude.
Whether or not it makes sense for governments to switch their attention from
growth to inflation and back again, like a pendulum, Mr Major does have the
immediate luxury of going for growth. Underlying inflation is within the
chancellor's target of 1 to 4 per cent, while the latest wage settlements
are also below 4 per cent, according to the Confederation of British
Industry.
Consumer spending
Since private consumption accounts for just under two-thirds of aggregate
demand, the route to any really swift economic recovery runs via the
consumer's pocket. Naturally, the shopkeepers of Britain wish consumers were
the spendthrifts they so recently were. So does the chancellor. Fortunately,
consumers are likely to remain cautious. A modest expansion of consumer
demand is desirable. But there can be too much of a good thing. In the case
of the UK economy, that point might be reached rather swiftly.
Nobody knows what difference the new panel of forecasters will make to the
Treasury's performance. The group is engagingly heterodox, but this very
diversity ensures that the Treasury will be able to lay off the blame, which
may be the point of the exercise. In any case, it must cast its net more
widely. Mr Bill Martin, of stockbrokers Phillips &amp; Drew and not himself a
panellist, brings out why a consumer boom would be risky. He forecasts the
following perfectly plausible combination for 1994: unemployment at 12 1/2
per cent of the labour force; a current account deficit at 4 per cent of
gross domestic product; and a public sector borrowing requirement at 9 per
cent of GDP. The UK's 'twin-deficits' would then dwarf anything seen in the
US during the 1980s.
If the government is seen to be taking a risk with inflation, it is almost
certain to face a crisis in either the foreign exchange markets, the gilt
market or both. The result would be higher interest rates once more - both
long and short term - and probably an aborted recovery. There is no safe
alternative to export-led growth, however uncomfortably slow it would
initially be.
As the government realises its predicament, any temptation to gloat over the
pain elsewhere in Europe will disappear. Mr Major needs a buoyant European
market, since this is where almost two-thirds of British exports are sold.
The less buoyant that market, the more sterling will have to depreciate and
the greater the inflationary dangers.
Recovery is, indeed, likely. But the government will need pay and spending
restraint at home and vigorous growth abroad if this recovery is to be more
than a flash in the pan.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Inflation figure reflects falls in mortgage rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIG FALLS in mortgage interest rates placed strong downward pressure on
headline inflation last month.
The retail prices index fell to 139.7 in November, compared with 139.9 in
the previous month. That took the annual rate to 3 per cent, a significant
drop on October, when inflation was running at 3.6 per cent.
The Central Statistical Office said the reduction in mortgage interest
payments, after interest rate cuts in October, was one of the main factors
behind the drop. More recent cuts in base rates would continue to affect the
index into the new year, the CSO said.
The RPI, excluding mortgage interest payments, rose by 3.6 per cent in the
year to November compared with 3.8 per cent in October. The fall could be
explained by depressed price rises in four main components of the index:
Food prices rose by 0.4 per cent in the year to November, the lowest rate of
increase for this component of the index since May 1983. Seasonal food
prices, which usually rise in November, fell by 0.2 per cent on the month,
and by 12.4 per cent compared with a year ago. It was the sharpest fall in
prices since May 1983, when they fell by 16.1 per cent. The decline
reflected cheaper potatoes and eggs, and plentiful supplies of fresh fruit
and vegetables. Non-seasonal food fell by 0.2 per cent on the month. The
price of tobacco rose by 8.5 per cent in the 12 months to November, down
from 9.5 per cent in October. That was because prices rose by only 0.8 per
cent last month, after a 1.7 per cent rise in October.
Further discount sales, especially for women's clothing, lay behind another
year-on-year decline in the prices of clothing and footwear. Prices fell by
0.4 per cent on the month, the first fall for any November since 1981.
Compared with a year ago, prices fell by 0.6 per cent.
Lower car prices offset the effect on motoring expenditure of higher petrol
prices. Prices compared with a year ago rose by 4.2 per cent.
The CSO said the higher cost of imports, after sterling's devaluation in
September, had not yet affected retail price inflation. A lag of several
months is expected.
The figures also showed that service-sector inflation is proving harder to
quash. Prices of personal goods and services - a component that includes
chemists' goods, hairdressing, dental charges and subscriptions to private
healthcare - rose by 5.5 per cent in the year to November, an increase on
the previous month, when it rose by 5.3 per cent.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Building society's debt rating cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE became the first building society to have its short-term debt
rating lowered when Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, downgraded the
rating on Nationwide's commercial paper and certificates of deposit from A1
to A2 yesterday.
S&amp;P said the downgrade reflected the 'impact of the continued weakness of
the UK housing market on Nationwide's asset quality', adding that the high
level of mortgage arrears would require heavy provisioning charges in the
current and future financial years.
Borrowers normally find that their funding costs rise when the rating on
their short-term or long-term debt is lowered.
Mr Richard Lassen, treasurer at Nationwide, said the society would 'probably
stay away from the commercial paper market for the next few months' to avoid
higher costs. 'We can continue funding in the UK, principally by winding
down our very high level of liquidity.'
Nationwide, the second-largest building society, has a Dollars 2bn (Pounds
1.28bn) commercial paper programme that has been fully used, and the paper
is due to mature over the next few months. It will continue to issue
certificates of deposit. Nationwide has total debts of about Pounds 7bn.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Limit sought on auditor damages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should consider limiting the extent of damages that can be
awarded against auditors and widening the groups to whom they are
responsible, Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council,
said yesterday.
He called for an examination of ways to reduce the escalating legal awards
against auditors and for a review of the restrictive 'duty of care' of
auditors determined in the House of Lords Caparo judgment.
His comments built on his statement in the council's second annual review,
being sent to all listed companies, and echo the conclusions of the Cadbury
committee on the financial aspects of corporate governance, of which he was
a member.
Sir Ron said he had written to the Department of Trade and Industry
expressing his concerns on the subject.
In the council's review, he called for companies and auditors to approach
the Accounting Standards Board's urgent issues task force to gain approval
for new accounting practices before they are adopted.
He wants to see the task force move in the direction of its equivalent in
the US, rather than reacting to dubious new accounting practices once they
have emerged in published company accounts.
Mr David Tweedie, chairman of the ASB, emphasised in the review that it was
important to give companies and accountants time to discuss, comment on and
adapt to new accounting standards in an evolutionary way.
As a result, he said the board would issue only two new standards next year.
He also said there was no intention to amend existing standards until at
least two years after they were introduced.
But the ASB is also expected to produce final guidance on the operating and
financial review.
Sir Ron said the Financial Reporting Review Panel was concerned about a
number of issues that do not conflict with company law but which 'do not
best serve the interests of informing shareholders and creditors on the
financial affairs of companies'.

extensively with auditors in an effort to improve the effectiveness of
regulation and cut its cost.
In a letter yesterday, Mr John Young, chief executive, said the association

It is proposed that the association should brief auditors on issues

FT  12 DEC 92 / Travel trade ponders lull before storm: The sector's hopes
prior to its busy season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE LOOKING for a quiet spot in London away from the Christmas crowds
should try Thomas Cook in Fleet Street.
Outside, the grey pavements are crowded with harassed City folk. Inside the
travel agency, the staff are friendly and unhurried. At the height of the
lunch hour there are three members of the public present: one browsing
through brochures, one booking a flight to London for relatives from
Belfast, and one talking to counter staff about a holiday.
'Touch wood, it's the lull before the storm,' says Mr Adrian Sneyd, the
travel agency chain's regional manager for the City. 'People are now doing
their Christmas shopping or whatever. Shortly after Christmas we'll be in
peak-season booking mode.'
Mr Sneyd insists one should not read too much into the sight of a near-empty
agency. Travel companies believe they have proved they can weather the
recession better than most industries.
Thomas Cook, the UK's second-biggest travel agency chain, says winter
bookings are down on last year, particularly to warm destinations, but a
strong ski market has limited the drop to 5 per cent.
The company's biggest suppliers are also reasonably optimistic. Thomson, the
UK's biggest tour operator, says it has sold almost all its Christmas
holidays.
Airtours, the third-biggest, which last Monday announced profits up 33 per
cent, says its winter 1992-93 bookings are ahead of last year.
The week before last, Thomas Cook in Fleet Street saw bookings rise by 38
per cent, Mr Sneyd says. He concedes that percentages can be misleading. In
the equivalent week last year, the branch booked only 100 holidays.
Mr Tim Boyce, a solicitor at Freshfields, the City law firm, has come in to
pick up some skiing brochures. Travel industry managers say they have
noticed skiers opting for cheaper January dates rather than the peak season
of February.
Mr Boyce is not sure he will go at all. 'It depends on the price. I'm not
sure I can afford it.'
Miss Jennifer Lobell, an accountant with Peat Marwick, has come to buy some
travellers cheques. She is off this weekend to the Swiss resort of Verbier
on a skiing holiday she has organised privately rather than through Thomas
Cook.
Last year she went skiing for two weeks. This year she is going for only
three days.
Some say they are not cutting back on their holidays. Mr Edgar Hill, an
accountant, says: 'Touch wood, the recession has passed me by.'
Heading out of the door with some brochures, he says: 'We went in April last
year to Portugal. We're thinking of making a tradition of it.'
By 2pm, with the lunch hour over, the one customer who was discussing his
holiday half an hour previously has finally made up his mind. Mr Richard
Williams, an accountant with Unilever, hands over his credit card and takes
possession of his tickets.
He is going skiing at the end of this month, but he has booked directly with
the resort. All he has bought from Thomas Cook is his ferry crossing to
France at a cost of Pounds 150.
When Christmas is over the travel companies will start pushing their summer
offerings.
Mr Sneyd says: 'If you come back in the second week of January, hopefully
they'll be stacked to the door.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / Women's retirement age of 65 backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL SECURITY ministers are backing an increase in the state retirement
age for women from 60 to 65, with the savings being used to help cushion the
impact for some groups, as their preferred way of equalising pension ages.
After a 12-month consultation ends this month, Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, is expected to announce next year his proposals for
conforming male and female retirement ages.
The Treasury has put strong pressure on Mr Lilley to increase the female
retirement age. Before consultations began, the Treasury wanted a retirement
age of 67 included as an option, it emerged this week. The state retirement
age for men is already 65. A decision will be taken after further
discussions with the Treasury and in cabinet. Lowering the male retirement
age to 60 has been all but ruled out and a compromise of 63 is receding as a
possibility. A flexible decade of retirement has been rejected as
unworkable.
Making many women work for five years longer will be politically unpopular
but the impact will be softened by phasing in the changes over at least 10
years, possibly longer.
Mr Lilley hopes that the estimated Pounds 3bn annual savings would not all
return to the Treasury but be used to help particular groups.
In August the Social Security Advisory Committee, which advises the
government on pensions policy, said savings from the increase to 65 could be
used to help pensioners whose working lives were badly paid and interrupted.
Most would be women.
Other options would be to allow earlier retirement on lower pensions or to
offer better pensions for those who are dependent only on the state.
No consensus emerged from the 4,000 responses received from companies,
pension experts and representative organisations during the government's
consultation. Social security ministers believe the increase can be
justified also because people are living longer and increasingly likely to
have an occupational or personal pension. They wish to focus resources more
closely on those most in need.
The move to equalise retirement ages follows a European Court ruling
outlawing different pension benefits.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Record Pounds 4.4m for Dutch master: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PAINTING by Pieter de Hooch, 'The Courtyard of a House of Delft', sold for
Pounds 4.4m at Christie's in London yesterday to the dealer Noortman. The
1658 painting, from the golden age of Dutch art, is similar to a work in the
National Gallery.
For more than 150 years it has hung at Wrotham Park, Hertfordshire. Before
that, it was in the collection of the Empress Josephine.
The price was slightly below its estimate of between Pounds 4.5m and Pounds
6.5m (possibly because a child in the picture has a distorted face) but was
a record for a work by de Hooch. It ensured a successful auction of Old
Master paintings, which totalled Pounds 12.3m. There were 10 artist records
and the morning session was 24 per cent unsold.
After the sale, a portrait of Madame de Vicq, by Rubens, which had
disappeared from view for almost 150 years, was sold for Pounds 990,000,
just below its estimate of between Pounds 1m and Pounds 1.5m. If it had been
bought during the auction the result would have looked even better.
Another work by Rubens, a painting of 'The Entombment' that was only
recently re-discovered, sold above its estimate for Pounds 1.045m, while an
oil sketch by the same artist for a tapestry went for Pounds 748,000, which
was a record for a Rubens in this medium. A Venetian view of the Molo by
Canaletto was on target at Pounds 462,000, and 'Fruit in a Basket' by the
Dutch painter Ambrosius Bosschaert II doubled its estimate at Pounds
319,000.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER is to raise its car prices by an average of 2.9 per cent across the
range from December 21, Kevin Done writes.
The move follows Ford's announcement earlier this week of price increases
from January 4 for UK-built Fiesta and Escort/Orion cars by an average of
4.5 per cent and for Sierra and Granada cars by an average of 7.5 per cent.
Ford and other carmakers have blamed increased prices largely on the recent
devaluation of sterling. But Rover, a subsidiary of British Aerospace, said
it had not been affected as badly by the devaluation because 80 per cent of
its parts came from the UK.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Oil is shown as least 'green' fuel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ENVIRONMENTAL costs of using oil are higher than those of any other type
of energy, according to estimates from the Department of Trade and Industry.
The provisional figures rank the damaging effects of oil above those of
'old' coal - used in conventional power stations without emission controls -
and considerably ahead of those of 'new' coal. The present fierce debate
over the UK's future energy sources has found it difficult to quantify the
environmental and social costs of the options.
The 300-page report, commissioned by the former Energy Department from the
Centre for Social and Economic Research on the Global Environment, draws on
existing work to put money values on the non-market costs of a fuel. It uses
a value of Pounds 2m per human life, based on people's willingness to pay to
reduce risk.
Corrosion and damage to buildings accounts for more than half of oil's
estimated cost of 5.56p per kilowatt-hour of energy (/kWh). Damage to crops
from pollution accounts for just under a fifth of the cost.
Old coal is costed at 5p/kWh and new coal at 1.18p/kWh. The study emphasises
that pollution levels of power stations vary widely.
Modern nuclear pressurised-water reactors have an environmental cost of
between 0.32p/kWh and 0.37p/kWh. That does not include figures for effects
on plants and animals.
Combined heat and power systems - mini power stations for industrial estates
and housing blocks - have an estimated total cost of 0.45p/kWh. Solar, wind
and hydroelectric have the lowest costs, at between 0.04p/kWh and 0.07p/kWh,
but those figures omit the visual impact or the disruption of building dams.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Housing cut plan angers associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING associations reacted with fury last night to a leaked paper that
proposes a steep reduction in the number of associations receiving
government grants to build homes for rent.
The paper, leaked to Housing Associations Weekly, was drawn up by the
Housing Corporation, the quango that distributes the grants. It recommends
cutting the number of associations receiving grants from more than 560 to
87, with another 46 included if their finances improved sufficiently.
The Housing Corporation acknowledged yesterday that it was examining a range
of policy options to ensure 'the efficient and effective delivery of social
housing'. Even so, Mr Anthony Mayer, chief executive of the corporation,
said that did not 'imply that a particular policy has been determined or
adopted'.
The Housing Corporation paper was drawn up after the chancellor announced
cuts in funding for housing associations in the Autumn Statement last month.
The grant paid to associations for building inexpensive housing will fall
from 75 per cent of costs this year to 67 per cent next year and to 55 per
cent by 1995.
That will force housing associations to borrow more of the cost of new homes
on the capital markets. The number of lenders in the market is described by
the paper as 'disappointingly low', with enthusiasm in the City for housing
association bond issues having 'quickly evaporated'.
The Housing Corporation paper says that government grants should be
restricted to high-performing associations that can borrow on the 'finest
terms'. It also says that such a move would protect public funds invested in
associations, which will face increasing financial pressure after the
reduction in grant.
Financial ratios developed in consultation with Hambros Bank put 87
associations in division one, fully eligible for funding. Another 46 fall
into division two, needing to improve to continue receiving grant.
Mr Jim Coulter, director of the National Federation of Housing Associations,
immediately called for the paper to be withdrawn.
Ms Sheila Button, who chairs the Metropolitan Housing Trust, said the
government appeared to be second-guessing the capital markets. 'The market
is developing and we haven't had any trouble raising money,' she said.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Theatres in England to receive government subsidies from
regional arts boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVOLUTION on the boards: the leading regional theatres in England,
including Manchester's Royal Exchange (above), will receive government
subsidies from regional arts boards instead of from the Arts Council, Mr
Peter Brooke, the heritage minister, said yesterday, Antony Thorncroft
writes.
The reform devolves 42 arts clients, sharing a subsidy of Pounds 14m, from
the control of the Arts Council in London. The council will still deal
directly with 144 companies, including the national companies such as the
Royal Opera House and the Royal National Theatre. The council's budget this
year is Pounds 225m.
Other theatre companies devolved include the Bristol Old Vic, the West
Yorkshire Playhouse, the Leicester Haymarket, the Nottingham Playhouse, and
in London the Bush, the Young Vic and the Hampstead Theatre. The London Arts
Board will also fund the Wigmore Hall and the Photographer's Gallery.
The devolution is less drastic than that envisaged by Mr Richard Luce, a
previous arts minister, who planned to confine the Arts Council to a mainly
advisory role.
The leading orchestras, including the LSO, the LPO, the RPO, and the
Philharmonia, along with the CBSO in Birmingham and the Halle in Manchester,
have won their fight to remain centrally funded, as have the Royal Court
Theatre in London, Opera North, the Institute of Contemporary Arts, and the
Serpentine and Whitechapel galleries in London and Ikon in Birmingham.
Mr Brooke said the quality of the orchestras is judged nationally while
theatres have regional competitors, enabling local arts boards to evaluate
their performance.
The changes in funding take place in April 1994. In the meantime, the role
of the Arts Council will be examined. It is likely to become more of a
strategic organisation, although it will still supervise the workings of the
regional arts boards. It could also distribute money to the arts from the
national lottery.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Fears over loss of funds for union ballots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHOEBE KING and CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABILITY of unions to use strike ballots as a bargaining tactic will be
undermined by the withdrawal of public funds for ballots, according to
industrial relations experts.
Some unions have exploited the law requiring strike ballots by winning large
majorities for industrial action, putting pressure on employers even when
few workers intend to strike.
Mr Bob Simpson, senior labour law lecturer at the London School of
Economics, said the withdrawal of funding plus the requirement for postal
rather than workplace strike ballots, included in the Employment Bill, would
reduce union bargaining power. 'Unions could eventually find themselves
unable to make viable threats of industrial action because employers will
know they cannot afford to ballot,' he said.
The phased withdrawal of ballot money came as a surprise to unions and
employers. One employers' representative warned that it might increase the
incidence of unofficial action.
Most union ballots have been workplace ballots which have not been eligible
for state support. Workplace ballots, however, cost only about 60 per cent
of postal ballots. The Electoral Reform Society calculates that postal
ballots cost about 50p a head, including postage and printing costs.
The trade union certification officer said the TGWU general union - the
largest union - claimed Pounds 900,298 for postal ballots last year, nearly
a quarter of the Pounds 4m total. The union said the claim was high because
of the cost of running elections for its general and deputy general
secretaries. In 1990, the union claimed only Pounds 15,994.
Last year the AEEU electrical and engineering union claimed Pounds 461,374,
the GMB general union Pounds 302,915 and the Bifu banking union Pounds
107,732.
Mr Simpson also said that the withdrawal of Pounds 2m of public money from
union training would not be felt for 'some time' but if union officials were
not trained they would lack negotiating skills.
More than  1/2 m union officials have taken government-funded courses since
they were set up in 1976.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Poor rail service leads to BR discounts on 11 lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMUTERS on 11 British Rail lines will qualify for the first season ticket
discounts to be offered under the Passenger's Charter in the new year, it
was announced yesterday.
By far the worst performer is InterCity, which has five of its seven routes
doing badly enough to trigger 5 per cent discounts for season ticket
renewals.
Network SouthEast, by contrast, is ending the year with only the Kent Coast
line offering discounts, and Regional Railways is meeting targets on all but
five of its 23 routes.
One reason for Network SouthEast's success is that different targets were
set for each of its 15 lines, according to the investment they had received,
while InterCity has one performance target for all routes.
InterCity says it is unrealistic for all its routes to perform to one
standard because, like Network SouthEast's, some badly need investment and
others are newly modernised. Its plea for differing targets is believed to
have been rejected because that would have meant softening the target for
most lines, and the government is not prepared to relax the charter.
Three of InterCity's routes - Anglia, West Coast and Cross Country - are
failing on punctuality and another two - Midland Main Line and Gatwick
Express - on reliability.
The performance of Network SouthEast's routes will prompt criticism that its
targets are too soft. Next year's targets are likely to be much tougher.
The services triggering discounts are Cross Country, East Midlands and
Lincs, West Midlands, Cardiff Valleys, and North East.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Row over dockyard contract intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHIEFS of two naval dockyards joined battle yesterday over the tactics
used to win a government contract that would secure thousands of jobs.
The privately managed yards at Devonport, Plymouth, and Rosyth, Fife, are
competing for a Ministry of Defence contract to refit nuclear submarines.
Devonport argued that the 'goalposts had been moved' when Rosyth submitted a
late proposal for the contract on Thursday, after the government extended
the final deadline. It further accused Rosyth of adopting a plan similar to
its own and which Rosyth had previously said was inadequate.
Mr Mike Leece, chief executive of Devonport Management Limited, said: 'What
really galls is that it has taken us 28 months to develop our proposals.
It's physically not possible for any company to do the same unless they have
had access to our information.'
Mr Allan Smith, managing director of Babcock Thorn, which manages Rosyth
Royal Dockyards, denied that he had access to Devonport's proposals. He said
Babcock had 'dusted off' old plans for the MoD. The two yards had initially
submitted very different proposals: Rosyth that new docks should be built,
and Devonport that the old ones could be upgraded.
Mr Smith said the MoD had recently indicated that it wanted to see a
proposal for upgraded docks from both dockyards. He said: 'We still believe
new-build is better, but if they (the MoD) are prepared to live with an
upgrade, then it can be done at Rosyth as well as it can at Devonport.' The
upgrade would be much cheaper than building from scratch.
The MoD announced last week that the decision between the two yards would
not now be taken until the new year.
The post-cold-war fleet was smaller, the MoD said, and there was not enough
nuclear submarine refitting work for both yards. It said the extra time was
needed to gather information from the companies, other ministries and about
the local economies around the yards.
Mr Smith acknowledged that wider issues had become involved in the
contracts. 'It's a question of whether our communities gain. We are fighting
on their behalf.'

FT  12 DEC 92 / Boeing works on new engine mounts for 737
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING is working on an improved design for the engine mounts of its older
737 twin-engine airliners, after a Delta Air Lines 737 lost an engine after
take-off at Dallas-Fort Worth earlier this year.
The US manufacturer yesterday confirmed it was preparing a service bulletin
to airline customers on a newly designed engine aft-mount secondary support
system for its 737-200 and 737-100 airliners.
Boeing has been working in close consultation with Delta, the US National
Transportation Safety Board and the US Federal Aviation Administration on
the new design for the engine mounts on the 1,040 Boeing 737-200s and 27
Boeing 737-100s still in service.
British Airways is a large Boeing 737-200 operator, with 43 aircraft in its
fleet, the UK carrier said yesterday.
Although the engine mountings are different on the Boeing 737, these parts
have also been identified by investigators as the probable cause of the
crash of an El Al Boeing 747 cargo jumbo jet last October in Amsterdam and a
similar incident involving a Boeing 747 cargo jet in Taiwan a year ago.
Boeing is now redesigning for the second time the fuse pins used in Boeing
747 mounts and recently completed a programme to improve engine mountings on
the Boeing 757 twin-engine airliner.
The US manufacturer said yesterday it was not yet in a position to discuss
any eventual retrofit of 737 engine mounts, their schedule and cost.
Boeing said there had only been three occasions, including the Delta
incident this year, of when an engine separated from a 737 in flight, in
over 50m flight hours in 25 years of service.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Wave of Indian violence recedes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE wave of violence which has swept India since the destruction of the
Ayodhya mosque was yesterday showing signs of receding as tough action by
the police and army restored order in many districts.
Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, said the situation was dangerous
for the country but 'the worst part is behind us as of today.' He told
foreign journalists India had survived bouts of inter-religious violence in
the past and would survive this one. 'We have been able to live together. We
have been able to obliterate whatever tears of bitterness there have been.
This we can do again.'
Mr Rao admitted the crisis would prove a 'setback' for the economy, but a
temporary one, while businessmen waited for the unrest to die down. However,
once people saw that normalcy had returned they would have no doubts left
about the country or about the government's continuing commitment to
economic reform, he said.
Over 1,000 people have died since Hindu militants stormed the Ayodhya mosque
during a rally organised last Sunday by the militant Hindu Bharatiya Janata
party, the main opposition party. Most of the dead have been Moslems shot by
police during violent street protests and revenge attacks on temples.
Hindus have hit back with raids on Moslems.
The death toll yesterday rose from 960 to about 1,020, including those who
died in hospital from earlier injuries.
The BJP yesterday remained in defiant mood, though it cancelled planned
demonstrations outside the Pakistani and Bangladeshi high commissions. It
condemned the government's ban on militant organisations, including the
Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the core of the Hindu militant movement from
which the BJP was born.
Bombay, which bore the brunt of the earlier violence, was mostly quiet
yesterday, though the atmosphere remained tense, with curfews in force in
many districts. In Calcutta, which has a long history of Hindu-Moslem
violence, firm action by the security forces seems to have prevented serious
incidents. Only about 20 people have died in West Bengal, which includes
Calcutta, compared with 200 in Bombay.
A huge police presence has suppressed violence in Delhi, though tempers are
running high, as was shown yesterday in street fights between Moslems and
police in the north east of the city in which three died.
The worst-affected states now seem to be Gujarat in the west and Uttar
Pradesh in the north, which both have large Moslem populations. Tensions are
particularly high in Uttar Pradesh because it includes Ayodhya and two other
mosques which Hindu militants claim stand on temple sites.
Troops were given shoot-on-sight orders to stop rioters in Kanpur, an
industrial city of 6m people on the banks of the Ganges river in Uttar
Pradesh. Six thousand soldiers were reported to be in the city.

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment in China will be affected if the current Sino-British
dispute about the political development of Hong Kong drags on for months, Mr
Willie Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, one of the largest business groups
in Hong Kong, said yesterday.
He said the decision by Standard &amp; Poors, a US credit rating agency, to put
Hong Kong on its 'watch' list last Monday was not itself serious. However if
S&amp;P decided to downgrade Hong Kong in the New Year then investors in the US
and Europe would note it. Hong Kong's senior foreign currency is rated A and
its local currency is rated A+.
'If (the row) drags on it will reduce the trend of strong investment flows
into China,' Mr Purves said in an interview. 'Businessmen do not like
uncertainty.'
Mr Purves, who is also a member of Governor Chris Patten's Executive
Council, would not give his personal view on the political row.
However, Mr Li Ka-shing, a former director of the bank and one of Hong
Kong's richest men, has come out against the governor's proposals. Mr Li,
one of the colony's most astute entrepreneurs, has been drawing closer to
Beijing over the past year as China's embrace of the market economy has
gathered pace.
Mr Li was yesterday reported in Wen Wei Pao, a pro-Beijing daily, as saying
the Hong Kong people wanted prosperity, stability and a smooth transition of
sovereignty in 1997. He said the Basic Law - the colony's post-1997
mini-constitution - was a good document.
Mr Purves said he had not detected any significant change in the business
climate in Hong Kong that could be related to the current political row.
There had been a slowdown in applications for residential mortgages, 'but I
think it is unrelated - and was happening anyway - to the political
dispute.'
He did, however, foresee difficulties for Hong Kong if the row continued.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Business confidence at 16-year low, report shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese economy is facing its most critical period for almost two
decades, according to a Bank of Japan report published yesterday which shows
business confidence at a 16-year low, Charles Leadbeater writes.
The survey, which will fuel speculation that interest rates will soon be
cut, shows the downturn is spreading into non-manufacturing sectors such as
retailing.
Manufacturers expect profits this year to be 25 per cent down on last year
and investment to fall by close to 14 per cent, while the labour oversupply
is growing.
The Bank of Japan's survey of 6,874 businesses, including 680 big companies,
found that confidence among manufacturers had fallen to minus 44, its lowest
level since 1976, and down from minus 27 three months earlier. Among
non-manufacturing companies it had worsened to minus 27 from minus 13 in
August. The index measures the balance of companies reporting economic
conditions as favourable minus those reporting unfavourable conditions.
Companies believe there is little prospect of an early recovery.
Small companies are being particularly hard hit.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Miyazawa reshuffles his cabinet to revive confidence: Most
senior positions in Japanese government go to faction officials, including
several implicated in scandals
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister, yesterday reshuffled his cabinet
ministers in an attempt to restore public confidence in his scandal-tainted
administration, which must deal with a series of difficult economic and
trade issues in coming months.
The reshuffle was heralded by Mr Miyazawa, who has a public approval rating
of only 14 per cent, as a sign that 'factionalism has ended' in the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party, though portfolios were distributed in line with
the present strength of the party's five main factions.
LDP officials hoped to focus public attention on the first ever appointment
of a woman cabinet minister - Ms Mayumi Moriyama at education - and the rise
of the youngest ever cabinet minister. At 39, Mr Hajime Funada, who becomes
head of the Economic Planning Agency, is 50 days younger than the previous
record-holder, Mr Kakuei Tanaka, later prime minister.
But most senior positions were given to faction officials who have waited
patiently for a turn at the top, including several who have been implicated
in political scandals since the mid-1970s. Two of the new ministers are
implicated in the still-running Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal.
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, 65, is the new finance minister, and will be confronted
by awkward decisions on public assistance to the troubled banking system and
on the amount of funds available for a further stimulation of the economy.
Mr Hayashi, fluent in English, is a former diplomat, and served for a time
in Brussels.
While Mr Hayashi is said to be an expert on taxation matters, and played an
important role in passing legislation letting Japan send military personnel
abroad on peacekeeping missions, his most important quality is that he is Mr
Miyazawa's right-hand man.
The resignation of Mr Shin Kanemaru, the godfather of the LDP, has left the
party without a policy 'fixer', and Mr Miyazawa hopes the appointment of a
close aide to the Finance Ministry will increase his own influence over
economic policy.
During his first year in office, Mr Miyazawa has appeared to be captive to
the wishes of more powerful faction heads, but wrangling within the powerful
Takeshita faction has provided an opportunity for him to appear more
assertive. The faction's split was formalised yesterday when Mr Tsutomu
Hata, the outgoing finance minister, announced the formation of a new
faction.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, 55, was appointed minister of international trade and
industry, and will be partly responsible for reaching agreement in the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.
'I believe in free trade, and I believe that Japan has to do what it can to
encourage free trade,' Mr Mori said.
However, he will not have the final word on the controversial issue of rice
imports, which remain the responsibility of Mr Masami Tanabu, 58, who
retained his post as agriculture minister.
Mr Tanabu returned yesterday from meetings in Washington and Brussels, where
he attempted to justify Japan's ban on rice imports. It is understood that
other LDP officials were reluctant to take the agriculture post, as none
wants to be remembered as the minister who opened the door to foreign rice.
Apart from rice, a test of strength for Mr Miyazawa's new cabinet will come
in its response to political reform proposals from a senior LDP committee,
which recommended that single-seat constituencies replace the scandal-prone
multi-seat system. However, a single-seat system would also undermine the
influence of faction heads such as Mr Miyazawa.

CANADA is to withdraw its peacekeeping force from Cyprus after 28 years
because of commitments elsewhere and the lack of progress in Greek-Turkish
negotiations, Reuter reports from Ottawa.
Ms Mary Collins, junior defence minister, told parliament the Canadian
contingent of 575 troops stationed in the critical Nicosia sector would
start leaving next June.
The withdrawal would be completed by September. British, Danish and Austrian
troops would continue the United Nations mission.
'After 28 years of service in Cyprus, after 28 years of watching both sides
in the dispute being either unable or unwilling to negotiate a political
solution, after 28 years of significant expenditures to maintain troops
without any measurable progress, it was time to face facts,' she said.
Canada told the United Nations in September that its patience and resources
were running short.
'Instead of taking advantage of the peace and order, some political leaders
have used the presence of UN forces to avoid making difficult choices and
compromises required to ensure peaceful co-existence,' she said.

CONSUMER prices in the US rose a slim 0.2 per cent in November as steady

Reuter reports from Washington.
The Labour Department said yesterday the rise in the consumer price index
followed an unexpectedly high 0.4 per cent gain in October.
Meanwhile retail sales rose modestly last month as the holiday sales season
opened, the Commerce Department said. A 0.4 per cent gain in November
followed a sharply revised 1.9 per cent jump in October sales - the
strongest monthly increase since a 2.3 per cent rise in January. Previously,
the department said October sales were up 0.9 per cent.
Economists had expected that sales would rise only 0.1 per cent last month.
Retail chains indicate sales since Thanksgiving have been stronger than in
the past few years.

NORTH Korea yesterday appointed Mr Kang Song-san, one of the country's chief
economic reformers, as its premier.
Mr Kang, who also served as premier in the mid-1980s, has since governed
North Hamgyong province, where he established special economic zones for
foreign investment.
He also developed local economic ties with neighbouring Russia, and is a
proponent of the UN-sponsored project to develop industrial and port
facilities in the Tumen River delta in North Hamgyong.
The return of the 61-year-old Mr Kang - believed to be a cousin of President
Kim Il-sung - to Pyongyang is likely to lead to reforms for the troubled
North Korean economy and new measures to attract investment from abroad.
Mr Yon Hyong-muk, the current premier, was probably dismissed because of the
country's growing economic problems, according to South Korean analysts.
Mr Kang introduced North Korea's first foreign joint venture law.

THE LIQUIDATORS of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International have filed
a Dollars 10.5bn civil lawsuit against Sheik Khalid bin Mahfouz, former head
of National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia, who was indicted in the US last
July on BCCI-related fraud charges.
The suit, against both Sheikh Khalid and the bank itself, is is unusual both
in its size and because it means an embarrassing legal action is being
brought against a leading banker close to the Saudi royal family.
Under US racketeering laws, the actual damages to be awarded if the lawsuit
succeeds could be trebled to more than Dollars 30bn. Sheikh Khalid has
denied all charges.
The liquidators allege in the suit - filed in the US, UK, Jersey, Luxembourg
and Switzerland - that Sheikh Khalid broke US laws by engaging in
racketeering and fraud. The suit seeks to freeze the assets of Sheikh Khalid
and the Saudi bank in each country.
The US Federal Reserve last summer levied a Dollars 170m penalty against
Sheikh Khalid. It also ordered the National Commercial Bank of Saudi Arabia
to shut down its New York branch.
In Washington, Judge Joyce Green of the district court has issued a
temporary order that stops Sheikh Khalid from transferring any of his US
assets out of the country.
In London, Mr Dennis Norman, acting general manager of National Commercial
Bank's UK operations, confirmed the bank had received a restraining order on
Sheikh Khalid's UK assets. 'We are very shocked about the action,' he said.

THAILAND will comply with United Nations sanctions against the Khmer Rouge
but needs to minimise the losses of Thai traders who do business with the
radical guerrilla group, according to Mr Prasong Soonsiri, foreign minister,
Reuter reports from Bangkok.
He said he doubted whether UN sanctions would be able to force the Khmer

CHINA yesterday welcomed a German parliamentary vote to remove trade
sanctions imposed after Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy protesters,
Reuter reports from Beijing.
The Chinese foreign ministry was quoted by the Xinhua news agency as saying:
'The complete lifting of its restrictions on co-operation with China by the
German Federal Assembly is conducive to the further improvement and
development of Sino-German ties.'
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's three-party coalition majority in the lower house
passed a motion formally to end the sanctions, which have recently been
relaxed.

URUGUAYANS vote tomorrow in a privatisation referendum, with recent opinion
polls suggesting the electorate will reject government plans to sell off
state industries, Our Foreign Staff write.
The referendum is over five central clauses of a privatisation law approved
by Congress in March. One allows the government to sell off up to 51 per
cent in the ANTEL telephone company to local and foreign investors. Others
would allow the government to determine which state assets should be
privatised and to offer public works contracts by concession.

<TEXT>
A WORLD declaration expressing determination to eliminate hunger and reduce
all forms of malnutrition was adopted in Rome yesterday by 1,400 delegates
from 160 countries at the close of the first International Conference on
Nutrition, writes Robert Graham in Rome.
The ministerial conference, organised by United Nation's Food and
Agriculture Organisation and the World Health Organisation, made no direct
reference to the situation in Somalia. But the declaration condemned wars
and civil strife as being major causes of both hunger and malnutrition, and
pleaded for safe passage of humanitarian aid.
In his opening remarks, Pope John Paul II had condoned the use of military
force to back up humanitarian aid in Somalia.
The conference concluded that although the relative proportion of people
suffering from inadequate food supplies had declined over the past 20 years,
it was still unacceptable that 780m in developing countries, equivalent to
20 per cent of their population, lived under such conditions. The problem
was no longer insufficient foods supplies but distribution and poverty.

FT  12 DEC 92 / 'City of death' becomes linchpin for aid: Somalia's lost

<TEXT>
LYING ON an operating table in a makeshift hospital in Baidoa, a
one-year-old girl called Hadeja, screamed as an American doctor cleaned out
an eye wound inflicted from a bomb-blast in the rubble-strewn town's central
market.
Hadeja, who will be blind in her right eye, is one of the hundreds of
thousands of the most tragic victims of Somalia's vicious internecine clan
fighting - the lost generation of children under five.
She was among 20 child victims of an eruption of blood-feuding which has
gripped the tense central Somali town in the past few days.
Baidoa, a ramshackle town north-west of the capital Mogadishu, is crammed
with feeding centres and clinics in the heart of the most severely affected
area of war-induced starvation. It is the US Marines' next objective in the
biggest military and humanitarian intervention ever undertaken in Africa. It
will become a linchpin of efforts to get food to an estimated
500,000-900,000 people cut off from a regular flow of food and medicine by
fighting, looting and extortion.
Up to 70 people, mainly bystanders, have been killed in an orgy of looting
and violence ahead of the arrival of US Marines into the so-called 'City of
Death'. Many 'technicals' - armed all-terrain vehicles - pulled back from
Mogadishu by Gen Mohamed Farrar Aideed, Somalia's fiercest warlord, in the
face of the US deployment have arrived in Baidoa for a final spree of
pillage before foreign troops seek to restore order after two years of
gun-law.
Terrorised aid workers in the town, who have been targets of looters and
bandits, have fortified their compounds and pleaded for the US troops to go
to Baidoa urgently to restore law and order.
Pairs of US Air Force F-14 'Tomcat' fighter jets flew over the town
yesterday on reconnaissance missions, also aimed at letting bandits and
gunmen know that US forces were on their way.
'We are disappointed that the Marines are not here yet,' said Dr Michelin
Richer, a pediatric medic with the US-based Charity International Medical
Corps, which runs Baidoa's hospital. 'It has been extremely difficult for us
to work here because of the deteriorating security. As soon as they arrive
we can stop working on emergency gunshot and bomb blast wounds and other
trauma cases and start working on the real business of kids with medical
diseases and malnutrition.'
On a tour of the pediatric ward Dr Richer pointed to several other child
casualties of the recent fighting including a girl who stepped on a mine and
had to have her leg amputated, a six-year-old boy with a gunshot wound in
his right lung and two brothers injured while playing with a grenade.
In a corner of the ward a four-year-old child lay helpless and silent,
slipping hoplessly into death. Yesterday she weighed a mere 12 pounds, about
a third of the average weight for a child of her age.
Pentagon sources said it might take Marines up to 10 days to reach Baidoa -
a period aid workers in the city, where the death rate has stabilised at
20-30 a day, say is far too long. The town and its surrounding areas need
200-300 tonnes of food a day but at the moment, because of security, relief
officials can only fly in 20-30 tonnes.
Aid workers with the international agency CARE have evacuated their women
employees but refused to quit the town because of the risks of all their
stores being looted. Instead they have piled sandbags and oil drums filled
with water around their house and placed gunmen on the rooftop to deter
bandits who have attacked their compound three times in the past six days
and made off with Dollars 20,000.
'Each day the US Marines stay in Mogadishu and do not come to Baidoa they
look weak and the gunmen get their confidence back and we become targets,'
Mr James Fennell, an official with CARE, said in Baidoa yesterday.
CARE has not brought any food to Baidoa from Mogadishu by road since an
attack on one of its convoys last month on the outskirts of the town when a
large number of vehicles were hijacked. But it will resume convoys as soon
as the intervention force is in place.
If the Pentagon is right about the 10-day delay in reaching Baidoa, many aid
workers in the difficult interior of the country will feel disappointed.
Already many believe the US operation is 'too much too late'. A recent
report by the Atlanta-based Centre for Disease Control estimated that 70 per
cent of children under five in the Baidoa area had already perished.
Researchers even found too few children to interview for their survey.
In the meantime Baidoa's long-suffering civilians and the aid workers, wait
anxiously for the first signs of US troops they hope will prove their
saviours.

<TEXT>
MR Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, said yesterday he believed the
alliance would agree to provide the necessary military means if the United
Nations decided to intervene with force in the Bosnian conflict.
After a meeting of Nato defence ministers, he stressed that the UN should
continue to take the lead and that Nato would support, but not replace it.
A Nato role in intervention would require consensus among all 16 allies, he
said, adding: 'My personal opinion is, if the UN did appeal to Nato, that we
would not say No. I cannot envisage such an answer.'
Nato military authorities were considering options for action in the former
Yugoslavia but did not have concrete plans, Mr Worner said.
He warned that limited military action such as the use of force against Serb
helicopters and aircraft defying the ban on military flights would pose a
'dilemma' for UN forces already in Bosnia.
'You would have to consider how to protect your troops, and maybe that would
be the end of humanitarian action,' he said.
Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, expressed concern about 'continued
aggressive military operations' by Serb forces and interference with
humanitarian relief missions, but gave no hint of any US plan to take part
in direct military action.
It remained his view that the US should not commit large numbers of ground
troops in former Yugoslavia, he said.
However, he said the US would be willing to consider proposals for deploying
UN forces in Macedonia as a preventive measure.
'The notion of trying to head off conflicts might well make sense under
certain circumstances,' he said.
The meeting underscored the growing importance of Nato's new peacekeeping
role in alliance planning. Ministers ordered work to be done on specific
measures to improve peacekeeping capabilities.
At the same time, several allies - notably Belgium and the Netherlands  -
came under strong criticism for undermining Nato force plans by making
larger-than-expected defence cuts.
Embattled Sarajevo, weakened by the latest Serb onslaught, was hit hard by
the first serious blast of winter yesterday, with temperatures hovering just
above zero and without power or water, Reuter adds.
Two flights by the UN Protection Force, intended as a test of airport
security ahead of the resumption of the UN airlift, were delayed by fog.
In Zagreb, a spokesman for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees said aid
flights, halted for the past 11 days by the fighting and attacks on two
relief planes, would restart on Tuesday at the earliest.

POLITICIANS from Tajikistan's old Soviet hierarchy assumed power in the
capital, Dushanbe, yesterday after irregular troops with armoured vehicles
seized the government's main building.
The new parliamentary speaker, Mr Imamali Rakhmanov, entered Dushanbe after
a week of fighting in and around the city, according to the deputy chief of
Russian forces in Tajikistan.
Russian Colonel Anatoly Ivlev said Mr Rakhmanov, becoming head of state
after the collapse of the Islamic-dominated coalition government,
immediately began peace talks with his opponents.
The development could help stabilise the Central Asian republic of 5m
people, where dozens of private militias have vied for power for months.
For now, Tajikistan's Islamic politicians, whose strength had risen all
year, have lost any role in government and are likely to make peace with Mr
Rakhmanov.
But there were signs that ethnic tension could give rise to new violence in
Tajikistan, where hundreds have died in fighting in the past year and more
than 200,000 have fled their homes.
Tajikistan's old-guard leadership, composed mostly of hard-line Soviet era
politicans and industrialists, officially overturned the former government
three weeks ago.
It did so by militarily crushing Islamic-dominated troops outside Dushanbe
and then - with the coalition government stripped of its muscle - having the
old guard-dominated parliament vote their opponents out of power.
Until yesterday, the Islamic forces continued to hold out in Dushanbe.
But my mid-morning, armoured forces loyal to Mr Rakhmanov seized most of the
capital's key installations - the presidential palace, parliament, the KGB
building and the interior ministry. That gave Mr Rakhmanov the security to
enter the capital.
While politicians have profited from Tajikistan's war, it is essentially a
battle between traditional ethnic enemies - clans from the nation's Garm and
Kulyab regions. The former largely backs the Islamic coalition, while Kulyab
supports the Soviet era elite.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Lombard League hopes to clean up in local polls: With many
established politicians accused of corruption, northern Italy's regional
party is gaining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARESE, with its neatly parked cars, pedestrian zones, clean streets,
expensive shops and hard-working people, epitomises the numerous provincial
towns in the northern industrial belt around Milan that have become
seriously rich in the past 30 years.
As the Christmas decorations go up and the first snows fall, there is little
to suggest these solid citizens are protagonists of epoch-making municipal
elections. But when it votes tomorrow and on Monday, Varese could become the
first city to elect a mayor of the populist Lombard League, the political
movement sweeping all before it in northern Italy.
'What happens here will have repercussions throughout northern Italy,' says
Mr Roberto Maroni, deputy head of the League parliamentary group and one of
the organisers of the Varese campaign. 'If we have a strong showing, all the
other municipal administrations in the north where the traditional parties
have lost their credibility will be under threat and risk early elections.'
The vote - which also takes place in the nearby town of Monza and more than
50 others throughout Italy - is the first serious electoral test of the
political parties since the April general election. It will determine not
only how far the long-ruling Christian Democrats and Socialists have lost
support but also indicate the extent of the growing political divide between
north and south.
The League needs a good showing in Varese, the home town of Mr Umberto
Bossi, the movement's leader. Polls suggest it could win well over 35 per
cent of the vote, compared with 20 per cent in 1990 municipal elections and
27 per cent in April. Varese, with a population of 88,000, is feeling the
political earthquake that has hit the north in the past year as a result of
investigations into municipal corruption by zealous magistrates. 'The entire
leadership of the Christian Democrats and Socialists have been wiped out by
the corruption scandal,' says Mr Roberto Maroni, deputy head of the League
parliamentary group.
Since June no fewer than 40 party officials - all but two from the Christian
Democrats and Socialists - have been arrested or are under investigation on
suspected corruption charges. Of the eight parliamentary representatives
elected in April, only the four League members are not under investigation
for alleged corruption. Those arrested include two former mayors.
The decapitation of the ruling elite, which also extends to former members
of the communist party reformed into the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS),
makes it easy to see why the League has become so popular.
'Our support is from the small and medium-sized industrialists, not big
business, from artisans and especially among the young. We are getting votes
from across the political spectrum as well as from people who have
previously been apolitical,' says Mr Maroni.
While the Christian Democrats and Socialists have been struggling to find
candidates and rebuild demoralised organisations with much reduced funds,
the League has prepared a 21-page programme of action.
If Mr Guiseppe Leone, a 47-year-old architect, close friend of Mr Bossi and
a League founder, becomes mayor, he plans radical overhaul of the
administration. This would include creation of a 'citizen manager' to
oversee the administration.
'At present our annual budget of L160bn (Pounds 73m) is eaten up 80 per cent
by current expenditure,' says Mr Maroni. To raise money, the League aims to
privatise local transport, gas and water supplies and sell off municipally
owned assets such as a milk plant.
Control of those authorities and their patronage in jobs and contracts has
been the source of the traditional parties' power. It also explains why in
Varese, as in other towns throughout Italy, the politicians have always
concentrated far more on manipulating power at a local rather than a
national level.
Not everyone is happy about the League's ascendancy. The Industrialists'
Union distrusts the virulent tone of the League's diatribes against 'the
robbers of Rome' and its threat to separate the north from the rest of
Italy.
The left sees dangerous neo-fascist tendencies in the League's contempt for
southerners and undertones of racism in its desire to rid the town of non-EC
immigrants. The church, always a pillar of the Christian Democrats, believes
the League is too secular and materialistic.
Although combined opposition to the League is strong, it remains disparate.
Nevertheless, when the League won a third of the vote in local elections in
September in Mantua, every other party combined to prevent it taking power.
As a result local government in Mantua is deadlocked and new elections will
have to be held next year.
'The Mantua experience won't be repeated here,' says Mr Maroni. 'The
political parties weren't ready for Mantua: they were still digesting their
drubbing in the April general elections. Here we believe we can form an
administration, probably with the PDS.'
The PDS might seem odd bedfellows but the left-wing party is anxious to take
advantage of the disarray of its traditional rivals and retain its influence
in northern municipal affairs. Mr Maroni is convinced that if such an
alliance occurs, it could be repeated elsewhere, particularly in Milan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH LESS than three weeks to go until the single European market is born,
EC Commission officials are being obliged to take an interest in British
pornography.
Brussels has received a number of inquiries from 'small UK importers',
questioning whether British customs authorities have the right to impound
certain magazines and videos.
The importers say the pornography - mainly Dutch - is no worse than items
made in Britain and sold as sex education videos and manuals in High Street
newsagents and bookshops.
Brussels officials will have to decide whether the UK is discriminating
against foreign pornography and whether the British authorities should be
able to continue to control the import of videos, magazines and sex aids at
the border after January 1.
If the importers' claim can be proved, then Britain is almost certainly
breaking EC law.
So far there has been no formal complaint and no inquiry has been opened.
What's more, the Commission has no objection to EC countries outlawing
certain types of pornography on moral grounds, and certainly does not want
to be cast as the arbiter of decency in such a case.
A much higher priority is being given to the question of border controls on
pornography, which, like all frontier checks on goods, should disappear on
January 1.
On Thursday, Britain will chair the final meeting of internal market
ministers before declaring Europe open for business. One of the UK's
priorities will be the abolition of systematic frontier controls on goods.
As one British official pointed out yesterday, 'removal of border controls
won't mean that Dutch porn can flood into the UK'. Instead, checks will be
based on intelligence information.
But, as Commission officials point out, if the checks are too heavy - and
carried out exclusively at border crossings - Britain may find itself in
front of the European Court for breaking single market rules on the free
movement of goods.

SWITZERLAND'S economy minister, Mr Jean-Pascal Delamuraz, said yesterday his
government would not withdraw its application to join the European
Community. This is in spite of last Sunday's vote rejecting Swiss membership
of the European Economic Area, which extends the EC's single market to
members of the European Free Trade Association.
Mr Delamuraz, a fervent pro-European, said the government had a duty to keep
Switzerland's options open, even though EC membership was not a question of
next year or the year after. He was speaking after an Efta ministerial
meeting he described as one of 'shame' for Switzerland, a founder member.
The country renounced its turn to the rotating presidency for the next
half-year, when the EEA will be the main focus of Efta activity, and was
barred from taking part in the discussions on the EEA's future.
Ministers from the other six Efta countries urged rapid entry into force of
the EEA, now delayed beyond its planned starting date of January 1993.
Their communique called for a diplomatic conference with the EC to be held
in January to approve 'technical adaptations' to the EEA accord, enabling it
to enter into force 'at the earliest possible date in the first half of
1993'.
'We hope there will be no renegotiation of the EEA,' said Mr Bjorn Tore
Godal, Norway's trade minister, who chaired the two-day meeting.
The main stumbling block concerns the fund Efta members agreed to set up to
aid poorer EC regions, worth Ecu2bn (Pounds 1.57bn) over five years, to
which Switzerland was due to contribute 27 per cent. The remaining six -
Austria, Finland, Iceland, Liechtenstein (which votes on the EEA tomorrow),
Norway and Sweden - will ask the EC to accept a simple deduction of the
Swiss contribution. But Spain has said other Efta members should make up the
difference.
If Liechtenstein accepts the treaty, it will somehow have to square its EEA
membership with its customs and currency union with Switzerland.
Other Europeans might worry that Liechtenstein would become Switzerland's
furtive path for gaining EEA advantages without joining.
Normally, Liechtensteiners would follow the Swiss. But the reigning prince,
Hans-Adam II, has campaigned hard for the EEA, even threatening to dissolve
parliament in October if it would not schedule Liechtenstein's referendum
before the Swiss one.
The prince now looks clever to have given way. The Swiss have been so torn
by remorse since their rejection of the EEA that wavering Liechtensteiners
may tip the result in favour.

<TEXT>
PROGRESS towards European monetary union will be slowed if all 12 central
banks are not freed from political ties as soon as possible, Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said yesterday.
Any further delay will also cast into doubt some governments' declared
ambitions for Emu, he said in a speech in Bangkok. He reminded those
governments still to cede full control to their state banks, including the
British and French, that independence had been promised for the future
European central bank.
However, he suggested, such an institution needed time to develop the
necessary reputation and credibility.
'It is desirable for all national central banks to be given full monetary
policy autonomy as soon as possible, and not merely immediately before the
transition to the third stage (of Emu, in 1999) when the establishment of
the European Central Bank will also have been completed,' he said.
Mr Schlesinger, who has recently sharpened his criticism of key elements in
the Emu project and weaknesses in its structure, also reviewed his
long-standing doubts about the timetable.
It was an open question, he said, if more than half the EC members - the
necessary quota - would be able to meet the convergence criteria in time for
stage two of Emu, due in 1997. At present only two or three countries met
the requirements, and 'Germany cannot be counted among them', although
'Germany and some other countries may well be prepared' by 1996.
He also showed his unhappiness about obligatory interventions in foreign
exchange markets laid down in the rules governing of the European exchange
rate mechanism.
Mr Schlesinger, who recently described the intervention mechanism as an
incentive to speculators, added yesterday that it impinged on central banks'
independence.
'If the rules of such a system are applied appropriately, undue tensions
need not occur.
'Exchange rate adjustments through realignments must be effected in good
time and noiselessly,' he said.
He blamed recent turbulence, which resulted in the withdrawal of sterling
and the lira from the ERM, on the widely held belief 'that we were living in
a de facto European monetary union. . . which was not and is not yet the
case'.

<TEXT>
A SENIOR Socialist yesterday launched an 11th-hour bid to save next year's
French grand prix, after the organisers struck it off the calendar for the
first time in 37 years because of stringent curbs on tobacco advertising.
Mr Michel Charasse, a cigar-smoking former budget minister and now a member
of the Senate, the French parliament's upper house, has proposed amending a
law against tobacco advertising on television, to allow cars to carry
sponsorship stickers.
If the senate adopts Mr Charasse's amendment, due for debate next week, it
will go on to the National Assembly, which must also give its accord.
Tobacco sponsorship is worth an estimated FFr500m (Pounds 61m) a year to
French motor racing.
He was stirred into action by the previous day's decision by Fisa, the world
motor racing federation, to shelve the French grand prix, after courts
imposed heavy fines on Renault and the Williams grand prix team for breaking
the law. TF1, France's leading television station, also faces court action.
To rub salt into the wound, Fisa said the French grand prix could be held
elsewhere in Europe. The race was to be held near Nevers, where the mayor
happens to be Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister.
Formula One is not the only event to suffer. Competitors in next January's
Paris-Dakar rally are down 50 per cent and the motorcycling grand prix is
under threat.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Travel and tourism to account for 13% of consumer spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE travel and tourism industry is expected to contribute Dollars 3,500bn to
the world economy in 1993 - a 20 per cent increase on its Dollars 2,900bn
contribution in 1990, according to Wharton Econometric Forecasting in a
study commissioned by the World Travel and Tourism Council.*
'The challenge for both governments and our industry is to lift our vision
above today's economic trenches to the renewed growth, market dynamism and
competitive opportunity beckoning on the horizon,' said Mr James D Robinson
III, Chairman of American Express and chairman of the World Travel &amp; Tourism
Council, in a comment on the study.
He called for policies to liberalise markets, improve infrastructure, and
eliminate bureaucratic trading barriers, at the same time emphasising that
the sector must expand 'in harmony with the environment'.
The study predicts that the industry will account for 127m jobs worldwide by
next year. It will attract Dollars 422bn in investment (6.7 per cent of the
expected world total) and will account for Dollars 2,000bn in consumer
spending - perhaps 13 per cent of all consumer spending.
The importance of the sector is consistently underestimated, according to
Wharton Econometrics, which shows in a survey of 20 countries that
policymakers see it as the eighth most important economic contributor. Their
study shows travel and tourism as the world's biggest in 1990, and likely to
remain so into the 21st century.
Looking ahead to the year 2005, the study warns of increasing congestion in
the air, increasing attention to environmental issues, and the emergence of
ecotourism and rural tourism as new growth areas.
It predicts a real compound growth for the industry of 3.9 per cent, with
its global economic contribution doubling to Dollars 9,673bn in nominal
terms, and consumer spending on travel and tourism up to Dollars 5,800bn in
nominal terms. A further 40m jobs will be created, lifting the world total
to almost 170m.
Wharton Econometrics based its projections on methods proposed by the
Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the United
Nations and the World Tourism Council (WTC).

FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Leaders order action on growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders yesterday told their economics and finance
ministers to prepare a growth initiative for the EC amid growing concern
about rising unemployment in the 12 member states.
British officials reported that a meeting yesterday of finance ministers
attending the Edinburgh summit took a bleak view of the EC's economic
prospects next year. No one was bullish, while most ministers expected a
slowdown and some a drift into recession. Against this grim background, the
ministers were ordered to put forward ways of injecting more growth into the
Community economy today on the second day of the summit.
At the national level the growth initiative will urge governments to divert
public spending to capital projects to encourage investment and boost
business confidence. At the Community level, the ministers discussed EC
Commission proposals to increase lending by the European Investment Bank and
the possible creation of a European Investment Fund to guarantee investments
in infrastructure and small and medium sized businesses.
The commission has proposed a boost of about Ecu5bn (Pounds 4bn) to EIB
lending within the EC and an investment fund with a subscribed capital of
Ecu2bn that could guarantee projects with a value of up to Ecu6bn.
Ministers yesterday expressed concern about Europe's worsening employment
prospects. The Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development recently forecast that unemployment in its European member
states (which include non-EC as well as EC nations) would average 10.4 per
cent of the labour force next year against expectations six months ago of
9.3 per cent for next year.
However, the ministers have only limited scope to influence their economies
through fiscal policy. They agreed yesterday there was little room for
manoeuvre on public spending.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, outlined Britain's recent Autumn Statement
strategy of giving priority to capital spending over current expenditure in
departmental spending plans for the coming financial year.
A number of ministers urged policies to restrain public sector wages with
some calling for wage restraint in the private sector.
The growth package will reaffirm the EC member states' commitment to medium
term economic objectives such as low inflation, sustainable growth, open
markets and sound public finances.
The finance ministers yesterday stressed the importance of controlling
inflation, underlining that this was the key to their economies meeting the
strict economic convergence criteria needed for economic and monetary union
under the Maastricht Treaty.
The UK presidency yesterday circulated a 20-page document outlining economic
policy options for next year. The document forecast that growth in the
community would be 1 per cent this year and unlikely to exceed 1 per cent in
1993. It underlined the importance of making markets function more smoothly.

Danish voters would approve the Maastricht treaty by a comfortable majority
in a second referendum, according to an opinion poll yesterday, writes
Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The poll showed 51 per cent would be in favour with 37 per cent against and
12 per cent undecided if the government reached a settlement with its
Community partners along the lines of the Danish compromise proposal.
The Yes vote rises to 61 per cent if the left-wing Social People's party
backs an Edinburgh settlement.
Mr Poul Schluter, Denmark's prime minister, has said Denmark would have to
leave the EC if the treaty was defeated in a second referendum.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Greece blocks Macedonia deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community foreign ministers yesterday failed to agree on the
recognition of the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, after Greece had
refused to accept such a move as long as the country used the name
Macedonia.
Following what the Greek foreign minister, Mr Mihalis Papaconstantinou,
described as 'very long and very cruel' discussions, the ministers decided
to refer the problem to their heads of government, meeting in Edinburgh for
a two-day European summit which is due to end tonight.
Greece has long argued that, if the former Yugoslav republic wins
international recognition under the name Macedonia, it is likely to provoke
territorial claims by militant nationalists in that ethnically diverse
country on the northern Greek province of the same name.
Compromise proposals by an EC presidency envoy, Mr Robin O'Neill, a former
British ambassador to Belgium, which would incorporate the name Macedonia in
a distinctive designation such as the Macedonian republic of Skopje (its
capital) or the Republic of Northern Macedonia have also been rejected by
the Greeks.
In a letter to Mr John Major, the British prime minister and current EC
president, Mr Constantine Mitsotakis, Greek premier, reminded Community
leaders that, in their Lisbon declaration of June this year, they had
specifically undertaken to recognise the former Yugoslav republic only under
a name which did not include the term Macedonia.
On the basis of that declaration, Mr Mitsotakis added, the Greek government
had undertaken 'a series of positive initiatives' towards Skopje, 'in order
to help lessen tensions and build confidence between us', including a clear
guarantee of its territorial integrity.
'It is crucial, therefore, that we demonstrate that we mean what we say by
reaffirming the Lisbon decision here in Edinburgh,' Mr Mitsotakis said.
Greek opposition to the recognition of Macedonia has caused increasing
irritation among governments of other member countries, particularly since
Greece has been contributing to the economic difficulties of the republic by
holding back oil deliveries for which Macedonia has already paid.
That irritation has been compounded by evidence that Greek companies were
systematically breaking the UN trade embargo against Serbia.
Even if EC leaders find no solution to the problem of recognition, the UK
presidency hopes it can persuade its partners to accept an interim solution
under which Macedonia would become a member of the International Monetary
Fund and be able to benefit from international financial aid.

Greece has long argued that, if the former Yugoslav republic wins
international recognition under the name Macedonia, it is likely to provoke
territorial claims by militant nationalists in that ethnically diverse

Compromise proposals by a special EC presidency envoy, Mr Robin O'Neill, a
former British ambassador to Belgium, which would incorporate the name
Macedonia in a distinctive designation such as the Macedonian republic of
Skopje (its capital) or the Republic of Northern Macedonia have also been
rejected by the Greeks.
In a letter to Mr John Major, the British prime minister and current EC

only offers of economic assistance but a clear guarantee of its territorial
integrity.
'It is crucial, therefore, that we demonstrate that we mean what we say by
reaffirming the Lisbon decision here in Edinburgh,' Mr Mitsotakis said,
adding that this was all the more important since Mr Bill Clinton, the US
president-elect had 'unequivocally declared' support for the Lisbon
declaration.
Greek opposition to the recognition of Macedonia has caused increasing
irritation among governments of other member countries, particularly since
Greece has been contributing to the economic difficulties of the republic by
holding back oil deliveries for which Macedonia has already paid.
That irritation has been compounded by evidence made public by the Spanish
European commissioner for Mediterranean affairs, Mr Abel Matutes, that Greek
companies were systematically breaking the United Nations trade embargo
against Serbia. While withholding deliveries to Macedonia, they were sending
thousands of tonnes of oil to other parts of the former Yugoslavia.
Even if the EC leaders fail to find a solution to the problem of
recognition, the UK presidency hopes it can persuade its partners to accept
an interim solution under which Macedonia would become a member of the
International Monetary Fund and thus be able to benefit from international
financial aid.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: We're all in it together, Major tells
EC leaders - The British premier's handling of the summit, where he won
unexpected praise from the French
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was one simple premise underlying Mr John Major's handling of the
summit yesterday: the price of failure for Europe would be as great as, if
not greater than, it would be for Britain.
Put another way, he needed a successful outcome to cope with the deep
ambivalence within the Conservative party over Britain's place in Europe.
But his continental partners needed the same success to re-establish their
own confidence in the direction for the Community set at Maastricht. By last
night the signs were that the message had been absorbed by most if not all
of the EC leaders in Edinburgh.
The prime minister cast himself as the honest broker, committed to putting
the community of interest above the differences dividing fellow heads of
state. The strategy was only partially successful. Mr Jacques Delors did not
disguise his irritation with the minimalist British approach to the
expansion of the Community budget. Germany was joined by Spain, Portugal and
a number of other countries in demanding that Mr Major set a mid-1993
deadline for British ratification of Maastricht. He could not.
But if the events of the past few months have indeed left Britain, along
with Denmark, pulled along precariously on the Community's coat-tails, Mr
Major was adept enough in Edinburgh to hide the reality. Around the national
briefing rooms in the press centre there were few of the familiar charges
that Britain had once again found itself on the wrong side of an 11 to 1
split. Even talk of a 10 to 2 division tended to be sotto voce.
To the delight of British officials Mr Major found himself the beneficiary
of a inexplicable charm offensive by President Francois Mitterrand. First Mr
Mitterrand broke the habit of a lifetime and arrived early at the summit to
have dinner with his host. Then he spoke kindly of a British prime minister.
French ministers have spent weeks pouring scorn on Britain's handling of the
presidency.
Mr Mitterrand - perhaps because French views on Denmark, the budget and
enlargement have more in common with London's than he would care to admit -
has now told the same ministers to substitute praise for insults. He led the
way, describing the UK compromise on the Danish question as subtle and
skilful.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl voiced serious reservations on the formula for
Denmark. But in return for Mr Major's private assurance that a successful
summit would pave the way for the return of the Maastricht bill to the House
of Commons early in the New Year, he seemed disinclined to stand in the way
of an agreement. The prime minister has been at pains to make it clear to
his counterparts that eventual ratification at Westminster lies in their
hands at much as his. The harder they make life for him, the harder he will
find it to defeat the Tory Euro-sceptics.
So for all the ritual hand-wringing yesterday by Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the
Foreign Office minister responsible for Europe, and the real anger of Spain
over the budget proposals, the prime minister appeared convinced that a deal
could be struck before the summit winds up later today. His threat to keep
the leaders in Holyrood Palace throughout the afternoon and evening should
help to concentrate minds on agreeent.
Britain's argument that it was time for the Community to resolve its
internal squabbles carried more force than hitherto. Traditionally, the
British case for a more outward-looking Community has provoked the
justifiable suspicion that it was seeking merely to obstruct closer
integration.
With Russia on the verge of another coup, the conflict in Bosnia theatening
to engulf the Balkans and a new president about to enter the White House,
the case for looking outwards rather than inwards is compelling. So too is
the threat from the financial markets - underlined again yesterday - that
continued paralysis in the Community will be a useful excuse to renew their
onslaught on the European exchange rate mechanism.
There is thus an attractive logic to Mr Major's view that those in the
vanguard of European integration share for the moment a coincidence of
interest with those in the rear. The events of the past few months have
halted the conveyor belt to federalism. European governments have been left
groping for an alternative.
But there is also an important caveat. If Edinburgh does produce something
that can be hailed as a success Mr Major cannot delay indefinitely. His
partners will have offered him a breathing space to catch up. But no one in
Edinburgh was in any doubt yesterday that the rest of Europe will not wait
forever - for Denmark or for Britain.

Summit Diary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR managed to start the summit with an auspicious anecdote on its
imposing venue, Holyrood Palace.
It was founded, quoth he, by David the First in 1128, after he had been
attacked by an 'enraged stag' in the nearby park, on the feast of the
exaltation of the cross. Legend has it that he was saved by the providential
appearance of a cross between the stag's antlers.
But Mr Major was able to reveal that the story had actually been filched
from another legend, concerning St Hubert, the eighth-century Bishop of -
yes, you guessed it - Maastricht.
It remains to be seen whether this historical link between a British
institution and the Dutch city will trump a later one.
Guy Fawkes, the only man ever to enter the Houses of Parliament with
honourable intentions as the refrain goes, is also said to have been
resident in Maastricht some 10 years before he conceived his incendiary
plot.
*****
President Francois Mitterrand is also legendary, particularly for turning up
at summits late and last, to underline his grandeur as sole head of state in
the EC's heads of government club.
Not this time, since he had an eve-of-summit dinner appointment with Mr
Major. This, UK and French officials said, went very well, but Mr Albert
Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister, may be regretting Mr Mitterrand's
punctuality, as well as wondering what time the dinner ended.
For at 4.10am yesterday, Mr Reynolds had to leap out of his bed, being
rained on from an overflowing bath in the room above - Mr Mitterrand's.
*****
The citizens of Edinburgh have been treated to a bewildering display of
Euro-demonstrations - quite apart from the more familiar Scottish National
Party rally planned for midday today.
A hundred Greek mayors filing behind a banner proclaiming 'Alexander the
Great was Greek not Slav' did not appear to have any obvious relation to the
sort of nationalism Scots are used to. It was but one of a swirl of protests
across the city by Greeks against recognition of the former Yugoslav
republic of Macedonia by that name.
This was in Prince's Street. Across on Carlton Hill, the GMB trade union was
organising a procession of 11 horses and a mule - to highlight Mr Major's
government's stubborn, two-speed opting out of the EC's Social Charter.
The pro-Europeans weren't having it all their own way, however. In Frederick
Street, the Consumers' Association opened a 'Delors Deli', displaying food
with two price tags, one with the real cost to the consumer as a result of
the Common Agricultural Policy, the other at cheaper world prices.
*****
The Royal Bank of Scotland, one of the three Scottish note issuing banks,
was doing a roaring trade in its commemorative issue of Euro-Scottish pound
notes.
The bank, which has printed 2m of the special bits of paper, came up with
the ultimate Euro-gift for the 13 main summit participants (including
Jacques Delors): paperweights made up of notes with the numbers 1992001 up
to 1992013. It is also selling 50,000 'collectors' packs' at Pounds 3 a
time. The bank dislikes the description 'gimmick', preferring to call the
promotion 'unusual but appropriate'.

bacon

DENMARK yesterday received a blunt warning from its EC partners about the
risks of delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty.
During the opening session at the Edinburgh summit, Germany, Spain and
others made clear that if the Twelve could not agree on Denmark's demands
for legally-binding opt-outs on Maastricht, the others would press ahead
regardless.
Despite the tough talk, all parties expressed hope that a deal on the Danish
question could be reached today when the UK presidency presents a third
revised draft. 'A lot of this argument is inevitable theatre,' commented a
British official, who also noted a more accommodating French attitude.
The chief difficulty facing the Twelve is how to wrap Danish demands for
opt-outs on a common European currency, common defence policy, EC
citizenship and common justice and immigration policies in a quasi-treaty
form.
Danish prime minister Poul Schluter warned yesterday that the text must be
strong enough to sway voters in a second referendum on Maastricht next April
or May; if not, there would be no treaty.
The UK, working closely with top lawyers in Brussels, has suggested that EC
leaders take a 'decision'. Although a 'decision' would have the force of
international law, it would not amount to renegotiation of the treaty or
require re-ratification of Maastricht, Mr Jean-Claude Piris, head of the
European Council's legal service told EC leaders.
Spain, Germany, Italy, and Portugal all expressed doubts about the word
'decision", offering weaker alternatives such as a 'resolution' or a
'declaration' which they said would not have to be presented to their
national parliaments.
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's complaints were unexpected, but may have
been intended to show the purists such as Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain that he was no pushover.
After the opening session, Mr Dieter Vogel, chief German spokesman, said
pointedly that he could not imagine that the Danish question 'would founder
on one word'.
But several members expressed irritation when Mr Schluter presented a more
expansive demand for exemption from a common EC defence policy set out in
the Maastricht treaty.
Another potential difficulty concerns Danish demands for an agreement which
is limitless in time. Luxembourg officials said this risked prejudging the
planned review of Maastricht at a conference in 1996, where
intergovernmental co-operation on justice and immigration might become a
Community matter.
On a harsh interpretation, the Danes could be accused of holding back the
development of the EC, which is why a senior Brussels official said the
Danish question 'all comes down to presentation - and political mood'.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Fishermen stage protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FISHERMEN marched through Edinburgh yesterday to demonstrate their anger at
the EC common fisheries policy and at the UK government's policy towards the
fishing industry.
Fishermen say quotas imposed under the common fisheries policy are too tight
and deprive fishermen of income, or 'criminalise' them by obliging them to
sell illegally caught fish on the black market.
In recent weeks Scottish boats have had to tie up in port after exhausting
their quotas of haddock, while French and Spanish boats have landed
legitimately caught fish in Scottish ports.
The fishermen are also angry at the government's Seafish Conservation Bill,
which was approved by the House of Commons this week. They believe the
Pounds 25m it provides for decommissioning surplus boats is too little and
the tie-up provisions are too draconian.
Mr Elliot Morley, MP, Labour's fisheries spokesman, said the government's
measures were 'too little, too late'.
Instead of sensible and effective conservation measures, 'what we are
getting is an inappropriate market approach that results in decommissioning
by bankruptcy.'
He said: 'The one thing this government has done for the fishing industry is
to unite it.'
Mr Alex Salmond, leader of the Scottish National Party, warned the
government that the campaign against its fisheries policy would continue
'until justice is achieved for fishing communities.
'People are rallying behind our fishermen in the same way they rallied
behind the mining communities. We have the initiative and there is no mood
to let it slip.'
Police said about 3,500 fishermen took part in the march, which began within
sight of Holyrood Palace, where the EC heads of government were meeting, and
ended with a rally.
Organisers called it the biggest ever protest by British fishermen.
Meanwhile 1,200 ex-servicemen, clan chieftains and politicians demonstrated
at Edinburgh Castle in protest at government plans to merge four Scottish
regiments into two. The Keep our Scottish Battalions Campaign argues that
the regimental cuts are excessive and are inappropriate for Scotland, which
is one of the army's best recruiting areas.

FT  12 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Budget row threatens to undermine
summit objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC's north-south divide over a budget for the future financing of the
Community was last night threatening to poison efforts to get the Maastricht
treaty back on the rails, and start the process of opening up the EC to new
members.
It was feared the clash over money would result in the downgrading of other
Maastricht objectives - from beefed up research and development to the
common foreign and security policy - if large fiscal transfers to the EC
weaker economies had to come out of a restricted budget.
Ratification of the treaty, and agreement on the Delors II finance package,
are the two conditions the 12 set at the Lisbon summit for opening
negotiations with new applicants to the EC. The poorer countries are likely
to insist the EC sticks to these conditions.
They are the negotiating aces for Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece who
are insisting on a doubling of EC development aid. Both Mr Felipe Gonzalez,
the Spanish prime minister, and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese
premier, said yesterday they wanted a significantly improved finance
package, and clear dates from Denmark and the UK on when they will ratify
the treaty. These were their conditions for starting 'informal' negotiations
on enlargement.
The four poorer countries led by Spain are rejecting the UK presidency's
latest financing proposals. These would raise the annual EC budget from
Ecu66.8bn (Pounds 54bn) this year to Ecu80.3bn by 1999, in today's money.
Commission president Jacques Delors' own compromise, scaling back sharply
his initial ambitions, is an increase to Ecu86.2bn in 1999. Under the
British plan, total regional and development funding would rise from
Ecu18.6bn now, to Ecu26.8bn in 1999, as against the Commission target of
Ecu30.2bn.
'The proposal of the presidency at this moment is not enough,' said Mr
Javier Solana, Spain's foreign minister. 'With that proposal we cannot meet
the obligations of the treaty.'
But the drive for 'cohesion' - meaning increased budget transfers from the
north and centre of the Community to the south and periphery - could have as
its price the sacrifice of common policies for the EC as a whole, in areas
like transport, the environment, research, and pan-European infrastructure.
If, as optimistic Irish and German officials reckoned yesterday, a
'split-the-difference' compromise is reached tonight, there will not be much
money left over. This is Mr Delors' particular anguish.
He pointed out in a letter to EC leaders that whereas funding to the
cohesion countries reaches 90m people, a further 130m Europeans are served
by structural funds - aid for industrially stricken areas, training the
long-term and young unemployed, and rural development.
With the US and Japan stepping up their already much larger research effort,
the Commission president said his compromise plan to increase EC research
spending by an average 4.4 per cent a year had been whittled down in the UK
figures to a mere 0.5 per cent a year (Mr Delors' original proposal was for
an annual increase of 11.5 per cent).
Helping to stimulate jobs and helping people whose jobs are at risk through
restructuring is, in the Delors view, part of the essence of a Europe
constructed for its citizens.
'You can't continue with the Community in the form it was relaunched in from
1985 with these figures on the table. It's not a question of the Commission
having some expensive plaything,' Mr Delors told journalists on the eve of
the summit. 'It's a question of enabling each citizen to see what the
Community is about, a question of principle.'
'There won't be any common policies left to bring closer to the people,'
said one Irish official, alluding to the EC's 'subsidiarity' pledge to make
Community decision-making more decentralised and open.
Apart from the unyielding demands of the south, there is little or no room
to claw back money from the foreign or farm budgets. Increasing external
funding is one of the few areas of agreement; foreign policy 'is everybody's
hobby,' a German official said yesterday. And France is certain to demand an
increase in farm spending, as compensation for not pressing its hostility to
last month's farm trade deal with the US.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Behind The ERM Crisis: The day Germany planted a currency
time bomb - In an austere Frankfurt building on September 11, German
officials adopted a course that could change the monetary future of Europe.

IT WAS the Bundesbank that brought the phoney war surrounding Europe's
monetary future to an end.
At a secret meeting in its austere headquarters in northern Frankfurt on
Friday September 11, Helmut Schlesinger, the central bank's 68-year-old
president, gave Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl the figures that threatened
the end ofGermany's counter-inflation policy. They also put an explosive
charge under Europe's exchange rate mechanism - a time bomb which is still
ticking in spite of three re-alignments during the last three months. As a
nearby clock struck 6pm, the mood in Mr Schlesinger's 12th floor room was as
sombre as the all-black office furniture. Theo Waigel, German finance
minister, Hans Tietmeyer, Bundesbank vice-president, and Horst Kohler, the
energetic Finance Ministry state secretary, listened as Mr Schlesinger told
Germany's leader how the central bank had been forced to buy a record DM24bn
worth of Italian lire in the days before the meeting. The Bundesbank
president said the lire purchases, obligatory under the rules of the
European Monetary System, were swamping the bank's efforts to control
Germany's fast-expanding money supply. He asked the chancellor to approve
negotiations to realign currencies in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The move was to end nearly six years of exchange rate stability in the ERM.
That weekend, the Italian lira was devalued by 7 per cent and the Bundesbank
decided on modest cuts in its interest rates in an attempt to calm financial
markets. The package failed. Only days later, after unprecedented upheavals
on currency markets, came Black Wednesday: the Italian lira and sterling
were suspended from ERM membership, and the cause of European integration
was dealt a blow from which it still has to recover.
Since Black Wednesday, it has become clear that the crisis in the EMS goes
to the heart of the EC's future plans. Disarray in the ERM could at best
delay, and at worst destroy, the EC's hopes for economic and monetary union
by the end of this century. Even if it is ratified by all EC member states,
the Maastricht Treaty looks more like a formula for establishing a two- or
multi-speed Europe than a blueprint for union.
The EC's response to the monetary crisis has been slow. Its secretive
monetary committee - charged with finding ways of correcting 'fault lines'
in the system - has made scant progress in three meetings on the subject.
Its chairman, Jean-Claude Trichet, the director of the French Treasury, had
no conclusions to report to EC leaders during their summit in Edinburgh
which continues today.
However, while others have dallied, one institution has emerged with a clear
idea of what it wants from the wreckage. The Bundesbank sees a monetary
future for Europe: it will be designed and largely made in Germany.
In a series of speeches over the past two months, Mr Schlesinger, Mr
Tietmeyer, and Mr Otmar Issing, the Bundesbank's chief economist, have
spelled out a vision of Europe's future that amounts to monetary Darwinism,
or survival of the fittest.
Mr Schlesinger and his colleagues give public support to the Maastricht
Treaty goals of economic and monetary union. But at the same time, they
express doubt about the effectiveness of the economic convergence criteria
in the treaty and its lack of clarity about a political union to provide
democratic support for the goals of a single European currency and central
bank.
The Bundesbank's top decision makers insist that there can be no compromise
in Europe with their objective of achieving price stability. Countries are
welcome to try to fix their currencies to the D-Mark, but it is up to them
to ensure that their economic fundamentals - such as inflation,
international competitiveness and public finances - are in order.
This rigorous approach to monetary union was spelt out most explicitly by Mr
Tietmeyer in early November when he spoke to a conference of bankers in the
German Alpine resort of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The speech, which contrary
to usual practice was not given wide distribution by the Bundesbank,
underlined the view that successful monetary union in Europe would depend on
the 'right choice of participating countries'. He explicitly rejected the
myth that all EC nations could proceed together to union.
The Bundesbank's Darwinian approach to Emu has become more pronounced since
September. During the weekend of September 12 and 13 Mr Schlesinger had
rallied his colleagues in the Bundesbank central council to agree to a  1/4
percentage point drop in Germany's Lombard rate, plus  1/2 point cuts in its
discount and money market rates, in support of the 7 per cent lira
devaluation.
When the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo were devalued by 6 per cent on
November 22, by contrast, the Bundesbank set its face against compromising
its strict anti-inflationary monetary policy any further. It made no move to
cut interest rates.
The tough line has continued. On December 1, in a speech at Cologne
university, Mr Schlesinger sharply criticised those who sought to put
Germany under moral pressure to ease its monetary policy while it was still
struggling to bring its inflation problem under control.
The Bundesbank president has also attacked aspects of the ERM's operations,
notably the obligation on strong currency countries to provide unlimited
support for weak currencies at their lower intervention points. Such
intervention, he said, encouraged speculation.
Mr Schlesinger's remarks have created the impression that the Bundesbank is
hostile to the ERM. The truth is more subtle. The Bundesbank aim is to move
forward by way of the past: it wants the ERM to revert to the original
concept of fixed but adjustable parities, instead of the quasi-fixed
exchange rate system that evolved between the last significant realignment
in January 1987 and the tensions of this year.
An important element of the Bundesbank's strategy is to breathe new life
into the so-called Basle-Nyborg agreement of autumn 1987, in which EC
central bankers and finance ministers revised the rules of the ERM for
dealing with currency crises.
That agreement decided that currency weakness should be tackled at first by
intervention which should be 'intra-marginal' or above the level at which
central banks are obliged to support weak currencies in the ERM. This has
the effect under EMS rules of placing the risk of losses from intervention
with the central bank of the weak currency country. If selling pressure
continued, the country with a weak currency should raise interest rates. The
third step would be a realignment of EMS parities that, ideally, would be
timely enough to avoid a currency crisis.
These principles have underpinned the Bundesbank's approach to the ERM since
September. They have support in the ERM's hard currency 'core' countries,
which have staked their whole credibility in economic policy on keeping
their currencies in line with the D-Mark.
So far the core nations have been successful in this effort, in spite of the
continuing strains in the system. Indeed, monetary officials interviewed
recently in several continental countries appeared quietly confident that
Germany, France, the Benelux countries and most probably Ireland and Denmark
would soon be able to form a bloc in which parities stay unchanged. These
could be joined by Austria, which has religiously linked its currency to the
D-Mark for many years in spite of not being a member of the EC.
That the Bundesbank is now setting the agenda for Europe's monetary future
shows how far this autumn's troubles have destroyed the assumption that the
EMS could function smoothly as a 'glide path' for monetary union in Europe.
The ERM acts as the first phase of the three-phase Maastricht plan to create
a single European currency, monetary policy and central bank by 1999 at the
latest.
But as the Bundesbank's influence has grown, so have the doubts.
Developments since Black Wednesday suggest that even the core countries of
the ERM may have difficulties in future living with the D-mark as Europe's
anchor currency. And that possibility has serious implications for the
Community's whole effort to move from the EMS to economic and monetary
union.
The EMS was conceived by then West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt and
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing as an antidote to the currency
instability and dollar weakness of the late 1970s. At its heart is the ERM,
a grid of exchange rate parities for EC member states, which limits the
movement of most against each other to 2.25 per cent either side of agreed
bilateral central rates.
Since the system started operating with eight currencies (the D-Mark, French
franc, the Dutch guilder, the Belgian and Luxembourg francs, the Danish
krone, Irish punt and Italian lira) in March 1979, its most important
exchange rate relationship has been between the French franc and D-Mark.
This was accentuated by the special arrangement for the Italian lira to
fluctuate up to six per cent either side of its central rates until January
1990 and the UK's decision to stay out of the ERM until October 1990.
Initially, the EMS was linked only tenuously to the idea of European union.
Its objective was the more modest one of creating a 'zone of monetary
stability in Europe' and it took several years - until 1983 - before it
began to fulfil this role.
It is not surprising that the Bundesbank wants to recapture the spirit of
the system's most successful period between 1983 and 1987. The Bundesbank
called the shots in the ERM for most of the 1980s. Although those years were
marked by occasional convulsions on currency markets and the odd acrimonious
realignment, they were also a period of steady economic growth and
convergence to lower inflation among the ERM member states.
After 1987, however, the environment in which the ERM operates changed in
several ways:
In the summer of 1988, EC leaders decided in Hanover to push ahead for
economic and monetary union. It was then, according to one long-serving
senior monetary official, that the system was 'hi-jacked' and those
officials who voiced scepticism about the goal of Emu were subjected to
'intellectual terrorism' by supporters of union grouped around Mr Jacques
Delors, the EC Commission president.
The ERM itself became a club that others wanted to join. The Euro-pessimism
of the early 1980s gave way to Euro-phoria. The success of the ERM countries
in achieving steady growth and, more especially, low inflation prompted
Spain to join in June 1989, followed by Britain in October 1990 and Portugal
in April this year.
The world was changing beyond the boundaries of the European Community. The
collapse of communism and the breaching of the Berlin Wall in November 1989
paved the way for German union and the eventual emergence of inflation as a
problem for the D-Mark, the ERM's anchor currency.
The potential for instability in the system was greatly increased by the
dismantling of exchange controls in the EC in line with the Community's
programme for creating a barrier-free internal market by the end of 1992.
By January this year, finance ministers and central bankers throughout the
EC were quietly congratulating themselves on five years of ERM tranquility.
'But there was an element of discomfort in those celebrations,' recalls one
senior monetary official. 'If you looked at all the indicators, there was
one group of countries (the original members minus Italy) which stayed close
to each other and another group (the newcomers with Italy) that was
diverging significantly in a lasting way.'
At the time, however, the financial markets ignored such discordant
developments as Germany's rising interest rates, Britain's continuing
recession, and Italy's ever-increasing debt burden. They remained mesmerised
by the drive towards Emu that reached its peak at last December's Maastricht
summit. There, EC heads of government had settled on a treaty envisaging the
creation of Emu by 1997 at the earliest and certainly no later than 1999. In
consequence, the ERM had for some time been operating in a perverse fashion,
with high inflation currencies, such as the Spanish peseta, emerging as the
strongest in the system because they were supported by high interest rates
and a belief that parities would not change.
It took the narrow Danish vote against Maastricht in the June 2 referendum
to shatter this uneasy equilibrium. In spite of a pro-Maastricht vote in the
Irish referendum a few weeks later, pressure began to build against the
existing currency relationships in the ERM.
It all came to a head in the September currency crisis, compounded by
political conflict and institutional and individual failures at all levels
among the EC member states.
It has become increasingly clear in the intervening weeks that Black
Wednesday was not just a debacle for the UK and Italy; the ejection of
sterling and the lira exposed a structural problem at the heart of the EMS.
John Major, the British prime minister, was mocked elsewhere in Europe when
he suggested at the time that the Community should seek to correct 'fault
lines' in the ERM. Now monetary officials are no longer so willing to
suggest that the UK and Italy were themselves largely to blame.
To be sure, both Italy and the UK had their weaknesses. Italy was losing the
battle to bring its bloated state deficits under control and was losing
competiveness against its EC trading partners.
Some continental officials, including Mr Schlesinger, thought that Britain
had a competitiveness problem that was highlighted by its continued large
current account deficit in a recession; they reckoned it had entered the ERM
at too ambitious a parity of DM2.95. Others believed that Britain failed to
anticipate the extent to which markets would test sterling in the system.
This fear was alive even before the UK joined the ERM. In 1989 Andre Szasz,
executive director of the Nederlandsche Bank, the Dutch central bank, warned
that Britain 'should be prepared - at least in the short run - to give
priority to the exchange rate objective' after ERM entry, implying the need
to raise interest rates even at times when this would be politically
unpopular and, in domestic terms, economically unjustified.
In August, the UK's failure to follow this advice helped prepare the ground
for sterling's eventual exit from the ERM. Although the pound had weakened -
passing at one point through the level that was supposed to trigger efforts
to defend the currency - Norman Lamont, the chancellor, refused to raise
interest rates. Indeed, in early August the government cut the returns on
its National Savings products to head off a rise in mortgage rates by UK
building societies, effectively telling financial markets that the UK could
not afford a politically damaging rise in bank base rates from 10 per cent
when the country was deep in recession.
Black Wednesday may have been climactic, but it was far from marking the end
of the EMS's troubles. Since September 16, the doubts about the system's
continuing viability - let alone the prospect of its paving the way for Emu
 -have stubbornly refused to go away.
The first warning sign was the intense speculative attack on the French
franc in September following the petit oui in favour of the Maastricht
Treaty in the September 20 referendum. In spite of sound economic
fundamentals, such as low inflation, stronger growth and healthier
government finances than those of Germany, the Bundesbank and Bank of France
had to buy FFr160bn in concerted intervention before the speculative wave
subsided.
That victory had required strong verbal support for the franc from the
German and French finance ministries and the two countries' central banks.
It is also thought that the Bundesbank provided a generous swap line to the
French central bank. Once the dust settled, the Bank of France had made an
estimated FFr1.2bn in profit at the speculators' expense. But victory was
not without its costs. It had entailed a temporary, but disruptive, increase
in French interest rates and spelled further problems for the system.
The French franc was again under pressure last month after the 6 per cent
devaluations of the Spanish peseta and Portuguese escudo on November 22. ERM
central banks have also been obliged to support the Irish punt and Danish
krone on a large scale. The Belgian National Bank, for example, had to buy
Dollars 1bn worth of Irish pounds in three hours one recent Friday morning.
At various times in the past three months, Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and
Norway have been forced to push interest rates to usurious levels in the
hope of maintaining their parities. These moves have had only limited
success. Norway was forced on Thursday to float its krone, rather than lose
all its currency reserves in a vain struggle to keep the currency pegged to
the Ecu, the weighted basket of EC currencies that some hope will develop
into a money for Europe. 'It became too hard to fight,' said central bank
director Leif Eide.
Three weeks before, Sweden abandoned its attempt to keep the krona tied to
the ERM after a huge outflow of capital from the country. The setback
experienced by Carl Bildt, the prime minister, was, if anything, greater
than that suffered by Mr Major on Black Wednesday. He was given just 10
minutes' notice of the move by central bank governor Bengt Dennis.
Sweden, like Britain two months earlier, was forced to float its currency
because a fixed exchange rate policy was no longer compatible with domestic
economic or political priorities. In Sweden's case, the final straw was the
failure of the opposition Social Democratic party to back government public
spending cuts in support of the krona. In Britain, the crucial moment had
come at 11am on Black Wednesday when Mr Lamont raised bank base rates to a
politically unacceptable and economically untenable 12 per cent only to be
met with continued selling of sterling.
But it is the link between the French franc and the D-mark - under pressure
again yesterday, with the Bundesbank having to support the franc in the
currency markets - that remains crucial to the survival of the ERM. If the
franc were forced to devalue it would be more than a savage blow to the
political prestige of President Mitterrand and his prime minister Pierre
Beregovoy, who has made the franc fort the centre of his economic policy. It
would demonstrate that the ERM was operating perversely by creating the
conditions for the depreciation of a currency - the franc - which in terms
of economic fundamentals deserves to be stronger than the D-Mark.
So far the core countries of the ERM have stayed loyal to the D-Mark with
senior officials confident that Germany will in time overcome its problems
of relatively high inflation and deficit financing in eastern Germany. It is
unlikely, however, that the system could survive a franc devaluation. It
would also be seriously weakened by the forced devaluation of either the
Danish krone or Irish punt.
The ERM faces a tense three months ahead of France's national assembly
election in March. So far bipartisan support for the franc fort policy has
held remarkably firm, in spite of economic slowdown in France and 3m
unemployed. But that united front may be cracking. This week Alain Madelin,
a senior member of ex-President Giscard d'Estaing's centrist UDF party, said
France should sever the franc's ties to the mark because of Germany's
economic problems. Little wonder that senior French monetary officials would
like to take the franc out of the firing line by moving rapidly to Emu.
This desire does not necessarily conflict with the Bundesbank's agenda,
calling for Emu on condition that Maastricht's strict economic convergence
conditions are met. One way of reconciling their viewpoints would be for the
core countries of the ERM to forge ever closer ties - culminating, perhaps,
in a de facto monetary union among themselves. In that case, the secret
meeting in the Bundesbank three months ago that triggered the ERM crisis
would also have prepared the ground for a Europe moving at two speeds, or
more.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Inflation drops to six-year low
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION fell to its lowest level for six years last month, as recent base
rate cuts drove mortgage interest payments lower. Official figures showed
yesterday that retail prices fell by 0.1 per cent in November bringing the
annual rate of increase to 3 per cent compared with 3.6 per cent in the year
to October.
Retail price inflation excluding mortgage interest payments - an underlying
measure favoured by the Treasury - fell to 3.6 per cent from 3.8 per cent in
October. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, whose target range for this
measure is 1-4 per cent, described the fall as 'very welcome news'.
'Clearly there is substantial disinflation in our economy,' he said.
In spite of the latest drop in inflation, Mr Lamont again damped hopes of an
early rate cut by insisting that he would not loosen monetary policy.
Speaking after the figures were released, he said: 'We need to be resolute
in the battle against inflation. We cannot give up on it.'
Glimmers of a recovery in retail sales were encouraged by an announcement
from the John Lewis Partnership, the department store chain, that Christmas
demand was starting to pick up.
Although total sales in the first week of this month were 1 per cent down on
the same week a year ago, the company said sales of video games, personal
computers and printers were buoyant.
'There is much left to play for and the next two to three weeks will be
crucial,' it said.
Yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that headline
inflation is now rising at its slowest rate since October 1986 when it was
also 3 per cent. It is expected to carry on falling in the new year as the
most recent base rate cut feeds through to the all-items index.
However, the CSO said that higher import prices after sterling's devaluation
in September had yet to affect prices.
Ms Harriet Harman, Labour's treasury spokesman, said: 'Of course low
inflation is important, but what people want to see is an end to rising
unemployment and a start to growth in the economy.'
Although lower mortgage payments were the main factor behind the sharp fall
in the headline rate, prices were depressed in virtually every component of
the RPI, particularly in seasonal foods, clothing and footwear.
International comparisons of consumer price indices show that the UK's
headline rate is less than the EC average of 4 per cent.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Summit moves closer to deal: Progress on Danish demands - UK
may concede bigger EC budget rise

BRITAIN last night signalled it was ready to give ground in its hard-line
stance on future EC financing as European leaders moved closer to agreement
on granting exemptions to Denmark on the Maastricht treaty.
British officials at the Edinburgh summit said they had to make a judgment
on whether the UK would get a better deal under its own presidency of the
EC, which expires at the end of the year, than under the forthcoming Danish
presidency.
This diplomatic move came at the end of a day in which progress on the
Danish question raised prospects of a successful outcome to the summit.
After a day of passionate debate and hard bargaining on the EC budget,
Britain's tactic of playing on leaders' fear of failure appeared to be
paying off.
It was clear, however, that Britain would be forced to allow a more generous
increase in the EC budget than it has proposed so far. German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl said more money had to be channelled to the poorer countries: 'I
am prepared to compromise.'
Other EC governments meanwhile warned Mr John Major, the prime minister,
that in return for a successful summit, he was expected to speed up British
ratification of Maastricht.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, described as 'nonsense' reports that
Mr Major would be forced to agree to a firm deadline. But several other
members said they wanted UK and Danish ratification by mid-1993.
France, which praised the work of the British presidency, said the EC had
gone '80 per cent' of the way towards a solution of Denmark's demands for
legally binding opt-outs on the Maastricht treaty, thus preparing for a
second Danish referendum, probably next May.
Mr Kohl's chief spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, said he could not imagine the
summit failing because of a dispute over legal niceties. Over lunch, other
EC leaders appealed to Denmark to end the uncertainty about Maastricht
which, they said, was paralysing the EC's work.
Mr Poul Schluter, Danish prime minister, acknowledged the dangers of
failure, saying there could not be a third referendum, and that Denmark
could not enjoy the rights of full EC membership in the event of another No
vote.
'It will be difficult, but I think we will eventually succeed because if we
don't the Maastricht treaty will not be implemented,' he said.
The leaders were also last night expected to wrap up agreement on
'subsidiarity' - decision-making at the lowest appropriate level. They
agreed to accept a list of European Commission draft directives to scrap,
including one on takeovers.
Mr Major stressed that the summit must also address, at length, low economic
growth and unemployment in the EC. With job losses continuing to rise, and
growth prospects bleak, the European Council had to show its relevance to
the people of Europe.
EC leaders are expected to agree today proposals to encourage investment and
boost confidence. The package is likely to urge governments to channel
public sector spending into capital projects and infrastructure investment.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Franc slide continues despite intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French franc continued its slide within the European exchange rate
mechanism yesterday in spite of intervention by the Bundesbank in support of
the currency.
The day's trading underlined the strains within the ERM caused by the
continued strength of the D-Mark, the result of a widespread belief that the
Bundesbank is unlikely to cut interest rates soon.
The continued flow of money into the D-Mark also put pressure on the Irish
punt and the Danish krone, the two weakest currencies in the ERM.
Speculation that the Edinburgh summit of European Community leaders might
prompt a further realignment provided another incentive for investors to buy
D-Marks.
The franc finished the day in London at FFr3.418 against the D-Mark, down
from FFr3.413 on Thursday.
Yesterday's closing price was the franc's lowest since shortly after the
European currency crisis of mid-September and within 1.2 centimes of its ERM
floor against the D-Mark of FFr3.43.
The fall came in spite of intervention by the Bundesbank on three occasions
and a statement by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, that there
was 'no need' to devalue the franc.
The Danish krone and Irish punt, which have been at the bottom of the ERM
ladder for some time, faced renewed selling, which was countered by
intervention from the Dutch and Belgian central banks.
The selling of the punt prompted Dublin again to rule out devaluation of the
currency.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Clinton names three women to top team
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PRESIDENT-ELECT Bill Clinton yesterday appointed three women to senior
positions in his administration and brought his old Oxford friend and
adviser, Mr Robert Reich, on board as labour secretary.
Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a professor at the University of California, will
be the new head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. An expert
in trade and industrial policy, she has advocated government intervention to
promote the high technology sector.
Ms Donna Shalala, the highly regarded chancellor of the University of
Wisconsin, gets the health and human services portfolio. She worked in
President Jimmy Carter's housing department, is close to Mrs Hillary Clinton
and has been attacked for being 'politically correct'.
Ms Carol Browner, who runs environmental regulation in her native Florida,
becomes the next head of the Environmental Protection Agency. She served on
the Senate staff of vice-president-elect Al Gore.
Mr Reich, though not a qualified economist, has, like Ms Tyson, been
critical of classical free-market policies.
Mr Clinton had said his government would be 'more like America' in its
racial and sexual composition. With four of his first nine senior appointees
women, he has lived up to part of that pledge, but no black, hispanic or
Asian Americans have been nominated.
The appointments are probably closer to the 'new kind of Democrat' Mr
Clinton promised to include than were the economic team, under Senator Lloyd
Bentsen of Texas as Treasury secretary, announced on Thursday.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Reich; intellectual ballast for candidate Clinton: Clinton
appointee Robert Reich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Reich, 46, a lecturer in political economy at Harvard's Kennedy
School of Government named yesterday as US labour secretary, is a lawyer by
training who has known Mr Clinton since both attended Oxford University as
Rhodes scholars in the late 1960s.
In recent weeks he has served as director of Mr Clinton's economics
transition team.
Mr Reich provided much of the intellectual firepower for Mr Clinton's
economic plan Putting People First. His latest book, The Work of Nations,
argues that the government could best promote living standards by investing
heavily in education, training and infrastructure.
Mr Reich bubbles with ideas and good humour. A frequent contributor to radio
and TV programmes, he has published a stream of books and articles in the
past decade, earning him the kind of guru status enjoyed in France by Mr
Jacques Attali, now head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
Mr Reich, however, has been criticised for changing his mind on issues: his
current view that the ownership of companies is irrelevant in a globally
integrated economy contrasts with his advocacy of traditional industrial
policies, favouring US business, in the early 1980s.
He is no stranger to Washington, having served from 1976 to 1981 as director
of policy and planning at the Federal Trade Commission.
At the Labour Department he will be able to put some of his ideas into
practice by developing new forms of skill training for the US workforce. His
nomination was welcomed by labour unions but many business groups would have
preferred a more conservative appointee.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Broking regulation boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SECURITIES and Futures Association, the self-regulatory body for
stockbrokers, has told its 1,300 members it will be co-operating more
extensively with auditors in an effort to improve the effectiveness of
regulation and cut its cost.
In a letter yesterday, Mr John Young, chief executive, said the association
was making efforts to enhance the reports it receives from the auditors of
association members.
It is proposed that the association should brief auditors on issues
including capital adequacy, new rules and regulations that are causing
difficulties.
The association hoped that auditors would provide information in exchange
and said it was discussing such ideas with the largest six accountancy
firms. The ideas have already been endorsed by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales.
Only a handful of auditors have taken advantage of the protection section
109 of the 1986 Financial Services Act to discuss issues of concern with the
association.
The letter emphasised that the exchange of information 'will be of a general
nature and not specific to individual firms. There will be no names or pack
drills.'
It added, though, that the association may hold separate meetings with firms
and their auditors, with their agreement, to discuss 'specific compliance
issues'.

<TEXT>
NATIONWIDE is the first building society to have its short-term debt rating
lowered. Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, yesterday downgraded
Nationwide's commercial paper and certificates of deposit from A1 to A2.
S&amp;P said the downgrade reflected the 'impact of the continued weakness of
the UK housing market on Nationwide's asset quality'.
Mr Richard Lassen, Nationwide treasurer, said the society would 'probably
stay away from the commercial paper market for the next few months' to avoid
higher costs. He added: 'We can continue funding in the UK, principally by
winding down our very high level of liquidity.'
Nationwide has a Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.28bn) commercial paper programme.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Tyson; cautious activist who advocates hardball: Michael
Prowse on Clinton appointees Laura D'Andrea Tyson and Robert Reich
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS Laura D'Andrea Tyson, 45, a professor of economics and business at the
University of California at Berkeley, is the first woman to be nominated
head of the Council of Economic Advisers since the presidential advisory
body was established in 1946.
Educated at Smith College, she has a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. She has written extensively on trade and industrial policy, and
on the economies of eastern Europe. Her most recent book, Who's Bashing
Whom: Trade Conflict in High Technology Industries, was published last month
by the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Within the economics profession, she has gained a reputation as one of most
intelligent critics of the free market economic policies in vogue during the
Reagan-Bush years. She describes herself as a 'cautious activist' and
believes the federal government should intervene more aggressively than in
the past to improve the performance of particular sectors.
In her latest book, she calls for targeted subsidies for strategic, high
valued added industries such as semiconductors and supercomputers, heavy
federal investment in civilian research and development, and generous tax
incentives for corporate research and development.
On trade policy she believes the US should play hardball, demanding
concessions from other countries when it opens markets. She says it should
respond to foreign subsidies with 'countervailing subsidies' for US
companies.
Ms Tyson believes the federal government should develop 'an institutional
capability for assessing competitive trends in high technology industries.'
She was one of the few academics willing to defend the 1986 semiconductor
trade deal between the US and Japan, which guaranteed foreign companies a
fixed share of the Japanese market. Many economists believe such 'managed
trade' agreements are a form of covert protection.

<TEXT>
Consumer prices in the US rose a slim 0.2 per cent in November as steady
food prices and a moderating trend restrained a sharp jump in energy prices,
Reuter reports from Washington.
The Labour Department said yesterday the rise in the consumer price index
followed an unexpectedly high 0.4 per cent gain in October.
Meanwhile retail sales rose modestly last month as the holiday sales season
opened, the Commerce Department said. A 0.4 per cent gain in November
followed a sharply revised 1.9 per cent jump in October sales - the
strongest monthly increase since a 2.3 per cent rise in January. Previously,
the department said October sales were up 0.9 per cent.

FT  12 DEC 92 / Bid to reshape security council
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS, UN Correspondent and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, OTTAWA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations general assembly yesterday made its first formal move to
expand membership of the security council, where Germany and Japan among
others are seeking permanent seats.
In a decision adopted without voting, the assembly called for written
comments by states on a 'possible review' of security council membership and
further discussions at the 1993 session.
The resolution, introduced by India - which also believes it should have a
permanent seat - referred to the council's 'increasingly crucial role' in
the world and a need to revitalise and restructure UN organs.
The 15-nation council's exceptionally busy schedule over the past 2-3 years,
with meetings now being held every few days, has left the 179-member general
assembly in a political and diplomatic backwater.
The decision is a shot across the bows of such entrenched members as Britain
and France, whose global influence has waned since the UN was set up in
1945.
Many UN delegates believe that substantial restructuring now is inevitable,
despite coolness from London and Paris.
Japan, Brazil, Egypt, Indonesia and Mexico, all claimants to a permanent
seat, were among the resolution's sponsors.
Under the UN charter, the US, Russia, Britain, France and China are
permanent members of the security council, with veto powers. But the veto
right has become somewhat academic since none of them has exercised the
prerogative for more than two years.
Canada is to withdraw its peacekeeping force from Cyprus after 28 years
because of commitments elsewhere and the lack of progress in Greek-Turkish
negotiations, Reuter reports from Ottawa.
Ms Mary Collins, junior defence minister, told parliament the Canadian
contingent of 575 troops stationed in the critical Nicosia sector would
start leaving next June.
The withdrawal would be completed by September. British, Danish and Austrian
troops would continue the UN peacekeeping mission in Cyprus.
Canada told the UN in September that its patience and resources were running
short.

THE travel and tourism industry is expected to contribute Dollars 3,500bn to
the world economy in 1993 - a 20 per cent increase on its Dollars 2,900bn
contribution in 1990, according to Wharton Econometric Forecasting in a
study commissioned by the World Travel and Tourism Council.*
The study predicts that the industry will account for 127m jobs worldwide by
next year. It will attract Dollars 422bn in investment (6.7 per cent of the
expected world total) and will account for Dollars 2,000bn in consumer
spending. The study warns of increasing congestion in the air, and the
emergence of ecotourism and rural tourism as new growth areas.

BRITAIN will press for 'generally lower' interest rates at the European

Rejecting Labour charges that Britain had failed to use its presidency of
the EC to lead a concerted drive to reduce unemployment he stressed that a
package of measures designed to get the European economy moving again would
be under discussion.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, claimed that the government had
relegated consideration of the measures needed to deal with unemployment
from a formal session at the summit to an open-ended discussion over lunch.
He called on the chancellor to demonstrate that he had the political will to
ensure that Britain took the lead at Edinburgh in initiating action to get
unemployment down.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE way or another, President Bill Clinton was going to have to deal with Mr
Lloyd Bentsen in order to get his economic programme through Congress. He
has chosen to do it with the senator from Texas on board his administration
as Treasury secretary rather than offshore as chairman of the Senate finance
committee.
Though generally described as middle-of-the-road, or, by Democratic party
standards, conservative, Mr Bentsen is not associated with any pronounced
economic philosophy. A lawyer by training, his reputation in Congress is
built mostly on an ability to compromise, detailed knowledge of the budget
and the tax code, and an inclination to favour business interests.
He is known to believe that the US does not save enough and favours a big
extension of personal pensions as one way to tackle this problem. His
business connections make him more inclined to promote economic growth than
to sit hard on inflation, which, broadly, is Mr Clinton's conviction. He
has, however, been sceptical about some aspects of health care reform, which
is high on the incoming president's agenda and important in bringing the
budget deficit under control.
Mr Bentsen's international experience is limited, much as was Mr James
Baker's when he took over the Treasury in President Ronald Reagan's second
term. In the mid-1980s, Mr Bentsen was in favour of a managed depreciation
of the dollar, but that was at a time when the US currency was under great
pressure, and he is a supporter of the North American Free Trade Agreement.
Beyond that, he has had little to say about the debt problem, assistance to
the former Soviet Union and co-ordinated international growth strategy and
is not well known by the senior bureaucrats of the International Monetary
Fund and World Bank in Washington.
But Mr Clinton has named him principally to get things done domestically. On
that Mr Bentsen has a proven track record.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Rubin: markets will be reassured
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT RUBIN is one of the most eminent members of the Democratic party
on strongly Republican Wall Street and his appointment to head the new White
House economic security council should help to reassure US financial markets
over Clinton administration policies.
Co-chairman of Goldman Sachs since 1990, Mr Rubin presides over one of the
largest and most consistently successful American investment banks.
A lawyer by training, his 26-year career at Goldman has given him an
intimate knowledge of most aspects of the capital markets.
Aged 54, but with the appearance of someone much younger, Mr Rubin has a
quietly-spoken, cerebral and rather self-effacing manner.
These qualities, coupled with his lack of experience of Washington politics,
may have ruled him out of contention for the high-profile post of Treasury
secretary.
However, he has a reputation as a thoughtful strategist and effective team
leader.
He is likely to apply Goldman's strong collegiate culture to the delicate
task of consensus-building among the many economic voices clamouring for Mr
Clinton's attention.
In an interview with the Financial Times last summer, he described himself
as 'very pragmatic' on most economic policy issues and a centrist on social
affairs.
He believes that one of the most critical domestic issues facing the US is
to 'break the cycle of poverty and disaffection' in the nation's urban
ghettoes.
A lifelong Democrat, and the grandson of a party leader in New York City's
Brooklyn borough, the wealthy Mr Rubin has long been a significant financial
contributor to Democratic candidates and causes.
He pinned his colours to Mr Clinton's mast last year, long before the
governor seemed a serious presidential contender.
He played an important behind-the-scenes role in ensuring the success of the
Democratic party convention in New York which nominated Mr Clinton last
July.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Panetta will speak for the deficit-sensitive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LEON PANETTA has spent much of the past 15 years developing his
credentials as one of Congress's most know-ledgeable, intense and
intellectually curious experts on the US budget process.
As chairman of the House of Representatives budget committee for the past
four years, the California congressman was one of the Democrats' leaders in
budget summits with the Republican administration.
With the White House and Congress now about to come under the control of the
same party, there will be little need for budget summits. His Republican
admirers are not surprised, therefore, that he is taking the opportunity to
move to the executive branch as director of the Office of Management and
Budget.
Mr Panetta was originally a Republican himself, but he changed party shortly
after being fired by President Richard Nixon as head of the Office of Civil
Rights because of his complaints about how slowly the administration was
approaching desegregation.
First elected to Congress in 1976 from a district centred on Monterey, he is
now in his second stint on the budget committee where, unlike other House
committees, members serve only six years at a time.
He has long been a spokesman for deficit-sensitive Democrats, carrying the
lesson he learned from his father - an immigrant from Italy who always paid
cash - who 'kicked the hell' out of his 18-year-old son when he found he had
secretly acquired a credit card.
'He's a workhorse, and not a show-horse. He's not the kind of guy who sits
around and kisses babies or clips ribbons,' comments one friend. Taking an
administration job may allow Mr Panetta to acquire a Washington home of his
own. He now shares a two-bedroom house with three other Democratic
congressmen.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Altman called in from banking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NO ONE is more practised than Roger Altman, the Blackstone Group partner
named Senator Bentsen's deputy at the Treasury, at bridging the gap between
the chintzy elegance of New York investment banking boutiques, and the
stately portals of Capitol Hill.
For most of his professional life, the tall, softly spoken banker who
advised the Clinton campaign, has glided between politics and money. As a
student, Mr Altman was a Clinton contemporary at Georgetown University,
before going to University of Chicago, to acquire the requisite MBA.
Despite having worked on Robert Kennedy's presidential campaign, banking
proved his first call. In 1969, he joined Lehman Brothers, the Wall Street
investment firm, rising to partner five years later. In 1977, the arrival of
the Carter administration took him back to Washington, as assistant
secretary at the Treasury, with responsibility for domestic finance. That,
in turn, gave the New Englander a role in two of the late-1970s most
dramatic financial restructurings - New York City and Chrysler.
With the Carter administration's end, Mr Altman headed back to Lehman,
before joining his former boss, Pete Petersen, as a Blackstone partner.
His specific role at the investment banking firm has been international
co-ordination, and Blackstone has duly forged links with Nikko Securities in
Japan, Hambro Magan in the UK, Banque Indosuez in France and Germany's Sal
Oppenheim.
Meanwhile, Mr Altman has kept his economic views very much in the public
domain. An assiduous contributor to newspapers columns, he was arguing in
autumn 1990, for example, that the US economy was almost certainly in
recession. His prescription was a sharp lowering of interest rates, despite
inflationary worries then stemming from the Gulf conflict.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Rivlin hawkish on budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIST and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, Alice M Rivlin,
61, has been nominated as deputy budget director. She is best known in
Washington as the founding director of the congressional budget office,
established in 1975 to provide independent advice on budgetary matters for
Congress.
In the late 1960s she was an assistant secretary at the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare, and helped implement Lyndon Johnson's Great
Society programmes.
Ms Rivlin is a past president of the American Economics Association and a
past director of economic studies at Brookings, Washington's premier liberal
think-tank. She is a director of several US companies.
She has written extensively on the US economy, budget policy and many social
issues including health care.
Physically diminutive, she has a pithy speaking style and gained a
reputation for independence as CBO director. Her realistic forecasts often
infuriated both White House and congressional committees.
In her latest book, Reviving the American Dream, she argues for a radical
rethinking of the roles and financing of federal and state government. She
believes states should assume full responsibility for a 'productivity
agenda', which would include education, skill training, infrastructure and
other policies to improve national competitiveness. As a quid pro quo,
federal government would assume responsibility for health care.
On the budget policy, she is as hawkish as her boss, Mr Leon Panetta. She
has argued strongly for tough action to reduce the deficit.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Clinton brings in the economic heavyweights: Talented
line-up will attack budget deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GETTING legislation through Congress and reassuring Wall Street appear to
have been President-elect Bill Clinton's dominant concerns in assembling a
talented and remarkably conservative economic team.
As expected, the two top jobs go to Democratic congressional heavyweights,
Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Mr Leon Panetta, a congressman from
California, who were named treasury secretary and budget director. As former
chairmen of the Senate finance committee and the House budget committee
respectively, they appear ideally suited to shepherd sensitive economic and
social legislation through Congress.
Wall Street is strongly represented, with Mr Robert Rubin, a co-chairman of
Goldman Sachs, becoming special assistant to the president for economic
policy, and Mr Roger Altman, an investment banker at the Blackstone Group,
named as Mr Bentsen's deputy at the Treasury.
The only professional economist in the team announced yesterday was Ms Alice
Rivlin, a fellow at the Brookings Institution and a former director of the
Congressional Budget Office, who will serve as deputy to Mr Panetta at the
Office of Management and Budget.
The biggest surprise was that Mr Clinton did not name the chairman of the
Council of Economic Advisers in his first batch of appointments. In previous
administrations, the CEA chairman has served as part of a 'troika' of
advisers to the president, alongside the treasury secretary and budget
director.
But Mr Clinton said he intended the CEA to have 'more of an influence in
terms of ideas' than in the past. He also wanted to elevate the role in
economic policy-making of other departments, such as energy and commerce.
Speculation about CEA chair yesterday centred on Ms Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an
industrial and trade policy expert at the University of California at
Berkeley, and Mr Lawrence Summers, chief economist at the World Bank, who is
opposed by some environmentalists because of an insensitive memo he wrote at
the bank.
However, Mr Clinton's mention of the importance of ideas could indicate that
his old friend Mr Robert Reich, who heads the economic transition team, is
still in the running.
The biggest innovation was the appointment of Mr Rubin to head a new
economic council within the White House. This is intended to play a role
analogous to that of the National Security Council and represents an attempt
to bring economic policy to the same level of prominence within the White
House as foreign affairs and defence - all topics which have tended to
preoccupy past presidents.
Mr Clinton will chair the economic council, whose members will include
relevant cabinet officers, such as the commerce secretary, as well as the
other members of the economic team named yesterday. Some academics, however,
fear that the new council could overshadow the CEA.
Mr Rubin regards his main task as co-ordinating economic policy. Mr Clinton
yesterday compared his role to that of General Brent Scowcroft, President
George Bush's national security adviser, and played down the possibility of
any conflict between Mr Rubin and Mr Bentsen, making it clear that the
treasury secretary would be the administration's senior spokesman on
economics after the president.
The team boasts a wealth of experience and a long institutional memory. Mr
Bentsen and Mr Panetta have played leading roles for over a decade in
framing congressional economic and budget policies. Ms Rivlin is remembered
as a highly competent and fiercely independent director of the CBO from 1975
to 1983.
Mr Altman served in the Treasury during the Carter administration. Mr Rubin
has all-round financial expertise as co-chairman of one Wall Street's most
successful investment banks.
Mr Bentsen's widely trailed appointment as treasury secretary was welcomed
in US business and financial circles. If he and Mr Panetta have a weakness,
it is lack of experience in international economic policy-making. However,
the Wall Street appointees are both knowledgeable about foreign economies
and financial markets.
The overall composition of the team suggests considerable stress will be
laid on measures to improve the economy's long-term competitiveness. All
members of the team are known to regard budget deficit reduction as a
priority. The OMB duo of Mr Panetta and Ms Rivlin is likely to prove
especially hawkish on fiscal policy.
Mr Clinton was at pains yesterday to emphasise two points: he remains the
administration's chief economic decision maker, the 'ultimate arbiter' of
policy; and he puts a premium on co-operative teamwork - something obviously
lacking in the Bush administration.
He appeared justifiably pleased with his handiwork: on paper at least, he is
fielding the strongest economic team of any recent president, one which is
likely to gain the respect of Republicans as well as Democrats.

OFFICIALS from about 30 countries were last night due to finish two days'
talks on a multilateral steel agreement, the first negotiating meeting since
negotiations broke up without a deal last March, writes Frances Williams in
Geneva.
Countries are expected to agree further meetings in a bid to finalise a deal
by next February, when the Uruguay Round of global trade talks is due to be
concluded. But the US and EC remain far apart on how to treat steel
subsidies and dumping in the proposed accord. The EC insists a deal must
address the present spate of US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits, while
the US argues the MSA should apply only to future actions.
If agreed, the MSA would phase out steel tariffs over 10 years, scrap
non-tariff barriers and outlaw direct state subsidies for steel production.
But disagreements exist over how far indirect subsidies, and curbs on US
recourse to anti-dumping and subsidy action, should be allowed.

FT  11 DEC 92 / The Edinburgh Summit: Delors calls for unity; keeps quiet on
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EDINBURGH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DELIVERING a traditional pre-summit appeal for European unity, Mr Jacques
Delors, the EC Commission president, yesterday made an important tactical
decision. He did not mention the word 'Maastricht'.
Mr Delors, who was awarded an honorary degree yesterday by Edinburgh
University, used his acceptance address to call for an 'organised and
caring' Community which would be more than merely a free trade area.
Dressed in a red gown and looking less like a would-be Emperor of Europe
than a slightly abashed Meistersinger, Mr Delors admitted the EC was going
through a period of doom and gloom. He urged the Community to look beyond
its ups and downs and create unity in diversity.
Although he praised the single European market taking effect next year, he
avoided referring to the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Delors may have reflected that the treaty is hardly more popular in
Scotland than in the rest of the UK. An opinion poll in The Scotsman
yesterday showed 33 per cent of Scottish voters against, 29 per cent in
favour, and the rest undecided.
The degree ceremony, in the splendour of the university's McEwan Hall, was
twice interrupted by young protesters in the gallery shouting - with
distinctly Sassanach voices - 'It's your slump - We won't pay.' They were
hustled out by stewards as guests tried to drown the shouts with applause.
Mr Delors said part of the programme for the single market launched in 1985
had already become reality. 'The brushes could do with a little bit of spit
and polish, but the single market will be open for business on New Year's
Day,' he said.
At a reception afterwards, Mr Delors said the summit would probably not
reach agreement on where to site the proposed EC central bank - part of a
complex bargaining process also involving decisions on sites for other
Community institutions.
Britain's bid to bring the central bank to London was unrealistic, he said.
He pointed out that London was already the venue for the European bank for
Reconstruction and Development, and that the UK was not currently in the
exchange rate mechanism.

MR STEPHEN Friedman, co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, will become sole head of
the New York investment bank when Mr Robert Rubin, the firm's other joint
chief, becomes director of the Clinton administration's new National
Economic Council.
Goldman Sachs made clear last night that Mr Rubin's appointment, announced
by president-elect Bill Clinton yesterday, would mean no other changes in
the top management of the company.
Goldman's strategy has made the firm one of the most consistently successful
on Wall Street.
In a message to staff yesterday Mr Friedman said: 'Apart from normal
evolution, you should not expect any departures from the managerial or
strategic courses we have been on.'
The Clinton appointment brings to an end an unusually close working
relationship between Mr Rubin and Mr Friedman for much of their careers at
Goldman. They were appointed co-chief operating officers in 1987 and
co-chairmen in 1990.
Mr Rubin will detatch himself completely from the firm.

<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission has brought insider trading
charges against Mr Jonathan Sheinberg, the son of Mr Sidney Sheinberg,
president of MCA, the Hollywood studio acquired in 1990 by Matsushita of
Japan.
According to the SEC charges, which were filed in a lawsuit in a Los Angeles
federal court and settled simultaneously by agreement with the younger Mr
Sheinberg, the 34-year-old son of the MCA chief overheard his father
discussing the Dollars 6.1bn Matsushita takeover on the telephone. He then
shared that information with others even though his father stressed that he
must keep it confidential and not trade in MCA stock.
The SEC alleged that Mr Sheinberg shared the inside information with his
father-in-law, a close friend of his former wife and his business manager,
each of whom then purchased MCA securities on September 24 1990, based on
the information. Matsushita's takeover of MCA was formally announced in
November 1990.
Mr Sheinberg and his friends all agreed yesterday - without admitting or
denying the allegations made by the SEC - to pay a total of more than
Dollars 1.3m, an amount equal to the alleged profits made plus interest and
penalties.
The Matsushita takeover of MCA was the largest Japanese acquisition of a US
company when it was unveiled. MCA owns Universal Pictures, plus record
labels and a cluster of publishing, theme park and property assets.

FT  11 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further fall as base rate hopes
recede
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate optimism was firmly discouraged yesterday both by the
Bundesbank and by the UK chancellor of the exchequer. The setback in the UK
stock market deepened in the face of a fresh sell-off in stock index
futures.
A fall of 24.2 points took the FT-SE Index down to 2,726.5, virtually the
day's low and around 2.3 per cent below the peak achieved only ten days ago.
Yesterday's setback ranged across the full range of the market, bringing a
fall of 6.9 in the FT-SE Mid 250 Index.
Share prices tried to rally from a dull start but soon turned back again as
first reports reached London from the Bundesbank's press conference;
unchanged German rates, plus a warning from the Bundesbank president that
there was no room for a rate cut at present, undermined lingering hopes for
a reduction in UK base rates before the year-end.
Worse was to come, however, when Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, ruled out any early cut in base rates, although, reviewing the
first of the Treasury's monthly monetary reports, he saw encouraging signs
for the domestic economy.
The premium on the December contract on the Footsie melted away, leaving the
contract in line with the cash market at the official close. With the
two-week equity trading account due to close tonight, professional traders
were looking for ways to take their profits. In addition, there were many
large 'bed and breakfast' tax-related deals.
Seaq-reported trading volume, swollen by the tax-related business and by a
trading programme towards the close, totalled 711.7m shares compared with
660.5m on Wednesday. Retail, or customer business in equities, was worth
Pounds 1.28bn on Wednesday but traders believe that equity volume is being
swollen significantly at present by the year-end tax-related deals.
While few strategists had remained convinced that a further base rate cut
would come this year, yesterday's discouraging news from Germany and the UK
took some of the speculative steam out of the equity market. The stock
market has risen by around 16 per cent on the Footsie scale since Britain
quit the ERM in mid-September and a pause for consolidation has been
expected.
Corporate developments also remained bleak yesterday, with Guinness, the
international drinks group, again hit as City analysts digested the outcome
of the meetings with the board arranged this week.
The renewed weakness in sterling, mirrored yesterday by half point losses in
UK government bonds, prompted some strategists to take a more cautious line.
Mr Peter Lyon at Smith New Court, the London securities trading house,
commented that, while the market's underlying uptrend is still in place, the
risks of a correction have strengthened. At UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, Mr Mark
Brown repeated the widespread concern that UK institutions will be obliged
to commit more cash flow to government bonds next year and could therefore
be net sellers of equities.
However, selling pressure in equities was not heavy enough to cause concern.
After allowing for the end-year technical activity, traders believe that the
institutions are still positive towards the UK stock market and are doing
little more than make minor adjustments to portfolios ahead of 1992.

FT  11 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness pressure continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fall-out from Guinness's round of meetings with analysts on Wednesday
continued, a series of downgrades sending the shares once again into
retreat. The meetings followed purported remarks by the company's chief
executive and chairman-elect that trading conditions would be tougher in
1993 than in 1992.
The meetings, which continued yesterday, clarified Guinness's trading
situation and led analysts to cut profit forecasts. Most pulled their
figures back by between 6-10 per cent to around Pounds 920m for this year.
But such is the pessimism regarding earnings growth for the following 12
months that the new 1994 forecasts are not substantially above 1993.
Guinness was said to have pinpointed the problems as chiefly in the Spanish
beer market, LVMH, the French luxury products maker in which Guinness has a
cross holding, and a higher interest charge caused by sterling's
devaluation. After falling 23 on Wednesday, the shares tumbled a further 24
yesterday, closing at 478p. However, some analysts feel they sill have
further to go. Mr David Thompson at Kleinwort Benson argued that the shares
should be sold down to 450p, and that they will probably fall further still
in the short-term.
Tarmac alert
A sudden burst of activity in shares of Tarmac, the building
materials/housebuilding group, revived takeover stories, with market rumours
suggesting that BTR, the conglomerate, could be about to launch a bid for
the troubled building company.
Turnover was boosted by the second half of a bed and breakfast, or
tax-related, deal in the stock which accounted for some 4.4m shares in early
trade. But heavy demand during the afternoon saw overall turnover in the
stock spiral to 15m shares, the heaviest single day's business since
mid-September. Tarmac shares settled a net 4 higher at 99p.
Tarmac has been the subject of many takeover stories this year. An offer
from Minorco, part of Mr Harry Oppenheimer's worldwide mining empire, was
said to have been rebuffed by the UK group. BTR settled a penny harder at
512p on turnover of 3.7m.
TSB sell-off
A substantial profits downgrade by Smith New Court was behind the marked
weakness of TSB shares which, after a steady performance for much of the
morning, suddenly came under pressure prior to closing a busy session a net
4 off at 139p. Turnover in the stock expanded sharply during the afternoon,
eventually reaching 4.7m shares.
Smith New Court's banks analyst Mr Michael Lever chopped his current year
profits expectation, already one of the lowest in the market, by half, down
from a previous Pounds 125m to Pounds 62m.
Mr Lever blamed the steep reduction on the ongoing problems at Hill Samuel,
the merchant bank bought by TSB in the late-1980's. He said worries about
Hill Samuel's Mortgage Express division had been prompted by the recent
warning on the mortgage business issued by Abbey National. 'Mortgage Express
needs more provisioning,' said Mr Lever.
Store group hit
A critical note from US-owned broker Goldman Sachs helped hurt Marks and
Spencer in a weak stores sector. The shares retreated 9 to 319p. Analyst Mr
Paul Deacon argues that the food and stores group will suffer on two fronts,
namely from the rapid expansion of the big food retailers and from its low
retail recovery potential. Both issues point to several years'
underperformance from the shares.
Renewed fears of a price war in the perfume market hit Boots following
reports that the high street retailer and chemist had reduced prices of some
brands by 25 per cent. However, analysts played down the concerns arguing
that the effect on Boots would only be in the region of 1 per cent of
profits. The shares, which have had a good run, fell 8 to 519p.
Results from Great Universal Stores, although in line with expectations,
proved worrying in parts to some in the market and the shares were marked
back. Most criticism was voiced over the low margin growth in the mail order
business. The shares fell 35 to 1618p. SG Warburg was said to have been
advising clients to take profits.
Sears slipped 2 to 97p. Kleinwort Benson changed from a buy to a hold on the
stock which it considers to have overrun.
Initial strength in conglomerate Lonrho gave way to heavy selling, leaving
the shares to close 4 lighter at 75p, 10p below the 3-for-10 rights issue
price of 85p, as market watchers predicted that take-up of the issue was
likely to be very low. Turnover had reached 6m by the close.
The shares moved 4 ahead to 83p in early trading but closer examination of
the offer details led to a turnaround in sentiment.
The two-way pull in BP continued yesterday with the shares again the most
active on the London market with turnover approaching the 22m-mark. At the
close the shares were marginally easier at 221 1/2 p as domestic sellers
achieved ascendancy over US buyers.
Shell, meanwhile, eased to 548p on good turnover of 7.7m, despite reported
switching from BP. There was no let up in the selling pressure on Lasmo. The
latter dropped a further 8 to 143p despite a well-received presentation in
the US. Enterprise also suffered, falling 10 to 434p. Premier Consolidated,
on the other hand, touched 19p prior to closing a net penny ahead at 18 1/2
p after more encouraging drilling news from its operations off the coast of
Burma.
The maintained interim dividend announced by Pilkington, the glass
specialist, took the market by surprise and saw the shares run up to 89p
before settling a net 3 higher at 87p. Turnover reached 16m shares with
dealers reporting takeover speculation.
The stunning performance of computer software group Tadpole Technology since
the debut on Monday continued another burst of buying, driving the shares up
8 to 143p.
Coach operator National Express made an impressive debut on the market. The
offer and sale of nearly 28m shares at 165p was said to have been
oversubscribed and the shares closed 6 higher at 171p.
Turnover in Anglo-French paper group Arjo Wiggins Appleton rose to 13m,
after UBS Phillips &amp; drew, the company's broker, downgraded current and
following year profit expectations.
The shares fell 6 to 145p, after UBS reduced its profits estimate for this
year by Pounds 25m to Pounds 160m, and cut the following year's figure by
Pounds 32m to Pounds 158m.
BZW prompted a burst of strength in Lloyds Bank shares by lifting their
current year profits forecast from Pounds 665m to Pounds 700m. 'We think
provisions will be marginally lower than we previously expected,' said Mr
Julian Robins, banks specialist at BZW. The change helped drive Lloyds
shares up 5 to 502p on good turnover of 3.2m.
HSBC tumbled 15 more to 471p, with dealers wary of further big falls on the
Hong Kong market. Standard Chartered shares were sustained by their
impending entry to the prestigious Footsie-100 and settled only a fraction
off at 534p. Hambros Bank retreated very late in the session, slipping 11 to
219p as the market reacted nervously to suggestions that a verdict in the
long-running dispute between the merchant bank and the state of the late
Norwegian shipping magnate Mr Hilmar Reksten will be made next month.
The continued decline in Guinness again undermined Allied Lyons, the stock
off 11 at 617p. However, Grand Metropolitan bounced back on hopes that the
US recovery would lift trading. The shares rose 7 to 430p.
Disappointment at presentations held by Cadbury-Schweppes and United
Biscuits was said to have knocked both stocks. The former retreated 9 to
456p and the latter 10 to 337p.
The disposal of the loss-making Sliks swimwear division and concentration on
the lingerie business was behind the strong performance of Celestion shares,
up 10 to 77p.

FT  11 DEC 92 / London Stock Exchange: Futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISAPPOINTMENT that there would be no cut in UK or German interest rates led
to heavy selling in stock index futures, writes Joel Kibazo.
The first trade in the December contract on the FT-SE was struck at 2,761
and good buying, particularly from independent traders, saw the contract
rise to 2,768 within the first hour of business. This proved to be the
session's high, for a period of light profit-taking followed, sending
December gently lower.
The announcement of unchanged interest rates from the Bundesbank over the
lunchtime period led to a heavy bout of selling, which saw the contract fall
to 2,755, and pulled the cash market lower.
The poor opening on Wall Street led to a further selling as did comments
from the UK chancellor of the excheqeur that there would be no early cuts in
interest rates.
December closed at 2,730, down 33 on the previous session and just ahead of
its fair value premium to cash of around 4. Turnover at 11,271 contracts was
particularly heavy. Traders attributed the high volume to increased rolling
of positions in to the March contract. It saw business of around 5,000 lots,
up from 1,834 on Tuesday.
The volume in traded options also saw an improvement on Tuesday's poor
level. It reached 26,294 lots, with the the FT-SE 100 option trading 13,402
contracts.

FT  11 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines despite good
economic data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
PROFIT-TAKING weighed on US share prices despite more good news on inflation
and jobs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 11.62 at 3,312.19,
but off its lows for the day when the index had been down more than 20
points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended 0.99 lower at
434.66, the Amex composite down 0.59 at 392.39 and the Nasdaq composite off
4.99 at 658.93. Turnover on the NYSE was 242m shares, and declines
outdistanced rises by 1,043 to 775.
Signs that the market's recent rally may be running out of steam were
evident when prices failed to rise after the Labor Department reported that
producer prices fell 0.2 per cent in November, following a 0.1 per cent
decline the previous month, and that weekly jobless claims in late November
fell by 38,000.
Both sets of data were better than analysts had expected. The producer
prices figure was particularly encouraging, as it confirmed that
inflationary pressures are not building up despite evidence that the
recovery is gathering pace.
The market failed to respond positively to the data, primarily because the
initial rush of investor demand that has powered several indices to new
highs over the past few weeks is clearly waning.
General Motors eased Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 33 3/8 on the news that the car
manufacturer faces a law suit filed on behalf of some purchasers of pick-up
trucks with fuel tanks located outside the frame. Other motor stocks were
also weaker, with Chrysler Dollars  3/4 lower at Dollars 32 1/4 and Ford
down Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 42 3/4 .
Equitable rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 13 3/4 in turnover of 1.8m shares on
news that the company had formed a strategic partnership with Unum, the
specialist Maine-based insurer, to sell Unum-designed individual disability
insurance products. Unum firmed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 53 3/4 .
Chock Full O' Nuts rose Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 8 1/4 after reporting fiscal
first quarter net income of 12 cents a share, up from 5 cents a share a year
earlier. The company also said it expected profits for the full year 1993 to
come in above analysts' forecasts of 45 cents a share.
Delta Air Lines firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 51 1/2 after the company said
that contrary to reports, it was not currently considering suspending its
quarterly dividend or planning job layoffs. On the Nasdaq market, Microsoft
fell Dollars 3 to Dollars 89 in volume of 2.8m shares on a downgrade from
Donaldson Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, which believes that the company will not exceed
analysts' earnings expectations. Hopes that the company would do just that
have been behind the recent surge in Microsoft shares.
Canada
TORONTO stocks partly recouped earlier losses, but still finished nearly 0.5
per cent lower after a heavy trading session. The TSE-300 fell 15.3 to
3,270.2 on volume of 44.7m shares valued at CDollars 351m. Declines outpaced
advances, 335 to 275, with 304 issues unchanged.

FT  11 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Gains in New York help
Nikkei rise for third day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of an early US economic recovery, a rise on Wall Street, and the
expected passage of the supplementary budget pushed the Nikkei average up in
active trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average rose 95.08 to 17,501.30, extending its winning streak
to the third consecutive day. The index opened at the day's low of 17,466.80
and rose to a high of 17,704.71 in the afternoon on buying by public funds
and foreign investors, and on short-covering. Towards the end of the
session, however, future-related selling cut some of the earlier gains.
Volume rose to 370m shares from 240m, the highest since October 9 when 484m
shares changed hands. Advances led declines by 781 to 238 with 122 issues
remaining unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks rose 15.91
to 1,328.83 and in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 7.99 to 1,080.13.
Expectations that share prices will gain ground on today's fixing of the
'special quotation' or settlement price for futures and options prompted
buying by investors and short-covering by dealers.
Market participants hope the index will break through the 200-day moving
average of 17,563, an important resistance level. The Nikkei has not closed
above the 200-day average for 13 months.
Speculation that Mr Yoshiro Mori, chairman of the Liberal Democratic Party's
policy research council, may become the next finance minister after the
cabinet reshuffle, expected today, added to positive sentiment. Traders said
that since Mr Mori is seen as a leading figure in pushing the government to
adopt last August's emergency economic package, he might implement new
measures to help the market.
Active short-covering helped financial issues, with Industrial Bank of Japan
up Y100 to Y2,570, Sumitomo Bank gaining Y50 to Y1,830 and Nomura Securities
Y50 to Y1,520.
Profit-taking depressed some large-capital blue chips. Nippon Steel, the
most active issue of the day, fell Y3 to Y295.
High-technology blue chips gained ground on hopes of firm semiconductor
demand in the US. Toshiba gained Y10 to Y633 and Fujitsu rose Y22 to Y578.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 261.82 to 19,116.33 in volume of 36.2m
shares. The index rose above the 19,000 level for the first time since
October 16.
Roundup
HONG KONG lost some of the gains it had made earlier in the week while
Australia closed at a three-month high. Bombay, which opened for one hour's
trading, fell 4 per cent.
HONG KONG fell back in late trading after the Sino-British Joint Liaison
Group failed to produce a communique at the end of its meeting. The Hang
Seng index lost 65.46 or 1.2 per cent to 5,273.79 in thin turnover of
HKDollars 2.2bn.
Commentators noted that it was the first time in 25 meetings that the group
had not issued a statement and this added to fears of a breakdown in
co-operation between the two sides.
Property stocks were among the day's biggest losers with Cheung Kong down 20
cents to HKDollars 18.30 and Sun Hung Kai Properties shedding 60 cents to
HKDollars 26.30.
AUSTRALIA ignored bad unemployment data and was lifted by strong overseas
buying and continued interest in BHP, which rose 20 cents to ADollars 12.62.
The All Ordinaries index rose 19.1 to 1,501.3 in turnover of ADollars
352.7m. Banks were positive, with Westpac adding 2 cents to ADollars 3.07
and National Australia up 8 cents at ADollars 7.64.
BOMBAY, closed for three days following the violence throughout the country,
saw the BSE index fall 107.79 to 2,589.11 in thin turnover.
SINGAPORE eased with the Straits Times industrial index falling 4.36 to
1,442.38. Among actives, Inchcape fell 30 cents to SDollars 6.20.
SEOUL was encouraged by rumours of a cut in interest rates and the composite
index rose 21.29 to 642.03 in turnover of Won383.25bn.
TAIWAN reversed early gains to finish lower on profit-taking. The weighted
index finished 29.80 lower at 3,746.75 in turnover of TDollars 10bn.
MANILA fell for the second day as foreign investors unloaded their positions
in Philippine National Bank. The composite index lost 16.99 to 1,248.84 in
turnover of 244m pesos. PNB lost 12 pesos to 199 pesos.

FT  11 DEC 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses upset by Bundesbank's
stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank's decision not to cut interest rates upset continental share
prices in the afternoon, but Scandinavian markets were cheered by the
effective devaluation of the Norwegian crown, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT traded quietly ahead of the Bundesbank's statement which came
after the official close. The DAX index closed down 6.11 at 1,494.48 but
after hours in London, the German component of the FT-SE Eurotrack fell 1.3
per cent. Turnover rose to DM4.2bn from DM4bn.
Analysts were not surprised by the Bundesbank's stance, taking the view that
rates were likely to ease next year when it became more apparent that
Germany was in a recession.
Daimler, down DM3.30 at DM514.40, said that it expected to show a decline in
profits for 1992 in spite of a 40 per cent rise in sales on the year. The
company also said it was likely to lose Dollars 1.3bn after Northwest
Airlines cancelled an Airbus order this week.
Deutsche Bank lost another DM6.50 to DM641.50 following disappointing
10-month figures earlier in the week, while Commerzbank slipped DM1.10 to
DM239.00. Dresdner lost DM2.50 to DM346.50.
PARIS ended 1.2 per cent lower on disappointment about the Bundesbank's
decision, which sharply reduced the possibility of a cut in French interest
rates at a time when the economy was suffering and companies were issuing
warnings about profits and trading prospects. Dealers said that only
speculation about a devaluation in the franc would continue to keep
investors interested in French equities. The CAC-40 index fell from the
day's high of 1,806.59 to close 21.68 lower at 1,769.48 in good turnover of
FFr2.83bn.
LVMH dropped FFr175 or 4.7 per cent to FFr3,515 after Guinness, the UK
drinks group in which it has a cross-shareholding, issued a gloomy trading
forecast. BSN fell FFr18 to FFr948 in sympathy.
Saint-Gobain fell FFr12 to FFr516 after Pilkington, its UK rival in the
glass industry, reported a sharp drop in first-half pre-tax profits.
Lyonnaise des Eaux shed a further FFr6 to FFr454 in spite of news of an
Argentine contract, while Elf relapsed by FFr10.50 to FFr339.50 on US
selling.
OSLO soared 7.5 per cent in response to the government's decision to let the
Norwegian crown float free from the Ecu. The crown weakened about 5 per cent
from its central rate against the Ecu after the news. The all-share index
jumped as high as 404.56 before closing 27.97 higher at 399.38 in turnover
worth NKr710m. Industrial shares had the biggest gains on prospects of
greater competitiveness. Norsk Hydro rose NKr17.5 to NKr164, while Elkem
jumped NKr12 to NKr40.
COPENHAGEN was lifted by the Norwegian crown float and expectations of a
possible devaluation in the Danish crown. The KFX top-20 index gained 1.11
to 77.18 in turnover of DKr83m. Novo Nordisk and Sophus Berendsen gained
DKr13 and DKr2 respectively to DKr583 and DKr387. STOCKHOLM showed a more
muted reaction as the Affarsvarlden General Index added 2.9 to 901.1 as
turnover declined to SKr734m.
Trading in Astra continues to dominate the market ahead of the company's
meeting with analysts next week. The B share added SKr16 to SKr743.
MILAN was dragged down by Fiat which fell further after the previous day's
poor car sales data for November. Position-squaring ahead of the close of
the December account next week also put downward pressure on the market. The
Comit index fell 6.55 to 425.48 in turnover estimated at L145bn after
L135bn.
Fiat dropped L195 or 4.7 per cent to L3,930, which reflected its heavy fall
after hours on Tuesday.
ZURICH remained in positive territory although off earlier highs. The SMI
index closed 7.9 higher at 1,988.6.
Georg Fischer bearers fell SFr65 or 9.5 per cent to SFr620 after Wednesday's
disappointing forecast for 1992.
AMSTERDAM ignored a small cut in domestic interest rates and the CBS
Tendency index closed 0.9 weaker at 105.3. Nedlloyd lost Fl 2.20 to Fl 30.70
as the group said that it would be making fresh cash calls on the capital
market.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Norwegian bank floats krone
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY succumbed to heavy selling by currency speculators yesterday and
effectively devalued the krone. Norway's finance ministry said it was
removing the currency from its peg to the Ecu and allowing it to float,
writes Peter John.
The drama, heightened by early rumours of a coup in Russia and then replaced
by tension emanating from a prolonged Bundesbank meeting, was a further blow
to the stability of the exchange rate mechanism. The outcome of the
Bundesbank meeting, a reaffirmation of existing interest rates, buoyed the
D-Mark but ensured that the dollar failed to react to more positive economic
news from the US.
Norway's action yesterday morning prompted a sharp rise in the Norwegian
stock market but placed immediate pressure on vulnerable currencies within
the ERM, the Danish krone and the Irish punt. The French franc was also sold
and at least one dealer said the french central bank had been intervening.
The Norwegian central bank said it floated the krone as it expected pressure
on it to continue. Mr Leif Eide, the bank's director said; 'It became too
hard to fight, we saw little chance . . . of getting out of this, no matter
how much currency reserves we used.'
The krone has been allowed to swing 2.25 per cent either side of a central
rate of NKr7.9940 per Ecu. It fell steeply after the move to close in London
at Nkr4.295 against the D-Mark from NKr4.0840 previously.
Afterwards, attention returned to the ERM and especially to the Danish
currency which many now see as the prime devaluation candidate.
The Danish currency, which is approaching its ERM floor of DKr3.9012 against
the D-Mark, fell but rallied to close virtually unchanged at DKr3.8820.
The punt replaced the franc at the bottom of the ERM floor and fell to
DM2.6285 from DM2.6378. The franc drifted further towards its own limit
against the D-Mark to reach FFr3.413.
In the afternoon, there was growing tension as the Bundesbank Council
meeting was prolonged for an hour, suggesting that some serious change of
policy could be announced. The commitment to high interest rates was a
disappointment but the statement that the M3 money supply target for 1993
was to rise to between 4.5 per cent and 6.5 per cent coupled with a switch
from a variable repo rate to a fixed rate of 8.75 per cent for the next
three weeks steadied nerves.
There was further relief from action by the Dutch and Belgian central banks
who cut key interest rates, Holland by 0.25 of a percentage point and
Belgium by 10 basis points.
Sterling recovered from a low of of DM2.4419 to end the day a pfennig off at
DM2.4550 and slightly stronger against the dollar at Dollars 1.5765.
The impact of encouraging employment and producer price statistics helped
the dollar recover some earlier weakness to end up against the D-Mark at
DM1.5765 although it was weaker against the Yen at Y123.50.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Money Markets: Tussle on futures
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DETAILS of yesterday's hungrily awaited Bundesbank meeting were closely
scrutinised by the money markets but failed to provide strong signals on
future interest rates.
The 'firm rates' camp latched on to hard-line comments by Bundesbank
president Mr Helmut Schlesinger who said he saw no room for a cut. Those
pinning their hopes on a reduction gleaned comfort from the rise in the
German bank's M3 money growth range to between 4.5 and 6.5 per cent for
1993. They suggested it was an increase from a figure already artificially
boosted by heavy intervention and consequently a signal that lower rates
were on the agenda.
Short sterling's performance reflected the two opinions. The March contract,
which is often seen as the market's view on the way base rates are going,
opened at 93.47 and was bought up to 93.55 on optimism surrounding the M3
growth figure. Mere hope was not enough however and March fell back to end
the day 4 basis points off at 93.43 with nearly 20,000 contracts traded by
the official close. Following volatility last week, March has stabilised
around the 93.50 level, signalling a further base rate cut of half a
percentage point within the next few months.
The contract for December delivery, which is now driven purely by technical
factors, opened at 92.85 and closed little changed at 92.86.
Meanwhile, Bank of England operations flowed slightly more easily following
the tight money of recent days.
The central bank offered an early round of assistance after forecasting a
liquidity shortage of about Pounds 800m. Among the main factors affecting
the position were the take-up of treasury bills and paper maturing in
official hands, expected to drain Pounds 602m, bankers' balances below
target which would remove Pounds 140m, and a rise in note circulation
siphoning a further Pounds 190m.
Partly offsetting these were exchequer transactions adding Pounds 155m to
the market.
Most of the offer was taken up and the Bank provided the money market with
Pounds 559m of early assistance, buying Pounds 125m of band one bank bills
at 6 7/8 per cent and Pounds 434m of bills for resale to the market on
January 5 at 6 15/16 per cent.
The Bank did not provide any assistance at midday or in the afternoon but it
later revised its liquidity shortage forecast down to Pounds 750m and then
to Pounds 550m.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (10): Indians seek a united voice -
Poverty, discrimination and lack of land are the main concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDIANS have become a significant social force in Ecuador, pressing for
solutions to 500-year-old problems such as land and cultural survival, but
also proposing reforms which would give them far greater autonomy.
The most controversial demand involves a change to the first article of the
national constitution to describe Ecuador as a 'pluri-national' state, on
the grounds that the different Indian groupings are in fact distinct
nationalities, each with its own history, territory, language and
institutions.
Not all the indigenous organisations agree with this change and many
non-Indians believe it could create an explosive situation. 'Indian demands
have got out of proportion,' said Mr Fernando Guerrero, a social democrat
congressman representing the highland province of Chimborazo, where over
half the population is Indian.
'They want to achieve in two or perhaps five years all they didn't get in
500. On the other hand Indians should have their own representatives in
Congress - they should be independent of the political parties, which only
use them.'
Between 25 and 45 per cent of Ecuador's population is classified as Indian,
depending on how an Indian is defined: a man from Otavalo who ties his hair
in the traditional long plaits but wears blue jeans and dark glasses may
call himself an Indian while a poncho-clad Quichua speaking herdsman may
not.
After centuries of exploitation as serfs and cheap labour most highland
Indians are poor; they live off tiny plots of the least accessible and least
productive land on the upper mountain slopes and, as population pressure
mounts, migrate to the cities to take occasional low-paid work.
The Spanish conquerors came soon after the Inca armies when some of the
Andean tribes were still resisting Inca rule. However, Quichua - a dialect
of the Inca language - spread throughout the highlands and down to the Napo
area of the Amazon lowlands.
Since 1988 bilingual education has been officially incorporated into the
education system and there are about 1,000 bilingual Indian teachers in the
countryside. Although Quichua is the most widely used of the eight Indian
languages - about 30 per cent of Ecuadoreans speak it - other Indian groups,
such as the Amazon Shuar, also have their own bilingual schools.
The Catholic church has played an important part in reaffirming Indian
languages and cultural values over the past 20 years, in contrast with its
early efforts to wipe out all indigenous beliefs and impose 'civilised'
Christianity on the people.
The stronger Indian organisations - including the Confederation of Indian
Nationalities of Ecuador, CONAIE - were originally Catholic influenced.
'They tend to have a more aggressive view and are fierce about preserving
cultural roots,' said Mr Guerrero.
Although both religious and political issues divide the Indians, their main
concerns - land, poverty and discrimination - are the same. Hundreds of
communities joined the Indian uprising of mid-1990, blocking roads, invading
haciendas and marching through the provincial capitals. The Indian movement
virtually took over the highlands, speaking with a united voice and forcing
the government to address the land problem.
Earlier this year over 2,000 Amazon Indians marched up from the Pastaza
forests to the capital and camped out in a central park. Once again, the
main issue was land. But while the highland Indians are fighting for the
redistribution of large, expensively farmed haciendas, the Amazon groups
want legal title to long occupied forest lands which are now being
infiltrated by new settlers, gold panning families and oil companies. The
Pastaza Indians won about half their territory and are drawing up a forest
management plan for the reserve.
The 100,000 Amazon Indians are unexpectedly well organised and were the
driving force behind the formation of CONAIE. Sedentary groups are trying to
develop survival strategies combining mixed farming with the sustainable
harvest of forest products. But much of the forest in the northern part of
the region has already been cut down and the Indians often take jobs with
the oil companies.
The new administration is taking the Indian question seriously, says Mr Jose
Quimbo, who is in charge of the Indian Affairs Office attached to the
presidency.
Clad in the dark blue wool poncho and felt hat that identify him as an
Otavalo Indian, he describes the thinking behind the government's Indian
plan. 'Land is a priority - not just the transfer of land because that
hasn't resolved many of the problems. Indians have to be trained to run our
own projects and be incorporated into the development process and not depend
on the state.'
Mr Quinbo's own area is relatively prosperous compared with, say Chimborazo.
Newly cobbled roads carry regular bus services and the houses are being
white washed. It is not the small, oxen-ploughed maize fields that
underwrite such improvements but a flourishing craft industry and a regular
flow of tourists.
Many of the highland Indian communities lack drinking and irrigation water,
health centres, power and above all adequate access roads. It is often
simply not worth paying the cost of transporting a few sacks of potatoes
down the mountain to market.
Last month President Sixto Duran Ballen set a precedent by meeting CONAIE
representatives. 'It gives importance to our problems,' said a member of
CONAIE, who is, however, critical of the government's plan. 'It seems to be
the same sort of thing as before, providing latrines and hand-outs and not
taking on the real difficulties.'
In spite of their success in drawing public attention, the Indians are not
considering taking on the political establishment as yet. The differences
between the organisations are not insuperable, said a Shuar Indian, but 'it
is too soon for a political party. We have to go slowly and learn how to
think ahead and how to work with each other'.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (8): Potential earnings enormous - The
government's plans aim to turn tourism into the country's biggest industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With the intent of forging tourism into the number one economic activity of
the country, the nearly four-month-old government of president Sixto Duran
Ballen is etching out, for the first time in Ecuador's history, a long-term
development plan for the industry.
An indication of his commitment is that the president has formed a ministry
of tourism and information which is to revise applicable laws, promote
tourism abroad and co-ordinate the industry's development.
Tourism ranks fourth after petroleum, bananas, and shrimp in the generation
of foreign currency. In 1991 the tourist industry itself generated nearly
Dollars 200m in direct revenues, but its impact on the rest of the economy
is estimated to be three times as big. In the same year approximately
380,000 visitors came to the country, of which 40 per cent came from
Colombia, 18 per cent from the US, 17 per cent from Europe and 11 per cent
from Peru.
According to CETUR, the government's tourist agency and now technical arm of
the ministry, Ecuador's tourism industry in 1991 had a lodging capacity of
58,000 travellers and employed approximately 35,000 workers. Of the 1,400
hotels, hostels and pensions to choose from in the country only roughly a
dozen can be considered first class.
The biggest tourist attraction in Ecuador has been and continues to be the
Galapagos Archipelago. More than 40,000 visitors came to see exotic
penguins, the famous giant tortoises or tree-sized sunflowers last year.
Boat cruise operators are putting pressure on the government to increase the
permissible number of visitors.
Yet the Charles Darwin Foundation, charged with conducting research and
aiding in environmental protection, warns that the islands' delicate
ecosystem is already being overtaxed by the number of visitors.
However, the potential for tourism to grow in mainland Ecuador is enormous
say industry analysts and travel entrepreneurs. 'Ecuador has more', has been
the slogan with which the private sector has sought to promote areas other
than the Galapagos.
Ecuador's immense geographical and cultural diversity indeed make it a
traveller's paradise. Beaches, snow-capped volcanoes, Indian markets, quaint
colonial towns and Amazon rainforest can all be reached in little more than
an hour's journey from Quito.
A favourable exchange rate makes Ecuador an inexpensive country for most
foreigners. In addition, the country's political stability gives it an
advantage over its neighbours Peru and Colombia, where the governments are
still battling against leftist insurgents.
'The potential has always been there,' says Mr Eduardo Proano president of
Metropolitan Touring, Ecuador's largest tour operator. 'But in the past the
government's efforts to promote tourism abroad have been minimal. Tourism
has been largely a private-sector activity.'
According to Mr Patrick Barrera of the private sector trade association
Feprotur, the key to developing Ecuador's tourist potential is to further
engage in eco-tourism - the branch of the industry that offers the country's
natural beauty and diversity, while simultaneously protecting it.
Ecuador has already been practicing organised eco-tourism not only in the
Galapagos but also in the Amazon region. Metropolitan Touring has been
operating a luxury boat cruise on the Napo and Aguarico rivers for 18 years
and now offers a range of holiday packages to the area.
As well as allowing visitors to view the unspoiled flora and fauna of the
Amazon jungle in Cuyabeno national reserve in north-eastern Ecuador, nature
guides on board educate tourists on the importance of conserving the
wildlife they have come to see.
Eco-tourism not only provides local communities with an alternative to
farming and hunting, but the fee that foreigners have to pay to enter the
national parks helps finance the park management, which is still inadequate.
How tourism affects the behaviour of indigenous groups in these remote areas
remains to be seen. Yet in Cuyabeno the Cofan tribe, which illustrates the
Amazon's medicinal plants and sells handicrafts to tourists, seems to be
benefiting from the influx of visitors.
One of the areas that the government and Metropolitan Touring are developing
for eco-tourism is the national park Machalilla, on Ecuador's central coast.
Machalilla not only includes a tropical dry forest, a cloud forest and the
island La Plata with bird life like that of the Galapagos islands - the bird
count actually exceeds that of Galapagos - but it also harbours
archeological sights of one of the oldest civilisations in the Americas.
With the help of a three-year development plan designed by Feprotur, the
government seeks to provide the necessary infrastructure to allow organised
tours to operate in the park.
According to the plan the park will be spared grand-scale hotel complexes
which might endanger the delicate balance of the ecosystem. Rather the
facilities - including visitors centres and hiking paths - are to blend in
with the environment as much as possible. Negotiations to finance the
project are under way with private and institutional investors, including
foreign ones.
Not only is eco-tourism a reasonable strategy because of the type of natural
resources Ecuador offers, it is also reasonable because of its low cost and
relatively short implementation time. The plan to develop Machalilla Park,
for example, is estimated to cost Dollars 150,000. With these types of
projects Mr Carlos Solorzano, the sub-secretary of tourism, expects positive
results in the short to medium range.
With the reform of the foreign investment law under way, Mr Solorzano hopes
the tourist industry will attract enough capital to develop other potential
tourists sites, especially in the hotel sector. The government is also
exploring the possibility of converting the country's foreign debt into what
would amount to 'debt-for-tourism swaps'. Such financial mechanisms have
already been employed in Mexico and Venezuela.
One of the main activities of the newly created ministry is to promote
Ecuador as a tourist destination abroad. According to Mr Solorzano the
government intends to collaborate closely with Feprotur, which already
operates a promotional office in Miami.
Yet the success of eco-tourism in the long run will depend on the ability of
the government to manage the diverging demands that exist on Ecuador's
natural resources. Miners, loggers and settlers are invading parks and other
protected areas at an alarming rate, thus endangering the very asset of
eco-tourism - the country's ecological diversity and natural beauty.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (7): Oil policy at centre of a political
storm - Energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW government's energy minister, Mr Andres Barreiro, has had the
political spotlight on him since taking office.
He put the case for Ecuador's withdrawal from the Organisation of Petroleum
Exporting Countries and has borne the brunt of public anger over fuel and
electricity price increases. Furthermore, he still faces 'trial' by Congress
which could force his resignation - a threat that leaves oil policy in limbo
at a crucial stage in the new administration.
However, the price adjustments were an unavoidable hurdle in the
government's programme to cut subsidies and rationalise fuel use and as such
have been welcomed by the financial sector. Years of undercharging have left
the main electricity companies with a large debt and Ecuador without the new
projects needed to ensure future supplies. If the rains are unkind and the
change to daylight saving time does not reduce consumption, the minister
will have to take the unpopular step of reintroducing power rationing.
One of the main reasons for leaving Opec was the decision to raise crude
production well beyond Ecuador's quota of 275,000 barrels per day (bpd).
Although output has been 10 to 20 per cent above this level for some time,
Opec has turned a blind eye rather than force the issue and lose a member,
albeit a country that represented only 1 per cent of production. Being in
the organisation also gave prestige to a small nation and fed nationalist
sympathies in Ecuador.
Production is due to increase by 60 to 70,000 bpd during 1993, taking total
output up to about 390,000 bpd by the end of the year. Between 1994 and 1996
another 100,000 bpd could be available but this will depend on the
production agreements reached with foreign companies now developing fields
in the Napo and Pastaza areas of the Amazon region. Oil reserves currently
stand at about 1.5bn barrels.
Some 120,000 bpd are used for domestic consumption and the growth in output
will generate more for the treasury as well as extra foreign income. In the
first eight months of this year earnings from crude oil rose by 15 per cent
to Dollars 804m, mainly because of the bigger volume of exports.
Not one new exploration contract was signed under the last government and
foreign companies operating in Ecuador are hoping for solutions to a series
of contractual problems. 'When they began investing in the mid-'80s they
were expecting to produce light crude at good prices - but instead some have
heavy crude at under Dollars 17 a barrel,' said Mr Fernando Santos, a former
oil minister.
The government is anxious to encourage further exploration and plans to
reform the oil law and change tax regulations. Areas in the north-east
reserved for the state oil company, Petroecuador, will be opened up and a
number of blocks will probably be put on offer in mid-1993, once the reforms
are approved. The north eastern Amazon is close to existing infrastructure
and good quality oil has been found at shallow depths. This area is also
away from the more problematic Indian-occupied areas.
'Ecuador has excellent potential, though the Indian question is sensitive,'
said a foreign company oil executive. 'The pre-Cretaceous has not been
touched but drilling costs would be higher, it is deeper and technically
more difficult.'
Nearly all Ecuador's oil is produced in the Amazon and Indians and the
environment have become high profile issues. Ecological groups have taken up
the Indian banner, campaigning to prevent the development of oil fields in
national parks and Indian reserves.
Conoco, a subsidiary of US group Du Pont, which put out a 'green'
development plan for heavy crude deposits in Waorani Indian territory, left
Ecuador after protracted negotiations had failed to conciliate all the
different interest groups.
Maxus Energy, a Texas oil company, took over from Conoco as operator and is
starting to build a road from the river Napo into the production area. This
is the most controversial element of the project because in the past roads
have channelled thousands of new settlers into the forest and Indian lands.
'The armed forces have promised strict controls so no colonists will pass
along the roads, the agrarian reform institute must not recognise any
settlement of the land,' said Mr Manuel Navarro, head of Petroecuador's
environmental unit.
The Waorani case is the most complicated - the Indians are a small,
semi-nomadic group, especially vulnerable to outside influence and
manipulation. Recently some of the Waorani were brought to Quito and camped
out in front of Maxus' offices until the cold drove them back to the Amazon.
'A moratorium on oil development in these areas is impossible so we must
minimise impact. Now the environmental unit is in on everything from the
pre-feasibility stage,' said Mr Navarro. An environmental audit of Texaco,
which operated in the main Amazon fields for 20 years, is due to start this
month.
The future of Petroecuador and all its subsidiaries is still under
discussion. Parts of the oil industry may be privatised - for example, the
refineries on the Santa Elena peninsula and some of the retailing business.
Big investments in infrastructure are needed, including a new pipeline over
the Andes mountains if Amazon production goes above 400,000 bpd.
But it is not clear how far the government will go on privatisation, given
the strength of the oil trades unions, the convenience of a state income and
the nationalism attached to oil issues.
The electricity sector - particularly the distribution end - is also a
candidate for privatisation in the long term. Three quarters of Ecuador's
generating capacity is hydroelectric, although small thermal plants are
being set up. The Paute scheme, which supplies a third of the country's
power, is threatened by the quantity of sediment accumulating in the
reservoir. Construction of a dam higher up the river to control the problem
has been postponed several times but is now to go ahead, according to the
government.
In spite of a plethora of plans and studies of energy alternatives, Ecuador
has never had a comprehensive energy policy. Natural gas in the Gulf of
Guayaquil remains undeveloped, and extensive fuels such as diesel are used
in thermal power stations. The government has made a start by trying to
rationalise consumption but there is still a long way to go.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (6): Bold steps taken to open the doors to
trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECUADOREANS have long been terrified of the prospect of opening up their
economy to international competition. It was widely assumed that a small
predominantly agricultural economy of 11m people with a small, presumably
inefficient group of import substitution industries would fare badly if the
borders were opened.
The new government of President Sixto Duran Ballen has, however, taken a
bolder approach following the example of Mexico, which through the North
American Free Trade Agreement is trying to tie itself to the economic giant
to its north.
The speed with which the government has acted on this has been impressive in
a country where the bureaucracy traditionally moves slowly.
The initial moves have been with its neighbours. In October, tariffs between
Ecuador, Colombia and Bolivia were abolished and Venezuela is scheduled to
join the free-trade zone in January.
This is in spite of problems within the Andean Pact - the recently revived
trade grouping which brings Ecuador together with Peru, Bolivia, Colombia
and Venezuela.
Problems arose partly because of the breakdown of diplomatic relations
between Venezuela and Peru due to the suspension in April of the
constitution by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori. From the Ecuadorean
perspective, the pact improves Ecuador's negotiating position.
According to government officials, a priority is Chile, a country with which
trade has traditionally been light. While the two economies are not seen as
natural partners, they are said to complement one another.
Another reason to move ahead with the lifting of trade barriers was the
level of illicit cross-border trade that is already taking place.
Official figures suggest Ecuador's exports to Colombia in 1991 were Dollars
31.9m, about 2 per cent of total non-petroleum exports, and imports of
Dollars 94.5m. Yet smuggling is so widespread, the actual trade may be as
much as four times higher.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (5): Relief not without a price - Moves to
reduce the debt overhang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ecuadorean government and most of its creditors agree on one thing: a
resolution to the country's foreign debt problem will not be possible
without debt relief.
Ecuador's foreign debt as a ratio of gross national product is the highest
among the larger debtors in South America - 120 per cent. While far below
the levels of many debtor countries in Africa and war-torn Nicaragua, the
ratio is higher than Bolivia's 100 per cent and double that of Peru.
Because it makes only partial payments on that debt, the interest burden has
in recent years been at levels comparable with most heavily indebted Latin
countries at around 15 per cent of exports.
Nonetheless, the country suffers from a 'debt overhang', a debt burden so
high that its sheer size inhibits investment and blocks growth.
The previous government's unwillingness to seek a more permanent solution to
the debt problem 'has represented a high cost to the country because it has
inhibited incoming capital and the repatriation of capital by Ecuadoreans',
according to Mr Alberto Dahik, the country's vice-president.
'This has put the country at the margin of international capital flows that
have benefited other Latin American countries after they reached agreements
with their creditors,' he said.
The government appears determined to reduce the overhang, and as a signal of
this is starting talks with bank creditors led by Lloyds Bank of Britain in
early December in New York.
'Of course we can't pay it; we need debt relief,' said Mr Dahik, who is
playing an important role in shaping economic policy. The government was
prepared to 'use all possible mechanisms and be flexible', he said.
With the example of Mexico before them, it is now conventional wisdom in
Latin American countries that the confidence effects of a debt relief deal
are an essential part of an economic reform programme.
But unlike in Mexico - which never missed a scheduled interest payment  -
and as in other countries such as Argentina, a bank debt relief programme
under the Brady plan may lead to an increase in actual debt servicing, even
though scheduled debt servicing falls. This is almost certain to happen in
the short-term as debt service arrears - according to the government, a
total Dollars 3.7bn of an overall Dollars 12.3bn debt - are tackled.
This in turn is likely to lead to a lively internal debate about the merits
of raising debt servicing levels. The government has already said it intends
to devote 38 per cent of its 1993 budget to debt servicing, compared with 25
per cent this year.
Apart from clearing arrears and tackling internal opposition, bankers say
there are other difficulties facing a government which they believe
genuinely wants to deal with the debt issue.
With a bank debt of roughly Dollars 4 1/2 bn of principal and Dollars 2 1/4
bn of interest arrears, the government may lack finance for so-called
'enhancements', the guarantees to the concessional bonds which banks agree
to take in exchange for their debt.
These enhancements are usually made up of funds from the international
financial institutions - the International Monetary Fund, World Bank and
InterAmerican Development Bank - together with other resources a government
can pull together from its own reserves.
The government is embarking on talks with the IMF on what may be a two-year
standby loan, expected to be agreed early in the new year, after which World
Bank and IADB funds may fall into place, and a rescheduling from the Paris
Club of creditor governments may take place.
However, reserves with which to finance enhancements are not large. After
falling earlier this year to near crisis levels, they have since increased
four-fold to Dollars 750m. Indeed, the fall in reserves appears to be why
the government has not been able to make an interest payment to banks since
July.
The government has in recent years been paying, in intermittent payments,
Dollars 140m a year to banks - equivalent to 25-30 per cent of that falling
due.
The lack of a payment since July has probably contributed to a fall in the
price of the bank debt in the secondary market to around 27 cents on the
dollar. The price peaked in the low 30s in mid-year amid expectations that
the incoming government would rapidly move to settle its foreign debts. The
low of about 15 cents was reached in 1990.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (4): Survival of stocks a concern - The
rapid expansion of the fishing industry needs to be checked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE threat to stocks caused by the unchecked growth of Ecuador's fishing
industry over the past 20 years is giving fishing authorities and the
government increasingly bad headaches.
Earlier this year 14 especially equipped boats - mainly Japanese and Korean
 -began fishing for squid off the coast of Ecuador. 'There had been no study
of this resource . . . we can't allow commercial exploitation without
finding out how this will affect the resource and other species,' said Mr
Gustavo Gonzalez, under secretary for fisheries. Squid fishing has been
stopped, pending the results of a study being carried out with Japanese
help.
Concerns focus on the survival sardine, mackerel, anchovy and other stocks.
'We're going to remodel fishing policy,' said Mr Gonzalez, 'aiming for a
sustainable use of resources, imposing closed season and restrictions.'
Independent experts agree that a revaluation of policy is long overdue but
doubt whether the government will be willing or able to enforce licences,
strict quotas and other measures required for effective management. Apart
from the lack of funds for field trips and resource studies, policing the
fishing force all along the Pacific coast would be virtually impossible.
Shrimp farming - a profitable business which has turned shrimps into
Ecuador's third export earner - is a case in point. Although the government
has banned the cutting of mangroves to make way for new ponds, shrimp
farmers who travel the winding channels of the Guayas estuary say that
deforestation continues, often in full view of the authorities. Sometimes an
outer band of mangroves is left as camouflage.
Ecuador's shrimp farms cover large areas of land with relatively low
investment in infrastructure. The country has over 120,000 hectares of
ponds, many of them extending over 10 hectares or more. Yields are low
compared with south-east Asia, where farming is much more intensive.
Land along the tidal flats is cheap and the climate perfectly suited for two
or more shrimp harvests a year. Earnings for 1991 reached Dollars 491m and,
in spite of a drop in international prices, this year's figure is running
close to the same level. Over two thirds of exports go to the US and most of
the remainder to Spain and France.
However, even shrimp farmers have problems: 'I wouldn't choose to invest in
shrimps if I were starting up now,' said Mr Fernando Felix, who has 30
hectares of ponds. 'Devaluation has benefited the exporters but not the
producers and our costs - pumps, seed, fuel - have gone up a lot. The profit
margin has dropped far below what it used to be.'
An outbreak of modern piracy in the Gulf of Guayaquil - once sailed by
British and Dutch pirate ships - has also unsettled producers, forcing many
boats set out for island shrimp farms with armed guards in the prow.
As nearly all the shrimp and fishing operations are in private hands,
privatisation will have little impact on this sector. The national fishing
company, EPNA, with assets worth about Dollars 1m, is to be liquidated,
according to Mr Gonzalez, while a new fishing law to allow the modernisation
of institutions and regulations is being drafted.
'We also need to do a second fisheries census to support political decisions
 -the first was 20 years ago and from 1972 there has been a big increase in
fishing.'
Over the past decade the total volume of fishery products exported has
barely changed, but there has been a big re-shuffle within the sector;
canned and fishmeal exports have dropped while frozen shrimps and fish have
taken their place.
In canning and fishmeal plants the average use of processing capacity is
under 25 per cent and catches are so poor that both have difficulty covering
operating costs. However, fishing exports (excluding shrimps) brought in
nearly Dollars 100m last year and experts believe there is still
considerable commercial potential in certain areas as long as controls are
applied.
Overall, fishing and shrimp farming provide a living for nearly 10 per cent
of the workforce. The artisanal sector, which has grown enormously over the
past 10 years, is particularly important in terms of employment and becoming
more so as jobless banana workers drift into the fishing villages. Here too
there is concern that coastal stocks are being overfished - although the
number of boats increased by a factor of six during the 1980s, the annual
harvest barely tripled and fishermen reported dwindling returns.
The government is helping artisanal fishermen by providing low priced fuel
and better marketing channels as well as new diversification programmes.
Conflicts between the artisanal sector and the shrimp trawling fleet reflect
the pressure on stocks with each blaming the other for reduced catches and
earnings. Although Ecuadorian law does not allow tuna boats to fish on
dolphins, large number of turtles have apparently been taken in shrimp
trawls and turtle exclusion devices are being tested.
Traditionally weak in influence, the fishing authorities are also - like
most of the bureaucracy subject to current austerity measures - starved of
funds and of personnel to ensure conservation measures are followed. Mr
Gonzalez believes that the only realistic way to implement controls is by
discussing them with fishermen and enlisting support for better management -
but this has not proved to be an effective strategy in the past.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (2): Measures are having some success -
The stabilisation plan aims to reduce the budget deficit and keep inflation
at under 30 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ECUADOREAN economy, which derives nearly half of fiscal income and 45
per cent of export earnings from oil, has been through a few sharp ups and
many downs in the past 10 years.
Underlying problems include chronic budget deficits and inflation,
deteriorating wages and an increasing concentration of income, low domestic
and foreign investment, corruption and inefficiency in the public sector.
Successive attempts to stabilise the economy by the past three governments
have barely scraped the surface.
However, the new administration's macroeconomic plan has found favour with
bankers and appears to be producing results.
The sucre was initially devalued by 35 per cent and then allowed to float
between l,700 and 2,000 to the dollar, with the central bank intervening to
keep it below 2,000. The idea is to boost exports and reduce expectations of
further devaluations, while allowing an ample margin for price adjustment.
Launched on September 3, the stabilisation plan's measures also included:
Raising petrol and most other fuel prices by 125 per cent or more;
Increased electricity tariffs on a sliding scale varying from nought to 120
per cent;
Cuts in state spending; Freezing of recruitment in the public sector - a
significant saving in a country where new governments normally addseveral
hundred to the existing number of civil servants in order to pay off
political debts.
These and other measures are designed to bring the budget deficit down to a
manageable level and keep inflation at under 30 per cent next year.
Although the monthly inflation rate shot up immediately after the plan was
launched, it fell back to 1 per cent in November, to the relief of economic
authorities. International reserves have more than tripled to Dollars 800m
since September, helped by the fact that importers had stocked up earlier in
the year.
However, the immediate inflationary costs of stabilisation are clear and the
government has so far done little to mitigate them. It will be difficult to
keep annual wage increases down to the 30 per cent level.
The next stage of the plan entails extensive restructuring and privatisation
and is one of the main elements of the modernisation policy. The public
sector is involved in some 170 companies, many of them originally privately
owned and propped up by the state when they collapsed.
Although a detailed strategy is still being drawn up, Mr Pablo Lucio
Paredes, of the National Development Council, outlines three main areas for
privatisation:
First, state shares in relatively small companies such as the National
cement works, the Hotel Colon and some banks, will be sold through the stock
exchange in a matter of months.
The second group, consisting of medium-sized companies in state hands - for
example the Aztra sugar refinery and the Selva Alegre cement plant - are
also relatively short-term, uncomplicated cases. The third group, the state
monopolies, will require special legislation. Each case in this group will
be handled individually but the government has already made it clear that
virtually everything - apart from a few 'strategic' companies - is on the
table.
Communications, oil, electricity, the ports, water provision, the main
airline and even the politically controversial Social Security Institute,
are included. Nearly all of these organisations need large investments and
new technology and some may be broken up into several smaller companies.
The Quito and Guayaquil stock markets, as yet very small, could be in for a
boom. 'The first phase of privatisation represents companies with Dollars
200m-Dollars 250m in state shares,' said Mr Edison Ortiz, president of the
Quito stock exchange. 'It is important that all the dealings should be
absolutely transparent.
'This will help open up the market to more people. Investors here think
stocks are just for the rich. Foreign participation is allowed but it has
not developed.'
Although foreign investments have remained under Dollars 80m a year
recently, the privatisation programme is already attracting interest from
the US, Japan and the EC.
In principle, the government plans to offer foreign investors the same
conditions as nationals.
This means changing the tax system, removing restrictions in sectors such as
telecommunications and streamlining regulations.
One new area of special interest is mining - although the country has rich
gold and other mineral deposits, invasions by prospectors and inadequate
legislation have deterred foreign companies.
'When we have the framework and the regulations ready, investment will
come,' Mr Paredes said.
Mr Paredes is less confident about the question of labour:
'It's bound to be conflictive. Public employees must share in the
privatisation process, there should be training for those who become
unemployed . . . we must convince people that privatisation is all right.'
A National Council for Modernisation has been set up by the government to
recommend and carry through the necessary legal reforms.
Its director Mr German Penaherrera, who is also an alternate congressman,
says: 'Apart from privatisation, we are working to co-ordinate
decentralisation, de-bureaucratisation and deregulation.
'There are too many contradictory laws and rules, we need fewer, clearer,
ones. Every piece of paper is a potential for corruption.'
A new anti-corruption unit is to investigate cases speedily and ensure
charges are brought.
The cornerstone of the strategy to rationalise public spending emerged with
last month's budget law.
Although it did not go through congress exactly as drafted, the law stops a
multitude of special allocations to individual institutions and allows the
minister of finance to control outgoings. The government also plans to
strike at hidden subsidies, such as long delays in paying bills for public
services.
The next three months will be crucial, both for the start up of the
privatisation programme and for the effects of the stabilisation plan.
Economic growth for 1992 is expected to be around 2.5 per cent and next
year's figure may be lower - barely level with the population growth rate of
2.2 per cent.
But for the moment the government has made inflation its primary target and,
judging by the remarkably quick deceleration in the cost of living, it seems
to be having some success in this area.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (3): Banana trade faces an uncertain
future - Agriculture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND COLITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANANA production, the cornerstone of Ecuador's agriculture, is facing
change. Not only are exports threatened by European restrictions, but
domestic overproduction, the Sigatoka disease and low per acre productivity
will also demand action by producers.
Last year Ecuador produced a record 3.5m tonnes of bananas. The increase
over previous years (3m tonnes in 1990 and 2.5m tonnes in 1989) is largely
due to new plantations started in 1990 and 1991 - when banana prices rose -
and which have now come into production. These largely unauthorised
plantations are ballooning the supply and depressing prices.
Of great concern to Ecuador is the reform of the European Community's banana
import regime with proposals to impose a banana import quota of 2m tonnes
next year and tariff on 'dollar bananas' imported from exporters from Latin
America of up to 70 per cent. Ecuador last year exported 2.7m tonnes of
bananas worth nearly Dollars 800m.
Restrictions would affect a large percentage of Ecuador's banana exports.
Approximately 40 per cent of the fruit it produces is sold to the EC.
While the spread of the Black Sigatoka disease, which has endangered the
tropical fruit for some time, has been halted, it is not likely to be
eradicated. Measures introduced by the French Institute of Fruit and Citrus
Investigations, part of an aid programme of the French government, have had
much success in combating Sigatoka, but have not able to eliminate it
completely.
The productivity of Ecuador's banana fields is below that of its world
competitors. While the productivity in Honduras is 2,800 boxes per hectare
and 3,000 in Costa Rica, Ecuador merely produces 1,400 boxes per hectare.
Yet lower overall costs make Ecuador competitive internationally.
To give producers an incentive while continuing to protect consumers, the
government is to implement a price reform of the principal agricultural
goods whose prices have so far remained fixed.
Supply and demand will determine the prices of sugar, rice, maize, soya,
milk and barley within a certain parameter set by the ministry of
agriculture. The bottom end of the price bracket will ensure farmers a
minimum revenue. When prices hit the top end, distributors are allowed to
search for cheaper imports on the international market.
The importance of coffee and cacao, which cover nearly a third of the area
sown with primary agricultural products, is likely to decrease. Given low
prices and an over-supply of coffee on world markets, agriculture minister
Mr Mariano Gonzales Portes has indicated that some of the coffee
cultivations will eventually have to be replaced with other crops.
In spite of a sugar cane production of over 3.5m tonnes annually, Ecuador
has had to import sugar this year. Producers hope to cover domestic demand
next year but need considerable credits from the Andean Development
Corporation to do so.
Few major crops have seen their production increase significantly recently.
One exception is the soya bean; its production has nearly quadrupled in the
past years and is expected to grow in the future.
One of the reasons producers have not been able to significantly increase
the yield of their crops in past years, says Mr Gonzales, has been the lack
of sufficient investment in agricultural research. Only 0.3 per cent of
gross domestic product has gone into agricultural research in the past
years, he says.
The government plans to reverse that trend and, with the help of the
Institute of Agricultural Investigations which became autonomous only in
July, intends to promote new and higher-yielding agricultural products.
INIAP has recently developed a new type of yuca whose yield is three times
that of the traditional type when processed into flour and 10 times as high
when processed into starch.
The institute also engages in other activities, such as giving technical
advice to indigenous groups in the central province of Chimborazo on the
cultivation of the traditional crop quinua. This cereal, grown by the Incas
centuries ago, has a high nutritional value.
Although a promising crop, the efficient commercialisation of quinua is
difficult, says Mr Gonzales, because of the unfavourable size of land
parcels in the areas in which quinua is grown. Land holdings in the
mountainous Sierra region are much smaller than in the coast and are
typically used for subsistence farming.
Thirty per cent of land holdings in the Sierra are classified as small (10
hectares or less), while 52 per cent are medium sized (10 to 100 hectares)
and only 18 per cent are more than 100 hectares. Land holdings in the
coastal provinces of Manabi, Guayas, and Los Rios are generally larger and
used in commercial monoculture such as banana, cacao or coffee.
In the past two-and-a-half decades the amount of land used for livestock
production has more than tripled to nearly 5m hectares, which in part
explains Ecuador's dazzling rate of deforestation. Settlers continue to
slash-and-burn as a way to clear areas of forest on which to grow beans and
maize for one season before turning it into pasture.
The most rapid expansion of pasture has occured in the coastal areas,
especially in the province of Esmeraldas where huge tracts of land have been
cleared by settlers as well as lumber companies. In the Sierra the increase
of pasture is more due to the abandonment of agricultural activities.
A large potential for growth lies in Ecuador's horticulture, according to Mr
Gonzales, especially tropical fruits but also flowers which have found an
increasingly strong market in the US and Europe.
Yet the volatility in the production of such fruits for the export market is
exemplified by the Babaco fruit. Production in 1987 reached 3,834 tonnes but
then steadily declined over the years and in 1991 equalled only 510 tonnes.
Although outside the hurricane zone, Ecuador suffers repeatedly from the
shifting precipitation patterns caused by the Pacific current El Nino. The
current carries warmer waters to the coast and causes droughts in some parts
of the country and floods in others. This year 22 people were killed and
30,000 hectares of rice, banana, cotton and maize crops were lost. The
damage in the coastal areas alone is estimated to have been Dollars 70m.
At a time when droughts have caused hydroelectric plants to reduce their
output, the government plans to revive a decade-old project to irrigate
nearly 30,000 hectares of arable land on the Santa Helena peninsula west of
the port city Guayaquil. The four dams along the river Daule are also to
provide the area with electricity and drinking water. So far Brazil, Italy
and Spain have agreed to co-finance the project.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Survey of Ecuador (1): In for a rough ride - While the new
administration's economic reforms have had some success, the foreign debt
burden, proposed EC trade barriers and a fragmented congress mean that
Ecuador's way forward will be long and hard
</HEADLINE>

THE government of President Sixto Duran Ballen has moved quickly on its
election pledge to modernise the Ecuadorean economy. But as a result, in the
four months it has been in power, the administration has been buffeted by
dozens of strikes and by protests from squads throwing rocks. It has fumbled
to find a coherent political voice and narrowly escaped losing two ministers
to a Congress hungry for impeachment.
All of this is standard fare in Ecuadorean politics, but the fact that the
government, in which businessmen are spearheading the programme of economic
reform, was not even granted the normal honeymoon period is an indication of
how great a struggle the modernisation process will be.
In spite of the optimism that accompanied the changeover from military to
civilian rule in 1979, Ecuador lost ground during the 1980s: income per
capita dropped by 7.5 per cent and at the end of the decade some 60 per cent
of the population was living in poverty.
The oil boom of the 1970s, administered by the military, had provided new
roads, schools, hospitals and powerstations, but the subsequent price slide
of crude combined with a heavy foreign debt left the nation stranded in the
same inertia as many other Latin American countries.
Most of Ecuador's 11m people are concentrated in the high Andean basins or
on the tropical Pacific lowlands. For a country with such a complex climate
and geography - ridges and valleys harbour plant and animal species
inhabiting only a few square miles - it is surprisingly compact and
accessible. Yet the highland-coastal division runs through many aspects of
life, fostering rivalries that can undermine governments.
Quito, which was once the northern capital of the Inca empire, houses much
of the overblown bureaucracy that Mr Duran Ballen has promised to dismember.
The 430,000 public sector employees account for over a quarter of employment
and the state is so centralised that even the Galapagos regional development
institute is located in Quito.
While the Quito-based administration traditionally controls oil income
distribution, Guayaquil is Ecuador's business capital and main port. It is
also the biggest city, with more than half its 1.6m people packed into vast
shanty towns where politicians trade sewerage pipes for votes. The
atmosphere is tough and dynamic, the buildings squarely graceless, unlike
the settled prettiness of Quito's church cupolas.
Bananas, shrimp and cocoa products (Ecuador's main exports after oil) are
shipped out through the port of Guayaquil - an enclave where customs
inspectors fear to tread. This and other ports are on the government list
for modernisation and a switch to a concession system has been proposed.
Geography also dictates presidential formulae: Mr Duran Ballen is the
highlander (although actually born in Boston), while vice-president Mr
Alberto Dahik represents the coast.
They appear complementary in other ways too. The president's 71 years and
consensus-seeking concern is offset by Mr Dahik's young aggressive economic
expertise. However, in discussions behind the scenes the president is
reportedly no soft-hearted grandfather.
The previous administration - Mr Rodrigo Borja's social democrat government
 -began to open up the economy and liberalise trade over the past year, but
it also bequeathed a significant budget deficit of 7 per cent of gross
domestic product.
The new administration has launched a predictably unpopular 'macroeconomic
stabilisation plan' designed to cut the 52 per cent annual inflation rate,
control public spending and replenish Ecuador's international reserves,
which had fallen to Dollars 224m.
At the same time the government has promised a package of structural reforms
to reduce the size of the public sector, improve services and redirect funds
into areas of social priority.
However, to carry through these reforms, which involve privatisation,
attracting foreign investment and undoing interminable red tape, the
government must cajole a fragmented congress into passing large volumes of
legislation.
With the two government parties - the president's Republican Union and Mr
Dahik's Conservative Party - between them lacking even 25 per cent of the
legislature, Mr Duran will have to persuade other right-of-centre groupings
to vote for official policy.
He has moved quickly. At the beginning of the four-year term, when future
candidates are as yet unconcerned about their electoral image, there is a
better chance of getting their backing: Congress passed the first important
government-sponsored law - changes in the regulation of the budget - two
weeks ago.
Many more legal reforms are still to come: these include privatisation, tax
(including foreign investment), oil contracts, property rights, the stock
exchange and public sector contracting procedures. Mr Dahik says he expects
most of these to go through by next August.
But the government is already tackling other problems such as the Dollars
12.3bn foreign debt, which includes Dollars 3.7bn in arrears. Talks with the
commercial banks start this month and Ecuador will be negotiating for a
global but realistic solution.
Although the government has a strong economic policy, however, many cabinet
members lack political experience. Instead of wooing the public and Congress
and stressing the long-term effects of the structural reforms, the
government has floundered in a mass of sometimes contradictory explanations
about privatisation, creating uncertainty and exacerbating strikes and
protests.
The launching of a development strategy with the emphasis on social measures
should help redress the balance - austerity has left the government little
to spend.
'The priority in social policy is to lower inflation and have economic
growth,' said Mr Pablo Lucio Paredes, general secretary of the National
Development Council. 'The role of the state will be first to regulate
markets and ensure competition, and secondly to have social programmes - for
example, health and drinking water services - as well as justice and
defence.'
However, critics of the path chosen by the government argue that such
policies are misguided in a country where more than half the population is
outside the market, with low productivity, minimum education and no capacity
to save, and the modernised industrial and agricultural sector is
over-capitalised, over-protected and extremely inefficient.
Mr Dahik is sanguine. 'It may not be the most efficient private sector but
it is much better than the state.'
Since the relatively benign military dictatorships of the 1970s, the armed
forces have maintained an important role in Ecuadorean society. The army has
shares in companies ranging from aviation to ecotourism.
'This began because the army needed certain supplies such as shoes, and also
wanted to help industry take off when there was a weak business spirit,'
said retired general Jose Gallardo, the minister of defence. 'Now we want to
strengthen private shareholders - perhaps even privatise some companies
completely - and reorient our resources.'
In foreign relations, the government has already taken important steps
towards free trade with Colombia and Venezuela and has begun negotiations
with Chile. But while it is strengthening regional trade links, Europe and
the US are still its main markets. As such, concerns are mounting over
proposed EC import barriers to bananas, total exports of which brought in
Dollars 715m last year.
While a longstanding border problem with Peru eased after talks between the
two presidents, guerrillas and drug traffickers have been under pressure in
Colombia and Peru, and moving into frontier areas.
Isolated incidents persist, but Ecuador has been successful in defusing
incipient rebel groups in the past.
However, the government recognises that drug trafficking has become a
serious problem and realises that the country is no longer merely a transit
centre.
Both cocaine-making laboratories and poppy plantations have been found in
recent months. Estimates of the amount of money which is being laundered
have risen to Dollars 700-Dollars 800m a year, although stricter banking
controls have been introduced.
However, given the catching up that there is to do on so many fronts, many
feel that the government is not moving fast enough.
'Ecuador - especially the social sector - has downgraded more than any other
country in the continent except Peru,' said banker Mr Leon Roldos, former
vice-president of Ecuador.
'A government that wants to put through structural reform must think ahead
beyond the four years. It must get political forces working together and
make people feel a long term commitment.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recipe for tragedy in Bolivia -
Co-operative mining ventures like the one devastated at Llipi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE for the Bolivian government and independent mining organisations to
improve working conditions and safety records is intensifying after the
disaster which earlier this week engulfed the Llipi gold camp in the
Bolivian Andes.
The death toll may never be known. About 100 bodies have been found. But
perhaps as many as 300 miners, their wives and children remain buried under
17 metres of mud and rubble.
The Regional Federation of Gold Mining Co-operatives believes most must be
presumed dead or seriously injured. With access to the site hampered by
treacherous roads made worse by torrential rains, many of the bodies may
never be recovered.
The life of a Bolivian Co-operative miner is a precarious one but depressed
world mineral and hydrocarbon prices mean that the resources necessary to
improve his conditions are simply not available.
Llipi is the latest in a long history of fatal incidents. And one day after
the tragedy, four miners on their way to help the Llipi victims themselves
died when their lorry tipped over on a local road.
Llipi was a new gold ore camp, production having starting relatively
recently. Between 200 and 300 families had established themselve there.
The western Tipuani region, where Llipi is situated, contains the largest
concentration of co-operative miners in Bolivia: some 60 collective
enterprises worked by 6,000 miners with 30,000 dependents.
Tipuani straddles the Andes, at an altitude stretching from 4,000m above sea
level to some 600m in the river valleys. Most of its co-operative operations
mine gold, of producing the greater part of Bolivia's output of the precious
metal.
Declared output by them in 1991 was 1.9 tonnes, compared to a total of 3.5
tonnes. Inti Raymi, a subsidiary of Battle Mountain Gold, was responsible
for most of the rest coming from Bolivia's largest silver-gold open pit
operation.
Official production figures are misleading, however. Dr Fernando Urquidi
Barrau, an expert on the Bolivian mining scene, estimates that the
co-operatives' true annual gold production figure is around 6 to 7 tonnes.
He compares their conditions to those of turn-of-the century gold rushes in
the US and Canada - but worse because of the tropical environment.
Co-operative miners and their families in Bolivia are prone to tuberculosis,
anaemia, and yellow fever. Children commonly die from chronic diarrhoea.
There are no health facilities and no potable water sources.
Diets are poor and housing usually means makeshift adobe or wooden huts with
tin roofs. The average earnings of a Bolivian co-operative miner are
estimated at Dollars 1,200 a year by the Regional Federation of Gold Mining
Co-operatives.
Bolivian co-operatives have a long history. But the tin market crash caused
by the 1985 collapse of the International Tin Council's buffer stock
operation, which resulted in the laying-off of 28,000 state employed miners,
has greatly added to their numbers.
There is no government control or investment in co-operatives, though
Comibol, the state mining corporation, leases some of its operations to
individual groups.
Extraction methods are extremely primitive. Dr Urqidi estimates some 60 to
70 per cent of gold is lost by co-operative prospectors. Shafts are often
built under river beds, leading to frequent collapses and accidents.
Some of the larger co-operative operations have earthmoving equipment,
front-loaders and trucks but most have to make do with rather more primitive
tools.
Local miners attempting to rescue their colleagues at Llipi, for instance,
had the use of just one tractor, picks and shovels for the initial 36 hours
following the landslide. Road access to Llipi, as to many other co-operative
works, is either non-existent or extremely hazardous, particularly in the
rainy season. In totality all these factors amounted to a recipe for
disaster.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Vegetable marketing 'failure'
in the UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IT comes to marketing vegetables, UK growers do not know their onions,
according to a report by Food From Britain published yesterday.
Vegetables accounted for more than Pounds 1bn of the UK's Pounds 5.4bn food
and drink trade deficit last year.
Yet vegetable growers in the UK, while generally larger than competitors,
suffer from a lack of top quality products and fragmented sales
organisation. The UK makes no significant exports.
Supermarkets now account for 50 per cent of the UK market for vegetables,
leaving only 50 per cent traded in traditional markets compared with 90 per
cent in 1980.
Contracts with the supermarket chains have raised the standard of
presentation and produce in the UK. But 'the concentration of buying power
within so few organisations means that significant exporters to the UK can
readily contact the key people.'
This has been seized upon by growers in the Netherlands, where 90 per cent
of produce is sold through auction markets.
The Dutch system meets the need for additional supplies of the right quality
and quantity to meet fluctuations in demand, according to one quoted UK
buyer, whose remarks are 'a damning criticism of the way our marketing is
organised,' FFB concludes.
At the same time changes in Government policy have effectively cut research
spending in half to Pounds 13m since 1989.
FFB is also concerned that the Government does not see its role as 'a
positive force to enable things to happen in agriculture to the same degree
as the governments of other (EC) member sates, but rather as an
administrator.'
Compared with other countries, the 'UK vegetable sector is in the 'also
rans,' partly from lack of a strong base to fund raise and partly from lack
of product to sell,' says the report.
It recommends a drive towards exports, more research spending, attention to
quality and the promotion of a healthy image to counter a decline in
vegetable consumption.
As for those onions, more co-operation is needed. 'The Tasmanian onion
farmers have just six export companies to ship out 60,000 tonnes to the rest
of the world. The UK has more export organisations to ship out just 10,000
tonnes.'

FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Continued pressure on metals
from CIS exports expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES OF the main traded metals in 1993 would continue to be held down by
exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States but they would move up
slightly from present depressed levels, suggested Mr Thomas Baack, chief
economist at Metallgesellschaft, the German mining and metals group,
yesterday.
Production and consumption of the main traded metals in the west would be
roughly in balance next year, but CIS exports would cause a supply surplus.
'At the moment there are no prospects of an improvement in this respect,' he
said. Even so, most present metals prices were 'unsustainably low.'
Introducing MG's annual 'state of the non-ferrous metal markets' report, Mr
Baack said western aluminium and nickel producers - worst affected by the
CIS exports - needed to shut down much more production capacity to
compensate.
He doubted whether Norilsk Nikel, which produces about 80 per cent of the
CIS nickel, would carry out its undertaking to cut production next year.
Mr Baack pointed out that CIS copper exports were likely to rise by 100,000
tonnes to 500,000 tonnes this year but net imports from the former eastern
bloc countries would not change because China would probably import 100,000
tonnes.
In its report, MG suggests that high stocks of aluminium will weigh on
prices next year so they are unlikely to exceed Dollars 1,300 a tonne. (So
far this year the price has averaged Dollars 1,256).
MG assumes there will be a slow recovery of the construction and automotive
industries in the western industrial nations in 1993 which will help
copper's price to average Dollars 2,100 a tonne (Dollars 2,290 so far this
year).
Present extremely low zinc prices will improve in 1993, but only to Dollars
1,300 a tonne (Dollars 1,250), the report suggests.
Lead, having suffered for two years from the depressed state of the US
automotive industry, is currently hampered by a weakness of the Japanese
vehicle-making industry.
So only a slow improvement is expected, giving a average price of Dollars
600 a tonne in 1993 (Dollars 551).

FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fears of unrest in Russia give
boost to oil prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL PRICES moved upwards yesterday in a volatile market where fears over
unrest in Russia outweighed recent supply and demand concerns.
The price of North Sea Brent crude for January delivery gained 50 cents to
Dollars 18.20 a barrel as President Boris Yeltsin appealed for calm in the
streets.
Traders fear that a deepening political crisis in Russia could disrupt
export supplies from the world's biggest oil producer where output has been
slipping dramatically. Russia exports around 2m barrels of oil a day (b/d)
to the west.
If concerns over Russian supplies persist, oil prices could find renewed
strength after the weakness in the market of the past few months which has
seen prices drop by over Dollars 3 a barrel to a seven-month low.
Oil markets have been weakened by perceived over-supply because of a
build-up of product stocks accompanied by low demand and mild weather. The
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' failure to cut its output has
further depressed prices.
Iran indicated yesterday that it was ready to cut production below its new
allocation if prices remained weak. But at the same time Nigeria confirmed
rumours that it had sold several cargoes of oil on a netback basis - cut
price deals which in the past have been associated with sharp drops in the
oil price.
Professor Colin Robinson from Surrey University said the world should
prepare itself for the 'significant possibility,' of another oil price shock
later in the decade.
He told a conference on Oil and Gas Economics in the North Sea that there is
very little spare capacity in the world oil industry and, as demand rises,
any disruption in Middle eastern or Russian politics could cause sharp rises
in price.
But an opposite scenario would see the recovery in demand remaining weak and
capacity growing, which would keep prices low, he said.

London robusta COFFEE prices lost impetus towards the close, easing back to
the day's lows, while COCOA prices fell from their highs to end mixed.
Coffee showed little inclination to move up again after Wednesday's sharp
rally, despite widespread conviction that there was still considerable
potential on the upside. 'The market has had a couple of days over Dollars
1,000 and doesn't know what to do next. It's almost like a touch of
vertigo,' one trader said. On the LME NICKEL prices continued to attract
buying interest on downside dips during another volatile session, and the
market ended higher. Dealers said nickel again traded within a wide range,
with little sign that the current choppy phase was drawing to an end.
Uncertainty over the worsening political atmosphere in Russia induced short
covering on dips. Nymex PALLADIUM was firmer at midday, with analysts
expecting further rises because many players are convinced Russian output
will drop dramatically.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gloomy prospects for tungsten
foreseen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT and industry experts are predicting another difficult year for
the tungsten market in 1993 and no recovery in depressed tungsten prices.
The experts, from 23 countries and the International Tungsten Industry
Association, have been meeting in Geneva this week under the auspices of the
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to review the current
market situation and outlook.
Demand for tungsten has been weakened by lingering world recession. It has
deeply affected key tungsten-using sectors such as the tool-making, motor
vehicle, and defence industries.
Meanwhile, high levels of stocks, competition between tungsten materials and
substitution by other products are adding to the downward pressure on
prices.
Unctad estimates that world tungsten consumption last year amounted to
39,881 tonnes, a 12 per cent drop from 1990.
World production fell further, by 14 per cent to 37,007 tonnes last year.
However, stockpiles in 1991 amounted to more than 40,000 tonnes, with 34,634
tonnes held by the US government as a strategic reserve.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC qualifies quota proposals in
move to break banana trade reform deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC farm officials have moved decisively this week to break the deadlock on
reform of the banana trade, formally cutting adrift from a wholly
quota-based proposal which has split the Community in two.
In its stead, British officials holding the EC presidency have tabled a
combined tariff and quota arrangement which will be debated by farm
ministers on Monday. The UK compromise would involve a 20 per cent tariff on
banana imports up to a quota level that has yet to be negotiated.
Above this level 'very high tariffs' would be imposed - perhaps
significantly higher than the 70 per cent previously discussed. The proposal
calls for 'generous access' for traditional exporters, mainly from the
Caribbean, and a system of import licences.
The proposal follows circulation on November 20 of a British 'non-paper' on
reform, and a whirlwind visit last weekend to a number of Caribbean
exporting countries by Mr John Gummer, Britain's agriculture minister, to
test responses to the idea.
There has been mounting concern that deadlock would create chaos in January
once the creation of the European single market allows free movement of
goods across the Community.
This is because suppliers to countries like Germany, which import cheaper
'dollar' bananas from Latin America, would be able to flood countries like
France and Britain, which buy comparatively expensive bananas from former
colonies, most of them in the Caribbean, under under the Lome Convention
commitments.
UK officials backed away from a pure tariff-based import regime, apparently
convinced that this could not protect traditional suppliers with any
certainty.
They are confident that a combination of quotas and tariffs can protect Lome
commitments, and - unlike a pure quota scheme - would not clash with
obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) for
tariffication of all farm trade.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Malaysian attack on rubber
consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MALAYSIA, the world's third largest producer of natural rubber after
Thailand and Indonesia, has strongly attacked the stand of rubber consumer
countries concerning a new international rubber agreement.
Mr Ahmad Farouk, leader of the Malaysian delegation to a recent meeting here
of the International Natural Rubber Organisation said consumer countries
could not expect producers to list all their proposals for a new rubber
agreement before the consumers themselves had agreed that negotiations on a
new agreement should take place.
'Never before in the history of commodity agreements have details been laid
down before we go to the negotiating table' said Mr Farouk.
After the recent Inro meeting consumers said they must see the producers'
proposals for a new rubber agreement before making a decision on whether to
proceed with negotiations. The present international rubber agreement runs
out at the end of next year, though it can be extended by common agreement
for a maximum period of two years.
Mr Farouk said there was little point in agreeing to an extension of Inra 2
if there was no decision to negotiate on another rubber pact.
'What is the use of an extension if we decide not to renegotiate?' asked Mr
Farouk. 'But if we agree on the need for a new agreement, then we can
consider an extension to accommodate various procedures.'
Meanwhile Mr Sucharit Promdej, the secretary general of the Association of
Natural Rubber Producing Countries has said that his organisation is
preparing itself for the possibility of a breakdown in negotiations for a
new Inra.
The ANRPC is due to meet in Thailand in early January to discuss new price
measures.
Mr Promdej said the ANRPC, which groups Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri
Lanka, India, Papua New Guinea and Singapore, would use supply adjustments
and export quotas to stabilise natural rubber prices.

FT  11 DEC 92 / Government Bonds: European markets retreat as Bundesbank
remains firm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S government bond markets fell yesterday as the Bundesbank reiterated
its determination to quell inflation by keeping German interest rates high.
The news came against a background of further currency turbulence as Norway
decided to cut the krone's link to the Ecu, sparking further speculative
pressure against the weaker European exchange rate mechanism currencies such
as the Danish krone and the French franc.
GERMAN government bonds dropped as the Bundesbank said it would stick to its
restrictive policies to try to bring inflation under control and left
interest rates unchanged. Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president,
said there was no room for an easing in interest rates, and the central bank
left its discount rate at 8.25 per cent while its Lombard rate remained at
9.5 per cent.
The Bundesbank added its money supply target for 1993 would be raised to a
range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent, from 3.5 to 5.5 per cent. The bund market had
expected the money supply target range to be raised.
Mr Otmar Issing, Bundesbank board member, said German M3 money supply growth
slowed in November, and was quoted as saying it would be below 10 per cent.
The provisional figure of 10.2 per cent for annualised growth for October
was revised to 10.3 per cent. The Liffe bund futures contract fell from a
high of 91.74 to 91.40 on the Bundesbank's statements, ending the day at
around 91.45.
THE Dutch and Belgian central banks cut their key interest rates yesterday,
but the moves were a reflection of their relative currency strength against
the D-Mark rather than an indication of monetary policy.
The Dutch central bank cut two of its three key official interest rates by
25 basis points while the special advances rate, the main money market rate,
was cut to 8.60 per cent from 8.70 per cent.
Dutch government bonds edged lower with the market focusing on the
possibility of a new state bond issue in the 10 or 15-year area expected to
be launched shortly.
FRENCH government bonds fell on disappointment at the Bundesbank's decision
to leave interest rates unchanged and as the French franc came under renewed
pressure in the foreign exchange market.
The decision by Norway to sever the Norwegian krone's link to the Ecu
yesterday put pressure on the weaker members of the European exchange rate
mechanism. Dealers said they believed the Bank of France was forced to
intervene in order to support the franc. The yield on the 8 1/2 per cent
bond due 2002 moved from 8.20 per cent to 8.17 per cent.
UK government bonds dropped half a point at the long end, dragged down by
the a fall in the European bond markets, sterling weakness and
disappointment over yesterday's Treasury report. The Liffe gilt future
contract slipped from 99.25 to 99.06 in relatively thin volume, while in the
cash market the 9 3/4 per cent gilt due 2002 dropped from 109 1/32 to 108
19/32 .
Dealers noted some profit-taking at the long end following the lengthening
trades seen recently. Gilt prices ended lower across the curve after the
Bundesbank indicated there was no room for a cut in German interest rates.
JAPANESE government bonds closed firmer after the benchmark cash bond
reached a new high for the year. The yield on the No 145 moved from 4.59 per
cent to 4.57 per cent before backtracking to end at 4.58 per cent. March
bond futures ended at 107.86 against Wednesday's close of 107.84, and traded
in a range of 107.78-107.92.
LONGER-dated US Treasuries firmed on good inflation news yesterday, although
prices at the short end of the market remained flat. In late trading, the
benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 102 7/16 , yielding 7.415
per cent. The two-year note was slightly weaker, down 3/32 at 99 15/16 ,
yielding 4.641 per cent.
The eagerly-awaited inflation data was better than anticipated, with the
November producer price index falling 0.2 per cent, compared with an
expected 0.1 per cent rise. The news cheered the long end of the market,
which is traditionally sensitive to inflation fears.
The short end of the market failed to post any gains, partly because of the
presence in the market of a large seller of two-year notes. Shorter-dated
paper was also troubled by news of a 38,000 decline in jobless claims during
the last week of November.

as share prices tumble

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG'S largest flotation since mid-1990, the public offer of shares in
National Mutual Asia (NMA), has been only 50 per cent subscribed as a result
of the collapsing share prices that have accompanied the Sino-British war of
words over the development of democracy in the colony.
Underwriters were left with more than HKDollars 300m (USDollars 38.9m) worth
of shares - believed to be the worst under-subscription for a new issue in
Hong Kong's history, far exceeding underwriting obligations for the poorly
received Sime Darby flotation, in late 1985.
The row between Britain and China over Hong Kong governor Mr Chris Patten's
political reform proposals had already resulted in the withdrawal of the
HKDollars 300m flotation of South China Brokerage.
NMA, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Australian life assurance and
investment group, was to raise HKDollars 1.08bn, through a placement and
open offer. The HKDollars 431m placement was almost 10 times
over-subscribed, but demand for the public offer vanished in the wake of
last week's 12 per cent drop in the Hang Seng Index.
Provisional estimates last night indicated the HKDollars 646m public offer
was 50 per cent subscribed. The offer was fully underwritten, with Standard
Chartered Asia acting as lead manager, and Baring Brothers, Morgan Stanley,
Daiwa Securities and S. G. Warburg Securities as co-underwriters.
Brokers were not surprised at the response. The research director of one
local securities house said: 'There was strong initial support for the issue
and the over-subscription for the placement was sufficient to cover the
whole flotation. But given the current uncertainty, the shares are bound to
perform badly at the start'.
The underwriting agreement contained a force majeure clause, whereby it was
possible for the underwriters to terminate the deal, claiming an extreme and
unforeseeable change in circumstances. But at the time the offer opened,
Standard Chartered said it was confident the flotation would be well
received.

THE recent sequence of securitised bond issues continued in the
international markets yesterday with the launch by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew of a
Pounds 180m issue for Truck Funding, a subsidiary of Leyland Daf Finance.
UBS P&amp;D said the issue, for the UK financing arm of Daf, was the UK's first
securitisation of tax-based leases. The notes are backed by vehicle leasing
contracts from the Leyland Daf truck and van business in the UK.
UBS P&amp;D said the structure represented a lower cost alternative to bank
financing, at a time when the leasing and finance sector was finding
medium-term bank financing harder to come by. Similar deals from other
issuers are expected to follow, the bank said, although one current problem
with leasing transactions was the absence of taxable profits against which
to offset capital allowances.
The issue, of Pounds 180m of five-year floating rates paying a margin of 50
basis points over three-month Libor at a fixed reoffer price of 99.65,
offers a discounted margin to investors of 60 basis points. Proceeds will be
used to replace more expensive short-term bank facilities.
UBS P&amp;D claims to have solved the main problem of securitising UK tax-based
leasing deals. These centre on the loss of capital allowances by the
originator of a lease, in this case Leyland Daf Finance, if it transfers the
underlying asset.
'This structure preserves the capital allowance position of the originator,'
said Mr Mark Lewis, a vice-president at UBS P&amp;D responsible for structuring
the transaction. 'All the tax benefits stay with it.'
The assets and receivables are stripped away from Leyland Daf Finance in a
tax neutral way, he said. The receivables and assets are first sold by
Leyland Daf Finance to a special purpose vehicle. This then sells the
receivables on to one company - Truck Funding - and the assets to another.
Credit enhancement enabling the issue to qualify for its Standard &amp; Poor's
triple-A rating comes in two stages. First, each Pounds 100 of bonds is
backed by Pounds 106 of assets.
Second, in the event of a shortfall, Union Bank of Switzerland guarantees to
lend Pounds 25m to Pounds 30m on a non-recourse basis to Truck Funding, to
be placed on deposit until needed to meet any arrears and losses. Repayment
of the loan is subordinated to the claims of the noteholders.
If UBS loses its triple-A rating, the loan will immediately be drawn down in
full and proceeds put on deposit with an appropriately rated bank. The issue
was well received with only minor carping, focusing on the absence of a
rating by Moody's Investors Service.
Swiss Re launched a Dollars 150m seven-year bond with callable five-year
warrants, exerciseable into equity in MGIC Investment Corp of the US. The
warrants are callable at any time, on 30 days' notice, in years four and
five, to help increase the probability of exercise, said Goldman Sachs, the
arranger.

NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday opened its first Italian branch, 24
hours after spending L185bn (Dollars 133m) on a hotel chain in precisely the
kind of 'structured' transaction in which the new Italian operation is to
specialise.
The new branch, bought from Continental Bank of the US, will be part of the
operations of NatWest Markets, the bank's corporate and investment banking
arm. NatWest's retail banking operations are already represented in Italy
through a 19 per cent stake in Creditwest, a small bank majority-owned by
Credito Italiano.
The new Italian operation will mirror NatWest Markets in combining
traditional lending to big companies and banks with a variety of corporate
finance and treasury skills. Its target customers will be Italy's 200
biggest banks and companies. The new office, which received branch status
from the Bank of Italy in October, will not affect NatWest's participation
in Creditwest.
Mr Martin Owen, chief executive of NatWest Markets and a board member of the
parent company, confirmed this week's purchase of 15 hotels from
AgipPetroli, which has set up a joint venture with the Forte hotels group,
was part of a wider deal.

MERCEDES-Benz do Brasil, part of the German motor group, will this year
report its first loss in Brazil.
Mr Rolf Eckrodt, president of Benz do Brasil, blamed persistent high
inflation and deepening recession for a Dollars 300m drop in sales.
In spite of record exports, truck production was the lowest since 1970,
dropping to 14,200 units compared with 22,400 in 1991.
To compensate for falling domestic sales, the company focused strongly on
exports, achieving a 31 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 600m, more
than one-third of which was accounted for by Mexico.
Total sales slipped to Dollars 1.4bn and as a result the company plans to
lay off 2,000 workers next month.
The news of the losses - the first in 36 years - concludes a bad year for
Benz do Brasil, which is one of the companies implicated in the corruption
scandal that recently led to the suspension of President Fernando Collor.
Nestle, the Swiss foods group, is to cut investments in Brazil because of
falling sales and profitability. Investments are to be reduced from Dollars
105m to Dollars 60m as sales slide.

MERCEDES Benz do Brasil, part of the German motor group, will this year
report its first loss in Brazil.
Mr Rolf Eckrodt, president of Benz do Brasil, blamed persistent high
inflation and deepening recession for a Dollars 300m drop in sales.
In spite of record exports, truck production was the lowest since 1970,
dropping to 14,200 units compared with 22,400 in 1991. Bus production rose
slightly to 20,000. Mercedes has 83 per cent of the local bus market.
To compensate for falling domestic sales, the company focused strongly on
exports, achieving a 31 per cent increase in sales to Dollars 600m, more
than one-third of which was accounted for by Mexico.
Total sales slipped to Dollars 1.4bn and as a result the company plans to

Benz do Brasil, which is one of the companies implicated in the corruption
scandal that recently led to the suspension of President Fernando Collor.
Nestle, the Swiss foods group, is to cut investments in Brazil because of
falling sales and profitability. Investments are to be reduced from Dollars
105m to Dollars 60m as sales continue to be hit by Brazil's declining per
capita income. Like many companies in Brazil, Nestle has tried to compensate
through boosting exports which this year rose 50 per cent to Dollars 50m,
largely to Argentina.
