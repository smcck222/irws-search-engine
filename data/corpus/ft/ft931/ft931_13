FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Fire safety laws set for review
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS have ordered a review of Britain's 20-year-old fire safety
legislation, the Home Office confirmed last night.
The review will look at the issue of crown immunity, by which government and
royal buildings are exempt from prosecution even if fire precautions are
inadequate. Officials were unable to say when the review might end.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major plays down Scots water row
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prime minister has insisted that no decision has been reached about
whether Scottish water should be privatised. On Tuesday, Mr Major sparked
opposition anger when he appeared to indicate that privatisation would go
ahead, telling MPs: 'I have no reason to doubt that water privatisation in
Scotland will be effective and efficient, as elsewhere.'
But in an interview in today's Scotsman newspaper, Mr Major says this should
have been qualified by a rider saying 'if implemented'.
He said: 'We are in the middle of a consultation period. We will finish the
consultation period. We will make a decision; it will take account of the
special Scottish dimension. That has always been the position.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs told of fault in Trident
submarine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S latest Pounds 650m Trident missile submarine lost a crucial part
of its defensive sonar equipment during sea trials, MPs were told yesterday,
David White writes.
The Commons defence committee also heard that delays in the command system
software meant the submarine could not fire torpedoes. But it was told the
system, designed by BAeSema, a joint venture between British Aerospace and
the Anglo-French Sema group, would be ready by the time the vessel was
deployed.
HMS Vanguard, the first of four Trident submarines, is due to enter service
in late 1994 or early 1995.
Rear Admiral Richard Irwin, chief of the strategic systems executive, said
part of the sonar 'towed array' trailing from the stern of the submarine
broke away in the early stages of contractor sea trials, between October and
January.
The towed array, costing about Pounds 250,000, is part of the Sonar 2054
system provided by GEC-Marconi.

BRITAIN yesterday decided to pull back to the UK a contingent of about 300
Army personnel which has been with the naval task force in the Adriatic
since January.
However, the Ministry of Defence said that the soldiers, sent out as standby
reinforcements for British troops serving with the UN in Bosnia, would be
ready to return at short notice.
Their equipment, including six 105mm light artillery guns and locating
radars, will remain aboard the auxiliary vessel Argus in the Adriatic.

THE 16,500-acre Knoydart estate in the west Highlands of Scotland has been

FT  11 MAR 93 / Fed presidents called to account by senators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE regional presidents of the US Federal Reserve should be made more
directly accountable to the public, Mr Donald Riegle, Democratic chairman of
the Senate banking committee, said yesterday.
He delivered his recommendation directly to the 12 regional presidents who
were summoned to Washington yesterday to testify before the committee. The
presidents have never before been required to testify en masse before the
committee.
Following the election of President Bill Clinton, said Mr Riegle, the nation
was expecting 'more accountability from everybody'.
He told the regional presidents he wanted to see more constructive teamwork
on fiscal and monetary policy and would call them back to testify again in
about six months.
The presidents gave an upbeat assessment of economic prospects, predicting
that growth would be 3 per cent or more this year.
They declined, however, to respond to suggestions from the committee that
the contractionary impact of the deficit reduction package might need to be
offset by a more expansionary monetary policy.
Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, warned that long-term
rates might go up if the final deficit reduction package fell short of
expectations in financial markets.
The hearing was part of a campaign by Democratic members of Congress to
increase their leverage over the regional presidents, who hold five of the
12 votes on the Federal Open Market Committee, the body that sets the level
of short-term interest rates. The Fed's Washington-based board of governors
hold the other seven votes.
Many Democrats dislike the fact that regional presidents are elected by
private sector boards and thus escape direct scrutiny by Congress. Fed
governors, by contrast, are appointed by the White House and subject to
confirmation by the Senate.
Mr Riegle is co-sponsor of a bill introduced this year that would rescind
the right of regional presidents to vote on monetary policy.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Health hearings 'in public' ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton seemed unperturbed yesterday at a federal judge's
ruling that obliges the task force on US healthcare reform, run by his wife,
to conduct some meetings in public, reports Jurek Martin in Washington.
Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton's team was deemed subject to a 1972 law on
federal advisory committees that 'information gathering' meetings be open to
the public. But sessions for drawing up recommendations and advice to the
president were not made subject to public scrutiny.
Mr Clinton said this was 'a very good ruling' because it preserved a
necessary degree of privacy.
The action had been brought by three groups, including a doctors'
association created to fight national healthcare. Interest in the case had
mostly arisen from the extent to which Mrs Clinton, a power in this
administration though not on the payroll, would be compelled to operate in
public.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Close vote likely on Poland's big sell-off scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLAND'S coalition government is hoping that its wafer thin parliamentary
majority will hold in next week's vote on the country's controversial mass
privatisation scheme.
The scheme envisages the transfer of 600 state enterprises to
foreign-managed investment funds, with shares in the funds handed out at a
nominal fee to the population. The plan seeks at one blow to widen share
ownership, reduce the state sector, streamline enterprise management and
improve the ability of the companies to raise investment funds.
Over 50 foreign investment banks and consultants, including Kidder Peabody
and Kleinwort Benson, have offered to run the 20 or more funds. These will
exist for 10 years. After then the shareholders can decide whether to
liquidate the funds.
Parliament has been working on the draft legislation since last autumn. A
debate last week revealed doubts among both the opposition left and
government supporters from the nationalist ZChN party.
Government officials fear opponents could remove some of the plan's key
elements. Several ZChN deputies have threatened to vote against the plan
unless foreign managers are excluded from the scheme. Meanwhile the SLD
group, encompassing the former communists, approves of the use of foreign
managers but wants to limit the scheme to a pilot project encompassing only
200 plants. The SLD also argues that the shares should not be distributed
until 1995 after the funds' initial performance has been reviewed.
The World Bank is linking approval of successive tranches of a projected
Dollars 450m structural adjustment loan designed to finance a domestic bank
debt reduction plan to the scheme being implemented by parliament.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (24): And the moral
of the story is .. - Project Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVIEW of project management packages in this issue of Software At Work
looked at a dozen or so packages, interviewing several users of each. Most
of the stories are to do with the management of an event of some sort -
either one-off, like the planning of an exhibition, or an event likely to be
repeated at different times in different places. Predictably, all users
faced the same problem: the scheduling of resources to bring projects in on
time and within budget.
It was surprising to discover the wide range of uses to which project
management systems are put, many of them well outside the traditional uses
of construction and IT projects.
At the design house Frank Usher, which creates and manufactures ladies' wear
for special occasions (pages 8-9), a project management system was used in a
truly one-off, haute couture style. The traditional tools of Gantt charts
and resource scheduling were used for analysis and presentation, to persuade
the design team that they had to change their ways to cut down overheads.
At the other end of the scale, project management (PM) is used day in, day
out at BT, to monitor the progress of an enormous number of jobs, as many as
15,000 jobs, of 250 different sorts, covering 2,000 locations, (pages
12-13). BT is attempting to improve its efficiency and bring down costs by
standardising on a project management system.
Rockwell Graphics, a manufacturer of printing presses, has a PM system now
used to solve a similar long-distance problem, when commissioning presses
all over the world.
Over dozens of interviews, one comment was made over and again: the expense
comes up front, and very often there is a long gap between the initial
investment in training, and any discernible benefits. On the other hand, as
was discovered by Britannia Airlines, (page 4), the benefits are
far-reaching. Procedures and work practices developed during a project can
have far-reaching effects which reward the initial effort in unforeseen
ways.
Because PM often affects the way a company works, it needs top-level
ownership and interest. If the person at the top won't make a decision, it
doesn't matter if you have the best PM system in the world. Likewise, if
no-one has established at the very start just what it is you are trying to
achieve, then results will be minimal.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (23): Economical
entry into EDI - How even the smallest companies can benefit from new
technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE CHEAPEST way into electronic data interchange costs just 90p
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
that is the cost of getting a message through the Post Office's Edipost
service, launched last October.
True, the message goes by post - but the service enables even the smallest
of companies to meet their customers' demands for electronic trading,
without the set-up and running charges and without even having a computer.
With Edipost, a DEC Vax computer run by the Post Office is attached to the
various EDI services and receives orders and other messages sent
electronically from EDI-users to their suppliers. These are printed and
posted to Edipost customers by first-class mail.
The EDI user benefits because its messages are transmitted to another EDI
user - the Post Office - so the advantages of EDI still apply.
Each message costs 90p for up to 100 messages a day. The rate goes down to
40p for several thousand messages. The costs are typically paid by the big
EDI user and it is then up to that company to decide whether to charge its
suppliers.
However, a small company run by a former tomato grower in Norfolk has gone
two steps further. Meadowhouse Bar-Laser in Stalham has been running a
two-way postal EDI service for nearly a year and has more than 200 users.
Here, too, a Meadowhouse computer is linked to EDI services on behalf of its
customers. The company uses personal computers. Messages are received from
EDI users and forwarded by post, fax or courier. But Meadowhouse users can
also send messages to their customers through the service. They can send
information such as acknowledgement and stock details back to Meadowhouse,
which enters the data to the EDI service.
MEADOWHOUSE aims its bureau EDI service both at small firms and at suppliers
of highly seasonal products, which for example might only trade with a big
retail company for very short periods.
Managing director Mr Norman Ashton is reluctant to give sample prices. He
says charges depend on negotiations with the main partner in the EDI chain,
typically a big retail group, and on the level of delivery, printing and
other services required.
The bureau service has evolved from Meadowhouse's initial EDI business, set
up in 1986. This has been built round a program package which translates
received EDI messages not only into data for entry into business systems but
also into printed working documents such as barcode labels and despatch
notes.
The package is sold to EDI users and can also be run as part of the bureau
service. Prices start at around Pounds 1,500 for the first year and Pounds
800 for the second year, but this includes connection to an EDI service and
all data transmission. These prices are based on a personal computer linked
to the IBM EDI service.
This whole business was created by accident but has taken off in the last
three years, with 43 per cent growth last year to a turnover of Pounds 2.3m,
40 staff and over 1,000 package modules sold.
It was set up by Mr John Pennell, a tomato grower and now technical
director. 'He got a computer for his business and got hooked,' says Mr
Ashton. 'One day he was talking to friend who was working on producing
barcode labels from EDI data for BHS and felt he could do it better.'
Mr Pennell now leases his greenhouses to an organic farmer and works
full-time for Meadowhouse.
'Software and EDI service companies have focused on producing software which
converts EDI messages to update business data files,' says Norman Ashton.
'But small companies typically only want printed orders. So we set out to
enable small and medium-sized companies to put the EDI data to instant
business use.'
Unidoor International is a prime example of such a company. It imports
leisure-wear sold by high-street retail chains under their own labels. The
company, based in Dunstable, Kent, was no newcomer to computing, already
running a management system on a Mips computer. But on the product despatch
side it was 'drowning in a sea of paper', according to financial director Mr
Jerry Phillips.
'Each delivery means producing masses of labels showing product information,
the number in each box and so on, for every box,' Mr Phillips says. 'Each
delivery could mean 1,000 labels - and we were producing all this by hand.
We had 30 people working all day every day and over weekends just to produce
these labels. When Meadowhouse brought their package to show us, we wouldn't
let them take it away]'
Unidoor International now runs the Meadowhouse package and EDI on a Novell
personal computer network. This includes a laser printer which produces
barcodes as well as all the product labels.
Personal computer links are normally the cheapest EDI option for a computer
user wishing to connect its machine. The leading service providers typically
base their connection charges on the size of the user's computer. From its
entry into EDI as a data recipient last year, Unidoor International has
quickly moved on to gathering information on sales and stocks from some of
its customers and is looking at sending back invoices - 'EDI has not only
saved us from drowning but also, through the information exchange with our
customers, given us closer insight into what is selling,' says Jerry
Phillips. 'Through EDI, we've become true partners with our customers.'
Unidoor has no links between PC network and the Mips and Mr Phillips says
this means there is some duplication and rekeying of information.
Direct Home Entertainment, which sells a million videos, CDs and computer
games a year through catalogue shopping companies, has made such a link and
as a result has cut despatch time from a fortnight or more to 48 hours.
Previously, orders were received by post.
This company, with offices in London and a warehouse in Coventry, runs its
EDI link on a personal computer which is connected in turn to its Nokia
business computer system. It, too, uses the Meadow-house package to link to
EDI services and to produce labels.
'The leisure business is growing very quickly and the number of units we
despatch has doubled over the last two years,' says managing director Mr
Jerry Donahue. 'EDI has helped tremendously to handle this growth.'
After the relatively low-cost entry into EDI through a personal computer
link, Direct Home Entertainment, too, has quickly expanded its use. It is
planning to report back via EDI to the catalogue companies on unfilled
orders, so that customers can be informed as soon as possible. Previously,
such orders stayed on the company's system until they could be met.
Another personal computer EDI-user, sweets manufacturer Needlers, has gone
still further with its links. This company, with a Pounds 20m turnover and
based in Hull, again used the cheap option of a personal computer link to
get into EDI. Computer manager Mr Neil Dean says that, like other companies,
Needlers was 'pretty strongly encouraged' into EDI by Tesco, a big customer
committed to electronic trading, (see pages 15-16).
Meanwhile, Needlers was running its financial, manufacturing and
distribution software on an IBM AS/400 minicomputer using the Business 400
package from JBA.
'We were printing orders received by EDI into the PC and then keying the
information into the AS/400,' Mr Neal says. 'This was OK for one customer's
orders but we could see others going this way and manual keying would be out
of the question for 20 or 30 lots of orders.
'In addition it would not have been economic to upgrade the PC software
package to handle links to different services every time we added an
electronic trading partner.'
Needlers therefore went back to its business software supplier, JBA, and
added the company's EDI software module to its package. This was a
considerable investment: this module alone starts at Pounds 4,500, depending
on the computer size; in addition the Tradanet EDI service used by Tesco
charges more for links from machines bigger than a PC.
Needlers now links directly into EDI services from the AS/400, with the JBA
software handling the transfer of trading data from the services into the
main database.
This enhancement happened last autumn - and the investment has proved
worthwhile. Since then, Needlers has gone live on EDI with five retail
chains and expects to be up to 20 by the end of the year. Mr Neal hopes to
move to EDI with suppliers but Needlers does not have the resources to
handle this at present as it concentrates on establishing links with its
customers.
All these EDI users and suppliers illustrate the different ways that small
and medium-sized concerns - even one-man bands - can move into EDI. As Jerry
Phillips at Unidoor International puts it: 'These days it makes no sense for
anyone of any size not to go to EDI.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software At Work, Spring 1993 (22): A boon for
small businesses - Electrical appliance suppliers are subsidising EDI for
their service agents - to both sides' benefit / EDI Joint Venture -
Manufacturers and service companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING manufacturers of small electrical appliances have spent thousands of
pounds to develop an electronic data interchange software package that they
will never use.
Yet they are delighted with the system, because it is bringing hundreds of
tiny service firms into EDI and eliminating all the paperwork that goes with
handling orders and deliveries of components and paying for repairs.
The manufacturers - Braun, Dimplex, Moulinex Swan Krupps and Tefal and
Rowenta - have worked together through the Small Electrical Manufacturers
Association to develop a software package which handles stock control and
job-costing for the service firms, as well as links to an EDI network. The
software can also connect to popular accounting packages such as Sage and
Pegasus.
The manufacturers have set up an EDI service called EASAS - Electrical
Appliance Service Agents System - which runs on the British Telecom EDI
network, but is managed by themselves. The day-to-day running of the service
is contracted to a software company, Perwill Group, which also worked on the
software, but the appliance manufacturers control the strategy and
development of the EDI system and the package.
The service agents pay just Pounds 90 for the software package and Pounds 30
a month to use EASAS, plus telephone charges.
The price has been kept so low because the industry is made up of hundreds
of tiny firms. Some work from market stalls and are sending EDI messages
through a personal computer at the back of their pitch - 'for Pounds 90, the
service agents get a full-blown business and EDI package,' says Mr Nigel
Eastham, who runs EASAS at Perwill. 'This will never cover the development
and enhancement costs but the manufacturers nonetheless see their investment
as worthwhile because of the efficiency that EDI is bringing.'
This is confirmed by Mr Karl Uggerholt, finance director at Braun: 'We
receive a mountain of paperwork from the hundreds of agents we deal with.
EASAS is drastically reducing that mountain.'
Manufacturers have traditionally received orders for parts by post. This
means opening and sorting letters and keying information into a computer
system. With EDI, information is prepared only once - by the service agent -
and can be in a manufacturer's system within minutes of a customer coming
through the agent's door with a broken kettle or electric shaver. The spare
parts can be sent the same day.
'We can already manage claims much more quickly and efficiently, resulting
in better service to our agents, which in turn has a beneficial effect for
the customer,' says Mr Uggerholt at Braun.
The agents also benefit from other aspects of the software. They can enter a
product model number and the system lists all the parts. They can look up
prices and give a customer an instant quotation for a repair.
Nigel Eastham at Perwill says EASAS is a good example of a commercial
community totally controlling EDI in its own sector.
'Every manufacturer has one vote and all development is equally shared, so a
big company can't control things,' he says.
'The agents deal with several manufacturers, so their system has to be able
to accommodate different companies' payment methods and rates. If one
manufacturer ran it, that company could control the development and gear the
system to its own way of operating.'
The EASAS committee consists only of manufacturers. Mr Eastham says service
agents might be represented some time in the future but points out that they
talk to Perwill, their system support company, about suggested changes to
the software, and the company puts these requests to the committee.
'The manufacturers want to accommodate the agents as much as possible,
because they want as many agents as possible on the EDI system,' he says.
Individual manufacturers could work on their own with EDI services and
insist that their agents join those services, as has happened in other
industries. But this would be prohibitively expensive for the very small
service firms.
Nigel Eastham says the service agents are under no pressure to join EASAS.
EASAS running costs are kept down by the community arrangement. British
Telecom sends one invoice to EASAS and Perwill sorts out individual invoices
for all the companies connected and chases payment when necessary. Perwill
also provides support - a considerable task.
'About 90 per cent of the agents are new to computing,' Nigel Eastham says.
'We spend an extreme amount of time answering their questions before they
join - and once a firm is on the system we typically get three or four calls
a day for the first two or three weeks.'
BT's EDI network service was chosen because EASAS felt the company had
developed the service well over the last year and was ready to offer 'very
good basic terms and very reasonable running costs', says Mr Eastham.
EASAS has been running since June 1992 and all the parties now want more
companies to join.
Eventually, the number of manufacturers could go from the original four to
around two-dozen. This would spread the funding burden.
There are now 30 service agents connected and the potential is over 400.
Agents typically work for between half-a-dozen and 20 manufacturers.
Perwill managing director Mr Bill Pugsley concludes: 'EASAS has brought
rival companies together to use the business benefits of EDI - not as an
individual competitive weapon - but to improve service levels all round.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (21): Freight
forwarders make a smart mov - EDI Is vital for securing the industry's
future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is no future for the freight forwarding industry without electronic
data interchange (EDI). So says Mr Jim White, director-general of the
British International Freight Association (BIFA), which in February set up a
company to run an EDI service not only for its member-companies but also for
those companies' customers, couriers and hauliers.
For Pounds 400, companies can join a service which automates the production
and transmission of documents between the sender, the freight forwarder,
carriers and recipients and also sends the required information to HM
Customs, writes John Kavanagh.
'Without EDI, a trader typically creates a despatch document on its computer
and sends it by fax or post to its freight forwarder,' says Mr White. 'The
forwarder then produces its own documents for one or more carriers, which in
turn create further documents of their own.'
'With EDI, the trader sends the despatch instructions to the freight
forwarder through the EDI system. The forwarder just adds a line or two of
instructions and sends the information on through the system to the
carriers. He can also send a note by EDI to the recipient.
'In addition, BIFA has become the first organisation to send the required
statistical information to Customs and Excise using the X4 00 message
standard.'
He adds: 'The beauty is that everything is based on the original EDI
document from the trader. There is no re-keying of the same information at
every stage in the chain.'
EDI in the freight forwarding business has been led by BIFA, initially to
protect the very survival of its member-companies - 'traders are looking for
high-quality services and, especially, at extending the just-in-time
techniques they have adopted in manufacturing to their freight operations,'
he says.
'This means the freight forwarding business has had to become more
sophisticated. Without EDI there is no future for our industry, because if
we're not in the EDI chain, traders could cut us out and talk directly to
the carriers.'
Instead, BIFA has taken the initiative by setting up Bifanet, a company
which runs an EDI service for communication of instructions and other
information from one end of the despatch and delivery chain to the other.
Bifanet's trump card is its Pounds 400 fee, a rock-bottom bargain rate for
joining the service. The Pounds 400 also covers an EDI software package and
use of electronic mail and bulletin board systems as well as EDI.
The benefit of the low fee is that it is already attracting the freight
forwarding companies' customers and haulage firms to the network.
Companies used to paying several thousand pounds for EDI links to their
customers and raw materials suppliers are happy to pay Pounds 400 for a
service which makes for more efficient national and international shipping.
The software package was introduced six months a go and already more than
200 companies and haulage firms have signed up, in addition to 50 freight
forwarders. Another 40 BIFA members are now being connected.
FREIGHT forwarders have been inhibited from joining EDI services because of
the high entry costs, Jim White says - 'half the BIFA members have 10 staff
or less. We are offering them a low-cost entry with a simple software
package which runs on a personal computer.' The success of the EDI
initiative has led to the formation of Bifanet.
'The growth has put a strain on BIFA resources, so we are setting up Bifanet
as a company dedicated to the EDI service,' he says.
BIFA has put up Pounds 50,000 to get the company started and it is looking
for share subscriptions totalling Pounds 800,000 from its members.
Bifanet is being built around Emelco, a small software company which
developed the EDI software. It is starting with eight people and expects to
grow to 16 staff within two years. Bifanet will maintain and develop the
software package, provide EDI consultancy and training - and market the
package world-wide.
'The UK is a year ahead of other countries on EDI in this field,' Mr White
says. 'Our software is based on the Edifact international standard for EDI
messages. Our network supplier, GEIS, has a world-wide operation and
recently signed an agreement with the international freight forwarders
federation, FIATA, to promote EDI. The UK is therefore well placed to be the
world leader: indeed, five other countries are already looking at what we
are doing and are evaluating the software.'
Bifanet is able to keep the price of EDI so low because it is running the
service for subscribers, rather than the network company, GEIS. Bifanet
negotiated special rates by taking on all the billing and support for the
service. GEIS sends Bifanet one detailed invoice - by EDI, naturally - and
Bifanet produces individual invoices for all the subscribers.
Mr White says GEIS was chosen because it had an established worldwide EDI
and electronic mail network and was already involved with the freight
industry.
Subscribers can also use the GEIS electronic mail and bulletin board
services - 'electronic mail is a painless way into EDI for very small
companies,' says Mr White. 'They can get going immediately and graduate to
EDI when they are confident. After all, electronic mail simply replaces the
fax and the phone, whereas EDI can change the very way you do business.'
The bulletin board system is in effect an extension of electronic mail,
allowing users to leave messages for anyone who cares to link in. BIFA and
Bifanet will use it to broadcast details of training courses, information on
the single European market and so on. Mr White suggests individual freight
forwarders could set up private bulletin boards for their customers.
But the prime aim of Bifanet is to make trade more efficient - 'there is
estimated to be Pounds 50bn of freight sitting in warehouses worldwide,' he
says. 'EDI can make a big impact on that inventory.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (19): Banks slower
to catch on - Applications debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSIDERING banks have always been among the leading exploiters of
computing, they have come quite late into electronic data interchange (EDI).
While the likes of Tesco were starting to trade electronically in 1987, the
first EDI banking services were not launched until Barclays and National
Westminster entered the market in 1990.
This business is growing rather slowly, not least because some of the early
users of EDI, notably retail chains, are balking at the cost. One suggestion
is that the turmoil in the banking market in recent years has made the banks
desperate to find new ways to make profit and they see EDI as a golden
opportunity.
Tesco director Mr Dave MacInnis sums up the view of many business customers:
'The whole idea of paperless trading through EDI is that it cuts
administrative costs. Yet these bank services want to charge four times what
it costs to process a cheque.
'We regard that as excessive and we are somewhat in dispute with the banks.
It's a shame, because we have electronic trading throughout the business
chain but at the end of the process we still have to produce a piece of
paper, a cheque.'
A measure of the gap between the retail chains and the banks is the reply
from Mr Saif Rahman, business development manager at National Westminster
responsible for EDI services: 'Four times the cheque-processing cost? I say
that is very cheap, considering the services we are offering.'
NatWest's Bankline Interchange service was developed on an IBM AS/400
computer by Terence Chapman Associates, a London consultancy and systems
house, at a cost of Pounds 1.8m. The system is linked to all the main UK EDI
services, run by INS, AT&amp;T-Istel, IBM and British Telecom, so that companies
exchanging orders and invoices by EDI can complete the trading circle by
making payments and notifying the recipients electronically, too.
The service offers prompt payment, the provision of information such as
remittance advices to recipients and facilities such as the ability to sign
off batches of payments but assign different settlement dates to each item.
Saif Rahman says the service combines the good points of the BACS national
payments clearing service and of traditional cheques.
'We offer the speed of BACS and the control and information provided by
cheques,' he says.
'BACS is not the system for complex payments: the amount of information you
can provide is limited, so you can't include details such as discounts,
invoice numbers and so on.
'If you send magnetic tapes of payment details by courier to BACS, you get
an acknowledgement by post, so there is some time before you know the
transactions have been received and are being processed.
'With an EDI service, the network itself confirms the time it received a
message and the time it was looked at by the recipient.'
Saif Rahman's views on BACS are backed by Food Brokers, a middleman between
the grocery and pharmaceutical trades and retail groups, including Tesco.
'We've tended to shy away from BACS, even though it gives us cleared funds,
because we lose a bit of control,' says Mr Duncan Knight, Food Brokers'
administration manager. 'We actually prefer to collect payment ourselves and
key in the information in the way we want.
'Our payment terms are 30 days, so if a cheque hasn't arrived after that
time, we can chase it the next day. If payments are made by BACS, it can be
two or three days after the customer has sent the tape to BACS before you
know whether you've been paid.
'You have to check with the bank and they have to make their own checks, so
you're backwards and forwards with phone calls.'
Saif Rahman at NatWest says the main benefits of bank EDI services are
prompt payment, which enables companies to negotiate discounts with their
suppliers, and control and efficiency through the information provided by
the service.
HE believes the discounts argument is one reason why retail chains in
particular have not rushed to sign up for the services: the huge numbers of
low-value items passing very quickly through supermarkets already enable big
retailers to negotiate good discounts.
Even so, he believes the likes of Tesco are wrong in comparing the cost of a
BACS payment or of a cheque and a postage stamp with the cost of a bank EDI
service.
'The banks charge roughly Pounds 1 for a payment and a remittance advice
with their EDI services,' Mr Rahman says. 'Research by the Inter-Bank
Research Organisation and others shows that the cost of producing a cheque
and sending it with a remittance advice starts at Pounds 1.60.
'It's not just an 18p stamp - there's a time-cost, the cost of the cheques,
probably specially printed with the company logo, the cost of keeping the
cheques secure . . . and so on.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (20): Customers
welcome EDI plan - Utility application / Invoicing services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM has started sending selected customers their telephone bills
by electronic data interchange (EDI), writes John Kavanagh.
It is just one of many public utilities looking at cutting costs for itself
and its customers by using EDI to send detailed invoices for services.
Tesco, for example, is talking to BT, gas and electricity supply companies
and local authorities about this extension to its use of EDI. It expects to
forge at least one such link this year.
BT has been testing the idea with computer market leader IBM since initial
negotiations in 1990. Both companies run EDI services and are also heavy
users. They worked together to develop a summary invoice based on the
international Edifact format standards for EDI messages. There is already a
link between their EDI networks, so the data could be passed from BT's
billing system into its EDI network, across to IBM's service and into its
accounting systems.
'As a recipient of 34,000 BT bills totalling Pounds 14m a year, IBM was a
natural partner in this project,' says Mr Andrew Cottam, one of the project
managers on the BT side. 'We already had a working partnership with IBM
through its involvement in our OneBill service, which provides consolidated
bill information.
'With big customers, typically a van dumps a load of paper printed with all
the billing information and a team of people key it into a computer system
for accounting purposes.'
IBM reports 'significant improvements' from the EDI link. An entire month's
OneBill data is now fed directly into its computer system in 30 seconds:
previously it took a fortnight to have all the information keyed-in.
In one test, an entire year's data was transmitted in 8.5 minutes, saving 27
per cent of one staff member's time.
BT is now verifying IBM's findings in trials with a dozen customers and
expects to launch the service nationally this year.
'There was great demand from other customers to join the trial,' says Andrew
Cottam. 'We produce 400,000 telephone bills and 250,000 reminders every day.
And companies are increasingly recognising that these bills are an important
source of information on their use of voice and data networks and other
services.
'This also has implications for us: customers want bills that are easily
understood and can be incorporated into financial planning systems to help
monitor and control costs.'
BT has yet to decide on charges for this service - or whether to charge at
all.
'It's saving customers considerable time and money by eliminating data entry
 -and it's also saving us money,' says Andrew Cottam says. 'We don't know
what we'll charge - if anything.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (18): Early fears
give way to enthusiasm - A long-established family business in Scotland
discovers the benefits of trading electronically / Case study of Product
supplier - Thomas Tunnock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAKER and confectionery manufacturer Thomas Tunnock says it was pushed into
electronic data interchange (EDI) by Tesco, the food retailer - but a year
later it is more than satisfied with the result.
Tunnock's, as the company is known, has been baking in Uddington, on the
outskirts of Glasgow, for more than 100 years. Today this family business
has a Pounds 25m turnover and 700 staff; its biscuits, chocolate and caramel
wafers, tea cakes and marshmallow Snowballs are exported to more than 30
countries.
Tunnock's moved into computing in a big way in 1990, replacing its
accounting package with a total financial, sales, production and materials
management system from Trifid Software and installing a bigger computer from
McDonnell Douglas Information Systems.
The system is accessed by 30 terminals and personal computers, including
three in the London office, which previously sent orders to the head office
by post.
Soon after the Trifid system went live, Tunnock's found Tesco promoting EDI.
'Tesco wanted us to use its package, sent us details of the product,
training, costs and so on,' says computer systems manager Mr Joe Hailey.
'No one here knew anything about EDI, so we held back until we'd looked into
it.
'Tesco never said we had to go EDI or else, but we got the impression that
if we didn't we would have no more business from them.'
Mr Hailey says its big retail chain customers were very helpful in getting
Tunnock's into EDI and that the whole operation 'went very smoothly.'
Tunnock's settled on an EDI software package from Trifid's sister company,
Kewill Xetal. It costs around Pounds 900. This package provides access to
all EDI services, an important consideration for Tunnock's, because another
big customer, Safeway, uses the IBM EDI network rather than the INS Tradanet
service favoured by Tesco.
Tunnock's uses a personal computer to link to Tradanet: this is the cheapest
way of connecting, because INS bases its charges on the size of the trader's
computer. So another package, a Pounds 250 product from Pixel Innovations,
has been added to convert the EDI messages into the format the Trifid system
can understand and vice versa.
IT cost Tunnock's Pounds 5,200 to join the Tradanet service, including the
necessary software, training and consultancy, so the total set-up cost,
including the Kewill Xetal and Pixel packages, was around Pounds 6,350.
There is now a monthly charge to INS of just over Pounds 80, or Pounds 975 a
year. So far, Tunnock's only uses EDI to receive orders and this is free on
Tradanet, although there is a storage charge if messages are not removed
after seven days.
Tunnock's now trades electronically with Tesco, ASDA, Sainsbury and Safeway
and sees clear benefits.
'Orders come in by EDI and pass into the Trifid system, so details are
available in minutes to everyone in the organisation: for example, to senior
executives for management information and to production people,' Joe Hailey
says.
'The more companies we trade with electronically, the greater the benefits
of EDI.
'We pride ourselves on the fact that we make to order, so our products are
always fresh. Now, as more and more companies send us orders via EDI
directly into the Trifid system, we can set up longer production runs,
handling two or three orders at a time.
'With EDI and the Trifid business system, orders sent by our customers on
Monday can be scheduled for production on Wednesday and delivered on
Thursday. Previously, orders might come through the post from the London
office and someone might spend an hour a day keying the information in from
documents that had already been produced by hand. This slowed our response
to orders and was naturally error-prone.'
Joe Hailey says around 50 of Tunnock's 300 or more customers are probably of
suitable size and computing sophistication to trade electronically.
EDI could also be used to trade with a dozen or so suppliers. These
suppliers include giant groups in the sugar and chocolate business. However,
Tunnock's is working initially with its main packaging supplier here: an
Edinburgh company, William Thyne. The project is William Thyne's first move
into EDI.
'We're not pushing them into it,' says Mr Hailey.
'They were keen to pursue it and we are their ideal EDI partner, as one of
their biggest customers.'
Meanwhile Tunnock's is expanding its EDI relationship with some of its
customers.
'Tesco is talking to us about sending us sales forecasts,' says Mr Hailey.
'This will be useful for our production people especially.'
From being a rather anxious newcomer to EDI, Tunnock's has become something
of an enthusiastic user and keen to exploit it in different ways.
'The fact that we're into EDI will make a difference for our sales manager
when he's talking to new customers,' says Joe Hailey.
'We can be up-and-running in days and then we can process orders quickly and
there's no danger of orders going missing.
'Initially, when we only had EDI links to one customer, we weren't certain
about the benefits. But EDI is certainly paying for itself now.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (17): Supermarket
pioneer / Here and on the following pages, John Kavanagh examines electronic
trading from the different perspectives of customers and suppliers in the
EDI chain - and uncovers the benefits and problems
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CHECK-OUT operators in a Tesco food supermarket are the only human link in
the entire business chain of recording sales, amending and checking stock
records, re-ordering goods, receiving and checking invoices and making
payment.
All these actions are handled entirely automatically and are sparked off by
sales recorded at the check-out point.
Tesco has been a pioneer in electronic data interchange (EDI) and heads the
biggest retail EDI community outside the US. Over 1,200 suppliers, supplying
more than 95 per cent of the products on Tesco supermarket shelves, now
trade electronically with the company.
Almost half these suppliers send their invoices to Tesco by EDI. And a
quarter have an even closer relationship, receiving 13-week sales forecasts
through the EDI network.
Tesco has been using the INS Tradanet EDI service since 1987. During that
time it has also installed barcode scanners at most of its 400-odd
supermarkets.
This combination of EDI and scanning has enabled it to automate its trading
from end to end.
The check-out terminal records sales of individual items. Every evening
Tesco's central mainframe computer system connects automatically to each
supermarket computer to retrieve that sales data.
The data brings stock files up to date and the new levels determine whether
orders should be placed and the size of those orders. The orders are sent
through the EDI service to suppliers, many of which can send ba ck their
invoices by EDI. The Tesco systems can then produce cheques from the
invoices. These payments, too, could be made automatically through EDI if
Tesco and other retail chains could come to agreement with the banks (see
applications debate, page 18).
All this happens without any human involvement. The benefits have been so
great that Tesco has given up measuring them - 'benefits? You name it,' says
stock management director Mr Dave MacInnis. 'We know for certain that we've
reduced stock levels yet improved stock availability and sales, cut lead
times on orders, cut administration, improved communications with our
suppliers. It's not just EDI that has brought the benefits - it's all bound
up with other developments such as barcode scanning - but EDI has been very
much the enabling tool.'
The benefits are so great that the costs of running EDI through the Tradanet
service are 'absolutely negligible,' Mr MacInnis says: 'The basic running
costs are covered by our savings on use of the phone, fax and mail. That
means we have achieved all the business benefits for nothing.'
EDI and scanning have also enabled Tesco to re-organise its distribution, to
the benefit of itself and its suppliers. Deliveries from suppliers now go to
eight warehouses instead of directly to the supermarkets. The precise sales
data gathered each night allows orders to be placed on the warehouses as
close as possible to the time the goods will be sold.
This means the supermarkets only need hold minimal stocks, so they can
devote more space to sales. The number of deliveries is reduced to a
minimum, as all goods come from one Tesco warehouse rather than from
separate suppliers. And all checking of the quality and quantities delivered
by suppliers is done at the warehouses rather than at individual stores.
The suppliers benefit by receiving just one order for each warehouse, rather
than separate orders from hundreds of stores.
Similarly, they only deliver to the warehouses. The savings in their
distribution costs give Tesco the opportunity to negotiate better terms.
Dave MacInnis reacts sharply to suggestions that Tesco enjoys such benefits
from EDI that it has threatened to cut off suppliers which do not sign up.
'We see EDI as a cornerstone in the effective management of our supply chain
and those of our suppliers,' he says. 'Our insistence might sometimes come
across as bullying, but where do you draw the line between that and saying
this is the way we see business going: towards greater efficiency and the
elimination of paperwork.'
He adds: 'The success of our approach is shown by the fact that we have not
de-listed a single supplier or threatened to do so. In a recession some
companies are reluctant to invest in a new broom, let alone something like
EDI. Yet we've got hundreds of companies which are saving money on
traditionally paper-bound activities such as order processing and
invoicing.'
Around 200 suppliers have yet to sign up for EDI, although most are
companies supplying specialist products or services in low volumes, such as
fascias for stores. Tesco helps companies get going, not least through a
Tesco account team at INS. Dave MacInnis says it takes about six weeks from
an initial meeting to get a company 'going live.'
TESCO has now started communicating with individuals in its supplier
companies through INS' electronic mail service. There are 4,000 electronic
mail users in Tesco and they can communicate with 3,000 contacts in 200
suppliers.
Dave MacInnis points to the benefits of electronic mail, such as the ability
to send reports and memos directly from personal computers and the
elimination of problems in trying to telephone an elusive business contact.
Tesco is also providing sales forecasts via EDI to over 280 suppliers. It
works on sales history data, seasonal factors, local knowledge, planned
promotions, load sizes and so on to produce forecasts of up to 13 weeks by
product and by warehouse. This helps suppliers schedule production and
reduce their own stocks and lead times.
Tesco's exploitation of EDI certainly adds a new significance to that can of
baked beans about to pass through the check-out.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (16): Investment
pays dividends, say users - Britain leads the way in Europe in applying
electronic data interchange services, although it is still early days for
the concept.  Now EDI suppliers are seeking to attract thousands of small
company users / Suppliers
</HEADLINE>

THE SUPPLIERS of electronic data interchange (EDI) services are far from
satisfied with UK market growth which the research company Input says is
running at over 25 per cent a year, writes John Kavanagh.
Market leader INS has already slashed its prices this year, following price
changes by competitors in 1992. Newcomer British Telecom still negotiates
each contract individually and is 'doing some good deals,' according to
users. It expects to publish a standard price list this spring.
'EDI penetration in the UK is still only five per cent,' says Mr Neil
Lawrence, EDI commercial manager at BT. 'Only 300 of the Times top 1,000 use
it, although there is a lot of interest during the recession, because it
cuts costs.
'We expect the number of top 1,000 companies using EDI to double in the next
two or three years - and each big company brings in another 2,000 or more of
its suppliers.'
INS is going directly for those smaller companies with its price cuts.
'We signed more than 1,100 companies last year, almost a quarter of our
total, but there is more serious competition now and we want to stimulate
growth still further,' says INS managing director Mr Lee Tate. 'Big growth
will only continue if we attract the thousands and thousands of small
companies.'
INS, jointly owned by ICL and international EDI service company GEIS, was
set up in 1985 to launch the Tradanet service, defined by the Article Number
Association, for retailers and their suppliers. It claims to have 55 per
cent of the UK market from this and other EDI communities. Around 6m
documents pass through its network each month.
INS' traditional rival has been AT&amp;T-Istel. Then come IBM, GEIS and, since
October 1991, BT.
In Europe as a whole, research analysts at IDC estimate INS and GEIS equal
with 33 per cent, IBM with 13 per cent and AT&amp;T with nine per cent.
There are links between the services: an early complaint about INS and
AT&amp;T-Istel was that users had to connect to both networks to trade
electronically with all their customers. However, this was no longer an
issue for companies interviewed by Software At Work. Even smaller companies
trading with customers on different networks preferred to have separate
connections to each network.
'Interconnectivity is a lot more than just communications links,' says Mr
David Elliott, EDI manager at British Gas. 'When you link to one service,
you have a complete audit trail: you know your message arrived and when
someone looked at it. I'd rather pay for the link direct to the separate
services than use the bridges between them.'
Several users made similar comments, pointing to possible problems of
sorting out legal responsibility if a message got lost.
As well as network providers, the EDI market also includes companies
providing software for linking to the various networks and converting data
into and out of the correct message formats.
Input says network services currently account for just over 60 per cent of
the European market, software for 16 per cent and consultancy for 23 per
cent. It expects network services to grow to 72 per cent by 1997, at the
expense of consultancy.
Charging structures vary from one network supplier to the next. There is
generally a one-off joining fee of Pounds 200-Pounds 250 for a personal
computer link.
After that, comparisons are difficult: software for handling links to one or
more services can cost up to Pounds 2,750 for a personal computer or between
Pounds 1,500 and Pounds 55,000 for a mainframe, depending on the facilities
required.
Some suppliers make a monthly charge (INS' is Pounds 50) which includes free
receipt of any amount of data and a small charge for sending it; others have
no monthly fee but charge for both sending and receiving. This means charges
per 1,000 characters can range from 2.5p to 10p.
After all the complicated pricing formulae have been compared, personal
computer users will find EDI will probably cost them a few hundred pounds a
year. Mainframe users will pay considerably more: IBM says Pounds 10,000 is
a typical running cost for the first year alone, when a company is likely to
have only a few EDI partners.
However, all users, of varying sizes and usage, contacted by Software At
Work felt their initial investment and running costs were paying dividends.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (15): How to save
time, effort and money - EDI is a simple idea with big business implications
/ Analysis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAVANAGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC data interchange (EDI) is a simple idea which both users and
service suppliers see as a direct path to the goals of just-in-time trading
and business re-organisation.
On the surface it is simply the exchange of routine business documents such
as orders, acknowledgements and invoices between computers run by suppliers
and their customers.
This itself is enough of a justification for companies to move into EDI, as
the case studies in the following pages show.
It has been estimated that 50-70 per cent of all computer output becomes
computer input. Without EDI, information is keyed into one computer, printed
as an order, posted to a supplier and keyed in again. And this process is
repeated down the supply chain.
At each stage there are delays as documents go through the post, get passed
between departments and are keyed in. The greater the human involvement, the
greater the risk of error: research shows that 15 per cent of the value of
invoices raised in the UK is lost because of errors or misplaced documents.
EDI can remove all human involvement and transfer documents in seconds.
Tesco has automated its business chain to such an extent that orders,
invoices and payments are all triggered off by shoppers passing through
supermarket check-outs - and there is no other human involvement at all in
the entire chain.
There are clear benefits here from the elimination of paperwork. In
addition, the huge cuts in the time between identifying a need for more
stocks and getting an order processed and delivered have paved the way for
just-in-time ordering and manufacturing.
This, in turn, is leading the EDI pioneers into closer partnerships with
their suppliers, in some cases invoicing themselves for goods received and
providing information such as sales forecasts. At the same time, EDI is
adding an extra dimension to price negotiations, with customers arguing for
bigger discounts because their suppliers are saving money with EDI and
getting prompt payment through EDI banking services.
'EDI presents the opportunity to modify the relationship between business
partners which recognise their mutual dependence and endeavour to build on
it together for greater success,' says EDI consultant Mr Jon Sasserath of
computing services group CMG.
As with the early days of the fax machine (and, indeed, the telephone), the
extent to which the benefits outweigh the costs depends on the number of
partners that a company can trade with electronically. EDI is used by only
around five per cent of companies in the UK, which is far ahead of all other
European countries.
This issue is summed up by Mr Martyn Daniels, systems strategy controller at
the B&amp;Q DIY chain and chairman of the user group for the Tradanet EDI
service: 'We don't want to have to run two finance departments and two
logistics departments, one manual and the other electronic.'
This understandable attitude has led to accusations that big companies have
pushed their suppliers into EDI with threats of cutting off their business.
Two medium-sized suppliers to big groups, interviewed for this survey, both
used almost exactly the same words when asked about justifying the costs -
'we didn't need a cost-justification, because the cost of not going EDI
would have been no more business.'
However, these and all the other companies interviewed were well-satisfied
with EDI and looking to expand their use, both in their relationships with
their major customers and in trading with their own suppliers.
Mr David Andrews, head of the Andersen Consulting's Financial Services
Division, looks at the influence of the big companies from another angle. He
argues that each big trading community needs a controlling body or sponsor.
Without it, there is a danger that the EDI service company can be in charge,
locking trading partners in, he says.
David Andrews points to cases such as that of Tesco, where a big customer
leads the development and helps its smaller trading partners, and to other
areas where rival companies have got together to set up a trading community
through a single EDI service supplier which they monitor through a
management committee (there are examples of such communities in the
following pages).
All the companies interviewed by Soft
ware At Work found the move into EDI was fairly straightforward technically.
Service suppliers, software companies and even the big EDI trading partners
offer software packages which handle links into the different services and
the conversion of data from business systems into the correct message format
standards.
Users seem unconcerned about the fact that different industries and groups
of users follow different standards. There is a general gradual move to the
international Edifact standard but the various EDI services already provide
conversion from one standard to another if required, so users see themselves
little affected. As Jon Sasserath at CMG puts it: 'Implementing the
technology is a piece of cake, especially when compared with defining,
planning and implementing the strategic business move that EDI should
represent.'
David Andrews at Andersen Consulting agrees: 'Businesses need to aim for a
more efficient processes, a whole step change. This goes well beyond EDI,
which is not a solution but a very important tool.'
And Mr Sasserath concludes: 'EDI is the way forward. The future prosperity,
even survival, of a business may depend on implementing it successfully. EDI
may be inflicted on companies or it may be a mutual decision. But the old
adage still applies: there will be those who make it happen, those who let
it happen - and those who wondered what the hell happened.'

 -Consultant's Critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL

<TEXT>
'IT'S a product - ship it]' is a running joke in my company. It is usually
uttered when a new program runs for the first time. But we know that a
project is only finished when all the customers are happy. In some
companies, managers are pushed into announcing success prematurely for PR
and marketing reasons.
Hornet/WASP is not yet finished. While promising, it can hardly be an
example to other businesses until it is working across BT. I would need to
return in one to two years to make an accurate judgment.
More interesting is the process that BT uses to evaluate proposals. Many
companies trust in spreadsheets and graphs which are ultimately based upon
figures derived on the back of cigarette packets. In contrast, BT has
formalised project evaluation. It even has a team of project appraisal
specialists who help project managers derive the required figures.
To its credit, BT does require net present value (NPV) as one of the top
criteria although it cannot bear to part with the outmoded internal rate of
return or payback period.
BT's drive to standardise work processes is a classic method of attempting
to reduce costs and increase control. Their choice of 'best current
practice' has benefits but considerable risks. Whatever they choose in IT
strategy will be obsolete in five years' time. BT must ensure that a drive
to standardise does not inhibit innovation. With many hungry new companies
entering the telecoms market, BT must not allow itself to be technologically
eclipsed.
Key points of this case:
It isn't finished just because the trials look good.
All new projects need to be assessed accurately using modern techniques.
Standardisation can reduce costs but provision must be made for ongoing
innovation.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (13): Substantial
business benefits for BT - How software helps track complex projects and
reduce operational costs / Large scale application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN a company the size of British Telecom, with annual capital investment of
Pounds 2.5bn, an efficient project management system is vital. BT Worldwide
Networks had long experience of various software packages for project
management because efficiency in that area is so central to its business.
(BT is famous for having 'one of everything' on the software market, to keep
abreast of new technology). Nevertheless, BTWN wanted to simplify the
situation and reduce operational costs by fixing on one package.
It comes as a surprise that, when standardising on a country-wide system for
its project management, BT picked a little-known system, Hornet. It comes
from a small software house, Claremont Controls, based in Morpeth in the
North East, (see details, page 14). When BT took delivery of Hornet XT last
April, it became Claremont's premier customer, and something of a pioneer
with the software.
BT's entire business is dependent on technology (see company snapshot,
facing page). It is constantly installing new exchanges and updating older
equipment on a country-wide basis. As might be expected, there were a number
of methods being used to keep track of projects, including paper and a
variety of software tools.
BT is constantly working on a large scale. Where there were 60 areas ten
years ago (and relatively little PM computerisation), there are now eight
zones, plus London. Any one zone might have 15,000 jobs running
concurrently. The tendency to take a wider, 'macro level' view makes
information flow vital to managers, according to Bob Martin Royle, who heads
the Wasp/Hornet programme.
'The senior field planning managers need visibility across a wider and wider
area, with efficient support tools to enable them to plan, monitor and
control their capital works programmes. The whole point is to manage our
capital investment programme more efficiently.'
IN 30 years he has seen the evolution of paper-based systems and the rise of
computer-based project management, and is familiar with products such as
Artemis and SuperProject, which were already in use at BT.
With 400 full-time project managers across the country, standardisation
became important - 'there are significant business benefits in getting our
own systems standardised,' explains BT implementation manager Martin Baker.
'Once we've chosen tools, we can work on standardising practives and
procedures which improve control of the investment programme, to such a
degree that clients will notice improved efficiency.' Although BT uses IBM
mainframes to run its telephone exchange administration, it has an open
systems development policy for in-house work, and runs a number of
Unix-based minicomputers. There was not a wide selection of project
management systems available under Unix, and a further requirement, that of
interfacing with the Informix database, narrowed the field even further.
The Informix integration was important because BT Worldwide Networks had
already invested a great deal in building an Informix-based system,
co-incidentally called Wasp - the Works And Stores Programme - which stores
all the details of various jobs under way. The plan was to link Wasp and
Hornet to BT's own standards. Choosing the Hornet system was only the start
of the story.
The introduction, user consultation, and user sampling of Hornet has itself
been the subject of a large in-house project. To implement the system, BT
Group Computing Services has had to design and provide a national data
communications network to accommodate an additional 3,300 users. BTWN
started its own training programme for an eventual 4,000 users.
THE problem with which users have to deal on a day-to-day basis, as
Martin-Royle points out, is that change is the only constant. However
well-planned the existing timetable of works, there are always new and
changing requirements, 'injected works' which alter the picture - 'we're in
a competitive environment and have to respond to new needs, and with them
the 'what if?' scenario, all the time.'
He describes his role as very much the user's champion, and his working
party, when defining its standard system, had well-defined wish list. They
wanted a user friendly system, compatible with other BT systems, which would
allow direct data transfer when ordering stores and allocating resources,
with the ability to give a clear screen-based overview of the work
programmes and how they impacted one another.
Critical path analysis, 'what if' facilities, electronic mail and automatic
report production were vital. Hornet, he believes, fitted the current 'best
practice.'
Martin-Royle, Martin Baker, and project manager Doug Turner are in clear
agreement that at some point, requirements have to be 'frozen,' and the
potential 'jam tomorrow' of newer, promised products abandoned in favour of
something that works here and now. On the ground level, every job BT does
has to be planned, and resources allocated in a strict order. Tactical
planning is the term it uses for the process of identifying the
requirements, and deciding on the best option, for example, installing
additional exchange switching equipment.
The next phase is the traditional 'works planning,' which provides a
detailed forecast of the materials and resources necessary for each job.
This might include a site survey, measurement of cable runs, breakdown of
materials, and cost estimates. Hornet's role is to support the programme and
project levels, producing a schedule of jobs. Wasp is used to track the
actual execution of jobs against the scheduled dates. BT had evolved Wasp,
its works database for all Worldwide Networks internal jobs, out of a
previous Internal Works Info System, IWIS. Used together, the two allow for
cradle-to-grave planning of activities, down to the level of individuals
being allotted to specific tasks at given sites and times. Projects and
injected work requests are logged on to Hornet at the tactical planning
stage, and assessed for the timescale in which they can be achieved. Hornet
helps plan and delivery, through gaining financial authority for the spend,
down to detailed planning, cost estimation, and stores ordering.
It also monitors the job progress, jeopardy, and completion. The 'jeopardy'
part is one of the greatest benefits, as it allows managers to see much
earlier when a job is in danger of running late, or going over budget.
Another advantage is that it is much easier, with systematically stored
information, to see what jobs have in common.
'One installation of an exchange will be very like another in certain
respects,' explains Doug Turner. 'Process management enables us to define a
'template' of a particular sort of job.'
He is rolling the project out in phases over a two-year period with
'facilitators' running workshops and spreading the word. Due to the careful
selection process, in which he says everyone had a voice, there is quite a
demand for the system - 'the problem is to stop people leaping ahead and
asking for more before it's implemented,' he says.
One development he has noted is that managers using the system have begun to
discuss their jobs they with a peer group, and compare performance. It would
be strange if BT, or all organisations, were not to realise the potential of
electronic mail and 'automatic' communications, and this is integral in
Hornet's works.
'If the date for something changes, the scheduling facility send automatic
messages,' says Martin Baker. More than 10 per cent of the mail comes from
outside BT, through 'closed user groups,' including suppliers.
John Smith, based in Leeds, is one of the pilot users of Hornet/Wasp. He is
the manager of field programme control for the north-east zone, stretching
from the Pennines to the east coast, and from Lincolnshire up to the Scots
border.
'We use the scheduling capabilities of Hornet all the time to tell us
whether the work is achievable,' he says. Six people are constantly using
the system, which, he says, improves all the time as they become familiar
with it - 'it's telling us when deadlines aren't likely to be met. Now, we
get the opportunity to be pro-active, rather than reactive.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (11): Topics in the
next issue - Software at Work / Readers' response to 'feedback survey'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS issue of Software At Work deals with two main subjects: project
management (PM) and electronic data interchange, EDI. These two 'user
topics,' topped the voting list of topics in our recent 'feedback' report
from readers. As a result, we have held over our third topic - rapid
application development - until our summer issue in June.
We have taken note of your preferences, and covered both PM and EDI
extensively in this issue, as well as replacing Desktop publishing with
Teleworking as a topic for our next issue. We would also wish to thank
readers who took the trouble to reply to the Feedback Survey, as the votes
have given us valuable guidance. Replies are still coming in, following our
winter issue, (December 6, 1992). We intend to do a full analysis, and
report on the full results.
The next issue of Software At Work in June will look at:
Teleworking (see details, right).
Facilities Management and outsourcing.
Rapid Applications Development, (held over from the March issue).
Teleworking has appeared on the agenda of many companies wishing to cut down
office overheads, and make staff in the field more effective. The increasing
power of laptop and personal computers has been accompanied by software
which has become easier to use, and therefore more practical for 'sit-alone'
users. We are looking for stories which demonstrate positive business
benefits in teleworking.
Facilities management deals with another move outside, as large
computer-users divest themselves of in-house IT operations. Companies are
contracting-out to FM specialists with the aim of concentrating on the core
business.
The first two 'user' topics, follow the usual pattern of interviewing users
of various products and services.
Users and suppliers wishing to participate in the survey should contact
Software At Work at the following address, stating which topic is of
interest and requesting the relevant forms.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (12): Ease of use
becomes a compelling issue - Training / Microsoft Project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMPUTER training company, Oxford Computer Training might be expected to
be biased about Microsoft's project management system, Project. It describes
itself as 'Microsoft's favourite trainer,' having won a training award from
the software supplier, writes Claire Gooding.
OCT has already trained hundreds of people to use Project, which has created
something of a market niche for OCT. From exploring the product to teach it
to others, Oxford Computer Training discovered how closely it fitted its own
needs, and is now using it both for scheduling courses and for planning the
development of courseware.
The company, a division of the Oxford Computer Group with a Pounds 1.5m
turnover, employs 30 full-time trainers and specialises in Microsoft
products, particularly under Windows. It has used Project in conjunction
with other Microsoft products such as Excel, Word, Mail, PowerPoint, Visual
Basic, Access and SuperBase. To date, it has invested in Project to the tune
of Pounds 2,500, and now half a dozen trainers and managers use it on a
regular basis.
Before discovering Project, the company had been a long-term user of The
OpenPlan package from Welcome Software Technology, for which it also runs
training courses. (OpenPlan was mentioned by several interviewees in the
Software At Work survey. It is about to be re-launched in a Windows version
from WST, based in Southbank Technopark, Elephant and Castle, south London.)
But OpenPlan was really on too grand a scale for a small company, and other
PC-based options proved either light on functions, or not as user-friendly
as Project.
'Project has proved ideal for a small company environment, and extremely
powerful,' says James Cowling, development manager. Oxford Computer
Training's teachers write their own courses, and Project is used in
conjunction with a database to schedule staff resources between lecturing
and courseware development. Producing the courseware is itself a software
development project, and Project is u sed to plan and allocate resources.
'For us, ease-of-use was a compelling issue, but for historical reasons it
was extremely important that it was part of the Microsoft family,' says
James Cowling.
He believes that his company, being experts in testing software to the
limits, has taken Project as far as it can go in terms of customising it and
'tweaking' it to in-house use.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (10): New way of
managing skills and resources / Case study of Rockwell Graphics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE paper you're reading
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
at least in the UK edition - was printed on a press made by Rockwell Graphic
Systems, a leading manufacturer of printing presses for newspapers.
Every printing press is slightly different, and every customised delivery
involves the scheduling of a variety of skills and resources as the press is
commissioned. Sometimes this happens on the other side of the world - and to
co-ordinate its resources, Rockwell uses Artemis, the mainframe-based
software from Lucas Management Systems.
When installing outside the UK, Rockwell had felt that the problems of
controlling resources were magnified by distance.
'It was a matter of bringing down the time it takes to install a printing
press and reduce costs, ' explains Maurice Leyland, the manager of
information and material systems.
'We felt we had a problem, but we didn't know what was on the market, and
the first goal was to find out exactly what was needed.'
Decision-making, he admits, was very much by 'gut feel,' using very simple
reports - 'it was a matter of establishing control over an inherently manual
process,' he adds.
With 20 projects annually, and each taking nine months to a year to
complete, the main problem was scheduling scarce resources, such as the
skilled software engineer who set up the presses. The experience of two
full-time project managers, one with an engineering background was a help in
establishing a detailed requirements' analysis.
'It was a focusing exercise. We came up with the need for project management
disciplines,' he adds. The requirements' definition that followed was
derived from establishing the information which Rockwell thought it should
be providing to its customers.
'We wanted graphics to help us demonstrate that we were in full control of
all eventualities in the installation process,' explains Maurice Leyland. 'I
call it the 'gee whizz factor'.'
ROCKWELL wanted a mainframe product, and although it explored several PC
products as well, it found them incapable of managing multiple projects
which all called on the same scarce resources.
Artemis fulfilled the requirements of user-friendliness, and provided the
scheduling facilities Rockwell wanted, as well as needing little extra in
the way of hardware resources, since it fitted on the existing IBM
mainframe.
Rockwell also makes use of a PC tool, Schedule Publisher, which links with
the mainframe. There was also board-level interest in the choice, for the
need for a solution was recognised worldwide. It was also seen as something
that would link with all other Rockwell systems, such as production control
and material requirements' planning.
It would even have a role in the sales function, providing strong control
from the start, so that sales, engineering, manufacturing and customer
services would all work more closely together.
The entire contract was worth Pounds 500,000, split more or less equally
between the cost of the software, and training and consultancy. The software
project is 'owned' by customer services, and the in-house effort to promote
its use is driven by Frank Williams, customer services manager.
Maurice Leyland believes that use of the product has forced some changes for
the better - 'there are a lot of thought processes that have to be changed.
We're going to break down the barriers between different areas of
specialisation. Everything becomes visible.'
However, he offers some valuable advice: 'Beware of the expense. It's a
costly commitment over a long period of time and the expense comes far ahead
of the benefits, The lifespan of a two or three-year order means that the
benefits are not visible straight away.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (9): A pilot's view
of the bottlenecks - Consultant's Critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRUH family clearly prefer to manage using the 'flying by the seat of
the pants' method. They have shared values and a strong vision of the
company's future direction. Computers are employed where they give an
advantage - and ignored where they seem more trouble than they're worth.
Mr Robert Bruh uses 'SuperProject' somewhat like a fighter pilot uses an
altimeter. It says where the ground is, but that information isn't as
valuable as knowing where the enemy is located.
Frank Usher uses project management tools merely as a one-off test for
bottlenecks, rather than on a day-to-day basis. This limits the bene fits
that the package could bring. If there is a delayin fabric supplies, Mr Bruh
relies on his instincts for re-scheduling, rather than upon the software .
It seems a limited use of a software tool. Other companies we have studied
have seen considerable savings by using project management tools to manage
unforeseen events.
I doubt Frank Usher's management can fully tackle all the complex
re-arrangement of works in their heads. Their command of the business may
mean that they survive, nonetheless. It is a contrast with many companies
who become slaves to IT - and take their eyes off their customers and
competitors.
Key points of this study:
Use information technology (IT) as and when it is appropriate.
IT is only a tool to help your business.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (8): Fashion house's
designer label solution - When it comes to project management, the fashion
business and 'special occasion' ladies' wear has more in common with
engineering and construction projects than might at first be imagined / Case
study of Frank Usher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE a cocktail party waiting to happen, ranks of dresses shimmer under
wraps in the Frank Usher warehouse. Each glittering creation is the
end-product of many processes, each requiring skills of differing levels. At
its inception every dress draws on the rare skills of the top fashion
designer, whose name might appear on the all-important label.
It might seem a strange place to find a project management system surrounded
by costly fabrics and fashion sketches. But in the office of Frank Usher's
merchandising director Robert Bruh, Computer Associates' SuperProject
software package has played an important part in re-evaluating some key
relationships in the design and manufacturing process.
Like all companies, (see business profile, facing page), Frank Usher has
been seeking to cut overheads. In the fashion business, buyers expect a high
quality product on time. To meet its deadlines, the manufacturer simply had
to expend whatever time, material and was necessary to get the dress right,
and on time - 'everybody had their own ideas about where the overheads were
occurring, but it was a matter of proving a gut feel,' says Mr Bruh.
He undertook a one-off project to examine the processes, and how they affect
one another. What he has discovered has itself triggered off another
three-year project to restructure and link various systems, streamlining to
the point that overheads become slimmer than a selvedge.
The various labels at Frank Usher include ready-to-wear party clothes,
special occasion suits, and more casual, but still dressy, lycra wear. The
outfits are despatched in dozens to outlets all over the world: over half
the output is exported, notably to Germany.
In the UK, they sell in high volumes through stores such as Harrods and
Selfridges, but small, elegant high-street boutiques also buy in small
batches of four or five dresses. Typically, they are bought for special
occasions: dinner dances, parties, weddings, and other celebrations. Clothes
designed by Tom Bowker and Gerald McCann appear on the backs of names so
famous that discretion is more valuable than publicity.
The company deals in the glamour of high fashion, but is underpinned by
precision planning. Every yard of taffeta or velvet, every sequin swirl and
jewelled button, is an item for which someone has to account.
Because of the nature of its business, Frank Usher acts as both buyer and
seller to some of its suppliers. First it commissions individual fabrics and
items, to realise prototypes. After a catwalk exhibition, the chosen
garments go into production, and Frank Usher may be buying individual
components in bulk from any one of its dozens of overseas suppliers.
Each garment is a microcosm of the manufacturing process. It has a prototype
stage: the design, the implementation of the design on its appropriate
fabric (still done with paper patterns), and the prototype modelling of
every detail.
'We run an extraordinarily complicated business,' explains Robert Bruh. 'We
buy and sell material, manufacture, distribute, subcontract labour, and buy
goods. We deal with multiple suppliers and thousands of customers. We're
serving an enormous matrix.'
The garment details - a piece of embroidery or a sequin detail - might have
to go through several stages before being agreed upon, and ordered in bulk.
If a prototype goes wrong, the whole process starts again, with the
re-ordering of the fabric sample, and the resulting chain of administ rative
processing.
The high level of clerical and administrative activity was, to Robert Bruh,
merely the symptom of a worse ill.
'There was a duplication of paperwork, lots of islands of information with
too few bridges between them,' he says.
ROBERT BRUH tackled the task of bringing down the overheads with all the
energy and thoroughness usually devoted to keeping fabric suppliers up to
the mark. Despite describing himself as 'totally IT-illiterate', he has an
evident grasp of IT language, and the real issues and implications behind
it. He enlisted the help of a Chesham-based consultancy, Catalyst, whose
previous work for the retail sector gave them a grasp of the overall
business requirements.
Consultant Jeremy Marchant recommended that the closest fit for his
evaluation exercise would be a project management package. Catalyst chose,
supplied, and implemented SuperProject in a turnkey contract, although it is
also involved in assessing other strategic IT requirements at the company.
Bruh then commissioned a time and work study by a pair of MBA students from
the London Business School. Each of the 700 designs was treated as a
separate project. The 700 included different sizes of individual designs,
because 'grading' (re-engineering one pattern to a larger size) was a
separate and skilled process for each. Every operation was given a
time-and-cost value (based on salaries for specific jobs), right down to the
minutes spent filling out fabric requisitions by clerks.
IN THE manufacturing process, there were deep-seated issues to tackle. The
revelation came in establishing that in the thirty or so processes involved
from start to finish, the design process itself never stopped until
production actually started. This was not the in-house perception. It also
became clear, from using Gantt time-charts, network diagrams, and critical
path analysis, that more time was spent in 'wastage' in the 17 days of the
production process than was actually spent making things.
There was little overlap: processes were discrete, and so resources could
not be re-allocated or shifted about within the project. The SuperProject
model was brought down to individual names: Maureen couldn't start her job
until Anne had taken a decision on colour.
'At the end of three months we had reliable information which began to
reflect reality. We learned to look at people as individuals but also as
time resources. It became clear why we needed as many as eight
pattern-makers,' says Bruh.
The consultant, Jeremy Marchant adds that 'the really valuable thing was to
see how the processes affect one another.'
Across hundreds of styles, the pattern emerged: there was a 90 per cent
failure in the first try-out of a specific garment. It was the re-iterating
evolution of a product to the point that worked in both design and
engineering terms that was bringing about the extra cost - 'on top of one
bottleneck was a whole string of disasters waiting to happen.'
Robert Bruh could see this clearly, but, with the help of graphics, was also
able prove it and make it obvious to everyone involved. The key was to bring
design and engineering rooms, traditionally separate, together in one united
team. One of the simplest, but most far-reaching changes has been wrought by
simply sitting the two close together.
The designers are now designated as holding responsibility for the entire
process: sharing information and getting people to act upon it is part of
that brief. It became the designer's job to close the gap which had engineer
'tweak' designs so that they were workable, but no longer exactly what had
been specified.
PLANNING and proving on paper that things can be improved is a different
matter from actually bringing about the necessary changes. Robert Bruh is
clear about how to tackle the psychological issues: 'Start with the managing
director, and drive the change downwards. And don't try to make individuals
change. The thing we aimed for was groupwork practices, so that the group
forces the change from within.'
Left to itself to evolve a leader, he suggests, the group is less likely to
resist change seen as both an imposition and an interference from an
outsider - 'it has educated me to pick on targets that are achievable. We
need to achieve the same tasks with tighter skills, as a team.
'I believe I see a way forward, but it's also a much bigger process . . .
that takes years.'
Robert Bruh admits that he made unorthodox use of project management
techniques, but is nevertheless delighted with what he has achieved.
SuperProject, he says, gave him the means to provide and explore management
information. He now uses it as a thermometer, to set targets, test and
evaluate, and intends to return to using it again in future investigations.
WHAT he has discovered has set in process a plan that will eventually
embrace all aspects of operations. In the past he has made some innovative
and bold moves, and had the foresight to adopt an 'open' Unix-based system
early in the 1980s.
The software, originally acquired from UCMS, has been adapted and rewritten
extensively - Bruh reckons about 80 per cent. Frank Usher also has a small
but very effective programming team, whose work in the Progress 4GL has
added extensions to the original package.
Mr Bruh is now thinking in terms of electronic data interchange between
factories, coding fabric stocks as well as individual garments, linking the
purchasing database with the existing CAD-CAM system and updating management
information as costs change.
He is keen to move away from the much-extended old materials handling and
purchasing system - 'next time around, we'll go for a database that will
allow easy extraction of management information.'
The project management system is a valuable part of the toolkit, and he
plans to integrate SuperProject into the next generation of company-wide
systems.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (6): User-friendly
system - Small company application / Juste Communications
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS becoming a common experience to find the phone answered not by a
central switchboard, but by someone in a specific department, writes Claire
Gooding. Such 'key' systems are becoming more popular, and Juste
Communications, based in Hatfield, is a telecommunications company
specialising in installing them.
It installs GPT (GEC Plessey Telecommunications) digital telephone systems,
as well as holding a Mercury dealership. It has only eight staff, who
nevertheless generated a Pounds 437,000 turnover in 1992, with profits of
Pounds 37,000.
According to Aaron Lubrani, financial director, his customers dislike
dealing with a large operation such as BT - 'they have to make multiple
contacts to do with the installation of one service. We undertake the entire
responsibility for that, including the liaisons, and that's a major selling
point for us.'
For Juste, each installation is a separate project, requiring the
co-ordination of numerous resources. As a small company, it was looking for
software that could handle tasks on its Macintosh network of eight SE30s,
LCs, and Mac IIx computers.
Juste looked at a couple of options, including an extension to the existing
Omnis database, and the acquisition of a sales and marketing system that
would track times and activities. Instead, Aaron Lubrani discovered (by
reading reviews in the Macintosh trade press), a piece of software called
CAT - Contacts Activities Times.
Although CAT does not use the traditional 'what if' analysis and Gantt
time-charts, it does overlap some of the functions of traditional project
management, and adds in facilities such as word processing for producing
time-stamped documents. These documents double as diary reminders: at time
of creation they can be scheduled to appear on the screen in a week's time,
a month, or whenever the next activity has to be triggered.
CATS also has facilities for scheduling activities and co-ordinating
resources.
Originally, it was bought as a stop-gap. But CAT quickly won in-house
approval as it enabled Juste's two full-time project managers to co-ordinate
all their activities. It also took care of complex paper requests to various
suppliers - 'the major benefit is that we cannot print or send a document
without a timeprint. We know what has happened when - and one thing we need
in our job is definitive proof that we have requested certain services on a
certain date.
'Once we had CAT installed, we realised how user-friendly it was: we didn't
want to be constantly training people. But there's also an amazing degree of
sophistication, in that it has grown with us.'
One of the main benefits, adds Mr Lubrani, is that the information built up
on each client during a project has been turned in to a client database
which is likely to have a secondary role in sales and marketing.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (7): Company gains
more time for better planning - Construction industry application / Asta's
'Powerproject'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the construction group Kyle Stewart, one of the benefits of using a
project management system has been 'more time thinking and planning more
productively,' according to the group's chief planner, Bob Reed.
He keeps a close eye on the market for software, and first spotted Asta's
Powerproject at an architectural RIBA exhibition in 1989.
A construction company which specialises in large and commercial buildings,
Kyle Stewart, part of the European HBG group, was no stranger to project
management systems, and the idea of acquiring PowerProject was to build an
integrated database consolidating all the cost and progress information on
PCs.
The package has now been in use for three and a half years, linked with the
Foxpro-based database which stores project costs.
Although PowerProject did not have all the features of a standard project
management system at the time, Bob Reed spotted its potential as an
easy-to-use tool for the planning engineers.
Now 14 of them use the software, entering details directly through the
screen. The output is mostly through Gantt-style time charts and precedence
diagrams, one of the advantages being the high quality of presentation
graphics. This is a valuable feature in the marketing phase of construction
projects.
The company now has an integrated system that covers every stage from tender
to commissioning, controlling all project data such as technical drawings,
and cost data. Kyle Stewart now uses the package all over Europe, and holds
ten product licences.
'It has improved our planning and made us more accurate,' says Mr Reed. The
chance he took on a relatively unknown product has paid off. Although the
software system may be viewed as a 'lightweight' by some in the construction
industry, full project management features are in development, and Kyle
Stewart is beta-testing updated releases of the software.
'I'm quite please with the way it's heading,' he adds.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (5): A finger on the
pulse - Instant analysis, How custom-built software links project
information, including materials and complex labour schedules, into an
accounting system / Case study of The Welding Institute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS rare to find an organisation like the Welding Institute which can
justify creating its own custom-built project management system. TWI is
itself one big project, a private limited company and non-profit-making
organisation which specialises in research on welding and joining materials.
It was formed by international collaboration between such manufacturers as
Shell, BA, Jaguar, and the Royal Ordnance. TWI organises between 600 and 700
separate consulting projects annually, including work for international
research projects (Eureka, Esprit) and the Department of Trade and Industry.
Its turnover of Pounds 18m comes largely from project sponsorship, through
its member companies, and partly through fixed-price contracts. Of a staff
of 420, there are over 200 professional scientists, engineers, material
scientists, and mathematicians who are likely to be involved in a number of
projects at any one time, and need to do a great deal of reporting-back.
People who might be world experts in their field are managing four or five
projects at once. The fixed-price nature of the projects makes
time-accounting important, and Ian Smith, commercial manager, makes a useful
between project management and project control.
'It's a matter of size. If one person can keep the whole picture of the
project in his head, and simply need a picture of costs that are mounting
up, that's part of project control. That includes telling the client what
you're doing, proposals, instructions, contracts, costing and estimating,'
says Ian Smith.
'There's a need for weekly feedback on costs, but only one person might know
about technical progress. Project management is what is needed for things
like NASA's space shuttle, which is simply too big for one person to keep
control, or keep tabs on contractors. 'The present batch of products on the
marketplace is really designed for projects such as building the Channel
Tunnel, where the problem is scheduling certain resources at a certain
point, at a particular time.'
In 1990, TWI was unable to find anything ready-made to manage project cash
as well as project scheduling. For smaller project work, individual TWI
researchers use Superproject Expert from Computer Associates. But TWI wanted
something which would link all project-costing information, including
materials, labour and so on, into an accounting system. There was a need to
provide information for use outside TWI as well as inside - 'one of our
functions is to act as a centre for all our members. We're geared up to
showing people exactly what we're doing,' says Ian Smith.
CMG (Computer Management Group) won a competitive tender to provide the CMG:
Fact2000 accounting suite, plus a custom-built project-costing system,
written using the Oracle database. The Project Control and Costing system
feeds information such as purchase orders for materials for a specific
project automatically through to Fact2000. This enables TWI to account by
project.
The system runs on a Prime EXL under SCO Unix, supporting two dozen or so
users, and is also being put onto an IBM PS/2. The entire installation,
including hardware, package, consultancy and the custom-built project
management module, carried a Pounds 100,000 price tag.
It was the analysis of instant information that was lacking from the
Fortran-built database which Mr Smith had previously built for his own
in-house use. This provided a useful prototype in commissioning the CMG
system.
Since its implementation, Mr Smith has written his own little 'management
summary system' using summary reports to analyse various aspects of the
project work. He also makes great use of ad hoc reports, and uses files of
data to analyse further using Lotus 1-2-3.
Choosing a partner was a matter of 'feeling comfortable' with the developer,
says Mr Smith. The system has now become a joint venture between CMG and
TWI, so that TWI receives royalty benefits.
The system has also had wider benefits, he says - 'if you think of
everything as a project, including administrative events like sickness and
holidays, everything becomes easy, because you always have your finger on
the pulse.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (3): Flying in tight
formation - Air Fleet application
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT a time when many airlines are shrinking, Britannia, the biggest charter
airline in the world, is taking on a new fleet. The project of commissioning
new aircraft involves every aspect of the company's operations: engineering,
flight operations, catering, cabin services, and training.
It was the need to involve so many people in many different tasks that
triggered off the acquisition of a PC-based project management system,
Hoskyns PMW (Project Manager Workbench).
Capt Paul Watson, fleet captain of both the 757 and 767 Airbuses, was
designated project manager, somewhat to his own surprise, as he had no
project management background. He is a working pilot, whose tasks include
flying the new aircraft back from Seattle. With the help of Hoskyns - which
was already working at Britannia on its strategic CORE system for crew and
aircraft planning - Capt Watson decided on a PC-based solution late in 1990
to help him co-ordinate the resources.
His project was to the introduction of an entire fleet over three years. By
summer 1994, Britannia will have 14 new 757 Airbuses. The company caters for
the charter package holiday market, which has continued to expand even
during the recession: Britannia made profits of Pounds 28.7m on a turnover
of Pounds 471.9m in 1991.
The 757 and 767 models are so similar in cockpit design that some of the
tasks can be duplicated for the introduction of both. But back in 1990, the
commissioning of the very first five 757s was done within a very tight
nine-month timescale. The craft had to be in operation by summer 1991, and
that affected everyone in the whole airline.
To meet the deadline, Capt Watson first marshalled his resources, and the
first step was to sit down with a Hoskyns project management consultant, to
do a 'project definition.'
'I found this an interesting exercise, as it is in the very nature of our
business to use highly disciplined techniques. Good safety is good business
for us, and with high capital investment, you must be able to analyse why
you are doing something, how you are doing it, who needs to be involved, and
how much it is going to cost.
'Where PMW came in was in deciding what degree of control you need,' says
Capt Watson.
In the early phases, choosing the exact specification from the 3 ins-thick
book of options was a complex task. In providing its 'Royal Class' service
in long and short-haul flights, Britannia needs a high standard in such
things as the cabin-trim: handicap-assist rails and nappy-changing
facilities in the lavatories, video entertainment for all passengers, and a
galley to support hot-food service.
'The complete exercise touched everyone in the airline, and we had to have
the specification definition done by the right time, which meant everyone
had to feed back their requirements,' explains Capt. Watson.
He put together a team of eight people, middle managers in flight
operations, engineering, customer services, ground operations, pilot
training, liaison and finance, helped by the Hoskyns project management
consultant. Although he did not use many of the traditional PM techniques
apart from Gantt charts (a way of showing project activities as bars on a
time chart),the PMW software gave Capt Watson 'the big picture.'
'If I could turn the clock back, I would have used critical-path analysis:
it would have been time well spent, although then, it seemed that we didn't
have the time to invest in the learning curve,' he comments. Nevertheless,
the Gantt chart produced at every meeting focused people's minds.
'A visible piece of paper was the focus of attention. It helped us keep
project meetings short and to the point, made sure that we didn't get
sidetracked and spend hours on things that could be sorted out by a couple
of individual team members outside the meeting.
'Within hours I'd update the activity plan and certainly by the next working
day, people had the next week's Gantt chart.'
Although PMW remains 'in the toolkit,' it is no longer in active use, and
the project management role, following the 1990-91 rush, has passed into
other hands. By contrast the team itself has remained in place, because it
proved to be such a useful mechanism for dealing with other issues that
arose, such as re-organising seating plans.
'I know that I can pick up the phone and get something dealt with by the
right person,' explains Capt Watson. 'It gives me a high degree of
confidence that things will get done the way I want them to be, because we
all talk the same language.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Survey of Software at Work, Spring 1993 (2): Every project
tells a story - By failing to plan, many managers are planning to fail / A
look at the importance of project management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLAIRE GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY PROJECT, like a story, has a beginning, a middle, and an end. Geoff
Reiss, in his entertaining book, Project Management Demystified, gives a
simple definition: 'A project is a human activity that achieves a clear
objective against a time scale.'
According to Jim Mackay, the large projects adviser at CMG, there are three
common ingredients to every project: its transient nature, the need to build
and motivate a team, and the fact that at the end of the day, that team will
be disbanded.
'Project management is by definition concerned with the management of
change,' he says. 'Any project needs to balance three elements: time-scales,
cost and quality: these could apply to anything from building the channel
tunnel to mounting a play.'
The Project Managers' Association, set up 25 years ago, grew from the
construction industry, which now only accounts for 40 per cent of its
members: another 40 per cent are in information technology (IT). The group
is working on a certification process for project managers.
The publication, Project Management Today, which regularly reviews software
packages in depth, suggests a broader scope, with readers in IT, finance,
pharmaceuticals, food, and aerospace, as well as civil engineering. The
scope of project management (PM) packages is widening in tune with this
development. According to the US Software Publishing Association, there was
a 63 per cent growth in PM software sales 1991-92.
At a time when computer shows are failing, 'Project Management 93,' (March
23-24), has increased its floorspace at the Novotel, Hammersmith. As the
following selection of stories shows, there is a wide variety of
applications, and at the lower PC and Mac end of the marketplace, user
friendliness is more important than some traditional PM features. Tony
Brady, program manager for Microsoft's Project (see Oxford Training story,
page 10) had the job of 'localising' Project for worldwide use. Project is
thought to have about half the PC PM marketplace, and 70 per cent of
Windows-based market.
Tony Brady sees the typical Project user as a mid-range professional with
100-200 tasks to manage - 'Some people do use it daily, but the tremendous
growth potential is in helping people who need something occasionally to
help plan their work.'
For that reason Brady concentrated on integrating Project with other
applications, such as electronic mail, and on making it user friendly.
It is surprising how few companies interviewed used electronic mail or
'groupware' as an integral part of their communications. Clive Holtham,
professor of Information Management at the City University Business School
and author of a report on workgroups, sees this area as a threat to
traditional vendors.
'The emerging generation of groupware applications could threaten them,
because it's a better overall fit to the complex business of project
management.'
'Attack the risks before they attack you,' sums up the motivation for most
people using PM packages. But consultant Noel Eden has developed a
non-computerised project management, called Risk Analysis Methodology.
Packages, he says, are not always the answer because they do not adapt to
experience. Geoff Reiss, who is directing a series of seminars at the PM 93
exhibition, hopes to convince senior managers of the need to use scheduling
techniques - 'by failing to plan, so many of them are planning to fail,' he
says.

The following is a list of project management buzzwords:
Project management (PM) software is used to schedule resources to achieve an
objective within set time-scales, quality, and cost. Graphics are an
important element in showing members of the team their responsibilities and
how they interact with others.
Gantt charts: originated by Henri Gantt in France at the start of the
century, the Gantt chart provides a pictorial representation of the start
and finish of various activities on a project and how they overlap.
'Gantts,' as they are called, do not show specific dependencies, but they
provide a framework for timescale.
Network diagram, on the other hand is a generic term encompassing critical
path analysis, Pert, (project evaluation and review technique), and critical
path method logic. A network diagram shows main activities and dependencies,
although not necessarily on a timescale.
There are two main methods: activity on arrow, (connecting nodes which
denote events) and precedence, using boxes to denote activities and arrows
to denote dependencies. The resource profile estimates resources plotted to
a timescale.
Critical path analysis - cpa - defines those activities which if delayed,
cause a knock-on effect, delaying the entire project. Others not on the
critical path carry some 'float' or 'slack' meaning that they can be started
later without impacting the overall timescale. For example, the critical
path for office block is design and installation of lifts; in aircraft
design it's the undercarriage.
Auto-scheduling allows the software-users to take all activities and
resources and automatically plot them on a timescale to produce a Gantt
chart, defining start and end dates. (A dangerous facility in which to place
too much faith, say some).
Time collection: a process of collecting and analysing time-sheets for
accurate project control (monitoring of progress) and cost-control. The
process can be speeded by networking and 'forms' facilities, either on paper
or via electronic mail. It is often integrated with accounting to bill for
the work, translating effort into cost.
Risk management - there are qualitative and quantitive methods for analysis
and management of risks in projects, such as the use of unfamiliar
technology.
This is usually part of an integrated quality plan.

exorbitantly so compared with the US, is not news. It is not even
controversial; in free markets, suppliers are at liberty to charge whatever
price they like and competition is presumed to act as the universal
leveller. What is surprising is the seeming acquiescence of European
customers who, knowing that the prices they are being charged are far higher
than can be accounted for by distribution, insurance and the costs of doing
business in Europe, pay up regardless.
The US magazine Information Week has been at the forefront of a campaign to
expose the cost differentials that exist. Research published in its December
1992 issue suggests that on average buyers in the UK pay about half as much
again for their software as their US competitors; French computer users are
the most exploited paying 1.8 times the US cost of a piece of software. So,
for example, Lotus 1-2-3 selling for Dollars 495 in the US, costs Dollars
752 in the UK, Dollars 821 in Germany and Dollars 1006 in France.
'It is not just mass-market pc software' the magazine observed. 'Enterprise
software, networking software, even Unix software such as the Informix
relational database, are subject to the European premium'.
Does it matter? The lack of any great public agitation about the issue would
suggest computers users simply accept the differential as a fact of business
life. The hard truth, however, that the European software market is
dominated by US suppliers and that the position is unlikely to change much
in the future. Customers who pay too much for their software are putting
themselves at a disadvantage compared to their US competitors.
There are three reasons. First, information technology is accepted as
essential to efficient business but it may cost a company between one and
five per cent of its revenues. Paying over the odds for software simply adds
to the burden.
Second, most companies both here and in the US have some way to go in
learning how best to use their information technology (IT); if software
costs are a barrier to software purchase, the company is giving up a place
on learning curve it may find difficult to reclaim. It is a common complaint
among hardware suppliers that 'intelligent' customers willing to make bold
and imaginative use of IT are scarce in Europe; high software prices are no
incentive for change.
Third, highly priced software increases the temptation to illegally copy
programs. This practice has been widespread in Europe in large and small
companies. It is now being curbed thanks to the efforts of the Business
Software Alliance which has resolutely pursued firms it suspects of
cheating, taking court action where necessary to ensure compliance with the
law.
WHAT is a fair price in Europe for US software ? Whatever the market will
bear, is the cynical response but most buyers and sellers agree the premium
for doing business in Europe should be a surcharge of no more than 10 to 30
per cent of the US price.
Social costs - salaries and benefits - for example, are higher in Europe
than in the US. There are heavy costs associated with translating a product
for each of Europe's diverse national markets which can be equivalent to the
cost of developing a new package from scratch. And there are marketing and
currency exchange costs to be reckoned with. There has been, nevertheless,
tremendous growth in the packaged software market in the past year. The
latest UK figures from the marketing consultancy Romtec suggests that 1992
sales for all packaged applications were 43 per cent up on 1991. Graphics
led the way with 86 per cent growth over 1991, but established applications
like word processing and spreadsheets are still showing growth rates of over
40 per cent.
Some portion of this must be due to customers switching from DOS-based
applications to Microsoft's Windows. Microsoft and Lotus have also
stimulated the market by bundling together several of their most popular
programs in suites selling for a large discount on the sum cost of the
individual programs. Microsoft, for example, sells its Office suite for
Pounds 575; the individual packages, Word, Excel and Powerplus, cost Pounds
395 each if sold separately.
THERE are some sound reasons why European customers seem to be accepting the
situation without a fight. In the first place, analyses like that carried
out by Information Week tend to rely on suppliers' retail list prices.
Street prices may be very different - perhaps as much as 30 per cent to 40
per cent below list.
Second, larger customers have the muscle to strike advantageous deals with
their suppliers - discounts for quantity, multiple-site licences and so on.
Third, even smaller customers can strike worthwhile bargains by shopping
around.
The fact remains, nevertheless, that Europeans are paying too much for their
software. The chief barrier to change seems to be that customers have few or
no levers to exert pressure on suppliers. There are a number of
self-interest groups like the Computer Users of Europe, established to lobby
Brussels and the European Parliament on behalf of customers during a
squabble over software protection last year which seemed to pose a threat to
the open systems movement. It is well aware of the problem but so far is
still considering what approaches would be most appropriate.
The problem may be well on the way to solving itself. The accelerating pace
of globalisation in the computer industry is already creating strong
pressures for a convergence of prices world-wide. In this issue of Software
at Work there are examples of companies including Rockwell Graphics and
British Telecom which are sourcing their project management software
globally.
Companies of this size and market muscle will not be prepared to buy at
different prices in different territories. For the moment, though, unless
Europe's users can organise themselves to bring pressure to bear on
suppliers, they will continue to pay over the odds for their software.

FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rolls-Royce worries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A bout of nervous selling hit Rolls-Royce, the aero-engine and industrial
power group, on reports that the company will announce job cuts of as many
as 5,000, against previous estimates of under 3,000, when it reports figures
today.
Analysts were concerned that such a move would result in a higher level of
provisions against the 1992 results, suggesting that profits may fall below
the Pounds 50m predicted by the more pessimistic researchers. The shares
weakened 6 to 129p in trade of 4.2m, with analysts still expecting the
company to announce a cut in the dividend.
A further blow to sentiment came from news that airliner China Southern had
placed an engine order with Rolls-Royce rival General Electric for engines
to power its new Boeing 777 aircrafts, an order many had expected
Rolls-Royce to win.
A Pounds 26m provision for losses incurred by Willis Corroon's Sovereign
Marine &amp; General subsidiary, and to a lesser extent the halved quarterly
dividend, at first triggered a big slide in the stock, although it later
rallied to end a busy session only marginally easier. At their worst the
shares touched 178p; they closed a net 2 off at 190p after turnover of 3m.
Mr Nick Bunker, insurance broking analyst at Hoare Govett, said: 'As a
broker, Willis is as well placed as any of its peers, but the Sovereign
losses are a potent reminder of the snares that lie in wait for the unwary
marine underwriter.' Hoare is sticking with its 1993 forecast of Pounds 72m.
Barclays Bank eased 2 more to 411p on 5.3m traded and National Westminster
lost 3 to 444p on 3.1m as institutions continued to switch into stocks such
as Lloyds, slightly higher at 557p. HSBC rose 9 to 563p, also helped by
switching.
Sun Alliance was the pick of the composite insurance sector, adding 4 at
346p on very heavy turnover of 5.8m. BZW reduced its estimate of 1992 losses
from Pounds 155m to Pounds 100m, with Mr Trevor May, composites analyst at
BZW, citing the speed of recovery in UK underwriting, as evidenced by
Guardian Royal's good results, for the change in his forecast.
Oil group Lasmo met selling, losing 3 to 187p on very heavy turnover of 10m,
with one securities house said to have unloaded a block of 3m shares at
187p. Lasmo's preliminary figures are due on March 24.
Lasmo shares have fared badly compared with those of Enterprise Oil, its
closest rival in the exploration and production sub-sector.
Enterprise, boosted on Tuesday by news of its participation in a substantial
oil find in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea, edged up to 508p in spite
of news that Norwich Union, one of the UK's biggest institutional holders of
oil shares, has reduced its stake in the company over the past year from
7.98 per cent to 6.99 per cent, via the sale of more than 3m shares.
Enterprise reports preliminary figures this morning.
Renewed confidence for the current year lifted Vickers, which reported
losses worse than market forecasts but a Pounds 60.5m rights issue lower
than predicted. The shares gained 6 at 124p.
Confirmation of a significant order from Rank Xerox boosted Tadpole
Technology, which climbed 9 to 329p.
Suggestions that British Aerospace would soon announce an order for Hawk
aircraft saw the shares move 8 ahead to 280p. Another firm expecting a big
order was Westland Group, currently visiting Scottish institutions. The
shares firmed 4 to 169p.
A sharp rise in profits and an increase in the dividend at BAT Industries
cheered the market and the shares moved 18 ahead to 955p.
International conglomerate Hanson gave up 3 to 254p, after SG Warburg was
said to have changed its recommendation from a hold to a sell. Turnover was
8.2m.
Results from Medeva were well received, the shares appreciating 10 to 235p.
Nikko Securities is forecasting an upside of 300p on a six-month view.
Good results from Cadbury-Schweppes sent the shares racing forward, closing
14 ahead at 508p. A series of upgrades by analysts followed, with Nomura
lifting its forecast from Pounds 370m to Pounds 400m, although the house
remains cautious over earnings growth and the premium rating.
Smith New Court raised its forecast from Pounds 375m to Pounds 395m and
retained its recommendation, the broker arguing that although the shares may
not outperform in the near term, the stock remained a good longer term
investment.
Banana importer Geest was the subject of some takeover speculation as the
shares continued their recent upward surge. US food outfits Dole Group and
Chiquitta were being mentioned. Geest is a beneficiary of an EC banana
agreement which comes into effect in July. The shares advanced 8 to 474p.
Asda anticipated the announcement of its impending inclusion in the FT-SE
100 Index, the shares continuing their good run, closing 2 1/4 higher at
72p. Turnover was a combined 55m shares.

FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Standard volatile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A turbulent session in Standard Chartered saw the bank's shares tumble on
the revelation of much greater provisions than expected for losses in the
Indian stock market. However, the shares staged a remarkable rally which
left them at their best level since the market crash of October 1987.
Activity was the second highest since turnover records were first logged, at
the time of Big Bang in late 1986. Some 12m shares changed hands yesterday,
second only to the 48m traded on June 19, 1989, when Cazenove placed Sir YK
Pao's 10 per cent stake.
However, the start of trading saw Standard shares drop to 659p following the
figures which included a shocking Pounds 272m provision against losses in
the Indian stock market, well above most analysts' estimates. But further
examination of the results, revealing strong underlying profits, and also
the opportunity to grill the directors at the post-figures meeting, brought
a reassessment and subsequent flurry of profits upgradings by analysts.
By the close the shares had jumped to finish a net 25 up at 716p. Mr Derek
Chambers at Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken lifted his current year forecast to Pounds
350m and told clients to 'buy on weakness'. He underlined the good
underlying profits performance and the fact that Standard's record indicates
that some release of loss provisions is more likely than further increases.
Lehman Brothers moved their current year estimate up to Pounds 400m and
highlighted the bank's dividend potential.

FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy pressure on Bass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALK OF further downgrades following presentations by the company sent Bass
tumbling and pulled down other brewing and hotel groups in its wake.
Analysts said worries over trading at Holiday Inns, particularly in
continental Europe, had been raised at the meetings. Domestic brewing
margins were also said to be under pressure as Bass responded to an
aggressive push for market share by Courage.
Other concerns highlighted by analysts included higher than expected
interest charges, and margins on soft drinks following an increase in sugar
prices. After James Capel's downgrade on Monday, yesterday saw UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew snipping its forecasts and a number of other houses ready to follow
suit.
However, while weakness is seen in the short term domestic brewing market,
many analysts still regard Bass as a positive long term investment. The
shares closed 10 adrift at 583p after turnover of 4.2m.
The bearish news on Bass dragged on other domestic drinks stocks. Whitbread
'A' declined 7 to 481p and Scottish &amp; Newcastle 3 to 462p.
Queens Moat Houses, which has franchises for some Holiday Inns, dipped 3 to
47p in heavy volume of 6.6m. The stock was also disturbed by a negative note
from NatWest Securities which suggested that the hotel group may be
adversely affected by the new accounting procedures.

FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Steady close after an erratic session
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITY analysts took a generally favourable view of trading figures announced
yesterday by several leading British companies, and the stock market closed
firmly after a session overshadowed by caution ahead of next week's UK
Budget. The final hour of business saw shares moving ahead in spite of a
dull start in New York, where the Dow Industrial Average was 12 points off
in London trading hours. A new cut in repurchase rates by the Bundesbank
encouraged UK investors.
The FT-SE 100 Index traced an erratic pattern, with a fall of 5.5 points
transformed into a net gain of nearly 12 by mid-morning. With most of the
day's list of company results then in the market, share prices moved around
overnight levels, losing heart for a while before turning upwards again at
the close.
The final reading showed the FT-SE 100 at 2,956.7 for a rise of 6.8. Chart
specialists were happy to see the 2,850 line held but sounded a little less
confident that the 3,000 mark can be attained before the UK chancellor
delivers his Budget on Tuesday.
Trading volumes remained high, although the day's Seaq-reported total of
686.2m shares contrasted with 783.1m on Tuesday, when retail business was
worth Pounds 1.53bn. Non-Footsie business returned to more average levels
yesterday, at around 63 per cent of overall trading. However, the FT-SE Mid
250 Index slipped by 1.4 to 3,117.8.
The search for further signs of economic recovery found some encouragement
from company reports. Both BAT Industries and Cadbury-Schweppes did well
after profits announcements. The stock market is now scanning company
statements eagerly and, although prepared to be told that profits were hard
to make last year, responds readily to indications that the clouds are
lifting.
Vickers, the defence and luxury car manufacturer, gained ground following
results and news of a Pounds 60.5m rights issue. The much-heralded flow of
rights issues has, so far, proved less threatening for share prices than was
feared only two weeks ago.
Reductions in some interest rates in Belgium and the Netherlands also
encouraged investors, but suggestions that the Bundesbank might make a
further move downwards found little credence among London strategists.
Both marketmaking firms and fund managers have begun to consolidate trading
positions ahead of the UK Budget. Analysts are in general agreement that the
chancellor will disclose some fiscal tightening measures.
Some believe that the apparent fragility of the economic recovery will keep
such tightening to a minimum, and are of the view that harder measures may
be held back until December. However, the market is counting on a further
cut in base rates, if not on Budget Day, then very soon afterwards. Another
firm performance by sterling yesterday buttressed confidence in the City's
expectations of a Budget rate cut.
The London Stock Exchange announced yesterday that, following the quarterly
review of components of the FT-SE 100-share Index, Asda will join the index
and WH Smith will be removed. Further details of changes in market indices
are shown on Page 26.

FT  11 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DERIVATIVES sector had a volatile session, with traders becoming more
cautious ahead of next week's UK Budget, writes Joel Kibazo.
In futures, the March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index opened 5 points below
Tuesday's close at 2,954, suggesting a quiet session. However, early buyers
of the contract, shortly after the opening, sent March ahead and by 10am it
was trading at 2,973.
But there was no follow-through buying after that and the contract drifted
down on sporadic selling and programme trading, which saw it fall to 2,954
over the lunchtime period.
With traders cheered by a cut in rates in Belgium, March ignored the early
retreat on Wall Street in the afternoon and recovered some of the ground
lost earlier in the day.
March closed at 2,958, just below the previous day's finish and slightly
ahead of its estimated fair value premium to cash of around minus 2, with
turnover uninspiring at 7,978.
In traded options, total volume reached 30,193 contracts, with the FT-SE 100
option trading 9,147 lots. Two-way business in the Euro FT-SE 100 option saw
turnover in that stock reach 3,347.
Asda led the way among the stock options, with 2,419 lots dealt and the
April 57 calls the busiest. It was followed by Barclays at 1,921 and BP at
1,656. Rolls-Royce, which reports figures today, traded 1,333 contracts.

FT  11 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): New Dow record after early
fall is reversed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER running into early profit-taking yesterday, US stock markets regained
their poise thanks to a late surge of buying, which lifted indices to new
highs, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a net 6.22 up at 3,478.34, a record
and well above its low for the day of 3,449.43. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
ended 1.93 higher at 456.33, while the American SE composite added 2.86 at
421.88 and the Nasdaq composite firmed 3.91 to 692.87. New York SE trading
volume was 256m shares and rises outnumbered falls by 1,039 to 828.
After reaching record levels during the first two days of the week, stock
prices were hit by concerted selling when the market opened. Traders
reported that an early decline in bond prices triggered the sell-off,
although the likely motive was an eagerness among investors to book some of
the profits earned earlier in the week. Among the selling a number of
sizeable program trades were spotted.
Prices steadily recovered during the afternoon, culminating in a late rush
of buying that pushed stocks into positive territory only in the final 30
minutes of trading.
No important new economic figures were released yesterday, although the
Federal Reserve's 'Beige Book' report on the state of the economy nationwide
showed that business activity continued to pick up in the first two months
of the year, in spite of sluggish loan demand and continued weakness in some
regional economies.
Walt Disney was one of the most heavily traded issues, slipping Dollars  1/2
to Dollars 45 after a seller offloaded at Dollars 44 a large block of shares
 -2.8m in all. There was no indication as to who had sold the stake, or why.
Drug shares were in demand as investors searched for bargains in a sector
which has been hit hard recently by speculation that President Clinton plans
to impose price controls on pharmaceutical products as part of his
healthcare reforms. Merck improved Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 40 in volume of
3.9m shares, Pfizer Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 63 1/4 , Schering-Plough
Dollars 2 to Dollars 61 1/2 , Bristol-Myers Squibb Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars
58 1/2 and Glaxo Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 19 7/8 .
News that Primerica is negotiating to buy the Shearson brokerage business
from American Express continued to boost the financial services group's
stock. Primerica was up Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 46 5/8 in volume of more
than 1m shares. American Express shed Dollars 3/4 to Dollars 27 1/8 , having
originally risen on news of the proposed deal.
Genesis Health moved ahead Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 14 3/4 after an analyst
at securities house Merrill Lynch raised the firm's short-term rating on the
stock from 'above average' to 'buy' and named the company its pick of the
week.
On the Nasdaq market, Biosurface Technologies plunged Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 6 after the company revealed that it had suspended a clinical trial
of its Anticel product, a dressing used for donor site wounds.
Canada
THE TORONTO market closed narrowly mixed after further heavy trading. The
TSE 300 index was off 1.2 at 3,552.0 but advancing issues led declines by
350 to 321. Volume amounted to 52.5m shares valued at some CDollars 530m.
Eight of the 14 sub-group indices were lower, led by golds, down 1.1 per
cent as the spot price for gold in New York eased 30 cents to a seven-year
low of USDollars 326.55. The media group advanced 1.4 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Politics, economics raise Hong Kong to
new peaks / Analysis of a resurgent equity boom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week, Hong Kong has consolidated the irresistible rise which, since the
beginning of 1992, has made it the best performing major stock market in the
world.
Yesterday's marginal fall in the blue chip Hang Seng index of 19.54, or 0.3
per cent, to 6,488.46 left it 23 points off the day's peak, but this
followed three record highs for the market in four trading days.
Brokers have dusted off year-end forecasts which, because of the political
woes then besetting the colony, had been in abeyance since the beginning of
1993. They are now looking at a year-end level of 7,500 to 8,000 for the
Hang Seng index.
What a difference a few months can make. At the start of December, the
overwhelming mood was to sell Hong Kong. China had threatened the safety of
business contracts which span Hong Kong's reversion to Chinese sovereignty
in 1997; on December 3 the market plunged 8 per cent. The Hang Seng index
now stands 30 per cent higher.
Short memories are part of the lore of the Hong Kong market. But,
paradoxically, the most accurate assessment during those dark days came from
the unlikeliest of quarters: Governor Chris Patten, the man whose
'democracy' proposals so upset China, and the man financial markets like to
hate most. The governor said that few made money selling Hong Kong short.
So what has changed? Has the market's recent performance been a reassertion
of economics over politics? Or has the recent thaw in Anglo-Chinese
relations been the motive force behind the market's relentless upward move?
As with most things in life, it is a bit of both. Even to the most
unreconstructed bull it seems unlikely that the Hong Kong market could have
risen so strongly had China not decided to come back to the negotiating
table about the colony's political development.
The market senses an Anglo-Chinese deal in the making and, although it could
yet be disappointed, it has decided that the element of political risk has
lessened considerably. And it has put its money where its judgment lies.
Four months ago, the market was trading on a prospective p/e of just above 8
times 1993 earnings; the multiple is now more than 11 - close to the upper
end of its traditional prospective p/e range of 8 to 13.
There is also evidence in plenty for the economic approach. China's economy
expanded by nearly 13 per cent in real terms last year, and the region
closest to Hong Kong, namely Guangdong province, by much more than that. The
growth rate may slow this year but that is being taken as a reassuring sign
by the market, which fears a re-run of 1988/89 when China's government
screwed down the economy too hard.
As for Hong Kong, it grew by 5 per cent last year. The government thinks
that growth will accelerate to 5.5 per cent this year, while many private
forecasters plump for 6 per cent. Corporate earnings reports have also been
encouraging.
The initial clutch of results have underlined the profitability of banking.
The banks - and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking is still to come - have
reported earnings growth of 30 to 40 per cent.
Analysts also note other positive factors. There is a growing recognition
that the US yield curve is likely to remain flat this year. As Hong Kong's
interest rates are tied to US rates, by virtue of the colony's currency link
with America, domestic rates are expected to remain at their currently low
level of 6.5 per cent.
With the results season only half way spent, the possibility for upsets
remains. The conglomerates - Jardine, Swire and Hutchison - are still to
come, as are the property developers. The outlook for these sectors is
mixed.
And then there is politics. In November, as the market rose in defiance of
China's attacks on Mr Patten, there was a lot of talk about the decoupling
of politics from economic fundamentals. December gave the lie to that when
China decided it wanted the market lower. When Anglo-Chinese negotiations
about Hong Kong's politics finally get going, China may decide again that it
is in its interests for the market to fall.

FT  11 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Australia advances to an
eight-month high
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE buying by foreign investors supported share prices in the face of
profit-taking by investment trusts, and the Nikkei average finished narrowly
higher in heavy trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei gained 10.33 at 17,858.63 after registering a low for the day of
17,824.12 and high of 18,036.72. The index failed to stay above the 18,000
level due to profit-taking by investment trusts and corporate investors
eager to realise profits ahead of the March financial year-end.
Volume contracted to 550m shares from 853m. Declines finally led advances by
577 to 430, with 163 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks ended 2.11 up at 1,341.88, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
firmed 1.12 to 1,080.78.
Foreign investors were seen covering short positions. Traders said some US
pension funds were increasing their investments in Japanese shares, which
are seen as undervalued following the recent rallies in US and UK equities.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has led the recent market rally, met
profit-taking in early trading but was supported by dealers and finished
Y10,000 higher at Y790,000.
NEC appreciated Y10 to Y777 on hopes that the company will see a rise in
sales as a result of the government's promotion of optical fibre networks in
its infrastructure projects.
Reports that condominium sales were rising in the Tokyo metropolitan area
helped builders, with Daikyo, the leading property developer, advancing Y35
to Y995. Shokusan Jutaku Sogo rose Y11 to Y520 and Taisei Prefab
Construction Y50 to Y1,750. Some real estate companies were also higher,
Mitsui Fudosan putting on Y20 at Y1,070 and Tokyu Land Y22 at Y482.
Some high-technology exporters gained ground on the stronger dollar. Sony
rose Y30 to Y4,130 and Fujitsu Y17 to Y605. However, Hitachi lost Y7 to Y740
and Toshiba eased Y2 to Y588 on profit-taking.
Brokers moved ahead in the expectation that the recent market rally and rise
in trading volume will help revenues. Nomura Securities rose Y40 to Y1,640
and Nikko Y8 to Y713.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 27.90 to 18,765.54 in volume of 132.8m
shares. A retreat by railway issues depressed the index, and Shimano, the
bicycle parts maker, slipped Y200 to Y10,000.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets mostly set a positive tone. Seoul was closed for a
holiday.
AUSTRALIA closed at an eight-month peak, pushed up by strong futures buying.
On the Sydney Futures Exchange, the March Share Price Index jumped 22 to
1,669, moved by a feeling that the market would strengthen after Saturday's
federal election. The All Ordinaries index followed, finishing 13.8 higher
at 1,647.5. Turnover came to ADollars 325.8m.
The gold shares index defied the uptrend to lose 2.8 to 1,063.2 after
bullion prices hit a seven-year low overnight.
Among banks, NAB climbed 13 cents to ADollars 8.58 and Commonwealth advanced
9 cents to ADollars 7.49, but Westpac closed only a cent higher at ADollars
3.20 after Tuesday's unveiling of its first foreign rationalisation plans
under its new managing director, Mr Robert Joss.
BANGKOK's SET index rose 16.36, or 1.9 per cent, to 900.07 in a technical
rebound from recent declines. Turnover was still relatively low, although up
from Bt2.5bn to Bt3.5bn.
Banking stocks were among the major gainers, Bangkok Bank, the most active
issue in turnover terms, firming Bt4 to Bt119. Industrial Finance Corp of
Thailand moved forward Bt24 to Bt362 on details of plans to rescue the
failed First City Investment.
SINGAPORE rose on last-minute buying, the Straits Times Industrial index
ending 10.24 better at 1,667.96. Trading interest in main board shares
continued to be meagre, with the focus on Malaysian over-the-counter stocks.
KUALA LUMPUR recovered from a bout of profit-taking to close mixed in heavy
trading. The KLSE composite index put on 5.58 at 637.37 on the back of the
market heavyweight, Telekom, 40 sen higher at MDollars 12.70.
JAKARTA remained in confident mood and the official index rose 1.70 to
311.78. Among active stocks, Pan Brothers added Rp150 at Rp2,375 but Lippo
dipped Rp50 to Rp3,325.
BOMBAY continued under pressure which left the BSE index down 49.81, or 2.1
per cent, at 2,287.15. As the market opened, the exchange halted trading in
17 group A shares to prevent more of the price swings seen on Tuesday.

FT  11 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Dutch rate cut provides some
support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST rate cuts by the Dutch and Belgium central banks gave some support
to late closing markets, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT showed midsession strength on firmer bond prices, the DAX index
registering an intraday high of 1,717.02, closed 3.45 lower at 1,709.68, but
regained some of its vigour in the post-bourse. Turnover eased from DM8.2bn
to DM7.8bn.
For a good part of the day, the market was dominated by chemicals where
Bayer dropped DM4.50 to DM277 ahead of today's dividend decision, and after
this week's dividend cuts from BASF and Hoechst.
BASF is paying DM1 more than expected, at DM10, and Hoechst DM1 less than
some analysts hoped at DM9. This suggested that investors had been taking a
simplistic view of dividend prospects for the sector, where dividend
decisions are taken by reference to earnings of the German parent company.
Bayer clawed back DM2 of its fall in the London afternoon, but Deutsche Bank
did better with a post-bourse close of DM728 against a session rise of
DM1.50 to DM723. Ms Barbara Schumacher, of Merck Fink in Dusseldorf, noted
that Deutsche was the laggard bank with a rise of just 20 per cent from its
low of last September, compared with a gain of 34 per cent for Commerzbank
over the same period.
AMSTERDAM was also interested in chemicals with DSM continuing to surprise.
The shares closed at a year's high, up Fl 4.90 or some 6 per cent at Fl
83.40, having gained 14 per cent since the group announced disappointing
1992 results last week. Some analysts commented that that the momentum in
the price may have begun with short covering while investors may be more
optimistic about long-term prospects. Akzo rose Fl 2.10 to Fl 154.50. The
CBS Tendency index put on 1.70 to finish at 105.40.
The rate cuts had been anticipated but financial stocks were nonetheless
given a late lift, with Aegon rising Fl 1.90 to Fl 89.30 and ABN Amro Fl
1.40 to Fl 55.40.
Hunter Douglas, Fl 2.60 stronger at Fl 42.50, was helped partly by relief
that the dividend was cut less than forecasts.
PARIS had been riding the 2,000 level until just before the close when
technical trading saw the CAC-40 index dip 17.20 to 1,992.42. Turnover was
some FFr3.4bn.
Lafarge pleased the market following better than expected 1992 results and
the shares moved FFr7.50 higher to FFr357.50, but off a day's high of
FFr364.90. Chargeurs gained FFr26 to FFr1,281 after announcing that it will
consolidate BSkyB in next year's results which may help it reduce its tax
charge.
BRUSSELS rose strongly anticipating the cut in interest rates which came
after the close and the Bel-20 index gained 11.59 to 1,247.71 in turnover of
some BFr2.1bn.
MILAN allowed the dust to settle on political events and shares picked up as
the market concentrated on today's options expiry and the end of the monthly
account next week. The Comit index rose 5.63 to 516.65.
Montedison, spurred by a newspaper report that the sale of its Erbamont
subsidiary to Sweden's Kabi Pharmacia was imminent, gained L32 to fix at
L1,297 before rising to L1,312 after hours - 3.7 per cent higher on the day.
Montedison's parent Ferruzzi denied that final terms were about to be
announced but confirmed that negotiations were at an advanced stage.
Blue chips picked up from some early declines after the Christian Democrats
promised to support Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. Fiat dipped L38 to fix at
L5,651 before bouncing back to L5,715 after hours.
ZURICH turned firmer after bargain hunters entered the market, lifting
cyclical stocks which had earlier suffered from profit-taking. The SMI index
rose 5.9 to 2,157.2.
Banks, however, were mostly easier after Swiss Bank announced results that
were below expectations and were unfavourably compared with the two other
leading banks which posted higher profits for 1992.
SBC and UBS were each SFr4 lower at SFr356 and SFr1,170 respectively but CS
Holding managed a SFr10 advance to SFr2,240.
STOCKHOLM saw a short-lived pre-lunch rally before prices settled back as
investors awaited a crop of company results, some expected to be gloomy,
today. The Affarsvarlden general index shed 5.2 to 1,033.7.
Hennes and Mauritz proved an exception, climbing SKr28 or 16 per cent to
SKr202 in brisk trade after Tuesday's 62 per cent profits growth.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Europe eases rates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM, the Netherlands and Denmark followed the latest round of monetary
easing by the Bundesbank with rate cuts of their own yesterday.
Denmark was the first to act. The central bank cut  1/2 point off its
two-week rate to 11 1/2 per cent, saying the move was made possible by
continued currency inflows, a strong krone and lower market rates.
Later in the day the Bundesbank gave further confirmation of the direction
in which its lending rates are going by reducing the lowest accepted rate on
its 28-day repo funds to 8.25 per cent.
The move followed a cut in the 14-day repo interest rate to 8.25 per cent on
Friday. Many saw yesterday's reduction as a clear signal that the German
central bank would lower its officially posted rates next week.
Not all, however, are convinced. Some analysts expect the German authorities
to wait until real progress has been made on the so-called Solidarity Pact
before bringing down official interest rates. In the meantime it will act to
ease strains in the European Monetary System by slicing repo rates.
The Belgian and Dutch rate cuts were widely expected, but the market was
pleasantly surprised by the extent of the reductions.
The Belgian central bank announced that it was cutting its discount rate by
25 basis points to 7.25 per cent and its key money market central interest
rate by 20 basis points to 8.10 per cent.
The Belgian authorities also cut their end-of-day rate to 9.10 from 9.30 per
cent but left the emergency lending rate, equivalent to Germany's Lombard
rate, unchanged at 9.75 per cent.
In the Netherlands, the Dutch central bank said it would cut its three
official interest rates by  1/4 percentage point and lower its special
advances money market rate to 8.10 per cent from 8.30 per cent. It reduced
the discount rate to 7.25 per cent from 7.50 per cent.
French franc and Euromark futures advanced strongly, although dealers
reported that prices were moving up before the announcements of the various
European rate cuts.
Interbank rates in the UK money markets barely changed in a dull day's
trading. Although conditions were tight at the start of the day, the
shortage was eventually relieved by late assistance from the Bank of
England.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Confidence vote buoys lira
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIRA recouped some of its losses yesterday after the government won a
vote of confidence in the Italian senate, and the Bank of Italy intervened
to support the currency, writes Emma Tucker.
A sense of relief on foreign exchange markets that Mr Giuliano Amato, the
Italian prime minister, was not going to resign helped push the lira back up
to around L961.8 to the D-Mark from a previous close of L964.5.
It now appears that Mr Amato will continue to head his government until an
election later this year, following April's referendum on changes to the
electoral system.
Mr Julian Jessop, international economist at Midland Global Markets, said
one of the biggest hurdles facing Italy between now and the election is a
possible downgrading of the country's credit ratings.
'This would lead to a flood of selling by US investment houses,' added Mr
Jessop.
Moody's Investor Services, the US international credit rating agency, has
already placed Italy's debt under review. Italy is currently rated by
Moody's as Aa3. According to Mr Jessop, a downgrading would prompt heavy
selling of Italian debt as many investment houses, particularly in the US,
are not allowed to hold debt below the Aa3 rating.
Further monetary easing in Germany would help Italy to avoid this situation,
he said. If the central bank were able to lower lending rates it would be
easier for the government to tighten fiscal policy and improve its standing
among international investors.
European exchange rate mechanism currencies were relatively stable
yesterday, even after three members took advantage of the opportunity
offered by the Bundesbank last week to cut interest rates. The Dutch,
Belgian and Danish central banks followed suit by reducing their lending
rates.
The Danish krone stood at DKr3.8360 per D-Mark in late European trade from
3.8335. The Belgian and Dutch currencies were barely changed from the
previous close.
The peseta suffered a setback in early trading. Some analysts said this
reflected growing expectations of a rate cut in Spain.
Interest rates in Spain are still at extremely high levels. Yesterday the
one-month interbank rate stood at 16 1/2 per cent. With the unemployment
rate above 20 per cent, the Spanish authorities are keen to ease monetary
conditions, and recent good inflation figures, together with the Bundesbank
easing, may have provided the ideal opportunity.
However, other factors militate against a rate cut. In particular the
Spanish government is nervous that some recent speculation against the
escudo could spread to the peseta.
The dollar was calm in the absence of any significant economic news, while
the pound drifted modestly lower ahead of next week's UK Budget. It closed
3/4 pfennig easier at DM2.3850.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Australian Wool Corporation's market indicator reached a new low for the
present selling season yesterday. It fell 11c to 453c a kg and is getting
closer to the low point, 428 reached in the week when free market conditions
returned after the collapse of the floor price in February, 1991. The latest
forecast for wool production this season is slightly higher than the
preceding estimate, and production next year is tentatively estimated at
only 5% lower. With consumption well down mainly because of Russia's
continuing and apparently indefinite absence from the market.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: EC urged to delay cut in milk
quotas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has recommended delaying the introduction of a 1 per
cent reduction in milk quotas because of falling butter consumption inside
the European Community.
The success of butter substitutes in grabbing market share has persuaded the
commission to support instead a 5 per cent cut in the intervention price for
butter from July 1 1993, Mr Rene Steichen, EC farm commissioner, said
yesterday.
The 1 per cent quota cut was agreed in principle last year as part of a
wide-ranging reform of the common agriculture policy which attempted to
reduce production.
The idea was to cut milk quotas by 2 per cent over two years starting April
1 1993. Now the commission will review the position next year, with the
possibility of a 2 per cent cut to compensate for this year's delay.
Separately, the commission has recommended granting Spain a provisional
increase of 500,000 tonnes in its present milk quota of 4.55m tonnes,
starting April 1 1993. But Greece and Italy will have to wait because the
commission is not satisfied with progress toward setting up a national
agency to ensure the quotas are respected by local producers.
Italy's excess milk production amounts to 2.47m tonnes, while its proposed
increase in the wholesale quota is 0.9m tonnes, the commission said. Greece
is due to benefit from a quota increase of 100,000 tonnes.
Greece and Italy have until May 15 to show they can meet the conditions set
out in CAP reform. By the end of July, both Mediterranean countries may be
allowed to increase guaranteed quantities of delivery for the 1993-4
marketing year, subject to review by the commission and approval by the
council of ministers.
Mr Steichen said the commission and council must be 100 per cent convinced
that the milk quota regime would be respected by all 12 member states.
'This is all the more important when the EC's agricultural policy is moving
further in the direction of production control,' he said.
The commission has approved the provision of DM4.45bn (Pounds 1.85bn)
national aid to German farmers to compensate for the revaluation of the
D-Mark in the 1980s. The Bonn government's aid scheme will continue until
the end of 1995, with payments ranging between DM1,00 and DM16,000 per farm.
The commission said the aid was temporary, and was necessary to avoid
serious harm to farmers' incomes in Germany.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Kalgoorlie celebrates the
centenary of Hannan's find - The chequered history and independent spirit of
Australia's wildest mining town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDEPENDENCE of spirit that made Kagloorlie in Western Australia one of
the world's most famous mining towns remains as fervent as ever.
Tired of the long wait for the state government to build a by-pass to take
the heavy construction equipment used in the gold fields around the town
instead of through it, a group of townspeople last year built one themselves
 -state bureaucrats are still scratching their heads and wondering if they
can declare the new road illegal.
Kalgoorlie today is in celebratory mood. One hundred years ago an Irishman
called Paddy Hannan found a gold nugget in the desert and started the
Western Australian gold rush, which brought gold hunters flocking to the
town. Although Mr Hannan's luck rapidly ran out and he died in 1929 in
relative poverty, he is still fondly remembered in Kalgoorlie where the main
street is named after him and a bronze life-sized statue reminds visitors of
the part he played in developing Australia's gold industry, now the third
largest in the world.
The town's streets remain as extraordinarily wide today as at Hannan's time,
designed that way so that the camel trains that brought supplies to the town
could turn easily. When trucks replaced the camels the animals were set free
in the desert and quickly adapted to their new environment.
'Kalgoorlie is where you really feel isolated from the rest of Australia,'
says Mr Ross Kennedy, managing director of Resolute Resources, a small gold
mining company. 'It is a place where you can drink for 24 hours a day,
gamble for 24 hours a day, screw for 24 hours a day or go to church for 24
hours a day. That's democracy. It also makes the town virtually crime free.'
Paddy Hannan's find in 1893 attracted people from all over the world to this
remote territory, helping to bring economic development to Western
Australia, which still has fewer than 2m people in an area five times the
size of France.
The town's massive cemetery is a stark reminder of the hard times faced by
the earliest inhabitants or 'diggers'. Water was scarce (and still is),
sanitation was absent and disease rife. In this area there are no beaches
and no mountains - just red dirt, heat, flies, gold and nickel.
The town is also a notorious example of what damage unthinking miners can do
to the environment. Before Kalgoorlie started to clean itself up six years
ago and move its smelters out of town, the countryside looked, according to
one executive, 'like Hiroshima after the bomb'. Miners had denuded the land
of trees for miles around and a smelter next to the mine on the town's edge
belched out all sorts of nasty substances into the lungs of miners'
families, including high concentrations of sulphur dioxide. Not only has the
smelter been moved but a five-year project was started in 1989 to re-treat
the old waste dumps on the town's doorstep to get out the remaining gold and
move them further away.
'Sure you could smell the sulphur dioxide in the air as you approached
Kalgoorlie,' one mining engineer recalls. 'But the town had all the sporting
facilities you could want and 29 pubs - what more could you ask for.'
Kalgoorlie dealt more successfully with other mining town problems. Although
prostitution is illegal in Western Australia Kalgoorlie's Hay Street is
renowned for its well-managed brothels or 'traps'. One madame sponsored the
local football team and one of the players recalls that 'there was never any
recruiting problems because there were special prizes for successful players
at the end of the season'.
Hannan Street leads to the waste dumps and beyond them the Golden Mile, an
area of one square mile, the heart of a mining camp that so far has produced
more than 1,300 tonnes of gold or 42m troy ounces, worth about ADollars 20bn
(Pounds 9.7bn) at today's prices.
Like most mining towns, Kalgoorlie has had its downs as well as its ups. For
80 years the Golden Mile housed a huge number of underground mines, often
going deep underground and where labour-intensive methods were needed to
extract the gold.
Production peaked at 1.2m ounces in 1903, a year when Kalgoorlie had a
population of 30,000 supporting 93 hotels and eight breweries. The high cost
of getting out the gold gradually caught up with the deep mines and activity
in Kalgoorlie slumped until nickel was discovered nearby.
'We felt we were at the centre of the world during the nickel boom. In 1969
brokers from London poured off every plane that arrived,' says Mr Ron
Manners, whose grandfather started a mining equipment supply company in the
town and whose children remain in control. He is executive chairman of a
small gold company, Croesus Mining.
Australia's share of western world nickel supplies went from zero to 15 per
cent in only three years. The number of employees in Mr Manners business
increased from four to 48. Then the nickel price collapsed and he layed off
all but three, closed his offices in town and worked from his home because,
not only had the nickel boom ended as rapidly as it had begun, but
Kalgoorlie's gold operations were at a low ebb. The last operating mine on
the Golden Mile, Mt Charlotte, was about to shut down in 1975 when rescue
came.
The gold price, previously held at fixed levels by western governments, was
freed. 'If Mt Charlotte had closed, miners would have left Kalgoorlie in
droves. It would have become a ghost town. The gold price rise came just in
time,' says Resolute's Mr Kennedy.
New technology also helped to save the day for Kalgoorlie. This technology,
particularly mobile milling plants and carbon-in-pulp recovery of gold
transformed the industry by enabling miners to extract the precious metal
economically from very low grade ore, even below one gram a tonne, compared
with the 40 grams-a-tonne ore the Golden Mile mines were producing in the
early 1900s.
There were also innovative mining finance packages pioneered by Australian
bullion banks. These included such things as gold loans at extremely low
interest rates to be paid back from future production.
A large number of open pit mines using large treatment plants were started
around Kalgoorlie, often on the sites of the old deep-level mines.
In 1984 Mr Alan Bond, the now-tarnished Perth entrepreneur, attempted to
take the economies of scale to the limit by combining the many mines on the
Golden Mile into one. In January 1989 he finally succeeded and agreed terms
to merge his group's interests with those of Homestake, the US-owned
company, into Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines. This brought together six
open pits, five underground mines, five mills and 1,500 people; and its
operations are being transformed into a 'super pit', one of the world's
biggest man-made holes, which can be seen clearly from the moon. It will be
at least 5 km (3 miles) long, 2 km wide and up to 500m deep.
When Mr Bond's financial problems overwhelmed his group, his share of the
super pit operations were sold to Mr Robert Champion de Crespigny's Normandy
Poseidon group. Not everyone believes that this has been a change for the
best.
Mr Tom Bannerman, a lawyer who set up shop in Kalgoorlie in 1970, says the
town then was still one where the local community ran the show. 'Today the
ethos has changed. The town is full of earth-moving contractors waving their
stubbys (beer bottles), the pubs are full of strippers and the town is more
aggressive. I don't like it.'
However, the Super Pit and exciting recent projects such as the Kanowna Bell
mine being developed 20 km outside the town by joint venturers Delta Gold
and Peko Gold, ensure Kalgoorlie has at least 20 years of thriving activity
ahead of it. And yesterday, Mr Richard Court, who was elected Western
Australia's prime minister only four weeks ago, again promised, at the
Australian Gold Conference held as part of the centenary celebrations, that
his government would encourage private industry to build a 2,000 km gas
pipeline from the state's northern oil and gas fields to Kalgoorlie to bring
cheaper energy to the gold fields.
'We believe that the high cost of energy is holding back many projects in
the area,' he said, 'and the pipeline would reduce energy costs by up to 50
per cent. That level of reduction will not only encourage more resource
development but also investment in value-adding industries.'

London COCOA prices closed up to Pounds 22 a tonne weaker after the nearby
May broke through what had proved to be fairly solid support around Pounds
695 a tonne in early trading. 'I think the chartists will be very excited
but there's no fundamental reason behind today's fall,' one trader said.
'It's just that in the light of last week's downward action and this week's
continuation, no one wants to jump in front of the train.' But until either
there is fresh fundamental news or active industry buying, prices look set
to slide further. ALUMINIUM dropped to the lowest levels for around four
months on the London Metal Exchange, reacting to news that January IPAI
producer stocks had risen by 89,000 tonnes, against some expectations of a
decline. Three-month metal failed to hold Dollars 1,170 a tonne, and ended
at Dollars 1,169.50, down Dollars 12. COPPER held in a narrow range, trading
below overnight levels throughout, with resistance building above Dollars
2,160 a tonne for three-month metal.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA'S new coalition government would act quickly to clear-up
the issue of security of land title which was becoming a growing problem for
the mining industry following a series of federal legal court decisions,
including the so-called Mabo high court decision, said Mr Richard Court, the
state's prime minister, yesterday, writes Kenneth Gooding in Kalgoorlie.
During an unscheduled visit to the Australian Gold Conference here Mr Court
said the Mabo case resulted in the high court identifying for the first time
aboriginal native title in Australia.
'The decision has suddenly raised questions of ownership over large
stretches of Crown land, particularly in the Northern Territory, South
Australia and here in Western Australia. In industries that thrive on
certainty, it has created some uncertainties.'
Mr Court said it might be claimed that proper compensation had not been paid
for land on which title had been given since 1975. 'We could end up with
decades of legal disputes which would drive investors away.'
He had set-up a top-level cabinet sub-committee of ministers directly
affected to investigate every aspect of the Mabo case and to liaise with the
federal government and other states.
It might be necessary to legislate to protect landowners but this should be
done at federal level - 'we want one law for all of Australia'.
Mr Court suggested that, as a last resort, if the uncertainty continued too
long, it might be necessary to resort to a referendum to amend the federal
constitution.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Retreating gold price
approaches crunch point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD price continued to retreat on the London bullion market, reaching
fresh seven-year lows of Dollars 326.50 a troy ounce and Dollars 326.10 at
yesterday's morning and afternoon fixings.
The London close of Dollars 326.05 an ounce marked a fall of Dollars 3.90 so
far this week. On the New York Commodity Exchange the active April contract
had recovered from a low of Dollars 325.80 to move back above Dollars 326 a
troy ounce in late trading.
Analysts believe that the US commodity funds will sell heavily if the price
retreats below Dollars 325 a troy ounce, taking the market rapidly down to
Dollars 320 and possibly lower.
There appears, however, to be strong support at Dollars 325 an ounce. If the
market manages to sustain prices above Dollars 326 for the rest of the week,
it could move back up into its recent trading range of Dollars 327 to
Dollars 332 a troy ounce.
If the powerful funds were to push the market lower, producers might start
panic hedging at around Dollars 320 a troy ounce in order to stave off
losses, one analyst suggested yesterday.
Market players are also watching events in Russia. If President Boris
Yeltsin is undermined by his clash with the Russian parliament, so-called
'safe haven' money is expected to go into the US dollar - and the stronger
the dollar, the worse for gold. This week's fall has itself been sparked by
the weakness of the South African rand against the dollar, which has enabled
producers there to sell forward at a profit.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Strong gains in European notes as interest
rates ease
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond prices rallied yesterday, buoyed by the Bundesbank's cut in
the variable-rate repo to 8 1/4 per cent, and the easing of interest rates
in the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark.
German, Dutch and Belgian bonds all ended substantially higher on the day as
dealers returned to speculation about the chances of a two-speed Europe, but
other markets also benefited from the rate easing.
The Bundesbank had announced a cut in its fixed-rate repo to 8 1/4 per cent
on Friday, but dealers were waiting for confirmation yesterday that the new
variable-rate repo would be set in line with the fixed-rate repo.
The move fuelled expectations that a key interest rate reduction will emerge
from the next Bundesbank council meeting, on March 18.
Bund prices rose half a point, after hopes of further easing were sparked by
rate cuts in the Netherlands and Belgium.
THE DUTCH and the Belgian authorities acted in tandem to reduce rates,
following the Bundesbank move, sparking price gains in both bond markets.
Discount rates in both countries were reduced by by  1/4 point to 7 1/4 per
cent.
The Belgian National Bank said the move took into account the recent easing
of German rates and had been facilitated by the strength of the Belgian
franc.
Dutch 10-year bond prices rallied  5/8 point, while 30-year bond prices rose
more than a point, and 10-year Dutch bond yields ended three basis points
below comparable bund yields.
Prices in 10-year Belgian bonds rallied by around  3/8 point following the
rate moves.
THE DANISH bond market rallied strongly yesterday, adding to larger gains
made on Tuesday, when the market soared ahead. The authorities cut interest
rates by half a point yesterday, sparking a rally in the bond market of more
than half a point.
FRENCH government bonds recovered after a weak start to end half a point
higher. However, the tone of the market remains rather nervous in the run up
to the National Assembly elections later this month.
THE GILTS market ended  1/4 point higher yesterday, boosted by news that the
latest Pounds 300m gilt tap had been absorbed by the market. Dealers are now
focusing on next week's Budget, with widespread speculation that this will
include a move to deal with the government's mounting public sector
borrowing requirement.
ITALIAN bond prices recovered somewhat yesterday, after prime minister
Giuliano Amato won a key vote of confidence in the Senate. Prices ended
about  1/4 point higher
THE US bond market traded somewhat erratically yesterday after posting early
gains, although ultimately prices were little changed across the board.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  1/16 at 104
15/16 , yielding 6.736 per cent. At the short end of the market, the
two-year note was down  1/32 at 99 23/32 , to yield 4.013 per cent.
In the middle of the maturity range, however, prices were slightly weaker
amid reports of selling by the German central bank. The seven-year note was
down  7/32 at 104 1/4 , yielding 5.612 per cent.
Prices at the short and long end of the market opened firmer, aided by
continued defeasance buying by municipal funds, and some short covering by
dealers.
After dropping back soon after midday, prices recovered on reports that the
Senate Budget Committee was looking at a plan to slash issuance of 30-year
bonds by the Treasury. The Treasury secretary, however, later said there
would be no dramatic change in the debt mix, and prices eased off their
highs.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Abbey National sets Pounds 650m record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the UK banking group, raised Pounds 650m worth of 10-year
Eurobonds yesterday, setting a new record for a single Eurosterling
transaction in the international bond market.
The previous record holder was the Kingdom of Sweden which raised Pounds
600m in a five-year issue last November. The issue was increased by Pounds
200m in early January.
Abbey National is the latest UK borrower to lock into the country's lowest
interest rates since the 1970s. Last week, British Gas raised Pounds 400m in
the international bond market at an average fixed interest rate of just
under 8 per cent and an average maturity of 8 1/2 years.
Demand for longer-dated sterling paper enabled Abbey National to raise the
size of its issue from an original Pounds 500m. The bonds, which carry a
coupon of 8 per cent, were priced to yield 8.16 per cent or 50 basis points
over the 8 per cent UK gilt due 2003.
There was a view in the market that the bonds were generously priced and
that Abbey National could have sold the bonds with a yield spread in the
mid-40s. However, an official at S. G. Warburg, which arranged the deal with
Goldman Sachs, said that the spread took into consideration the sheer size
of the issue.
When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread tightened to 48 basis points
in mid-afternoon, but this reflected a slightly weaker gilt price.
Mr Jonathan Nicholls, director of corporate finance and capital markets at
Abbey National, said that he did not intend to swap the proceeds from
yesterday's issue since he was happy with the fixed rate on the bonds.
Yesterday's issue, which brings Abbey National's borrowings in the
international bond market since the start of the year to just over Pounds
1bn, considerably lengthened the bank's debt maturity profile. At the end of
1992, only Pounds 386m out of its bonds and notes totalling Pounds 7.15bn
were repayable in more than five years.
The proceeds of the issue will be used for the bank's general funding
purposes. Some analysts said that its 10-year maturity gave the bank leeway
to supply mortgages at a time when retail deposits were falling as a result
of the drop in interest rates.
Mr Nicholls said Abbey's decision to raise such a large sum in one go
reflected an awareness among borrowers that investors increasingly prefer
bonds which are highly liquid. 'It does appear that investors like large
issues,' he said.
Size was also a feature in the D-Mark sector as the European Investment Bank
doubled the amount of its seven-year Eurobonds, launched on Tuesday, to
DM1bn. The terms remained the same.
An official at the lead manager WestLB said that the issuer had been
encouraged by the demand shown from the Far East overnight. The yield spread
on the bonds was unchanged yesterday, at eight basis points over comparable
German government bonds.
The Eurodollar sector attracted more borrowers, as LKB Baden Wurttemberg
Finance raised Dollars 500m through a five-year issue priced to yield 18
basis points over comparable US Treasuries. When the bonds were freed to
trade, the spread was unchanged.
An official at the lead manager CSFB said that LKB's new issue offered
slight pick-up over LKB's five-year Eurodollar bonds launched last December.
The European Coal and Steel Community also tapped the Eurodollar sector for
Dollars 100m. An official at the lead manager Salomon Brothers said that it
would take some time to fully place the issue due to its limited liquidity
and its unusual maturity of 15 years.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, has assigned an investment grade
rating of Baa3 to the Czech National Bank's Dollars 300m three-year Eurobond
issue, which was launched last week.

<TEXT>
THE TREUHAND, Germany's agency responsible for the privatisation of the
eastern economy, is to issue five-year bonds for the first time. The
Treuhand has already been a regular borrower in the 10-year and commercial
paper sectors.
The five-year bonds will be deliverable into the Bobl contracts on
medium-term German paper traded on both the DTB options and futures exchange
and on London's Liffe. They may be used as collateral for Lombard
borrowings, the Bundesbank said.
Officials from Deutsche Bank yesterday described the issue as 'attractive,'
and likely to interest foreign investors. The Treuhand declined to say how
much it intended to raise through this issue. It said there would be several
issues a year.
Both revenue and expenditure fell short of their targets in 1992, according
to the Treuhand annual report, issued earlier this month.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japanese study new
derivatives disclosure rules
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE financial authorities are considering implementing more disclosure
measures for stock index futures and options trading, in which foreign
securities companies are especially active, writes Emiko Terazono.
The ministry of finance said a working group formed by the Tokyo and Osaka
stock exchanges was studying new rules to increase investor information
concerning stock index futures and options markets.
Measures which are being considered include disclosure of futures and
options trading by securities houses' own accounts and client accounts, and
the arbitrage positions held against each stock.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Tokyo poised to deregulate
brokerage commissions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN's ministry of finance is likely to deregulate brokerage commissions in
April 1994, starting with large-lot transactions worth more than Y1bn
(Dollars 8.58m).
An advisory panel to the ministry yesterday recommended that liberalisation
of the country's fixed stock exchange commissions be implemented gradually
while monitoring the effects on investors and securities houses.
Japan is the only leading stockmarket where brokers' commissions are fixed.
A spate of stockmarket scandals two years ago stemmed directly from this
practice. In the absence of price competition firms chose to win large
clients by compensating them for stock losses.
Earlier attempts by the ministry to deregulate the fixed price rate
commission system have met with fierce opposition from the securities
industry, which argues that liberalisation will lead to higher small-lot
rates, driving individuals away from the stock market.

HINDUSTAN Lever, the Indian affiliate of the Anglo-Dutch combine Unilever,
is taking control of Tata Oil Mills Company (Tomco), a member of Tata,
India's largest industrial grouping. It is one of the country's largest
corporate deals.
The companies describe the move as a merger, but management of the combined
group will rest with Hindustan Lever, a local market leader in soaps and
detergents in which Unilever holds a 51 per cent stake.
The deal will permit Lever to bolster its position as it faces growing
competition from multinationals entering the Indian market in the wake of
the economic liberalisation out by Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, the prime
minister. Last December, Godrej, another leading local group, signed a joint
venture with Proctor and Gamble, Unilever's international rival.
.Mr Ratan Tata, chairman of Tata Sons, the group's central company, believes
Tata needs to focus on core businesses such as steel, vehicles, chemicals
and computers.

<TEXT>
MR RUSSI Mody, the 75-year-old chairman of Tata Steel, India's largest
company, is considering resigning in a move which would end a bitter
boardroom battle.
Mr Mody said yesterday that he was considering moving to a rival steel
concern.
He is advising Mukand, a much smaller steelmaker, which is bidding for a
contract to take over Indian Iron and Steel, a lossmaking state-owned
enterprise which the government wants to sell off.
Mr Mody said that, if the bid succeeded and the terms were right, he would
join Mukand.
Indian business circles have been rife with rumours about Mr Mody's possible
departure since the middle of last year, when he lost a struggle to remain
in executive charge of the company, which is the flagship of Tata, India's
leading business empire.
Mr Mody was then forced into the position of non-executive chairman by Mr J
. R . D. Tata, the group's 88-year-old patriarch, and his cousin, Mr Ratan
Tata, Mr J. R. D. Tata's 53-year-old anointed successor.
However, with Mr Mody and Mr J. J. Irani, his successor as managing
director, barely on speaking terms, the atmosphere at Tata Steel has
remained tense.
Executives have divided loyalties. A senior executive said: 'It's difficult
to work until this situation is resolved.'

SAUDI Basic Industries Corporation (Sabic), the Saudi Arabian industrial
conglomerate responsible for the kingdom's petrochemicals industry, has
reported a 14 per cent fall in net profits to SR1.96bn (Dollars 523.7m) for
1992, from SR2.3bn the year before. It ascribes the drop to softer
petrochemicals prices.
Mr Abdulaziz al-Zamil, Sabic chairman and the kingdom's industry minister,
said production from the 18 plants in which Sabic holds a stake had risen by
19 per cent to 15.7m tonnes, with sales up by 23.9 per cent to 12.5m tonnes.
Overall sales revenue rose to SR13bn from SR9bn.
Sabic, which is 70 per cent owned by the government, is undertaking a
Dollars 6bn expansion programme aimed at raising output of MTBE, ethylene,
polyethylene, ammonia, urea and other petrochemical products to 17m tonnes,
rising to 20m tonnes later this decade.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Demand for shareholder equality
at Siemens - The voting strength of preference shares comes under challenge
today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY, a professor of business studies from the university of Wurzburg in
northern Bavaria takes on the full might of Siemens, the Munich-based
electronics and electricals giant.
Prof Ekkehard Wenger, who will be attending the company's annual meeting
today along with scores of his students and several thousand other
shareholders, will be challenging the Siemens colossus on a highly sensitive
issue.
He has proposed a series of motions calling for the abolition of the special
voting rights attached to Siemens' preference shares. These shares are
entirely owned by the von Siemens family, descendants of Werner von Siemens,
who founded the company in 1847.
The challenge will highlight the family's involvement in one of Europe's
largest companies - turnover was nearly DM79bn (Dollars 47.4bn) in the year
to September 1992 - and focus on the management's attitude to shareholder
voting restrictions.
It is part of Prof Wenger's long campaign for shareholders' rights and for
an end to voting restrictions in many leading German companies.
He has turned Germany's usually staid annual meetings into battle-grounds,
using tough rhetoric and legal manoeuvring in a colourful campaign against
Germany's top managers and the kind of capitalism practised by Germany's big
corporations.
Prof Wenger, 40, travels to annual meetings with squads of his students, who
are encouraged to take to the podium and pose difficult questions to
management. He stalks around - as one observer puts it, 'like a lion in a
cage' - taking delight in prolonging the meetings, fostering the image of
the slightly mad professor.
But, for all the appearance of farce, his message is serious. He argues that
German managers are part of a 'self-perpetuating clique' screened off from
stock market pressures by a network of cross-holdings and takeover
prevention devices which encourage complacency and poor business decisions.
In attacking Siemens, Prof Wenger draws parallels with the case of RWE, the
Ruhr-based industrial group where independent shareholders recently tried -
unsuccessfully - to remove a shareholding structure giving local authorities
about 60 of the votes although they only own 30 per cent of the shares.
Calpers, the big US pension fund, said RWE was being unrealistic in
expecting access to international capital markets while maintaining such
structures.
Wenger argues that an anachronistic share structure at Siemens shields
management from stock market pressure. It also disadvantages ordinary
shareholders, of whom there are 583,000, including a high proportion of
foreign or foreign institutional shareholders with about 43 per cent of the
shares.
Some 923,634 Siemens preference shares, issued to the family during the
second world war, are not listed on any stock exchange. They account for
1.65 per cent of share capital, but can exercise 9.15 per cent of the vote.
This, Prof Wenger argues, gives the family a decisive influence on key
company decisions and helps management protect itself against takeover. If
only 50 per cent of shareholders vote at an annual meeting, the family's
preference shares enable it to exercise 20 per cent of the vote - before the
family's unquantified, but probably extensive, holdings of ordinary shares
are accounted for.
Prof Wenger claims the structure is barely-disguised discrimination against
foreign investors, which 'severely limits the influence of
performance-conscious shareholders' over management'. It also ensures that
management is sheltered from the need to manage the business primarily in
the interest of shareholders.
This, he argues, leads to a gap between the share price and the real net
worth of the company. He maintains the true worth of the company is about
DM870 per share, compared with a share price which fluctuated between DM650
and DM700 last year.
Siemens, which has had to go to the trouble and expense of sending a copy of
Wenger's proposals to all its shareholders, says it will not comment in
detail on his criticisms until today's meeting.
In general terms, Siemens says the special voting rights attached to the
preference shares have never been used. It adds that restricted voting
structures are found in countries other than in Germany and that Siemens'
image with international investors has not suffered because of the
preference shares.
Yet, on the same day that Wenger will be attacking the family connection,
the company's management will be seeking shareholder approval for Mr Peter
von Siemens' elevation from the management board to the supervisory board -
hardly a public relations triumph for Siemens. A direct descendant of the
founder, he is grandson of the Mr Ernst von Siemens, who ran the company
from 1939 to 1966.
By exposing the links to the past, Prof Wenger is likely to attract support
for his view that the Siemens voting structure is out of date.
It will also highlight the attitude of the Siemens' management board to
'shareholder value'. In contrast to the board of RWE - which was not averse
to getting rid of the voting restrictions - the Siemens management firmly
defends the status quo.
'It is not good for the image of Germany that a large international company,
such as Siemens, should seek to preserve a shareholder structure which is a
barely-disguised takeover defence mechanism,' says one Frankfurt financier.
Whether Prof Wenger wins the vote depends on how independent shareholders
vote - and the big banks which exercise votes on behalf of shareholders.
Deutsche Bank, the biggest German bank, will side with management and
against Wenger. Perhaps this, too, follows from family loyalty - the bank
was itself founded by a member of the von Siemens family 123 years ago.

Cascades, with plants in Canada, the US, France, Belgium and Sweden, has
restructured Paperboard into a new international packaging group,
selling-off a minority holding to the public.
Hydro-Quebec, the Quebec government-owned power utility, reported 1992
profit of CDollars 724m (USDollars 583m), down 4.7 per cent from 1991, on
revenues of CDollars 6.8bn, up 9 per cent, due mainly to higher rates.
Domestic sales rose 3.8 per cent and exports 26 per cent.

W&amp;A INVESTMENT Corporation, the diversified South African industrial

in a rights issue to recapitalise the group.
Last month, it was announced that Trencor, the highly-rated South African
transport and container company, would support a rights issue, investing
R350m in a recapitalised W&amp;A, and thereby obtaining joint control. Trencor
will have an effective 26.5 per cent stake in W&amp;A.
W&amp;A also said it suffered attributable losses of R11.5m in 1992 from profits
of R129m the year before. Turnover slipped to R3.19bn from R3.23bn but
adverse trading conditions saw operating profits fall by 35 per cent to
R217.6m from R335.5m.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM Fund, the Dublin-listed investment fund, will seek to raise a
further Dollars 20m this year to add to the Dollars 10m it has raised and
committed to projects in Vietnam.
Vietnam is regarded as one of Asia's most exciting investment opportunities,
but international fund managers have found it hard both to raise money and
to find worthwhile projects; two other funds for Vietnam have already
folded.
Mr Donald Lemon, Vietnam Fund consultant, said the fund had so far invested
in a company growing vegetables for export and was planning to put money
into at least four property development projects.
The fund is also considering investing in packaging and rubber-wood
processing plants. A further 150 proposals in a range of sectors had been
rejected, he said.
Vietnam Fund will probably attempt to raise the extra Dollars 20m in two
parts, first from institutional investors in Europe and Australia and later
in the year from the US; Americans are banned by Washington from doing
business in Vietnam under an embargo dating back to the Vietnam War, but the
Clinton administration is expected to lift this.
Mr Lemon said the fund might issue partly-paid units so it would not have to
manage substantial amounts of cash.

THE OSLO bourse, struggling to recoup trading volume lost to foreign stock
markets, is to extend its trading session by one hour to 4pm.
The extension, which takes effect from May 3, will initially apply to shares
and share derivatives.
The aim is to strengthen Oslo's competitive position in relation to trade in
Norwegian shares, the bourse said.
In recent years, London has become the alternative market for Norwegian
shares. London member-firms reported composite trading in Norwegian shares
worth Pounds 4.94bn (Dollars 7.08m) for 1992, compared with NKr63bn (Dollars
8.88m) in Oslo.
On London's Seaq exchange, turnover reached Pounds 4.1bn last year on 22
Norwegian shares, against NKr30.1bn in Oslo.

TOYS 'R' Us, the US-based specialty store chain, yesterday reported a 29 per
cent increase in after-tax profits to Dollars 437.5m in the 12 months to
end-January.
The group said that it planned to add another 95 to 100 stores this year,
the majority overseas.
Toys 'R' Us scored the advance on sales of Dollars 7.17bn, up from Dollars
6.12bn, while earnings per share rose from Dollars 1.15 to Dollars 1.47.
The company added 43 stores in the US in 1992, and 41 outlets overseas -
taking the total to 540 US-based toy stores, 167 international outlets and
215 Kids 'R' Us children's clothing stores.
The full-year figures came after a strong fourth quarter, when after-tax
profits increased from Dollars 261.6m to Dollars 339.7m. Sales in the
three-month period were up from Dollars 2.86bn to Dollars 3.4bn.
Revco, the Ohio-based drugstore operator which emerged from bankruptcy
protection last year, recorded an after-tax profit of Dollars 4.27m in the
three months to February 6.
Sales were Dollars 552.4m, compared with Dollars 522.9m a year ago, and
operating profit increased from Dollars 18m to Dollars 24.6m.
The company said that same-store sales in the quarter - the third of its
financial year - rose by 4.6 per cent.
For the nine-month period, Revco's after-tax profits stand at Dollars 2.2m
and sales at Dollars 1.51bn.

<TEXT>
NOVO NORDISK, the pharmaceuticals and industrial enzymes group, reported a
jump of 38 per cent in net profits to DKr1.27bn (Dollars 198m) last year
from DKr928m in 1991.
The boost to net earnings was helped by a reduction in the Danish corporate
profits tax rate from 38 to 34 per cent, a factor in reducing Novo Nordisk's
tax to DKr401m from DKr531m in 1991, according to the preliminary report.
Earnings per share were up by 26 per cent from DKr27.02 to DKr34.12.
An unchanged DKr4 per share (20 per cent) dividend was proposed. Pre-tax
profits increased by a more moderate 15 per cent to DKr1.67bn from
DKr1.48bn. Sales were ahead by 14 per cent to DKr10.69bn from DKr9.36bn in
1991.
The group continued to expand production capacity in both Denmark and
abroad, mainly in the US, for its major products, insulin, growth hormone
and enzymes, with investment expenditure rising by 45 per cent last year to
DKr1.95bn.
Trading conditions and instability in the foreign exchange and capital
markets may make it difficult to achieve the group's goal of an annual 15
per cent growth in pre-tax income, the report said.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Procordia lifts payout as
earnings rise to SKr4.8bn

PROCORDIA, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group, lifted profits after
financial items by 31 per cent to SKr4.86bn (Dollars 637m) in 1992,
following strong contributions from its Kabi Pharmacia and United Brands
units.
The group is increasing its dividend to SKr3.55 per share from SKr3.15 after
a performance which saw turnover rise 5 per cent to SKr40.09bn and earnings
per share increase to SKr13.50 from SKr12.90.
Procordia said discussions to buy a significant stake in the Italian
pharmaceuticals group Erbamont from Montedison were continuing, and it
expected the deal to be finalised soon.
However, it did not significantly elaborate on its statement last month,
when it first disclosed that talks were in progress.
It is thought that the group will take majority control of Erbamont in a
deal which would create one of Europe's largest drug companies.
Privatisation of Procordia, originally planned for last year, has been
delayed pending finalisation of the deal.
Procordia's 1992 performance was distorted by extensive restructuring and
sale and purchase activity. Income from continuing operations was SKr4.36bn,
up 6 per cent on 1991.
Kabi Pharmacia, the unit which would merge with Erbamont, increased 1992
profits to SKr2.65bn from SKr2.35bn.
Turnover climbed 16 per cent to SKr13.36bn, reflecting the group's
acquisition of Pierrel of Italy and Farmiberia, although Kabi's existing
units boosted sales by 12 per cent.
United Brands, Procordia's tobacco, matches and confectionery unit, was the
other strong performer, with an 18 per cent increase in sales to SKr6.78bn
and a 9 per cent rise in profits to SKr1.21bn.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lafarge Copee holds profits at
FFr1.23bn

<TEXT>
LAFARGE COPEE, the French company which is the world's largest building
materials group, yesterday announced that it had maintained net profits at
FFr1.23bn (Dollars 217.5m) last year, but warned that it faced tough trading
conditions in the current year.
Mr Bertrand Collomb, chairman, said Lafarge had held profits in spite of the
fragile state of the construction market in parts of Europe and North
America.
The group's 1992 performance was rather better than the stock market had
expected. Analysts had forecast a slight decline in net profits in what
would have been a repetition of its 1991 results, when net profits fell for
the first time in eight years.
Mr Collomb described the outlook for 1993 as uncertain, but hoped that
fledgling recovery in the US would counter the slowdown in Europe. He
expected problems in France during the first half, but hoped the economy
would recover in the second half.
Lafarge, like other construction companies, was badly affected last year by
the sluggish state of its markets in France and Spain. However, it benefited
from an improvement in its US activities, the chief cause of the decline in
profits during 1991.
Turnover fell to FFr30.45bn in 1992 from FFr31.65bn in 1991, and operating
profits slipped to FFr3.14bn from FFr3.22bn over the same period. Net debt
rose to FFr9.7bn last year from FFr9.1bn in 1991.
Mr Collomb has already announced that Lafarge, which has expanded rapidly
through acquisition in recent years, will concentrate on consolidating its
existing interests and on reducing debt.
The group is also attempting to cut costs and improve productivity. It
reduced its workforce by 1,500, or 5 per cent, last year to the present
level of 30,000.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: SBC helped by extraordinary gain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SWISS Bank Corporation (SBC), Switzerland's second-largest banking group,
avoided a sharp decline in profits last year thanks to an extraordinary
SFr255m (Dollars 165.3m) net gain on asset sales.
The extraordinary gain came almost entirely from the sale last May of the
bank's 97.7 per cent stake in the Austrian electric utility, Steiermarkische
Elektrizitat, to another Austrian utility, Oesterreichische
Elektrizitatswirtschaft.
The group yesterday revealed that net consolidated profit fell to SFr1.006bn
from SFr1.032bn a year earlier. Net income from operations slid 30 per cent
to SFr758m, by far the worst performance among the big three Swiss banks.
However, the SFr14-a-share dividend is being maintained, and Mr Walter
Frehner, chief executive, said he was 'cautiously optimistic' about an
earnings improvement.
Like other leading international banks, SBC suffered last year from a hefty
boost in bad-loan provisions, which jumped by nearly one-third to SFr1.9bn.
The unusual negative development at SBC was a 13.1 per cent surge in
operating costs to SFr4.1bn, which significantly outpaced the 9.3 per cent
growth of net operating income to SFr7bn.
SBC officials attributed about SFr120m of the SFr471m increase in expenses
to conservative treatment of the costs of reorganising the group's Swiss
private banking businesses and of integrating the O'Conner derivatives
subsidiary.
Mr Frehner, who is to become chairman next month, pointed out that in spite
of these setbacks the group's earning power remained intact. Cash-flow
advanced 4.5 per cent to SFr2.9bn last year.
Moreover, SBC's financial strength, which was implicitly questioned last May
when Moody's downgraded its credit rating, has improved. The risk-weighted
capital ratio, according to the so-called BIS formula, rose from 10.9 per
cent at the end of 1991 to 11.5 per cent at the end of last year - the
highest among the big three Swiss banks.
The capital strengthening reflected a 2.9 per cent decline in assets to
SFr201bn at the end of 1992, which was in turn caused by a 4.6 per cent
slide in lending to customers, to SFr113bn, and a 14 per cent cut in
interbank lending to SFr42bn.

BAYERISCHE Hypotheken-und Wechsel Bank, the Bavarian bank, is making a
one-for-10 rights issue to raise DM678m (Dollars 406.6m). The new shares are
being issued at DM350, compared with a closing price yesterday of DM451.
The Hypo-Bank said the decision to go ahead with the issue had been taken
following a year of strong growth in both profits and business volume.
The bank will publish its full figures for 1992 in two weeks. In December it
reported that partial operating profits - which exclude income from
own-account trading - had climbed by 23.2 per cent to DM1.27bn in the first
10 months of the year.

FT  11 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lower dollar and weak markets
take their toll on Hunter Douglas

<TEXT>
HUNTER Douglas, the Dutch window-covering and architectural products
manufacturer, suffered a 53.2 per cent decline in net profits in 1992,
reflecting continued weakness in important markets, the lower US dollar and
a decline in aluminium prices.
Net profit fell to Fl 33.4m (Dollars 18m) from Fl 71.4m a year earlier, on
sales down 4.7 per cent at Fl 1.68bn. The company cut its dividend to Fl
1.50 from Fl 2.00, saying this reflected not only the fall in 1992 profit
but also 'the conservative outlook for 1993.'
However, Hunter Douglas described its pay-out ratio as high when viewed
historically, and said this was due to its sound balance sheet and
confidence about the longer term. It made no specific forecast for 1993, but
said it expected a difficult and challenging year.
The 1992 figures include an extraordinary charge of Fl 13.5m for
restructuring in the Netherlands and south-east Asia. If the charge is
excluded, net profit would have fallen by 34.3 per cent to Fl 46.9bn.
Hunter Douglas said that business in Europe weakened, especially in the
second half, while economic recovery in the US and Australia was slower than
expected, restricting consumer spending. Lower aluminium prices had a
negative impact on aluminium smelting operations.
Koninklijke Van Ommeren, the transport and tank storage group, said it could
invest up to Fl 500m in expansion, but that better returns on existing
investments were its top priority, Reuter reports from Rotterdam.
'We are examining all activities critically on the basis of returns,' said
Mr Carel van den Driest, chairman. He added that the sale of Ceteco, the
trade arm, had given it scope for 'ambitious' expansion in shipping and
storage.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: The need to take a firmer grip on financial
controls / A look at the difficult task facing the incoming chief executive
of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CHARLES Scott faces a difficult task when he takes over as chief
executive of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi next month.
He has to tighten further the financial disciplines imposed on the world's
second largest advertising group by his predecessor, Mr Robert
Louis-Dreyfus, when he salvaged the company.
On Monday Saatchi wrote off Pounds 600m of goodwill associated with
highly-expensive acquisitions made by the group in the 1980s. That
attention-grabbing figure represented another purge of the financial
excesses built up by Saatchi during its headlong expansion. But there is
still more for Mr Scott to squeeze out of the group if it is to fulfill the
recovery potential it now has.
Much of the written-off goodwill is from the Ted Bates agency which Saatchi
bought for Pounds 450m in 1986. As with WPP, such acquisitions were financed
through debt in the belief that the 1980s boom in advertising spend would
continue forever. That boom did not last, however.
Mr Louis-Dreyfus, who is moving on to try to turn around the Adidas sports
show company, was pulled in to rescue Saatchi from looming financial
disaster in January 1990. He inherited 18,000 staff and the threat of having
to redeem Pounds 211m of Euro-preference shares in 1993. He will leave
behind him a successful recapitalisation in March 1991, which gained Pounds
60m in new equity, and staff levels brought down to 12,000.
But problems remain and some analysts feel that Mr Louis-Dreyfus is
departing with the task only half completed. There are some problems
remaining from the excesses of the 1980s - not least the estimated Pounds
20m annual cost of the holding company, which has scarcely been trimmed at
all since Mr Louis-Dreyfus first arrived.
The first main problem concerns debt. Average net debt at the end of 1992
was Pounds 194m, down from Pounds 225m a year ago but which will rise
slightly this year - the last year of heavy earn-out payments, amounting to
some Pounds 18m. 1994 will see the last earn-outs, at Pounds 1m. Losses on
surplus office space will amount to Pounds 15m this year, falling to an
expected Pounds 14m in 1994, Pounds 12m in 1995 and Pounds 9m in 1996.
Mr Scott has said that debt reduction will be a priority; the first
repayment of Pounds 20m falls due in December this year. But Saatchi's
ability to repay debt is largely dependent on substantial revenue growth;
given indications that the US is pulling out of its recession and that
almost half of the group's revenues derive from the US, there are
well-founded hopes that the group will benefit late this year from a general
upturn in global advertising expenditure.
However, while analysts forecast pre-tax profits growing from 1992's
underlying figure of Pounds 18.9m to Pounds 23m this year and Pounds 45m in
1994, the recovery needs to be strong in order for Saatchi to be able to
reassure its bankers that it will not breach its covenants, which Mr Scott
says has not happened so far.
The second concerns salaries, which account for some 60 per cent of fixed
costs - an annual bill slightly less than Pounds 300m. A year ago Saatchi
had 300 executives earning a minimum basic salary of Pounds 150,000; today
there are 250. They will gradually be introduced to a system of variable
remunerations, dependent on performance.
That will be a painful experience and already some senior Saatchi employees
are murmuring rebellion against Mr Scott. As Mr Louis-Dreyfus will continue
as a non-executive director, Mr Scott will have some supporting muscle.
But perhaps Mr Scott's most difficult task is more intangible. He needs to
inculcate his senior staff with his own emphasis on the importance of sound
financial controls, even if that means losing clients who are not prepared
to pay at levels profitable for the group.
In another effort to tighten financial controls, Mr Scott has said that
Saatchi will no longer take on loss leaders. He was asked at the group's
results presentation on Monday whether that meant Saatchi would in future
decline handling the Conservative party's advertising account which is
thought to be something of a loss-leader. He replied: 'We will not take on
new clients if we do not see that we will make money from them.'
If Mr Scott intends taking a firmer line with his own group, he also seems
willing to take on those of its clients deemed unprofitable. He has
signalled that if Saatchi thinks it is 'over-servicing' clients, or if
clients are unwilling to pay sufficient to ensure group profitability, then
the group will either seek to renegotiate fees or, failing success with
that, break the relationship.
If he is true to his declarations so far, shareholders may raise their
hopes, though as one analyst put it, 'this is not a stock for grannies and
widows.' Certainly analysts are feeling more confident about Saatchi's
future than for several years. They expect small dividend payments to
restart in 1995 or 1996, by which time the group is expected to be making
annual pre-tax profits of about Pounds 65m.

The increase to Pounds 981,000 (Pounds 911,000) was achieved on turnover up
from Pounds 16.4m to Pounds 17.6m.
However, directors said margins in the spinning division were still under
pressure and 'likely to remain so'. The fabric side reported improved sales
and profits.
Earnings per share edged ahead to 3p (2.8p); the interim dividend is held at
1p.

Everest Foods, the food group, returned profits of Pounds 1.18m pre-tax for
the half year ended November 30, a 34 per cent fall on last time's Pounds
1.78m.
The directors said the disruption caused by the continuation of the capital
expenditure programme to secure substantial growth for the future had
'impacted on the results.'
Turnover slipped to Pounds 16.2m (Pounds 17.9m). Nevertheless, the interim

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Amstrad claims lead in new product sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, the consumer electronics company, is hoping to lead the world with
a new kind of computer - a personal digital assistant - to be launched in
London next Thursday, writes Alan Cane.
Shares closed the day 3 3/4 p up at 31 1/4 p.
However, the launch is likely to spark complaints that Mr Alan Sugar,
Amstrad chairman, misled shareholders during his unsuccessful battle last
year to take the company private in claiming that no 'blockbuster' products
were in store which could revive the company's waning fortunes.
Amstrad is claiming that the new product will be the world's first in a
product sector which some analysts claim could be worth as much as Dollars
20bn (Pounds 14bn) a year in sales by 2000.
Personal digital assistants, hand-held devices which will accept handwritten
messages and which may include telephone and fax capabilities, are being
touted as the answer to stagnant growth in the consumer electronics market.
IBM, Apple, AT&amp;T, Matsushita and Olivetti are among the world's leading
companies with plans to launch the product.
Amstrad said yesterday that the devices could not be considered a
blockbuster in the same way that its personal computers and word processors
had been when they won huge sales by selling for less than Pounds 400 when
equivalent products from traditional manufacturers were priced at Pounds
2,000.
Publicity material from Amstrad says, however, that next week's launch will
be 'the first time a revolutionary product incorporating state of the art
technology will be sold at a mass market price from launch'.
Mr Sugar failed in December to persuade shareholders to sell him back the
company at 30p a share. Amstrad surprised the City by turning in a profit of
Pounds 5.61m in the first half of the year, but Mr Sugar warned there was no
guarantee the company would be profitable in the full year. Close colleagues
yesterday defended Mr Sugar, pointing out it would be impossible for him to
market a new product aggressively without it being labelled a potential
blockbuster.

CLUFF RESOURCES, the minerals, oil and gas exploration company, swung from
profits of Pounds 2.25m to losses of Pounds 225,000 pre-tax for the year to
end-December after taking account of an exceptional charge of Pounds 1.64m.
Losses per share emerged at 2.38p (earnings 1.37p) and the dividend is
passed in order to conserve cash - 1p was paid previously.
The exceptional charge comprised a complete write-down of the gold mining
assets in Spain.
Other factors affecting the result included a lower sterling gold price and
a substantial rise in interest rates in Zimbabwe.
The shares dipped 1p to 11 1/2 p.
The company has changed its accounting policy with regard to oil and gas
exploration expenditure. The 1991 comparative figures have been restated
accordingly.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sorry example in the far-flung banking
empire - Bombay scandal raises questions about control
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LITTLE piece of British understatement appeared yesterday in Standard
Chartered's review of what has forced it to set aside Pounds 272m against
its involvement in the Bombay securities market scandal. It referred to 'the
challenging environment' in which it was trying to retrieve its exposure of
Pounds 343m.
This environment is the atmosphere of hostility among Indian politicians to
overseas banks such as Standard Chartered. The bank's earlier belief that
its cause would be aided by Indian politicians and bank regulators was
severely dented in the second half of 1992.
Incidents such as the resignation in November of Mr G Ramaswamy, the
attorney general, calls by politicians for the operations of foreign banks
to be curtailed, and this week's highly critical report from the Reserve
Bank of India, the country's central bank, have all taken their toll.
Although the bank's exposure is only calculated to have risen by Pounds 51m
because of exchange rate movement, it boosted general provisions by Pounds
160m in the second half. Thus the bank has in effect admitted that its
earlier bet that it would receive sympathy and help from authorities is now
off.
It should arguably have come as little surprise, given the scale of the
uproar when the scandal broke nearly a year ago. Alongside the other
longest-established foreign bank in the country - the ANZ-owned Grindlays -
Standard was a natural target for street demonstrators.
Political pressure in India has not abated. The Reserve Bank of India has
itself been under attack for inadequate regulation of the securities market.
Its own investigations have thrown the responsibility onto foreign banks,
and away from the Indian state-owned banks caught in the affair.
Standard was not one of the most aggressive foreign banks in the market for
bankers' receipts, though its losses are the biggest. The market, driven
mainly by Citibank, grew at a feverish pace alongside Bombay's booming stock
market during 1991. But Standard's large network and early identification
with the scandal have made it a ready target.
The bank emphasised yesterday that it had not written the money off, but had
just recognised that recovery was uncertain and could take time. 'The fact
that we are providing does not mean that we have given up. We are quite
tenacious in pursuing money due to us,' said Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief
executive.
But Bombay raises a wider question about controls at Standard, which Mr
Williamson describes as 'pear-shaped' because of the weight of its assets in
the Asia Pacific. The incident has proved such a shock that it has been
reviewing its central control over other operations since then.
The bank has used auditors to check controls in markets in which there has
been recent deregulation. Among the operations it has scanned for possible
weakness have been Shenzen, the free market trading zone in southern China,
and its Treasury operations in countries such as Indonesia.
In practice, the only part of its operation it identified as operating laxly
was its credit card business in Malaysia where staff had been not been
setting accounts limits for well-regarded locals. It has changed this
practice, although it calculates its total exposure at only Pounds 5m.
'We have made sure there are no latent Indias,' said Mr Williamson. Yet some
doubts remain, given the bank's history. Until the arrival of Mr Rodney
Galpin, the chairman who retires in May, operations in different countries
had been largely free of central or regional controls.
Apart from the review of operational controls, it has also established
central limits on lending in particular sectors within which businesses have
to operate. Yet it still relies on local management knowledge to assess
risks that can vary widely according to the country and region.
The biggest risk question hangs over operations in the Asia Pacific and Hong
Kong, which produced Pounds 315m in operating profits last year, plus a
further Pounds 67m through release of bad debt provisions. The total assets
in the region grew to Pounds 14bn from Pounds 11.3bn through exchange
movements and expansion.
Mr Williamson emphasised that the bank has be re-balancing its portfolio
there to reduce risk from long-term lending. The longest-term form of
lending is its mortgage book in Hong Kong, which it believes is well-covered
because it has lent only up to 60 per cent of current property values.
Barring further surprises like Bombay, Standard's profits look set for
steady increases as Asia Pacific operations grow and a restoration of UK
profits reduces tax charges. But India remains a sorry example of how badly
things can go wrong in the far-flung banking empire that Standard remains.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: T&amp;N shows 56% advance to Pounds 63m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH UK performance bouncing back thanks to increased efficiency, T&amp;N
increased pre-tax profits by 56 per cent from Pounds 40.4m to Pounds 63m in
the year to end-December.
Trading profit gains of nearly two thirds in the UK and 30 per cent in the
US lay behind the improvement. Turnover in the motor components and
engineering group rose slightly to Pounds 1.39bn (Pounds 1.36bn).
T&amp;N held an uncovered dividend for the second year running. A final of 7.25p
kept the total at 10.85p compared with earnings per share of 6p (2.75p). The
retained loss after the Pounds 47.5m dividend bill was Pounds 21.3m (Pounds
36.3m).
Mr Colin Hope, chairman and chief executive, confirmed the likelihood of
nearly Pounds 40m being raised in a share placing this spring. This would
pay the first DM90m (Pounds 38m) instalment on the DM250m acquisition of
Goetze, a German components maker.
As Goetze, which is trading at about break-even on Pounds 300m-plus sales,
will bring in nearly Pounds 50m debt, T&amp;N's gearing is set to rise from 45
per cent to about 60 per cent this year.
Mr Hope said that with the German market 'facing a dramatic downturn for two
years or so', the outlook was darker than when the decision was taken to buy
Goetze. However, 'our ability to put the company right increases as the
market gets worse,' he said, referring to the humbling effect on the German
workforce.
T&amp;N is already losing money in Germany, although Pounds 2m of the Pounds
2.8m deficit last year was related to redundancies and other rationalisation
costs.
Losses of Pounds 1.5m were also made in Italy. Suppliers were caught between
government-induced wage rises and a squeeze on prices by Fiat. Overall
continental trading profit slipped to Pounds 8.9m (Pounds 9.2m), made mainly
in France.
The UK provided a contrast, with trading profit up from Pounds 27m to Pounds
43.9m on flat turnover of Pounds 531m (Pounds 534m), of which nearly half
was exported.
In North America, where T&amp;N acquired JPI in 1990, trading profit advanced
from Pounds 15.7m to Pounds 20.4m on sales of Pounds 333m (Pounds 318m).
That region's profitability still fell short of the Pounds 21.5m (Pounds
20.7m) achieved in Zimbabwe. South Africa also improved, from Pounds 7.4m to
Pounds 9.6m.
COMMENT
The step towards better margins was a welcome one as T&amp;N continues to spend
on many fronts: acquisitions, plant, R&amp;D and dividends, with the last still
attracting the most criticism. It would do remarkably well to reach its
target of 10 per cent return on sales by 1994 with Goetze bringing little
short-term profit. Counting in the whole purchase price sends gearing to
more than 70 per cent. Even if T&amp;N succeeds in selling off Goetze's flats
and forests, a rights issue looks on the cards for 1994. After all, Mr Hope
can still see gaps in the global empire, and last year's deterioration in
net debt of Pounds 36m (or Pounds 70m after the adverse currency swing) was
a bit disappointing. This year's pluses should include further US and UK
recovery and rationalisation benefits to offset the continental downturn. A
pre-tax profit forecast of about Pounds 75m, earnings of 9p, gives a
prospective p/e of 21 reflecting recovery hopes. The attractive yield of 7.7
per cent may be tempered later in the year if doubts grow about its
maintenance.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cost cutting helps GKN rise to Pounds 122m
 -Automotive and engineered products assumed growing importance for the
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRINGENT cost-cutting helped GKN, the motor components and industrial
services group, increase pre-tax profits by 77 per cent, from Pounds 68.7m
to Pounds 121.8m, in the year to end-December.
The improvement was made on turnover only 3.8 per cent higher, at Pounds
2.53bn from Pounds 2.43bn.
The profits rise is pared to 23 per cent on a pre-FRS 3 basis, reflecting
much larger below-the-line losses incurred in 1991 on the sale or closure of
businesses.
Nevertheless, Sir David Lees, chairman and chief executive, was able to
present a picture of improving prospects for the group in the UK and North
America, coupled with a caution about deteriorating markets in continental
Europe.
The net effect, said Sir David, is that any financial progress GKN makes
this year will once again depend mainly on the group's ability to make
further progress on cost-cutting and productivity.
The group is setting aside Pounds 10m for further restructuring compared
with a higher-than-expected Pounds 13m last year.
A maintained final dividend of 12.5p makes an unchanged total of 20.5p
compared with earnings per share of 18.6p (4.1p).
With GKN's industrial services and distribution businesses being hit by a
variety of recession-related problems, automotive and engineered products
last year assumed growing importance for the group. They accounted for
Pounds 1.52bn, or 76 per cent, of turnover, up from Pounds 1.41bn
previously, with trading profit rising from Pounds 60m to Pounds 95m.
In contrast turnover on industrial services and distribution fell to Pounds
471m from Pounds 512m, and trading profit to Pounds 31m from Pounds 35m.
The group's share of sales by associated companies, at Pounds 532,8m, was
Pounds 25.9m above 1991, but the share of profits down marginally at Pounds
24.2m (Pounds 28.5m), largely as a result of a Pounds 3m loss at UES
Holdings.
Further progress on reducing debt has cut gearing to 23.3 per cent from 26.4
per cent, said Sir David. However GKN's tax bill rose sharply, from Pounds
41.3m to Pounds 56.8m, prompting Sir David to call for legislative changes
to reduce the burden of unrelieved Advance Corporation Tax. He protested
that ACT now accounted for 12 percentage points of the tax charge.
COMMENT
GKN has won considerable credit for the way it has managed recession so far.
However, the restatement of last year's figures under FRS 3 show just how
much pain it took in 1991 when pre-tax profit fell to a third of 1989's
Pounds 206m peak. It is worth emphasising the 'so far' because European car
sales are expected to fall by 1m this year from last year's 13.4m total.
Fears are commonly expressed about the potential for severe competition,
particularly from German suppliers. While US recovery should provide a
cushion, the speed with which manufacturers have increased output ahead of
actual sales suggests there could be some hiccups. Whatever the quibbling
over market prospects and over the quality of some of GKN's non-auto
earnings, you have to admire the cash management. Net debt has virtually
halved since December 1989. This has been achieved without a rights issue,
whereas T&amp;N has had two. This year a pre-tax profits forecast of Pounds 150m
gives a prospective p/e of 19 on yesterday's 485p close. After rising by
nearly 50 per cent in six months, the price derives some support from the
5.6 per cent yield.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Mortgage claims hold back recovery at Eagle
Star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURANCE claims stemming from the slump in the property market have slowed
the pace of recovery at Eagle Star.
The composite insurer, which is a subsidiary of BAT Industries, yesterday
reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 71.4m for 1992, compared with a Pounds
394m deficit previously.
It declared losses of Pounds 146m on commercial mortgage indemnity policies,
a line of business which it no longer underwrites. On all classes of
mortgage indemnity business the company has paid more than Pounds 900m in
claims since 1990.
The Pounds 146m figure included a Pounds 77m loss on 'agency pool' business,
which relates to the insurance of loans made by centralised mortgage
lenders, following the adoption of a more cautious accounting policy for
this class of business.
Losses from domestic mortgage indemnity business, which Eagle Star continues
to underwrite (although on a different basis), declined from Pounds 213m to
Pounds 97m.
Mr Clive Coates, finance director, warned that new claims could emerge in
1993 as a result of an increase in mortgage arrears.
Existing provisions amount to Pounds 307m on commercial mortgage business,
Pounds 150m on agency pool business and Pounds 220m on domestic mortgage
indemnity business, making a total of nearly Pounds 680m.
Gross claims on all mortgage indemnity business paid in 1992 amounted to
Pounds 260m (Pounds 230m after reinsurance recoveries).
These losses offset an improved performance on most other lines of business.
UK underwriting losses from personal insurance (home and motor) fell to
Pounds 75.2m and on commercial insurance to Pounds 64.5m, as a result of
more selective underwriting and premium rate increases of between 5 and 20
per cent.
Non-life premium income increased to Pounds 1.9bn (Pounds 1.7bn), but life
business premiums fell to Pounds 866m (Pounds 940m), partially because Eagle
Star Life has reduced its involvement in the single premium bond market
Overall underwriting losses on 'continued business' were Pounds 280.3m
(Pounds 563.7m). Investment income rose to Pounds 237m (Pounds 219m). Life
profits were Pounds 50.2m (Pounds 55.3m). Operating profits of Pounds 14.5m
on continued business compared with losses of Pounds 145m (Pounds 123m loss)
on discontinued business and gains on disposal of discontinued operations of
Pounds 58.8m (Pounds 31.1m).
BAT Industries' other financial services operations both performed well.
Farmers, the California-based company, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds
408m, up 14 per cent.
Allied Dunbar, the Swindon-based life insurance subsidiary, announced a
post-tax surplus of Pounds 114m, 8 per cent up on 1991 and a pre-tax surplus
of Pounds 123m, marginally ahead of last year.
New business was 9 per cent down, however, reflecting the continued impact
of recession among the self-employed and small company sectors.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BAT sees 'sin tax' of Dollars 2 as
unrealistic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, said he expected that
President Clinton would impose a federal 'sin tax' on tobacco, but thought
it was unlikely to start before 1994.
While he did not rule out an increase in tax from 24 cents a packet to 50
cents or even higher, Sir Patrick said he thought rumours of a levy of
Dollars 2 per packet being spread by anti-smoking campaigners were 'totally
unrealistic'.
He said: 'People can just roll their own, and America is a tobacco-growing
country. There is also a huge land border - Canada has seen a big increase
in smuggling since prices were increased there.'
Sir Patrick gave three reasons for confidence, even if US taxes were
increased - BAT's high level of cigarette exports from the US, the
continuing growth in world demand for tobacco, and the group's expectations
that its financial services businesses would show further growth and
recovery.
BAT said that it was particularly encouraging that cigarette exports,
especially from the UK, US, Germany and Brazil, had grown by a further 23
per cent. Exports now accounted for almost a quarter of group sales.
Export volumes from the UK had increased substantially, mainly to the Far
East. With export growth set to expand further, a Pounds 175m development
programme was well under way at BAT's Southampton factory, which exports all
its output. The group's annual production capacity in the UK will eventually
rise to 55bn cigarettes.
BAT has also authorised a large investment programme at its plant at Macon
in the US, which will increase its annual capacity by 50 per cent, to 150bn
cigarettes.
Sir Patrick said: 'This export success is all the more important in the
light of the extremely competitive pressures which were affecting margins in
the US domestic market. However, we are improving market share there,
particularly in the rapidly growing value-for-money segment.'
Domestic market share also grew in Germany and Australia, where there had
been a good recovery.
The group's market share had remained stable in Brazil, at 83 per cent, even
though the overall market volume increased in the face of difficult market
conditions.
However, it said that more realistic pricing had led to a notable increase
in trading profit.
In Asia, BAT Hong Kong's domestic volumes and market shares were down, while
profits were lower due to excise increases and higher costs. Elsewhere,
volumes and profits were higher overall.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester falls 29% to Pounds
130.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester Building Society yesterday reported a 29 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 183.8m to Pounds 130.6m, for the 12
months to December 31 after making large provisions against loans inherited
from the troubled Portsmouth Building Society in 1991.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester's performance was heavily weighed down by its
exposure to the southern housing market, although it continued to expand its
share of the UK mortgage market with a growth in assets to Pounds 16.1bn
(Pounds 14.8bn).
Although operating profits rose by 34 per cent to Pounds 341.3m (Pounds
255.5m), the society nearly tripled its provisions for bad debts to Pounds
210.7m (Pounds 71.7m). This included Pounds 90m on loans made by the
Portsmouth, and some commercial loans.
The Portsmouth merger was one of the cases during 1991 in which larger
societies took on small southern-based societies with poor mortgage books.
The society said yesterday that it did not envisage that further
provisioning would be required in the current year to cover inherited
problems. It said its mortgage book remained strong by comparison with other
societies.
The post-tax return on mean assets fell to 0.56 per cent (0.95 per cent),
while management expenses per Pounds 100 of mean total assets fell to 63p
(68p).
The society raised its net share of the mortgage market despite an overall
fall in lending to Pounds 2.3bn (Pounds 3.6bn).
It also had a net retail inflow of Pounds 474m (Pounds 709m) despite an
overall net outflow for the industry of Pounds 295m during 1992.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive, said the need for 'prudent
provisioning in 1992 to cover one-off items should not detract from the
fundamentally sound operating profits and quality mortgage book'.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Irish political football becomes a hot
potato - The chief executive of Aer Lingus may not be the only head to roll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR CATHAL Mullan, who until Tuesday night was the chief executive of Aer
Lingus, the Irish state airline, must be pondering the irony of his fate. He
was due to chair a conference next month entitled 'The Management Paradox -
Survival, Growth and Jobs' organised by the Irish Management Institute.
His own job has now gone, 600 others in the company will go shortly, and big
asset sales are in the pipeline as the group struggles for survival, with
trading losses running at IPounds 40m a year. Losses will be compounded this
year by IPounds 50m in extraordinary items - IPounds 20m in redundancy costs
and an IPounds 30m write-down on its shareholding in GPA, the aviation
leasing group.
Mr Mullan resigned following the announcement on Tuesday that Mr Bernie
Cahill, who was appointed group chairman in August 1991, has been appointed
by the government as executive chairman and been instructed by the minister
of transport to 'take whatever action necessary to restore the company to
commercial viability'.
Transport minister Brian Cowan indicated that such actions will include a
revision of air fares, the sale of non-core assets and across-the-board cost
reductions, which will involve the shedding of some 600 jobs out of a
worldwide workforce of 13,000.
Mr Mullan's head may not be the only one to eventually roll out of the
boardroom. But at the moment, the move to appoint Mr Cahill as the
executioner has the opposition crying 'scapegoat'.
Mr Michael Noonan, the transport spokesman for the opposition Fine Gael
party, said: 'It appears to have been a forced resignation. I would like to
see the minister making a fuller statement as to why Mr Cahill did not
appear to act as chairman for the past 18 months, and yet is now being asked
to act in a very short period of time . . . There seems to be a deliberate
attempt by the government to distance themselves from what is a very hot
political potato.'
Aer Lingus has been facing financial difficulties for several years - a
result of a too-rapid expansion of its fleet during the late 1980s,
coinciding with a downturn in air traffic triggered by the Gulf war and the
recessions in the US and UK. This has caused interest charges to soar, while
fare competition on its main routes has become intense.
Remedial action has not been taken sooner, however, due to a policy, pursued
by successive governments, that Aer Lingus should not simply be a national
air carrier, but should also be a tool of regional development policy within
Ireland.
For instance all transatlantic flights, including those of other airlines
into and out of Ireland, are obliged to make a stop-over at Shannon in the
west of the country. The company has argued strongly that this has put it at
a disadvantage with cheaper routes out of London. It also operates a number
of domestic routes which other carriers have pulled out of due to their lack
of profitability.
The airline carried 4.3m passengers last year on 43 routes in 11 countries.
Forty per cent of them were on the busy, but intensely competitive
Dublin-London route, while 400,000 travelled on transatlantic flights.
Average revenue per passenger kilometre was 9.2p in 1992, although for the
transatlantic routes this fell to 4.1p last year, while for the European
routes it was 13.4p.
A company spokesman said yesterday: 'Few of our routes could be described as
profitable at the moment.'
The government, however, wants to keep the present route structure, and
particularly the transatlantic ones, as intact as possible, preferring to
keep the core airline business up and running, while disposing of profitable
subsidiaries.
Most likely to come under the auctioneer's hammer is the group's chain of 14
hotels in the UK, which forms the Copthorne Hotel group, although in the
present economic climate in the UK, it is unlikely to get a good price for
them. Other possibilities include Team Aer Lingus, the six-hangar aircraft
maintenance facility in Dublin, although such a move would most likely face
stiff political opposition.
The Labour party, one of the partners in the coalition government, did
extraordinarily well in the last general election in the north Dublin area,
largely on the back of promises made to Aer Lingus workers that government
capital would be pumped into the airline to secure its survival.
In a country of already high unemployment, jobs has become a watch-word for
votes, and Aer Lingus has for years been the quintessential political
football. Unfortunately for Mr Mullan, who has served 36 years with the
group, now that the cost of that policy is no longer sustainable, he has
been the first to pay the price. It will be interesting to see which other
heads roll as Mr Cahill's axe falls.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cadbury Schweppes hits Pounds 333m -
Pre-Christmas boost and strong US performance behind advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUOYANT pre-Christmas trading in Britain and a strong performance in the US
helped Cadbury Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks manufacturer,
lift pre-tax profits 5.7 per cent to Pounds 332.7m over the 53 weeks to
January 2.
The result, which compares with Pounds 314.7m last time, was ahead of
analysts' forecasts. It was achieved in spite of a deterioration in
performance in continental European markets and the Pacific Rim region.
Sales rose to Pounds 3.37bn (Pounds 3.23bn).
Mr Dominic Cadbury, chief executive, said the improved trading in Britain
had continued in January and February. He did not expect the effects of
recession to be any worse in continental Europe this year and the company
had already acted to strengthen its operations there.
Changing competitive conditions were offering more opportunities for
acquisitions on the continent, which the company was well-placed to exploit.
'We see acquisitions, as opposed to organic growth, as a card we can play,'
he said.
Mr Cadbury added that the recent acquisition by Philip Morris, the large US
tobacco and food group, of Terry's, United Biscuits' chocolates division,
was unlikely to have much impact on Cadbury in the UK.
In the UK, a strong contribution from beverages lifted trading profit to
Pounds 172.6m (Pounds 160.2m), though a Pounds 14m restructuring charge
depressed the performance of confectionery. The Cadbury and Trebor Bassett
businesses increased market share, while Coca-Cola Schweppes Beverages
raised volumes.
In the Americas, trading profit advanced to Pounds 72.8m from Pounds 42.8m,
thanks to an 89 per cent rise in the results from beverage operations.
Carbonated drinks and Mott's juice performed well in the US, while Aguas
Minerales, the Mexican soft drinks company acquired last year, met
expectations.
In continental Europe, trading profit fell to Pounds 49m (Pounds 76.2m) on a
poorer performance by the soft drinks businesses. The company blamed
difficulties in the Spanish market, recession, poor summer weather, higher
marketing costs and a decline in sales through hotels, restaurants and
cafes. However, trading profit on confectionery rose 18 per cent.
In the Pacific Rim, trading profit slipped to Pounds 55.9m from Pounds
64.2m, due to effects of poor weather on beverage sales in Australia.
Marketing spending grew 13 per cent to Pounds 388m, though capital
expenditure fell 18 per cent to Pounds 191m. Net cash flow from operations
improved by Pounds 42m, while debt was reduced to Pounds 462m (Pounds 542m).
Earnings slipped to 26.81p (27.51p) but the final dividend is raised 6.5 per
cent to 9.9p, bringing the total to 13.2p (12.5p).

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wider use granted for Zeneca drug
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENECA, Imperial Chemical Industries' fully-owned bioscience subsidiary, has
received a licence in the US for Diprivan, its anaesthetic, to be used for
intensive care purposes.
The drug, one of Zeneca's three fastest-growing compounds, is already
available in the US for use for surgical applications. World-wide sales rose
by nearly 50 per cent last year to more than Pounds 140m.
Zeneca is stressing the need to obtain new indications for existing products
as a means of generating growth.
Dr Tom McKillop, Zeneca pharmaceuticals technical director, said recently
that the company expected seven new indications to be approved this year.
'Pharmaceutical R&amp;D is not only about submissions for new chemical entities.
You must ensure you get the very best from your existing products,' he said.
Zeneca's drug division needs its three newer products, Zestril, a heart
medicine, Zoladex, a cancer treatment and Diprivan to compensate for falling
sales of Tenormin, its heart drug.
In the 12 months after its US patents expired, American sales fell by about
50 per cent.
ICI shareholders will vote in May on whether Zeneca should be completely
separated from ICI.
Zeneca is scheduled to make a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue in June.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Medeva surges to Pounds 36m following
hectic year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEDEVA, the rapidly growing pharmaceuticals company, yesterday reported a 47
per cent increase in earnings per share after a hectic year of corporate
activity that saw sales rise 75 per cent.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-December surged from Pounds 16.7m
to Pounds 36m, on sales of Pounds 144.2m.
Fully diluted earnings per share increased from 8.3p to 12.2p.
The recommended final dividend goes up by 50 per cent to 1.5p, making a
total of 2.25p (1.5p) for the year.
Mr Bernard Taylor, chairman, said Medeva was in a 'transition from an
association of acquired businesses into a much more integrated
(prescription-based) pharmaceutical company.'
Acquisitions and investment meant a net cash position of Pounds 40.7m turned
into net debt of Pounds 34.2m, giving gearing of 47 per cent at the year-end
after generating Pounds 34.2m from operations.
Interest was covered 27 times by operating profit.
Gross margins increased by 10 percentage points to 55 per cent but the tax
rate jumped from 18 per cent to 30 per cent and is heading for 33 per cent
this year.
Mr Taylor said it was difficult to identify exactly the level of organic
growth but that it was in excess of 20 per cent.
This growth was a measure of the quality of the products and the marketing
organisations Medeva has bought with a number of its acquisitions.
'We are obtaining synergies,' said Mr Taylor. 'Not one of our acquisitions
is on the basis that it would be additive.'
The group was continuing to put in place the building blocks for a
significant pharmaceuticals company and would, therefore, be making
acquisitions through the issue of new shares rather than more debt.
Medeva still needed geographical coverage in Germany, Italy and the Benelux
countries and would be looking for new product lines and products that were
nearing the end of their development process.
COMMENT
Medeva's relative under-performance in the last eight months is surprising
for a company doubling profits and lifting earnings by 47 per cent. On
profits forecast at Pounds 50m this year, or 14.7p of earnings, the shares
still trade at only a modest premium to the market. But Medeva is weighed
down by special factors that go beyond membership of an out-of-favour
sector. Firstly, pharmaceuticals investors are unused to such quick-fire
acquisition and remain, frankly, uncertain of the quality of organic growth.
On top of this lingering incredulity is a more traditional fear - that
Medeva will make another big acquisition soon and reduce debt through a
sizeable rights issue. On both counts, now may be the time to reassess.
Underlying growth appears to be reaping benefits in the US - although Mrs
Clinton's health reforms may yet surprise. And investors should remember
that, to date at least, Medeva has deployed its rights proceeds to great
effect, even if the acquisitions have obscured the organic growth.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hanson link adds to Shanks landfill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US conglomerate, has taken a 4.7 per cent stake in Shanks
&amp; McEwan, the waste management group, and has granted in return additional
rights at existing landfill sites.
The deal, worth Pounds 18m in shares and Pounds 2.2m for the assumption of
certain liabilities, will give Shanks access to an additional 21.7m cu m of
void at four sites in Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire and Cambridgeshire.
Mr Roger Hewitt, chief executive, said the acquisition would provide a
continuity of landfill operations at two of the sites into the next century.
It is unusual for Hanson to take minority stakes in companies, but it is not
the first time the conglomerate has been on Shanks' register.
In 1986 when it sold London Brick Landfill to Shanks, Hanson retained a 20
per cent stake in the business which it held until 1991. Mr Hewitt welcomed
Hanson back as a shareholder.
The deal will be dilutive for Shanks in the first year as it is issuing
8.73m ordinary shares to Hanson.
Shanks will also be paying 15 per cent of revenues to Hanson from disposal
of waste in the acquired void.
The company handles more than 7m tonnes of waste a year and now has 85.2m cu
m of consented landbank, after the addition of 9m cu m just acquired from
Hanson.
Shanks has an option to buy a unconsented void from Hanson in Bedfordshire
for an additional Pounds 7.25m cash.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rolls-Royce shows Pounds 20m loss as sales
decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE Motor Cars, the luxury car subsidiary of Vickers, the UK
engineering group, suffered a trading loss of more than Pounds 20m in 1992,
against more than Pounds 30m in 1991.
Retail sales of the group's Rolls-Royce and Bentley cars plunged by 20 per
cent worldwide to 1,378 (1,713).
Sales have dropped by 58.7 per cent in the last two years, from 3,333 in
1990.
The luxury cars operation has been drastically restructured with a cut in
the workforce from 5,500 at end-1990 to less than 2,500 at end-1992.
Sir Colin Chandler, Vickers chief executive, said that the Rolls-Royce
break-even level had been reduced to about 1,300 cars a year from double
this level in 1990.
After incurring trading losses of about Pounds 54m and exceptional
restructuring costs of Pounds 49.6m in the past two years, Rolls-Royce Motor
Cars was expected to break even in 1993 with forecast sales of about 1,350
cars, he said.
Car production fell last year to only 1,258, from 1,620 in 1991 and 3,274 in
1990.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars' financial performance has deteriorated rapidly after
achieving an operating profit of Pounds 32m in 1990, when wholesale car
deliveries exceeded 3,200.
Sir Colin said that the luxury cars subsidiary was now 'well-placed to
benefit strongly from any sustained increase in demand from current
depressed levels' in the wake of the two-year rationalisation programme.
'Even a modest upturn in key markets will help restore profitability.
Last year Rolls-Royce and Bentley sales fell by 63 per cent in Japan to 91
(248), while in the UK they fell by 23 per cent to 380 and in continental
Europe by 26 per cent to 294. Sales in North America rose by 1 per cent to
412.
Sir Colin said that Rolls-Royce Motor Cars was still working a four-day week
with no output on Fridays. Production could be raised to about 2,000 cars a
year without any increase in the present workforce.
He added that the group was still ruling out the development of a new model
range in the medium-term but would continue with 'evolutionary engineering'
of the present range.
The priority was to return Rolls-Royce to profitability, but in the
longer-term Vickers would again look for a partner to share the development
costs of a new model range.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Strong tobacco side lifts BAT to Pounds 1.65bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER and RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in BAT Industries rose 18p to 955p yesterday after the tobacco and
financial services group reported annual pre-tax profits up 68 per cent to
Pounds 1.65bn, which was at the top end of City expectations. Turnover grew
7 per cent to Pounds 22.1bn.
The figures were attributed to an unexpectedly strong fourth quarter by the
group's buoyant international tobacco business, and the continuing reduction
in losses from Eagle Star, the UK insurance subsidiary which has been hit
hard by mortgage indemnity losses.
Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman, said the performance of Farmers, the group's
US insurance subsidiary, was a highlight. It had become the third largest
general insurer in the US, and its life business had contributed Pounds 93m
to a trading profit above Pounds 400m.
Farmers and Eagle Star helped financial services' trading profit from
continuing operations to recover from Pounds 230m to Pounds 598m.
Losses from mortgage indemnity insurance - which covers lenders against a
portion of their losses on sales of repossessed properties - amounted to
Pounds 244m. This was mainly because Eagle Star increased its provisions
against claims on policies insuring commercial property lenders, a class of
business it no longer underwrites.
Losses on domestic mortgage indemnity policies fell to Pounds 97m, compared
with Pounds 213m in 1991.
Higher premiums and more selective underwriting led to a sharp fall in Eagle
Star's underwriting losses in motor, home and commercial insurances.
The group's tobacco trading profit increased by 24 per cent to Pounds
1.31bn. Total volumes rose to more than 570bn cigarettes, increasing the
group's share of the world market to 10.9 per cent.
Sales of international brands grew by 19 per cent, while export volumes were
23 per cent higher. As the most international cigarette maker, BAT continued
to increase its share in key domestic markets around the world and to expand
into newly emerging markets such as eastern Europe.
Earnings per share more than doubled to 58.7p. The group's tax rate fell
from 56.5 per cent to 41.5 per cent, mainly due to the improvement in UK
profitability. A final dividend of 22.6p (against 11.2p) gives a total for
the year of 37.2p, up 11 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Stock exchange takes a matador to Taurus / Analysis of the
history of one of the City's biggest computer projects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER more than a decade of planning and an estimated Pounds 400m spent on
its development, London's planned share settlement system ranks as one of
the biggest computer projects ever conceived in the City. Could it really
all be scrapped?
Yes, if the London Stock Exchange's board agrees with a proposal to be put
to it today by its chief executive, Mr Peter Rawlins.
The technical difficulties standing in the way of completing the project are
just too big, he will say: it is better to start again from scratch than to
go on.
Most of the big banks, brokers and registrars in the City, which have spent
large sums on Taurus in recent years, were unaware yesterday of the likely
demise of the project. The news prompted anguish, anger, recrimination: in
the aftermath of today's meeting, it is likely to send reverberations
throughout City boardrooms. Mr John Lamb, in charge of share registration
and custody business at National Westminster, summed up the mood: 'For the
City, it would be a very, very sad thing. Hells bells, we've got one of the
least attractive settlement systems of any major stock market.'
The system for settling share transactions has become one of the main
battlegrounds in the competition between European financial centres, and is
the area where London comes out worst. The process of exchanging shares for
cash is slow - it takes up to three weeks - and cumbersome, with a series of
paper-based administration procedures needed for each share sale.
Taurus - which stands for the transfer and automated registration of
uncertificated stock - was meant to end all that, enabling London to
leapfrog its rivals into a leading position internationally. A decision to
terminate it now would prove a fittingly spectacular end to a troubled
history.
The idea that share ownership should be transferred like money in the
banking system, through computerised book entries on a computer, was first
put forward by a stock exchange committee in the early 1980s. In the rush to
build a new trading infrastructure for the stock market in time for Big Bang
in October 1986, though, the decidely unglamorous area of settlement was put
to one side.
The idea was rekindled in 1986, as Big Bang and soaring share prices drew
small shareholders into the stock market, leading to an explosion in the
number of share transactions passing through the market and a backlog of
unsettled bargains that at one stage reached Pounds 3bn. With Bank of
England prodding, renewed efforts were made to build an automated book-entry
system.
If any one decision can be blamed for the quagmire into which the Taurus
development has become bogged down, it was the abandonment in 1988 of a plan
for a Pounds 60m central database to maintain records of all shareholdings
in the UK stock market.
Also, the registrars who maintain records of shareholdings in the UK feared
that the stock exchange would itself become a central registrar, putting
them out of business.
The result was a compromise, designed to protect the interests of the many
users of the London stock market - registrars and custodians, offering share
maintenance services to companies and investors, as well as listed companies
 -who wanted a transparent system for share ownership that enabled them to
identify who owned their shares. The Department of Trade and Industry, keen
to protect small shareholders, pushed for levels of security and investor
protection that professionals grumbled were unnecessary.
As Mr Mike Jones, head of development at brokers Capel Cure Myers, said
yesterday: 'We tried to leave the present relationships in place, and design
a system around it.' The conclusion of the head of operations at one London
investment bank was briefer: 'We've ended up with a camel.'
The Taurus plan is based on a series of databases around the City maintained
by brokers, bankers, custodians, investors and registrars, each of which
holds records of shareholdings. The databases were to be linked on an
electronic network, making it possible both to transfer stock between them
and to take an overall picture of a particular company's shareholdings.
It is now clear that this system, finally adopted in 1989, was far more
complex than anyone had predicted. First, the Department of Trade and
Industry took more than a year to amend UK company law to recognise
automated transfer of share ownership. Those legal changes were implemented
to fit the Taurus system: it was unclear yesterday whether they would suit
any other automated share transfer system that may succeed it.
Technical difficulties have brought Taurus to the brink of failure. Testing
of the stock exchange's own system, which acts as a central hub for the
network, began last October.
Wider testing, involving securities firms, started in January. This process,
expected to be the simplest part of a test cycle lasting until at least the
end of the year, has already fallen behind.
The stock exchange admitted yesterday that the testing has been 'slow and
patchy'. One broking firm said that, rather than the 154 functions that were
meant to have been tested when the latest phase began in January, only 50
have been tried.
If Taurus is scrapped, what could follow?
'It's all very well people knocking Taurus - but is there an alternative
being proposed?' said Ms Alison Renison, head of Taurus development at
Barclays. 'Whatever happens, the UK has to have a book-entry system.'
During the years that London has been working on Taurus, other financial
centres have moved quickly to enhance their share settlement systems.
Frankfurt now boasts share settlement in less than the three-day cycle
recommended by G30, the Washington-based think tank, and Paris last year
moved to an automated system.
With computing costs now far lower than they were five years ago, there were
already voices yesterday urging a return to the relatively simple solution
of a central database for the stock market. Whether City vested interests
can be reconciled to make a quick and cheap solution possible this time
around remains to be seen.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Vickers doubles its loss to Pounds 25.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VICKERS, the UK engineering group, fell to a pre-tax loss of Pounds 25.9m
last year, double the loss of the previous year, under the impact of a
further steep fall in sales of its Rolls-Royce and Bentley luxury cars.
The company is launching a one for four share issue to raise Pounds 60.5m to
bolster its balance sheet, which has been weakened by exceptional
restructuring charges of Pounds 65.8m in the last two years. The dividend
for the year has been cut to 1.5p, from 6p in 1991 and 9.9p in 1990. The
share price rallied yesterday to close up 6p at 124p. The new shares will be
priced at 95p per share, and the issue will be underwritten by Lazard
Brothers.
Vickers' pre-tax loss of Pounds 25.9m had risen from a deficit of Pounds
12.4m a year earlier under the impact of exceptional charges of Pounds
31.4m, including restructuring costs of Pounds 30.1m.
Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, the group's loss-making luxury car subsidiary,
accounted for re-structuring costs of Pounds 18.2m following exceptional
charges of Pounds 31.4m in 1991. Vickers also suffered restructuring costs
of Pounds 4.6m at Cantieri Riva, its Italian luxury powerboat business.
Group turnover rose to Pounds 718.5m from Pounds 652.2m in 1991, while
trading profits fell to Pounds 12.6m from Pounds 20.9m.
The automotive engineering operations, which include Rolls-Royce Motor Cars,
Cosworth engines and Riva, incurred trading losses of Pounds 15.8m compared
with Pounds 17.3m in 1991, while trading profits at the defence and
aerospace components division fell 13.9 per cent to Pounds 13.6m.
Under the impact of the group's rising debts, net interest costs rose to
Pounds 7.1m compared with net interest income of Pounds 1.1m in 1991. Sir
Colin Chandler, chief executive, said the group had suffered 'exceptionally
severe trading conditions in its major markets over the last two years'.
Vickers had net debts of Pounds 100.1m at the end of 1992 compared with
cash, net of borrowings, of Pounds 11.5m at the end of 1990, while
shareholders' funds had contracted from Pounds 271.5m to Pounds 206.4m over
the same period.
Vickers' gearing had risen to nearly 50 per cent by the end of 1992, but Sir
Colin said the rights issue would reduce the gearing to about 15 per cent.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Lucas seeks top successors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS INDUSTRIES yesterday moved to sort out the succession problem which
has made the UK engineering group one of the City's prime targets for
takeover speculation.
The Midlands-based car and aerospace components group, said it would appoint
a new chief executive as soon as possible and hoped a new non-executive
chairman would be nominated to take over from Sir Anthony Gill, the
62-year-old chairman and chief executive, by the time of November's annual
general meeting.
Lucas also announced the appointment of three non-executive directors - Mr
Richard Giordano, 58, former chairman and chief executive of BOC; Sir
Alistair Morton, 55, chief executive of Eurotunnel; and Mr Paul Bosonnet,
60, deputy chairman of BT.
Mr Giordano will take over the chairmanship of the board's nominations
committee, which is considering a shortlist for the post of chief executive.
This suggests he is the leading candidate to take over from Sir Anthony, who
had agreed in October that he would stay on for another two years as
chairman.
Lucas said yesterday that the search for a new chairman and a chief
executive this year was designed to reassure the City, which was concerned
by recent botched succession plans.
In February last year, Mr Tony Edwards, head of the aerospace division, was
made chief executive designate. In March Mr David Hankinson, then finance
director who had been considered for the top job, left with compensation of
Pounds 352,000. In August Mr Edwards was told the board did not consider him
to be suitable for the post as chief executive, and in October he moved to
rival TI Group.
Sir Anthony denied then any reluctance to hand over the reins and the group
yesterday insisted that his departure was not being brought forward because
of concerns that he might clash with a new chief executive. The new board
appointments will replace Sir Colin Southgate, Thorn EMI chairman, and Mr
Philippe Souviron, chairman of Bankers Trust (France). Lucas shares touched
a five-year low of 78p in September, valuing the group at Pounds 550m. Lucas
reported a fall in annual pre-tax profits from Pounds 82.8m to Pounds 22.5m
in October but the shares have since recovered to 142p, fuelled partly by
takeover speculation.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Bombay securities scandal cost Standard Chartered Pounds
305m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered, the UK bank, yesterday disclosed that it had sustained a
Pounds 305m loss on Indian operations last year after it raised its
provision for possible bad debts resulting from the Bombay securities
trading scandal to Pounds 272m.
The India loss, boosted by a fresh Pounds 160m general provision in the
second half, was offset by an exceptional gain of Pounds 111m from selling
properties, and doubled trading profits in the Asia Pacific region of Pounds
382m (against Pounds 184m in 1991).
The bank's pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 205m to Pounds 202m as its total
charge for possible bad debts rose to Pounds 366m (against Pounds 159m). Its
trading loss in the UK and Europe rose to Pounds 64.4m, against Pounds 46.5m
in 1991. The group made a Pounds 100m interim provision against the Bombay
scandal, which rose in value to Pounds 112m because of exchange rate
movements.
Mr Rodney Galpin, Standard Chartered chairman, said there was 'no quick
solution' to the affair. Mr Galpin, who will retire in May, said the India
problem meant that the group's results were 'far less good than I would have
wished'.
In spite of the Bombay losses, which mean the group is now 80 per cent
provided against its gross exposure of Pounds 343m, shares rose by 25p to
716p on expectations of rapid profits growth in future helped by the
buoyancy of Asian operations.
The group proposed an unchanged final dividend of 13p, making a total of 20p
for the year. Its earnings per share after the exceptional gain from selling
properties in Asia fell to 29p, against 44.3p.
The ratio of tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets fell to 4.9 per cent
from 5 per cent because of sterling's depreciation against the US dollar. Mr
Galpin said it might issue up to Dollars 300m of preference shares 'at some
time in the future'.
Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said he had 'no reason to believe
that the India situation was other than a unique and isolated event'.
Fifteen staff had left, including three in London, and a further six had
been reprimanded.
The value of Indian securities held as collateral fell from Pounds 63m at
the half-year to Pounds 34m at the year-end.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Major braced for further Maastricht defeats
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is braced for as many as five further defeats on Labour
amendments to the Maastricht bill in the wake of Monday's setback, a cabinet
minister conceded yesterday.
Although none of the amendments would halt British ratification of the
treaty, they would undoubtedly undermine further the government's authority
and sap morale among loyalist pro-Maastricht MPs.
Amid fresh Conservative party rows over Maastricht following Monday's
defeat, when Labour, Liberal Democrat and Tory rebels scored a 22-vote
victory over the government, the minister said: 'The ship can take on some
water. So long as it stays on course, that is what matters.'
The 'Positive Europeans' group of Tory MPs last night wrote to the chairman
of the party's backbench 1922 committee complaining about executive members
who have voted against the government.
However, Mr John Major has taken a strategic decision not to antagonise Tory
Euro-rebels, believing many are fighting over what they see as genuine
points of principle. He is anxious to maintain Conservative unity in the
long term, not least in nine months' time when the Maastricht legislation
should be passed.
Amid chaotic scenes, Labour MPs disrupted Commons' business last night with
procedural votes in pre-emptive retaliation against the threat of the
government trying to extend today's resumed debate on Maastricht into Friday
or beyond. Labour has said that all its MPs will remain at Westminster if
proceedings do continue into the weekend, even at the expense of the party's
Scottish conference in Inverness.
Ministers, who are playing down the significance of Monday's vote, appear
ready to leave the arm-twisting of Tory rebels to loyalist backbench
colleagues who are expected to resume their criticisms at a 1922 committee
meeting today.
In practice, surveys of Conservative constituency association chairmen -
showing many supportive of the rebels - reveal there is little the prime
minister can do to contain the revolt.
Leaders of the Euro-sceptics were unbowed yesterday, saying they could
support at least some of Labour's amendments, including one on the social
chapter. Although there is evidence of some splits among the rebels, tactics
are also being kept secret.
The government's vulnerability has, meanwhile, markedly raised morale on the
Labour benches, following its victory on Monday. But Mr John Smith, the
Labour party leader, yesterday made clear that the opposition would do
nothing to prevent eventual ratification of the accord.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Amato wins confidence vote after stormy Senate debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S embattled prime minister Mr Giuliano Amato won the backing yesterday
of the four partners in the fragile coalition government after a turbulent
parliamentary debate on his moves to find a political solution to the
corruption scandals.
Scuffles broke out during the debate when an opposition senator threw
handfuls of false banknotes - bearing the effigies of some of the main
figures involved in the corruption scandal - into the Senate chamber.
A later vote of confidence appeared to defuse some of the political tension
that has built up since the dramatic events of last weekend when President
Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign a decree. This would have allowed most
of those implicated in the corruption scandals to get off with
administrative sanctions.
But Mr Amato's weariness from battling to keep alive his eight-month old
coalition showed yesterday when he revealed he would quit politics once he
stepped down from the premiership. 'The end of this experience as prime
minister - come as it may within days, a month or whenever - will also be
the end of my political career,' he said.
Mr Amato also castigated the hypocrisy of those clamouring for him to
resign. 'How can one go on when one gets private entreaties to stay and
public calls to go?' he asked.
In an impassioned speech, frequently interrupted by the opposition, he also
spoke bitterly against those who had encouraged a political solution to the
corruption scandals but had withdrawn to the sidelines once the proposals
proved unpopular with the public and the judiciary.
The government now has to reframe legislation to enable the judiciary to
deal more quickly with the increasing load of investigations and
prosecutions in the corruption scandals.
But Mr Amato yesterday said his government's top priority was to ensure that
parliament agreed quickly on a new set of electoral laws. Ms Nilde Iotti,
the former leader of the chamber of deputies and a member of the opposition
Party of the Democratic Left, was yesterday appointed head of the joint
parliamentary commission on constitutional reform.
In his Senate speech, Mr Amato denied the government's proposals had
amounted to an amnesty for the corruptors and corrupted. But he conceded it
had been a mistake to frame the proposals in a decree against the advice of
Mr Giovanni Conso, the justice minister, rather than as a law which could be
amended by parliamentary debate.
Mr Scalfaro invoked the formal excuse that the decree, which covered new
provisions on party financing, would have conflicted with the referendum on
April 18 calling for the abolition of public funding of political parties.
But it has become clear that the opposition of the Milan magistrates
involved in the main anti-corruption investigations forced Friday's cabinet
decision to be overturned by Mr Scalfaro.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Ford attacks Japanese rivals: UK job losses blamed on
'transplant factories' as staff back strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE motor companies with plants in Britain were partially blamed
yesterday by Mr Ian McAllister, Ford UK's chairman and managing director,
for his company's threat to make compulsory redundancies.
His strong attack, in written evidence to the House of Commons employment
committee, coincided with a vote yesterday by Ford's white-collar staff to
authorise a strike if compulsory redundancies go ahead.
Leaders of manual unions meet Ford management today to discuss how
compulsory redundancies will affect their members. If Ford refuses to back
down, the manual unions are also expected to ballot for strike action.
Mr McAllister told MPs: 'With the growing presence of Japanese transplant
assembly facilities in Britain operating with the advantages of a greenfield
site and extremely low levels of engineering and manufacturing integration,
it should not be surprising that an established company such as Ford must
shed labour to ensure its future competitiveness and prosperity.'
He warned of future job losses in the UK motor industry be-cause of Japanese
companies, ac-cusing them of 'creating excess capacity which, given a market
of finite size, is likely to displace equivalent jobs in existing
producers', as well as 'having generally lower local content levels which
displaces jobs at both manufacturers and suppliers'.
He said: 'Their products and components are wholly designed and developed in
Japan and must give rise to real concerns for the UK's technological base.'
Mr McAllister said that in what he called the 'Japanese transplant
factories', the 'integration levels for design and manufacture are
significantly below those of established producers'.
Under questioning from MPs, he warned of the danger of a technological
brain-drain to Japan. 'Within a few years, the technical expertise which
exists today in the UK supply base may no longer be capable of supporting
the long-range research and development requirements of the motor industry.
The suppliers will become no more than 'makers' of Japanese design parts.'
In oral evidence to MPs, Ford's senior management said 262 more staff jobs
had to go by April 16, of 2,100 called for in December while 318 more manual
workers were required to accept voluntary redundancy out of the 1,180
originally needed. This suggests Ford might reach its manpower cut target
without the need for compulsory redundancies.
In the ballot of Ford's 10,000 white-collar staff at its 21 UK plants, 50
per cent of 6,500 members of the Manufacturing, Scientific and Finance Union
voted - 64 per cent supporting the strike call. The vote among white-collar
members of the TGWU general union was much narrower - 53 per cent were ready
to back a strike. Staff union officials will meet Ford on March 23 to
discuss the issue.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Palestinians reject plea on peace talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Palestinians yesterday refused to accept an invitation by the US and
Russia, co-sponsors of the Middle East peace process, to attend negotiations
in Washington on April 20.
Israel immediately accepted the invitation, while Jordan, Syria and Lebanon
are likely to delay a response until after a meeting of foreign ministers in
Damascus later this month.
Mrs Hanan Ashrawi, spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation, said in
Jerusalem that the invitation had been returned to the American consulate.
'We refused to accept it', she said.
Despite this, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, remained
confident that all the delegations would be in Washington on April 20.
Mr Christopher added that he had decided to move ahead with separate
multilateral regional Middle East talks beginning with a meeting on water
issues in Geneva on April 22.
The Palestinians based their rejection on Israel's refusal to comply fully
with UN Security Council Resolution 799 calling for the return of the nearly
400 men deported from the occupied territories to southern Lebanon in
December. While softening its insistence that all the deportees should be
returned home before peace negotiations could resume, the Palestinians are
demanding a public assurance from Israel that there will be no more mass
deportations.
Mr Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian in the occupied territories,
stressed in London that the principle of deportations was the issue that had
to be resolved.
Britain yesterday gave its backing to the Palestinian stance on
deportations. Mr Douglas Hogg, a minister at the Foreign Office, told
parliament: 'It is essential that the Israeli government should make it
plain that they do not intend to resort in the future to the policy of
deportation.' He added that the Israeli government should also 'look
urgently at other ways in which they can lift the weight of the occupation'
of Gaza and the West Bank.
Mr Hogg will deliver this message directly to Israel today when he meets Mr
Yossi Beilin, the deputy foreign minister. Mr Beilin is expected to repeat
his government's objection to Britain's resumption this week of ministerial
contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organisation.
Mr Husseini emphasised that the Palestinians were committed to negotiations
and talks could resume on April 20 'if there is a will from the Israeli
side'.

FT  11 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Vickers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a brutal simplicity about Vickers' rights issue. Shareholders
wondering where their Pounds 60m will go need look no further than the
Pounds 66m hole punched in the balance sheet by exceptional charges in the
past two years. The recession has ruthlessly proved that Vickers is simply
not big enough to cope with Rolls-Royce Motors' profit swings.
It need not have been that way. Vickers came into the recession with no net
debt and could have negotiated a good price for Rolls in 1990. But having
set its face against Sir Ron Brierley's unrealistic demerger plan, the board
hesitated too long about an outright sale. After this, there is precious
little point in looking for a buyer until Rolls wins back its spurs.
However little the management deserves the rights cash, the involvement of
Cazenove will surely be enough to ram the issue home. Tanks should provide
steady medium-term income and, now costs have been cut, the short-term
recovery potential is there. What remains shrouded is the long-term future
of expensive hand-built vehicles such as the Bentley Continental and the
Challenger tank.

FT  11 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: BAT Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Tobacco stocks are the forgotten casualty of Mr Clinton's presidency. BAT
Industries has underperformed the market by 13 per cent since a new excise
duty on tobacco was proposed. Yesterday's full-year figures suggest the
market should not be too alarmed. Although BAT earns a large chunk of
profits from US tobacco, cigarette exports to eastern Europe and Asia grew
by more than 20 per cent last year. Only the most onerous of new taxes would
knock BAT's tobacco business off its stride. Besides, tobacco companies have
off-set previous falls in volume sales by widening margins under the cover
of higher taxation.
The fly in the ointment is Eagle Star's exposure to the UK housing market.
With tobacco strong and Farmers insurance expanding in the US, though, the
drag on profits is hardly noticeable. On a 30 per cent yield premium to the
market average, the shares will look cheap if Mr Clinton's bark turns out to
be worse than his bite.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cadbury has the kind of problems most other UK food manufacturers would
envy. Its strong brands and resilient results highlight the possibilities
for considerable international growth. But management's attention may now
focus on mainland Europe, which represented the only serious blemish in
Cadbury's performance. The 36 per cent fall in trading profits was
attributable to beverages. But Cadbury also faces a long-term strategic bind
in confectionery, where it lags well behind Mars and Nestle. Philip Morris's
recent purchase of Terry's suggests pressure will intensify in the UK. A
sizeable acquisition may represent the only means of acquiring sufficient
mass.
This, though, raises the tricky issue of funding, even supposing a suitable
target could be found. Cadbury has never generated as much cash as its high
margins would suggest and the balance sheet has been hollowed out by
goodwill write-offs. Equity funding must remain a possibility. This may
partly explain the company's surprisingly sunny view of the UK economy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oh dear, oh dear] Standard Chartered just cannot seem to manage a year
without finding a banana skin to tread on. The latest one - the securities
scandal in Bombay - has cost more than Pounds 300m, much more than Standard
expected at the half year. Exchange movements have since aggravated the
problem and weak local financial markets have eaten into its collateral, but
at least the bank has not suddenly discovered any new exposure. Its higher
provision reflects a more sober reflection of what it can recover from the
wreckage in a country where it is unpopular and singularly lacking in
influence.
Strip away India, though, and it is easy to see why the market greeted
yesterday's results by pushing the shares up 3 per cent. Other net
provisions may grow this year, simply because there will be no repeat of the
recoveries from GPI Leisure and MiniScribe. Yet operating earnings are
steaming ahead and the tax rate, which has been pushed up by the Indian
general provision and unrelieved ACT, should come down. Standard's dividend
costs only Pounds 47m. Even after a large real increase, it should have
enough retained earnings to push its tier one capital well over 5 per cent.
On that basis, the shares are cheap, but only because rational analysis does
not allow for the kind of nasty surprise which has become a Standard
Chartered hallmark.

FT  11 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Horns of a dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Stock Exchange faces the unhappy decision whether to stick with
its ill-fated Taurus paperless trading and settlement system or abandon the
project as a bad job. Turning back now would be a startling admission of
failure. In addition to the Pounds 75m development cost incurred by the
Exchange itself, City brokers and banks have spent much more. One can only
hope these costs have been written off as incurred. The Exchange certainly
has some explaining to do about why the project has been allowed to drag on
at such expense for so long, but it was members and users who insisted on
the project being so complicated.
The London equity market cannot afford to wait indefinitely for an overhaul.
A simplified version of Taurus built around a central database - rather than
the complex distributed databases now proposed - would be less of a
technological challenge. That would mean going back to something like the
original 1987 proposals for Taurus. Doubtless there would be resistence to
the idea. Registrars, for example, might view such a system as a threat.
The attempt to replicate every last nuance of existing arrangements has
proved unacceptably costly and slow. If the exchange cannot reconcile the
conflicting interests, the Bank of England should knock heads together.
There is a strong case for moving quickly to rolling settlement even without
Taurus. Frankfurt is already well down this path, and the City is being left
behind.

Why the extravagance of new curtains at the Moorgate Place headquarters of
the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales? The better to
hide its substantial reserves while clamouring for swingeing subscription
increases, according to the buzz.
Although members grudgingly accepted a rise for this year, they're jibbing
about doing likewise for each of the next two.
So even if that isn't curtains for the institute's plans for further
increases, perhaps they'll be shaded down.

High unemployment is evidently proving good business for some, and on an
international scale. Witness, for example, the 30 would-be workers from
South Africa marooned in Bahrain.
Having been offered lucrative locally advertised oil-rig jobs in Kuwait with
'Offshore International', they each handed the supposed company's agent
nearly Pounds 5,000 for travel costs and a 'character premium' to ensure
they would serve for a given time.
The organiser travelled with them part-way, promising that a courier would
be waiting in Bahrain to take them to the site. When he failed to
materialise, they checked and discovered there was no such company, and of
course no jobs.
But the con artist responsible, who had an Australian accent and claimed
Irish origins, seems unlikely to be the same conman wanted for interview by
the British police. Styling himself D A Baxter, he has been purporting to
recruit sales staff for Euro Disney, asking applicants for advance payments
to cover costs.
With convincingly English restraint, however, he is charging only Pounds
6.75 a head.

A nice little earner could be in the offing for ex-Granada chief executive
Derek Lewis, now gone from the leisure and entertainments industry to inject
entrepreneurship into the UK prison service.
With its rebirth as a free-standing agency only three weeks away, the
service is afflicted with a problem more often found in show business - how
to drag them in. With no fewer than 7,000 vacancies in its cells, according
to an internal briefing document, the service is operating well below
capacity.
True, the prison population has risen by 2,000 since the count of just over
40,000 in December. But that is merely a normal seasonal increase, the
document says; the potential captive audience that once awaited in police
station cells has run out. So what to do?
While wanting the service to be more entrepreneurial, the government might
draw the line at a campaign to promote a capacity-filling crime-wave. And
although prisons' running expenses are only a quarter of the police-cell
figure, their daily cost of about Pounds 60 a customer would price them out
of the standard hotel market.
Considering Lewis's background, however, a solution should certainly not be
beyond him. One obvious possibility is to follow the theme park trend. After
all, the Dartmoor Experience could well prove as big a draw as the London
Dungeon.

WHAT SORT of trade policy will the US follow under President Clinton? There
can be few more important questions.
When Mr Clinton said last month that 'we must compete, not retreat', who
could forbear a cheer? When he says that 'if we believe in the bonds of
democracy, we must resolve to strengthen the bonds of commerce,' the cheers
become louder. And when he says that he wants to see completion of the
Uruguay Round by the end of this year, they become deafening.
Yet Mr Clinton also believes that trade needs to be 'a priority element of
American security' and that 'many of our trading partners cling to unfair
practices'. Lawyer that he is, he knows the solution: 'we must enforce our
trade laws and our agreements with all the tools and energy at our
disposal'.
Market opening and unilateral pursuit of 'fairness' are not, as Mr Clinton
seems to believe, two sides of the same coin. They are two different coins,
the latter being intellectually counterfeit. First, 'fairness' is in the
eyes of the beholder, the US being just one, if the biggest, of more than
one hundred such beholders; second, much of what is deemed unfair is not
economically damaging, while remedies for unfairness too often are; third,
US trade policy is unfair too, among the most important examples being the
very laws that Mr Clinton is so determined to see enforced.
That these laws are unfair should not be a controversial statement, other
than to those who benefit from them. So-called fair trade laws render
illegal practices, such as differential pricing, that are perfectly legal
within the domestic economy; they find against practices, such as charging
less than long run average cost, which are economically efficient; and they
find price discrimination where the same prices are being charged in
different markets. This is true not only of the US, but of others as well,
not least of the European Community.
The Uruguay Round is of great importance. Yet, as the EC itself must have
realised after the recent provisional imposition of anti-dumping duties on
its steel exports to the US, the Uruguay Round is a small part of the trade
story. Fair trade measures may well more than offset the benefits of the
round as a whole.
What is to be done? A starting point must be to question whether the game is
worth the candle. Mrs Carla Hills, the outgoing US trade representative,
asked the International Trade Commission to study the economic effects of US
anti-dumping and countervailing duty laws. Mr Clinton could do much to allay
the world's fears about the drift of US trade policy, not to mention reduce
costs imposed on the US economy, if he were to welcome that study. For its
part, the EC should promise a similar study into its equally controversial
policies. The pursuit of self-defined 'fair trade' has become the canker at
the heart of the trading system. It needs to be excised.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Leading Article: A strike too far for Germany
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SAGA of eastern Germany's forced integration into a market economy
during the last 2 1/2 years has not been a happy one. If IG Metall, the
metal-workers' union, goes ahead with strikes to pursue a 26 per cent wage
rise in the east German engineering industry, the story could become a
tragedy.
West Germany's consensus-based industrial system has in the past succeeded
in sharing out equitably the rewards accruing to a society registering
steady economic growth. Confronted with the necessity of several years of
belt-tightening in the west, and a still longer period of restructuring in
the east, the system now looks much less able to cope.
The 26 per cent wage rise was agreed in March 1991. This was part of an
overall policy, promoted by the Bonn government, for realtively fast
alignment of east and west German living standards. There is now a clear
case for lengthening the timetable for eastern wage increases. During the
last two years, over-rapid wage rises, by depressing competitiveness in a
region of chronically low productivity, have accelerated east Germany's
industrial destruction.
Yet the two sides remain far apart. Mr Franz Steinkuhler, the IG Metall
leader, believes protecting the wage contract has repercussions for western
wage negotiations. The union also argues that east German labour costs are
lower than employers claim, taking into account longer working hours and
lower fringe benefits. Employers, by contrast, say a 26 per cent pay rise
would damage already fragile eastern manufacturing.
A rise going much beyond the 9 per cent so far offered would increase east
Germany's 15 per cent unemployment rate, itself an under-estimate of true
unemployment. East German hopes that Bonn will bail out hard-hit eastern
industrial groups, irrespective of the cost, are quite unrealistic.
Furthermore, far from safeguarding Germany's collective bargaining system,
IG Metall's campaign could undermine it. Many east German employers are
already opting out of the tariff system by undercutting centrally-set wage
levels. An unrealistic pay increase would strengthen this tendency.
Mr Steinkuhler may be overplaying his hand. But responsibility for the
impasse is evenly divided. West German unions played little part in agreeing
the east German wage timetable. This was largely the work of an ill-assorted
alliance of directors of east Germany's state-owned Kombinate, officials in
the Treuhand privatisation agency, and west German 'advisers' - many of whom
had a direct interest in putting east German competitors out of business.
Whatever the result, strike action would lead to unproductive bitterness.
This would depress prospects for a self-fuelling upturn east of the Elbe,
and deepen the psychological gulf dividing east from west. The Bonn
government must make every effort to bring about a compromise, before the
dispute ends up in a strike no-one can win.

<TEXT>
THE CONFEDERATION of British Industry yesterday produced a report on
education and training for 16 to 19-year-olds which is a welcome reminder
that, even in these ill-tempered times, sensible solutions to long-standing
problems can be proposed and have some chance of implementation.
Few people outside the educational/training cognoscenti are likely to read
the report, which is weighed down with the usual acronyms, but its message
is well known enough: the education system in Britain produces a small
number of highly educated people with no training or work experience, and a
rather larger number of people with training but little education. Business,
as the CBI says, needs people who are numerate, literate and have core
skills - the ability to communicate, to apply technology, work with others,
solve problems and respond to change. The fact that it is not getting them
in sufficient numbers is largely because of the Achilles' heel of education
and training provision for 16 to 19-year-olds.
The CBI has come up with some interesting ideas, not all of which are brand
new, but which together amount to a coherent strategy. The most radical is
the plan to extend the existing experiment with training credits to embrace
all training and education for 16 to 19-year-olds. The CBI proposes that
over the next few years young people should be using credits to buy their
academic sixth-form education and their technical training at a further
education college as well as a training place with an employer.
The idea will meet with stiff resistance from the educational establishment
but it has the potential to keep the educational providers on their toes and
motivate young people. Through putting pressure on non-training employers it
also goes some way to meet the critics of the voluntarist approach to
training. Above all, providing the same form of finance for the high-status
sixth-form, the low-status FE college and workplace training, it provides a
boost to parity of esteem.
A useful side-effect of a universal credit system would be to raise the
status of careers guidance officers, who would become crucial sources of
information on where to spend the credits. The CBI rightly says that
additional government investment is required in careers guidance and
recommends that every young person should have at least four hours of such
guidance.
The idea of a single framework of exams and qualifications stretching from
vocational NVQs to academic A-levels and a system of awards mixing the
academic and vocational called 'careership certificates' is more
problematic. The principle may be right, but it would threaten the existing
system with overload. The building blocks of the system - NVQs and GNVQs -
are both in their infancy, while the last official attempt to produce a
combined qualification, the Advanced Diploma, has not been a success.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Lacklustre in the lucky country: Australia's low-key
election campaign belies its importance to continued structural reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's 11.3m voters go to the polls on Saturday facing an uninspiring
choice between a Labor government that looks destined to lose and a
conservative opposition that has failed to show that it deserves to win.
Snug in their taxpayer-funded air force jets, the party leaders have spent
nearly five weeks criss-crossing the continent's great brown spaces,
frantically quarrying middle Australia for support. They might as well have
stayed at home. Voting is compulsory - on pain of prosecution - but all the
evidence is that, in Lord Whitelaw's famous phrase, the politicians have
been going around the country stirring up apathy.
Battered by slow economic growth and high unemployment, the electorate is
sullen and suspicious. It is hard to find anyone outside the party machines
who actively supports either Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, or Mr John
Hewson, leader of the opposition Liberal-National party coalition. Only
party officials believe Mr Keating's frequent claims that this is
Australia's most important election ever. To most people it is, as The Age
newspaper put it, merely the most important election since the last one.
Much of the cynicism reflects the impact of the worst recession in 60 years,
which has raised the total number of unemployed to more than 1m and raised
the unemployment rate to 11 per cent. Beggars have appeared in the streets
of Sydney and Melbourne - only a fraction of the numbers seen in London or
New York, but still a visible reminder that the lucky country can no longer
take the good life for granted.
The election ought to provide an opportunity for the opposition to take the
government to task over the recession. But it is failing to do so, because
the campaign has been hijacked by a government attack on one element of the
opposition's programme - the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST),
similar to European value-added tax.
Labor's strategy has diverted attention from the recession to an
interminable debate about the effect of the proposed GST on specific
consumer goods and industries. The best part of two days, for example, was
devoted to a row about the likely effects of the tax changes on the price of
cakes in bakers' shops. (The answer depends on the kind of cake and whether
the paper bag is included in the calculation.)
The irony is that Australians will be deciding a serious issue on polling
day, even if it is not being put to them openly. The question is simple: are
voters still committed to radical structural economic change, or do they
want a pause to catch their breath, as some Labor ministers have suggested?
In a normal election, Labor would be trumpeting its record as the most
successful reforming government in Australian history. Three times since
1983 Labor has won re-election by reminding the electorate that it was Mr
Keating and Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister, who began the job of
dismantling the web of protection and regulation which had isolated
Australia from the world economy for nearly 90 years.
Between 1983 and 1990, Labor floated the currency, deregulated the financial
system, reduced subsidies to industry and began the process of tariff
reduction. It has also partly decentralised the labour market by encouraging
a limited move from national wage negotiations to company-level bargaining,
started privatising government businesses, encouraged greater Asian
immigration, and switched the focus of trade and diplomatic efforts from
Europe to Asia.
But perhaps because this is not a normal election Labor's principal concern
has been to avoid discussing its record. The party fears attracting
attention to Mr Keating's mishandling of monetary policy between 1988 and
1991, which pushed the economy into recession.
On the few occasions when the prime minister has been cornered on the
economy, he has responded bluntly that Australia has emerged from the
recession with the developed world's lowest inflation rate, at 0.3 per cent,
and the strongest growth in gross domestic product - forecast by the
Treasury at 2.4 per cent for the current financial year. Only once has the
opposition come near to forcing him to admit that the Treasury's medium-term
growth forecasts would mean an increase in unemployment over the next three
years.
With the exception of sugar tariffs, which have been frozen to protect
growers in marginal east-coast seats, the government has resisted the
temptation to court popularity by reversing or relaxing the reforms which
have already been achieved. Mr Keating could probably win votes in Melbourne
and Adelaide by slowing the reduction of tariff protection for the
automotive and textile industries. He has not done so, in spite of losing a
Melbourne by-election last year to an independent candidate who espoused a
return to protectionism.
But the government has produced no plans for further reforms, leaving the
impression that it has exhausted its reforming zeal. A re-elected Labor
government would probably privatise the remaining government holdings in
banking and aviation, continue its pursuit of greater efficiency in service
industries such as transport and the docks, and tinker further with the
country's wage-bargaining system. But the campaign rhetoric suggests that
the emphasis would shift back to Labor's traditional concerns with social
justice and national identity, including Mr Keating's vague plans to remove
Queen Elizabeth as head of state.
Mr Hewson, by contrast, has gambled that the electorate is willing to accept
a further dose of radical reform, which the coalition has set out in detail
in its pugnaciously titled Fightback programme. Fightback is a free-market
plan which aims to cut public spending sharply and increase the role of
markets in almost every section of the economy. Tariff reform would be
speeded up, the centralised wage system would be abolished, and there would
be a move to greater reliance on private provision of social services such
as health and education. The GST would provide funds for significant cuts in
personal income taxes and the abolition of half a dozen indirect taxes,
including payroll tax and wholesale sales tax.
The Liberal-National coalition claims that the programme would cut business
costs, create 2m jobs by the end of the decade, and increase the savings
rate, which would help reduce Australia's high net foreign debt. Mr Hewson
has performed well during the campaign, surprising observers who expected
him to be crushed by the more aggressive and experienced prime minister. But
the coalition has found it hard to counter the government's attack on the
GST.
In his frequent appearances on radio talk shows, Mr Hewson tries in vain to
discuss unemployment, industrial relations or the beneficial impact of the
GST on exports. But callers want an answer to the same question: how will
the GST affect me? Often, the opposition leader is unable to answer.
The odds remain against Labor, which has been steadily losing ground since
1983, and would lose office on a swing to the conservatives of just 0.9 per
cent. That is less than the swing against the government in every election
since 1966.
Labor must also overcome a strong feeling that the time has arrived for a
change of federal government, following the recent defeat of Labor
administrations in three of the six states. But the GST debate has improved
the government's standing since the beginning of the campaign, when it
trailed the coalition by 6 to 12 percentage points in the opinion polls. The
latest polls, published earlier this week, put the conservatives only 5
points or less ahead.
The coalition is likely to get a boost today when official statistics are
expected to show that the unemployment rate rose again in February.
Nevertheless, it has lost the battle to explain its programme, and its
failure is likely to translate into lost votes.
Barring a surge to the conservatives in the last few days, the most likely
outcome is a narrow coalition majority. But the opposition's inability to
get its message across could yet hand Mr Keating Australia's biggest upset
victory since the war.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Personal View: How Lamont can square the circle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CEDRIC SANDFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
To tax or not to tax - that, according to most economic commentators, is the
dilemma facing Britain's chancellor of the exchequer in his Budget. To tax
would risk strangling an incipient recovery. Yet Norman Lamont must tax soon
or the deficit will get out of hand. The most widely held view is that he
should not tax in March, but should in December. This choice has been
presented too starkly. The danger of inhibiting recovery arises from
reducing effective demand for goods and services. But there are two ways of
increasing taxation, overall, which could reduce the deficit without
reducing demand.
One is by changing the tax mix. If the chancellor increased taxation on the
savers and reduced it on the spenders, he could take rather more from the
savers than he gave back to the spenders without reducing aggregate demand.
To take an oversimplified example: if there were two groups of taxpayers of
equal size, one of which saved half of any additions to their income while
the other saved none, the chancellor could raise twice as much in extra
taxes from the former as he returned to the latter in reduced taxes, without
diminishing aggregate demand.
In general, the lower income groups save very little of any additions to
income while the highest income groups save more. A change in the balance of
taxation, taking more from the rich and less from the poor, would enable the
chancellor to contribute to deficit reduction without harming recovery.
There are many ways in which this could be achieved which could be
calculated with some precision from the Treasury's economic model.
Thus, for example, the reduction in demand arising from an additional top
rate of income tax of 45 or 50 per cent on, say, taxable incomes above
Pounds 40,000, could be matched by an increase in the income tax threshold
or an extension of the 20 per cent band. More acceptable to the
Conservatives' low tax philosophy (which has really meant low income tax
philosophy) would be to raise the upper limit for employees' National
Insurance contributions and offset the demand effect by raising the lower
limit.
Of course, the increase in demand could come from additional public
spending. It would cost about Pounds 1bn a year to give an extra Pounds 20 a
week to those unemployed for more than a year - either directly (to show
that the community still cared) or subject to some 'workfare' conditions.
Payment to the long-term unemployed would rarely be saved and more than
Pounds 1bn could be taken from higher rate taxpayers, without reducing
demand.
The other way of reducing the deficit, by taxing without cutting demand, is
to increase inheritance tax. Property owners rarely feel it necessary to
save against future death duties, while inheritors only have regard to the
post-tax inheritance. The state can insert a bigger tax wedge between what
is left at death and what the beneficiaries receive without reducing demand.
A new rate of death duty - say, 50 per cent on estates of more than Pounds
500,000 - could be added to the present 40 per cent rate.
Any fear that adverse effects on agriculture or the private business might
inhibit recovery have been removed by the reliefs of successive Conservative
chancellors. The contribution to deficit reduction by an increase in
inheritance tax would be small, but a useful start. Moreover, because of the
much increased opportunities for accumulation by the wealthy which have been
provided by the Conservatives, an inheritance tax increase should prove an
expanding source of revenue, especially if the easier avoidance loopholes
were blocked.
Many people would see these measures as desirable in their own right. One of
the least attractive features of the Thatcher years has been the enormous
increase in income inequalities (see table). Changing the tax mix would be a
modest offset. Moreover, if the higher tax were seen as a specific measure
to help the long-term unemployed, even some of the payers might not be too
displeased.
As for death duties, it has always been inconsistent that the party which
stressed the enterprise culture and pay-related performance should favour
low death duties. The characteristic of inheritance is that the
beneficiaries' receipts are unrelated to any contribution (with the possible
exception of spouses, who are exempt anyway). Perhaps the need to curb the
deficit could even promote a little more consistency in the Conservative
philosophy]

FT  11 MAR 93 / Letter: Only long-term planning will halt downward cycle in
UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID HOWELL MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lord Howe's Budget remedies - cut spending, raise taxes - make sense as
far as they go (Personal View, March 9). But they would be more bearable if
they included one vital longer-term ingredient which successive chancellors
have tended to overlook.
I refer to the imperative need to raise levels of investment in the
infrastructure of the country. The failure to prepare Britain's towns, urban
areas, roads, railways and public facilities generally for the 21st century
(or even for the 20th), in increasing contrast not just to the UK's European
neighbours but more strikingly to the modern cities of Asia, is much nearer
the root of the problem than economic policy-makers here realise.
It explains why Britain overheats so quickly, why stops have to be more
violent. and why after each phase in the cycle the UK drifts further behind,
with lower revenue growth, and therefore more spending cuts, and so on down
the plughole.
Long ago we should not only have swept away the remaining obstacles to
private investment in public services but should also have established a
separate capital budget (as in Japan, for example) which could be protected
and even expanded while current spending economics are rightly pursued.
Please could chancellors and the Treasury look beyond one year ahead.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Letter: Clear need for UK government to provide export
credits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ALICK GOLDSMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your editorial, 'The pleas for manufacturing' (March 8), you take a
side-swipe against export credit guarantees, on the grounds that they 'help
companies do business in countries where there is little security of
payment'. Really? Among the top 10 markets backed by Export Credits
Guarantee Department last year were Malaysia, China, South Africa, Australia
and Dubai. Which of these do you view as having 'little security of
payment'?
The need for government backing for export credits is primarily a matter of
time-scale. A typical construction project overseas can take five years or
more to complete. Over that period, however secure and stable the country
concerned, there will always be a risk of some unforeseen political,
financial or natural upheaval frustrating the smooth development of the
project. Government agencies can afford to take - indeed many would say they
have a duty to take - a longer view than any private company or financial
institution. This is why all major exporting countries have found it
necessary to establish export credit agencies to shield their exporters from
at least some of the unfore-seeable risks. Among such agencies, ECGD has for
most of its long life been extremely successful, both in its primary task of
encouraging the export of British goods and services, and, until recently,
earning substantial profits for the exchequer. It returned to profit in
1991-92.
In recent years, ECGD has been forced by government to put the cart of
prudence before the horse of export promotion. Despite some welcome steps
last year to redress the balance, recent surveys continue to show that, in a
number of vital markets, ECGD cover remains more expensive and harder to
obtain than that provided by the equivalent agencies of our competitors on
the continent and overseas.
Additional ECGD cover for crucial markets, a competitive premium, would be a
vital catalyst for further growth in project and other exports, to the
immediate benefit of the British economy, and at no immediate cost to the
exchequer. There might be a real cost at some point in the future; but any
additional contingent liability would represent the sort of risks which
other governments find acceptable in terms of their industrial goals.

THE FATE OF HONG KONG By Gerald Segal Simon &amp; Schuster, Pounds 16.99 234
pages
Hong Kong will be returned to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June 30
1997. However, that is virtually the only thing that we know with certainty
about its future.
As Gerald Segal points out, the transfer is one fixed point set upon an
ever-changing canvas of wider events which will both affect and be
influenced by the fate of Hong Kong.
The three main players in the drama naturally tend to view it from their own
perspectives. China's priorities have been to recover the territory first,
and to ensure mutual prosperity second. Britain, having decided that it had
no option but to give up Hong Kong, has been concerned to withdraw with as
much dignity as is possible when handing over 6m flourishing capitalists to
a ruthless communist regime. Hong Kong's people have had to decide how best
to position themselves for their own prosperity and security.
The value of Segal's book is that it stands back from these rather narrow
and emotionally charged approaches and examines Hong Kong dispassionately as
an international issue. Segal, a Canadian-born academic who is senior fellow
at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, attempts to
look into Hong Kong's future beyond 1997 by reference to a range of external
factors. By far the most important is the course of political and economic
development within China. Segal postulates various possible outcomes, from
mass exodus to smooth convergence with China.
To focus on outside factors affecting Hong Kong is, by implication, to
accept the premise adopted by negotiators in Beijing and London - at least
until the recent more determined attitude taken by Mr Chris Patten, Hong
Kong's governor - that Hong Kong's people themselves have little say. Segal
comments, however, that they have shown little initiative over their own
fate. Those that have, have chosen to leave. A low turnout in the 1991
Legislative Council elections made it hard to argue that they were
struggling to avoid Chinese rule.
The current battle over modest democratic reforms proposed by Mr Patten is
important in this context in that the governor has challenged Hong Kong's
people to stand up for themselves. If, out of deference to the future
sovereign or simply out of apathy, they do not support an increase in
representation, there would be little willingness in Britain to pursue the
argument.
The fate of Hong Kong, especially if it is unhappy, could touch many
countries. Since it will be a very high-profile part of China, it will
affect China's international relations, for example with the US. It could
create pressure for mass immigration of Hong Kong people around the world.
Attempting to assess the role of the other countries in Hong Kong's future,
Segal gets bogged down in examination of emigration trends. But there is no
denying that emigration has already sapped Hong Kong's dynamism. Canada's
aggressive immigration policy underlines the fact that Hong Kong people are
viewed by some countries (not Britain) as an asset for which to compete,
possibly to Hong Kong's detriment.
Hong Kong itself is likely to be an influence on the rapidly changing
country which it is joining. Segal's analysis of how it will fit into China
is the most interesting part of the book. China's growth, particularly in
the areas around Hong Kong, is creating shifts in relations between Beijing
and the provinces. Hong Kong's economy has become increasingly
interdependent with that of neighbouring Guangdong province, and
particularly the prosperous Shenzhen special economic zone across the
border. If economic development is accompanied by decentralisation of
political power, it is possible that the Hong Kong tail will wag the
Guangdong dog. Under this rosy scenario, Beijing's pragmatism would allow
1997 to pass unnoticed, and Hong Kong would then lead a newly
industrialising south China economic zone.
Such optimism could be supported by China's pragmatic 'one country, two
systems' concept, its blurring of the geographical boundary by developing
the areas around Hong Kong, and its increasing investment in Hong Kong and
use of it as a financial and trade entrepot.
Segal, however, expects a more prosaic fate: not collapse, but 'a loud
grinding of gears as the cog of Hong Kong fits into the larger China'. He
suggests that Hong Kong's dynamism will slow, to the pace of an albeit
accelerating China, partly because of the already high rates of emigration
among skilled professionals. He judges that China's rulers, while wanting
Hong Kong to be prosperous, are more concerned about a smooth political
absorption and would therefore accept less economic dynamism in Hong Kong if
that was the necessary price.
This outcome could take many forms: Hong Kong could still lead a new growth
zone, or it could gradually wither. Beijing's policies, and its relations
with its provinces and with other countries, will certainly be the most
important factors determining whether or not the necessary conditions exist
for Hong Kong to prosper.
However, Hong Kong is above all a centre for business. It is business people
who will have to make individual judgments about those policies and their
effects. Their decisions will determine Hong Kong's new role and the pace at
which it develops. Segal is a specialist in international affairs and
examines Hong Kong from that perspective. Analysis of what is likely to
influence both Chinese and western businessmen in making those decisions is
also necessary in order to guess the fate of Hong Kong.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PATRICK BROOKS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, American Ambassador Raymond Seitz told Christian Tyler (Private View,
March 6) that he made two resolutions when posted to the Court of St James;
never to use the phrase 'special relationship' and never to quote Winston
Churchill. Both are laudable objectives and it would be pleasant to think
that this might signal a fresh departure for the English language, with
public figures all undertaking to forsake certain tired and dreary cliches
for more innovative expressions and other means of getting their messages
across.
However, in the course of the interview Ambassador Seitz, commenting on the
current mood of doom and gloom in the UK, remarked: 'There is a black dog
that wanders around Britain worrying about its future. . .' Black dog? Not
related to the famous 'Black Dog' that used to haunt the aforementioned
Winston Churchill in his fits of depression by any chance?

Sir, Regarding Observer's story, 'Lady in waiting' (February 22), I would
recommend that you contact the Garrick Club to ascertain its rules and
regulations on the matter. If you had done so, you would not have suggested
someone having a 'quiet word' with the Venezuelan ambassador as there was no
possibility of a 'diplomatic incident'. Ambassador Arcaya has organised
numerous luncheons at the Garrick at which ladies were present, and is very
much looking forward to meeting Ann Coffey, the new Labour MP for Stockport.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Economic Viewpoint: The battle for the 'franc fort'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Sunday March 21, five days after the British Budget, comes the first
round of the French parliamentary elections, to be followed by a second
round the following Sunday. They are much more important for the economies
of western European countries, including the UK, than anything the
chancellor announces on Tuesday. For they are likely to decide, at least for
the time being, the fate of both the European exchange rate mechanism and
the more ambitious project for European monetary union. By comparison, the
manoeuvrings among British MPs over Maastricht tactics are children's games.
Just as the Franco-German relationship is at the heart of EC politics, it is
also at the heart of EC monetary relations, symbolised by the policy of the
franc fort. This denotes the French government's determination to stay in
the ERM and not to depreciate the franc against the D-Mark. The words are
also a pun on the name of the city of Frankfurt where the Bundesbank is
situated.
If the franc fort policy survives, the nucleus will be there of a future
European union, monetary and perhaps political. On the other hand, take away
France from the present ERM and one is left basically with a German bloc,
which will no longer be able to justify the label European. (Iberia is
hardly likely to remain inside in such circumstances.)
The conservative opposition in France, which is a strong favourite to win
the elections, is also committed to the franc fort. But, obviously, the
prospect of a new cabinet creates extra uncertainty. The foreign exchange
markets will follow closely not only the elections, but even more the
subsequent negotiations to select a right-wing prime minister with whom
President Francois Mitterrand can cohabit, and the new government's
programme.
There are many things going for the franc which sterling did not have at the
time of Black Wednesday, above all the enthusiastic support of the
Bundesbank. While the German central bank never disguised its view that
sterling was overvalued, it is fully committed to the franc/D-Mark rate.
Indeed, judged by most of the so-called fundamentals, the franc should be in
a stronger position than the D-Mark. French inflation is, at 2.1 per cent,
half the German rate. Manufacturing unit labour costs in francs are 10 per
cent below the 1987 level. The French budget deficit is lower than the
German, and the French current account is almost in balance.
Moreover, neither the German government nor the Bundesbank - in contrast to
the position a couple of years ago - has any interest in a further
appreciation of the D-Mark as an anti-inflationary measure. On the contrary,
the German authorities wish to avoid adding to existing recessionary
pressures in the export sector.
The weakness of the ERM defences in 1992 was that speculators had fixed
dates at which to aim - namely the Danish and French referendums. As these
dates drew near, it would have been worth moving out of suspect currencies,
even if there had been only a small chance of a devaluation. For the bet was
essentially one way. On this occasion, there is not so much one fixed day as
a danger period, from about now to the first policy statements of the next
French government.
The main thing going for the French franc is not the technical defences, but
underlying sentiment. Even market participants who expect a franc
depreciation do not anticipate one of more than about 5 per cent, and do not
want to be caught out by a subsequent appreciation or recovery of a floating
franc. Taking a position against the French currency is thus a trickier
proposition than one against sterling, the lira, or the peseta, last autumn.
Nevertheless many English-language market analysts still predict French
devaluation and are ideologically hostile to the franc fort.
The one development that could sink the franc fort would be a loss of faith
in it by the French policymaking elite. Until recently the main intellectual
opposition to the franc fort policy was - as most such movements are in most
countries - an unwillingness to face the costs of getting down inflation.
More recent critics have been more difficult to dismiss along these lines.
For France is undoubtedly experiencing a serious business slowdown, with
industrial production some 3 per cent below the level of a year ago, and
unemployment - on a comparable basis - edging up towards British rates. The
problem is not that of French competitiveness. The appreciation of the franc
against non D-Mark currencies since last September just about offsets a
similar improvement in French competitiveness over the previous four years
due to falling domestic costs.
Alain Madelin, the rather engaging French UDF (centre-right) politician, who
broke ranks with his colleagues to embrace a floating franc, quite sensibly
bases his case mainly on interest rates. It is worth giving him a hearing
rather than trying to quash him with an irritable wave of the hand, as most
French establishment figures do.
There is a twofold problem. Even if nominal rates were the same as in
Germany, real rates would be much higher thanks to France's very success in
overcoming inflation. Second, French market rates now need a 3 percentage
point premium over German rates because of the election uncertainties.
The French establishment has a reply of sorts. The prime rate, which forms
the basis of lending to domestic business, has been held down to 10 per
cent, partly as a result of government pressure, and partly because the
Banque de France undertakes some lending to the banks at below the official
repurchase rate. A more important point is that the greater part of lending
both to business and homebuyers, in both France and Germany, is on a medium
or long-term basis.
The heretics can say that there is a limit to how long French banks can
subsidise business, that short-term rates do matter even if less than in
Britain, and that real long-term rates of more than 5 per cent are too high
for a period of severe recession.
The policy of the orthodox French right is to reduce the cost of the franc
fort policy by moves to boost credibility, such as early independence for
the Banque de France and a fast-track approach to monetary union by the
inner core. The latter idea would, however, come up against the Bundesbank,
which is determined to go no faster than the Maastricht timetable, if only
on the grounds that Germany itself will not be ready any earlier for
monetary union. The Bundesbank is not directly responsible for exchange rate
policy, but is likely to be more effective on European monetary union than
it was on German monetary unification.
The paradox is that, if the franc fort policy had already achieved full
credibility, it would no longer be needed. France would set interest rates
no higher than necessary for domestic price stability and would replace
Germany as the anchor country of the ERM. Unfortunately its record of
stability does not yet extend long enough to do that. An experiment with
slightly lower interest rates than Germany's in 1991 proved very
short-lived.
In the end the speed with which, and extent to which, German interest rates
come down will be the major influence on the cost of the franc fort and the
likelihood of a new French government sticking to it. The Anglo-American
analysts fail to see that the franc fort policy represents a political and
economic achievement which it is worth fighting to preserve.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Letter: UK position on quality standards is complex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D C MACVICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on quality system certification is nicely provocative
('Need a quality certificate? Ask Tom, Dick or Harry', March 8).
It might have added in all seriousness that the position in the UK is more
complex than in some other nations and is fundamentally affected by the past
decisions of the UK government that system certification should be voluntary
and that there should be a competitive mechanism for bodies offering system
certification.
In my view Paul Hewlett is quite justified in expressing confidence in
professional buyers and in their knowledge of national accreditation. The
irony is the British Standards Institution's 'concern at the loophole', for
it is my understanding that BSI-QA has itself issued by far the most
'unaccredited' BS5750 registrations]
In the UK, everyone should look for the National Accreditation Council for
Certification Bodies' 'tick and crown', but recognise that the BS5750
standards, the EN29000 series in Europe, and the ISO9000 series
internationally, are the same. D C MacVicker,

FT  11 MAR 93 / Arts: A trip through the centuries - Cinema
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ORLANDO (PG) Sally Potter
SCENT OF A WOMAN (15) Martin Brest
A SONG FOR BEKO Nizamettin Aric
KNIFE IN THE WATER (18) Roman Polanski
Fleeing through the centuries, Virginia Woolf's Orlando was a boy-girl on
the run from sexual predestination. Changing gender as she careened through
400 years of English history, 'he' became 'she': partly in chameleon
response to a new Enlightenment, partly for the intuitive hell (or heaven)
of it. Meanwhile the novel's camera-shutter changes of place and time - each
time it went dark we next woke up to a new snapshot image of England in the
1600s, 1700s, 1800s - fixed the book's style somewhere in the prehistory of
cinema. Time-tripping a la Muybridge or Daguerre or Julia Margaret Cameron.
Sally Potter's film of Orlando keeps the flickery serenity of the original.
The changing tableaux, like animated lantern slides, shuttle us through the
changing eras: Tudor London (Quentin Crisp as Queen Bess), Augustan tea
parties (Ned Sherrin as Dr Johnson), Victorian romance (Billy Zane as a
Byronic heart-throb, plus billowing shirt and black locks) to a 20th century
of world war, pregnancy, free love and dawning feminism.
The final scene, which could have been daft, instead defines and seals the
film's style. Tilda Swinton's Orlando sprawls Alice-like under a tree (the
image makes a bookend with the matching opening), while sung to by a
fuzzy-coloured pop-video angel dangling in the sky. At the same time
something about female liberation is intoned by a voice-over: 'She's no
longer trapped by destiny . . .' It sounds winsome and preachy. Instead it
is light, lithe and deliciously self-ironising.
We speak as one who dreaded this film. To hand Orlando the book to a
writer-director like Sally Potter, best-known previously for feminist
torture sessions like The Gold Diggers (Julie Christie going gnomic in the
Yukon), might have been like handing a gun or club to a psychopath. But
instead of shielding our heads, we are soon making Macaulay Culkin
palms-to-cheeks gestures of wonder.
We are in visual heaven as soon as the jewelled 17th century scenes begin
skating by. The Greenawayesque precision in sets and costumes - from G's own
design team, Ben Van Os and Jan Roelfs - is married to a brave freedom in
dramatic styles. Quentin Crisp camps it up with the queenly advice: 'Do not
fade, do not wither, do not grow old' (the story's self-fulfilling
injunction). Swinton flings verbal asides and mini-monologues boldly at the
camera. And everyone talks, eats and dances on skates, inventing the
tracking shot 400 years before it was invented.
Though each ensuing time-hop makes its social, cultural or gender-political
point, from the male chauvinist clubbiness of the Augustan salons to the
vaporous romanticism of Victorian times, nothing is laboured. Potter's
hurry-on-by direction and Swinton's sphinx-like ethereality as a presence -
nothing so crude as 'acting' ever seems to take place within this actress -
mean we segue into the next historical encounter before the ink is dry on
the last one. And pedagoguery is kept at bay not by avoidance but by a
mocking Brechtianism. The film's chapter headings - 'Death', 'Love',
'Politics', 'History' - use a small inoculating dose of schoolroom chalk to
ensure we never catch the full-blown didacticism.
Ironically, the only danger the film almost does fall prey to is a sense of
inconsequentiality. Okay, so we have sped through four centuries of
sexual-political evolution. But where exactly are we now? Womanhood, on the
cusp of a new millennium, may be happy and fulfilled and quired to by MTV
angels. Then again some women might not see it that way. Perhaps Orlando 2
should be made, giving us a sci-fem sashay into the future, where the icons
of machismo still hold out and the A. Schwarzeneggers of this world wait for
a final showdown with the T. Swintons. The novel's original author might not
approve. But then who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?
Miss Woolf, given half a chance, would eat Scent Of A Woman alive. Male
bonding and male values are the entire known universe in this tale of a
grouchy, blind, retired Colonel played by Al Pacino. Colonel Al needs and
gets a seeing-eye minder, schoolboy Chris O'Donnell, for a last weekend on
the town (New York) after which he plans to - Tss] Tss] Mustn't give away
the ending.
But will you still be there for it? It comes two hours 40 minutes after the
beginning. This is a dramatic span so epic that we wait for some epic events
to fill it. But no. Colonel Al keeps barking out sour wisdom to young Chris.
Young Chris keeps hoping Colonel Al will get him out of the moral jam he's
in back at school. (The head teacher might help him to a Harvard place if he
sneaks on a mischief-maker). And the ghost of Virginia Woolf keeps rattling
her chains saying, 'Aren't there any women in this film, except the ones
Pacino either wants to lay or to wish on the virginal youngster?'
This overextended buddiness binge was scripted by William Goldman and
directed Martin Brest, a specialist in male-bonding comedies (Beverly Hills
Cop, Midnight Run). Inspired by a 20-year-old Italian movie called Profumo
Di Donna (unacknowledged in the credits), it is up for a lot of Oscars. That
should surprise no one. The thinking at Oscar nomination time goes like
this. Give us a film in which disability, dying, teenage bewilderment and
surrogate parenthood are all mixed together in a bitter-sweet Learning
Experience and we will give the pseudo-humanist twaddle a shot at the
statuette.
The only true deserver is Mr Pacino. He plays Colonel Grouchy-But-Softy to
the hilt. Indeed the hilt might be sticking out of him. Early on Mr P's
performance is all staccato, cunningly modulated rasps, as of a man saving
his energy for better, more painless times. Then, as in The Godfather, the
Pacino economy pays brilliant dividends when the 'fff' markings come along.
The roars are unstopped, and the Colonel's trademark 'Hahs]' or 'Hoo-hahs]'
become claps of derisive thunder from heaven.
In the last reel the old soldier's life-or-death confrontation with the
youngster, across a loaded revolver, has Pacino eating up the air around
him, plus the furniture, plus Master O'Donnell. Given this actorly
phenomenon in its midst, Hollywood should surely fashion something worthy
for him. How about King Lear? No, perhaps not. They would probably call it
Scent Of A Monarch, add in a subplot about a surrogate son and then lay the
overlong heartwarmer before the Oscar committee.
Nizamettin Aric's A Song For Beko is the first Kurdish-language feature
film. Critical perspective buckles somewhat under the weight of this
geo-historical fact. We can say that this tale of a Turkish Kurd forced into
a border-hopping odyssey of flight by war and political oppression  - the
Iran-Iraq conflict, Saddam Hussein's gas-assisted attempts at ethnic
cleansing - is stiffly acted (except by Aric himself in the lead) and
plainly directed.
But the film's mere existence is a feat. Though Aric funded it from Germany,
where he himself fled in 1984, it makes few attempts (orphans apart) to
provide ready-access drama for an international audience. The plains
forbiddingly howl, and only the subtitles mediate between you and the
soundtrack's strange guttural noises. Once in a while, though, a scene
invokes the universal language of despair - a landscape of slaughtered
villagers, a poison-gas bombardment from the air - to erase all distance
between spectator and spectacle.
Knife In The Water is the early testament of another man now condemned to
pace the wilderness. Roman Polanski, ex-Polish, ex-Hollywood nomad, made
this three-folks-and-a-boat black comedy back in 1962. Its queasy
sex-triangle wit is unsurpassed. What better setting for a film about the
destabilising swell of tension and jealousy than the ditto swell of a large,
windswept lake? Though the spoken language is Polish, the body language,
facial semaphore and prickly telegraphic silences are universal.

Are crabs turning into land animals? Wildlife On One (8.00 BBC1) considers
how so many of these creatures in the last 35m years - scarcely more than a

FT  11 MAR 93 / Arts: 'The Women of Trachis' and 'The Frogs' - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fifth century Athens arrives at the Oxford Playhouse with Sophocles'
Trachiniai in Greek and Aristophanes' Frogs in English. The Oxford
University Drama Society production deftly puts these round plays into a
square theatre: both plays benefit, and both illuminate the Greek stage.
The Trachiniai (c. 450BC) tells of Herakles' death: he puts on a robe
inadvertently drenched in poison by his wife Deianira, and dies horribly
after she kills herself in remorse.
The director Alex Walker, with University advisers David Raeburn and Oliver
Taplin have compromised between Athenian simplicity and contemporary
convenience. The production shows how significant action is recoverable from
the words of the plays. There are no masks, and the gestures are
naturalistic rather than formulaic, but the foreignness keeps chorus and
actors separate and separated.
Non-Greek speakers have to rely on the chorus, sensing the modulation of
their voices and tracing their interaction with the major characters. The
choric episodes use a variety of music, rhythmic verse-speaking. So exits,
entrances, actions, gestures, objects, tokens, silences and sequences become
more important when the language itself is occluded.
The actors - in particular Alice de Smith (Deianira), Robert Lloyd-Parry
(Herakles) and Sara Kalim (Chorus leader) - speak with easy fluency, making
the emotion of each interchange live in their speech and movement.
After the enervating sight of Herakles screaming from his funeral pyre on
Mount Oeta, the evening offers Aristophanes' Frogs (405BC). While Sophocles
is structured and abstract, Aristophanes is chaotic and tangible. He brings
out the worst in others. Swift was caught with the howler 'Aristophanes . .
. Too bawdy and profane is'; and the Frog chorus sent 19th-century Hellenic
scholarship in search of authentic 'Brekekekex ko-ax ko-ax' frog calls in
the inland waters of Greece.
Here, Frogs has been boldly modernised, keeping to the spirit of
Aristophanes' scatological, political and literary humour. The god of
theatre, Dionysus, despairs of 'new writing' and heads to Hades for more of
the old. The action centres on a debate in hell between Aeschylus and
Euripides ('How dare you put me in a proscenium arch'), the first a fruity
Thespian and the second a thin deconstruction worker.
The surrounding chorus comprises journalists, the principals are
politicians, and the boring boatman to hell - who takes Deutschmarks only -
a good stab at John Major. Out in the Styx means rap singing, Camillagate
sound-bites and a quorum of transvestite judiciary. But the denizens of hell
do dance the salsa, a fact which Virgil and Dante have concealed long
enough.
Oxford Playhouse until March 13

FT  11 MAR 93 / Arts: The Arditti's Schoenberg - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Arditti Quartet launched its cycle of the Schoenberg quartets on Monday
to a comfortably filled Purcell Room. There are four concerts in all, each
made into an attractive package with the quartets of Berg and Webern, and a
token representation by Zemlinsky, placed alongside Schoenberg''s four (the
posthumously published D major quartet from 1897 is not included), together
with Verklarte Nacht and the String Trio.
The opening brought the first official Schoenberg, his Op. 7; it was
prefaced by Berg's Lyric Suite and Webern's Five Pieces Op. 5. All are works
the Arditti play with easy familiarity and the efficiency they bring to so
much of the 20th-century's quartet literature. The technical difficulties of
the Berg cause no problems and the thematic tangles of Schoenberg's
sprawling structure are negotiated without hesitation; it is note-perfect
playing with not a marking misplaced.
There was not, though, much sense of occasion in their performances, more a
take-it-or-leave-it attitude which often worked against the grain of music
that demands a finely judged appreciation of idiom and intensity as much as
technical skill and perfect co-ordination. The Webern pieces need room to
breathe, and a massive concentration of physical and mental resources; here
they were reeled off almost automatically, as if they were thin little
sketches rather than fiercely compressed miniatures.
Everything had been squeezed into a narrow band of dynamics between piano
and forte; there were few extremes, so that both the vertiginous excesses of
the Lyric Suite (if ever a work demanded that its interpreters delve beneath
the surface it is this) and the romantic effusions of Schoenberg 1, the big
tunes and the bracing counterpoint, had very little expressive power. The
perfectly contained Arditti approach with its careful analytical sound may
be one of contemporary music's most precious assets but for the classical
texts of the Second Viennese School something richer and more searching is
now required.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Technology: On the fast track / A look at the Briway rapid
transit system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At first sight, it looks like just the sort of eccentricity for which the
English are renowned. How else to explain the presence of an urban rapid
transit system running through the grounds of a 2,000-acre private estate in
leafy Surrey?
Yet this rich man's train set is not just a folie de grandeur. It is a
serious attempt by Alan Bristow, the former helicopter king, to take on the
giants of the world railway equipment industry with a British light rapid
transit system.
The rumbustious Bristow, 69, made millions out of serving the world's
offshore oil and gas industries with his helicopter business. Now retired,
he has sunk Pounds 9.6m of his personal fortune over the last five years
into what he calls the Briway transit system.
Aided by a 28-strong team of specialist engineers, he has designed and built
an 860m-long system on his estate and runs it 20 hours a day under test. Now
all that remains is to convince someone to put it into commercial use.
Bristow says he was led into the idea in 1987 by the rise in interest in
modern-day trams during the 1980s and by his belief that other systems were
expensive, unattractive and based on outdated technology.
The Briway system differs from others in running not on rails, but on a flat
track using quieter pneumatic tyres. It is guided by horizontally-mounted
rubber-tyred wheels which run against the inside faces of guide rails on
each side of the track, while power is collected through contact shoes
running against conductor rails underneath the rails.
The presence of the guide rails means the system is best suited to cases
where it is segregated from other traffic - for example, airport terminal
shuttles. But Bristow has also developed a street-running variant guided by
a slot set into the roadway and powered by overhead contact wires.
Bristow says two key features distinguish the Briway system from those of
other manufacturers. It is based on existing mass-produced components from
the automotive and rail industries which can be bought cheaply off the
shelf, and Bristow has applied aerospace industry techniques of testing each
part of the system through millions of cycles on his Surrey estate rather
than expecting passengers to act as guinea pigs.
He also believes he can beat anyone on price. 'By using a whole bunch of
proven components and putting them together in a unique way, our price
performance is superior to what people have become accustomed to paying
through the nose for.'
Sensitive to suggestions that his entry into the rapid transit industry
might lack credibility until he finds a customer, Bristow points to the fact
that Briway had been the preferred system for a proposed 2 3/4 -mile transit
in Southampton until the project was scuppered two years ago by the city
council's failure to win the necessary legislation.
Undeterred by that setback, he says he is now tendering for five contracts
worldwide - three of them airport shuttle schemes (two in the Far East and
one in Europe) and two urban projects (one in the Netherlands and one in
Denmark). Together, the projects are worth Pounds 150m, he says. Beyond
that, a world market for transit systems worth Pounds 2bn beckons over the
next four years.
'Of that, nearly half, or Pounds 960m to be precise, is ideally suited to
Briway,' Bristow says - enough to turn a toy into a serious proposition.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Technology: Schools advise on IT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DELLA BRADSHAW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Portable computers are the latest toy of many a chief executive. By May this
year, they could also be the latest toy of the schoolchild.
The Department of Education has allocated Pounds 2.55m for schools in
England to discover for themselves the benefits of computing on the move.
'It is the largest scheme for IT in Europe,' says Fred Daly, technical
director of the National Council for Educational Technology, which is in
charge of the project.
Daly believes the scheme could be the start of something big. He points to
the US where students starting university are advised by their colleges on
which computer to buy so that they can plug into the main computer network
and make use of shared college facilities such as laser printers and CD
libraries.
'We're just getting evidence that parents in the UK are now buying machines
for their children,' says Daly.
Schools - both primary and secondary - are being asked to submit proposals
for exploiting the equipment, which falls into four categories.
Portable computers with all the power of desk-top machines, many with
Windows software, would cost about Pounds 1,000 each. With probes or sensors
attached the machines could be used for gathering information. And by
attaching an electronic tape measure students would be able to use the
laptop for measurements outside the classroom.
Palm-top machines, costing around Pounds 300 each. Some would be basic
organisers, others would have all the functions of full-blown PCs, but with
a smaller keyboard. 'They're very suitable indeed for small fingers,' says
Daly.
Low-cost wordprocessors (Pounds 150 each) which display up to eight lines of
text. These would be used for a range of writing activities in the
classroom.
Graphical calculators, costing Pounds 30-Pounds 40 which could be used in
science or maths, for example, for drawing graphs.
Daly is confident that the portability of the machines will not encourage
students to remove them permanently. In small-scale trials, he says, theft
was not a problem.
'If teachers and children get good-quality equipment then they respond,'
says Daly.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Poland opts for TV
ads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hortex, Poland's largest fruit and vegetable processing group, is setting an
example for other eastern European companies adapting to the rigours of a
market economy.
The company recently decided to spend money on advertising, marketing and
distribution. 'We noticed that our fruit juices were no longer being sold
from under the counter but standing on shop shelves,' says Wojciech Zelazny,
a deputy president. 'So we decided to advertise.'
Last month the first tailored TV advertisments were aired in a 5bn zloty
campaign run by BBDO Warsaw - the first step of its kind by a Polish
company, according to Dorota Walczyk, Warsaw chief of BBDO, the advertising
and marketing agency.
Hortex, which recorded sales worth 3,500bn zloty (Pounds 145.3m) last year,
plans to spend 50bn zloty on distribution this year.
Walczyk praises her client. 'There were no differences of opinion and they
were willing to learn.' She may have been lucky as Brian Dunnion who heads
Saatchi and Saatchi in Warsaw says Polish companies have 'a producer
mentality'.
'They still haven't thought out who they are producing for,' he says, noting
this as the main problem in dealing with Polish clients. Last year his
company's Dollars 15m (Pounds 10.4m) turnover in Poland came mostly from
western multinational clients, but Dunnion is looking for local firms to
work for. 'This is where the growth is will come from.'
For Walczyk speed is essential because costs - such as the price of air time
 -and competition are increasing.
The Hortex campaign is aimed at consumers and places less emphasis on work
with retailers and wholesalers. But the wholesaler culture which has grown
in Poland in the past three years decrees only goods advertised on TV move
in large quantities. If the wholesalers and retailers see the juices on TV
they will believe it will sell and will take larger orders, says Walczyk.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The scent of things
to come - Commercial interest in the use of aromas is growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The idea that different smells produce different behavioural moods is hardly
new. But the commercial application of aromatics, or Musak of the Nose as
some marketeers have dubbed it, looks to be growing.
Fragrance strips in magazines are already familiar - December's edition of
Vanity Fair had five of them. But other examples - some quite bizarre - are
increasingly found.
A Seattle bank, for instance, is planning to scent the money in its
automated teller machines. A Marriott hotel in Miami has installed a Dollars
12,000 (Pounds 8,333) machine that releases floral and citrus 'natural plant
abstracts' into the atmosphere in its lobby (apparently to reduce stress in
its guests). While several Japanese companies use aromas introduced via
their air conditioners to improve staff motivation and raise productivity.
Mitsubishi's researchers have projected that office demand for smells could
reach Y10bn (Pounds 59m) by the year 2000.
Not everyone approves of olfactory marketing, especially when it is employed
to woo shoppers. US consumer groups have criticised the growing use of
fragrances by retailers, accusing them of subliminal advertising.
Apologists say there is nothing sinister, that the nice pongs can be
compared with background music, fancy lighting or plush carpeting.
Recent commercial interest - including the establishment last year in London
of a specialist consultancy Marketing Aromatics - can be linked to the
results of an expanding body of research into human behaviour. A US study
researched the effect of odours on product perception by getting individuals
to examine Nike sneakers in two rooms: one fitted with purified air, the
other scented with a floral smell. Eighty four per cent of participants said
they were more likely to buy the shoes, or liked the shoes more, in the
scented room and many said they would pay Dollars 10 more for them in that
environment.
In another exercise keyboard workers reduced their errors by 50 per cent
when exposed to a citrus-scented atmosphere.
As for the specific ingredients, Japanese research claims lemon and
peppermint have a stimulating effect; nutmeg and lavender reduce stress and
a mix of rosemary and lemon will improve concentration.
David Fellowes, commercial director of Marketing Aromatics, is naturally an
enthusiast: 'Smell is the most powerful and evocative trigger we know. Yet
commercially smell has been the most under-used of the senses.'
Fellows says smells can be used in three broad ways: to provoke
physiological responses (such as animating people or reducing stress), to
bring back memories or associations (such as a Caribbean holiday), and to
encourage different attitudes (essentially what the manufacturers of most
cosmetic perfumes are aiming to achieve).
Marketing Aromatics lists a wide range of potential applications - from
developing corporate aromas as a sort of company logo and increasing
browsing time in shops to impregnating a product or packaging and improving
accuracy in repetitive manual tasks. It is reluctant to talk about clients -
except to point out it helped a bookshop which wanted to smell more like a
library - but says it has a growing number of inquiries.
Marketing Aromatics works with the perfume companies to develop the right
smells and is working with other companies on dispersal technology systems.
These are claimed to be capable of broadcasting different aromas into
several parts of a building at varying times of day.
In the US AromaSys of Minneapolis has researched the psychology, physiology
and technology of environmental fragrancing for three years. It is
developing systems for several Fortune 500 companies. Says Allyson Stewart,
of AAI Consultants: 'I think this whole subject is particularly interesting
from a corporate identity point of view. I believe the fragrance houses are
going to get more involved.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / People: Atterton joins Guinness Mahon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Atterton, 66, an industrialist and former director of the Bank of
England, has been persuaded to come out of semi-retirement and take on one
of the more challenging jobs in the City - the chairmanship of Guinness
Mahon Holdings.
Guinness Mahon, now owned by Japan's Bank of Yokohama, has been looking for
a new chairman for some months to replace Geoffrey Bell, 53, who is retiring
after five years at the helm. Like many small merchant banks, Guinness
Mahon's loan book has been been hit by the recession, but it has been
recapitalised and with a strong parent and a new management team it is keen
to re-establish its name in London merchant banking circles.
Although Guinness Mahon is a wholly-owned subsidiary of a Japanese bank it
intends to maintain its own identity and has been keen to recruit a
figurehead who commands respect in the City. Headhunter firm Norman
Broadbent was hired to find a suitable candidate.
Atterton has the right credentials. A former chief executive of Foseco, he
has sat on the boards of Marks and Spencer, 3i, and Barclays Bank, as well
as the Bank of England. He remains a director of Rank Organisation and
British Coal.
In addition, he describes himself as a Japanophile who speaks 'idiot'
Japanese. He was one of the first British industrialists to set up a
subsidiary in Japan which he chaired for 20 years. He says that the idea of
chairing a Japanese subsidiary in Britain appealed to him. Although the
initial idea was that he would do one day a week at GM, he expects to do
'significantly more'.

FT  11 MAR 93 / People: Big names for small business taskforces
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The small businesses which suffer most from the burden of red tape have
drawn scant comfort from the announcement of the chairmen of the seven
government taskforces which will look into the question of deregulation.
Their appointment follows the announcement by the government in early
February of a campaign to review the 7,000 items of legislation affecting
businesses.
The seven are Duncan Bluck, a director of John Swire and Cathay Pacific
Airways, to head the communications and transport taskforce; Chris Spackman,
managing director of Bovis Construction in charge of the construction
taskforce; Malcolm Bates, deputy managing director of GEC (engineering);
John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome (chemicals and pharmaceuticals); Sir
Sydney Lipworth, chairman of the MMC (financial services); Nigel Whittaker,
corporate affairs director of Kingfisher (other services); and Michael
Heron, chairman of the Post Office (food, drink and agriculture).
The DTI says it chose people who could command respect in the industry
sectors they were to examine and anyway small business owners probably would
not have the time to act as chairmen. It expects task force members to spend
half a day a week but chairmen will probably have to devote more time.
Small business organisations are not convinced. 'The targeting is wrong
because these people won't be aware of the problems affecting the 97 per
cent of businesses which employ fewer than 20 people,' said the Federation
of Small Businesses.
The DTI says it expects small business representatives to be among the task
force members and Nigel Whittaker says there are small business people among
the 8-10 people on his shortlist.
The task forces, which will work closely with Lord Sainsbury, Michael
Heseltine's special adviser on deregulation, have six months to complete
their work.

Chris Cawcutt, who resigned as personnel director of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew
last September, shortly after the sacking of the head of research Terry
Smith, has turned up as a partner of fledgling consultants Fairplace.
Set up six months ago by Colin Gardner, founder of publicly quoted
consultancy group D C Gardner, Fairplace now has 10 partners, including
49-year-old Cawcutt, and specialises in management development strategies,
principally for City firms.
Cawcutt has spent most of his career in personnel, including ten years at
Ford and a spell later at Lloyd's agency Merrett. After two years on the
management consultancy side of Touche Ross, he moved to UBS P&amp;D in 1989. He
is now at pains to downplay the role of the Terry Smith affair in his
departure.
'I resigned because I felt I had come to a stage in my career where I wanted
more control over my own destiny,' he said yesterday.
*****
Joe Hinton, president of Mobil Europe, will retire on April 1 and be
succeeded by Bill Walsh who is currently vice president for Middle East and
Marine Transportation. Walsh is based in Mobil headquarters in Fairfax,
Virginia, but will soon move to London.
Mobil Europe is responsible for the oil company's refining and marketing
operations in Europe - a separate division covers exploration and
production. The company changed its previously geographical organisation to
restructure along functional lines when Hinton took over in 1991.
Walsh has been with Mobil for 35 years, including a previous stint in London
as vice-president of manufacturing and supply.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): A smelling salt for
the market - Alice Rawsthorn asks whether Giorgio Armani's new fragrance can
revive sluggish perfume sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Giorgio Armani threw a party in Manhattan last month. His party planners
transformed a West 57th street basement into a replica of the theatre in his
Milan palazzo, complete with a grove of citrus trees.
The party was the climax of the Dollars 50m (Pounds 34.4m) launch of Gio,
the women's perfume developed for Armani, the Italian fashion designer, by
L'Oreal, the French cosmetics group. Gio has been on sale in Europe since
the autumn and was introduced to the US last month. So far it is ahead of
its European targets and has set records in the US. Saks Fifth Avenue, the
New York store, sold Dollars 250,000-worth of Gio in its first three days.
If Gio's success continues, L'Oreal should achieve its aim of creating a
classic perfume and a brand name from which to launch other fragrances and
cosmetics. But if its strategy falters and Gio loses momentum, L'Oreal's
Dollars 50m gamble will have failed.
Gio's progress is important not only to L'Oreal, but to the rest of the
Dollars 13.1bn perfume industry which desperately needs a fillip after three
grim years. The fragrance market has been destabilised not only by recession
but by the recent expansion of the leading players: LVMH, the French luxury
goods group, which launched Christian Lacroix perfume; Unilever, the
Anglo-Dutch consumer products company, which bought Calvin Klein fragrances;
and Elf-Sanofi, the French pharmaceuticals firm, which took over Yves
Saint-Laurent in January.
The development of Gio started two years ago when L'Oreal mapped out a new
strategy for Giorgio Armani fragrances, which it acquired in 1989 as part of
the takeover of Helena Rubinstein cosmetics. There were then two Armani
perfumes - a men's scent with respectable, if unspectacular, annual sales of
Dollars 50m and a women's fragrance with turnover of Dollars 10m.
'Giorgio Armani was an under-exploited asset,' said Georges Klarsfeld, head
of L'Oreal's fine fragrance division. 'He is one of the world's most famous
fashion designers with a classic, understated style that is just right for
the 1990s. We weren't making the most of the Armani name.'
L'Oreal began by finding a new product. It conducted 1,100 tests over 15
months to choose a scent which would appeal both in Europe and the US, where
consumers tend to prefer stronger, less subtle smells. It eventually chose a
blend of orange blossom and tuberose reflecting the current trend for
natural, floral fragrances.
'Choosing the product is only part of the story,' said Klarsfeld. 'There are
four components to a successful perfume - product, pricing, merchandising
and advertising. It's a bit like playing the slot machines at Las Vegas. If
you get four cherries you win the jackpot. If you get two or three you lose
everything.'
The 'jackpot' is to own one of the handful of classic perfumes, such as
Chanel No5 or Tresor (launched three years ago by L'Oreal), which make
annual sales of more than Dollars 120m. The profits are negligible initially
because advertising typically absorbs 75 per cent of sales in the first year
and 50 per cent in the second. But from the third year the advertising
budget falls to 30 per cent of sales. Given that production costs are so
small (less than 5 per cent) a classic then produces annual profits of
around Dollars 80m.
But the risk of failure is frighteningly high. The fragrance market is
intensely competitive thanks to the combination of recession and the
expansion of the large groups. Paine Webber in New York estimates that only
a fifth of the fragrances launched today will recoup their launch costs
within three years, compared with half six years ago.
The industry is littered with corpses. LVMH is said to have lost Dollars 40m
on C'est la Vie], launched four years ago for Christian Lacroix, the French
designer. L'Oreal's last big flop, Clandestine by Guy Laroche, was withdrawn
after only six months on the market. There is so much competition for
distribution that L'Oreal could not risk jeopardising its relations with
retailers.
In theory Gio, which is pitched in the middle of the fine fragrance market
with prices starting at Dollars 40, has the necessary ingredients for
success. L'Oreal has the financial clout to support the launch; it is
spending Dollars 50m on promotion for the first two years. The television
commercials are made by director David Lynch and the press advertisements by
Peter Lindbergh, fashion photographer.
In Japan, where the scent market is still small, L'Oreal is in the surreal
situation of planning to spend more on advertising in the first two years
than it expects to make in sales. 'It sounds crazy,' said Klarsfeld. 'But
we'll get our money back from duty-free sales to Japanese tourists.'
L'Oreal is also investing heavily in merchandising. Armani, who receives a
royalty on sales, has designed everything from the packaging to the display
counters and sales assistants' uniforms.
His involvement has encouraged retailers to support the launch. Saks Fifth
Avenue devoted all 35 of its windows to Armani products. The designer made
his first trip to New York for three years for the launch party, thereby
attracting pages of free publicity in the US fashion press.
Gio also has the advantage of being introduced at a time when there is a
significant change in fashion - away from the slick styles of the 1980s, to
the looser look of the 1990s - which could encourage consumers to try new
scents. It should also benefit from the dearth of other large launches.
Moreover, there are now signs of a recovery in the US fragrance market,
although European sales are still sluggish.
So far the omens are encouraging. But Klarsfeld has to wait a little longer
to see whether Gio has hit all 'four cherries' on his slot machine.
'The real test will be whether people buy it again for its second
Christmas,' he said. 'It's only then that we'll know if Gio is really a
success.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Accountancy Column: Do not try to deliver the undeliverable
 -The McFarlane report from the Auditing Practices Board is largely
misguided
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SNYDER and EMILE WOOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The consultation period for the McFarlane report from the Auditing Practices
Board on the future development of auditing closes later this month. We
believe its findings are largely misguided.
We favour a more effective system of monitoring and improving standards
within the existing statutory framework. We believe there are limits to the
assurance that auditors can reasonably be expected to provide to the
ever-widening range of users of accounts.
The APB's document, by contrast, invites auditors to accept responsibility
for delivering the undeliverable, and blurs the crucial distinction between
directors' and auditors' responsibilities. Its proposals are aimed at ending
the expectations gap, and indeed they will. But only by creating an abyss in
its place.
The paper criticises auditors' 'narrow interpretation' of their statutory
duties, causing them to focus on the company's past record as laid down in
company law. But these duties have been consistently and clearly laid down
in successive statutes since 1844 and there is little scope for
'interpretation', narrow or wide. A change in focus from past to future
performance would require rather more than a change in interpretation.
The APB says: 'There is a demand for auditors to recognise the interests of
a wider group than shareholders alone.' Indeed there is, and such an
awareness of other interests has been reflected in auditors' standard risk
assessment checklists and planning memoranda for a dozen years or more. Such
recognition of legitimate third party interests lies within the existing
framework of auditing.
The APB claims that the present scope of audit and the legal framework in
which it is conducted 'militates against auditors successfully meeting the
needs of shareholders and others with an interest in the audit process'. We
believe the problem lies rather with poor standards of auditing and the
seeming inability to date of the regulatory bodies or government to impose
any effective sanctions on the individuals and firms responsible.
It also overlooks the vast majority of audit appointments in which user
expectations are amply satisfied. In cases of widely publicised 'public
interest' scandals, auditors are invariably criticised for defective work
within existing law and standards.
The proposals ignore small company audits. This is consistent with the
composition of APB's own membership, and with the fact that it has not
produced any guidance on small company audits despite being presented with a
complete draft guideline by its predecessor body nearly two years ago.
The APB refers to 'perceived gaps in the scope of the audit, particularly
regarding directors' stewardship, future prospects and risks, fraud,
internal controls and interim reporting'. It is perhaps here that the lack
of realism that pervades the entire document shows most palpably.
This is a collection of wishful objectives; long on ends, but short on
means. All third parties - especially competitors and predators - would
dearly wish to have an objective evaluation of directors' performance and
stewardship, and of the company's future prospects and risks. But it is
grossly implausible to expect to receive such insubstantial indications from
any source, least of all from the statutory auditors.
The paper calls for auditors to report on the adequacy of 'financial and
other relevant risk management controls' and states that 'it is realistic to
expect auditors to respond to regulators' requests and to take on a role in
relation to a potentially growing demand for monitoring basic ethical
standards of corporate behaviour'.
It is in the nature of such ethereal notions that they are not readily
susceptible to audit scrutiny or analysis. If the regulators themselves,
with their unfettered statutory powers of investigation, cannot satisfy
themselves on these matters, can auditors be expected to do more?
In our opinion, if auditors are required to trespass on the realms of
regulators, audit committees and non-executives who are directly responsible
for corporate governance, their existing and sufficiently onerous reporting
functions will suffer serious neglect.
The APB proposes that directors should provide, and auditors report on, a
summary of the principal assumptions and judgments made by the directors in
preparing the financial statements. Normal audit procedures are already
designed to assess the reasonableness of the directors' assumptions and
judgments reflected in the accounts. If the auditors regard them as
reasonable, their separate disclosure would add nothing to the truth and
fairness of the accounts. If they regard them as materially unreasonable,
existing provisions require the audit report to be appropriately qualified.
The APB is anxious to involve shareholders directly with a view to resolving
the 'perceived lack of independence in the attitude of auditors and in the
conduct of their relationship with directors'. It suggests creating an
'audit panel' to represent shareholders, or a small group elected by
shareholders to meet the auditors to discuss issues arising from the audit.
Investors in listed companies do not see it as their responsibility to take
on any direct invigilating function in relation to the conduct of the
directors and auditors of the companies in which they invest. Only
institutional shareholders would be capable of making any sense of such a
role, and they are already quite clear as to their requirements from both
directors and auditors.
The remedy for both corporate and audit failure is to make existing legal
and disciplinary machinery more effective, not to involve shareholders in a
quasi-executive watchdog role.
We believe that the establishment of shareholder pressure groups will
seriously undermine the legal autonomy and accountability of both executive
and non-executive directors, and their ability to operate effectively in the
best interests of the shareholders as a body. The paper recognises the need
to rationalise the potential liability of auditors under the present legal
system before extending their roles and responsibilities. What it does not
address is the key issue of the exposure to litigation from all the third
parties embraced by a widening of audit accountability.
A flurry of law-reforming zeal follows every scandal-tainted wave of
collapses - whether induced by ineptitude, delinquency or just plain
daylight robbery. We are told that higher standards of stewardship and audit
need to be legislated. Yet every misdemeanour committed was already against
the law; and every failed audit was condemned by reference to current laws
and standards.
The sensible issues to focus on are therefore the enhancement and
enforcement of the laws and standards we already have. Audit regulation has
given the professional bodies more clout over the activities of their
membership than ever before. We need prompt disciplinary hearings,
widely-publicised findings, the suspension of audit registrations and
financial penalties that really hurt.
As to the costs, the scale of which are scarcely imaginable, we propose that
the panoply of beneficiaries of the APB proposals should be consulted on
what they are prepared to contribute towards this new age of auditing. In
our opinion that should settle the whole issue fairly efficiently and
conclusively.
In all other respects, the APB has produced a great paper.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Patients' complaint system
criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Health Service's system for handling complaints is attracting
growing criticism, Mr William Reid, health service commissioner, told MPs
yesterday.
Mr Reid said nearly a fifth of patients' complaints investigated in the
1991-1992 financial year by the commissioner's team, which acts as an
National Health Service watchdog, were about the service's procedure for
complaints. Three quarters were upheld as valid.
The total volume of complaints about the health service rose by 19 per cent
in the 1991-1992 year, to 1,176 - the highest since the post of health
commissioner was created.
Although these cases predated the introduction of the government's patients'
charter, which cited the improvement of the complaints procedure as one of
its goals, Mr Reid said he was continuing to receive criticism about the new
complaints system as well.
Patients have said staff were rude or unhelpful, and that their inquiries
had circulated back and forth between different offices, Mr Reid said.
Sir Duncan Nichol, chief executive of the NHS, insisted that measures were
being taken to train medical staff to be more sympathetic and effective in
dealing with complaints. Sir Duncan said: 'We are talking about changing
attitudes and the culture of the system.' He admitted that in this respect
the NHS 'still had a long way to go'.
He added: 'I do not see there is a flaw in the system, but people are not
operating the system to the standards that I wish.'
Although the NHS is planning a league table showing how health authorities
matched up to some aspects of the patients charter, their handling of
complaints would not be compared in this way, Sir Duncan said.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils warn PM over police role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RARE meeting between Mr John Major and leaders of local authority
associations ended with a familiar public difference of view between central
and local government yesterday.
The local leaders warned that they would resist any moves to reduce their
role on regional police authorities.
Councillors fear that in the review of the police service being carried out
by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, they will lose their majority
position on police authorities outside London.
In spite of this difference, both sides described the meeting as friendly
and constructive. Downing Street said that it had gone so well that Mr Major
had agreed to meet local authority representatives again next year.
The meeting, planned for some time, comes shortly after Mr Major's call for
both sides to 'stop batting one another round the head'. For several years
councillors of all political parties have felt bruised by the government's
grip on - and changes to - local government finance, as well as the
diminishing role councils have been given.
The local authority associations welcome talk of partnership and are hopeful
that Mr Major's 'listening mode' will mean that once the council tax has
settled down then ministers will relax the tight arrangements for limiting
local spending that they have insisted on for its intro-duction.
There was also an assurance that the government would accept its Commons
defeat on the European committee of the regions on Monday. The local
authority associations were behind the amendment on which the government was
defeated.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Gould warns of opposition to treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING opposition by Labour backbenchers to the Maastricht treaty was
forecast yesterday by Mr Bryan Gould, one of its leading opponents, Ivor
Owen writes. He was an unsuccessful challenger to Mr John Smith for the
party leadership.
He warned that if the treaty were ratified it would lead to permanently
entrenched deflation.
Mr Gould recalled that more than 60 Labour MPs joined Conservative
Euro-sceptics and MPs from minority parties in voting against the government
last May. He predicted that many Labour MPs would vote against the third
reading.
Mr Gould told a parliamentary press gallery lunch that if the treaty were to
be enforced there would be no escape route from handing over to unelected
bankers all the key decisions about economic policy.
Mr Gould maintained that for Labour to support the treaty would mean the
party abandoning its principles.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Contracts for civil servants
questioned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTRODUCTION of fixed-term contracts for senior civil servants was
unlikely to improve the quality of advice given to ministers, Sir Robin
Butler, head of the Civil Service, told a committee of MPs last night.
A switch to such contracts has been recommended by the European Policy
Forum, an influential free-market think-tank, following concern about the
quality of policy advice given to ministers.
Sir Robin told the all-party Treasury and Civil Service committee that civil
servants were less likely to give 'frank and fearless' advice if they were
employed under fixed-term contracts.
'Advice to ministers is more likely to be impartial if advisers do not see
the end of a fixed-term contract approaching,' he said. 'A willingness to
tell ministers that a particular action is wrong is encouraged by security
of tenure.'
Sir Robin rejected suggestions that standards of Civil Service behaviour had
declined in recent years.
He was concerned about public unease over the role of civil servants in
cases such as the sale of arms to Iraq revealed by the Matrix Churchill
trial and the payment of certain expenses on behalf of Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor.
But the particular cases were very different and he did not think they
indicated anything was wrong.
Sir Robin accepted that questions of Civil Service impartiality were bound
to be raised when one party had been in power for so long.
He said: 'Scepticism arises about whether the Civil Service is able to serve
a government of another party with equal commitment. I believe that it
could, and all civil servants were concerned to demonstrate that they could
in the run-up to the last election.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Clarke rebuffs Blair on terrorism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR's call for talks with the government aimed at re-establishing a
bi-partisan approach to terrorism in Northern Ireland and mainland Britain
was dismissed as a 'smokescreen' by Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary,
in the Commons last night.
Following his lead, Tory backbenchers repeatedly attacked Mr Tony Blair,
shadow home secretary, accusing him of giving encouragement to terrorism
while criticising the government for not being tough enough in dealing with
the general crime wave.
Mr Clarke insisted there could be no justification for Labour MPs holding to
the course they adopted in 1983 by voting against the annual order renewing
the Prevention of Terrorism Act introduced by the last Labour government.
At one point Mr Blair complained of 'barracking' by Tory MPs as he argued
that independent advisers had recognised that there were fundamental
objections to continuing the home secretary's powers to make orders
excluding terrorist suspects from mainland Britain.
Mr Blair also said there was widespread support for the view that a judge,
and not the home secretary, should decide whether terrorist suspects could
be detained by the police without any charge being made for more than four
days.
The Order to continue the Act's provisions for another year was approved by
329 to 202, a government majority of 127.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour promise on investor rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday pledged measures to protect individual and employee
shareholders in the latest of a series of attacks on what the party sees as
the government's failure to stand up to vested interests in the City and
elsewhere.
Mr Stuart Bell, the party's City spokesman, claimed merchant bankers,
lawyers and accountants had practiced the 'black art' of creative
accountancy to deprive individual shareholders of proper investment
information.
'They made a mockery of the share-owning democracy and popular capitalism,'
he said, addressing the Institute of Credit Management.
By using a range of devices including off-balance sheet financing and
inflated asset values, he added, 'a massive hoodwinking of the individual
investor was perpetrated'.
Mr Bell proposed a series of measures to redress the balance in favour of
smaller shareholders.
He said a Labour government would:
Build on the government's statutory obligation for auditors to report
alleged fraud, giving the regulatory auditing authorities greater powers to
ensure that balance sheets reflected not only the true and fair state of a
company but also whether it was a going concern.
Examine the question of allowing investors in employee share owning schemes
to elect 'one of their own' to company boards.
Extend existing share option schemes to cover employees of subsidiary as
well as parent companies.
'We need to empower individual shareholders to play a full part in company
development by encouraging them to participate,' Mr Bell said.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine accused of 'discourtesy'
to MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine came under renewed fire for his handling of the
government's energy review yesterday when he was charged with 'grave
discourtesy' in the Commons by the Labour chairman of the trade and industry
committee.
Mr Richard Caborn made the charge after the trade and industry secretary's
decision to use a recent debate on manufacturing to comment on the
committee's recent report on coal.
Mr Caborn was supported by Mrs Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker of the House,
who said she was 'delighted' at the committee's decision to raise the matter
directly with Mr Heseltine.
The criticism came as it emerged that the cabinet could get its first chance
to discuss plans for saving coal pits next week, after what appears to be a
concerted expectation-lowering exercise in Whitehall.
Firm decisions seem unlikely until the week after at the earliest. However,
indications are that the results of the government's energy review will not
be delayed beyond this month.
The government yesterday underlined its rejection of proposals which would
curtail the amount of electricity supplied from France via the French
interconnector. Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, assured his French
counterpart it was 'not legally possible' to prevent the import of French
electricity via the link.
But Mr Eggar said he made it clear to Mr Andre Billardon, the French energy
minister, that Britain anticipated 'growing exports' of electricity to
France.
He said Mr Billardon had confirmed that access to the French electricity
market was available to UK suppliers on a non-discriminatory basis. Further
discussions on the non-leviable status for supplies of electricity from
France would take place early next week.
The Commons committee, among 39 proposals, recommended that electricity
supplied from France would cease to be non-leviable and that Electricite de
France's ability to negotiate contracts to supply baseload electricity from
1993 should be conditional on UK generators having non-discriminatory access
to the French electricity market.
Ministers and officials are emphasising the extremely narrow range of
options available to Mr Heseltine, particularly as no contracts have been
agreed yet with the electricity generating companies.
There is hope in Whitehall that the threat of a strike by miners has
tempered some of the sympathy among potentially rebellious Conservative
backbenchers.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Redwood picks joint venture
developments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW AIRPORT for Sheffield, a power station for London's Docklands and a
bridge across the Tyne are among 21 development projects identified
yesterday by the government as candidates for joint ventures between private
investors and public authorities.
The projects, costing more than Pounds 1bn, were identified by Mr John
Redwood, environment minister, in an effort to persuade construction
companies and banks to take advantage of Treasury rule changes which make it
easier to raise private finance for infrastructure developments.
The changes, announced in the Autumn Statement, mean that public subsidies
may be used to supplement private investment in schemes which otherwise
might not go ahead.
Treasury guidelines, stipulating that private-sector schemes could proceed
only if they were cheaper than public-sector proposals, have also been
relaxed.
Many of the schemes proposed by Mr Redwood would involve handing over
publicly owned land for commercial development to private investors.
Companies would be able to use profits from property developments to help
pay for infrastructure investments.
Mr Redwood said that in other cases private investment would be supplemented
by local authority capital receipts and the existing Pounds 600m-a-year
urban development corporation, urban partnership and City Challenge budgets.
He said that at least one British financial institution was considering
launching an 'infrastructure investment fund' to take advantage of new
opportunities.
He expected the ratio of private to public investment to be much greater
than 'the normal four-to-one or five-to-one'. In some cases schemes might be
financed totally by the private sector. Mr Redwood will outline his
proposals to senior construction company executives later this month.
The plans include a Pounds 55m Sheffield airport. A private investor would
build and operate the airport and receive 50 acres of land for a business
park from the Sheffield Development Corporation.
A private developer of a Pounds 100m road tunnel under the Tyne would be
allowed to use tolls from the existing tunnel to help pay for construction.
The deal would be similar to arrangements used for the Dartford Bridge
across the Thames.
Mr Redwood said the developer of a Pounds 200m shopping centre at Trafford
Park in Manchester, approved last week by Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, might be prepared to help fund a Pounds 60m extension to the
Manchester Metrolink.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Iraq arms inquiry aims for early
hearings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLIC HEARINGS in the judicial inquiry into the arms-for-Iraq affair are
expected to be completed before parliament rises for the summer recess,
sources close to the inquiry said yesterday.
Lord Justice Scott, who is heading the inquiry, plans to set out before
Easter details of how the hearings will be held.
Lord Justice Scott was appointed to lead the inquiry in November last year
after documents released during the trial of senior management of Matrix
Churchill, the UK maker of machine tools, indicated the possible involvement
of government departments in defence or military-related trade with Iraq in
the years before the Kuwaiti invasion.
The hearings will almost certainly involve current and former ministers.
Lord Justice Scott is preparing a list of who will be called.
Some members of the inquiry team favour the hearings being monitored on
closed-circuit television to enable as many journalists as possible to view
the proceedings.
The intention to finish public proceedings while parliament is in session is
significant, because it suggests that opposition spokesmen will be able to
press ministers on their testimony with the protection of parliamentary
privilege by tabling written and oral questions.
Parliament would normally rise for the summer recess in late July, but there
are suggestions at Westminster that this might be delayed by the progress of
the Maastricht bill.
It is understood that Lord Justice Scott wants the hearings to take place
while parliament is sitting as a political safeguard against any attempt by
officials at prevarication.
Lawyers advising in recent cases relating to exports to Iraq have voiced
concern about the possibility that Lord Justice Scott may face obstruction
from officials and ministers refusing to give evi-dence.
Yesterday Ms Liz Symons, general secretary of the Association of First
Division Civil Servants, the trade union representing the top ranks of the
Civil Service, said that a number of her members were worried that any
evidence they might give to the Scott inquiry could involve a breach of the
Official Secrets Act or their employment contracts, which contain
confidentiality and loyalty clauses.
It emerged yesterday that all eight members of the Scott inquiry team,
including three officials seconded from the department of trade and industry
and the Treasury solicitor, have been vetted by the security services.
Lord Justice Scott has called for and received numerous documents from a
number of government departments and from the intelligence services.
He is also understood to have received documents from the US and studied
other independently provided evidence relating to exports to Iraq which has
recently come to light.
The evidence includes a hand-written minute by a civil servant on August 24
1989 and details of how the UK exported machine tools worth millions of
pounds for Iraq's poison gas programme, reported in a recently published
book by British journalist Mr John Sweeney.
Lord Justice Scott's office said last night: 'It is obviously important for
witnesses not to feel inhibited about speaking freely to the inquiry and we
shall do everything we can to ensure that.'
It is understood that Lord Justice Scott intends to spell out what legal
protection will be offered to witnesses as he approaches them individually
over the next month.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Political Notebook: At risk of sudden death
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Mr Norman Lamont next Tuesday's Budget is a sudden-death affair. If it
flops, the calls for a new chancellor will become deafening. Mr Lamont will
be gone from the Treasury by the summer recess.
A well judged and well received package would not guarantee his position -
those close to Mr John Major insist he will not make up his mind until the
summer. But with the prime minister weakened by the corrosive conflict over
Maastricht Mr Lamont would have a fighting chance of holding on.
It is an unenviable position for the chancellor, and is made no easier by
the uncertainty which still surrounds the economy's emergence from
recession.
The prevailing view in the cabinet - shared incidentally by Mr Major - is
that recovery is already under way. The drastic loosening in monetary policy
since September's ERM debacle should deliver a significant boost to demand
and incomes. Sterling's devaluation has given exporters a competitive edge
in overseas markets. The US economy is growing strongly. The housing market
shows signs of long-forgotten stability.
But if it is rare now to find a cabinet minister who is anything but upbeat
in private conversation, it is equally difficult to find one who is willing
to be anything like as optimistic in public.
No one is sure whether the recovery they believe is happening has more than
shallow roots. No one quite knows what will be the impact of a slide into
deeper recession in the rest of Europe. Unemployment casts a long and dark
shadow. No one is inclined to be caught out by another false dawn.
So the temptation for Mr Lamont is to do very little next Tuesday, to
announce a distinctly modest increase in personal taxation and spend the
money on a few eye-catching measures to help industry and cut the dole
queues. Fiscal rectitude can be promised for a future occasion.
In the judgment of most of his cabinet colleagues that would be a bad
mistake for Mr Lamont, for the economy, and for the government's authority.
In spite of their concern about the fragility of recovery there has been a
decisive shift in the Lord Howe, the author of the austerity budget which
marked the end in 1981 of an earlier recession, caught the flavour with his
call in the Financial Times this week for a radical reform of the tax system
to generate new revenues. Mr Lamont should choose virtue over instant
popularity.
The chancellor should not despair. Adversity brings its own opportunities.
It is true that the FT's survey of pre-Budget opinion on the Tory back
benches underlines his personal vulnerability. Nearly two thirds of Tory MPs
judge his performance to be no better than fair or disappointing. In a
comparable survey last year that figure was less than 40 per cent.
But the survey underlines also their willingness to swallow some bitter
pills.
If Mr Lamont can project a coherent medium-term programme to get the
government out of its present fiscal mess then Tory MPs will accept an
austerity Budget.
More than half actively support tax increases of one sort or another as part
of a strategy to reduce the deficit. About half that number believe Mr
Lamont must make a substantial down payment next week.
Even those who would prefer him not to renege on the Conservatives' election
pledges to reduce personal taxation appear ready now to accept some discreet
increases.
Not, of course, rises in income tax rates. Only a few brave souls suggest he
should tamper with those. But more that half are willing to see Mr Lamont
reduce the amount homeowners receive through mortgage interest relief. Not
so long ago a threat to that particular tax distortion would have provoked a
revolt of Maastricht proportions.
Similar numbers are ready to see VAT extended to domestic fuel - dressed up,
of course, as a 'green' tax - and to newspapers. They will acquiesce if Mr
Lamont decides against indexing income tax allowances. Most are braced for
much higher fuel - 'green' again - tobacco, and alcohol duties.
The price the backbenchers are demanding is small. They want incentives to
restore industrial confidence - through improved capital allowances and
special measures to help small businesses. About half would like a
post-Budget cut in interest rates - the rest still worry about the exchange
rate.
They want a renewed squeeze on public spending in the summer. But above all
else the government's supporters want a signal that the chancellor has
recovered his grip.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Motion attacks lease law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN Labour MPs yesterday tabled an early day motion calling for the repeal
of a 'draconian' law under which anyone who signs a lease on commercial
premises can be forced to pay the rent owed by a subsequent tenant who
defaults.
The motion 'noted with dismay' the failure to implement the 1988 Law
Commission report in lifting 'the burden of medieval privity law'.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Guiding light for mandarins: The recession has failed to
hurt one of the Treasury's industrial advisers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY must wish all its economic advisers had the characteristics of
Mr Ivan Bradbury.
For Mr Bradbury - owner and chairman of fast-expanding electronics company
Interconnection Systems - the recession has never happened.
The physicist-turned-entrepreneur is a member of the Treasury's industrial
prospects committee, which meets quarterly.
He reckons succeeding in business is a matter of following simple rules:
investing in technology and people, close contact with customers and
treating exports in the same way as domestic sales.
Since Mr Bradbury set up his Pounds 37m-turnover company eight years ago
staff has doubled to just over 600 and the business has become consistently
profitable.
Interconnection Systems' progress has been all the more noticeable given
that it is based in South Shields, Tyneside - mainland Britain's biggest
unemployment blackspot, where one worker in five is without a job. A
business associate says of the 46-year-old Mr Bradbury: 'Much of the success
is down to him. He can be a difficult character, but he's bloody intelligent
and prepared to work exceptionally hard.'
Mr Bradbury is probably the least known but best paid member of the Treasury
committee, which was set up last year as part of a government drive to
improve links with manufacturers. The committee reports to Mr Alan Budd,
Treasury chief economic adviser. In the financial year to the end of last
April Mr Bradbury's earnings came to Pounds 333,000.
He thinks the Treasury initiative 'commendable', likening Treasury officials
to pilots flying with the windows blacked out. Although on the whole he
thinks the officials are 'very bright', he says that 'every now and again
they need glimpses of what is happening in the world outside'.
Mr Bradbury, whose previous jobs have included spells at the Ford car group
and US electronics company Raychem, came into contact with Treasury
officials after a meeting in the late 1970s with Sir Douglas Wass, Treasury
permanent secretary between 1974 and 1983. Sir Douglas recalls: 'I was very
impressed with Mr Bradbury. I learned a lot from him (about industry).'
In spite of his close ties with the Treasury, Mr Bradbury criticises
government economic policies for a 'lack of clear sets of values' in
economic management. He says the government 'stopped the economy dead in its
tracks' with the long period of high interest rates in the early 1990s.
Since then it has failed to do enough to help manufacturing growth, but has
relied on a 'simplistic' formula of trying to reduce inflation.
Following recent cuts in interest rates and signs that the economy may be on
the turn, Mr Bradbury is generally confident about recovery. Manufacturers
which cannot step up exports after the 15 per cent devaluation in the pound
since last September 'probably should not be trying'.
He urges the government not to jeopardise an upturn by raising taxes in next
week's Budget. 'At the moment people want to hear good news. The negative
impact of a tax increase would be considerable,' he says.
Interconnection Systems' main activity is making printed circuit boards  -
building blocks for a range of electronic products including telephones,
computers and automotive systems. Mr Bradbury owns 80 per cent of
Interconnection Systems through a holding company called Legibus, with
Schroder Ventures, an investment group, holding the rest of the shares.
The factory operates 24 hours a day and makes about 9m boards a year, nearly
half of them for export. Its customers include Mitsubishi, Daimler-Benz, BMW
and Motorola.
After buying the then lossing-making South Shields factory from the Plessey
electrical group in 1985, Mr Bradbury changed the management and invested
Pounds 25m in new automated machines.
In the financial year ending last April his company turned in a pre-tax
profit of Pounds 2.3m on sales of Pounds 31m. Profits are expected to be
about Pounds 3m this year.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Industrialists warn against tax increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRAGILE recovery may be on the way but could be jeopardised by negative
factors such as a Budget tax increase, the Treasury has been told by its
advisers from industry.
In reports sent this week members of the Treasury's industrial prospects
committee gave their views on activity in a range of sectors including oil,
chemicals, carmaking and engineering.
The reports were called for last week by Mr Alan Budd, Treasury chief
economic adviser. They will be used in briefing Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, before his Budget speech next Tuesday.
The committee, with a membership varying around 12, was set up last summer
to strengthen links between the Treasury and industry.
Mr Leslie Gunde, chief economist at engineering components group GKN and a
member of the committee, said in his submission there were 'increasing
indications' of sustainable economic recovery. He warned that 'any
precipitate measures to increase tax revenues may well damage still-fragile
confidence in industry'.
Mr Richard Freeman, chief economist at Imperial Chemical Industries and
another committee member, said signs of recovery were mixed. Increasing
taxes to curb the rising government deficit 'would be a very adverse move'
because of its impact on confidence and demand.
Ms Kate Barker, chief European economist at Ford, said that while the UK car
market looked poised for recovery, this trend was being offset by worsening
economic conditions in other parts of Europe.

FT  11 MAR 93 / MPs challenge 'harsh' rents on pubs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs YESTERDAY challenged Grand Metropolitan Estates about the 'harsh' rents
and other conditions imposed on pub leaseholders in its Inntrepreneur (IEL)
pubs joint venture with Courage.
IEL executives were cross-examined by the Commons agriculture committee,
which is examining the effects of beer orders which forced national brewers
to free a third of their pubs from exclusive beer supplies. Mr Richard
Alexander, Tory MP for Newark, said three Inntrepreneur pubs in a Yorkshire
village had been held by 11 different leaseholders last year. Of 654 pubs in
the county 639 lessees had left.
'Doesn't this indicate the harsh terms which brewers, and IEL in particular,
are imposing on their tenants?' he asked.
Mr Bob Williams, GM Estates chairman, said the pub trade in South Yorkshire
had been hit by uncertainty about the future of the mining industry. 'It is
causing pain and anguish all round,' he added.
Inntrepreneur's business failures had been fewer under the new leases than
under the former tenancies, although the rate had increased to 9.5 per cent.
He insisted: 'We have no interest in closing pubs.'
Ms Jean Corston, Labour MP for Bristol East, said there had been complaints
of rent increases of up to 150 per cent. She questioned the imposition of
penalty charges on lessees who failed to meet certain levels of beer
purchases.
Mr Williams agreed that penalties could be levied but said the conditions
were necessary to ensure that outlets were not converted from pubs to other
retail operations.
Mr Michael Foster, chairman of Courage, said one of the worst effects of the
beer orders had been to break down the relationships between brewer and
tenants. But leases were agreed only after a long period of negotiation, he
said.
Mr Peter Jarvis, Whitbread's chief executive, told the committee that the
disruption to the company's pub tenants was the 'biggest downside' to the
beer orders.
He added: 'The goodwill of 20 years was ruined overnight and it will take a
long time to rebuild their confidence.'
There had, however, been only 10 business failures among the company's 1,600
leaseholders.
Complying with the orders had cost Whitbread about Pounds 80m. 'The costs
have been massive not just in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, but in
terms of management time,' Mr Jarvis said.
Mr Roy Moss, chairman of Allied-Lyons' retailing operations, also estimated
compliance costs at Pounds 80m.
Bass calculated Pounds 134m costs. Mr Tony Portno, chief executive of Bass
Brewers, said the beer orders caused the 'most enormous diversion' from
planned strategies.

FT  11 MAR 93 / John Birt paid wife two company salaries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, the BBC director-general, paid his wife a total of Pounds
29,000 in 1991 as both a director of his private company John Birt
Productions and as a secretarial assistant.
The accounts for John Birt Productions for 1991 make it clear that Mrs Jane
Birt was paid Pounds 14,000 as a director. In addition there was an expense
of Pounds 15,000 for an unnamed secretarial assistant.
The revelation that the secretary was his wife will intensify controversy
because of the possibility that more of Mr Birt's earnings from the BBC were
taxed at basic rate instead of a higher rate.
Last week Mr Birt joined the staff of the corporation - six years after his
first appointment as deputy director-general in 1987 - following revelations
that for all of that time he had been a freelance consultant to the BBC paid
through John Birt Productions.
On Tuesday in a prelude to a conference on the future of the BBC Mr Birt was
asked by Mr Jeremy Isaacs in an interview on stage at the National Film
Theatre to name the secretarial assistant. Mr Isaacs is general director of
the Royal Opera House and a former chief executive of Channel 4.
Mr Birt declined to name the secretarial assistant. He told Mr Isaacs: 'It
seems to me I did satisfy the concern that this arrangement (having his BBC
salary paid through a private company) had been a way of me enjoying a
significant tax advantage. It is not right that I have to reveal every
detail of my personal matters. I don't intend to.'
On Monday Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, said that being paid through
his private company had saved Mr Birt Pounds 3,935 in tax in 1991. After
accountancy and administration charges, Ernst &amp; Young said, the net benefit
for the Birt household was Pounds 810.
It is clear that Ernst &amp; Young had full access to every detail of the 1991
accounts of John Birt Productions but they would not discuss them.
John Birt Productions would have deducted tax on both of Mrs Birt's
salaries. Mrs Birt's top tax rate is not known.
The chairman and vice chairman of the BBC board of governors were criticised
yesterday by Sir David Attenborough, the broadcaster and former BBC 1
controller, at a London conference. They should be 'monitors not managers'
he said.
Later Sir David said the John Birt contract with the BBC was an error and
one made by the chairman and the vice-chairman.
The BBC declined to comment last night other than to say that Mr Birt had
made it clear he would not reveal every personal detail on the matter.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Education drive urged on business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday urged business executives
to become more involved in education to ensure that young people leaving
schools and colleges had the skills employers needed.
Mr Patten said at a CBI conference in London that business was being given
more information about school performance through league tables on
examination results.
Employers who were unhappy about the standards of education of
school-leavers should take it up with the schools concerned.
'As a business customer you would not stand on the sidelines and make
general statements about the performance of your suppliers,' he said. 'You
would do something about it.'
Mr Patten said businesses had increasing opportunities to become involved in
education, through governing bodies, education-business partnerships and
Training and Enterprise Councils.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said at the same conference
said school league tables should be compiled by an independent body such as
the Audit Commission or Ofsted, the new schools inspectorate.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT ONE third of London's buses stayed in their depots yesterday as crews
staged a one-day protest strike over pay and conditions that a majority of
them have already accepted.
London Buses said no buses ran in some parts of the capital. Unions claimed
the strike - over pay cuts averaging Pounds 30 a week and extended hours -
was an 'overwhelming success'. They warned of another strike on Wednesday
unless management agreed to talks.
Mr Ollie Jackson, a TGWU transport union official, said his members had
signed new contracts and indicated that a prolonged dispute was unlikely.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Outdated Army tanks for sale
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PART OF the Army's outdated fleet of Chieftain tanks might be refitted for
sale to Pakistan, defence officials said.
Pakistan is considering buying up to 300 of the 850 Chieftains produced for
the Army in the late 1960s and early 1970s, according to the magazine Jane's
Defence Weekly. A consortium headed by GEC-Marconi is proposing an upgrade
package for the tanks.
Officials said any sale would probably be handled by private companies,
which would buy the tanks from the Ministry of Defence. They confirmed that
Pakistan was seen as a leading potential outlet.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Trident sub loses Pounds 250,000 sonar gear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S latest Pounds 650m Trident missile submarine lost a crucial part
of its defensive sonar equipment during sea trials, a parliamentary
committee was told yesterday, David White writes.
The all-party Commons defence committee also heard that delays in the
command system software meant the submarine could not fire torpedoes.
But it was told the system, designed by BAe-Sema, a joint venture between
British Aerospace and the Anglo-French Sema group, would be ready by the
time the vessel was deployed.
HMS Vanguard, the first of four Trident submarines, is due to enter service
in late 1994 or early 1995.
The towed array, costing about Pounds 250,000, is part of the specially
designed Sonar 2054 system provided by GEC-Marconi.
'We have not yet come up with any reason why it was lost,' Rear Admiral
Richard Irwin said. But it appeared there had been an assembly error by
either the supplier or VSEL, the submarine's builder.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Electricity group to boost gas sales to industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANWEB, the regional electricity supplier for Merseyside and North Wales,
yesterday signed a new contract to quadruple its sales of gas to industry
and commerce.
Manweb and East Midlands Electricity have been test-marketing supplies from
Alliance Gas, a joint venture between British Petroleum, Statoil of Norway
and Norsk Hydro. Manweb yesterday signed a contract with Alliance to take up
to Pounds 50m of gas over the next three years.
Alliance yesterday said it would buy gas from the Viking field, about 70
miles off the Lincolnshire coast in the southern half of the North Sea. It
is taking half the field's production from BP Exploration, which has equal
shares in the field with Conoco, the operator.
East Midlands is talking to Alliance about extending its experimental deal,
while Alliance is also pushing ahead with direct sales to industry. Mr Kris
Maroe, Alliance Gas's managing director, yesterday forecast total sales of
Pounds 100m a year by December. Domestic sales are not yet open to
competition, but Manweb said it was confident it could become 'a major
player' should British Gas's monopoly end.
Manweb's gas customers include Marks and Spencer Financial Services, based
in Cheshire; Chester and Liverpool city councils; Greater Manchester Police
and ICI Runcorn. Initial contact was through electricity sales liaison staff
who passed leads to gas specialists, the number of whom is to increase from
three to five.
Some sales are in the south of England to branches of national companies
based in the north-west.
Manweb pays British Gas for use of pipelines, the fee taking into account
the distance pumped and maintenance, although the gas involved comes from a
common supply into which British Gas and independent suppliers feed.
Alliance's gas comes from the North Sea, but Manweb has also been able to
bid successfully at auction for some excess British Gas supplies from its
Morecambe Bay field, cutting distribution costs to north-west customers.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Ford workers 'in battle for sheer survival': Robert Taylor
is told about job fears at Dagenham
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOOD earlier this week among car workers at a branch meeting of the
Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union across the road from Ford Motor
Company's paint, trim and assembly plant in Dagenham was both angry and
anxious.
'There is a lot of fear in the plant,' said one. 'Nobody feels safe.'
Another added: 'It's getting very brutal in there. Workers are being
fingered and told they are going to lose their jobs whether they like it or
not.'
Whether this truly reflects what the majority of workers think about the
company's threat of sackings if voluntary redundancy targets are not met may
be questionable. Ford wants 560 production workers out of 7,500 at Dagenham
to go and it is believed to be half way to that figure.
Some workers, however, see Ford's threat as the thin end of the wedge.
'We are in a battle for sheer survival,' explained one electrician over a
pint in the Mill House social club after the union meeting. 'The very future
of Dagenham is at stake. For every job in the plant there are another three
outside dependent on the company.'
Ford's sprawling complex in east London once enjoyed a reputation for
industrial militancy.
In the 1950s and 1960s it became a byword for unofficial strikes, tough shop
stewards and wage-push inflation among the emerging affluent working class.
It inflicted the last Labour government's first defeat in the 1978-1979
'winter of discontent', when Ford workers burst through the 5 per cent
incomes policy.
Now workers are very much on the defensive. 'We feel we have been pushed
around long enough,' said one maintenance worker.
'Men are being called off the line and told they're going to have to go,'
added another. 'One bloke I know on a training course was informed he was on
his way out.'
In other plants workers have received individual letters to tell them they
have no future in the company.
But in spite of the outpouring of complaints Ford might get its way.
The company will not disclose the general terms of its voluntary redundancy
scheme but it is telling workers individually they would be better off to
take the money while it is on offer.
Mr Seamus Riley, a 28-year-old electrician from County Galway, has worked
for Ford at Dagenham for nearly 4 1/2 years.
A single man and a shop steward, he does not want to give up his job but has
been told he is on the list of those who will have to go.
Like others he faces an invidious choice. If he agrees to leave before the
end of this month he will receive just over Pounds 6,650 in severance pay.
But he has been told that if he turns it down and is then dismissed he will
receive only Pounds 820 from the state redundancy scheme. 'The company are
not offering me enough and there are no other jobs in this area for
electricians,' he argues, waving his redundancy note.
But for many older workers the choice between cash in the hand now or a
pittance from the state next month may well prove decisive. 'It is bribery
but it has worked in the past,' admitted one local union official.

FT  11 MAR 93 / CBI proposes single framework for exams
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A UNIVERSAL system of credits enabling 16 to 19-year-olds to buy any course
of vocational or academic training, and to help bridge the continuing gulf
between the two, was proposed yesterday by the Confederation of British
Industry.
The CBI also suggested a single framework of examinations and qualifications
stretching from vocational NVQs to academic A levels in England and Wales,
and a system of awards mixing the academic and vocational called 'careership
certificates'.
Sir Bryan Nicholson, head of the CBI's education and training affairs
committee, who presented a report yesterday, said: 'The government has been
half-hearted in its approach to 16 to 19-year-old education and training. We
need bold moves to put a cohesive system in place.'
The CBI document said the report of the 1992 World Economic Forum ranked the
UK 20th out of 22 countries, just above Italy and Greece, for the quality of
its people's skills.
'Although government initiatives are producing results, the UK still
compares unfavourably with its competitors.'
The report calls for the extension of the training credit system to sixth
forms and further education colleges, integration of qualifications, a
'careership profile' for all 16 to 19-year-olds and additional investment in
careers guidance for all 14 to 19-year-olds.
The CBI says the UK and Greece are the only two European Community countries
where some careers teachers in schools receive no training.
The CBI says its plans for 16 to 19-year-olds would be broadly neutral in
public expenditure terms and cost employers only a little more.
The aim is to eliminate any employment for those under 18 not involving
structured education and training, but it insists this must be done
voluntarily.

FT  11 MAR 93 / OFT weighs extension of credit protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OFFICE of Fair Trading is investigating whether small companies should
be given similar protection to that available to the private individual
under the Consumer Credit Act.
The government has asked the office to establish whether small businesses,
as consumers of credit and hire services, are sufficiently protected by the
existing legislation. The move was announced yesterday by Sir Bryan
Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, at the annual conference of
the Institute of Credit Management in London.
At present sole traders and partnerships are treated in the same way as
private consumers, but limited companies, however small, are excluded.
The Consumer Credit Act requires credit organisations to provide purchasers
with detailed information on the total cost of credit and imposes
restrictions on credit companies repossessing goods if payments are not kept
up.
There was little support from the credit industry for a possible extension
of protection beyond individual consumers. The Finance and Leasing
Association said it would be inappropriate to extend the provisions of the
act to companies because it contains many detailed provisions that would be
unnecessary for the more sophisticated business customer.
Ms Victoria Mitchell, legal secretary of the association, which represents
more than 100 non-bank finance and leasing companies, said: 'The act assumes
a low level of knowledge on the part of the purchaser.'
Far from seeking to extend the act to limited companies, she said, the
association had been lobbying to remove sole traders and partnerships from
its cover. Some forms of credit, such as variable rate hire purchase
agreements, could not be offered to private individuals under the act but
were used by businesses. Extending the act would reduce credit options open
to business, she added.
Giving business users of credit extra protection would need specialist
legislation, which the association said would not be in tune with the
government's desire to reduce the burden of legislation on business.
Barclays Bank said only about 10 per cent of its business customers would be
affected by an extension of credit protection to companies because most were
sole traders or partnerships. Both the granter of the credit and the
customer would have to deal with more paperwork if the legislation were to
be extended, it added.
The OFT study forms part of a general review of credit legislation and
credit industry practices.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Code on directors' pay 'not followed'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY 16 of Britain's 100 largest companies meet the code of best practice on
disclosure of directors' pay spelled out last December in the Cadbury
committee report on corporate governance, a study published today shows.
The study by pay specialists Monks Partnership of the most recent annual
reports of FT-SE 100 companies shows that significant changes will be needed
to meet the code when it comes into force in June.
Although the code is voluntary, the study says companies are taking it
seriously and intend to change practices by June. Mr Simon Rodwell, a
director at Monks, said it was in companies' interests to follow the code as
compliance is to become a condition for listing of companies on the Stock
Exchange.
Companies must now disclose the aggregate of all directors' pay, and the
total pay of the chairman and of the highest paid director (when different).
The code requires them to separate out the level of bonus in total
directors' pay and in that of the chairman or highest paid director. They
will also have to explain the basis on which incentive pay is calculated and
disclose details of the committee that sets directors' pay.
The study finds most reluctance in declaring the bonus element in the
chairman's salary, with just 28 per cent complying. Only 46 per cent offered
any explanation for the calculation of bonus pay.
According to the report companies not complying with any of the code's
recommendations in their last annual report include Abbey National, BTR,
Lloyds Bank and Unilever. Companies that complied fully include Boots,
British Telecom, Tesco and TSB.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Finance warning on homes for rent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL institutions will be less willing to lend money to build homes for
rent if the government proceeds with cuts in the housing budget, the
National Federation of Housing Associations says.
The federation last night launched a campaign to persuade the government to
withdraw cuts announced in the Autumn Statement.
The grant paid to housing associations which build homes for rent would fall
from 72 per cent of the cost this year to 55 per cent in 1995-96. The
balance is raised on the capital markets.
The federation commissioned a study of the consequences of falling grant
rates from stockbrokers UBS Phillips &amp; Drew. This predicted that rents would
rise by 70 per cent over the next three years to meet the interest bill on
the higher proportion of private finance. Higher rents would increase the
number of housing associations dependent on social security benefits to 85
per cent.
This would make it harder for housing associations to attract private
finance, the federation warned. Investors would worry about the quality of
the income stream to service debt if it was too dependent on social security
benefits which could be cut in the future.

<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A 2000-acre new-town project on the outskirts of Peterborough has won
planning permission.
Most of the scheme, to be developed by Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, is
planned for derelict land formerly used to extract brick clay. The
developers say Peterborough Southern Township will be the largest
private-sector new town for more than 30 years.
The project, costing an estimated Pounds 500m, will comprise 5,200 houses, a
retail centre, and commercial and industrial land. Infrastructure work is
expected to start soon. The scheme should be completed by 2004.
The plans for the Peterborough Southern Township have been under
consideration for more than seven years.
The scheme won outline planning consent in September 1991. Final consent was
granted this week after agreement was reached on planning conditions.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Absenteeism higher for British-owned companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABSENTEEISM may have taken over from strikes as the British disease,
according to evidence published today by the Industrial Society. It says
workers in Japanese-owned companies in the UK take far fewer days off sick
than those working for home-owned companies.
Sickness absence is two-thirds higher for UK organisations than their
Japanese counterparts. The absence rate - the percentage of working days
lost a year - is 3.9 per cent for UK companies and 2.35 per cent for
Japanese-owned groups.
The findings come from a survey of 600 organisations by the Industrial
Society following employer concern about levels of absence among workers.
Government figures show that more than 200m working days and more than
Pounds 9bn in production is lost each year.
But the survey also shows that the absence rate for UK companies is down
substantially from 5.05 per cent in 1987. The recession was seen by managers
to have had a mixed effect - some employees improved their attendance
because they feared for their jobs, but others suffered increased stress.
The survey found Japanese companies could have greater success in
controlling sick leave because of better employee communications about the
number of absences and smaller working groups. Japanese companies were more
likely to ask candidates about their attendance record at interviews, and
find out why employees were away after every absence, however short.
Overall, managers did not always believe the reasons for absence offered by
workers. More than half of managers felt emotional and personal problems and
stress caused more absence than their employees were prepared to admit on
certification forms.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Kellogg faces second complaint
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Norwest Co-operatives has become the second retailer to report
Kellogg, the breakfast cereal giant, to the Office of Fair Trading for
cutting off its corn flake supplies.
The move follows a similar complaint to the OFT last week from Shoprite, the
Isle of Man-based discount retailer which has 40 stores in Scotland. Mr
Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, tabled a Commons
question to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, asking him
to investigate the Shoprite/Kellogg dispute.
United Norwest Co-operatives, one of the 10 biggest food retailers in
Britain, gave away coupons offering 10p off a 500 gramme packet of corn
flakes in a door-to-door leaflet promotion for its Discount Giant
supermarkets.
That defied a Kellogg letter to the grocery trade in January imposing on
500g packets a minimum price of 96p, since raised to Pounds 1.02.
In retaliation Kellogg has stopped all cornflake supplies - of whatever
packet size - to all the group's stores, including its Normid, Shopping
Giant and Late Shop outlets, where the vouchers could not be used. Attempts
to get alternative supplies from food wholesalers have failed. Mr Robert
Cawley, United Norwest's buying controller, said yesterday: 'They have told
us Kellogg will stop their supplies if they sell to us.'
The Co-op, which before Christmas was selling 500g packets of cornflakes for
as little as 80p, is alleging unfair trading and discrimination. Mr Cawley
said several competitors had been honouring the Co-op's 10p-off-Kellogg's
vouchers to win business, but Kellogg has not stopped their supplies.
Evidence to the OFT includes till receipts from competitors showing that the
discount had been applied to Kellogg's 500g cornflakes.
Although Kellogg gets the same wholesale price, cheap cornflakes in the
shops can distort competition with Kellogg's other cereals, especially when
these are being promoted in national advertising.
Kellogg said yesterday: 'It is unreasonable for retailers to use Kellogg's
brands as loss-leaders in order to build their overall business. With
immediate effect we will discontinue supplies to those retailers or
wholesalers who sell below cost for the purpose of loss-leading.'

THE Japanese electronics company Toshiba is licensing liquid crystal display
technology to Orion Electric, the South Korean company in which it has a
stake of just under 1 per cent, writes Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
Toshiba will license Orion with super-twisted pneumatic (STN) LCD technology
used mainly for screens on notebook PCs.
SNT LCDs are cheaper to manufacture than thin film transistor (TFT) LCDs,
which Toshiba is developing in a joint venture with IBM. The quality of SNT
LCDs, however, is inferior to that of TFT LCDs, in which many Japanese
companies are investing heavily.

THE CZECH government yesterday gave the go-ahead for completion of the
controversial Kcs68bn (Pounds 1.6bn) nuclear power plant at Temelin in
southern Bohemia.
The decision will be a relief to Westinghouse Corporation of the US, which
won two tenders to help to rehabilitate the plant. Its completion has been
strongly opposed by local environmental groups and by neighbouring Austria.
More than Kcs25bn has been spent on the plant, with orders for another
Kcs19bn placed for equipment, engineering and construction. Westinghouse
will provide high-quality fuels and upgrade the plant to western standards
with new control systems - two of the recommendations by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) after a study of the plant in 1990.
The original decision to build two Soviet-designed VVER (pressurised water
reactor) units of 1,000MW each was taken in 1977, but the plant was put on
ice after the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

<TEXT>
THINKING Machines, a US supercomputer manufacturer, is expected to lodge an
official protest against the decision by the Department of Energy's Lawrence
Livermore Laboratory in California to buy a supercomputer from Meiko
Scientific, a British-owned company. The Dollars 15m sale, if completed,
would be the first of its kind to a US government laboratory from a non-US
company.
The deal has already been clouded by controversy surrounding Meiko's sale of
high-performance computers to Israel in 1991, after Washington refused
export licences to US manufacturers.
Mr Danny Hillis, president and co-founder of Thinking Machines, a US leader
in the field of 'massively parallel supercomputers', which combine the power
of hundreds of microprocessor chips to achieve record processing speeds,
said he did not believe Meiko had met all the specifications. 'Our issue is:
has there been a fair bidding process?' It appeared that the Meiko
supercomputer might be a prototype, whereas the laboratory had specified
that it would buy only a proven product. He also believed that Meiko might
be infringing some of his company's patents.
Thinking Machines must wait until Lawrence Livermore finalises a contract
before it can obtain full details of the Meiko computer. It will then have
10 days to file a formal protest, forcing the government laboratory to prove
that it has conducted the procurement competition fairly.
Mr David Alden, president of Meiko, maintains that Meiko won the contract in
an open competition with US manufacturers. He also rejects charges that it
made 'ill advised' exports to Israel. Meiko obtained export licences from
the British Department of Trade, he said, and the computers sold to Technion
University were not true supercomputers.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'Big Three' US motor companies - Ford, GM and Chrysler - yesterday urged
the Clinton administration to negotiate a 'results-oriented' pact with Japan
which would achieve a bilateral trade balance on a specific schedule.
Mr Peter Pestillo, an executive vice-president of Ford Motor Company, told
the Senate commerce committee they were recommending a five-year schedule
with regular monitoring.
'Japan can make its own decisions as to how to achieve this goal - by
importing more, or exporting less, or both,' he said. 'What we need is
results-oriented policy, not 'regrets' about not meeting targets, as in the
recent semiconductor case.'
On Tuesday, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade representative, told the Senate
finance committee the administration was seriously studying a similar plan
to negotiate goals for Japanese imports called 'temporary quantitative
indicators'.
The Big Three laid out a case for government assistance based on their
massive reinvestment in recent years - Dollars 61.3bn (Pounds 43.1bn) from
1989 to 1992 - and the importance of the domestic industry to the US
economy. The US trade deficit with Japan has remained at Dollars 32bn a year
since 1986.
Mr Pestillo said the main Japanese producers were 'dumping' cars in the US
at prices 14 per cent below those charged in Japan.
'In 1991 the top seven Japanese automakers earned Dollars 8.5bn in Japan,
while losing Dollars 1.4bn and Dollars 3.6bn in North America,' he said. 'In
the past four years they earned an average of more than Dollars 9bn in
Japan, while losing an average of more than Dollars 3bn in North America and
almost Dollars 1.4bn in Europe.'
The US industry decided not to bring a dumping case against Japanese
producers in order to give the new administration time to find 'a private
remedy', Mr Pestillo said.

FT  11 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japanese license French high-tech
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE Japanese companies have signed a technology licensing agreement with
Bull, the French state-owned computer group, that will allow them to use
Bull's patented technologies for IC (integrated circuit) card technology.
Toshiba, Hitachi, Oki Electric, Toppan Printing and Kyodo Printing have
agreed to pay a fee to license technology owned by Bull's integrated circuit
card company, Bull CP8, covering 500 areas related to IC cards and
reader/writer machines. The value of the licensing deals is not revealed.
Bull already has agreements with Toshiba, Hitachi, NEC, Sharp and Oki
Electric to license its self-programmable one-chip microcomputer (SPOM)
patent which covers technology for single-chip microcomputers used in IC
cards.
The deals represent an unusual example of high technology flowing from
France to Japan, rather than vice versa.
SPOM technology enables memory, microprocessors and programmes to be put on
a single chip, thereby reducing significantly the cost of manufacturing
integrated circuit cards.
The IC card market in Japan is expected to grow to between Y1,000bn (Pounds
5.8bn) and Y2,000bn (Pounds 11.7bn) as IC cards are used increasingly to
replace keys in intelligent buildings, to record personal medical
information and eventually as a replacement for money.

JAPANESE electronics manufacturers are undercutting prices of EC-made
television camera systems by up to 65 per cent, according to European
producers.
The European Commission yesterday opened a formal anti-dumping inquiry into
Japanese television camera imports after complaints from Philips of the
Netherlands and Thomson of France that systems were being sold in the EC at
well below the price in Japan.
According to the Commission, Japanese exports of the studio cameras to the
EC are worth Ecu30m (Pounds 24.78m) a year.
The Commission has also begun investigating alleged dumping of electrical
components by South Korean and Taiwanese producers, following a similar
probe into Japanese manufacturers' exports last year.
Philips, BH Components of the UK, and Roederstein of Germany complain that
large aluminium electrolytic capacitors from Korea and Taiwan have been sold
at prices between 9 and 17 per cent lower than competing EC-made components.
The capacitors are used in a wide variety of consumer electronics products.

NATIONAL POWER, the UK's largest electricity generator, and Jaiprakesh
Industries, an Indian engineering and manufacturing company, yesterday
signed an agreement which could lead to the building of a Pounds 260m
coal-fired power station in Karnataka, India.
The agreement to conduct a feasibility study for a 300MW power station in
Mangalore is seen as the first step in setting up a joint venture to build,
own and operate the plant.
The move is the latest in a diversification programme by the UK company
through which it aims to invest Pounds 1bn overseas by the end of the
century. Jaiprakesh is planning a steel plant in Karnataka, which the power
plant would supply.
National Power and Jaiprakesh are seeking a third partner for the project
and aim later to allow other Indian investors to acquire shares.
Mr Graham Hadley, a National Power executive director, said his company was
looking at several opportunities in India but the Karnataka scheme was its
lead project. Mr S K Dixit, Jaiprakesh managing director, said the promoters
would be putting up Rs3bn (Pounds 65.9m) equity for the Rs12bn venture.
Government clearance would be sought after preliminary studies were
completed.

semiconductors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE semiconductor industry has raised its voice in protest against
recent criticism from the US over Japan's expected failure to fulfil a
bilateral agreement on foreign market share of the Japanese semiconductor
market. That was supposed to reach 20 per cent by the end of last year; the
third quarter figure was almost 16 per cent.
The Electronics Industry Association of Japan has published a report on the
1991 US-Japan Semiconductor Arrangement, which tries to clarify what the
bilateral agreement calls for and to explain why the 20 per cent market
share figure the US has focused on is not a fair measure of the improvement
in foreign access to the Japanese semiconductor market.
The report comes as the US Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) has
become increasingly insistent that Japan meet the 20 per cent target.
Last week, the SIA said that, if Japan failed to comply with the agreement,
it would 'work closely with the Clinton administration to seek redress and
pursue appropriate measures to ensure compliance'.
The EIAJ has responded with a clear protest against the SIA's stance. The 20
per cent figure, as it appears in the agreement, 'represents the US industry
expectation, not a guarantee', it says.
Furthermore, the 20 per cent figure should not be taken as the only measure
of whether access to the Japanese semiconductor market has improved, it
says.
Since the original US-Japan Semiconductor Arrangement was signed in 1986,
foreign market share has more than doubled from 8 to about 16 per cent;
sales of foreign semiconductors have more than tripled from Dollars 1bn to
Dollars 3.2bn.
Nor is overall market share a completely reliable measure of progress in
foreign access to the Japanese market, says the EIAJ. Foreign semiconductor
manufacturers are not competitive in semiconductors for consumer
electronics, which comprise about 42 per cent of the Japanese semiconductor
market against only 5.3 per cent in the US. Also, in certain other product
categories, US companies do not have a sufficient supply to service Japanese
demand.
Rather than focus on the failures, it says, the US should look at how much
the agreement has achieved. The 1991 agreement has resulted in increased
foreign sales in Japan, greater foreign market share, design-ins and joint
relationships. As such, it is having its intended effect, the EIAJ report
concludes.
With a bilateral meeting to determine last year's the foreign market share,
due next week, the report's unwritten plea seems to be that the US should
refrain from taking any rash decision that could undermine progress made so
far.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAKERS of pharmaceuticals in the US are to ask the Justice Department for an
exemption from prosecution under US anti-trust laws so that they can discuss
ways to control drug prices.
The drug industry has come under attack in recent weeks from Congress and
from the Clinton administration.
It is confronted by claims that its products are more expensive in the US
than in other countries, and that it has failed to fulfil pledges to limit
price rises to the rate of US consumer price inflation.
But, at a meeting with White House officials this week, representatives of
the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers' Association and of the major drug
companies endorsed President Bill Clinton's blueprint for reforming the US
health care system and gave their support to specific measures to curb price
increases.
The drug-makers' association will send a letter to the Justice Department by
the weekend to ask for permission for companies to discuss price restraints
and enforcement mechanisms. Such discussions would ordinarily be outlawed by
US anti-trust laws.
The association also urged the administration to seek commitments to price
restraint from individual companies. Already ten leading US manufacturers,
representing about 40 per cent of the market, have independently made such
pledges.
At the meeting this week with Mr Ira Magaziner, a senior White House adviser
on domestic policy issues, the industry representatives gave their support
to the 'managed competition' approach which Mr Clinton has adopted to health
care reform.
They also supported the inclusion of prescription drugs in the standard
insurance benefits package which would be a component of the managed
competition approach.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Mexican party funding limited
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TIJUANA, MEXICO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) has agreed to accept
a limit of 1m new pesos (Dollars 320,000) on individual contributions to the
party.
The decision follows a public outcry over disclosures that the PRI had
solicited donations of hundreds of millions of dollars from wealthy
businessmen.
The reversal came after opposition parties and the public had denounced a
dinner at which 30 select businessmen had been asked to give some Dollars
25m each to the party's trust fund.
The Mexican independent press and the opposition argued that the huge
donations would make it impossible for the latter to compete on equal terms
in the next presidential election. PRI members also complained that the
businessmen's contributions would give them excessive influence over the
party, which has long enjoyed the support of labour and peasant
organisations.
President Carlos Salinas explained the reversal: 'Among the militants in the
parties, and among public opinion, there has been expressed, with reason,
concern that the donations are excessive and concentrated, and that they
represent an undue influence.'
The limitation of 1m new pesos will only apply to contributions to the
party's trust fund. However, a presidential spokesman said that Congress
would soon debate legislation aimed to limit contributions to electoral
campaigns. The PRI also said that it would only accept money from
individuals and social organisations, not from incorporated businesses.
The PRI will go ahead with other fund-raising, such as its national lottery
and credit cards for 500,000 sympathisers. It will still be much better
endowed than other opposition parties, thanks in large part to its
continuous presence in power for the past 64 years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR P J PATTERSON, prime minister of Jamaica, has called a general election
for March 30, eleven months before it is constitutionally due.
He said he was seeking his own popular mandate, a year after he took office
on the resignation of Mr Michael Manley. The early election, however,
appears to have been determined by opinion polls showing a healthy lead for
the incumbent People's National Party.
Last month, polls gave the PNP a 12-point lead over the opposition Jamaica
Labour Party, led by Mr Edward Seaga, a former prime minister. The JLP
started to campaign a fortnight ago after indications that Mr Patterson was
considering a snap election.
The main issue in the campaign will be the economy of the Caribbean island
of 2.3m. Mr Patterson's administration has continued the programme of
extensive deregulation started by Mr Manley, including the liberalisation of
the island's foreign currency market.
Mr Seaga has argued, though, that the government has gone overboard in
deregulating the economy and was abandoning some of its responsibilities.
The incumbent party's support has been lifted in recent months by
indications of stability in the economy. The Jamaican dollar has depreciated
rapidly after its flotation 18 months ago, and inflation for the first nine
months of the current fiscal year was 17.9 per cent, against 73.1 per cent
for the equivalent period of the last fiscal year.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Bank regulations eased to encourage lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERAL US bank regulations are being relaxed to help encourage renewed
lending, particularly to small business, President Bill Clinton announced
yesterday.
It would make it easier for well-capitalised banks to make 'character loans'
based on their judgment of the borrower, rather than on detailed
documentation and collateral, without incurring the suspicions of bank
supervisors.
Mr Clinton also wants to raise the threshold below which appraisals will not
be required for property loans, and stop the appraisal requirement when
property is offered as additional collateral for a business loan. Loans
secured by property should be valued on the basis of the borrower's ability
to pay over time, rather than on the assumption of immediate liquidation.
Supervisory agencies will also institute a process for banks to appeal
against a supervisor's decision, as well as procedures for handling
complaints from banks and from the general public.
The measures have been widely trumpeted by the Clinton administration as a
blow against the 'credit crunch', a constriction on lending that many
bankers claim has been caused by excessive regulations. However, bank
supervisory agencies expect them to have only a marginal impact on lending,
arguing that new legislation would be needed to achieve a greater effect.
'There is very little we can do simply by changing regulations. Most of what
we do is dictated by the law of the land,' said Mr Lawrence Lindsay, a
member of the Federal Reserve Board, in a speech earlier this week.
Congressman Henry Gonzalez, chairman of the House of Representatives banking
committee, has also warned President Clinton not to undo necessary bank
safety regulations implemented to stop the rash lending that led to the bank
debacle of the late 1980s.
'The truth is that all too many banks are taking the easy route of investing
in Treasury securities rather than putting in the time and effort required
to make a consumer loan,' Mr Gonzalez complained recently.
Mr Charles Bowsher, the US comptroller general, has also defended the need
for the additional safety and soundness regulations passed in new banking
legislation in 1991.
'It would be foolish, in my view, to attempt to periodically weaken and
tighten bank regulation in response to recession and inflation.
'Had the banking industry not dissipated its capital in the 1980s by making
so many bad loans, it would have been better able to handle some of the
problems encountered in this recession,' Mr Bowsher said in recent testimony
to Congress.
However, a study by regulatory agencies estimated the cost of regulatory
burden on banks at somewhere between Dollars 7.5bn and Dollars 17bn in 1991.

subsidies will be phased out. Canada's central bank rate declined 23 basis
points yesterday to 5.66 per cent from 5.89 per cent a week earlier. The
total decline since late last November is now 316 basis points and the
Canadian dollar has weakened after two weeks of continuous strength. The

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPTIAN security forces have shot and killed 14 alleged militants in a
bloody two-day crackdown on Islamic groups behind recent attacks on
tourists. At least four policemen, a woman and a child also died in the
raids - among the bloodiest clashes in Egypt in a decade.
Thirteen people died in shootouts in and around Cairo yesterday as police
and special operations officers launched nine dawn raids on alleged Islamic
militant hideouts. A further seven alleged militants died in a clash on
Tuesday night after police surrounded a mosque in Aswan, the popular tourist
resort in Upper Egypt.
The incident is only the second in Aswan since the recent spate of violence
in Egypt. Two police officers guarding a church were shot dead by militants
on March 6 and Tuesday's raid appears to have followed a tough police
response to the attacks.
The police crackdown is the harshest and most violent yet in the
government's continuing fight against the Gama'a al-Islamiyya, the shadowy
Islamic militant group which claims to be behind recent attacks on tourists.
There have been few more violent clashes between police and alleged
extremists since the aftermath of President Sadat's assassination in 1981.
Police have rounded up hundreds, and possibly thousands of alleged Gama'a
al-Islamiyya activists since attacks on tourists began last summer and
clashes between militants and police have been sustained at a low level over
the past several months leaving, by some estimates, 15 dead and 33 wounded
before the last two days' violence.
But yesterday's raids appear to signal a new resolve within the government
to bear down even more heavily on the militant groups, whose attacks on
foreign visitors have devastated the country's tourism industry.
Cancellations are estimated by the government to be costing Dollars 70m
(Pounds 49m) a month.
President Hosni Mubarak said in a recent US newspaper interview that he was
prepared to use a 'very heavy hand' against the Islamic militants. Saying
that he believed their attacks had peaked, he nevertheless told the
Washington Post: 'I'll be very strict with them. I'm very strict with these
people for the sake of the country and the people.'
An Interior Ministry statement yesterday said that the series of raids,
which took place in central, northern and western Cairo, led to several
arrests, including that of two un-named men claimed to be among the 'top
leadership' of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya. The ministry said several guns and
explosives were also seized.

(Pounds 1.2m) bracket, the China News Service quoted a mainland magazine as
saying.
Average per capita income for Chinese rose above 2,000 renminbi for the
first time last year, driven by 12.8 per cent economic growth. A million
renminbi is worth Pounds 120,000 at the official rate.
'The slogan of a few years ago - that some people must get rich before
others - has become a reality but the level of wealth has far exceeded
expectations,' the report added.
It said many mainland Chinese were on waiting lists for China's new golf
courses, with membership fees of Pounds 21,000 to Pounds 28,000

NIGERIA'S petroleum and mineral resources secretary, Mr Philip Asiodu, said

'The government is going to open up many sectors of downstream activities to
if necessary 100 per cent private ownership,' Mr Asiodu said in radio

'We are going to allow people to export and use the proceeds to pay for the
equipment they must import,' he told senior staff of the state-owned
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC) in Lagos.
Mr Asiodu said the government plans to make it easier for private investors
to participate in the oil industry.
'We are going to look at any other administrative procedures which impede
decisions of well meaning investors,' he said.
Nigeria's downstream oil sector is at present dominated by major western oil
companies operating as minority joint venture partners of the NNPC.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Falling competitiveness in Japan worries Miti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's powerful Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti)
believes important parts of Japanese industry have lost their international
competitiveness.
The ministry, widely regarded in the west as the architect of the country's
industrial success, believes significant parts of Japanese industry will
need far-reaching restructuring to respond to the protracted slump in the
economy.
Senior Miti officials are drawing up plans for a wide-ranging information
technology investment programme to help revive the economy by upgrading its
telecommunications infrastructure.
They believe the government's plan to stimulate the economy with another
emergency spending package being drawn up now should not be confined to
traditional public works programmes, which mainly benefit the construction
industry and heavy industries such as steel and chemicals.
Miti wants to develop so-called telecommunications data highways
(sophisticated high-speed communications links) which should stimulate
demand for the hard-pressed electronics sector.
A linked Miti plan for schools and universities to use government funds to
buy computers has won the tacit backing of Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime
minister.
The electronics industry and other sectors with chronic overcapacity may
need further restructuring even if a pump-priming programme is introduced,
senior officials believe.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, Japan's vice-minister for international affairs, said:
'In industries such as automobiles and electronics where saturation has
developed, this recession has exposed real problems with Japan's industrial
structure which will need to be addressed.'
Mr Hatakeyama said he would not be surprised if more companies followed the
recent lead of Nissan, which shocked the automobile industry by announcing
plans to close its Zama production plant.
He said too many Japanese companies had been lax during the high growth in
the late 1980s and had let their costs grow out of control.
There were particular concerns about Japan's position in some key areas of
electronics, such as microprocessors and computer work stations, where
Japanese industry was losing its competitiveness, Mr Hatakeyama said.
In the past few months Japanese personal computer manufacturers faced a
mounting challenge in their domestic market from US producers such as
Compaq, while many Japanese semiconductor makers acknowledge US competition
has become tougher.
Mr Hatakeyama said research and development in the electronics industry was
a candidate for special attention from Miti programmes.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Kenya devalues official rate: Move to win back aid from
foreign donors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE, Africa Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kenya government intensified its economic reform drive yesterday
devaluing its official exchange rate in a bid to win back foreign aid from
donors who meet in London next week.
The central bank announced a 20 per cent devaluation of the official rate -
used solely for government imports and servicing public and publicly
guaranteed debt - from 36.4 to 45.6 shillings to the US dollar.
The commercial rate of exchange, set by the banking sector for all other
trade, is hovering around Sh60 to the dollar.
The move is a further concession to the International Monetary Fund and
removes an obstacle to speedy resumption of crucial quick disbursing aid
worth up to Dollars 40m (Pounds 28m) a month, suspended in 1991 because of
economic mismanagement.
The IMF left Kenya last weekend without agreeing a provisional deal which
could lead to the resumption of the frozen aid. The Fund was reported to
have insisted on a staggered merging of the official and commercial exchange
rates before giving its stamp of approval to the government's reform
programme.
Money supply grew last year 35 per cent and inflation is between 40 and 60
per cent.
After months of delay the government embarked on a serious programme of
reforms in mid-February. It floated the currency for commercial
transactions, announced tighter expenditure controls and took steps to
restart the liberal-isation of the agricultural sector.
Next Monday the World Bank will chair an informal donors' meeting in London
to review the recent measures and discuss the possibility of resuming the
suspended aid. Among proposals to be discussed is the rapid unblocking of a
World Bank export promotion loan worth Dollars 150m in World Bank and
bilateral funds.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Asia-Pacific consumers help Singapore turn up volume:
Insatiable demand for electronics goods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MILIVOJ von Somogy, head of Asia-Pacific operations for European
electronics giant SGS-Thomson, has a problem. He cannot produce enough goods
to satisfy demand.
SGS-Thomson produces about 100m pieces of various computer chips each month
at its plants in Singapore. Mr Somogy says the company's semiconductor sales
in the Asia-Pacific region grew by 33 per cent last year.
'In the Singapore/Malaysia area our sales now exceed those of either France
or Britain and are the same as those of Germany. . . it's no longer a
question of orders. Instead it's a question of whether we can supply fast
enough.'
The SGS-Thomson experience is shared by several other companies based in
Singapore and elsewhere in the region.
Regional demand for a whole range of goods is soaring while in much of the
rest of the world it is stagnating or declining. More and more
multinationals are realising that it is vital to have a manufacturing base
in the world's fastest growing region.
At first foreign electronics companies invested in Singapore because of
cheap labour. Times have changed. Companies that in the 1960s were
assembling black and white television sets have evolved to design and
manufacture a comprehensive range of final products, sub-assemblies,
components and parts for both industrial and consumer electronics
industries.
More than 250 electronics companies in Singapore produced an estimated
SDollars 31bn (Pounds 13bn) worth of goods last year, 6 per cent up on 1991.
Products cover almost the entire electronics sector: Singapore now accounts
for about 50 per cent of total world output of computer disk drives.
At a time of serious investment shortfalls elsewhere, investment commitments
in Singapore's manufacturing sector reached a record high of SDollars 3.5bn
in 1992 - 21 per cent up on 1991. Of that, SDollars 1.4bn, more than 40 per
cent of the total, is being invested in the electronics sector.
Electronics companies invest in Singapore because of its industrial
infrastructure and its well established expertise in the industry. The city
state is also at the centre of an increasingly regionalised industry.
SGS-Thomson has 1,500 people there producing increasingly sophisticated
'front end' products. Another 3,200 are employed in 'back end' operations in
Malaysia. The island of Penang in Malaysia is becoming an important
electronics manufacturing centre. Parts made there or in Thailand are
shipped to Singapore for finishing.
Nike, the US running shoes manufacturer, tied up its laces and moved its
manufacturing operations across the Pacific some time ago. Of the 90m pairs
of shoes Nike produces each year, less than 2 per cent are made outside
Asia.
Du Pont is one of several chemical companies making multi-million dollar
investments in new plant in Singapore. One of the Du Pont plants will
produce key ingredients for polyurethane used, among other things, for
liners in the running shoes industry. In future, Du Pont will able to feed
Nike plants in Indonesia and elsewhere in the region from its Singapore
plant, rather than from the US.
'We've been selling our products in this region for many years,' says Mr
Thomas Springer, managing director of Du Pont's Singapore operations. 'Now
having a presence here makes sense both from a production and sales point of
view. Over the next few years we see our market in the Asia Pacific growing
at twice the rate of anywhere else.'
Eastman Chemical of the US, which has recently opened a regional
headquarters in Singapore and is looking at investments in the area, says
Asia will remain the world's fastest growing consumer market for some years.
'It's here, in the Asia Pacific, that we can see our future,' says Mr
Earnest Deavenport, Eastman's president.
An increasingly affluent middle class is fuelling consumer spending in the
region, greatly increasing demand for everything from electronic equipment
to goods derived from the petrochemicals industry.
Singapore's planners expect that the country's - and the region's -
dependence on traditional export markets in the US and Europe will diminish
as demand rises closer to home. The newly opened economies of India and
China are being targeted as the main new growth areas.
Companies such as SGS-Thomson see the changes reflected in sales figures.
'In terms of sales, our semiconductor market in the Asia-Pacific has caught
up with Europe,' says Mr Somogy. 'China is opening up and presents a
tremendous market. I don't see much change in the growth trend in this
region for the next 10 to 15 years.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Pressure on UK to alter system for EC elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European parliament yesterday approved proposals for a uniform electoral
system, stepping up pressure on the UK to accept a form of proportional
representation in elections to the EC body.
The UK, which has fought for 10 years against proportional representation to
the parliament, seems certain to exercise a veto.
Under the Maastricht treaty the 12 member states must approve the measures
unanimously in the council of ministers.
The proposals approved in Strasbourg yesterday were a carefully crafted
compromise aimed at accommodating British objections so that at least
partial proportional representation could be introduced in time for the 1994
elections.
According to the resolutions approved, the UK would be able to retain at
least two-thirds of seats under its present 'first-past-the-post' electoral
system. The remaining one-third would be elected using national or regional
lists of candidates.
A separate measure allows member states to introduce a minimum 3-5 per cent
threshold which parties must cross to gain seats in Strasbourg. The minimum
hurdle is designed, as in Germany, to prevent the rise of extremist parties.
MEPs also approved a clause allowing special arrangements to ensure
representation by regional parties such as the Scottish and Welsh
nationalists - provided they do not violate the principle of proportional
representation.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Telecom liberalisation debate reopens in EC: Brussels
proposals, along with German privatisation talks, bring competition issue to
the fore

<TEXT>
DEBATES taking place over the future of telecommunications monopolies in a
number of European Community countries are likely to be heightened by a plan
under consideration at the EC Commission which would liberalise the market
for all domestic and international telephone calls.
Talks on the privatisation of Deutsche Telekom, the German state telephone
monopoly, reopen today between Germany's coalition government and the
opposition. Deutsche Telekom yesterday welcomed 'the competition promoted by
the European Community as long as all companies in the sector face equal and
fair conditions for competition'.
The company has argued that privatisation is the only way to ensure it can
compete globally and has urged the Bonn government to push it through as
rapidly as possible.
The government will today present an eight point document which plans to
turn Deutsche Telekom into a shareholder company and sell part of its
equity. The document also foresees that a monopoly will be maintained for
the next five years and possibly an additional three years.
But a fierce discussion is expected between the government and the
opposition Social Democrats who oppose outright privatisation. The agreement
of the opposition is needed in order to change the constitution and allow
privatisation to go ahead.
The European Commission will meanwhile finish nearly six months of
consultations with the industry, consumers, regulators and member states at
the end of this month.
According to senior Brussels telecoms officials, the mood of the industry is
gradually changing towards opening all domestic and international telephone
calls to competition, albeit in a number of phases introduced over a period
as long as 10 years.
The highly sensitive decision on whether to press for full liberalisation
and harmonisation of 'voice telephony' in the EC will be up to the 17
commissioners, prompted by Mr Martin Bangemann, EC commissioner for industry
and telecommunications, and Mr Karel Van Miert, responsible for competition.
A report approved by the Commission in October laid out four options for the
next wave of legislation, ranging from doing nothing to full liberalisation.
At that stage, commissioners favoured a cautious approach, opening
cross-border calls within the EC to competition as a first step.
If the Commission chooses a more ambitious programme, culminating in open
competition across the whole European network, it will set the scene for a
fierce political debate between member states on the pace and extent of
liberalisation.
The German negotiations broke down last December with the opposition flatly
rejecting the government plan. But both sides today, led by Mr Wolfgang
Botsch, posts and telecommunications minister since January, and by a new
negotiating team for the Social Democrats, say they are willing to find a
compromise.
The Social Democrats claim a private telecoms monopoly could renege on the
current obligation to service all parts of the country. They have also been
representing the powerful post and telecoms trade union which fears for the
special privileges of its members, who have the job security and pension
rights of civil servants, if privatisation goes through.
They are instead proposing that Deutsche Telekom becomes an Anstalt des
offentlichen Rechts, or public law corporation, a special legal status
enjoyed only by some regional banks and television channels in Germany. Such
a corporation would initially offer non-tradable certificates to private
buyers.
Deutsche Telekom says it urgently needs to expand its capital base through
outright privatisation in order to help finance a DM60bn investment
programme in east Germany.
Whenever the Commission has rolled out new proposals for telecommunications
deregulation in recent years one of the loudest voices of dissent has been
France Telecom, the giant telecommunications group which is arguably the
flagship of France's public sector.
On opening up the market for domestic and international telephone calls,
France Telecom said yesterday that it would wait until it received a clear
indication of the EC's proposals before assessing its own position. However,
it stressed that it considered the question of deregulating the voice
telephony market - which still represents around 80 per cent of the turnover
of most European telecommunications companies - as one of 'great
sensitivity' with 'economic and social implications for the whole industry'.
One of France Telecom's chief concerns is the need to ensure that the
standard of telecommunications networks is sufficiently high across the
Community. A traditional objection to complete deregulation has been the
poor state of the networks in southern Europe.
In Spain, the chief obstacle to rapid liberalisation of telecommunications,
especially voice traffic, is government reluctance to allow domestic call
charges to rise rapidly. Domestic telephone charges are low and are
subsidised by expensive trunk charges and other service tariffs.
The government is allowing the operating monopoly, Telefonica, slowly to
correct its tariff imbalances but insists that the increase must remain just
below inflation.
Telefonica has, at least in theory, reconciled itself to a totally
liberalised market. A company official says: 'There is no point opposing
liberalisation. It is just a question of time until the Bundespost starts
offering services to big German companies in Spain.' The Spanish company is
already starting to explore opportunities in Portugal and the UK.
Italy's position is coloured by the need to restructure the telecoms sector.
Currently spread among a number of companies and state agencies,
telecommunications come under the umbrella of Stet, itself controlled by the
IRI state holding group.
Stet would have no objection to full competition, subject to the proviso
that all the major European utilities first agree on co-ordinating their
tariffs. Subsequently, charges could diverge, based on competitiveness and
efficiency.

FT  11 MAR 93 / E Europe more attractive: Hungary and Czech Republic top

WESTERN business executives rate Hungary and the Czech Republic as the best
places for business in eastern Europe, according to a new poll.
Some 48 per cent of executives interviewed in a survey by American Express
said the business environment in Hungary was good or excellent and 43 per
cent said the same of the Czech Republic.
Budapest, where reforms towards a market economy and modernisation started
first, led the pack in telecommunications, basic utilities, labour quality
and trade regulations. Prague, which has a longer business tradition,
followed close behind in most categories and led in terms of financial
regulations.
However the survey found that it was Poland's economic stability which had
improved the most, with 41 per cent rating the country positive compared
with only 3 per cent in 1990. That finding contrasted sharply with the view
that economic stability in Moscow had deteriorated. A full 62 per cent rated
the business environment in Russia as poor.
The survey, which covered 126 leading executives of companies with links
with eastern Europe, coincides with other indications of the countries'
relative popularity.
A multi-million dollar facility to stimulate tourism in central and eastern
Europe is being launched this week by the European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development, in collaboration with the World Travel and Tourism Council,
writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor.
Travel and tourism in the region have been badly hit lately. Earnings fell
more than 8 per cent between 1989 and 1990, the last year for which the WTTC
has data.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Exports key for Norway

<TEXT>
NORWAY'S fragile economy is expected to strengthen in 1993 and 1994, helped
by increased exports. But improvement depends on revived world commodity
markets, enhanced cost-competitiveness and low wage claims, according to the
annual report on the country by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation
and Development.
The OECD warned that without improved market conditions for commodity prices
the expected increase in Norwegian exports would be at risk.
Improved export performance 'will only materialise if competitive gains are
not offset by higher wage gains. The still fragile domestic financial
situation might also hamper the pick-up of activity, as a further
deterioration in banks' balance sheets or failure to restore bank
profitability could aggravate the difficulties in financing new
investments,' the OECD said.
Mainland gross domestic product growth, excluding petroleum and shipping,
will expand nearly 2 per cent this year and exceed 3 per cent in 1994, the
OECD said. Overall GDP growth is forecast to rise 3.8 per cent in 1994,
after a 1.3 per cent gain in 1993.
Improved business investment prospects should also contribute to an upswing
in economic activity with continued expansion of petroleum production
helping to maintain a large external surplus.
Norway, the world's tenth largest oil producer with current daily crude oil
output of 2.3m barrels, will see petroleum production grow at an annual rate
of 6 per cent in 1994, the OECD forecast. The organisation said that
Norway's oil-adjusted budget deficit appears now much larger than can be
covered by net oil revenues on an ongoing basis.
On Norway's banking crisis, the OECD said further reform of the financial
system is necessary to restore a healthy and competitive domestic banking
industry. Following five years of massive losses, Norway's top three banks
have become state-owned.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Czech government plans to sell companies and property worth CzK500bn
(Pounds 12.1bn) in a second wave of disposals of state assets from next
autumn, the privatisation ministry confirmed yesterday.
More than 2,100 companies are earmarked for privatisation, though more may
be added to the list until the March 15 deadline for approval by the
ministry. Sectors affected by the programme include industry, agriculture,
housing, services and health care.
Candidate companies include names such as Budvar (beer), and Crystalex (fine
glass) as well as Kotva, Prague's leading department store. Cesky Plinarsky
Podnik, the Czech gas distribution and transport company, Chemopetro and
Kausuk (oil refineries), and Zetor, the tractor manufacturer from Brno are
also included, as are several steel companies.
About 30 per cent of the value of assets to be privatised will be sold by
issuing vouchers to the public that can later be used to bid for shares. The
remainder will be sold through direct negotiations with potential investors,
by public tender or auctions.
The first wave of privatisation was completed last December before the
break-up of the former Czechoslovakia into separate Czech and Slovak states
on January 1. This transferred assets worth CzK630bn to the private sector.
About 1,500 companies were privatised by vouchers alone.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Swiss women in rare triumph
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WOMEN scored a rare triumph over Swiss male chauvinism yesterday when Ms
Ruth Dreifuss became only the second woman to be elected to the seven-member
federal cabinet.
It took considerable backroom intrigue, angry demonstrations by women
throughout the country and ultimately three rounds of balloting among the
mainly male federal parliamentarians before the little known Ms Dreifuss
emerged a victor.
And in the end no one was happy. 'It is a typical Swiss compromise, with no
winners or losers,' one parliamentarian said.
The trouble began in January when Mr Rene Felber, the foreign minister,
resigned from the cabinet. As Mr Felber was a member of the Democratic
Socialist party and a French Swiss, the 'magic formula' agreed by the four
parties in the coalition government required that his replacement also be a
French Swiss socialist.
The socialists quickly discovered that Ms Christiane Brunner, a trade union
leader, was one of only two to meet the requirements. Making a virtue out of
near necessity, they championed her, saying it was high time a woman was in
the cabinet.
The liberal and conservative parties in the coalition disagreed, at least as
far as Ms Brunner was concerned. Her dress was too casual, her private life
unorthodox, they complained. Worse, she had once supported a proposal to
abolish the Swiss army.
Give us a choice, they demanded, but the socialists refused. When it came to
the vote a week ago, they rejected Ms Brunner, electing a French speaking
socialist man, Mr Francis Matthey, instead.
For the socialists, this was unacceptable. They ordered Mr Matthey not to
accept his election, and threatened to leave the coalition, a move that some
of their conservative partners secretly hoped for.
Instead, they turned the tables, proposing Ms Dreifuss, a trade union leader
with views virtually identical to those of Ms Brunner.
The liberals and conservatives fumed and squirmed, but obviously influenced
by the wave of protest against their shoddy treatment of Ms Brunner, most
reluctantly fell into line.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Milan election to test opinion after corruption probes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S first big test of public opinion since revelations of widespread
political corruption gathered pace this year has dawned with the prospect of
elections in Milan, its second biggest city.
The move follows the decision by the majority of councillors to resign on
Tuesday night following widening rifts within the coalition administration
and the arrest of one member following investigations into kickbacks. The
Milan poll, which may be held in June, could offer the first big test of
public support for the parties before widely expected general elections
later in the year.
Coming in the city where magistrates first stumbled on the trial of what has
become a national corruption scandal, the vote will put all the main parties
to the test.
It would indicate the level of support for the discredited Socialists, whose
former leader, Mr Bettino Craxi, based his power in Milan. Early elections
could also prove an important challenge to the autonomist Lombard League,
which captured about a third of the vote in nearby Varese last December.
Securing the mayorship of Milan would be a big prestige boost for its
leader, Mr Umberto Bossi, who is thought to have set his sights on control
of the former Socialist fastness. The collapse of Milan's administration
after weeks of agony follows growing political problems in Rome, Turin and
Naples, where the mayors have stepped down and attempts are under way to
form new coalitions. However, Milan is the first case where councillors have
opted for elections, rather than using the statutory 60-day period to form a
new administration.
The resignation of the council coincided with a decision, yet to be
formalised, to drop Milan's bid to host the Olympic Games in 2000. Although
never a front runner, officials had until recently insisted Milan would
press ahead with its bid despite the growing political scandals. Italy's
Olympic committee may consider re-bidding for the Games in 2004.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Socialist lieutenants await electoral fate: The sheer scale
of the shift in political sentiment will mean a shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO SOONER had Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister,
arrived at a Cambodian social evening in his Val d'Oise constituency last
week than Mr Pierre Lellouche, his conservative opponent in this month's
parliamentary elections, walked into the room.
A photographer started taking pictures. The minister ordered him to hand
over his film. The photographer refused.
For Mr Strauss-Kahn, 43, this was only one of a string of humiliations in
the current electoral campaign. Mr Lellouche, 42, a foreign affairs adviser
to Mr Jacques Chirac, conservative mayor of Paris, has steadily been gaining
ground. This week's polls suggest he will win the seat thereby depriving Mr
Strauss-Kahn of his place in parliament.
If he loses, Mr Strauss-Kahn would at least be in good company. Several
prominent socialists risk defeat in this month's vote. Mr Michel Rocard, 62,
former French prime minister and the architect of the 'big bang'
post-electoral alliance with the ecologists, is in danger of losing his seat
at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine near Paris, as is Mr Roland Dumas, 70, the
influential foreign minister, at Sarlat in the Dordogne. Mr Georges
Marchais, 72, the veteran communist leader, may forfeit the seat he has held
for 20 years in Val-de-Marne.
The chief cause of this shake-up is the sheer scale of the shift in
political sentiment since the last legislative elections in 1988.
The socialists now command the support of just 22 per cent of the
electorate, according to the latest Sofres poll for Le Nouvel Observateur,
against 38 per cent for the conservative RPR and UDF coalition.
This means the socialists stand to lose more than half of their 270 seats in
the National Assembly.
However, the threat to Mr Strauss-Kahn, Mr Rocard, Mr Dumas and Mr Marchais
is not simply the result of a swing from left to right.
It is also the legacy of longer term structural changes in French politics -
disaffection from the political establishment and the rise of new movements,
notably environmentalism.
Mr Strauss-Kahn's constituency in Val d'Oise, a 1950s new town which was
expanded in the early 1960s to house the pieds noirs, the immigrants then
fleeing to France from North Africa, looks like a classic socialist
stronghold with its litany of social problems. Those problems have escalated
as areas like Sarcelles, the urban hellhole within the constituency, have
borne the brunt of the recent surges in unemployment, crime, drugs abuse and
racial tension.
Mr Strauss-Kahn, a former academic married to Ms Anne Sinclair, doyenne of
France's television presenters, has appeared increasingly remote from his
constituents as he has pursued his ambitions in the industry ministry.
Mr Lellouche has been swift to exploit this scenario and to paint the ruling
socialists as the cause of Sarcelles' problems, rather than in their old
role as a source of solutions. The latest CSA poll for Le Parisien suggests
Mr Lellouche will win the final vote on March 28 with 52 per cent, against
48 per cent for Mr Strauss-Kahn.
Down in the Dordogne, Mr Dumas is also struggling against a strong
conservative candidate.
Mr Jean-Jacques de Peretti, the Gaullist mayor, has, like Mr Lellouche,
profited from the socialists' plunging popularity. He has also benefited
from the recent scandal over Mr Dumas's friendship with Ms Nahed Ojjeh,
daughter of Mr Mustapha Tlass, the Syrian defence minister, and the
revelation that her family foundation paid for a new Pounds 1m scanner in a
Sarlat hos-pital.
One of the few consolations for Mr Dumas and Mr Strauss-Kahn is that their
campaigns are, at least, straightforward battles between left and right. Mr
Rocard and Mr Marchais are not so fortunate.
Their different electoral strategies have been complicated by the emergence
of the ecologists as a third force in French politics and as a protest vote
against the traditional left.
There are two rounds of voting in French legislative elections. Candidates
qualify for the second round if they win 12.5 per cent of the first vote. Mr
Rocard and Mr Marchais are in constituencies where both the ecologist and
conservative candidates are expected to join them in a three-way fight for
the second round. Mr Marchais, who has presided over the fading fortunes of
the French communists since 1972, risks being beaten in the second round by
Mr Alan Lipietz, the ecologist, according to CSA.
Mr Rocard's problem is that Ms Monique Le Saux, the ecologist candidate who
is his former parliamentary adviser, stands to win 17 per cent of the second
round.
This means that the former prime minister's support would fall to 37 per
cent, thereby allowing Mr Pierre Cardo, the conservative, to win the
constituency with 47 per cent.
Such a defeat could damage, but not destroy, Mr Rocard's chances in the 1995
presidential elections and would also dent the credibility of his call for a
socialist coalition with the ecologists, although Ms Le Saux could, of
course, be persuaded to stand down in the second round.
In the meantime Mr Rocard seems remarkably sanguine. 'This is my 14th
campaign,' he said this week. 'It's all rather routine.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Assemble Nationale, Election '93: Mitterrand in 'jobs for
the boys' row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Mitterrand yesterday came under a barrage of opposition criticism
for using the civil and diplomatic service to find jobs for Socialists
facing defeat in this month's parliamentary election.
Mr Pierre Joxe, defence minister, was yesterday nominated president of the
Cour des Comptes, the body which vets public spending. Responsibility for
the defence ministry was assigned to Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy. Le
Figaro newspaper quoted a military officer as suggesting the opposition
should take over the defence ministry immediately, in anticipation of its
inevitable victory in the two rounds of voting on March 21 and 28.
Mr Alain Juppe, secretary general of the RPR gaullists, said it was shocking
to see a defence minister abandon his post when 14,000 French soldiers were
out on often-risky operations. The RPR leader complained that every morning
was bringing news of Socialists being 'stuffed into diplomatic jobs,
prefectures, central and local government'. From the left, a communist
deputy commented wryly that by taking care of his 'chums', the president
wanted to make sure that he was not adding to unemployment.
Elysee officials countered that Mr Joxe had started his career in the Cour
des Comptes, was not standing for election and that the timing of his
appointment had been dictated by the previous financial controller reaching
statutory retirement age this week.
Amid all the campaign-trail accusations, however, it is clear that President
Mitterrand is getting ready to exercise his constitutional right to run
foreign policy, in anticipation of a RPR-UDF centre-right victory.
Both the Elysee and the foreign ministry yesterday flatly rejected
opposition allegations that Socialist sympathisers were being favoured in
the reassignment of some 30 ambassadors since the start of the year. All
those appointed are career diplomats, they pointed out, though it was
admitted that those who have substantially made their careers during two
five-year stints (1981-86 and 1988-93) of Socialist government may be
seizing new posts for fear of being victimised by the incoming
administration.
The Elysee also denied allegations that a new computer system hooking the
presidential staff into the foreign ministry's diplomatic cable traffic is
designed to enable Mr Mitterrand to bypass a future conservative foreign
minister by issuing his own instructions direct to France's embassies
abroad. Elysee officials said that the system was planned two years ago and
is just designed to keep the president informed.
But there are strong rumours that Mr Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, may
go to the Elysee as foreign policy adviser if he is defeated in his
parliamentary seat. Mr Juppe warned that, just as in 1986-88 when the
centre-right governed, foreign policy would be 'the most difficult element
of the cohabitation' with the president.
The RPR leader indicated that the incoming conservatives might want to be
even more protectionist towards the outside world than the Socialist
government. There was, he said, a growing consensus in France that the rules
of international trade needed to be changed. Inside the EC, it was fruitless
to alter Britain's pro-free trade stance which, he said, had been
'catastrophic' for that country, but France had 'political cards' to play in
influencing Germany. Paris, for instance, could support giving Germany a
permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.
From the other end of the political spectrum yesterday came a denunciation
of Gatt and British social policy from the 'quadras' group of Socialist
ministers and deputies in their forties. They effectively backed Mr Michel
Rocard's call for a 'big bang' reorganisation of the French left.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Bosnian Moslems split on peace map
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Moslem-led Bosnian leadership yesterday remained divided over whether to
support the Vance-Owen peace plan dividing Bosnia into 10 semi-autonomous
provinces.
President Alija Izetbegovic, who was due to fly back to New York at the end
of this week to give his government's reply to the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance
and Lord Owen, is now expected to delay his return until next week.
In the meantime, Mr Vance and Lord Owen are to have talks in Paris today
with Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian president, in an attempt to persuade
him to put pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept their peace plan.
Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, said there
were certain points in the plan on which the Moslems could not make further
concessions.
The ambassador indicated that, at a meeting of the collective Bosnian
leadership in Sarajevo yesterday, there was a feeling that ethnicity
remained the predominant criterion of the peace plan.
'I think the president is convinced that he cannot sell this plan without
some critical, but not necessarily major, changes,' Mr Sacirbey said.
Bosnian Serb leader Mr Radovan Karadzic says the whole question of maps must
be looked at again.
In a letter to the Daily Telegraph today, he warns against any attempt to
isolate the Bosnian-Serb leadership to force acceptance of all aspects of
the Vance-Owen map, which would divide the republic into ethnic enclaves.'
The reality of my position and that of my government is that we are faced
with a daily task of convincing the Bosnian-Serb civilian population that
they can ultimately gain from a negotiated settlement,' he says.

FT  11 MAR 93 / IMF tries to shore up Russian reformers: Renewed efforts
under way to agree debt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund is stepping up efforts to get an agreement
with the Russian government in an attempt to show support for the embattled
economic reformers, according to Mr Alexander Shokhin, deputy prime minister
in charge of foreign economic relations.
Mr Shokhin is also more hopeful of an agreement with western creditors on
repayments of the outstanding Dollars 80bn (Pounds 56bn) of former Soviet
debt. He said this would mean Russia would pay between Dollars 2.5bn and
Dollars 6bn this year. In total Russia should pay back Dollars 40bn to Paris
Club of creditor countries in 1993.
Mr Shokhin said that Mr Michel Camdessus, the IMF managing director, had
said in talks last week in Washington that he would like an agreement to be
signed by April.
'Of course, before such an agreement we must put in place strict financial
controls. The proposed agreement put to the Congress of People's Deputies by
the president is mainly about allowing the government freedom to realise its
economic policies. If they do not agree, we will try to find another way
out, but of course it will be more difficult,' he said.
The chances of the Congress agreeing to allow the government to pursue
economic reform are remote. The smaller Supreme Soviet has already rejected
the proposal.
The IMF has already broadly approved a revised plan drawn up by Mr Boris
Fyodorov, the deputy premier in charge of the economy and finance, which
would rein back credits and select those industrial sectors which would be
supported.
After more than a year's work with the Russian government, the Fund is
extremely conscious of the difficulties the Russian government has in
finding enough political support in the country for harsh economic measures.
Mr Camdessus, who has given a high priority to the Russian reform, is also
anxious to safeguard the IMF's role in the former Soviet states.
There has been growing feeling among G7 states that prime responsibility for
economic assistance to Russia should be given to a committee drawn from the
G7, which would judge the injection of aid on political rather than strictly
economic grounds.
Members of the G7, most notably France, Germany and the US, have begun to
show growing concern about developments in Russia. President Bill Clinton
has called for a G7 meeting to deal with aid to Russia as soon as possible
and is due to meet President Yeltsin in Vancouver on April 4.
Mr Shokhin also believes that a debt deal with Ukraine is imminent. He
believes the Ukrainian government is ready to agree to a division of the
former Soviet debt after months of haggling over the terms.
A meeting of the heads of the governments of the Commonwealth of Independent
States is set for tomorrow in Moscow. Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian
premier, is expected to try to conclude an agreement with Mr Shokhin on how
the debt - and the foreign property of the former Soviet Union - is to be
shared between the two Slav states.
Mr Shokhin said that an agreement with the IMF would be 'very important' in
finally reaching a debt agreement with the Paris Club. The club usually
requires this before it defers debt repayments.
'Debt restructuring is now the most important part of western aid to Russia.
If we get agreement on it, grain and other credit lines could again be open
to us.'

FT  11 MAR 93 / Kohl's idea of solidarity may decide the future of
federalism: The only point of agreement between the Bonn government and the
opposition is that a deal must be done
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE figures are huge, and they never seem quite to add up. The debate is
tempestuous, but above all confused. The positions seem thoroughly
entrenched, and the differences between the negotiators enormous.
The only thing that everyone seems to agree on is that a deal must be done,
and urgently. The stage is thus set for today's opening of a two-day, or
possibly three-day closed-door conference between Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
the 16 prime minister's of Germany's federal states.
The negotiators hope to agree a 'solidarity pact' for east Germany: a deal
between the federal government, the 16 Lander, the opposition Social
Democrats, and - somewhere hovering in the wings - the business community
and the unions, on future financing of the soaring cost of unification.
Many notable politicians believe it will decide the future of federalism in
Germany.
A clear outcome will counter the growing mood of gloom in the German
economy. However, failure to reach agreement will compound the sense of
political drift which is reinforcing the current recession.
The reason the issue is so complex is that it seeks not only to finance the
huge cash transfers needed (around DM150bn (Pounds 63.5bn) a year from west
to east) to revive the collapsed east German economy, but also to integrate
the eastern states into the overall system which shares out tax revenues
between central, state and local government in the west.
The debate is therefore not simply about how much cash the eastern Lander
need, but far more about who will pay for it.
It is a question of the Bund (central government), the Lander or, most
probably, the taxpayer.
Can cash for the east be provided by savings in the west, by raising taxes,
or by borrowing? And who will take the blame?
At the heart of the negotiations will be the so-called
Landerfinanzausgleich: the financing 'equalisation' system which divides up
tax revenues and underpins the basic federal relationship between the
central government and the powerful Lander.
They do not have any power to raise taxes, depending on the central
government to do it for them.
The equalisation system first allocates tax revenues between Bonn and the
Lander, and then divides them again to ensure that the poorest areas of the
country do not lose out to the richest.
The main tax where the division is reasonably flexible is value added tax,
currently shared 63 per cent for the Bund, and 37 per cent for the Lander.
The question is who gets what in future.
The system has creaked along ever since the foundation of the Federal
Republic, transferring cash from wealthy states like Bavaria,
Baden-Wurttemberg and Hesse, to the poorer states like the Saarland, Bremen
and Schleswig-Holstein.
The trouble is that the advent of the five new states has brought not only a
vastly increased financial requirement, without a healthy tax base, but also
five much poorer regions into the system.
So the poorest western states look like suddenly losing a big slice of their
previous income, and having to pay more in direct transfers to the east as
well.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has come up with a tax-and-savings
package to bridge the DM110bn financing gap identified for 1995.
He wants DM60bn to transfer directly to the Lander in the east to run their
budgets; DM40bn to service an estimated DM400bn in debts inherited from the
old East Germany and the Treuhand privatisation agency; and DM10bn to
finance continuing industrial restructuring to pay off housing debts and to
maintain subsidies for the poorest states in the west - the city of Bremen
and the Saarland.
Mr Waigel has agreed to pay the full DM40bn debt service from federal funds.
As for the rest, he wants the western states to finance some DM32bn, while
the central government would shoulder the balance - estimated at some
DM38bn. His plan will almost certainly be unpicked over the coming days. It
has caused consternation among the Lander: the easterners say DM60bn is not
enough to keep them going, and the westerners say they cannot afford to pay
anything like DM32bn as their contribution.
In spite of their differences, the Lander have agreed on a strategy: to get
Mr Waigel (the central government) to pay the lion's share. Instead of
getting just 37 per cent of VAT receipts, the states want 45 per cent, an
increase of some DM20bn. Then the eastern states can have the whole
increase, they say.
They will agree to a modest package of spending cuts, while the government
will have to raise taxes to bridge the remaining gap. If they cannot agree
on adequate savings, then the public sector deficit may have to increase a
bit further, the states propose.
It all sounds painful for taxpayers who would be asked to cough up a new
'solidarity surcharge' in the coming months, and for Mr Kohl and Mr Waigel,
who have promised no tax increase before 1995.
Yet if Mr Kohl wants a deal, it may be close to what he will have to accept:
a willingness for the central government to take on most of the DM110bn
burden, and raise income taxes, if not this year, then in 1994. He can
always blame the Lander, and the opposition Social Democrats, when it comes
to the next elections at the end of the year.
For at the end of the day, he knows that an inadequate solidarity pact will
be better than no pact at all.

<TEXT>
URGENT agreement on the planned solidarity pact to finance the future cost
of German unification is needed in the coming days, to prevent a worsening
of the economic recession, Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the German economy minister,
urged yesterday.
In spite of continuing deep differences between the German government and
opposition, and between the central government and the 16 federal states, on
ways of financing the cost of unification, he expressed confidence that a
deal on the pact was close.
In an interview with the Financial Times, Mr Rexrodt said that such an
agreement would be a 'great breakthrough', amounting to a major reform of
public finances, and a long-term guarantee of the cash transfers needed to
finance economic recovery in east Germany.
Speaking on the eve of a two-day closed-doors conference between Chancellor
Helmut Kohl and the 16 premiers of the federal states, as well as the
leaders of the main parliamentary parties, Mr Rexrodt said he believed the
political conditions were right for a deal.
'People have started to say they don't care about the details, whether it
means a 13 pfennig increase in petrol tax, or an 18 pfennig increase. They
have had enough talking, and they want a solution. That makes me hopeful,'
he said.
Speaking in the German Bundestag earlier, Mr Rexrodt said international
financial markets were expecting an agreement, and it was essential to avoid
a further slide into recession.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister and principal architect of the
government's package of social spending cuts and cancelled tax breaks
intended to finance increased spending in the east, rejected calls from the
opposition Social Democrats for an early tax rise.
He insisted the federal government and the 16 states must share the burden
of financing unification, rather than switch almost the entire burden onto
the central exchequer.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, leader of the SPD in the parliament, restated the
demand of the opposition that a solidarity surcharge on income tax should be
reintroduced in July to meet the financing gap, and flatly rejected any move
to cut social spending.

FT  11 MAR 93 / UK wants G7 to aid Moscow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday stepped up the pressure for an early meeting of officials
from the seven leading industrialised countries to see what help the Group
of Seven nations can give Russia in its efforts to implement economic
reform.
After his meeting with President Mitterrand of France on Tuesday, President
Clinton said G7 should 'mobilise' to offer help in Russia's economic
reforms.
British officials are in contact with their counterparts to try to arrange a
meeting of senior officials or of ministers well before the G7 summit in
Tokyo in July.
They believe that a meeting at that level is preferable to one involving
heads of government, where the outcome might be presentational rather than
real.
The fresh British efforts follow Prime Minister John Major's meeting with
President Clinton last month, at which the two leaders agreed that G7 should
become more actively engaged.
British officials said that the worry about Russia, and in particular about
the position of President Yeltsin, was reflected in the fact that it
featured so high up the agenda when time for discussion was so limited.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Yeltsin faced with threat of figurehead presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian Congress of People's Deputies yesterday agreed a draft
resolution to be debated today which would confine President Boris Yeltsin
to a largely ceremonial office.
Mr Yeltsin, who sat through the noisy emergency session of the congress, was
prevented from speaking. But he told reporters as he left he intended to
speak today, and would again demand a referendum on the division of powers.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, set the tone of the
Congress in an opening address which deplored the continuing efforts to push
through radical reforms in the absence of any sign of economic revival. He
accused Mr Yeltsin's government of 'artificial and cynical moves to
destabilise the situation and even involve the army and the interior and
security forces in politics'.
The climax of a day of bitter debate was the production of two contradictory
draft resolutions, one produced by the leadership of the Congress, the other
by the president. The first, approved by the Congress's drafting commission
late yesterday, says that the parliament should 'draft proposals on giving
the president the status of a head of state'.
The ambiguous phrasing appears to mean that he would be a figurehead
president on the German model, deprived of the right to choose a government
or issue decrees. At the same time, the parliament must 'decide in more
detail the powers of the Council of Ministers as a body of executive power'
 -an apparent invitation to parliament to control the government.
The referendum on the division of powers, agreed to by the Seventh Congress
in December, would be cancelled and any future such referendum made
impossible. Articles of the constitution frozen in December - including one
under which the president could be forced to resign by the parliament if he
performed 'unconstitutional acts' - would be reinstated. This resolution was
drawn up after a speech by Mr Nikolai Ryabov, the parliament's first deputy
chairman, which proclaimed that Congress was constitutionally superior to
the president.
However, the Congress's drafting commission rejected Mr Yeltsin's
resolution, a repeat of an earlier motion rejected last week by the smaller
Supreme Soviet, that would free the government to pursue radical economic
changes. It would put the central bank, with state banks and state property
agencies, under government management, but with residual parliamentary
control.
Mr Yeltsin's supporters stormed out of the committee meeting after the
president's resolution was rejected, Itar-Tass news agency said.
In turning down the motion, conservatives appeared to undercut attempts by a
joint commission from the Congress and the presidency to forge a composite
resolution.
Today's session was widely expected to have to choose between two
philosophies of power. Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, Mr Yeltsin's press secretary,
warned last night of a 'potential tragedy' if the Congress continued to
oppose economic reforms.

FT  11 MAR 93 / NatWest's five-week delay on card error
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank admitted yesterday it had waited five weeks after
learning that it had overcharged several thousand credit card customers
before taking action.
The error, which resulted in payments being credited to the wrong accounts
among 15,000 World Wildlife Fund Visa card customers, was discovered in late
January. But NatWest said yesterday an official in its credit card services
unit had decided only to adjust the accounts of individual customers who
noticed a discrepancy and complained.
Only after one customer contacted a more senior manager did the bank decide
to contact and compensate the remaining card holders who were affected.
NatWest has launched an internal investigation and is expected to determine
in a few days whether there will be any disciplinary action.
Mr Trevor Blackler, general manager of UK branch business, said: 'We made a
mistake in how we handled the problem. We are very concerned about giving
good service to our customers and we will be contacting all who are affected
to apologise and put things right.'
The problem occurred after NatWest decided to withdraw its WWF affinity card
in late December and convert the accounts into ordinary Visa cards.
A human error in merging the accounts meant that payments from some WWF card
holders in January were credited to the accounts of other Visa card
customers by mistake. The procedure which led to the error was changed
before February bills were sent out, although the bills themselves were not
corrected.
The bank was able to identify the problem because some of the account
numbers to which funds were channelled did not exist and were rejected by
the computer.
NatWest said 'a significant number' of customers had complained about
inaccurate statements, and their accounts had already been adjusted.
It has now brought in a special team to its credit card unit to identify all
other customers affected and arrange compensation. Any customer who had paid
too much interest because payments had not been credited for January would
be receiving a reimbursement and possibly additional compensation. Customers
who were incorrectly credited with others' payments will have that money
removed but will not be expected to contribute any additional interest they
should have paid.
NatWest last year alerted thousands of cardholders to errors after software
was changed.

FT  11 MAR 93 / Tory MPs signal backing for wider VAT in Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE MPs have signalled that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, has a
free hand to extend value added tax, cut mortgage interest relief and freeze
income tax allowances to narrow the yawning gap in the government's
finances.
But an FT survey reveals that the chancellor is under strong pressure from
the government's supporters at Westminster to balance austerity for
consumers in next Tuesday's Budget with measures to boost industrial
confidence and investment.
A large majority of Tory MPs want him to spread the pain of deficit
reduction by imposing fresh cuts in Whitehall spending plans. Around half
want him to sweeten the pill with a post-Budget cut in interest rates.
The survey suggests that while any increase in income tax rates would risk a
backbench revolt, the Tory party is ready to accept a wide range of other
measures to boost the Treasury's revenues.
A favourable reception to the Budget from its own side will be critical if
the government is to begin to restore its battered authority after this
week's defeat on the Maastricht treaty. The row over Europe has left the
government's control over its own supporters weaker than at any time since
the 1970s.
The FT survey, based on written replies from 85 Tory MPs, representing a
third of the government's backbench strength, underlines also the Budget's
crucial importance for Mr Lamont's own reputation. Nearly two-thirds judge
his performance as chancellor as 'fair' or 'disappointing'. Only 6 per cent
say he has done an 'excellent' job.
The survey coincides with a hardening of opinion within the cabinet in
favour of immediate action to reduce the deficit. Mr Douglas Hurd, Mr
Michael Heseltine, Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr John MacGregor are among senior
ministers supporting a package of tax increases.
Mr Lamont, however, can draw comfort from a widespread recognition among
Conservatives at Westminster that next week's Budget will foreshadow tough
measures to reduce the public sector deficit.
Promoting the recovery, helping industry and tackling unemployment are cited
by an overwhelming majority as the main priority for the Budget package. But
most judge also that the chancellor must get to grips with the borrowing
requirement.
Some 56 per cent of Tory MPs favour higher taxes, with more than half of
those seeking immediate action.
The deficit is deemed sufficiently threatening by 30 per cent for them to
call for tax increases both next week and in the November Budget.
Among the key results of the survey are:
Mortgage interest relief, once sacrosanct, is regarded by 53 per cent as a
target for savings. Nearly two-thirds of Tory MPs want a fresh round of
public spending cuts.
Nine-tenths want special measures to help industry and promote investment.

FT  11 MAR 93 / City may scrap trading scheme: Stock Exchange board asked to
cancel Taurus computer project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of the London Stock Exchange will today be asked to abandon a
computer project which has already cost the City as much as Pounds 400m and
which is widely seen as central to the future competitiveness of London's
financial markets.
Mr Peter Rawlins, the exchange's chief executive, will tell the board that
the paperless settlement system, Taurus, is technically too complex to
complete without further heavy spending and should be abandoned.
The system, first proposed in the early 1980s, was intended to automate the
transfer of share ownership, replacing the current paper-based system which
is centred around share certificates and transfer forms.
A decision to scrap Taurus would put the London market further behind other
financial centres, most of which have been investing heavily to develop
their own settlement arrangements in recent years.
It would also cause a severe trauma throughout the London securities
industry, which has invested heavily in the project.
The exchange has already spent Pounds 75m itself on the project, with
estimates of spending by others in the securities industry put at up to
Pounds 350m - though much of this may relate to technical developments that
would have taken place even without Taurus.
The proposal to end the project also provoked questions over the future of
the Mr Rawlins, who has been chief executive since 1990. Although the Taurus
project was begun before his appointment, its viability has been reviewed on
several occasions since.
The decision now to call for its abandonment comes two months after some
parts of the system entered full-scale testing.
Mr Rawlins's decision to call for the abandonment of the project has been
prompted by the scale of the technical difficulties which have dogged the
system.
There were early problems experienced in developing parts of the exchange's
own central system which have been followed by fresh difficulties
experienced in testing.
Just two months ago the exchange put back the planned launch of the project
from this autumn until next spring at the earliest.
The exchange refused to confirm the plan to aban-don the project yesterday.
It would only say: 'We have had an urgent review of the project to date, and
the results will be discussed at the board meeting tomorrow.'
News that the exchange may scrap the project provoked anger and concern in
some parts of the City yesterday. 'I don't think they should scrap it,' said
Mr Scott Dobie, a senior executive at NatWest Markets. 'We as an industry
just can't afford to take that step. The credibility loss would be
enormous.'
Mr John Lamb, assistant general manager at National Westminster in charge of
share registration and custody, said: 'If Taurus as we know it is to be
cancelled, there well be a hell of a credibility problem in developing a
replacement.'
But others said the exchange had little choice but to abandon the project or
face further costs which could equal those already incurred.
The head of operations at one large London securities house, who refused to
be named, said: 'What we've done to date is binnable. If you make a mistake,
you have to be prepared to pull the plug.'
A number of board members met chairman Mr Andrew Hugh Smith individually
yesterday to be told of the exchange's plan, and are to decide today whether
to approve it.
Problems that have dogged the project include the legal uncertainty that
surrounded the status of electronic registration; the complexity of linking
a number of independent databases into an effective network; and the
difficulties of ensuring security for a system that controls the ownership
of shares.
Most of the difficulties experienced up to this stage have been overcome.
However, further problems are believed to have emerged since full-scale
testing began.

SHARES in HJ Heinz, the Pittsburgh-based food group, dipped by Dollars 2 1/8
to Dollars 42 3/8 yesterday after the company warned that earnings per share
in the year to end-April would total about Dollars 2.50.
Analysts, guided by the company, had been predicting around Dollars 2.60
until recently.
The company blamed the reduced earnings forecast on 'dramatic currency
fluctuations caused by the withdrawal of the UK and Italy from the (exchange
rate mechanism of the) European Monetary System, sustained marketing
expenditures in certain select markets, and unusually adverse weather
conditions affecting Weight Watchers meeting operations.'
In the previous 12 months, it saw after-tax profits of Dollars 638.3m and
earnings per share of Dollars 2.40.
Profits in 1991-92, however, were lifted by a pre-tax gain of Dollars
221.5m, resulting from the sale of the Hubinger business.
The revised earnings prediction implies a 30 per cent increase in
fourth-quarter earnings per share and would still leave the company's
profits at an all-time high.
It came as Heinz posted after-tax profits of Dollars 162.3m in the third
quarter to January 27, against Dollars 115.3m in the same period of 1991-92.
Sales increased to Dollars 1.77bn from Dollars 1.62bn and earnings per share
rose from 43 to 62 cents.
Heinz attributed the third-quarter improvement to the 9 per cent increase in
sales, of which 3 per cent came from volume gains, 2 per cent from price
increases, and 7 per cent from the acquisition of the Wattie business in New
Zealand; the benefits of a restructuring programme last year; and a reduced
tax rate. The tax charge in the third quarter was Dollars 85m (Dollars
65.8m).
The third-quarter results, however, still leave after-tax profits for the
first nine months of the year down to Dollars 460.3m, from Dollars 492.6m a
year ago. Sales stood at Dollars 5.07bn, compared with Dollars 4.71bn.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander faces new Pounds 8.6m
claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGER &amp; Friedlander, the banking and property group, said yesterday it
faces a new claim for damages of Pounds 8.6m from the department of trade
and industry stemming from Singer's role as adviser to interests connected
with Barlow Clowes, the fraudulent investment group.
The company said the new claim was 'in relation to Singer's role in
connection with Barlow Clowes and the bid for Buckley's Brewery in 1987'.
Last May, Singer disclosed that it and three other City firms faced a
separate claim of Pounds 40m from the DTI.
Singer also announced yesterday that its pre-tax profits fell 61 per cent to
Pounds 6.05m in 1992. However, the fall was attributed to an exceptional
debit of Pounds 10.1m to cover the fall in value of properties held for long
term investment.
Without this debit, pre-tax profits would have risen 5 per cent to Pounds
16.2m.
There was a 33 per cent rise to Pounds 9.29m in trading profits from banking
operations. Mr John Hodson, chief executive, said this was in part
attributable to a 'big turnaround' from losses to profits in a business
which sells the high yielding debt of South American companies.
He added that there was also a strong performance from the corporate finance
department's offices in Leeds and Nottingham, which give advice to small and
medium-size companies. Singer's property division made profits of Pounds
3.05m, down from Pounds 3.12m. The fall was attributable to a rent free
period granted on a new investment, now fully let.
Earnings per share, excluding the exceptional item, rose 22 per cent to
5.86p.
The total dividend was raised from 2.5p to 2.6p via a final of 1.6p.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Union cuts loss to Pounds 16.3m - Boost
from money market and Winterflood sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TURNROUND in its core money market operations and the sale of its equity
marketmaking business for Pounds 19m meant that Union Discount, London's
oldest specialist discount house group, could survive as an independent
company, Mr George Blunden, chief executive, said yesterday.
Announcing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 16.3m, an improvement on the Pounds
23.6m loss the year before, Mr Blunden said Union had succeeded in returning
to break-even at the operating level in the second half. However, the group
is not paying any dividend for the year (13.5p).
Talks about a sale of the group had been called off last week because the
unnamed potential bidder failed to offer enough for Union's troubled leasing
business, Mr Blunden said. The group is now planning to reorganise its
remaining leasing operations, selling some parts and running off the
remainder.
The sale of Union's 90.5 per cent stake in Winterflood Securities, the
specialist smaller companies marketmaker, was intended to provide the
capital to underpin money market operations, allowing it to expand into more
profitable areas of trading such as bond arbitrage.
Winterflood made a profit of Pounds 4.42m for the year, reflecting a return
of interest in smaller companies.
The performance of the group was held back by a loss of about Pounds 3m on
the day sterling pulled out of the European exchange rate mechanism in
September.
Since then the discount house operation had been profitable. Discount house
operating losses for the year were Pounds 5.1m, compared with Pounds 2.6m in
1991.
After higher provisions over leasing in the first half, Union made no
further provisions for the year. Operating losses in asset financing fell
from Pounds 16.3m in 1991 to Pounds 7.6m. If Union fails to find a buyer for
its leasing assets, it could face extra costs of an estimated Pounds 7m over
the next three to four years, said Mr Blunden.
Losses per share, at 78.2p, were down from 98.9p. Net assets per share fell
from 300.63p to 187.92p, though the sale of Winterflood added a further 32p
a share.

FT  10 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Union Discount
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Union Discount had little choice but to sell Winterflood, otherwise it would
have had insufficient capital to retain its banking licence and continue
with its traditional money market business. It may now be able to turn its
fortunes round. But it will have to make its capital sweat to produce a
decent return, and it is difficult for such a grandiose name to accept the
status of mere niche player. One must hope Union does not become over
ambitious. That would be doubly disconcerting after the careless way it lost
money on September 16.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Olivetti joins communicator
group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLIVETTI, Europe's largest maker of personal computers, is to become the
European partner in an international strategic alliance seeking to exploit
the nascent market for 'personal communicators' - pocket telephones with
inbuilt fax and computing capabilities.
The company is taking an equity stake in EO, a Silicon Valley start-up
company which is marketing personal communicators in the US. The other
members of the alliance are AT&amp;T, the US telecommunications group,
Matsushita of Japan, the world's leading consumer electronics company, and
Marubeni, a leading Japanese trading company. Each member of the alliance
has invested about Dollars 10m in EO.
The alliance has been seeking a European business partner since late last
year when it announced availability in the US of its first personal
communicators which combine the functions of a cellular telephone, facsimile
machine and pen-operated computer.
The device communicates over digital radio telephone circuits which are
already available in the US and will be operational in the UK and Europe
later this year. EO communicators cost between Dollars 1,999 and Dollars
3,299 in the US; UK pricing has not yet been announced but is likely to be
about Pounds 1,500 (Dollars 2,168) for a basic model.
Mr Corrado Passera, Olivetti managing director, said it was a small
investment for Olivetti in a market expected to grow explosively. World
demand has been estimated at 1m customers next year, growing to 100m by
2000, equivalent to Dollars 20bn in annual hardware sales.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Krupp steel plant closure sparks protest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KRUPP Stahl yesterday announced it will close an entire steel mill in
Rheinhausen, in the heart of the Ruhr region, making the mill the first
casualty of the German steel crisis.
The closure, which will take place in the second half of the year, will
involve the loss of 2,000 jobs. Steel production will be partially
transferred to the company's mills in Dortmund, also in the midst of
restructuring. The company also announced a further 2,500 jobs will be cut
there.
News of the closure of the 100-year-old plant in Rheinhausen immediately
sparked protest among steel workers.
'We had to decide with a grieving heart to concentrate our steel production
in Dortmund,' Mr Jurgen Harnisch, chairman of Krupp Stahl, told protesters
yesterday. The production concentration at Dortmund should improve company
results by DM250m (Pounds 106m), in addition to savings of up to DM300m
coming from the merger of Krupp and Hoesch, he said.
Rheinhausen was the site of a fierce battle against closure when steel
workers took to the streets in 1988 and won a reprieve. More than 10,000
workers demonstrated again last month after Krupp Stahl announced it was
considering closing at least one integrated steel plant.
In contrast, survival chances improved at the company's Siegen and Hagen
plants, making steel products. Mr Harnisch said yesterday he was considering
a mini-mill concept to reorganise its special steel production. The move
could save an estimated 1,500 jobs for the 4,000 workers currently employed
at the plant. 'We think this could be a workable concept' he told the
Rheinfalenpost, a regional paper.
The newspaper also cited officials at Krupp Stahl saying prospects for
co-operation talks between their company and Thyssen Stahl and Saarstahl,
the largest and sixth largest German steel producers, were 'very bad'.
Brussels forecasts that European steelmakers will have to cut capacity by
30m tonnes, threatening up to 100,000 jobs.

network delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BID by Banco Central Hispano, the big Spanish commercial bank, to sell its
main nationwide subsidiary network to Banque Nationale de Paris has been
delayed indefinitely, a spokeswoman for BCH said yesterday.
BCH, however, denied press reports that the French bank had pulled out of
protracted negotiations to acquire the 165-branch Banco de Fomento in a deal
that has been valued at up to Pta47bn (Dollars 398m). 'The talks are on
standby,' the spokeswoman said.
The delay is a blow for the Spanish bank's attempts to streamline its
business and boost its liquidity following disappointing 1992 results.
Fuelling the BCH's discomfort is the fact that Germany's Deutsche Bank,
which had expressed interest in Fomento at an earlier stage, last week
acquired Banco de Madrid, the subsidiary network owned by Banesto, a rival
domestic commercial bank.
BCH, posted a 22 per cent drop in net profits last year to Pta52.6bn despite
a sharp increase in extraordinary income from disposals.

Philips, the Dutch electronics group, said yesterday that it planned to cut
800 jobs in Belgium as part of a trend to produce audio equipment in
Singapore and other parts of the Far East.
The job losses, to be spread over two years, are the first big cuts
announced since Mr Jan Timmer, Philips' president, unveiled plans last week
to eliminate 15,000 out of 252,000 jobs in an attempt to restore
profitability in its loss-making consumer electronics business.
The Belgian job losses will focus on Philips' operations in Hasselt, where
the company employs nearly 2,000 people and where it produces compact disc
(CD) players and CD-interactive, a multi-media version of the CD.
Philips in Belgium said these products could be manufactured 25 per cent
cheaper in Singapore. The remaining Hasselt operations will concentrate on
more complex audio equipment.
In Belgium, as in the rest of the world, Philips is confronted by stagnant
markets for consumer electronics.

<TEXT>
MASTERCARD, the US credit card company, yesterday said it had filed a
lawsuit in a New York federal court accusing American Express of using
'false and misleading' advertising to promote its American Express corporate
credit card.
The MasterCard legal action, which seeks to block three American Express
advertisements, also seeks financial damages.
MasterCard alleged in its court action that American Express was not telling
the truth in one advertisement in which it claimed its corporate card was
superior to other cards because there were no late fees or other charges.
American Express, according to the suit, does assess penalties for overdue
payments.
Ms Christine Levite of American Express yesterday claimed there was no merit
to the lawsuit.
Mr Parker Bagley, a lawyer for MasterCard, said the suit was filed after
American Express declined a request to withdraw the offending
advertisements.
General Motors, which has issued more than 5m MasterCard-based GM credit
cards since launching the non-bank card last September, yesterday said it
was launching a Visa-based GM card in the Canadian market. The card will be
issued under an agreement between GM of Canada and Toronto Dominion Bank.

FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: M and S bought
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A surge of speculative buying of Marks and Spencer helped the shares put on
2 1/2 at 350p in trade of nearly 9m shares, with a further 3m dealt in the
options market. Some analysts reported whispers of strong February sales by
the high street retailer, to follow a healthy performance in January.
There was also talk of pressure exerted on M and S's suppliers as the group
attempts to improve margins.
The company is not due to report its final results until May, but
yesterday's speculation will do nothing to dampen expectations in the market
that the group will exceed most current analysts' forecasts.
Brown Shipley moved forward 4 to 40p after it was revealed that GPG, the UK
investment company controlled by Sir Ron Brierley, was considering a full
bid for the group after increasing its stake to 22 per cent by buying a
block of 2.35m shares, or 14.8 per cent, at 35p a share.
Continuing worries about the extent of the losses arising from the bank's
involvement in the Bombay securities market, and lingering fears that
today's preliminary numbers may be accompanied by a large rights issue, took
their toll of Standard Chartered shares. The stock retreated a further 8 to
691p on above-average turnover of 1.3m.
Barclays' rally came to an abrupt halt, the shares relinquishing 8 to 413p
on heavy volume of 8.4m.
Sun Alliance outperformed the rest of the composite insurance sector as US
buying, thought to have been prompted by a buy note published by one of the
US investment banks, lifted the shares 9 to 342p.
Bearish noises surrounding the leading building material groups saw BPB slip
3 to 215p and Blue Circle ease 2 to 234p. Redland held at 482p and RMC
declined 11 to 611p.
Meyer fell 10 to 318p, with BZW said to have lowered its profits forecasts
for the group. For the current year BZW is said to be predicting profits of
Pounds 11m, down from Pounds 15m, and for next year it expects the group to
achieve profits of Pounds 18m compared with a previous estimate of Pounds
19m.
Conglomerate Hanson eased a penny to 257p, with analysts at BZW reported to
have come to the view that there was little upside in the stock. The
securities house is believed to have also reduced its profits estimate for
the year to September 1994, coming down to the bottom of the range which is
around Pounds 1.19bn.
With good figures expected today from international conglomerate BTR, the
shares were once again in demand. They moved a penny forward to 591p, with
turnover increasing to 5.4m.
Results from Hillsdown generated good two-way business of 8.4m shares, but
left the price steady at 163p. However, Nomura, which continued to mark the
stock a weak hold, said questions over long-term strategy remain unanswered.
Nervousness ahead of results today from Cadbury-Schweppes left the stock 5
adrift at 494p. Yorkshire Food Group made a strong market debut, the shares
coming to the market at 110p and closing 28 forward at 138p. Turnover came
to 8.6m.
Asda continued its seemingly relentless march forward, with Hoare Govett
positive following a recent company visit. The stock was also buoyed by
suggestions it may shortly join the FT-SE 100 Index. The shares gained 1 1/2
at 69 3/4 p in turnover of 33m.
However, according to market gossip, Asda'a rumoured inclusion in the
Footsie could be at the expense of WH Smith, whose 'A' shares lost 7 to 422p
yesterday.
Buying pressure squeezed Stakis higher as shares in the hotel and casino
group were said to be chased by institutions. The stock climbed 3 1/2 to 51
1/2 p.
Speculation in Paris that Euro Disney would shortly be announcing the
restructuring of some debt sent the shares surging by 65 to 1080p but was
scouted by sources close to the company.
Thorn EMI rebounded from Monday's weakness, with SG Warburg said to be
positive. The shares appreciated 10 to 874p.
Drinks stocks continued to respond to positive talk on consumer spending and
economic recovery, with the second liners taking centre stage yesterday. HP
Bulmer jumped 16 to 393p, Greene King rose 5 to 533p, helped by an analysts
visit, and Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley gained 11 at 599p. Bass was steady at 593p
following a reported downgrade from James Capel.
Profit-taking amid nervous trading as British Aerospace met with fund
managers yesterday afternoon left the shares 5 lighter at 272p.
A view that shares in engineering group Glynwed International, which
reported a 30 per cent increase in full-year profits, were overvalued
weakened the stock. It gave up 7 to 282p, with one market watcher suggesting
little improvement in trading in the short term.
Vickers shed a penny to 118p ahead of today's figures, with a rights issue
of between Pounds 80m and Pounds 100m expected from the company. BBA gained
5 at 171p on reporting a 53 per cent profits increase.
Profits also improved at Transfer Technology and the shares responded by
jumping 29 to 517p. Profit-taking drove Danka Business down 52 to close at
632p.
News that Ocean Group was in talks to sell its bulk liquid storage company
boosted the shares, which added 10 at 296p.
Glaxo rebounded from the weakness inflicted by speculation over its dispute
with US drug authorities, the shares leaping 16 to 666p. Medeva rose 9 to
225p ahead of results expected today.

A BID by Banco Central Hispano, the big Spanish commercial bank, to sell its
main nationwide subsidiary network to Banque Nationale de Paris has been
delayed indefinitely, a spokeswoman for BCH said yesterday.
BCH, however, denied press reports that the French bank had pulled out of
protracted negotiations to acquire the 165-branch Banco de Fomento in a deal
that has been valued at up to Pta47bn (Dollars 398m). 'The talks are on

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Zurich buys much of Municipal Mutual
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUNICIPAL Mutual Insurance, the local authority-owned insurer which withdrew
from the market last year, yesterday concluded negotiations to sell
substantial parts of its business to Zurich Insurance, one of Europe's
largest insurance companies.
The deal was predicted to go ahead after Zurich offered renewals to all
existing local council policyholders under an interim agreement with MMI in
October.
As expected the Swiss group will not assume responsibility for liabilities
arising on policies which were underwritten by MMI before September 30.
Zurich said yesterday that it expected the EC competition authorities in
Brussels to approve the deal.
Zurich will employ 1,500 MMI staff and also provide claims servicing
facilities to MMI. Zurich, which will call its new subsidiary Zurich
Municipal, has purchased the Bournemouth office building of MMI and taken
leases on remaining operational locations.
Welcoming the deal Mr Brian Wright, MMI chief executive, said: 'The deal
achieves a major part of our plans for the sale or solvent run-off of the
business.'
MMI withdrew from the market last May but management, lead by Mr Wright,
were initially unsuccessful in finding a buyer. A number of UK companies
examined the business. In October a deal involving the French group,
Garantie des Foncionnaires Mutuelles, fell through.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Insuring exports
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS HAS welcomed Mr John Major's recent public espousal of the role of
exports in his strategy for economy recovery. But some industrialists argue
that they are paying a price for the recent privatisation of the part of the
Export Credits Guarantee Department that handles short-term export credit
insurance. They are wrong on the privatisation, which has been a success.
Where they have a legitimate complaint, however, is over the lack of
government arrangements for reinsurance against political risks after 1994.
Exporters are getting better service from NCM - the Dutch credit insurer
which acquired the ECGD's short-term business - than could have been
delivered by a government department. They can, for example, take out a
single credit package for both domestic and international business, where
before they needed to take out two. Furthermore, in a market in which NCM is
often competing with four other companies for an insurance contract, many
exporters have seen premium rates fall.
Meanwhile, the government no longer needs to worry about the bill for
insurance of commercial risks, which are firmly in the private sector, where
they belong. On reinsurance, however, the government may have gone too far.
It must reconsider its decision to make private-sector reinsurers assume
full responsibility for coverage of political risks associated with wars or
political upheavals.
Reinsurers such as Munich Re and Swiss Re insist that the private sector
does not have the capacity to cope with such political risks, even within
the EC. They argue that commercial insurers could never cope with the
concentration of risks involved, while the potential effects of the current
Italian political crisis on sales to state-owned companies demonstrate that
those risks are not confined to developing countries.
As part of the original privatisation, NCM won the government's agreement to
offer reinsurance for political risks for a three-year period to the end of
1994. But it is concerned that business is being affected by uncertainty
beyond that year.
The government should acknowledge that wholesale privatisation of
reinsurance may be an over-ambitious short-term aim. It should prolong the
transitional reinsurance arrangements, not only for NCM, but for competitors
such as Trade Indemnity as well. By setting clear limits to government
exposure, however, and ensuring the risk of reinsurance is shared by the
private sector, the government could also limit the costs to itself and help
foster a private market substantial enough to handle all risks.
The longer-term goal must be the elimination of reinsurance by governments
of developed countries against political risks created by one another. Such
competition is particularly absurd within the European Community. New York
does not insure its firms against political risk in California. Why should
the UK insure its exporters against political risks in Italy?

FT  10 MAR 93 / Steps to boost exports urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL investment write-downs, cuts in corporation tax, an exporters' loan
guarantee scheme and bankers' export guarantees should be part of Mr Norman
Lamont's Budget, Mr Ian Campbell, director- general of the Institute for
Export, said yesterday.
Mr Campbell urged the government to extend beyond 1994 its transitional
arrangements to provide NCM, the UK's leading export credit insurer, with
political risk reinsurance.
'The UK will be the only EC country without a permanent facility to reinsure
political risks,' Mr Campbell said at the UPS/Export Times Exporter of the
Year award ceremony. 'There is not sufficient private-sector reinsurance
available, and this will make British exporters less able to compete.'
He urged the government to 'work in partnership with industry' to improve
export performance, which has remained stagnant over the past three years.
He called for a 100 per cent first-year writing down allowance on capital
investment in manufacturing industry, and a reduction in corporation tax to
10 per cent.
These moves would boost investment in manufacturing capacity, which has
grown by just 19 per cent between 1970 and 1990. This compares with 43 per
cent growth in Germany, France and Italy, 86 per cent in the US, and 129 per
cent in Japan, according to the Centre for Economics and Business Research.
Mr Campbell called for an exporters' loan guarantee scheme for small
companies at the early stage of exporting. A low-cost bankers' guarantee
scheme would reduce the 'prohibitive expense' of financing credits for
initial orders out of overdrafts.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Weill set to regain Shearson brokerage empire for Dollars
1bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR SANFORD WEILL, the Wall Street entrepreneur who built the Shearson
brokerage empire in the 1970s before selling it to American Express, is
about to recapture his creation for Dollars 1bn (Pounds 700m).
The financial services and travel group, whose image has been tarnished
lately by bitter boardroom battles, is understood to be only days away from
selling Shearson's retail brokerage and asset management businesses which
suffered heavy losses last year. It bought Shearson for Dollars 900m in
1981.
Mr Weill, a former American Express president who left the company in 1985,
now runs Primerica, the US financial services group which already owns Smith
Barney, another broker. The purchase of Shearson would represent a return to
the kind of daredevil deal-making that made the 59-year-old Brooklyn native
a Wall Street legend in the 1970s.
The proposed sale would create a securities powerhouse to rival Merrill
Lynch as the biggest broker in the US, with combined annual revenues of more
than Dollars 13bn, almost 500 branches and 11,400 brokers. It would also
give Primerica ownership of commercial property in Manhattan, including a
40-storey office block and adjacent computer centre.
Primerica and American Express yesterday confirmed the Shearson talks. One
American Express executive said: 'My sense is that we are almost there. The
agreement could happen within the next day or two.' The two companies
discussed a similar proposal three years ago, but the talks stalled.
Lehman Brothers, the investment banking arm of the Shearson group, has been
left out of the present negotiations. It was, however, learnt yesterday that
a management buy-out is being discussed by senior executives at Lehman
Brothers.
American Express insiders think it likely that the group, keen to bolster
capital and focus on its core travel and card businesses, will eventually
agree to a Lehman buy-out.
Mr Weill started on Wall Street as a trading floor clerk for Bear Stearns,
forming his own brokerage firm in the 1960s when still in his 20s. After
selling Shearson in 1981, he became president of American Express. In 1985,
he became one of several presidents to leave during the chairmanship of Mr
James Robinson, who was himself forced to resign last month.
Mr Weill, whose lawyers were yesterday examining the draft agreement, is a
close friend of Mr Harvey Golub, the man who replaced Mr Robinson as chief
executive of American Express. It was Mr Weill, a godfather to Mr Golub's
son, who hired Mr Golub to run an American Express subsidiary in 1983.
American Express executives said Mr Golub had less hesitation in selling
Shearson than did Mr Robinson, who had boasted during the 1980s of using
Shearson as part of a 'financial services supermarket'.
News of the talks was well received by the stock markets. Primerica's share
price jumped by Dollars 4 3/4 to close in New York at Dollars 44 3/4 and
American Express's rose by Dollars 1 1/8 to finish at Dollars 27 7/8 .
Shearson has been a big burden to its parent in recent years. It lost more
than Dollars 900m in 1990, and after a brief return to profitability in
1991, racked up a loss of Dollars 116m last year while other US securities
firms made big profits. Smith Barney, for example, earned a record Dollars
170m in 1992.
If American Express sells the brokerage operations it would be the latest in
a series of asset disposals. Only last week it announced plans to raise more
than Dollars 1bn by selling more than half of its majority stake in First
Data Corporation, the data and transaction processing company.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Cartel probe into WestLB
influence stepped up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundeskartellamt, Germany's federal cartel office, has stepped up its
investigation into the scope of Westdeutsche Landesbank's influence over
Touristik Union International (TUI), Europe's largest tourist operator.
The Berlin-based cartel office has served an order on WestLB and a number of
other German companies, seeking clarification of recent changes in the
shareholding structure of Walter Kahn Verwaltungs, a holding company which
owns 40.2 per cent of TUI.
The move is part of the Bundeskartellamt's longstanding investigation into
WestLB's role in the German travel sector. WestLB, state bank for
North-Rhine Westphalia, owns a 34 per cent stake in LTU, Germany's largest
charter-flight operator, and last year bought a majority stake in Thomas
Cook, the UK-based travel company.
The authorities are concerned that TUI may have come under the de facto
management control of LTU/WestLB as a result of changes in the shareholding
structure of Walter Kahn. WestLB al-ready exercises influence on TUI via its
majority holding in the Horten retail group, which owns an indirect 25 per
cent stake in TUI.
If this were so, there would be competition implications for the German
travel market, the Bundeskartellamt believes.
Mr Jurgen Kiecker, Kartellamt spokesman, said the information order had been
sent to the Sudwestdeutsche Landesbank, state bank for Baden-Wurttemberg and
also a shareholder in Walter Kahn, as well as WestLB and TUI.
The move follows the cartel office's decision last December to reopen
investigations into WestLB's purchase of its stake in Horten in 1991. This
investigation was later blocked by the Berlin courts.
WestLB said yesterday that it neither had control of TUI, nor sought to win
it. Its stake in Walter Kahn was only 16.77 per cent, the bank said.

<TEXT>
ONTARIO HYDRO, one of North America's biggest utilities, is cutting staff by
a further 4,500, bringing planned reductions since late last year to 6,000.
This is part of the utility's restructuring to deal with a debt crisis and a
30 per cent increase in power rates over the past three years.
Total payroll will decline to 23,000 mainly through attrition and early
retirement, said Mr Maurice Strong, the chairman. Negotiations will begin
soon with the unions.
A programme to re-tube the Bruce A nuclear reactors, at a cost of nearly
CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) is being deferred indefinitely. A Bruce heavy
water plant will close in 1994.
Ontario Hydro expects surplus generating capacity of 3,500MW once its
Darlington nuclear plant is on full stream this summer. Demand for
electricity has declined over the past three years.
Mr Strong said about CDollars 10bn will be cut out of the utility's CDollars
30bn 10-year capital spending programme.

More than 100,000 North Koreans held a rally in Pyongyang yesterday as the
country went on a 'semi-war' footing in response to a huge military exercise
in South Korea, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The (North) Korean central news
agency said Workers' Party official Choe Tae-pok addressed the rally, called
in support of an order by military chief Kim Jong-il putting the communist
nation on heightened alert.
'No one can vouch they (Seoul and Washington) will not go into a real war
against North Korea while staging the manoeuvres,' Choe said. Washington and
Seoul say the annual Team Spirit joint military exercise is a purely
defensive exercise. On Monday Kim Jong-il said he was acting because 'war
may break out any moment'.

The United Nation's top peacekeeper in Cambodia imposed strict export quotas
on sawn timber yesterday to preserve dwindling resources and curb the income
of recalcitrant Khmer Rouge guerrillas, Reuter reports from Phnom Penh.
A ban on the export of uncut logs, backed by the United Nations, was agreed
last September by the Supreme National Council, representing all Cambodian
factions, to protect Cambodia's resources.
It also curbed a lucrative source of income for the Khmer Rouge in an
attempt to get them to abide by the pact. But UN sources say the guerrillas
and the government have been circumventing the ban by setting up sawmills
and exporting sawn timber.
Mr Yasushi Akashi, who heads the 21,000-strong UN Transitional Authority in
Cambodia (Untac), told a news conference the Funcinpec faction and the Khmer
People's National Liberation Front sought a complete ban on exports of sawn
timber.
But this was opposed by the government, which would have been faced with a
cut-off of one of their few remaining sources of income.
To break the deadlock, Mr Akashi used his executive powers as SNC chairman
and imposed a 30 per cent reduction. He said the total volume of sawn timber
exported in 1993 would be the equivalent of 160,000 square metres of
unprocessed logs.

The Angolan government has warned of a long and bloody round of civil war as
Unita rebels yesterday threatened to 'neutralise' oil installations in the
north if government forces tried to recapture them, Reuter reports from
Luanda.
The government army chief warned Angolans earlier that Unita possessed a
'terrible war machine' and they should prepare for a long war which could
cause more casualties than the previous 16-year civil conflict.
The loss of the highland capital of Huambo at the weekend dealt a
double-blow to the government, hard-pressed since fighting resumed in
earnest two months ago after Unita's rejection of last September's election
results.

RUSSIA yesterday stepped up pressure on Bosnia's warring parties to accept
the international peace plan, dividing their land into 10 semi-autonomous
provinces mainly along ethnic lines, agencies report.
The Russian statement was issued as Bosnia's Moslem-led government and the
Bosnian Serbs considered their response to the peace plan drawn up by
mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
'The current round of talks in New York confirmed the absence of a real
alternative to the Vance-Owen plan as the basis for a settlement in
Bosnia-Hercegovina,' Russian President Boris Yeltsin said.
The peace talks in New York were interrupted on Saturday to give the Bosnian
Moslem government and its Serb adversaries time to decide whether they
accept the mediators' map.

<TEXT>
MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, has written to fellow western leaders
urging their support for Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, in his
constitutional struggle, according to diplomats in Bonn.
In particular, Mr Kohl has passed on a query from Mr Yeltsin asking for
confirmation of western political support if he is forced to introduce
emergency measures in Russia. The letter, sent directly to western leaders
in the Group of Seven industrialised states, including US President Bill
Clinton, President Francois Mitterrand of France, and Mr John Major, the
British prime minister, reports Mr Yeltsin's confidence that the Russian
military will support him if he seeks emergency powers, the diplomats said.
It also spells out the Russian leader's determination to make one final
effort at reaching agreement with the Russian parliament, while expressing
some doubt about the likelihood of such a deal.
The letter follows Chancellor Kohl's brief stop-over in Moscow for talks
with the Russian president last week, on his way back from a two-week trip
in Asia.
It reflects deep German anxiety about the growing instability in Russia, and
doubts about the ability of Mr Yeltsin to implement a coherent government
policy during the current constitutional crisis.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Postel Investment Management drops US
venture capital link
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POSTEL Investment Management, one of Britain's largest institutional
investors, has dropped plans to establish a European venture capital fund
jointly with a US investment company.
Postel, which has Pounds 20bn under management, and Chancellor Capital
Management, a New York-based money management company, have dissolved their
joint venture after failing to reach their minimum fund-raising target of
Dollars 100m (Pounds 70m). Postel was to have provided Dollars 20m of this.
When the project was announced a little less than two years ago it was
hailed as a significant departure for Postel, which has venture and
development capital investments worth Pounds 300m on behalf of the Post
Office and British Telecommunications pension funds. Postel had not
previously managed funds for third party investors.
Chancellor, which led the US fund-raising drive, decided in December that
there was no point in continuing, said Mr Ray Maxwell, venture capital
manager for Postel.
'It was a disappointment,' he said. 'We were over in the US every month in
1992 fund-raising. This sends a rather disturbing message to the European
venture capital community. The Americans have been disappointed with the
results of their investments in Europe.'
The reasons for the failure were a combination of poor economic news from
Europe, currency uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate mechanism and a
change in the attitude of US institutions towards investing indirectly
through venture capital funds.
Chancellor's fund-raising may also have suffered because another large
international fund, launched by Hancock Venture Partners, went to market
first.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Arts: The Importance of Being Earnest - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OSCAR Wilde's best known work always had a claim to be the wittiest play in
the English language. In Nicholas Hytner's exquisite new production at The
Aldwych, it wins the prize hands down.
Savouring the delights, I shall come to Maggie Smith's Lady Bracknell last.
There is plenty more on show. The two parts that hit you most, almost as if
they had never been played before, are Claire Skinner's Cecily and Margaret
Tyzack's Miss Prism. This is a Cecily (remember the pronunciation - Sissely)
who will never be upstaged by Gwendolen. She may be a girl of 18 brought up
in the country, but she is fairly brimming with determination and
self-confidence: a Lady Bracknell in embryo. It is no disrespect to Susannah
Harker's Gwendolen to say that this is the first time that Cecily seems to
be the better part. Ms Harker accepts the downgrading with grace.
The secret about Ms Tyzack's Miss Prism is that she is really and obviously
attractive from the start: not at all the plain spinster sometimes
suggested. She is a very clever woman, and not ashamed of it. And that, too,
is one of the secrets of Hytner's production: The Importance is presented as
a highly cerebral, even intellectual play. True, the women are more
intelligent than the men, but that only adds to the wit.
Possibly not everyone knows that 'earnest' was once the in-word for 'gay'.
That again adds to the fun: the young women in the play know this perfectly
well, which is why they love the name and Lady Bracknell has a particular
reason for disliking it.
Intellectual in-jokes abound. Take the frequent references to the German
language. Is it a precise or a romantic form compared to English? Note the
peculiarly modern use of the word 'entrapped' and Cecily's near borrowing
from Lear in 'Never, never, never'. The Importance is such a good play that
you can enjoy it for the plot and the performances alone.
Hytner's production pulls out every stop. The sets by Bob Crowley get better
and better as we move from Half-Moon Street in London W something, to the
garden and then the morning-room at the Manor House, Woolton. There can be
few more pleasurable comic scenes than Gwendolen and Cecily together at tea
outside the house. Remember the business of the sugar lumps.
If the men are intellectually inferior, they can still act. Watch the sudden
swelling in Richard E Grant's cheek when, as Algernon dressed in mourning
clothes he confronts the brother he has invented, then banished. The facial
movements are even better than most of his lines.
With incidental delights like that, who needs Lady Bracknell and how can she
played in a way that seems fresh? Ms Smith triumphs by presenting Lady B as
an immensely well educated woman, up with the latest statistics and
intellectual fashions. To be sure, she is a snob to boot, but that makes her
the more formidable: she knows how to be a snob well. She also has a proper
respect for money and an understanding of investment.
Ms Smith deals with the famous 'handbag' line by taking it in her stride as
not being especially remarkable. Then she strikes: the stress comes a little
later with 'the line is immaterial'. This is a marvellous example of an
actress teasing the audience, then creating a new reading. See towards the
end, the way she says of Algernon: 'He has nothing, but he looks
everything.' Physical movements again crown the text. In short, this is a
perfect evening, and it adds to the pleasure that other women should be
allowed to run Lady Bracknell close.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Warning on EC postal plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TOUGH regulatory regime would be essential to ensure that a universal
European postal service was not exploited by monopoly operators, the
Consumers' Association said yesterday.
A European Community green paper on developing a single market for postal
services has suggested the gradual liberalisation of cross-border and direct
mail services in Europe. Although many services would be open to
competition, some areas of activity could be left to monopolies.
The association said in a response to the proposals that they would require
a regulatory framework to ensure that market power handed to particular
operators 'is not exploited in terms of price, quality, availability and
redress provided'.
An EC suggestion that persistent failure to meet service targets might
result in sanctions against operators - including seeking tenders from
alternative providers or the linking of permitted price rises to quality
targets - was also welcomed by the association.
A survey of UK postal users conducted by the association shows that
customers want to keep the present balance of quality of service and price.
Most, however, would accept the scrapping of the two-tier postal service in
favour of a single class. A majority also had no objection to deliveries
being restricted to one a day.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COST of setting up the UK's national lottery, the biggest in the world
so far, could be around Pounds 500m, Raymond Snoddy writes.
The scale of the project was set out yesterday by Mr Craig Watson, a
vice-president of GTEC, the US company which claims more than a 70 per cent
share of the world market for computerised lottery systems.
Mr Watson believes that many people in the UK have not yet realised the full
extent of the business opportunities that will arise from the setting up of
the lottery.
The computerised operating system which is likely to have something in the
region of 20,000 terminals to check and verify both details of purchase and
individual numbers could cost between Pounds 100m and Pounds 200m, Mr Watson
believes.

THE PROSPECT of chaos in schools in England and Wales after Easter grew
yesterday, Robert Taylor writes.
Members of the 190,000-strong National Association of Schoolmasters/Union of
Women Teachers voted overwhelmingly to boycott the assessment and testing
associated with the government's national curriculum.
In a secret ballot, 52,493 (88 per cent) voted in favour of the proposed
boycott and only 7,154 (12 per cent) against in a 57 per cent turnout.
'The members' verdict is a stunning indictment of the government's policies
on testing and assessment,' said NASUWT's general secretary Mr Nigel de
Gruchy. He expects Friday's meeting of the union executive to give the
go-ahead to the boycott.
Baroness Blatch, the education minister, condemned the action as
'unprofessional' saying it would 'damage and disrupt children's education'.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK has complained to Japan over the latter's failure to comply with a
Gatt ruling made in 1987 on its liquor taxation system which discriminates
against imports. Mr Richard Needham, minister of state for trade, yesterday
expressed his concern in a meeting with Mr Ichiro Aisawa, parliamentary
vice-minister at the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
Mr Needham was adding the UK's voice to growing EC criticism of Japan over
the discriminatory taxation system which still remains despite the Gatt
panel ruling. Criticism that it has failed to comply with Gatt
recommendations comes at a sensitive time for Japan, which is moving towards
a more Gatt-oriented trade policy.
The Japanese government, under growing pressure over trade from the US and
EC, has said it was more likely to refer to Gatt in trying to resolve thorny
issues, especially where US retaliation was likely.
In 1989 the Japanese government made some changes to its liquor taxation
system by, for example, removing the difference in taxes between local and
imported liquor. But the EC has become impatient after waiting five years
for Japan to remove the last tax areas placing imports at a disadvantage.
A substantial differential still exists between Japanese shochu, a
potato-based liquor, and whisky and brandy. The taxation differential
between one class of whisky and a certain class of shochu, for example, is
nine times. The EC is also concerned about a move in Japan to introduce
another tax category for low strength whisky: mizuwari, or whisky diluted
with mineral water.
The EC formally requested Japan to comply fully with its obligations under
Gatt at the last EC-Japan ministerial meeting in Brussels in January. Japan
does not believe it has failed to implement the Gatt recommendation.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S new economy minister, Mr Eliseu Resende, yesterday outlined a
belt-tightening programme to rebuild the country's economy and curb
inflation of over 25 per cent a month, Reuter reports from Brasilia.
His appearance before the Senate to set out President Itamar Franco's
economic plans was also designed to ease congressional worries about the
government and his own appointment last week following the resignation of
his predecessor, Mr Paulo Haddad, over appointments to the central bank
board.
Mr Resende largely repeated points made by himself and the president on
combating inflation and lifting the economy from deep recession. The main
goal, he said, was a 'selective return to economic growth from sustainable
bases, generating more employment and more equal distribution of income'.
Mr Franco would move to sell off more state companies at a faster rate, he
said.
State companies would also be made more efficient and he promised to limit
investment in them. There would be 'rigid control and rationalisation of
state companies'.
Mr Rasende promised an 'austere fiscal policy. The national Treasury is
going to spend less than it takes in', he said. Other points in his plan
included continuing to open Brazil's economy, tax reform, exchange rates 'at
levels adequate enough to promote exports', meeting Brazil's foreign debt
commitments and strict spending controls.
The minister also defended President Franco's tax package, due for a final
Senate vote today, and its centerpiece tax on financial transactions. He
said the Dollars 600m a month which it was estimated the tax would generate
was 'extremely important to balance our accounts and bring our programme
into effect'.
Mr Resende also said the president would consult with supporters among
congressional and party leaders before final details of his plan were
released.
Mr Paulo Cesar Ximenes, Inter-American Development Bank director, is to be
the new central bank president.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Aer Lingus executive resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Cathal Mullan, chief executive of Aer Lingus, the Irish Republic's
national airline, resigned last night and was replaced by Mr Bernie Cahill,
the state-owned company's chairman, Our Foreign Staff reports.
The appointment of Mr Cahill was announced in a statement in the Dail by
Transport Minister Brian Cowen, who said the government would be prepared to
support 'convincing and visible action' by Mr Cahill to solve Aer Lingus's
problems. He made it clear a large cash injection was out of the question.
Reports earlier yesterday had indicated that Aer Lingus, already facing
losses running into hundreds of millions of pounds, stood to lose around
IPounds 90m (Pounds 91m) this year alone.
Mr Cowen denied reports that a cabinet sub-committee, established to monitor
the Aer Lingus position, and headed by premier Albert Reynolds, had plans to
call in international consultants to advise on the airline's future.
Earlier this year it was reported that Aer Lingus was considering shedding
500 of its 7,000-strong work force as part of a survival plan and seeking
more government cash aid.

RUSSIA yesterday stepped up pressure on Bosnia's warring parties to accept
the international peace plan, dividing their land into 10 semi-autonomous
provinces mainly along ethnic lines, agencies report.
The Russian statement was issued as Bosnia's Moslem-led government and the
Bosnian Serbs considered their response to the peace plan drawn up by
international mediators Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen.
'The current round of talks in New York confirmed the absence of a real
alternative to the Vance-Owen plan as the basis for a settlement in
Bosnia-Hercegovina,' Russian President Boris Yeltsin said.
The peace talks in New York were interrupted on Saturday to give the Bosnian
Moslem government and its Serb adversaries time to decide whether they
accept the mediators' map.

FT  10 MAR 93 / MEPs demand EC growth package to help create jobs

<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the European Parliament yesterday called for a reflationary jobs
package for Europe, warning that rising unemployment was undermining public
confidence in the European Community and its plans for European union.
During a debate on the European Commission's annual economic report for
1993, MEPs criticised as 'timid' the EC growth package agreed by member
states at the Edinburgh summit last December. Without 3 per cent growth, the
number of people out of work in the Community would reach 17m - or almost 11
per cent - by the end of the year. Mr Henning Christophersen, EC economics
commissioner, acknowledged that the Commission's growth forecast of 0.8 per
cent for 1993 raised questions about whether member states would meet the
'convergence criteria' required to be eligible for European Monetary Union
in 1996. But he held out the prospect of a speedy drop in interest rates,
particularly in Germany, to offset the recession.
A stark warning of the risks of low growth and competitive devaluations
caused by the recent monetary instability in the EC appeared in a
parliamentary report on the Commission's growth forecasts prepared by Mr
Alman Metten, a Dutch Socialist MEP.
According to the report, 'recent developments show that EC countries are so
interdependent that devaluation by one produces a domino effect of competing
devaluations. Were these phenomena to continue long, then even the single
market would be endangered.'
Mr Metten said yesterday that without lower interest rates in Germany, the
French franc risked having to float outside the ERM.
He pointed to the possibility of setting target zones of fluctuation for the
dollar, yen, D-Mark and possibly the Ecu, to restore monetary stability.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Greeks queue to file tax returns in Athens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LONG queues at Inland Revenue offices around Athens are the first indication
that the Greek government's efforts to reduce tax evasion may be having an
effect.
The Finance Ministry is optimistic that its television campaign, exhorting
Greeks to 'make a new start' by filing a tax return, will produce a 15 per
cent rise in the number of income declarations received by Friday's
deadline.
Recession and the launch of the single market has affected revenue
collection in recent months, with VAT receipts showing a sharp decline.
However, Greece faces much bigger problems in trying to restrain an
underground economy that may have doubled in size over the past decade, and
reversing a widely held belief that no intelligent citizen pays more than a
minimum of tax.
'One of the main reasons revenues are behind just now is because, under
single market rules, VAT is no longer collected at customs but when goods
are sold,' according to Mr Stefanos Manos, the economy minister.
'That's less worrying than the very large degree of tax evasion. The black
economy is anywhere between 35 and 50 per cent of the real economy. That's a
huge amount of money going untapped.'
Cuts in the levels of corporation tax and income tax, introduced when the
fiscal system was overhauled last year, appear to have made little impact on
attitudes.
A recent Finance Ministry check of credit card receipts on the island of
Santorini, a popular tourist destination, revealed that shopkeepers were
declaring only 8.5 per cent of transactions. It was followed by a sample
cross-checking of company returns, which resulted in about 25,000 businesses
being asked to file a supplementary tax declaration.
Computerisation is under way, but it will be some time before automatic
cross-checking can be widely applied. Meanwhile, tax officials are being
offered an incentive to press for payment of tax arrears: a share of the
receipts.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Goodman defends company against fraud charges
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Larry Goodman, the controversial founder of Goodman International,
Europe's largest meat processor, yesterday appeared in the witness box to
defend his company against allegations of fraud, abuse of EC payments
systems, and political favouritism.
Speaking before a parliamentary enquiry into the Irish meat industry, Mr
Goodman claimed the allegations have been 'blown up out of all proportion'.
Although he did not deny some breaches of regulations had taken place at a
couple of his plants, he said that a comparison should have been made with
other companies in the industry. 'We can back our record against anyone's,'
he said.
Goodman International ran into financial difficulties in 1990 following the
Gulf war and the suspension of export contracts to Iraq. An examiner was
appointed in August of that year to enable the company to arrange an
agreement with its 33 creditor banks to whom it owed some IPounds 460m
(Pounds 450m).
The banks had guaranteed a further IPounds 200m against beef contracts.
Answering allegations that his company had taken advantage of the EC
intervention system, Mr Goodman said: 'Prior to Ireland joining the EC, our
net margins were in excess of 5 per cent. They have never been at that level
since. We lobbied very strongly against the intervention system as we were
concerned that people would sell without any marketing effort. It removed
the incentive for companies to market in Europe and abroad.'
The Goodman group has become Europe's biggest supplier of meat products to
supermarket chains in the UK.
Accusations of dishonesty made in the witness box by the prime minister, Mr
Albert Reynolds, against a cabinet colleague last October resulted in the
collapse of the coalition and a general election last year.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Treaty delay threatens jobs, says PM: Maastricht bill
setback irks EC diplomats; Major to press ahead on ratification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, DAVID GARDNER and LIONEL BARBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday warned Labour and Euro-sceptic Tory MPs that delays
to ratification of the Maastricht treaty would cost British jobs as the
government's defeat on Monday provoked angry recriminations within
Conservative ranks.
The prime minister launched his attack as the government sought to reassure
its European partners that Britain would press ahead with ratification as
swiftly as possible. Mr Major said: 'The treaty is in the national interest
and we will pursue it.' Downing Street shrugged off as 'trivial' the 22-vote
defeat on a Labour amendment but indicated government hopes of completing
Maastricht's parliamentary stages this summer are receding. Ratification is
expected before the parliamentary session ends in the autumn, officials
said.
This provoked a mixture of frustration and resignation in Brussels, with
some European Community diplomats speculating about Mr Major's ability to
deliver ratification. European MPs also expressed dismay over the latest
delay and suggested it signalled a loss of authority on Mr Major's part.
Labour's victory on Monday means a Commons 'report' stage will follow the
current committee stage - injecting a delay of as much as a month.
The government hopes the shock of the defeat will lead to strong pressure
from local constituency associations on the rebels to force them into line.
But initial soundings suggested that most of the hard-line Euro-sceptics had
the tacit support of their associations.
At Westminster, conflict between Conservative rebels and loyalists
intensified, in spite of attempts by senior Tories to concentrate attacks on
opposition parties. Tensions were exacerbated by the deals offered by the
government to Welsh and Scottish nationalists in an unsuccessful attempt to
buy enough votes to head off defeat.
The fevered atmosphere was fuelled by confirmation that Mr Michael Portillo,
chief secretary to the Treasury, had lunched recently with Mr Bryan Gould, a
prominent Labour Euro-sceptic. Colleagues of Mr Portillo, seen as
Thatcherite on Europe, played down the significance of the meeting, saying
the two were old friends.
The next twists on Maastricht are likely to centre on amendments introduced
by Labour on economic and monetary union, due for debate next week, and then
on Maastricht's social chapter, described by Sir Marcus Fox, chairman of the
Tory's backbench 1922 committee, as the 'crunch' point.
In angry Commons exchanges with Mr John Smith, the Labour leader, Mr Major
again said the social chapter would 'choke off foreign investment and
destroy jobs'. But he said 'delay in ratifying the Maastricht treaty would
do exactly the same thing'.
Tory Euro-sceptic MPs, who voted with Labour on Monday, were meeting last
night to discuss tactics. Ministers and officials are not ruling out the
possibility of further defeats.
Labour is pledged not to back 'wrecking amendments' that could stop
ratification - and its MPs are expected to reaffirm that stance at a meeting
today. But there is a grey area over its social chapter amendments which are
aimed at requiring the government to insert the chapter into British
legislation before the treaty is ratified.
In Brussels, one diplomat described Mr Major's latest setback as creating
'frustration bordering on exasperation', adding: 'This is throwing a spanner
in the workings of the whole Community; we're in limbo.'
But, at the same time, diplomats from large member states played down the
significance of what one described as 'a procedural hiccup'.
Some EC states' officials criticised Mr Major for allowing uncertainty to
develop last year after Danish voters' rejection of the treaty, thereby
allowing his opponents to gather strength.
'We have all had difficult political problems to resolve, but they are there
to be confronted,' one diplomat said.
In the European Parliament, Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, Socialist group chairman,
said he was worried about Mr Major's mismanagement of the ratification
process. 'I don't know whether he has control to get Maastricht through.'
Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, said: 'I look forward to
ratification of the treaty from the UK side, in the interest of Denmark and
the rest of Europe.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (10): A lot of time and money -
Robert Rice on the implications of recovering debts through the courts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
USING the courts to recover debts is both time-consuming and costly.
There is little point in taking legal action unless the creditor is sure
that the debtor has the necessary funds or assets to meet the debt if the
court orders payment.
Before embarking on court action creditors should see first whether a
solicitor's letter or placing the debt in the hands of a debt collector will
produce the desired result.
Actions to recover debt can be brought in the High Court, the county court
or under the county court small claims procedure.
The rules governing where an action should be started changed in July 1991,
to bring more claims within the cheaper, quicker and less formal small
claims procedure and to prevent trivial cases clogging up the High Court.
The Pounds 5,000 upper limit on the jurisdiction of the county court was
abolished and the court given unlimited jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of
the small claims court doubled to Pounds 1,000.
Cases are now allocated between the High Court and the county courts on a
simple formula basis. Cases involving sums up to Pounds 25,000 should start
in the county court as a matter of course. Cases between Pounds 25,000 and
Pounds 50,000 should normally start in the county court unless they are
complex or involve important questions of law and fact. Cases involving more
than Pounds 50,000 should automatically start in the High Court.
The High Court also has new powers to transfer cases to the county court
either where the case should have started there in the first place or where
it feels the case is straightforward enough to be heard at a lower level.
In practice, this means a number of cases involving more than Pounds 50,000
will be transferred down to the county court each year. Plaintiffs who
attempt to bring an action in the High Court which should have been started
in the county court risk having their case struck out.
Before these changes a huge volume of debt actions which should have been
started in the county court were brought in the High Court. Even in 1991,
the last year for which figures are available, 46 per cent of claims brought
in the High Court in London were for amounts below the old county court
jurisdiction limit of Pounds 5,000. Over 80 per cent of them were debt or
return of goods cases.
There were a number of reasons for the popularity of the High Court as
opposed to the county court in debt cases: the availability of the quick
summary judgment procedure; the perceived efficiency of the High Court
enforcement officers compared with county court bailiffs; and the
availability of remedies not available in the lower courts.
Along with the jurisdictional changes, however, the county courts now have
powers to make any orders which could have been made by the High Court if
the action had been brought there, although this does not extend to the
granting of Anton Piller orders and Mareva injunctions. (Mareva injunctions
are granted to prevent the transfer of assets and Anton Piller orders to
prevent destruction of documents.)
Creditors who are anxious to prevent debtor companies destroying assets or
transferring them abroad to avoid payment, therefore, may still wish to
commence their actions in the High Court.
For all practical purposes, however, the county court has become the focus
for debt actions. Actions are commenced in the county court by issue of a
summons and in the High Court by the issue of a writ of Fieri Facias
(Fi-Fa).
The procedure after a summons or writ is broadly the same. If the defendant
enters a defence the issue may go to trial.
County court cases involving sums up to Pounds 1,000 are dealt with by
district judges by way of arbitration under the small claims procedure
unless they are legally or factually complex. The arbitrations are informal
and do not adhere strictly to court procedures. Parties are encouraged to
handle small claims by themselves rather than being represented by a lawyer.
Legal aid is not available and normally the winning party cannot recover the
cost of legal representation from the loser.
Alternatively, the defendant may admit the claim and make an offer of
payment. If the creditor accepts the offer, judgment will be entered in his
favour. If he rejects it, a 'disposal hearing' will take place at which the
court will set the amount the defendant has to pay, and, if he is ordered to
pay by installments, the amount of each installment.
If the defendant fails to respond to the summons altogether the creditor can
obtain judgment in default without any examination of the merits of his
claim.
Where at least Pounds 10 is outstanding on a county court debt one month
after judgment the debt is recorded on the Register of County Court
judgments. Entries can be cancelled when a judgment is set aside or is paid
in full within one month. All entries are automatically removed after six
years. Entries on the register can affect a person's ability to get credit
in future and act as an incentive to pay off outstanding debts.
Once the plaintiff has obtained judgment in his favour and the debt has not
been paid he has a 'judgment debt' and can take immediate steps to enforce
it.
There are various methods of enforcing judgments in the county courts. The
most common, but one of the least effective, is the 'warrant of execution'
where the court orders an enforcement officer or bailiff to seize and sell
by public auction goods belonging to the debtor. Tools of a trade and
essential household items are exempt from seizure. The number of execution
warrants continues to rise in spite of evidence suggesting bailiffs rarely
recover goods sufficient to cover debts. In 1991 the last year for which
figures are available 1.47m execution warrants were issued, an increase of
10 per cent in 1990.
A creditor can obtain a charging order on a debtor's property, for example,
his house. If the debtor later sells the property the creditor is assured of
receiving some money. The number of applications for charging orders rose
from 34,970 in 1990 to 45,3672 in 1991.
Another common form of enforcement is attachment of earnings which obliges
the debtor's employer to deduct a set sum from the debtor's salary. The
number of orders made in 1991 rose to 54,508 from 48,118 in 1990.
A Garnishee order enables money owed to the debtor by a third party (the
garnishee), usually a bank or building society, to be held for the benefit
of the creditor. The Garnishee order is little used - only 6,380 were issued
in 1991.
An administration order allows a debtor with multiple debts not exceeding
Pounds 5,000 and at least one of which must be a judgment debt which he is
unable to pay immediately, to apply to discharge all his obligations by
making regular payments into court which are distributed among his creditors
on a pro rata basis. When such an order has been made creditors are
forbidden to take other enforcement measures without the specific authority
of the court.
Administration orders can be made on the application of the debtor, a
creditor, or by the court itself. The number granted rose by 43 per cent in
1991 to 8,496. Several changes to the administration order were made in the
1990 Courts and Legal Services Act. They include abolition of the Pounds
5,000 limit and need for at least one judgment debt, and the imposition of a
three year time limit on the order.
If the debtor cannot meet his debts in three years a composition order is
made reducing the overall level of debt he is expected to pay. These changes
have not yet come into force.
A large number of oral examinations designed to help creditors find the most
appropriate method of enforcing a judgment are held in the county court each
year. Although the oral examination is not a method of enforcement, the fact
that a debtor is ordered to attend court to provide details of income,
expenditure, employment and bank accounts often results in the debt being
paid. Applications for oral examinations increased by 15 per cent in 1991 to
122,084.
Methods of enforcement in the High Court include charging orders and
Garnishee orders and the appointment of a receiver to manage the judgment
debtor's property to protect the creditor's interest in it.
If all this fails, a person or company with debts he is unable to meet is
'bankrupt' or 'insolvent'. Creditors may issue a petition for bankruptcy
against individual debtors either in a designated county court but more
normally in the Chancery Division of the High Court.
Creditors may also petition for the winding-up of an insolvent company.
There is a restriction on proceedings which may be started in the county
court based on the paid-up capital of the company to be wound-up. Most
winding-up proceedings are brought in the High Court.
If no action is taken to recover a debt for six years it becomes statute
barred and no action can be taken.
Suppliers should maintain contact with defaulting customers to ensure this
does not happen.

CREDIT managers are looking for more from their computer services than mere
credit scoring in the 1990s. During the recession, they are more likely to
need help in assessing which bad debts are most likely to be repaid.
As in every other sphere of business, users are looking for software which
allows them to react more efficiently to change, create better control, and
make better decisions.
The truth about computers is they can only make the decisions they are
programmed to make. Even the all-seeing Hal in the film epic 2001 was
subject to that rule. Another truth is that, however comprehensive and
voluminous the data they store, it is only useful as information if it is
easily accessible.
As an application, credit management has followed the trend of computing in
general - mainframes, bureau services, then devolution to the in-house
minicomputer and ultimately, the PC. At the same time, the agenda has
changed for credit managers. They are looking for better and more responsive
control of existing data, often achieved by attaching a PC to feed from
mainframe-held data for sampling and testing.
Further, the trend is to extend the grasp of useful information at all
points of the credit cycle, not purely for credit scoring, before the loan
is made, but later, when things go wrong.
The last five years have seen growth and innovation in software for credit
management. There are now an increasing number of options, in controlling
different phases of the credit cycle, and in the hardware, PC and otherwise,
available to run them.
The first scoring techniques were developed about 20 years ago, pioneered by
Fair Isaac and Co. Computerised databases made it possible to store
statistics on which decisions about credit are based.
The system evaluates financial and non-financial characteristics of an
applicant, assigning points according to the answers. The scoring system is
defined by a table, derived from past experience.
For the first 10 years, the mainframe was the only practical option. The
main growth of credit scoring systems has been in the last 10 years,
particularly among mail order and retailing users. Fair Isaac have been
joined by other dominant suppliers, CCN, MDS and Mathtec, in installing
credit-scoring systems in UK banks, finance companies and other creditors,
particularly in the last five years. Bureau services are available from
Equifix, Scorex, and Infolink.
Now, power has come to the desktop for computer users in credit management.
At first sight, this is an application which needs more than PC power,
because of the volume of data involved, a problem overcome by linking to the
mainframe. Combined with the flexibility of fourth generation languages
(4GLs), they offer speed of reaction, because 4GLs can be used to develop
speedy prototypes and one-off experiments, and an ability to check and 'own'
the data.
'Bureaux always have problems in making the data flexible,' comments Jalal
Khoylou of Paragon Business Solutions, based in West London. 'There is
always some hassle with the format.' Paragon, founded by two ex-Infolink
employees, has developed a Decision Support System tailored to scorecard
modelling. Its aim is to help users through the complex business of building
the scorecard accurately. DSS is written in a 4GL, and is PC-based, using
graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for ease of use. According to Khoylou, the
process of developing a scorecard can cost up to Pounds 30,000 using outside
resources: for two scorecards, developed with in-house expertise, DSS is not
only a cheaper solution, but more flexible.
Extending the credit-scoring principle to debt recovery, SSI Nynex developed
its Debt Recovery System, now used, inter alia, in Marks &amp; Spencer Financial
Services, Girobank, and Diners Club. According to Andy Swain, an account
manager in debt recovery working for the London-based distributor of the
software, AST, the time has come for a more constructive role for computer
services than purely the timing and administration of litigation. 'What we
offer is a broader view of debt recovery. For as many as 250,000 accounts,
lenders are having to pay heavy fees trying to recover bad debts, through
structured payments or through outside debt collectors. With our system, we
can select the people most likely to pay by assessing the age, balance, and
other criteria.'
The two advantages of using the system are, he suggests, in speed of
reaction, and in establishing the recoverability of debts. This is
particularly important in deciding which accounts to take to legislation,
and which to allocate to agents. 'It's easier to control and monitor. The
better selection and targeting of accounts makes for improved cost per pound
recovered.'
The problem of bad debts plagues smaller companies as well as the large
institutional lenders. For the smaller companies, PC solutions are becoming
available to collect and control cash, and monitor debtors. C2 is a credit
management package from ACS, based in Rochester, providing daily reminders
and automatic documentation for debt recovery. Business Information
Technological Systems, of Ripon, North Yorks, provides a Credit Check
database, updated weekly by disk, which keeps a regular check on the
credit-worthiness of customers, suppliers, subcontractors, competitors, or
prospects, covering companies of all sizes.
Personal experience - the gut feel to distinguish between one who constantly
lives in the red and another who will not be so much as a day late paying
the bill - is not so easy to encapsulate as hard facts.
Nevertheless, credit management has often been held up as an example of
innovative use of so-called 'expert systems', in which human experience is
distilled in systems which aid decision-making, and can even automate some
of the processes of screening. These systems are based on a mixture of human
'gut feel' experience and statistical evidence. Nevertheless, they can never
make the decisions, they can only present a statistical 'likelihood' in any
given situation.
As with any area of computing, there is no such thing as the ultimate
answer. What there is, however, is an increasing potential for flexible
solutions.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (9): It began with a man called
Cuthbert - Insurance Protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
IN THE rapids of risk management, domestic credit insurance has been a
somewhat forgotten tributary, quietly providing some traders with cover
against losses due to insolvency or protracted default by the buyers of
their goods.
Credit insurance was invented at the turn of the century by Mr Cuthbert
Heath, the innovative underwriter who in the late 19th century steered
Lloyd's of London away from its exclusive concentration on insuring ships.
In 1936, however, the then ruling Committee of Lloyd's banned underwriters
from writing credit insurance, following concern over a fraud case in the
1920s which centred on imaginary Swedish buses and taxis and saw
underwriters liable for Pounds 367,000.
This left the field clear for Trade Indemnity, which still remains
overwhelmingly the market leader in domestic credit insurance, and of which
Mr Heath was a founding member in March 1918.
The domestic credit insurance market was worth Pounds 140m in 1992 and TI's
share was 82 per cent, according to Datamonitor, a market research firm. TI
believes it insures 15 per cent of all UK companies that could use credit
insurance.
In the same year Datamonitor estimated that Panfinancial, a conglomerate
formed by Japanese, Swedish and Finnish insurers in the early 1980s, had 9
per cent, with the Belgian company Namur accounting for 7 per cent.
NCM (UK), which first entered the market for domestic credit insurance in
April 1992, had only about 2 per cent of the UK's domestic credit insurance
but its presence is significant.
The Dutch private sector credit insurer is dominant in the UK export credit
insurance market. In 1992 NCM had 70 per cent of business worth Pounds 85m
following its purchase of the short-term business of the Export Credits
Guarantee Department in December 1991.
The Dutch insurer Aegon and the French insurer Assurances Generales de
France (AGF) have also established footholds in an industry experiencing a
period of fairly rapid change.
Mr Bryan Squibb, sales director of the specialist brokers, the Credit
Insurance Association (CIA), said: 'Things have changed dramatically. NCM is
pushing case-for-case against TI. Last year TI was forced to push up its
rates and that allowed NCM to go in and write a number of domestic policies.
The competition has forced everyone to respond with aggressive policies
which is great for customers.'
The growing number of insolvencies in the UK means the market is expanding
as more companies seek to buy policies. CIA says 'extensive' research it
commissioned from an independent agency indicates strong concerns about
credit risk and the risk of non-payment among medium and large companies.
Three out of four respondents were experiencing problems in obtaining
payment within agreed credit periods.
Twin benchmarks in the development of the industry were the failures of
Lowndes Queensway, the retail group, and Coloroll, the home furnishings
group, in the summer of 1990. Insured credit losses stemming from the
Coloroll collapse amounted to between Pounds 9m and Pounds 20m.
The other side of this picture is that in such parlous trading conditions
insurers face losses as claims increase.
In more buoyant times credit insurers are almost unique in the broader
insurance market because they routinely return profits on premium income
rather than relying on investments. This, and the potential for expansion in
the market, are perhaps both reasons that Lloyd's has been reconsidering its
credit insurance ban and why some large continental European insurers have
recently entered the market. Since 1990 European legislation has allowed
credit insurers limited freedom to trade across borders.
And technological innovation in the field is introducing new products which
can be cheaper and are available to smaller companies. In general customers
pay less than 1 per cent of turnover, depending on the sector they operate
in and how well they are judged to control credit risks.
The arrival in the industry of Infocheck's computerised on-line credit
insurance policies has, however, created a new product range, some of which
is specifically aimed at smaller companies.
The traditional 'whole turnover' credit insurance normally protects all
sales under a single policy. The policy provides the credit manager with
financial advice on all principal customers. Generally the insured will
self-insure an element of each credit limit. Indemnity is typically 80 to 85
per cent.
The risk posed by each buyer varies so the credit insurer may wish to vary
the credit limit. For this reason credit insurers stress the financial
advice and management side of their service. They say credit insurance is a
discipline on, and a back-up to, credit control. Many companies put their
futures at risk because they are unaware that their credit may be up to 40
per cent of their current assets, they say.
The other main traditional type of policy is excess of loss or 'catastrophe'
insurance. The insured will agree a 'first loss' or non qualifying loss
designed to eliminate predictable lower level losses. A very large 'layer'
of cover is then purchased in excess of this self insured proportion.
In 1991 Infocheck began offering computerised variations of these
traditional products and others under two credit insurance policies, both
underwritten by AMA Underwriting Agencies. These are both essentially
spin-offs from their UK business information database. One of the policies
is aimed at companies with insurable turnover of more than Pounds 2m and the
other at those falling under that limit.
Once the policy is in place the customer can access Infocheck's on-line
information system and extract information about buyers. At the end of the
information a credit limit is presented and the customer asked to accept or
reject it. If the customer accepts it coverage is immediate.
This was initially dismissed by more established players in the market as
crude compared with their traditional bespoke approach which depends on the
specialist experience of underwriters who consider each customer
individually. It is understood, however, that most of the big companies are
now considering similar on-line facilities.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (8): Rat-catcher syndrome -
Andrew Jack on debt-chasers' image problem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIMES MAY be tough for companies and individuals who owe money, but the debt
collection industry claims that they are no more pleasant for it either as a
result of the UK's prolonged recession.
'We had a record year,' says Mr David Baber, chairman and managing director
of Credit Protection Association. Turnover in 1992 was up 40 per cent to
Pounds 7m, and profits stood at Pounds 3.2m.
Intrum Justitia, the Swedish-based debt collection group which claims to be
the biggest in Europe and possibly the world, says profits rose by more than
a third last year to Pounds 11.6m, on turnover up by nearly a half to Pounds
75m.
Mr Baber says that his company has more than 4,000 regular customers on its
books seeking to recover unpaid bills, and a further 6,000 who pay on an ad
hoc basis. 'On any day we could be sending out 1,500 letters,' he says. 'We
have about 2,000 cases at some stage of legal action with a solicitor
retained.'
Yet the industry claims that the recession has not been good news. 'There's
a lot less meat on the bone,' says Mr Larry Lewis, chairman and joint
managing director of the Lewis Group. 'We have to work harder in a
recession.' That is in spite of his company's 1992 increase in profits to
Pounds 720,000 from Pounds 243,000 in the previous year.
The argument is that both consumers and companies have become much more
reluctant to pay their debts during the recession. Consumer spending has
declined in response to the downturn, reducing the size of the market.
At the same time, companies which are owed money have increasingly brought
their debt recovery work in-house rather than contracting it out. They have
turned to other solutions to outstanding debts such as factoring. There has
also been a sharp increase in competition.
Traditionally, solicitors did not want to be associated with debt recovery.
Now, some argue, the collapse of the conveyancing monopoly and of the
housing market has forced firms to turn to new areas. They have been aided
by new computer systems and the relaxation of restrictions of advertising.
Indeed, one recent survey showed that lawyers accounted for four-fifths of
the advertisements in a trade journal for debt collection services.
The hard-nosed attitudes and the stigmatised image of the industry remain.
Call many of the UK's debt collection groups and it is difficult to get past
the tenacious operator who answers the phone, let alone get through to speak
to the managing director.
'The general reputation in the UK is appalling,' says Mr Jan Erik Paulden,
group communications manager at Intrum Justitia. 'You only have to go to a
party and tell people what you do and see the reaction.'
The negative attitudes are partly a function of the many hundreds of
localised door-to-door collectors around the country, who are often paid on
commission and may apply less than scrupulous methods to help aid
recoveries.
There are also the scare stories of knee-cappers with even more ruthless
means. 'Some probably does go on,' says Mr Baber. 'Some very large people
certainly come round to our offices from time to time offering their
services.'
New causes for concern include access to sensitive personal data, which the
collectors can use to make assessments of individuals' and companies'
ability to pay.
Generally, the negativity relates to the perceived profits derived from an
unpleasant act, of course. Mr Mike Scully, secretary of the Credit Services
Association, says: 'There is still this negative image. There are people on
the fringes but this is quite a sophisticated business. I think we are
necessary - evil is too strong a word - but we are necessary, like rat
catchers. We are really like doctors faced with the plague. You can't cure
all the patients.'
Mr Scully says that his association does have the power to dismiss or
reprimand members, although it has never done so. He says he receives about
two to three calls of complaint a month, many of which are trivial and many
which refer to allegations against firms which are not members.
Intrum would like to see more government-inspired regulation of the
industry. It helped support the association, and has its own strict code of
ethics. It has also embarked on an ambitious marketing campaign with the
themes of prompt payment and civility, using the slogan 'Pay fair  ..
please.' In common with a number of the larger agencies, many of its staff
are women, who are seen to be less confrontational.
One of practitioners' biggest gripes is the slowness of the county court
system for pursuing actions to recover debt. That helps explain why it is
negotiating with the Lord Chancellor's Office for its members to be able to
represent clients directly in court.
The structure and future shape of debt collection is changing fast. Mr Lewis
points particularly to the expanding use of technology. His company is about
to begin using sophisticated 'predictive dialling' equipment. This
automatically makes telephone calls to those being pursued, and filters out
those whose numbers are unobtainable.
He says that leaves his staff far more time to speak to those who are
contactable, and estimates that it helps increase the response rate from six
to nine calls an hour up to about 35.
Computer equipment is also boosting the ease of issuing summonses through
the courts.
Now more advanced software is helping in a wide variety of ways including
credit-rating, gathering information and tracking down people and companies.
Clients are able to shift bulk bad debt information rapidly and directly
between their own computers and those of the debt collection agencies.
Meanwhile, the debt recoverers are increasingly trying to encourage clients
to employ them at an earlier stage. That has substantial cash flow
advantages and offers a more regular all-in fee rather than a
commission-based structure.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (7): A pernicious symptom of
recession - Slower payment is adding to industry's heavy burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE man's meat is another man's poison. Directors of big, publicly quoted
companies might reflect on this if they boast about their cash management
achievements during the current financial reporting season.
Reduced working capital is achievable in a number of ways including better
stock control. But as every company accounts department knows, one of the
crudest, if most effective, methods is to chase up customer debtors and keep
supplier creditors at bay.
The problem of late payment always surfaces during a recession - when money
is tight and banks are twitchy - and the economic downturn of the early
1990s has been no exception.
All companies suffer but small businesses with limited resources definitely
bear the brunt. Legislation is planned which will force businesses of a
certain size to state publicly in their annual accounts how long it takes
them to pay their bills. But there are growing calls for tougher action,
including compulsory financial penalties for offenders.
All the recent evidence suggests that the recession is lengthening payment
delays. The Association of British Factors and Discounters says that the
time taken for European companies to pay their debts increased on average by
one third in 1992. Even in Germany, payment periods have widened from 30 to
around 50 days.
Trade Indemnity, the UK credit insurer, showed in a survey published last
month that only 3 per cent of 600 companies polled in December were being
paid on time.
The additional cost of interest on borrowed money (or loss of interest for
companies in the black) obviously feeds through to lower trading margins.
Creditors without a formal funding facility, of course, will suffer bigger
penalties so that profitable companies can run into serious cash flow
difficulties.
On top of this the cost of systems and resources allocated to address
overdue debt should not be forgotten; nor can the VAT effects of late
payment be overlooked. Businesses are often paying output VAT before the
money has been received from customers, thus leading to a further cost
of/loss of interest.
All in all late payment could amount to 3 to 5 per cent of operating costs -
a significant number in today's tough market conditions. German experience
may indeed be worsening - but given that the annual average payment delay in
the UK is more like 78 days what is happening elsewhere is of more than
academic interest. The average collection period in the US is 54 days.
The Deparment of Trade and Industry has issued a payments procedure. And the
Confederation of British Industry, which says that late payment threatens
the survival of one in five of its members, has a 'prompt payers' code. Only
400 businesses out of the 250,000 members have signed up though the list
includes Esso, Boots, British Airways and Glaxo.
The Government's disclosure plan - which should be in force by the end of
the year - is the first legally binding initiative in the late payments
area. The hope is that large companies will be embarrassed to admit to bad
practice, and will therefore be shamed into pulling up their socks. The
rights of redress for an injured party have always been available through
the Sale of Goods Act - but many smaller suppliers are reluctant to cause a
fuss for fear of losing out on future business.
Mr Kerry McKevitt, a director of UCMCL, Beaconsfield-based credit
consultants, regrets that the legislation does not go further. 'It is
unfortunate that it does not include the statutory requirement of all
companies to disclose both their collection days and their payment days, to
enable direct comparison,' he says. 'If, for example, a company showed it
collected its debts in 45 days there would be little moral justification for
paying its creditors in 65 days - the difference equating to an additional
20 days financing from its creditors.'
Many small business lobbyists - such as the Forum for Private Business  -
believe there should be a statutory right to interest on overdue payments.
All EC member states - except Britain and Ireland - have such a legal right
but according to the European Commission there is no conclusive evidence
that this improves the situation.
McKevitt suggests that rather than compulsorily debiting offending companies
it may be better for the interest at least to be separately accounted for by
businesses. This would provide the DTI with evidence of the cost and effect
of late payment to industry - and enable the Department to take better
remedial action in future.
McKevitt acknowledges the administrative complexities of such schemes, but
he claims the introduction of statutory interest in Germany has been
beneficial for investment.
The idea of a prompt payment standard - or kitemark - has recently been
floated by the Institute of Credit Management which has approached both the
British Standards Institution and the government for a response.
The institute's original plan was for a prompt payment clause to be added to
BS5750, a quality management standard which has won widespread acceptance.
But this was rejected by the BSI.
The proposed kitemark would commit companies to paying their bills by the
date stipulated in the agreed terms.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (5): Fingers on the pulse -
Factors and discounters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE factors and invoice discounters believe that the economic upturn, when
it comes, will be their golden opportunity for growth. Not just because
increased economic activity will boost business but because the banks,
chastened by their losses during the recession, will be very cautious with
their lending.
The factors, too, have had to absorb losses. But because they monitor their
clients' performance far more closely than the bank manager does his, they
are in a better position to spot when a company is running into trouble.
The factors themselves have been advancing this argument for many years but
there are now signs that the banks, which own most of the larger factoring
companies, are realising this too. In an appeal for closer cooperation
between the banks, government and small business launched last month, Mr
Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland Bank, suggested that the banks
should widen their use of factoring and invoice discounting to help
businesses recover from the recession.
Although the banks own most of the large factoring companies, the
relationship between the main branch networks and the factoring divisions
has been uneasy. Many bank managers have regarded factoring as only suitable
for their less creditworthy customers. The factors for their part have
welcomed business which came to them by means of the branch network but have
been reluctant to become too dependent on it.
Factoring involves a company handing over the management of its sales ledger
to the factor in return for an immediate advance of up to 80 per cent of the
value of its invoices. This represents a far more generous valuation of
trade debts than the 35-50 per cent most bank managers would allow and can
lead to a dramatic improvement in the company's cash flow. The factor
monitors when his client's customers settle their bills and can warn of
impending difficulties.
Factoring is typically used by the smaller company which has not yet
developed a sophisticated system of managing its sales ledger. For the
larger company, with more highly developed credit management system, invoice
discounting is more appropriate. The invoice discounter provides cash
against invoices but the client retains control of his sales ledger.
Although concrete proof of the upturn has yet to come through there are
already signs of an increase in factoring volumes. Sales financed by the
UK's 11 largest factors rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 16bn in 1992 compared
with a rise of only 2.5 per cent the year before, according to the
Association of British Factors and Discounters (ABFD). The number of
companies using factoring increased by 7 per cent to 9,221.
'We must be the only business financing sector which can point to growth,'
comments Mr Alan Hughes, chairman of the ABFD and managing director of
Griffin Factors (part of Midland Bank).
Domestic factoring rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 5.6bn while invoice
discounting increased by double that rate to Pounds 9.7bn. In spite of the
imminent creation of the single European market and publicity given to the
importance of overseas trade, import and export factoring continued to be
the laggard of the industry, rising just 7 per cent to Pounds 643m. An
encouraging development was a 1 per cent fall in bad debts absorbed by UK
factors to Pounds 13.1m - the first drop in six years.
One niche where factoring has established itself is in the financing of
management buy-outs and venture capital deals. More than 10 per cent of the
Pounds 3bn of finance advanced by factors and invoice discounters over the
past two years has been linked to venture capital transactions, the ABFD
calculates.
Increased enthusiasm on the part of senior bankers for factoring and the
effects of an intensive marketing campaign over the past four years by the
industry may succeed in breaking down residual resistance to it as a method
of finance.
For some business owners and managers, factoring retains an image as being a
slightly unsavoury form of finance suitable only for companies about to
fold. Even ownership of the main factors by the banks has not succeeded
entirely in erasing this impression, which dates from irresponsible
factoring activities as far back as the 1960s.
A continuing problem for the industry is a perception among many businesses
that it is an expensive way of raising money. Apart from typically paying 3
per cent above bank base rate for the cash provided against invoices, a
company would also pay between 0.75 and 3 per cent of turnover for the
factoring service. Invoice discounting, which does not involve so much work
on the part of the factor/invoice discounter, can cost between 0.1 and 1 per
cent of turnover.
For companies working on very narrow margins the cost of the service could
prove a deterrent. For others, the factors argue, the savings achieved on
the cost of running a sales ledger department and from being paid more
promptly, more than outweigh the costs.
Now that all the large UK banks have their factoring arms there has been
little change among the bigger players over the past year or so. Lloyds Bank
has two separate factoring divisions, Alex Lawrie and International Factors.
Barclays has Barclays Commercial Services, National Westminster has Lombard
NatWest Commercial Services while Midland has Griffin.
The past year has seen some changes among the smaller players, however. AIB
Commercial Finance, part of the Irish AIB banking group, withdrew from
invoice discounting at the end of 1992 after failing to achieve the scale of
business it had hoped for. Kellock, a Bank of Scotland subsidiary, took on
the continuing business in AIB's portfolio.
Venture Factors, which had been owned by the United Bank of Kuwait, was
acquired in mid-1992 by IFN Factors, part of the Dutch ABN Amro Bank group.
This made it the second Dutch-owned factor/invoice discounter in the UK
alongside De Lage Landen, which is owned by Rabobank. Venture Factors plans
to concentrate on providing invoice discounting to the UK subsidiaries of
continental European companies, says Mr Tony Cox, managing director.
A third development in the industry was the expansion of Causeway Invoice
Discounting into factoring through the purchase of Finance for Business
(Europe), a private company owned by a group of individual investors in the
north west of England. 'By offering only invoice discounting we were
precluded from doing business with quite a lot of companies which were
fundable but where the administration and sales ledger management left
something to be desired,' says Mr Brian Sumner, managing director.
Causeway's move represents an intriguing development following several years
in which invoice discounting has been the fastest growth sector.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (6): From the depths of the
slump - Catherine Milton hears about the travails of a private mortgage
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICHARD ANDERSON is head of underwriting at the Household Mortgage
Corporation, the privately-owned residential mortgage company. During 1990
he regularly consulted a 'knowledge' engineer about his job.
He was not suffering from brain strain. The discussions he had were part of
the company's attempt to speed up its underwriting but maintain consistency
through automation.
The company, which is roughly the same size (in terms of assets) as the
Chelsea Building Society, 12th or 13th largest in the UK, has traded through
the housing slump, serving about 35,000 customers with about Pounds 2bn
worth of business on its books.
HMC last year announced bad debt provisions of Pounds 4.16m for the year to
end-March 1991, sharply up from Pounds 2.2m the previous year. This was
relatively modest compared with other lenders. Its pre-tax profits had more
than doubled in the year to March 1991 from Pounds 2.21m to Pounds 5.16m.
The company says it identified four priorities in the 1980s as the need to
maintain:
the quality of its loan book in a difficult market;
protection against fraud through scrutiny of applications;
fast turnaround of mortgage applications - generally within 24 hours;
current staff levels to handle a larger volume of applications when the
market recovers.
Automation seemed the logical route. HMC turned to Infolink Decision
Services, one of the UK's four main suppliers and designers of credit
scoring systems.
A report into credit scoring published last year by the Office of Fair
Trading found that the number of lenders using some form of credit scoring
system in the UK has grown recently.
The OFT said: 'Credit scoring is now an established and integral part of the
procedures of much of the credit industry. Credit scoring is used
extensively by many if not all the major lenders in banks, credit and charge
card issuers, finance houses, building societies, retailers, mail order
companies and direct selling companies as well as other lenders.'
Mr Anderson says: 'We wanted the computer to do what underwriters have
always done manually. For example, we wanted it to check the distance
between a person's place of work and the property. There may be a very good
reason why someone who gives a work address in the North of Scotland is
buying in the South East of England, but it is unusual.'
The company believed a computer could reach a level of consistency in
underwriting which would normally take the combined efforts of several
people to achieve.
The computer would also leave underwriters free to attend to less
straightforward applications where judgment is important.
This consistency is a main element in detecting fraud, but the system is
also designed to deter fraudsters. Mr Anderson says: 'There is a certain
amount of shouting-from-the-tree-tops. We want people who are considering
these kinds of frauds to know that their chances of success at HMC are
slim.'
But HMC wanted a system capable of producing a report which would allow
underwriters to see clearly how the computer had arrived at its conclusion
and investigate as appropriate rather than simply scoring applications.
It was at this point that Infolink sent in the knowledge engineer. This was
to try and identify the values behind HMC's underwriting decisions.
Mr Anderson says: 'The psychologist was sent in to try and understand the
way we underwrite. We will deal with a loan application and we will look at
certain facets of that application. 'We had to give examples of what we
would and would not accept and the relative importance of different factors
in that decision.' Infolink studied the risk weighting HMC gave factors such
as income, age and employment history, for each particular product. It also
looked at cases which had been declined and the performance of those which
had been accepted.
Today, as each application form arrives at HMC, the operator will type in
the name and address, which triggers a credit reference request. By the time
the operator has finished inputting details, the credit reference will have
been returned and will be weighted. An assessment breakdown form - based on
the scrutiny of more than 100 factors - is then produced for underwriters to
check.
The procedure usually takes about 10 minutes. The old manual system took an
average of two hours assuming no distractions from colleagues or telephone
calls.
Mr Anderson insists that the system has no flaws, although he admits to
having dotted a few i's and crossed a few t's in the early stages after
installation. The company is equally silent about the cost of the system.
The OFT described cost of such systems as 'substantial' and requiring a
volume of business for the increased efficiency generated by its use to
offset the cost within the life of the system.
Mr Anderson said: 'You are not talking about a Pounds 10,000 system. But it
has already picked up a couple of cases of what we believe to be attempted
fraud.'
The company is also anxious to stamp on the idea that automation could lead
to job losses. HMC has not reduced staff numbers since installation of the
system, although some staff have been moved into customer services, to deal
with the darker side of HMC's credit management - arrears management.
Mr Geoff Wagland, HMC's corporate affairs manager, says arrears management
is one area in which computers are unlikely to make much of an increased
contribution: 'This is where the customer services element really comes into
its own. This is where you need people, although computers can help.'
All mortgage repayments are made to HMC by direct debit and the company will
let customers know the debit has not been honoured before their bank does:
'We will get on to a customer in difficulties very, very quickly so as to
work out a solution that works for both parties.'
He says: 'If you have got it right in the first instance then customers
don't get into difficulties without a good reason.' That is why his company
puts such emphasis on underwriting quality and its computerised credit
system.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (2): Know your customer - Credit
rating is an industry in its own right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE business information market has expanded significantly over the past
decade. New players have emerged to challenge the old-established groups and
the demand for ever-faster credit decisions has both pushed and been pushed
by rapid technological change.
At the same time, only a tiny percentage of commercial sales decisions are
taken on the basis of information provided by an outside credit rating
agency. The challenge for the industry is two-fold: to convince more
businesses of the need for properly informed sales decisions and to refine
the technology to make this possible.
'Credit vetting should start at the sales stage,' says Mr Philip Mellor,
marketing manager of Dun &amp; Bradstreet International (D&amp;B), which claims to
be the largest provider of business information in the UK. 'The sales force
will become disillusioned if it takes an order which is not accepted by the
credit control department. Consider that the average cost of a sales call is
Pounds 150.'
'A credit control policy should enable the sales people to concentrate on
customers who will be the most profitable,' says Mr Brian Bailey, managing
director of UAPT-Infolink. 'Yet often this is hampered by a conflict between
the sales director and the finance director.'
If these barriers can be broken down the potential for the business
information providers is enormous. Only one in 15 commercial sales decisions
is taken with help of 'third party' information, calculates Mr Mellor. Mr
Bailey puts the figure at 'a few percent'.
The reason for this reluctance may lie in the availability of business
information in the UK from one central source, Companies House. Compare this
with continental Europe where company information is often lodged with local
chambers of commerce or even the US, where relatively few companies - 17,000
against 900,000 in the UK - are required to file returns.
But the value of this information may be more apparent than real, the
business information groups claim. Companies House data can be up to 15
months out of date. In boom times, let alone a recession, this delay can
conceal payment problems at a company.
Fortunately for the credit rating industry demand for credit information
comes not just from the corporate end-user but from a host of
intermediaries, financial groups such as finance and leasing companies,
factors and the credit insurers. Although they collect a great deal of
information themselves they provide a ready market for the services of the
information companies.
The task for the information provider is to collect the published
information available - company reports, county court judgments, directors'
disqualifications - and to supplement this with unpublished information on
the past payments performance of companies and individuals. Where the
information companies add value is in bringing this disparate information
together in a single credit report and, even more important, interpreting it
for their customers.
It has been in the market for consumer information where the most rapid
growth occurred during the 1980s. Increasing affluence led to a rise in the
purchase, on credit, of expensive consumer durables such as video players,
cars and boats. At the same time the deregulation of financial markets meant
that many more financial products, also involving long-term financial
commitments on the part of the purchaser, became available.
Unlike the commercial sector there was often very little information
available on the ability of the private individual to meet his credit
commitments. And whereas a supplier could take security on the assets of a
company or the personal assets of its directors there was less security
available when granting credit to a private individual.
Some of the information providers have their origins in serving the consumer
market, providing information to mail order houses, for example, while
others come from a commercial background. As time has gone by commercial
pressures have forced the larger groups to provide both sorts of
information, either by collecting it themselves or by establishing links
with companies which could fill the gaps in their portfolio.
There are considerable benefits from being able to provide both commercial
and consumer information, says UAPT-Infolink's Mr Bailey. 'With new
companies which do not have a trading record it is important to be able to
flip over into our personal database with information on directors.'
UAPT-Infolink claims to be the oldest UK credit information organisation,
tracing its origins back to 1842 and the foundation of the London
Association for the Protection of Trade, a mutual association of traders to
exchange information about their customers. Amalgamations turned the London
association into a united association or UAPT in 1965.
The other main players in the business information market have also
broadened their scope. D&amp;B has established links with Equifax Europe (UK), a
consumer information group, while CCN which started out providing consumer
information, now offers commercial information services. ICC Information
Group specialised at an early stage in the financial analysis of companies
and industry sectors and still provides a range of City-oriented services
but it too offers credit checking information.
The information collected by these organisations is available in many forms,
in hard copy, print, by post, telephone, fax, viewdata or computer link-up.
Increasingly information is required immediately to permit a sales decision,
so on-line services have grown in importance.
Customers with a heavy demand for information may take out a subscription
while those with only intermittent need for information may buy one-off
reports. Some customers may require a detailed financial report while others
may make do with a quick credit assessment. 'We have a modular system which
allows us to carry out checks to different levels of detail depending on the
risk,' says Mr Kevin Still, marketing manager of UAPT-Infolink.
Some of the information groups provide a written summary of the company
being assessed while others have devised short-hand codes to convey a credit
rating.
The result of all this work on compilation and analysis has been to make
information much more readily available to a broad range of users. 'The
small firm can now exploit information which would have only been available
to the bigger company 10 years ago,' says Mr Bruno Tavernier, a director of
ICC.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (3): Brinkmanship is not enough
 -Guide to procedure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SHEILA JONES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BORROWING dulls the edge of husbandry, and lending is fraught with risk too.
But Polonius was only half right when he warned against both.
Good credit management is about following rules. It is not expensive or
complicated. Nor should it stifle a company's wish to be creative and
flexible, within limits. It can allow a company to borrow and lend, oil the
wheels of the business, and emerge unscathed.
Striking a balance might seem hard: go easy on creditors and you could be
taken for a mug. Hire a couple of heavies to pick up a debt, and you may
lose a valued customer. Pay your bills late too often and you will get a bad
name, and risk losing discounts and after sales service.
Essentials for a credit manager are persuasion skills and brinkmanship, says
Mr Burt Edwards, fellow of the Institute of Credit Management. You must
press for payment according to agreed terms, but must back off if there is a
genuine dispute
If you are about to start up, seek expert advice on the law and best trade
practice. But there are rules any company can follow to improve internal
procedures.
The Confederation of British Industry offers the following guidelines to
improve credit management:
have a written contract, stating your terms and conditions. In particular,
it should give clear terms of payment, agreed and understood before you
trade. Payment periods should be compatible with cashflow.
check creditworthiness. Limit risk by running a customer through credit
rating agencies. 'No-one in their right mind would buy a house without a
survey,' says Dr Ian Peters, a CBI deputy director.
personal contacts. Get to know the people in the accounts or sales
departments. Know who to speak to if payment or delivery is late.
employ someone solely responsible for credit management. 'It is the
Cinderella of small business management,' says Dr Peters. 'Yet it can make
or break a company. It is at the heart of business survival but it is often
seen as a clerk's job.'
set down a time limit for payment beyond which you cannot go. If a buyer
wants terms which your company cannot finance, say No. 'A good manager knows
how far the company can go in being flexible,' says Dr Peters. 'But it is
important to set out the parameters.' have a clear and consistent system for
chasing payment. It might go like this: a reminder is sent out,
automatically, the day after a payment date has passed. Further written
reminders may follow although it is probably better to get on the phone if
no payment is made after repeated reminders. Telephone the company or go in
person. If payment is still not made, it may then be appropriate to send a
solicitor's letter, threatening court action. Do not be reluctant about
recourse to the law, but use your judgment on when it is appropriate.
procedures between customers and suppliers should be compatible. Most large
companies use a computer system and standard invoices. Quote reference and
order numbers. Get the numbers right, address invoices correctly and send
them to the right person.
A company might benefit from handing over credit management to someone else,
such as a factor. 'This can speed up payment and provide security,' says Dr
Peters. But you should consider the cost and whether it is appropriate. 'If
your supply network is straightforward you probably don't need one, but you
might if you're in a tricky area. The cost of factoring could be a price
worth paying for peace of mind.'
Much depends on consistency, thoroughness and an understanding of when to be
flexible. Beyond this, you should know something about business law.
Few companies bother to draw up detailed terms and conditions, fewer still
read them, but they can put you ahead of the game.
First, ensure that your terms and conditions apply, says Mr Simon Rawlins of
London solicitors Baileys Shaw &amp; Gillett.
Terms and conditions must be incorporated into the contract at the outset
when agreeing an order, otherwise you will be unable to make any of your
terms stick in a dispute. If you are agreeing a deal by telephone,
specifically mention that the contract is subject to your terms. Confirm
this by sending an acknowledgement of the order with your terms on the back.
A few well-chosen clauses could help to improve your legal position. Mr
Rawlins suggests the following:
retention of title. This means the seller retains legal ownership of the
goods until they are paid for. It will help get your goods back if a
customer goes into receivership.
limit your liability. In the unlikely event of your goods proving to be
defective, your liability should not be open-ended.
allow flexibility in your delivery dates. A clause could set out, for
example, that you are entitled to deliver on the agreed date, or in seven
days.
interest provision. Include a charge for interest on late payment. 'It is
worth having the option to charge interest even if you do not always use
it,' says Mr Rawlins.
Mr Rawlins's final tip on legal protection: keep written notes of all stages
of a contract, including phone conversations. 'Courts like pieces of paper.
If a dispute arises, a court will want to know whether there is any evidence
in writing which you can point to to support your case. If you do, you have
a much greater chance of judgment in your favour.' And it could greatly
speed settlement.
'It is getting the simple things right every time,' says Mr Rawlins. 'Have a
credit policy, have a set of terms and conditions, know when and how to
incorporate them into a contract and ducument your transactions as well as
possible. Beyond that, everything else is a commercial risk, but getting all
that right will keep the risk to acceptable levels.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (4): Where the whip is cracked -
Andrew Jack examines the changing role of Companies House
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE last Friday in January this year, Companies House, the government's
corporate information agency, had a bumper delivery of mail: the equivalent
of nine normal days' worth. On Saturday it had two days' deliveries. On
Sunday, couriers brought another four sacks.
A few months ago, such enthusiasm would have been implausible. But the
timing marked the end of the period in which accounts from the many
companies incorporated in March are required to be filed. More important, it
was just half a year since the agency launched its crackdown on companies
failing to make their filings within the legal timescale.
That is just one example of how Companies House has begun to change, from a
statutory nuisance which was largely ignored into an aggressive,
commercially-oriented agency being used increasingly by businesses and
individuals seeking a growing range of corporate information.
One accountant who files hundreds of company accounts each year says the
change has been enormous. 'You could get away with murder in the past,' he
says. 'You felt unlucky if they traced you for not filing on time. We used
all the old excuses which allowed us to stall for months on end, saying the
director was out of the country and that we couldn't get a signature.'
Many companies were reluctant to file, since they did not want people to be
aware of their financial position. Others simply did not give priority to
completing the accounts of many of their subsidiaries. Whatever the excuse,
those that are tardy now face substantial fines and even the prospect of a
criminal record if they do not comply.
The new regime has not been introduced without difficulties. In the latest
of a long line of complainants, the president of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales wrote to the Prime Minister earlier this
year concerning the pedantic interpretation of the time limit for filing -
which is seven months for public companies and 10 months for others. If a
private company's year-end is February 28, for instance, it must file by
December 28 that year, not December 31.
But Mr David Durham, the agency's chief executive, is unrepentant. 'There
are people who if you give them an inch will take a foot,' he says. 'You may
say it's bureaucratic, but this way everyone has a very clear mandate to
work to.' The new approach has certainly been impressive. He says that 82
per cent of accounts and annual returns are now made on time, against 68 per
cent a year ago and 40 per cent in the mid 1980s. For accounts alone, timely
returns are now running at 91 per cent.
The mere fact that these performance figures are available so readily
indicates something of the changes taking place. 'It used to be that if I
had a query and called up three people at Companies House, I got three
different answers,' says one large user. 'Now we are seeing the sort of
service the public should be entitled to.'
That partly reflects the greater autonomy now placed on officials at the
agency, based in Cardiff. Formally it is still part of the Department of
Trade and Industry. But it became the second executive agency under the
government's Next Steps initiative in 1988. In 1991, it became a trading
agency, giving it even greater managerial and financial independence and
effective ownership of its assets.
Mr Durham's comments are peppered with concerns to provide what the consumer
wants. There is an emphasis on user groups and new publications. A few years
ago, users of company information had to present themselves physically at
the offices to obtain data. Now they can order fiches by phone, get some
information by computer and even have searches faxed to them at a premium
rate.
Substantial further change is still in the offing. This summer should bring
the introduction of two new services: a computerised directors' register -
accessible by name rather than simply by company - and a mortgage register,
both priced at below the standard Pounds 3 basic company search fee.
In the longer-term, there are proposals for electronic filing of company
returns. Wider requests under consideration include access to information by
VAT numbers.
But a dark cloud of uncertainty also hangs over the future of the service,
which is making future planning extremely difficult. Mr Michael Heseltine,
the trade and industry secretary, announced a review of Companies House last
summer which could lead to full or partial privatisation.
The conclusions are expected soon, and will be watched very closely. Staff
are worried about their jobs, and senior managers about their roles and
responsibilities. Rival company agents who process Companies House
information are concerned about fair competition. Many users question the
role of the private sector in collecting and storing statutory information.
Meanwhile, users continue to express some disappointment about aspects of
the service. Not least among their gripes is the recent decision to cancel a
huge computerisation project which would have permitted far quicker capture
and recovery of information, and might have allowed documents to be
electronically read.
They also say that insufficient scrutiny goes into the filing of returns, so
that many have omissions such as failing to show the registered office or
the names and addresses of all directors.
More generally, Companies House sees its role as essentially clerical: to
receive, store and retrieve basic corporate information, while examining for
only the most cursory mistakes. No one in Cardiff, nor in the Department of
Trade and Industry in London, seems to look at accounts in detail to ensure
compliance with accounting standards or wider regulatory issues, or to
investigate concerns highlighted in auditors' reports.
That said, David Durham argues that the UK still provides one of the most
efficient sources of company information in Europe.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Survey of Credit Management (1): In the teeth of the gale -
The avalanche of bankruptcies, many caused by mismanaged cash flows, and the
tenuous state of company finances have dramatised the need for better credit
controls by borrowers and lenders. They have also fuelled demands for
legislation to penalise late payers
</HEADLINE>

CREDIT management has traditionally been seen as an unglamorous, back-office
job. While the sales team got the expense account lunches and the smart
cars, the credit controller ate in the canteen and went home by bus.
Until the onset of the recession, that is. Spiralling failure rates,
ever-lengthening payments delays and a crunch on company cash flows have
brought home the importance of efficient credit management. Ineffective
credit controls have meant that many otherwise viable businesses have gone
to the wall.
The old excuses for not taking action to reduce credit risk have been
discredited, says Ms Barbara Bennett, corporate affairs manager at Trade
Indemnity, Britain's largest insurer of domestic trade credit.
Among the famous last words of doomed businessmen she lists: 'All my clients
are blue chip' and 'I have known the company for 20 years. I was playing
golf with the managing director only last week.'
The credit management sector has two main elements: the in-house credit
controller who attempts to ensure the company only does business with
customers who can pay on time; and the external suppliers of credit
services. These include the business information providers which credit rate
companies, the factors, the credit insurance groups and the debt-collection
agencies.
Companies in Britain employ about 80,000 credit controllers or managers,
calculates Mr Peter Allen, chairman of the Institute of Credit Management.
But there is often no career structure and their status in many companies is
low.
'Many senior managers are reluctant to employ a specialist,' says Mr Allen.
'This is despite the fact that the person in charge of the debtor ledger
typically is in charge of 40 per cent of the business's current assets, more
than anyone else in the company apart from the managing director.'
To boost standards the institute, which has 8,000 members, runs training
programmes around the country and plans to move to a system of exam-only
entry.
A more professional approach to credit management is the only way to improve
the payments position of British companies, says Mr Peter Rowe, the
institute's director general. The welter of proposals which have been made
to ensure that companies, particularly small businesses, get paid on time
will not solve the problem, he believes.
One proposal, so far rejected by the government, is for legislation to give
companies a statutory right to interest on unpaid bills. This idea has the
backing of the Forum of Private Business, a small business lobby group, Dun
&amp; Bradstreet, a business information group and Intrum Justitia, a debt
collection agency.
But others, the institute included, believe it would be unduly complex to
administer and unlikely to make a difference to companies which did not wish
to offend their customers.
The government has responded by financing three pilot projects run by a
chamber of commerce and two trade associations to establish 'model'
procedures for speeding up payments. It has also streamlined county court
procedures for collecting debt. The improvements include dispensing with
preliminary hearings in all but exceptional cases, allowing judges to help
litigants who are not legally represented and requiring judges to explain
their decisions orally.
Another move by government is to require large companies to declare in their
annual report the time it takes them to pay their suppliers. The government
has published a consultation paper aimed at finding the most acceptable
method of providing this information. But many finance directors and
accountants are sceptical that the numbers would be meaningful unless the
average contractual payment terms agreed by individual companies and by the
industry sector were also published.
A separate initiative has also been taken by the Confederation of British
Industry. More than 400 CBI members have signed up to a register of
companies which guarantee to make prompt payments. The code has been
criticised as depending on the goodwill of participants and for lacking real
teeth.
The institute, for its part, has suggested that payments performance should
be one of the areas included in BS5750, the quality management standard
which has been adopted by several thousand companies. But the government
wants to see if other methods work first while the British Standards
Institution is unwilling to add another element to its standard. A separate
prompt payment kitemark might be the answer, says Mr Allen.
That some action needs to be taken is evident from the poor payments
performance of British companies. UK suppliers normally quote payment terms
of 30 days but wait 80 days to get paid, according to the British
Association of Factors and Discounters. German and Dutch companies also
normally quote 30-day terms but wait just 50 and 45 days for payment.
A recent survey by Trade Indemnity showed that of the 600 UK companies it
contacted just 3 per cent had been paid on time. Large companies frequently
pressurise small suppliers with the threat of losing all their business
unless they agree to very disadvantageous payment terms.
Despite the fact, or perhaps because, the payments record of British
companies is so poor, the UK has the most developed credit management
industry in Europe. 'We are ahead of continental Europe in terms of the
amount of business information which is available and our expertise in
assessing risk,' says Mr Brian Bailey, managing director of UAPT-Infolink, a
large provider of business and credit information.
Business information groups such as Dun &amp; Bradstreet International,
Infocheck, ICC and UAPT-Infolink provide a wide variety of credit assessment
services in both hard copy and electronic form. A salesman can now call up
credit information in his car before visiting a potential customer.
The factoring companies have been expanding their business in recent years
and could benefit from the end of the present recession if the banks prove
reluctant to provide conventional overdraft lending. The factors provide a
range of services ranging from taking over the management of their client's
sales ledger to simply providing cash against invoices. More than 9,000
companies with a combined turnover of Pounds 16bn make use of factoring or
invoice discounting companies.
The domestic credit insurance industry has been dominated by one company,
Trade Indemnity. But new competition in the form of NCM Credit Insurance, a
Dutch group which acquired the short-term export credit insurance arm of the
Export Credits Guarantee Department, has emerged. NCM claims a 5 per cent
market share after its first year of operations against the 80 per cent held
by Trade Indemnity.
These different sectors of the credit management industry make extensive use
of each other's services. The factors offer credit insurance as an add-on to
their core activities of managing sales ledgers and providing cash while the
credit insurers and the factors make use of the business information groups.
Many of these groups have also diversified into related fields of business.
Dun &amp; Bradstreet and UAPT-Infolink both have debt-collection operations.
Trade Indemnity has a half-share in a factoring company, Trade
Indemnity-Heller Commercial Finance, while Infocheck has developed a credit
insurance service and also linked up with International Factors to provide
factoring and invoice discounting.
'Businesses have become aware that they can substitute one service for
another,' says Mr Bruno Tavernier, a director of ICC. 'There is more
competition between the different parts of the credit management industry.'
But before they make use of outside services such as these, managers must
ensure that their internal credit controls are good. 'People don't help
themselves,' comments Mr Philip Mellor, marketing manager of Dun &amp;
Bradstreet. 'They don't agree terms in advance or call to check that the
goods delivered were satisfactory.'
Three years into a recession the credit specialists still find alarming
examples of poor credit management. Says one: 'If people put as much
professionalism into credit management as they do into sales they would be
much better off.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Profit-takers reverse fresh advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON'S attempt to follow Wall Street to new highs was thwarted yesterday
by a shakeout in the stock index futures market. After gaining 20 points in
early trading, the FT-SE 100 Index turned back sharply when the futures
markets opened and share prices ended the day on the downside.
Confidence in economic recovery remained sound, however, and hopes of a cut
in domestic interest rates around the time of next week's Budget speech were
supported by sterling's relatively stable reception for the announcement of
the latest UK producer price data.
The parliamentary defeat overnight of the UK government on moves to
accelerate the Maastricht legislation introduced an element of political
uncertainty. The stock market continued to debate the prospects of rises in
indirect taxes on Tuesday when Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the
exchequer, makes his Budget speech.
The early gain of 20 points on the Footsie was reversed into a loss of 11.2
by midsession. A sluggish start on Wall Street, where the Dow Industrial
Average was just 2 points ahead in London hours, left the UK market to
drift. Traders reported little sign of significant selling and said
profit-taking was only to be expected following the sharp advance in the
previous session.
At the final reading the FT-SE 100 stood at 2,949.9, down 7.4, with traders
unsure whether to worry about the challenge to the 2,900 mark.
Trading volume was brisk, with 776.5m shares moving through the Seaq system
compared with 654.1m on Monday, when retail business stayed firm at Pounds
1.23bn.
Non-Footsie business increased significantly, to make up about 78 per cent
of the day's total, against recent daily averages of closer to 60 per cent.
The FT-SE Mid 250 Index shaded lower by 0.5 points to 3,119.2.
Market strategists remained confident that the London market still has
further strength behind it and that yesterday's pause was nothing more than
a bout of minor profit-taking following a session when share prices were
driven ahead by a mixture of economic optimism and technical market factors.
The latest advance to new peaks in the UK stock market has taken place
against a backcloth of similar strength in other world markets.
While convincing evidence of a recovery in the UK economy remains elusive,
London traders have taken an increasingly confident view of developments in
the US. At the same time, belief that German interest rates will soon start
to fall underpins expectations that UK rates can remain low, at least until
the end of this year.
However, some analysts are wary of the outlook for UK equities after the
Budget. Mr Craig Knox at Lazard Investors is moving ahead of Mr Lamont's
speech. He told clients that UK shares have performed relatively well over
the past month and that this appears a 'good moment to reduce exposure'.
At Panmure Gordon, Mr Robin Aspinall sees the FT-SE 100 Index now making its
'final dash' for the 3,040-50 target, with both New York and Tokyo providing
encouragement. He believes that this week's data on consumer credit imply a
consumer-led recovery but doubts that consumers will indulge in 'another
1980s style binge'.

FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFIT-TAKING after an early advance caused a sharp retreat in stock index
futures and the March contract on the FT-SE 100 surrendered most of Monday's
impressive gain, writes Joel Kibazo.
The enthusiastic overnight performance on Wall Street seemed set to carry
through into London when the March FT-SE contract opened at 2,985, some 12
points above Monday's strong finish.
This positive mood, however, only lasted a short while before heavy selling
drove the contract down. Profit-taking, together with some uncertainty
following the UK government's setback over the Maastricht bill, seemed to be
the main reason, although the weakness in the fixed interest rate markets
also served to dampen sentiment.
By 11am the contract was trading at 2,966 and, but for a brief rally over
the lunchtime period, sellers continued to have the upper hand, a factor
which also helped to pull the underlying cash market down. The day's low
point of 2,950 was seen shortly after the New York opening.
After a brief bout of short-covering, March ended at 2,959, down 14 from its
previous close and around 8 points ahead of its fair value premium to cash
of minus 2. Turnover was 10,592 contracts.
It was a dull day in traded options and volume was only 29,080 lots. The
Euro FT-SE saw business of 3,049 and Marks and Spencer 3,065.

FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Enterprise Oil lifted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Another major oil discovery, this time on the Norwegian continental shelf,
was announced by a consortium including the UK's Enterprise Oil. The stock
gained 10 at 507p, its best level since November 1991. Turnover was a heavy
3.5m shares.
'This is wonderful news for Enterprise ahead of tomorrow's preliminary
figures, which are expected to include a nudge upwards in the dividend
payment to 16p,' said one oil specialist.
Another said the discovery continued Enterprise's record of strong
exploration success and would keep up the group's production profile in
coming years.
Last week BP announced a substantial oil find west of the Shetland Islands;
initial estimates of the find, where BP has an 80 per cent stake and Royal
Dutch/Shell the remaining 20 per cent, were put at 250m to 500m barrels of
oil.

FT  10 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Pressure on glass producer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASS maker Pilkington was one of the chief casualties in a generally
unhappy building materials arena as the market picked up hints that a flurry
of profits downgradings could be in the pipeline.
The company is believed to have requested meetings with a number of
stockbroking analysts over the next few days and dealers speculated that
these might reveal plans for cost-cutting and write-downs.
Specialists said a large seller of Pilkington shares emerged late on Monday
afternoon and triggered initial downward pressure on the stock.
Additionally, NatWest Securities highlighted the impact on the building
materials stocks of economic slowdown in continental Europe.
There has also been speculation that Pilkington may seek to raise capital,
although some dealers said a rights issue around the current share price
appears unlikely.
Pilkington's preliminary results are due in June and analysts' forecasts
range from Pounds 30m to Pounds 40m. The shares weakened to 105 1/2 p at one
point yesterday before stabilising to end 2 1/2 off at 110 1/2 p. Turnover
of 6.8m shares was well above average.

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow holds its own in spite of
profit-taking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
US SHARE prices were little changed yesterday as investors and dealers
consolidated Monday's record-breaking gains, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 2.70 firmer at 3,472.12.
The index spent the entire session only a few points on either side of
opening values. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 moved in a
similar fashion and ended 0.31 off at 454.40, while the American SE
composite finished 2.29 higher at 419.02 and the Nasdaq composite up 1.73 at
688.96. Trading volume on the New York SE came to 290.7m shares.
Early trading was dominated by profit-taking, as investors sought to book
some of Monday's gains. Yet, in spite of the selling, prices held their own,
an indication of the resilience of the market, which remains supported by
extremely low interest rates, low inflation, and hopes for continued
improvements in corporate profitability.
Prices may also have been aided yesterday by further indications from the
White House that President Clinton is willing to accommodate more spending
cuts in his first budget.
On Monday, reports said that the president would accept an additional
Dollars 55bn in cuts; by yesterday that figure had risen to Dollars 90bn.
Analysts have warned, however, that stock prices could be hit by a
short-term correction over the next week or so. Some remain nervous about
the Dow's record highs, fearing that prices may have risen too far, making
stocks overly expensive in relation to future corporate earnings.
Banks remained in demand as investors bought them in the expectation that
low interest rates will boost bank earnings. BankAmerica climbed Dollars
7/8 to Dollars 53, additionally helped by a ratings upgrade from broking
house PaineWebber, while Citicorp added Dollars 1 at Dollars 28, Wells Fargo
Dollars 3 1/8 at Dollars 108 5/8 and Chemical Dollars 1 at Dollars 42 7/8 .
American Express rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 27 7/8 and Primerica jumped
Dollars 4 3/4 to Dollars 44 3/4 after the two groups confirmed that they
were in talks which could lead to Primerica buying the brokerage and asset
management operations of American Express's troubled Shearson Lehman unit.
Safeway moved ahead Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 13 7/8 as investors continued
to respond to Monday's news that Mr Peter Magowan, the food retailer's
chairman, is stepping down as chief executive to run a baseball team in
California.
HJ Heinz declined Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 42 3/8 after the company issued a
profits warning, saying that the wild fluctuations in European currencies
had hurt its bottom line.
Some leading drug stocks were under pressure, with Pfizer Dollars  3/4 lower
at Dollars 59 3/4 and Bristol Myers-Squibb down Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 57
1/8 .
Canada
TORONTO stocks ended on a mixed note after further heavy trading, as a
continued rally among mining shares was offset by a decline among financial
services issues.
The TSE 300 index edged 2.2 higher to 3,553.2 and rises narrowly led falls
by 333 to 308 after volume of 54.2m shares. Ten of 14 stock groups closed
ahead, with mining adding 1.5 per cent.
The stocks of two major companies in the Hees-Edper group rose in spite of
releasing substantially weaker 1992 results. Hees International Bancorp
gained CDollars  3/4 at CDollars 9 1/4 and Brascan 'A' put on CDollars  5/8
at CDollars 11 7/8 .

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Tenuous balance beneath Bovespa's calm
exterior - Bill Hinchberger analyses Brazil's equity market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Brazilian stock markets have seemed remarkably immune to the political and
economic instability that surround them. Yet underneath their calm exterior,
it appears that the balance is tenuous, provided by a jittery combination of
push and pull.
Last week, after Mr Paulo Haddad resigned as finance minister and Mr Itamar
Franco, the Brazilian president, named Mr Eliseu Resende as his replacement
 -a nomination widely criticised by politicians and business people alike -
the Sao Paulo, or Bovespa, index lost just 1.4 per cent.
Inflation of about 5 per cent during the week boosted the drop in real
terms, but on Monday of this week the market rebounded with an 8.1 per cent
surge, to 14,974, making up the losses. Most traders agreed that Monday's
jump was primarily due to defensive moves by investors, worried about
potential politico-economic initiatives, shifting out of fixed interest
stocks. Yesterday the Bovespa finished a further 3.1 per cent ahead.
Before the ministerial shakeup, Brazilian equities were up with the leaders
among emerging markets. In the two months to end-February they showed an
increase in dollar terms of 21.7 per cent, according to figures from the
International Finance Corporation in Washington, outpaced by only Turkey and
Taiwan.
From December to February, the Bovespa index gained 207 per cent, compared
with inflation of 99 per cent for the period. In December, improvement was
primarily sparked by the end of the political crisis that had dragged on for
most of 1992, ending with the resignation and impeachment of the former
president, Mr Fernando Collor de Mello, after Christmas.
In January and February, the market reacted favourably to gradual reform -
the passage of port modernisation legislation, steps towards fiscal reform,
and advances in debt negotiations with foreign creditors. Yet these positive
signs were offset by apparently impulsive actions by the new president, like
the decision to offer tax breaks for the relaunching of the Volkswagen
Beetle, and delays in the privatisation programme.
The biggest beneficial push was provided by the passage of legislation to
allow public electric utility companies to set rates according to their
costs, without interference by central authorities. Large industrial users
currently pay about Dollars 45 per megawatt hour, compared with an average
generating cost of Dollars 70 per megawatt hour.
The prospect of higher prices made leading utility equities appear as
attractive as stock in Telebras, the state-controlled telecommunications
holding company that customarily accounts for half of daily trading in Sao
Paulo.
Eletrobras, the federal electricity company, gained 122 per cent in real
terms in February. Cemig, the utility concern in Minas Gerais state, jumped
191 per cent in real terms during the month.
Foreign investors might put Dollars 1bn into the electric sector this year,
either by shifting from current Brazilian holdings or through new
investment, ventured Mr Edmund Games - a vice-president of the US investment
house Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark, and portfolio manager for the Brazil Fund, a
closed end fund which trades on the New York Stock Exchange - during a
mid-February visit to Rio de Janeiro.
However, politics are a potential wild card. As Mr Resende gets settled into
office, conjecture will give way to reaction to real events. Today, the
Senate is scheduled to pass final judgment on a financial transactions tax
which, says Mr Franco, is necessary to help balance the federal budget.
Share prices and stock market liquidity are still low. The 593 companies
traded on the Rio de Janeiro exchange closed 1992 with an average book value
of 28 per cent. This contributed to make February the third month in the
last five with no new public share issues.
Foreign investors are tempted, but playing safe. 'The vast majority are
cautious,' Mr Robert Barclay, president of Baring Securities Brasil, says.
'They are waiting for a clear sign that economic reform is moving forward.
Yet they are all terrified of missing out.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Foreign buying supports
Nikkei's advance
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVE foreign buying countered profit-taking by investment trust funds, and
equities gained further ground in volume of 850m shares, the heaviest
trading since September 1991, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average advanced 161.83 to 17,848.30, making a 6.1 per cent rise
over the last two trading days. The index opened at the day's low of
17,724.89 and rose as high as 18,047.16, breaching the 18,000 mark for the
first time since September last year. Profit-taking by the investment trusts
pared some of the gain during the afternoon.
Volume climbed to almost four times the recent market average, on active
buying by arbitrageurs and short-covering by foreign investors. Gains led
losses by 761 to 291, with 124 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks added 18.87 at 1,339.77, although in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index closed just 0.32 up at 1,074.97.
In spite of the rise, some derivatives traders were cautious ahead of
Friday's price fixing for settlements of March contracts of stock index
futures and options. Mr Masa Sato at SG Warburg said the market could
decline towards the end of the week as the bulk of options positions held by
market participants would become profitable if the Nikkei index were to fall
below 17,500.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone was once again the focus of trading. The
issue closed unchanged at Y780,000 in active trading after hitting the day's
peak of Y829,000. Traders noted profit-taking by investment trusts.
Fujikura, a cable maker closely linked to NTT, retreated Y11 to Y599 on
profit-taking.
Foreign investors sought steel and electrical issues. Nippon Steel, the most
active issue of the day, put on Y10 at Y317, NKK Y8 at Y265, Hitachi Y26 at
Y747 and NEC Y56 at Y767.
Companies with close ties to the Japan Railway Group firmed on speculation
that the issues will benefit from the expected listing of JR East later this
year. Nippon Signal, the railway signal maker, moved ahead Y20 to Y1,360,
while Tekken, a construction company and contractor for JR companies, gained
Y13 at Y773.
Aids-related shares firmed on active buying by speculators. Ube Industries
ended Y30 higher at Y390 and Nippon Zeon Y16 dearer at Y588.
In Osaka, the OSE average was 309.16 firmer at 18,793.44 in volume of 212.4m
shares. Pharmaceuticals, electronics and constructions were among leading
gainers. Nintendo, the video game maker, climbed Y320 to Y10,200.
Roundup
POLITICAL events again dominated some of the larger Pacific Rim markets.
HONG KONG took heart from renewed prospects of Sino-British talks soon and
shares resumed their record-breaking run. The Hang Seng index finished 25.84
stronger at an all-time high of 6,508, having touched 6,557.10 during
morning trading. Turnover improved to HKDollars 4.62bn. The previous record
of 6,502.81 was set last Friday.
Banks were the best blue chip performers, with HSBC rising HKDollars 1 to
HKDollars 70. Hang Seng Bank closed HKDollars 2.50 up at HKDollars 69.50
after touching HKDollars 70. Electronics companies were ahead on
expectations of improved sales to the US.
AUSTRALIA tried to take its lead from events on Wall Street, but continuing
election nerves held gains in check and the All Ordinaries index ended 16.6
firmer at 1,633.7.
Retail trade and jobs vacancies data helped the mood. Retail stocks fared
well, notably Coles Myer, which rose 11 cents to ADollars 4.75 as retail
trade figures boosted hopes for its interim results, due tomorrow.
SINGAPORE was mixed, with banks continuing to shed some of their recent
gains. The Straits Times Industrial index eased 3.32 to 1,657.72 in volume
of 221.9m shares. OCBC Foreign declined 30 cents to SDollars 11.70 and UOB
Foreign dipped 15 cents to SDollars 8.95. Inchcape was 15 cents lower at
SDollars 6.05.
BOMBAY suspended trading around midsession after shares came under
unrelenting selling pressure. The BSE index fell by 132.64, or 5.4 per cent,
to 2,318.56 before trading was stopped by the authorities because of the
'abnormal movement' of prices.
TAIWAN saw particular weakness in financials as the weighted index receded
127.11, or 2.8 per cent, to 4,474.47.

FT  10 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan drops on political
turmoil fears
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES mostly offered a modest response to Wall Street's overnight gains,
writes Our Markets Staff, and some of them managed to ignore the Dow
altogether.
MILAN faced the spectre of a government in serious trouble, and what was
briefly seen as the possibility that the prime minister, Mr Giuliano Amato,
might resign. The Comit index fell 17.11, or 3.2 per cent to 511.02 with the
biggest casualties in blue chips, small banks and insurers which had
outperformed in the recent rally.
News that a lunchtime cabinet meeting was being delayed and that Mr Amato
planned to see President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro unnerved investors, already
digesting a resignation threat by the justice minister, Mr Giovanni Conso,
and more arrests in the ever-widening political bribes scandal.
Mr Robert Meiyer, of Intersim in Milan, said that the market was still
taking the bribes scandal in its stride. 'But if the government is facing
collapse, that is another thing.'
Mr John Stewart, of Pastorino and Partners in Milan, added: 'The market
over-reacted. It certainly looked as if there was some panic selling.
'Some of the correction was expected from a technical point of view: a lot
of call options are being exercised due to the end of the account later in
the week. But the political situation has also become very problematic and
Mr Amato's position is seen to have been weakened.'
FRANKFURT got an early boost from Wall Street and a late one from BASF
before it closed with the DAX index 18.31, or 1.1 per cent higher at
1,713.13. After hours, the dividend from Hoechst was an opposing influence.
Turnover rose from DM6.6bn to DM8.2bn. Mr Thomas Nolten of B Metzler in
Frankfurt said that the DM10 dividend from BASF compared with fears of DM9
or even DM8, and lifted the shares by DM12 to DM240.50. Carmakers reflected
the high liquidity in the market, although rises of DM10 to DM491 at BMW and
DM12.50 to DM625.50 at Daimler were slightly offset by a 70 pfg fall to
DM287.70 in Volkswagen.
The BASF decision led to hopes that Hoechst, too, would pay more than the
DM9 expected and Hoechst rose to DM263.50 in the post-bourse against a close
DM2.70 higher at DM256.30. Unfortunately, Hoechst delivered DM9 in the
afternoon, and the shares came back again to DM257.50.
PARIS persisted with its interest rate cut hopes and the CAC 40 index closed
5.83 higher at 2,009.69. One trader said that buying was centered around
smaller companies which had been lagging behind the market.
Remy Cointreau was up FFR8.80, or 6.2 per cent to FFr151.80 while Alsace
Supermarche led the winners with a lift of FFr231, or 13.8 per cent to
FFr1,911 in 21,000 shares.
Euro Disney rose FFr4.30, or 5.1 per cent to FFr88.80. One analyst said he
expected an announcement 'any day' from Euro Disney about refinancing its
debt so as to benefit from easing European rates, but opinion on the stock
remained bearish in a couple of major investment houses.
ZURICH benefited from expectations of lower interest rates and the SMI index
added 19.1 to 2,151.3 after peaking at 2,157.0.
Alusuisse bearers rose SFr13 to SFr501 as the company announced an unchanged
1992 dividend and forecast unchanged results for 1993.
AMSTERDAM continued in positive mood, supported by the dollar and Wall
Street. The CBS Tendency index rose 1.1 to 103.7.
Philips added 30 cents to Fl 23.60 in active trade as recent US demand was
followed up by local investors.
BRUSSELS trading was dominated by Delhaize which closed BFr58 or 4.7 per
cent ahead at the day's high of BFr1,292 in response to a profits forecast.
The Bel-20 index closed 8.27 firmer at 1,236.12 in turnover of BFr1.635bn.
OSLO's all-share index rose 8.69 or 2.1 per cent to 429.05 in very active
trading.
Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum each added NKr1.50 to NKr169 and NKr67.50
respectively after Statoil, in which both have stakes, announced its largest
oil and gas find in recent years in the Nordland II area of the Norwegian
Sea.
DUBLIN seemed to offer a positive response to Wall Street, the ISEQ overall
index rising 23.96 to 1,397.43 for a two-day gain of 3.1 per cent, but
foreign buying, the possibility of the government's 30 per cent stake in
Greencore going into corporate, rather than institutional, hands and, above
all, the drop in domestic interest rates were also put up as factors.
Irish interest rates have come down from 13 3/4 to 12 per cent since
February 19, another half-point cut is on the cards and professionals are
looking for a fall to 10 per cent or lower by the end of this year.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Lira suffers setback
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICAL upheaval in Italy sent the lira sharply lower against the D-Mark
yesterday, writes Emma Tucker.
Rumours that Mr Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, might have to resign
prompted a dramatic slide in the currency, from L948.8 per D-Mark at the
close on Monday, to L964 at last night's close.
Mr Mark Brett, director of bond and currency strategy at Barclays de Zoete
Wedd, said the market had reacted negatively to the fact that Italians were
selling the lira heavily.
'The markets think the Italians are in the know,' commented one analyst.
The Bank of Italy intervened to prop up the currency as speculation about Mr
Amato's future grew. He is in trouble because of a government-proposed
decree which he co-authored that would take immediate effect and would allow
corruption suspects to avoid jail.
Expectations of monetary easing by the Bundesbank dominated the rest of the
day's trading. One trader said that forecasts for German growth were being
downgraded by the day, as analysts caught up with the extent of corp-orate
grief in the country.
The dollar struggled in late trading after a lurch upwards in the early
afternoon. Analysts said there was nothing significant in the rise, although
news that IG Metall, the German metal and engineering workers' union, had
called for token strikes in east Germany provided some support for the
currency. The US unit finished in London up  1/2 pfennig on the day at
DM1.6675. In New York the dollar was finally a shade below the London close
at DM1.6663.
Sterling weathered the government's defeat over the Maastricht treaty on
Monday night relatively well. It slipped a pfennig on the day but dealers
reported that overseas investors were quick to buy the pound back from a
DM2.3854 low.
Mr Brett said fears about the UK's role in Europe were 'overplayed',
pointing out that Monday's defeat did not threaten ratification of the
treaty, but merely delayed it. Although overseas investors are confused by
the UK parliament's machinations over Maastricht, dealers reported that
sentiment towards the pound was generally 'more kind'.
However, many analysts doubt that the pound will be able to break above
DM2.41 before the Budget. Suggestions that the UK chancellor may raise taxes
could cause the currency to slip.
'If there is anything too aggressive in the Budget on fiscal policy, the
currency might wobble because the market will start to expect further
interest rate cuts,' added Mr Brett. Sterling finished at DM2.3925.
The franc was marginally lower against the D-Mark. It ended at FFr3.391,
compared with the previous close of FFr3.389. The peseta was also slightly
weaker, closing at Pta71.12 to the D-Mark.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Futures drift lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN currency futures drifted lower yesterday in generally quiet
trading.
Although the market is still expecting the Bundesbank to ease its officially
posted rates on Thursday next week, one dealer commented that expectations
had raced ahead too quickly.
'I think there has been too much expectation priced into the market and
people are now reining back,' he said.
The June Euromark futures contract eased slightly from an opening of 93.12,
leading to a sharper fall in French franc futures. The June Pibor contract,
after starting the day at 91.58, dropped to around 91.52.
Sterling futures also slipped on the day, with a weaker pound and concern
over the government's defeat in the House of Commons over the Maastricht
treaty compounding the downward drift.
Few in the UK money markets are expecting a rate cut on Budget Day next
week. Even afterwards, dealers are not optimistic that the authorities will
ease policy at an early stage, especially while the pound is languishing at
around the DM2.40 level.
The market appears to have taken on board comments by the Bank of England
that it does not want to see the pound significantly lower than current
levels.
One dealer complained that each time sterling recouped some of its losses, a
full scale recovery was scuppered by political mishaps.
'So long as the government keeps shooting itself in the foot with the pound,
the longer it is going to be before they can cut rates,' he said.
The June short sterling contract, which opened at 94.56, was trading around
7 basis points lower at the close.
After the Bank of England unexpectedly forecast a cash surplus on Monday,
yesterday saw the usual forecast for a liquidity shortage. Ironically, the
market was reluctant to part with paper and overnight rates were forced up
to around 8 per cent, compared with Monday's 4 per cent.
One-week money firmed to just above 6 per cent from 5 1/2 per cent. Further
out there was little movement. The key three-month interbank rate was
unchanged at around 5 5/16 per cent on the offered side.
The shortage, which was revised during the day to Pounds 1.3bn, was relieved
in the late afternoon when the Bank provided late assistance.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bomb teaches NY exchanges the
value of co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE

<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROUGH ESTIMATES of the cost of keeping New York's five commodities exchanges
operating during the week after the World Trade Center bomb blast fall near
Dollars 1m, with most of the money spent on emergency services such as fire
patrols and auxiliary cooling equipment.
The cost, exchange executives say, has been minor, compared with the
importance of keeping the markets open. The exchanges include the New York
Mercantile Exchange, where most of the world's oil is priced, the New York
Commodity Exchange, an important metals market, the New York Cotton
Exchange, the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, and the tiny New York Futures
Exchange, a subsidiary of the New York Stock Exchange.
These markets provide worldwide price quotes for a variety of strategic
commodities. 'We had to stay open,' says Mr Lou Guttman, the Nymex chairman.
'There was a lot of money riding on this. If we had closed down for two
weeks, I would have had to tell a lot of guys to go home and not come back.
There wouldn't have been a market to come back to.'
At the exchanges, which share a trading floor in a WTC building not directly
hit by the blast, the week following the bombing was marked by severe
problems. Traders and support staff laboured without heat or air
conditioning amid repeated crank bomb threats and the overhanging threat of
power loss. Technicians at one point brought in dry ice to cool exchange
computers; and the Nymex and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange worked out a
pact for emergency price reporting, in case Nymex's tickers failed.
Despite the difficulties, traders managed to squeeze a lot of business into
half-day sessions. Volume at the Coffee Sugar and Cocoa Exchange was
actually higher than in the same week in 1992, and the giant Nymex traded
only about 20 per cent fewer contracts. Volumes at the Comex and the Cotton
Exchange were down about 40 per cent for the week, and the Nyfe turned about
15 per cent fewer trades.
This week, air conditioning has been restored and most trading hours have
returned to normal, with the exception of earlier closings for the Nymex and
a half-session for Comex's Eurotop 100 futures.
The atmosphere at the Commodity Exchange Center is far from normal, however.
Nymex oil traders, reminded of their vulnerability to terrorism, have sought
additional security. Bomb-sniffing dogs now roam the trading floor, armed
guards patrol the lobbies and packages are examined by airport-style x-ray
machines.
The crisis, it seems, brought an unexpected benefit: exchange executives say
it forced co-operation between the five normally fractious exchanges. 'We
were actually working together,' said the Nymex's Mr Guttman.
The bombing has also set off a scramble for 'shadow' trading floors. The
Nyfe is refitting its old space at the New York Stock Exchange for
emergencies and Nymex, which plans to move to new quarters in Manhattan in
the second quarter of 1994, may keep its WTC space as a back-up.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: India opens door to private
mining investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KUNAL BOSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A dramatic policy U-turn, the Indian federal government has decided to
allow private sector participation in the exploration for and mining of 13
minerals hitherto reserved to public sector operations. The minerals are
iron ore, manganese, chrome, sulphur, gold, diamond, copper, lead, zinc,
molybdenum, tungsten, nickel and the platinum group.
Under the new order, Indian public and private sector mining companies will
be allowed 50 per cent foreign equity participation on an automatic basis.
But the government will be ready to sanction higher foreign capital
participation depending on the merits of each case. However, mineral and
metal processing units with any level of foreign equity will now be allowed
to develop captive mines (mines tied to metal processors).
While the new national mineral policy is part of India's economic reform
programme, it is also a response to the need to introduce foreign technology
and funds to develop 'world grade mines to produce minerals at
internationally competitive rates'.
India has had success in recent years in discovering new mineral deposits
through modern exploration techniques, but the public sector, in many cases,
could not mobilise resources to develop mines. For example, Hindustan
Copper, India's only copper producer, was forced to postpone the development
of Malanjkhand underground copper ore mine with estimated reserve of 275m
tonnes because of lack of finance.
Things may now look up for Hindustan Copper and other public sector
undertakings. According to Mr Balram Singh Yadav, minister of state for
mines, the government has received a good number of enquiries for mineral
exploration from leading mining companies in the US, Australia, South Africa
and Canada.
The government is hoping that joint ventures with foreign companies as
partners will focus on the exploitation of those minerals in which the
country is deficient or does not have exportable surpluses. An objective of
the new policy is to promote the export of Indian minerals with as much
value added as possible.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Irish meat output set to reach
record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH MEAT output is likely to hit record levels during 1993, thanks to
continuing growth in the country's cattle, sheep and pig herds.
According to figures released by the Irish Livestock and Meat Board this
week, the breeding herds for all three livestock sectors now stand at their
highest levels on record. Based on census data from last December, there are
now 2.17m head of Irish breeding cows, 4.8m breeding ewes, and 170,000
breeding sows and gilts.
The overall total for the cattle herd masks diverging trends for the dairy
and suckler cow (beef) herds. Dairy cow numbers fell by 2 per cent to 1.26m
head, while suckler cow numbers grew by 17 per cent to 912,000 head. This,
says the CBF, is because of farmers responding to reforms of the European
Community's common agricultural policy by building their suckler herds.
The capping of ewe premiums at 1991 levels under the new CAP reforms means
that the sheep breeding flock is unlikely to grow further this year, says
the CBF, while it notes that the rise in the pig breeding herd by 30 per
cent since late 1989 makes 'the Irish herd one of the fastest growing in
Europe'.
On the basis of these figures the CBF estimates that cattle supplies in 1993
will be 'somewhat over 1.9m head', sheep supplies will increase by 3 per
cent to some 4.8m head while total pig slaughterings 'could exceed 3.3m
head'.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cautious optimism on diamond
prospects
</HEADLINE>

DE BEERS, the company that dominates diamond sales, yesterday gave a
cautiously upbeat view of the health of the industry, despite the weakness
of the world economy.
Speaking yesterday at the announcement of the company's annual results in
Johannesburg, Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the chairman, said: 'The Central
Selling Organisation (the De Beers controlled group that sells 80 per cent
of the world's rough diamonds) restricted its sales in the latter part of
1992 and the balance between rough supply and demand in the cutting centres
has been restored.'
Mr Ogilvie Thompson confirmed market talk that sales at the first two sights
 -the rough diamond auctions that take place ten times a year - had been
'very good', but put this down to exceptional factors - the scarcity of
diamonds from Angola, a hiatus in supply of Russian polished diamonds
following imposition of a 20 per cent export duty and high demand from
India.
Directors of De Beers also stressed yesterday that diamond jewellery sales
had held up very well in a recessionary climate. Mr Jeremy Pudney, a
director of the CSO, said the volume of jewellery pieces sold, and the
overall value of sales, had been very similar in 1992 to 1991. He said
sales, by value, had grown by about 4 per cent in the US, 9 per cent in
Germany and 6 per cent in France. Japanese sales fell by about 5 per cent in
dollar terms, with sales in Italy and the UK also slightly down.
Mr Gary Ralfe, a De Beers director, gave a positive account of relations
between De Beers and the Russian industry. He confirmed that Russia was
abiding by quota requirements, noting that its production had fallen by 25
per cent in 1992, with a further 15 per cent decline expected in 1993.
Mr Ralfe predicted a 'deluge' of Russian polished diamonds on to the market
if, as expected, the 20 per cent duty on diamond exports was lifted. He said
their stockpile was estimated at up to Dollars 1bn. He stressed, however,
that the Russians had not, in recent years, undermined prices in this market
as they had done with other commodities.
The sale of rough diamonds by Russia outside the CSO was a 'niggle' and not
something that could affect the general balance of the market.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Norwegian oil find put at 440m
barrels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY HAS announced its biggest oil discovery in eight years, made in the
remote northern region of the Norwegian Sea where relatively limited
exploration has been undertaken.
The find is likely to encourage industry interest in exploration in the
region, particularly when awards for acreage in the country's 14th licensing
round are announced later this year.
Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, which made the discovery, believes
it could be bigger than the find recently made by British Petroleum west of
the Shetland Isles, which is estimated to contain 250m to 500m barrels of
oil.
'We are very excited by the promise of the discovery and are working hard to
enable the field to be developed. The discovery increases the faith we have
in the future of the Norwegian continental shelf,' said Mr Johan Nic Vold,
group executive vice-president. Statoil's preliminary estimate of the new
oil reserves is 70m cubic metres, or 440m barrels. A third well is planned
to be drilled in the north-western part of the structure where Statoil
believes reserves could be boosted substantially. The field also contains
about 10bn cu m of gas, which could be reinjected into the reservoir during
the early stages of production.
Ms Wenche Skorge, a Statoil spokeswoman, said because the discovery is
situated in 400 metres of water, which is considered very deep by industry
standards, an integrated floating production platform is likely to be one of
the main solutions to be studied for the development of the as yet unnamed
field.
Statoil intends to lodge a plan for development of the field in 1994 and to
bring it on stream in 1998. Industry analysts suggest development costs
could be between NKr20bn and NKr25bn (Pounds 1.95bn and Pounds 2.45bn),
depending on the chosen scheme.
The field is about 85 km (53 miles) north-east of the NKr24bn Heidrun field,
at present being developed by Conoco Norway to come on stream in the third
quarter of 1995. Heidrun contains 750m barrels of oil. Ms Skorge said the
new field could be the size of Heidrun, but at any rate it is the largest
discovery on the Norwegian continental shelf since Heidrun was found in
1985.
The Norwegian Petroleum Directorate's provisional reserves estimate of the
field is 50m cu m, or about 315m barrels of oil, but Statoil says the NPD's
estimate is far too conservative. The NPD says several wells will have to be
drilled before reserves can be estimated with certainty.
The partners in the field include Statoil, with a 50 per cent stake of which
25 per cent is the Norwegian state's direct interest; Norsk Hydro and Saga
Petroleum, each with 15 per cent, and Norsk Agip and Enterprise Oil Norge
each with 10 per cent.

A steadier undertone prevailed on the LME. Dealers said the generally steady
trend seen in COPPER helped other metals, although significant upward breaks
were unlikely. Three-month copper was reluctant to test the band of
resistance above Dollars 2,170 a tonne. Although some traders reported
Chinese buying, most felt that China had been a small-scale seller recently,
so the market was expected to re-test downside support. Three-month NICKEL
remained firmer, building on the move above Dollars 6,050. A fall in LME
stocks, Pacific Metals' decision to sustain its production cut to June, and
talk of scrap shortages and Russian shipments tailing off in Europe were
supportive. London COFFEE and COCOA wound up quietly after a day when the
main market features were lethargy and apathy, traders said. In Chicago
SOYABEANS moved higher early amid fund buying as rumours circulated that
several US banks had re-opened credit lines to Russia.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Gold price tumbles to lowest
for seven years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOLD TUMBLED through the bottom of its recent trading range on the London
bullion market yesterday. It was fixed at consecutive seven-year lows of
Dollars 327.20 a troy ounce in the morning and Dollars 326.95 in the
afternoon, before closing at Dollars 326.45, a fall of 70 cents on the day.
The fall in London followed pressure on the New York Commodity Exchange
(Comex) futures market from US commodity fund sales on Monday. The Comex
April contract, which held above Dollars 327 am ounce on Monday, went to
Dollars 326.60 in early trading yesterday.
Ms Rhona O'Connell, analyst at Williams de Broe, said the fall was heralded
last week by the decline of the commercial rand to 3.19 against the US
dollar. At Dollars 328 an ounce, South African producers were able to sell
their gold forward at R1,050 a troy ounce, giving them a healthy profit.
Analysts in London yesterday pointed out that there is little apart from Far
Eastern demand to support the gold price. 'There is a total lack of
interest. People have other games to play,' said Mr Euan Worthington of SG
Warburg, pointing out that inflation was no longer a factor in investment
decisions, and that the US stock market is moving strongly ahead.
'We are in a situation where gold has been by-passed as an investment
instrument in the Western World,' said Mr Lawrence Eagles of GNI, the London
futures brokers. 'It is now used just for jewellery.'
China has emerged as the main supportive factor for the gold market - a
report last month from American Precious Metals Advisors of the US suggested
that the country absorbed 800 tonnes (26m troy ounces) last year. This more
than offset the 650 tonnes sold by central banks, including 400 tonnes by
the Dutch.
However, the threat of further central bank sales continues to hang over the
bullion market. In addition producers have been able to lock in profits by
forward selling as their currencies have weakened against the dollar.
Gold has now broken through the bottom of its recent range of Dollars 327 to
Dollars 332 a troy ounce, and many analysts expect further falls.
'Technically it is looking very very bad,' said Mr Eagles, who expected the
price to fall rapidly if Dollars 325 was breached, possibly going below
Dollars 300 by the end of the year.

THE SITUATION of Cuba's 1992 - 1993 sugar crop is 'tense' and harvesting and
milling are being carried out with less than 20 per cent of the resources
used in past harvests, according to official newspaper Granma, reports
Reuter from Havana.
Granma, the mouthpiece of the ruling Communist Party, said there were
accumulated delays in harvesting and milling more than three months after
the start of the current campaign.
'A clear example of the harsh reality being faced is that there are still
some mills which have not yet started milling,' the newspaper added.

FT  10 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Spain and France bear brunt of turnround
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN government bond markets fell yesterday after the strong rally of
recent days, though traders said that the markets remained generally
positive on the expectations of further German interest rate cuts.
The falls were most pronounced in Spain and France, two of the countries
which have had the strongest run compared with German bonds. The yield on
10-year Spanish bonds eased to 11.37 per cent from 11.29 per cent by
yesterday's close as the peseta weakened on the foreign exchanges, though it
remained around one-third of a percentage point lower than a week before.
French bond futures fell back, with the Matif contract falling to 115.30
from 115.50 in moderate trade. The reversal led to a widening in the yield
spread between German and French bonds, which had narrowed to around 75
basis points at the end of last week. By the end of yesterday, the spread
stood at around 85 basis points.
Italian bonds also slid, though for domestic political reasons rather than
on the general trend in Europe.
Prices fell sharply ahead of yesterday's special cabinet meeting on the
corruption scandal as traders expressed fears that Mr Giuliano Amato, the
prime minister, may have been about to resign.
The Italian bond futures contract on Liffe reflected the volatility, falling
to a low of 96.30 from 96.78 before bouncing to a high of 97.10. It settled
back to end around 96.60.
UK government bond prices fell yesterday, with losses concentrated in
longer-dated issues, partially reversing the recent flattening of the yield
curve. Producer price figures showing a higher-than-expected rise in input
prices, due to sterling's devaluation, aroused some concerns about
inflation.
Input prices rose 1.4 per cent in February (6.9 per cent year-on-year),
though little of the extra cost was passed on in output prices, which rose
0.4 per cent in the month.
With 28,000 contracts traded, the June long gilt contract on Liffe opened at
107 5/32 and hit of a high of 107 11/32 before ending back at 106 15/16 .
The tranche of 6 3/4 per cent gilts due 1995, announced on Monday before,
was exhausted during the day.
US Treasury prices were flat to lower yesterday as the market consolidated
the big gains on Monday morning.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  1/16 at 105
5/32 , yielding 6.722 per cent. At the short end, the two-year note was down
 3/32 at 99 3/4 , to yield 4.996 per cent.
In the absence of the economic statistics, trading was relatively calm, at
least compared to Monday's early business when prices rose on reports that
President Bill Clinton was ready to accept more spending cuts in his budget.
The lack of buying in early trading was in part a reflection of nervousness
among investors about today's expected announcement from the president of
new measures to tackle the credit crunch. The bond market was worried that
rules would be introduced restricting banks' acquisitions of Treasuries.
Some politicians have argued that banks have been buying government
securities instead of extending loans to business and consumers.
The treasury eased concerns later in the day, saying there were no plans to
curb bank buying of government securities. This helped prices recover but by
late afternoon Treasuries had dropped back to near their lows for the day.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Liffe launches Spanish
contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LATEST round in the battle for futures business between London and other
continental European financial centres gets under way today as Liffe
launches a Spanish bond futures contract.
Liffe claimed yesterday that its new contract, based on 10-year Spanish
government bonds, would not take business away from Meff, the Spanish
financial futures and options exchange, but would attract new business from
international investors. 'There is a much bigger market there than is being
realised by Meff's contract,' said Mr Roger Barton, head of business
development.
However, Meff has claimed that Liffe's contract will split liquidity between
the two markets, and has cut its fees in an attempt to lift its share of
bond futures trading.
The futures contract is likely to be attractive to traders given the high
volatility in the market, which at 7 per cent has been the highest of any
leading bond market over the past year in terms of 50-day price movements.
Spanish bonds are expected to outperform in local currency terms once German
interest rates fall.
The competition for Spanish bond futures business comes as Liffe has
established a 50 per cent to 60 per cent share of trading in Italian bond
futures and a 60 per cent to 70 per cent share of German contracts. Its
share of medium-term German bond (or Bobl) futures is far smaller.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Turkey may place Netas shares
abroad
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish government might consider placing shares in Netas, the Turkish
telecommunications group, with foreign institutions following the failure of
a local share issue.
The government's sale of shares in Netas direct to the Turkish public has
attracted applications for just 35 per cent of the offer.
The poor response is a blow to Turkey's privatisation programme, and a
measure of the immaturity of the local share market.
Brokers say that at an offer price of TL8,250, the company is on a price
earnings ratio of 2.6, markedly lower than others in the sector. However,
fewer than 5,000 applications were received, 1,000 of which were from Netas
employees.
Netas is 51 per cent owned by Northern Telecom of Canada. The government was
hoping to reduce its share stake in Netas from 49 per cent to 29 per cent
via the offer.
To attract local institutions, the government is raising the ceiling for a
single application from 5,000 to 30,000 shares, an investment of Dollars
27,000.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Bonds: D-Mark sector helped by continued flood
of issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The D-Mark sector became the centre of attention again yesterday as the
recent flood of new international bond issues continued unabated.
Syndicate managers said they expected new-issue activity to remain high for
the rest of the week, since most sectors of the international bond market
did not appear to be saturated.
Yesterday's heavy issuance in the D-Mark sector - just over DM2bn was raised
 -came in a variety of structures and maturities, which helped the market to
absorb a fair amount of the total. However, syndicate managers said that
although investor demand for D-Mark paper was still healthy, it would take
some time before yesterday's issues were fully placed.
They added that a widening of yield spreads in sovereign D-Mark-denominated
paper, caused by fears that Finland's credit rating might be downgraded,
could discourage borrowers from tapping this sector of the international
bond market.
On Monday, a senior Finnish finance ministry official said it was likely
that Standard &amp; Poor's would lower the credit rating of the Republic of
Finland in the near future. Finland is currently rated AA+ by the US credit
rating agency. S&amp;P declined to comment yesterday, but noted that it had a
negative outlook on Finland's rating.
Yesterday, the European Investment Bank launched DM500m-worth of seven-year
Eurobonds and, as usual, the pricing was tight.
The bonds were priced to yield eight basis points over comparable German
government bonds.
The spread tightened slightly by mid-afternoon, but an official at the lead
manager, WestLB, said this reflected weaker bund prices.
Deutsche Bank raised DM1bn for itself through an issue of four-year
Eurobonds. The bonds were priced at 15 basis points over the series 99 of
medium-term German government bonds, and later tightened to 13 basis points.
The D-Mark sector saw another wave of reverse floating rate notes (FRNs),
and investor demand for these instruments geared to falling interest rates
allowed some borrowers to increase the size of their issues.
The Republic of Austria increased its FRN issue to DM400m from DM300m and
Dresdner International Finance added another DM50m to the DM150m FRN issue
which it launched on Monday.
Goldman Sachs confirmed that it had won a mandate with Lehman Brothers to
arrange a dollar-denominated Eurobond issue for the African Development
Bank.
An official at Goldman Sachs said the issue would be launched within the
next two weeks but declined to comment on market talk that the bonds would
raise Dollars 500m and have a maturity of 10 years.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley is close to launching a Y50bn convertible Eurobond
issue for the Bank of Tokyo.
The Eurodollar sector was also active, with Ciba-Geigy Corporation, the US
arm of the Swiss drug company, raising Dollars 100m through an issue of
seven-year bonds.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the lead manager, said the issue was part of
Ciba-Geigy's current medium-term note programme.
The bonds were priced to yield 30 basis points over the 6 3/8 per cent US
Treasuries due 2000, but the spread later tightened by five basis points,
reflecting good demand, especially from Switzerland.
State-owned Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) plans to issue up to Dollars
525m-worth of Eurobonds this year as part of its financing programme, Reuter
reports from Mexico City.
Pemex intends to launch four Eurobond issues in all, the first two in
dollars, with maturities of three to seven years and amounts of between
Dollars 125m and Dollars 200m.
The other two issues could be denominated in D-Marks, yen, sterling or Swiss
francs.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: PepsiCo buys into Hungary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEPSICO, the US food and drink group, yesterday acquired FAU, a leading
Hungarian soft drink company, and said it would invest Dollars 115m in the
Budapest area over the next five years.
The US group took a 79 per cent interest for an undisclosed sum in FAU,
which had previously produced Pepsi products under licence for the Budapest
area. This is the first time that Pepsi has taken an equity stake in one of
the bottlers and distributors of its products in eastern Europe.
The acquisition of FAU's four plants is part of the broader drive by Pepsi
to regain market leadership in Hungary from Coca-Cola and maintain its
position in eastern Europe ahead of its rival. Pepsi plans to increase
production capacity and boost output of soft drinks in plastic bottles.
Pepsi said yesterday it was also interested in acquiring the state-owned
Pepsi franchise operations in Hungarian regions outside Budapest.
Pepsi's plans for Hungary are part of a wider investment in eastern Europe
amounting to 'close to Dollars 1bn', according to Mr David Jones, president
of Pepsi-Cola International's Eastern Europe division.

consecutive annual loss

<TEXT>
TUNGSRAM, the Hungarian light bulb group in which General Electric of the US
has a 75 per cent stake, plunged to a Ft9bn (Dollars 104m) loss in 1992 and
will remain unprofitable this year.
This is the third consecutive loss for the group, and the biggest in
Hungarian corporate history. It represents a 70 per cent increase on the
loss for the previous 12 months.
GE acknowledges the need for a further injection of capital on top of the
Dollars 350m it has invested in the venture. The injection would cover
accumulated losses, provide cash for operations and cut debt. Losses in the
past two years total Ft14.3bn, using international accounting standards.
General Electric might be obliged to buy out the minority shareholding of
Hungarian Credit Bank. The state-owned bank is unhappy with the partnership
and needs resources to cope with its own financial difficulties. But the US
company said yesterday speculation on a buy-out was premature.
Mr Charles Pieper, chief executive officer of Tungsram and GE Lighting
Europe, blamed the deficit on growing borrowings, a write-off of inherited
Russian trade debts and restructuring costs.
Tungsram announced a further 900 redundancies out of its shrunken workforce
of 10,200.
General Electric paid Dollars 150m for an initial 50 per cent of previously
state-owned Tungsram in 1990, creating the first sizeable western joint
venture in eastern Europe and a symbol for the region's economic opening.
Tungsram was regarded as a rare Hungarian industrial jewel, possessing
corporate pride and about 6 per cent of the western European light bulb
market
Tungsram has doubled forint sales in western Europe since 1989. GE has also
secured dramatic improvements in productivity in Hungary and has capitalised
on the quality of local research workers.
But Tungsram has not been insulated from eastern Europe's economic crisis.
To bear down on inflation, the Budapest government has maintained exchange
and interest rates which are painfully high for exporters such as Tungsram.
Sales in the former communist countries have fallen 90 per cent with the
collapse of the Comecon bloc.

in Asia
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTPAC, the troubled Australian banking group, said yesterday it planned to
dispose of many of its Asian operations in a restructuring of its global
activities.
Westpac is to sell branch operations in Seoul and Taipei, a joint-venture
interest in Jakarta, and finance businesses in Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore. Its six US offices will be consolidated
into the New York office.
The group will focus on corporate banking and global financial market
operations in Australia, New Zealand, the US, Europe, Japan, Hong Kong and
Singapore.
It said the remaining Asian businesses would focus on servicing Australian
corporations, foreign companies operating in Australia and New Zealand, and
participants in financial markets. Westpac has already repositioned its
European business to concentrate on similar activities.
Mr Robert Joss, the American banker appointed managing director last month,
said its Asian banking and finance interests had been profitable, but were
no longer central to the bank's objectives.
Mr Joss said the bank's global strategy 'should be to concentrate on those
businesses in which we have a clear competitive advantage and which offer
significant prospects for growth'.
The restructuring follows Westpac's abandonment of its 1980s strategy of
offering a full range of banking services in the main global markets.
Westpac has suffered a series of reverses recently, climaxing in a record
loss of ADollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1.06bn) for the year to September, after
writing off bad debts of ADollars 2.6bn and an unexpected US tax liability
of ADollars 106m. Five directors, including the then-chairman, resigned last
year.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: A question of duty for Samsung -
Electronics group awaits key US decision on tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STAKES are high for Samsung Electronics, South Korea's largest
electronics group, as it anxiously awaits a decision from Washington on
whether the US will impose dumping duties on its semiconductors.
Such penalties could pose a serious threat to the com-pany's profitability.
Samsung Electronics, the flagship of the Samsung industrial conglomerate,
reported a 5.5 per increase in net earnings to Won72.4bn (Dollars 91m) in
1992 as sales rose by 16.7 per cent to Won6,103bn.
The semiconductor division, although accounting for only 22 per cent of
total sales, is the main source of the earnings for the company. Analysts
estimate that the division generated taxable profits of Won110bn last year.
Its larger consumer electronics division, with 54 per cent of turnover,
provided Won10bn in pre-tax profits, while telecommunications added another
Won25bn, according to analysts.
The personal computer operations incurred estimated losses of Won35bn.
Pre-tax profits for the group were Won111.6bn - an increase of 21.2 per
cent.
It is considered unlikely the US will penalise Samsung Electronics with the
87.4 per cent dumping duty on 1M and 4M dynamic random access memory (D-Ram)
chips it proposed last autumn. This was in response to a complaint from
Micron Technology, the US concern which provided Samsung with semiconductor
technology in the 1980s.
But even a much lower duty could reduce semiconductor exports to the US,
which purchased more than half of the company's output of D-Ram chips last
year. 'Anything above a 15 per cent dumping duty would be bad news for the
company,' said Mr Hwang Sung-june, electronics analyst for WI Carr in Seoul.
The US Commerce Department is expected on Monday to determine the level of
dumping duty, while a decision on whether to impose it will be made by the
end of next month. The US action follows a decision by the EC last year to
apply a self-regulating pricing policy to Korean chipmakers after the EC
threatened to impose dumping duties. Samsung is increasing semiconductor
shipments to south-east Asia in response to the trade problems with the US
and Europe.
Samsung is the world's fifth-largest producer of memory chips and the
biggest producer of D-Ram chips, which account for 70 per cent of its
intergrated circuit production.
The group's strategic importance to South Korea as one of the country's few
competitive high-technology companies and its second-biggest listed concern
may force the government to support it with increased subsidised loans and
other financial aid for research and investment if the dumping duties
seriously threaten profits.
Earnings are already under pressure due to the company's heavy research and
capital expenditures, which total more than Dollars 1bn annually. Its 1992
research and development budget of Won460bn was the biggest among Korean
companies, with almost half devoted to semiconductors.
The ambitious R&amp;D effort has paid off with the recent development of what
was claimed to be the world's first laboratory model of the 64M D-Ram chip.
It also spent Won740bn last year to build a production line for 16M D-Ram
chips and modernise consumer electronics factories. But R&amp;D and capital
spending increased its debt/equity to an estimated 320 per cent last year.
The looming challenges confronting Samsung Electronics forced a management
reorganisation in December, with the company's four previously autonomous
divisions being placed under the direct control of a new president, Mr Kim
Kwang-ho, who was formerly head of the semiconductor division. The
management consolidation was considered necessary to correct problems
stemming from the 1988 merger between the Samsung Electronics and Samsung
Semiconductor and Telecommunications.
A slimmer management structure is meant to end the duplication of research
and sales activities among the four divisions, while promoting faster
decision-making.
Samsung has recently forged technical alliances with other chipmakers to
reduce production costs.
It signed an agreement in December to produce advanced 'flash' memory chips
developed by Toshiba. Samsung will also manufacture semiconductor chips at a
Texas Instruments' plant in Portugal, while it plans to make semiconductor
manufacturing equipment in a joint venture with Dainippon Screen of Japan.
Analysts believe that improved prospects for consumer electronics and
telecommunications might balance a possible profit fall for semi-conductors.
The consumer electronics division is cutting manufacturing costs by moving
facilities to low-wage countries, with the production of microwave ovens in
Malaysia, refrigerators in the Czech Republic and VCRs in China.
The depreciation of the Korean won has helped increase exports of consumer
electronics to south-east Asia and Latin America, which are emerging as new
markets as sales slow in the US and Europe. Domestic demand is also expected
to expand this year as the economy recovers to an estimated growth rate of 6
per cent.
Public procurement of telecommunications equipment, such as Samsung's
telephone exchanges, is also expected to rise this year with the
installation of a new cellular telephone system.
But Samsung is likely to suffer continuing losses in its personal computer
business due to fierce competition and price-cutting in this sector.

HONG KONG Aircraft Engineering Company (Haeco), a Swire Pacific group
company which holds the monopoly on commercial aircraft maintenance and
engineering in the colony, yesterday posted a 21 per cent rise in net
profits for 1992 to HKDollars 387.9m (USDollars 50m), from HKDollars 320.6m
in 1991.
The profits were struck on a 16 per cent increase in turnover to HKDollars
2bn, from HKDollars 1.8bn.
The company said there had been good use of its airframe maintenance
facilities and increased activity in its overhaul division.
Mr Peter Sutch, chairman, said the volume of work passing through Haeco was
expected to be satisfactory during 1993.
To maintain competitiveness, the company was focusing on improvements in
productivity and a drive to improve quality, he said.
These measures were expected to produce an acceptable result in 1993,
despite high inflation in Hong Kong.
Haeco is 51.85 per cent owned by Swire Pacific and 25.04 per cent owned by
Cathay Pacific, the main customer for its services.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: The Pru leads the charge as
bondholders join battle - Nikki Tait reports on the furore surrounding
Marriott's demerger plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGHT of The Prudential, one of Britain's largest institutional
investors, rampaging through the UK corporate arena is familiar enough. It
features less frequently on the US stage.
But a furore over plans by Marriott Corporation of the US to divide itself
into two separately-quoted companies has pushed the Pru - via PPM America,
its Chicago-based fund management arm - into the limelight.
The battle lines were drawn last October, shortly after the Maryland-based
lodging and food services group had announced plans to spin off its
financially-healthy hotel operations from its troubled property business.
Under this 'demerger' scheme, Marriott would place its lodging business,
together with its food and facilities management operations, in a new
company, to be called Marriott International. Shareholders would receive
shares in the new company pro rata to their existing holdings in Marriott
Corp, and Marriott International would be quoted in New York.
This would leave the existing company - to be renamed Host Marriott -
holding most of the group's property assets and its airport and toll-road
concessions. Host Marriott would also be saddled with the bulk of the
group's long-term debt, totalling about Dollars 3bn.
From the company's viewpoint, the scheme's advantages were plain. Marriott's
management businesses, freed from the debt burden and the overhang of
property assets which had proved hard to sell, could power ahead more
aggressively as the recession ended.
Not surprisingly, Marriott Corp's shares took heart. Having fluctuated
around Dollars 15 to Dollars 17 for much of 1992, the stock rose by more
than Dollars 2 to Dollars 19 1/4 on the news, and closed yesterday at
Dollars 26.
But if shareholders - who still include the Marriott family with about a
quarter of the equity - had reason to smile, Marriott Corp bondholders were
less fortunate. Analysts noted that Host Marriott would have debt of Dollars
2.9bn and a debt-capital ratio of 92 per cent. It would hold unsold property
assets, the value of which could be affected by the vagaries of the US
property market. The adequacy of the cash-flow coverage at Host Marriott was
also questioned.
Credit-rating agencies shivered. Moody's moved Marriott's existing debt
securities from investment to non-investment grade rating, and Standard &amp;
Poor's put them on 'credit-watch'. Bond prices plunged.
In December, some of the bondholders - led by PPM - sued. Their action
related directly to a Dollars 400m sale of debt securities by Marriott in
early 1992, and alleged the company knew the spin-off plan was being
prepared even as it was selling the new notes.
Apart from PPM America - acting on behalf of Jackson National Life Company,
the Pru's US life-insurance subsidiary - 14 institutions were named as
plaintiffs. Together, they claimed 'the market value of the shareholdings of
the Marriott family increased more than Dollars 47m,' as a result of the
plan, 'while the aggregate value of the plaintiffs' notes declined in excess
of Dollars 35m'.
Then, in late-December, Marriott announced it was talking to several
bondholders, represented by Goldman Sachs, in the hope of 'advancing the
company's objectives' while making the deal more attractive to investors.
It is these talks which Marriott now says are close to a resolution. Details
of the impending agreement have not been released, but it seems likely the
pact would involve shifting a larger portion of the debt to Marriott
International and, perhaps, enlarging the Dollars 600m credit facility that
Marriott International would provide to Host Marriott.
The problem is that the lengthy negotiations have resulted in a split in
bondholders' ranks. While the 'Goldman' bondholders have been negotiating
with Marriott, the PPM America group has been preparing to litigate over the
demerger scheme - and, so far, the 'litigating' bondholders do not like what
they have heard about the proposed deal.
'Without being specifically aware of the proposed settlement terms, my
general understanding is that it doesn't respond to our requirements,' says
Mr John Stark, PPM America's general counsel.
Mr Stark is quite clear what PPM wants. First, it is seeking to restore the
bonds' credit quality; second, it wants the bonds to return to their 'full
trading value'. For the latter demand to be satisfied, Mr Stark claims the
bonds would need to trade at around 113; the likely Marriott-Goldman deal,
he argues, would barely return them to par.
Meanwhile, S&amp;P's made clear on Monday that although a transfer of between
Dollars 350m and Dollars 700m of debt from Host Marriott to Marriott
International might improve the bond ratings, it would be unlikely to lift
them from a 'low to mid-speculative grade'.
PPM has a broader point to make, arguing that dangerous precedents, eroding
bondholders' protection, are being set, and this could be part of a worrying
trend.
It points to recent prospectuses for debt offering from Lockheed and
Tiphook. These included a clause saying the company's covenants to
bondholders might have 'limited, if any applicability, in the event of a
highly-leveraged transaction or leveraged buy-out initiated or supported by
the company.'
Such language, PPM notes, is either new in investment grade offerings or, at
the very least, more prominently presented. The Securities and Exchange
Commission says it knows of no recent rule change which might have triggered
the new language, although full disclosure is an age-old policy.
Posturing is a familiar feature of US corporate wrangles. But, so far,
everyone is sticking to their guns. PPM America says it plans to file an
expanded suit against Marriott this week, alleging fraudulent conveyance.
Marriott is seeking to have the litigation dismissed next month, and is
sticking to its mid-1993 timetable for the demerger. Battle has been joined.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO most important holding companies in Canada's Edper-Hees group
reported sharply lower profits for 1992 because of provisions to cover their
exposure to troubled Royal Trustco and other units in the group.
Hees International Bancorp's profit fell to CDollars 36.3m (USDollars 29.4m)
from CDollars 178.4m in 1991, after a special CDollars 91.4m provision. Hees
International is at the top of the Edper Bronfman empire.
Brascan, the other holding company, reported a loss of CDollars 113.4m after
provisions, against a CDollars 17.7m loss in 1991.
Both companies have significant holdings in Trilon Financial, which in turn
controls Royal Trustco, Canada's second-biggest trust company, which is
negotiating to sell most of its business to Royal Bank of Canada.
Trilon reported a nine-month loss of CDollars 227m but has yet to report for
the whole year. Royal Trustco has delayed its full-year results until talks
with the Royal Bank are completed.
Edper-Hees also controls London Life, the depressed property developers
Carena, Trizec and Bramalea, and Canada's biggest resource group, Noranda.
Its controlling stake in John Labatt, the brewer, was sold last month for
nearly CDollars 1bn. The Hees provision included its share of charges made
by the property units.

DU PONT, the US chemicals group, is accelerating the phase-out of
chlorofluorocarbon production in developed countries by one year to the end
of 1994, Reuter reports from Wilmington.
Du Pont said in 1988 it would phase out CFC production as soon as possible.
Since then, it said, alternative technologies had been developed, adequate
supplies of alternatives were available, and atmospherics measurements
continued to confirm that ozone losses will increase. Refrigeration and air
conditioning account for almost half of CFC use. About 80 per cent of the
refrigerants Du Pont sells are used to service existing equipment.
Existing systems originally designed to use CFCs cannot use any known
alternatives as a direct, drop-in replacement without modification or
redesign.
Du Pont said it expected there would be sufficient alternatives capacity
worldwide for the transition.

DELL Computer, the US personal computer manufacturer, yesterday unveiled its
fourth consecutive quarter of sales growth in excess of 100 per cent.
Net income for the fourth quarter more than doubled to Dollars 31.3m, or 77
cents per share, from Dollars 15.4m, or 41 cents, while Dell reported sales
of Dollars 620.3m, a rise of 117 per cent on Dollars 285.7m in the same
period last year. International sales rose 103 per cent to Dollars 242m in
the fourth quarter.
'This has been an excellent quarter and a banner year for Dell,' said Mr
Michael Dell, chairman and chief executive. 'We doubled our annual revenues
to Dollars 2bn, more than doubled our market share and emerged as the
third-largest IBM-compatible personal computer company in the world.'
Net income for the year rose to Dollars 102m, or Dollars 2.59, up from
Dollars 51m, or Dollars 1.40 in fiscal 1992.
Dell sells personal computers direct to users, by-passing dealers and
retailers.
Sales to corporate, government and education accounts increased 132 per cent
to Dollars 302m in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1993, compared with Dollars
130m in the same period in the previous year. Sales to small to medium-sized
businesses and individuals rose sharply to Dollars 248m, up 128 per cent.

FT  10 MAR 93 / CNBC targets Europe and Asia for expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CNBC, the NBC cable television channel that specialises in business news, is
planning to expand in Europe and eastern Asia.
The 24-hour channel carries around 12 hours a day of programmes devoted to
Wall Street, supplemented by consumer and other news.
Several individual CNBC programmes are already broadcast to Europe on Super
Channel, the pan-European channel which claims it is available in around 50m
homes. CNBC is expected to announce today significant expansion of
programming carried on Super Channel.
CNBC, available in 48m homes in the US, is also considering significant
expansion in Asia by joining a satellite system there.
The CNBC move is the latest example of US cable television programmers
expanding overseas, particularly Europe.
This week, Turner Broadcasting said it was launching its Cartoon Network and
Turner Network Television in Europe on the Astra satellite, while Viacom
said recently that it was introducing its Nickelodeon channel to Europe in a
joint venture with British Sky Television.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Renault truck arm tumbles
FFr1.62bn into the red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENAULT Vehicules Industriels, the French truckmaker, yesterday announced a
FFr1.62bn (Dollars 287m) net loss for 1992. Turnover fell by 8 per cent with
a 38 per cent drop in European sales in the second half.
Mr Jean-Pierre Capron, RVI president, said he hoped that balance might be
restored in the second half of this year. But as a measure of the depth of
the recession into which the European truck market had now fallen, he said
RVI's sales for both the last six months of 1992 and the first six months of
this year would only total what the company had sold in the first half of
1990 alone.
The only bright spot was the relative success of the US subsidiary, Mack
Trucks, in cutting its operating loss from Dollars 195m in 1991 to Dollars
145m last year. The US company had been set the goal, in a recovering
market, of returning to profit in 1994, Mr Capron said.
The group's FFr1.62bn net loss follows a FFr23m net profit in 1991, and
includes FFr612m worth of provisions to cover restructuring. This will cut
its French workforce by a further 1,348 jobs this year after 1,008 job
losses in 1992 and a decision to end vehicle assembly in the UK.
Mr Shemaya Levy, director of RVI's European operations, said that from its
1989 peak of 311,000 truck sales, the European truck market would fall from
260,000 last year to 220,000 this year.
Last year, RVI held its fourth position among European truck makers, but its
share fell from 10.5 per cent in 1991 to 9.2 per cent. This resulted from
the above-average decline in the French and Spanish markets where Renault is
particularly strong, and the fact that the French truckmaker is still trying
to expand in Germany, whose post-unification market last year accounted for
40 per cent of all sales in Europe.
'We have adjusted our production to a demand that almost vanished in the
second half of last year,' Mr Capron said. 'As a result, our operations
dwindled to a level we had never experienced in the past and that generated
considerably higher costs'.

FREIA Marabou, Scan-dinavia's leading chocolate, sugar confectionery and
snacks producer, reported a 4.5 per cent increase in 1992 pre-tax profit to
NKr534m (Dollars 75.82m) from NKr512m in 1991, despite weaker sales.
Last autumn, Kraft General Foods International paid Dollars 1.5bn in a
friendly takeover of Freia, but approval by the Norwegian authorities is not
expected until the beginning of April.
Freia's sales slipped last year to NKr5.38bn from NKr5.40bn as operating
costs dipped to NKr4.62bn from NKr4.63bn. Investments reached a record
NKr629m in 1992 against NKr466m in 1991.
Group operating profit slipped to NKr520m in 1992 from NKr548m in 1991. Net
financial items showed a substantial improvement from a loss of NKr36m in
1991 to a gain of NKr14m last year. Freia attributed the improvement to
earnings from sales of shares, currency gains and increased interest income
derived from restructuring of the biscuits sector.

<TEXT>
ATLAS Copco, the Swedish industrial and engineering group, has strengthened
its position within rock excavation technology by buying Robbins Company of
the US, the world's largest supplier of hard rock tunnel boring machines.
The acquisition, on undisclosed financial terms, will result in Robbins
becoming part of the Atlas Copco Rocktech Division.
Mr Michael Treschow, Atlas Copco president, said the deal emphasised the
company's commitment to rock excavation technology and expanded its product
range. It also assisted the company's goal of becoming the world's leading
company within its specialist areas of business.
Robbins is based in Kent, Washington, and has annual revenues of Dollars
70m. The company played a leading role in the development of tunnel boring
machines.
It supplied five of the 11 tunnel boring machines being used in the Channel
tunnel project between England and France.
'Atlas Copco brings the capital necessary to accelerate the rate of our
technological developments,' said Mr Richard Robbins, president and chief
executive of Robbins.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Four KIO executives in US to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON, Banking Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office, the international investment arm of the gulf
state, has made redundant the four executives who have run its Dollars 2bn
US property operations for the past decade.
Mr Ali-Rashid al-Bader, chairman of one of the world's powerful investors
with a portfolio worth around Dollars 20bn, said the four executives, led by
Mr Michael Puglisi, had been made redundant in a 'cost-cutting programme'.
The four - who include Mr Richard Della Pietra, Mr Richard Battista and Mr
Luis Pomponio - were executives of Fosterlane Holdings, a KIO-owned US
company. Their departure follows Mr Saleh Al-Zouman's appointment in January
as chairman of Fosterlane's management company.
Kuwait is one of the 20 biggest investors in US properties. Most of its
properties are owned by a network of companies controlled by Fosterlane.
It has maintained a veil of secrecy over its US properties. Tenants often
have no idea buildings are owned by the KIO. But it has invested around
Dollars 2bn in US properties, often in partnership with Mr Gerald Hines, the
US property investor. It controls well-known US buildings, including New
York's 'Lipstick Building', at the corner of 53rd street and 3rd Avenue,
Chase Manhattan's offices at 350 Park Avenue, 101 California in San
Francisco, and the Dallas Galleria. It also owns 40 per cent of the General
Motors Building in New York.
The four departing executives are understood to have three-year contracts
and will continue to receive their salaries, estimated at more than Dollars
1m a year in aggregate, for that period.
Mr al-Bader said their departure reflected a basic change of approach by the
KIO in managing its property portfolio. Rather than expand this portfolio,
the KIO would realise investments when it could.
He said that this was part of its new worldwide investment strategy, which
aims to convert illiquid investments, such as property, into more liquid
holdings, because the costs of the 1991 Gulf war depleted the KIO's liquid
reserves.
An executive with a close knowledge of the KIO said St Martins Property
Corporation, the KIO's UK property company, was likely to make substantial
property disposals. St Martins owns London Bridge City, one of the biggest
Thameside developments in London.
Mr al-Bader added there could also be redundancies at the KIO's London
headquarters, although no decision had been taken.

FT  10 MAR 93 / International Company News: Trygg-Hansa swings into deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRYGG-HANSA SPP, the leading Swedish insurance group, swung to a SKr5.2bn
(Dollars 682m) loss in 1992 from a SKr531m profit a year earlier after
suffering more than SKr6bn in losses through its exposure to three bankrupt
Swedish companies.
The group had large holdings in Gota AB (the holding company for Gota Bank)
and two collapsed credit insurers, Svenska Kredit and International Credit,
which were written down to zero at a total cost of SKr6.03bn.
It also suffered from a negative reinsurance result and a further drop in
property values. As a result, the company scrapped its dividend after paying
out SKr4 per share in 1991.
The insurance result halved to SKr500m from SKr1.01bn, even though premiums
rose 14 per cent to SKr8.53bn.
The group blamed its reinsurance operations for the fall, saying the impact
of Hurricane Andrew and credit losses caused a reinsurance deficit of
'several hundred million krona,' compared with a SKr28m profit in 1991.
The group is to cut its reinsurance business by 50 per cent this year,
sharply reducing its catastrophe exposure but also reducing its activity in
a number of European markets and business areas. In 1992, reinsurance
premiums totalled SKr2.5bn.
'We have made this move because we do not regard reinsurance as a core
business and it was becoming too costly to buy retrocession protection,'
said Mr Lars Pihlgren, head of Trygg's reinsurance and marine operations.
A consolation for the group was the revival in share prices towards the end
of the year, which pushed up the group's solvency margin to 134 per cent at
the year end from 110 per cent at the eight-month stage.

to 29%

<TEXT>
DE BEERS, the South African company which dominates the world diamond
market, yesterday pleased investors by holding the cut in its 1992 dividend
to 29 per cent - to 79.1 cents from 112.1 cents - after announcing a 35 per
cent fall in earnings for the year.
Many analysts had predicted a much larger reduction in the payout. The
company's shares climbed after the announcement, closing at R68.85 (Dollars
21.61) - nearly 4 per cent up for the day.
Analysts agreed the size of the dividend cut indicated that De Beers'
financial health and the general state of the world diamond industry were
better than the market had expected.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said the fall in earnings reflected
the difficult second half. Attributable profits at De Beers and Centenary,
its offshore arm, fell by 49 per cent in the second half, compared with a 26
per cent fall in first.
Pre-tax profits on the diamond account fell by 20 per cent to Dollars 644m
from Dollars 801m in 1991 reflecting the impact of the quotas.
Net interest income slumped 79 per cent to Dollars 30m from Dollars 141m.
This was due to lower cash balances after the company bought up diamond
supplies that bypassed the Central Selling Organisation (CSO), the De Beers
company that trades 80 per cent of world rough diamond output.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson estimated that Dollars 500m to Dollars 600m worth of
diamonds which bypassed the CSO - both legal and illegal - had come from
Angola during the year, of which De Beers had bought about two-thirds.
Attributable earnings fell to Dollars 491m from Dollars 759m, while equity
accounted earnings fell to Dollars 757m from Dollars 1.07bn. Earnings per
share, excluding retained earnings of associates, fell 35 per cent to 129
cents from 200 cents.

<TEXT>
CARREFOUR, one of France's largest retailing groups, yesterday announced
that it had overcome its problems in the first half of last year to produce
a 10.6 per cent increase in net profits for the full year to FFr1.33bn
(Dollars 287m) in 1992 from FFr1.21bn in 1991.
The group which, like other French retailers, has been affected by the
sluggish economic environment saw net profits fall in the first half of
1992. The news of the decline triggered the resignation of Mr Michel Bon
who, as chairman, had orchestrated the company's expansion in the 1980s.
Carrefour continued to face difficult trading conditions in the second half
of last year. However, it managed to increase sales by 16.7 per cent to
FFr117.14bn in 1992 from FFr100.38bn in 1991. Euromarche, the hypermarket
group that Carrefour acquired in 1991, made a full-year's contribution to
the 1992 figures but contributed for only six months in 1991.
The board proposed raising the dividend for 1992 to FFr35, against FFr32.5
in the previous year. Carrefour benefited from a profit of FFr287m on the
sale of its Pyrca subsidiary but also made a special charge of FFr291m for
writing off goodwill on the Euromarche deal.
Mr Jacques Fournier, who succeeded Mr Bon as chairman last autumn, has
continued to sell off peripheral interests to raise capital for the group
which is now investing heavily in new technology and stock control systems.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAUNCH COSTS for two lines of chocolates slimmed profit margins at
Thorntons, the chocolate maker and retailer.
The shares fell 10p to 200p as the group announced pre-tax profits down 2
per cent, from Pounds 7.16m to Pounds 7.02m, for the half year to January 9.
Operating margins were eroded from 15 per cent to 14.1 per cent, mainly
because of the launch of the Select range and the relaunch of the
Continental products in the UK.
The group's UK retail operations achieved sales of Pounds 39.3m, up 9.6 per
cent on the previous year. Mr John Thornton, chairman and chief executive,
whose family owns 48 per cent of the shares, said profits were slightly
under expectations.
In the four weeks to Christmas, UK retail sales grew 8.3 per cent on the
previous year. The group said it was Pounds 750,000 short of stock.
The group's French subsidiary continued to make losses, although he said the
full-year figure might be less than last year's Pounds 750,000 deficit,
partly depending on currency fluctuations.
Sales in France rose to Pounds 5.3m (Pounds 4.6m). Interest payments
increased to Pounds 650,000 (Pounds 478,000) with net borrowings at the half
year of Pounds 4.8m. The group has suffered because of relatively high
French interest rates. Thorntons has between Pounds 7m and Pounds 8m in
French franc long term loans.
Capital spending increased to Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.7m). The group spent
Pounds 1m on shops, opening 30 more outlets in the UK bringing the total to
442. It opened two more shops in France. The group spent Pounds 3.2m (Pounds
1.4m) on plant.
Earnings per share slipped to 7.38p (7.53p).
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.25p.

A WEAKER pound helped Pict Petroleum, the oil exploration company, report a
surge in interim profits from Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 2.9m on turnover 19 per
cent lower at Pounds 4.8m, against Pounds 5.9m.
Mr John Lander, managing director, said currency gains had contributed
Pounds 1.4m, against last year's Pounds 442,000 loss, to pre-tax profits for
the six months to December 31.
The stronger dollar and weaker pound had also helped to offset a decline in
the oil price from Dollars 19.50 to Dollars 18.76 per barrel. Sterling
barrel rates averaged at Pounds 10.94, against Pounds 10.99 last year. Mr
Lander said the exchange rate was likely to continue to benefit the group in
the second half. 'With a stronger pound, if nothing goes wrong, it should be
a very good year-end,' he said.
Cash balances rose from Pounds 15.9m to Pounds 16.9m, helping to boost
interest income from Pounds 254,150 to Pounds 627,887.
Earnings were 5.66p (2.97p).

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambros Bank backs radio bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hambros Bank is backing a management-led bid for RFM, the French radio
network which went into receivership following the collapse of Crown
Communications.
The main contenders for the network are thought to be the management team
led by Mr Andrew Manderstam, who has run RFM since Crown took over in 1989,
and a consortium led by NRJ, a rival network.
Under the plan, which would involve financing of some Pounds 12m and an
immediate injection of Pounds 1m, Hambros European Ventures Development
would take 26 per cent of the equity. A media subsidiary of La Caisse de
Depots, the French government investment bank, would take 20 per cent.
The magazine L'Evenement de Jeudi would also take 20 per cent and the staff
would subscribe for a significant stake.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wates incurs Pounds 75m loss and omits
final pay-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATES CITY of London Properties, the property investment and development
group, yesterday reported a Pounds 74.9m pre-tax loss for 1992 and passed
its final dividend.
Net assets per share more than halved to 74.4p (151p).
The deficit, which compared with previous profits of Pounds 8.17m, largely
reflected the transfer of a net Pounds 71.9m deficit on the revaluation
reserve to the profit and loss account, coupled with a Pounds 8.77m loss
taken on the sale of two investment properties.
Net rental income increased by 5 per cent to Pounds 15.8m (Pounds 15m) but
interest payments climbed to Pounds 6.77m (Pounds 3.92m) and largely
accounted for the decline in profit before exceptional items to Pounds 5.77m
(Pounds 8.17m).
Losses per share of 60.91p compared with earnings of 4.33p. With the final
dividend omitted shareholders are left with a 0.77p for the year - for 1991
they received an interim of 0.77p and a final of 2.96p.
Reflecting the continuing decline in property values net assets fell from
Pounds 181.2m to Pounds 89.3m at the end of 1992. It was the third
consecutive year that net assets had fallen. The worst affected part of the
portfolio was development properties which again fell by 44 per cent, while
the overall value of investment properties dropped by 21 per cent.
At the year-end net borrowings stood at Pounds 90.9m (Pounds 91.2m),
representing gearing of 102 per cent. In December the group rearranged its
principal borrowings with a syndicate of four banks. The new five year
Pounds 85m facility, which is secured on some of the group's properties,
replaced a Pounds 105m facility which was due to be repaid in June next
year.
Commenting on the results Mr Dundas Hamilton, chairman, said: '1992 has been
without doubt the most difficult year in the history of the company.
'The failure of others in the property sector has led the banks to apply
increasingly stringent lending criteria. We are fortunate that the company
entered the recession with a relatively modest level of gearing.'
He added: 'There is some evidence that the worst of the recession is over.'

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: AJ Archer agrees to buy Castle Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AJ ARCHER Holdings, the quoted Lloyd's underwriter, has reached agreement to
acquire Castle Holdings. The association will form one of the largest agency
groups at the Lloyd's insurance market.
Castle shareholders will receive 12.5m Archer ordinary shares, valuing the
smaller group at about Pounds 5m.
The takeover will create an agency managing 15 syndicates, with a combined
capacity - or capital base - of Pounds 391m. Although the group will still
be significantly smaller than Sturge Holdings, the market leader with
managed capacity of more than Pounds 700m, it ranks alongside such agencies
as Merrett, Wellington and Murray Lawrence.
The agency will also handle the affairs of some 640 Lloyd's Names - the
individuals whose assets make up Lloyd's capital base - as a result of the
merger of its members' agency interests.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Close seeks funds for purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOSE BROTHERS yesterday embarked on its first cash call as it sought funds
for the Pounds 19m acquisition of Winterflood Securities, the small
companies marketmaker.
The merchant bank announced a placing and a 1-for-7 open offer of 5.5m
shares at 315p. This will raise Pounds 17.3m towards the acquisition of
Union Discount's 90.5 per cent stake in Winterflood and Pounds 3m in debt.
Close shares rose 4p to 344p.
Winterflood's management, led by Mr Brian Winterflood who set up the
business in 1988, will be granted incentives as part of the purchase
agreement.
These include options over 15 per cent of the marketmaker - which could
bring management's stake to almost 25 per cent - and 5 per cent of
Winterflood's profits up to Pounds 5m.
Mr Winterflood said the firm would be run as it always had been - 'with no
interference from big brother'. He has plans to expand the business
organically and through expansion in the jobbing sector.
Mr Peter Winkworth, an executive director of Close, said Winterflood would
be a 'very good strategic fit'.
Close also reported a 6.7 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 6.8m
for the six months to end-January.
The interim dividend is increased in line with profits from 3p to 3.2p.
Earnings per share rose from 11.56p to 11.91p.
The loan book was ahead 3 per cent at Pounds 285m.

<TEXT>
KERRY GROUP, Ireland's fast-growing milk and meat processing company,
reported a 19 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for 1992, from IPounds
24.1m to IPounds 28.7m (Pounds 29m), on turnover up 10 per cent to IPounds
826.7m, against IPounds 754.9m.
The results incorporated the first full-year contributions from a series of
1991 acquisitions, Kantoher, Meadow Meats and Tunney Meats in Ireland,
Dairyland Products in the US and Eastleigh Flavours, a UK food ingredients
company.
During 1992 the company acquired Buxted Duckling in the UK and Tuam Dairies
in Ireland.
Two thirds of the company's turnover is now from overseas. Meat processing
now accounts for 50 per cent of the group's business.
Turnover has nearly trebled since 1987, while earnings per share and pre-tax
profits have more than doubled and risen 3 1/2 times respectively in the
five years.
Earnings per share for 1992 rose 9 per cent to 15.8p (14.5p). A final
dividend of 1.47p (1.4p), is recommended making a total of 2.26p, compared
with 2.15p.
Mr Liam Igoe of Goodbody, the Dublin stockbroker, forecast 1993 earnings of
16.6p per share on pre-tax profits of IPounds 32.7m, although he said 'there
could be some upside on that due to the strength of the dollar'.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown rethinks expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HILLSDOWN Holdings' results bore the brunt of the group's earlier mistakes
made when it expanded rapidly through acquisitions.
Pre-tax profits dipped and a Pounds 92.3m provision was taken below the
line.
The group now plans a pause in such expansion for at least 12 months while
it concentrates on sorting out its existing operations. It will also close
or sell about 30 businesses.
Sales from continuing operations rose 6 per cent but total sales were down
6.1 per cent to Pounds 4.37bn.
Operating profits fell 20 per cent to Pounds 184.9m, though profits from
continuing businesses fell 12.2 per cent to Pounds 185.6m. Profits included
Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 10.6m) from fixed asset sales.
Operating profit margins fell as recession-hit consumers traded down.
A reduction in the interest charge from Pounds 44.9m to Pounds 30.8m
reflected the rights issue in November 1991.
The tax charge rose from 20.5 per cent to 25.9 per cent as unutilised tax
losses ran out.
The tax rate is expected to rise to about 30 per cent in 1993. The group is
also facing an advance corporation tax problem but hopes to avoid paying any
irrecoverable ACT this year.
Minorities fell from Pounds 25m to Pounds 20.3m, reflecting lower profits in
Canada and at Strong &amp; Fisher.
With the extra shares in issue, earnings per share fell from 21p to 13.6p.
An unchanged final dividend of 6.6p gives a maintained 8.8p total.
Food processing operating profits fell 10 per cent to Pounds 123.4m, with
mixed results from the range of activities.
The fresh meat and bacon division suffered a 60 per cent profit fall to
Pounds 12.8m as lower volumes hit the commodity end of the business. Poultry
and egg profits rose 3.8 per cent to Pounds 27.3m.
In non-food activities, furniture profits were ahead from Pounds 12.6m to
Pounds 14.8m. Profits from housebuilding property and specialist activities
fell 59 per cent to Pounds 11.6m.
Pre-tax profits of Strong &amp; Fisher (Holdings), the leather and by-products
group 70.3 per cent owned by Hillsdown, were below expectations at Pounds
2.23m after exceptional debits of Pounds 562,000.
The previous accounting period covered 18 months when pre-tax profits were
Pounds 2.43m after an exceptional debit of Pounds 4.55m. Sales were Pounds
83.6m (Pounds 114.6m).
There was a tax credit of Pounds 491,000 from the release of an unused
provision. Fully diluted earnings per share were 1.05p (0.54p).
The annual dividend is unchanged at 1p.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fleming Emerging to raise Pounds 50m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor

<TEXT>
FLEMING Emerging Markets, the specialist investment trust, is attempting to
raise Pounds 50m to take advantage of what it sees as increasing investment
opportunities in developing economies.
The trust has conditionally placed 37.5m shares and is offering a further
12.5m shares to existing share and warrantholders by way of an offer for
subscription.
The shares are C shares, which will bear the costs of the issue and so
ensure that no dilution is suffered by existing holders. When the bulk of
the proceeds are invested, the C shares will be converted into ordinary
shares at asset value.
The offer will close on March 31 and it is expected that dealings in the new
shares will start on April 6.
Emerging markets are seen as attractive investments because they have higher
rates of economic growth and underdeveloped stock markets, and because many
governments are liberalising their investment regulations. Templeton
Emerging Markets Investment Trust is also considering raising new funds.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Maple Leaf moves ahead 16%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Maple Leaf Foods, the food processing group 56 per cent owned by Hillsdown,
reported profits of CDollars 69.2m (Pounds 38.8m), or 86 cents a share, for
1992, up 16 per cent, writes Robert Gibbens.
Sales were CDollars 2.8bn, down slightly reflecting the group's withdrawal
from the beef business.
Fourth-quarter profit from continuing operations was CDollars 17.8m, or 22
cents a share, against CDollars 19.4m, or 25 cents a share, on sales little
changed at CDollars 739m.
The company said disposals, heavy investment in facilities and rising
efficiency had created a sound base for future growth in Canada and the US.

FT  10 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambros to raise Pounds 35m in HIS float
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD LAPPER

<TEXT>
Hambros, the merchant banking group, expects to raise Pounds 35m by floating
its insurance business, Hambros Insurance Services, later this month,
according to the pathfinder prospectus issued yesterday.
HIS will receive Pounds 15m, before expenses, of the proceeds, of which
Pounds 2.5m will be used to reduce short-term debt. The remainder represents
the sale of shares by Hambros and minority shareholders. Hambros will retain
a 50 per cent holding.
Turnover of the four companies which make up HIS - Cunningham Hart, the loss
adjusters, Hambro Legal Protection, the legal expenses insurer, Beale Dobie,
a market maker in second hand endowment policies, and Berkeley Insurance, a
London market consultancy - increased to Pounds 56.6m (Pounds 38.5m) in the
12 months to March 31 1992.
The issue will be underwritten by Panmure Gordon, brokers to HIS.
