FT  08 MAR 93 / The bogeyman will be back
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the British government's latest reprieve in the interminable struggle
over Maastricht in the House of Commons, it begins to look as if the treaty
may eventually be ratified. If that should be the outcome  - the battle is
far from over - it would be a realistic but unenthusiastic expression of the
balance of opinion in parliament. Many of its members dislike aspects of the
treaty, but only a small minority dislike the whole thing so passionately
that they welcome the opportunity to challenge Britain's membership of the
European Community.
The conclusion of the ratification process would therefore be a relief all
round; but it would not be the end of the story.
If the government imagines that the controversy over the objectives of
Maastricht will be put to sleep by ratification, it is deluding itself.
Europe has long been a malicious bogeyman for the British, and it will leap
right out at them again, not in some distant future, but immediately and
repeatedly; and it will continue its haunting until the day (if it ever
comes) when the British political establishment finally resolves its
ambivalent feelings about the European Community, one way or another.
Second, the surreal procedural by-ways along which the House of Commons is
crawling towards ratification must raise questions about the credibility of
those very constitutional arrangements of national sovereignty which the
British Euro-sceptics so fervently profess to defend.
Last week provided a striking example of official procedural jiggery-pokery.
The Labour party had fashioned an amendment attacking the government's
opt-out from the treaty's social chapter. Through a de facto alliance
between Labour and the Euro-sceptics, it looked as though this amendment
might bring down the treaty. But lo and behold, the government was
miraculously saved because the deputy speaker ruled that the amendment was
out of order. He gave no explanation, but his reason was said to be that the
amendment was unacceptable because it was critical of the treaty. This
interpretation is bizarre, perverse, incredible; which does not mean that it
is not true.
Even without Maastricht, the case for constitutional reform was already on
the agenda, at least for the Labour party and the Liberal Democrats. Mr John
Smith, the Labour leader, last week set out a long list of desirable
reforms, including the election of the House of Lords, protection of human
rights and freedom of information.
But Mr Smith's list also included reforms to bring Britain up to date in its
constitutional relationship with Europe. The restoration of strong local
government, and the creation of strong regional government, may have their
own domestic justification; but Mr Smith also argued the case as part of a
four-tier European structure of government, of which the nation-state would
be only one tier.
As it happens, the Maastricht treaty will require the establishment of a
committee of the regions, to which each member state will nominate a
national contingent. This will be simple for Germany, France, Spain or
Italy, because they have regional governments of various kinds. But it will
be a poser in Britain, which has no regional governments in England, and
only paternalistic substitutes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
In any case, British ratification is not the end of a story, just the
beginning. Before the end of this year we shall be plunged into a new debate
on the objectives of the treaty; before the middle of next year, we shall be
engaged in renegotiating it; and that means we shall have to go through
parliamentary ratification again.
First, there is bound to be a far-reaching reassessment of the credibility
of the programme for economic and monetary union. It cannot easily take
place in public until there is complete ratification, for fear of
frightening the voters or encouraging the speculators; but it may be
precipitated if the next French government presses for an accelerated
rapprochement with Germany.
Second, the negotiations for the admission of new member states, starting
with the west European candidates from Efta, are bound to set off a serious
re-examination of the general objectives of the treaty, and in particular
its institutional arrangements.
Ostensibly, the candidates will disclaim any demand for British or
Danish-type opt-outs. They can hardly avoid a debate about the treaty's
long-term aims.
The institutional question will be more controversial. At present, the
weighted votes in the Council of Ministers are heavily skewed in favour of
the smaller member states, in comparison with their share of EC population.
Officially, the Community has disclaimed any desire to change the voting
weights. The candidates would join with the same votes as comparable
existing members.
The problem is that all present candidates, and almost all future
candidates, are small countries. The official position is really just a
polite fiction which must be kept up until Denmark's second referendum on
May 18. But the voting weights must be changed, because the big countries
will not agree to the progressive domination of the small, especially since
the political commitment of the new members is at least open to question.
In logic, the small countries should demand some political compensation for
a cut in their votes; this could take the form either of a strengthening of
the role of the European Parliament, or of an increase in unweighted
majority voting. Either way, the enlargement treaty, which must be ratified
in parliament, will pose a serious dilemma for the British government.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Politics in the age of the microchip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It matters that Mr Al Gore, America's vice president, cares passionately
about technology. One of the peculiarities of modern politics is that most
politicians spend most of their time on issues that have little or no
bearing on the future prosperity of their nations. Diplomacy, for example,
continues to outrank economics and finance, which in turn outrank science
and technology. Yet we are living in the age of the microchip not the age of
Metternich. Since the great depression, technological change (something
beyond the ken of diplomats and economists) is reckoned to have accounted
for about two thirds of the rise in global living standards.
One reason for being confident about America's long-term future is the
attention it is now paying to technology. The Clinton-Gore policy paper
Technology for America's Economic Growth signals a fundamental shift in US
priorities. During the cold war, technology policy was driven by a desire to
maintain a military lead over the former Soviet Union. The US ploughed huge
sums into two areas - basic science and defence research and development. By
any standards, the policy was a resounding success. US academics head the
Nobel prize lists in every category of basic science while the Pentagon
enjoys a near monopoly of the world's smartest weapons.
But with US industrial dominance taken for granted, no attention was paid to
economic competitiveness. Last year only 2 per cent of the Dollars 73bn
federal R&amp;D budget was spent on projects relevant to manufacturing industry.
Total spending on civilian R&amp;D accounted for only 1.9 per cent of national
income, against 2.7 per cent in Germany and 3.0 per cent in Japan.
The Clinton administration is determined to make industrial expansion the
main goal of federal technology policy. Free market economists are making
the predictable response, which is that the lure of big profits will always
be the most effective spur to commercial innovation. They are correct, but
they are wrong to imply there is nothing government can do to help. Many of
the most important technologies of the 20th century, including computers and
jet engines, were initially wholly dependent on the public purse.
The Clinton-Gore technology plan is deliberately modest in scope and seems
to avoid many of the pitfalls of old-style industrial policies. It envisages
additional spending of only Dollars 17bn over four years - hardly an
irresponsible goal. It recognises that the military R&amp;D machine can be wound
down only gradually. The civilian share of the federal R&amp;D budget is
projected to rise from about 40 per cent to just over 50 per cent by 1998.
Over time, the network of 700 federal laboratories will be expected to
devote up to 20 per cent of their budgets to R&amp;D partnerships with industry,
against less than 5 per cent today.
The strategy admittedly does not entirely avoid the error of trying to pick
winners - Washington wants to help US industry develop new 'clean car'
technologies. But the single biggest boost to civilian innovation is a
research and experimentation tax credit worth about Dollars 2bn a year which
will not discriminate between different sectors.
There are, moreover, at least two big ideas that could pay off handsomely.
The first is the national network of 'information superhighways' long
championed by Mr Gore. Drawing an analogy with publicly subsidised railways
in the 19th century, Mr Gore believes that huge productivity gains will be
possible if all businesses, government agencies, schools and households can
ultimately be linked in a national fibre optic grid. The plan is to provide
modest subsidies for groups wanting to tap into such a communications
network, thus giving the private sector an incentive to accelerate plans for
its construction. As with the big infrastructure projects of the past,
information superhighways could spur a new generation of commercial
technologies.
The other big idea also draws on an historical parallel. US farms achieved
huge gains in productivity this century partly as a result of agricultural
'extension' services that ensured rapid dissemination of new technologies
and management techniques. Building on past pilot projects, the Clinton
administration wants to create a national network of manufacturing extension
centres to make sure that the nation's 360,000 small and medium-sized
manufacturers have access to the latest technologies and training
techniques.
The Clinton-Gore plan will also promote so-called 'agile manufacturing'
programmes and 'regional technology alliances'. The idea is to use the
flexible corporate relationships pioneered in dynamic regions such as
Silicon Valley as a template for general industrial development. It will
thus encourage the formation of regional clusters or networks of companies
and research institutes to share information and jointly develop new
products and markets.
The Clinton administration's attempt to reorient US federal science and
technology policy is still at the embryonic stage. But it would be a mistake
to assume it will be counter-productive just because interventionist
policies have a mixed record in Europe and Japan. On the contrary, what is
now happening in the US may well become a model for a new breed of
intelligent industrial policies - that is if politicians wake up to the
importance of science.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Monday Interview: No time like the present - Edzard Reuter,
chairman of Daimler-Benz, talks to Christopher Parkes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, has been preaching revolution for
years. Now he has decided that the time and the conditions are right for
action. Off his soapbox and up in arms, he has set about transforming the
strategy and culture of Germany's biggest industrial group.
'We now have the impression that the time has come when we can really
implement radical changes of a dimension and kind we had perceived as
necessary earlier,' he says.
Appropriately enough, his more public actions have been focused on the elite
Mercedes-Benz car division. This is to expand 'horizontally' in its upmarket
niche, he says. The traditional range will be extended with a leisure
vehicle, a people carrier, and a new compact car below the current
entry-level 190 series, and embellished with more coupe versions of the
existing models.
If not quite revolutionary, he insists that the switch is nonetheless a
'very courageous adaptation' which should not be seen as an attempt to clash
head-on with typical full-range manufacturers. 'We would never try to get
our fingers into the mass production business,' he promises.
In one sense, Mercedes will remain as it was: 'A car producer in the upper
market bracket, aiming at well-to-do customers, producing the
highest-quality cars at the highest technical level - but at a price
affordable to the necessary number of people.' As a result, unit output will
increase 'quite visibly'.
Strategy has changed because markets and the world have changed, he says.
'Competition in our traditional market segment has increased dramatically.
We have to face worldwide competition from people working on different cost
assumptions and in different situations.'
These are the factors steering the group's change of direction and which
have obliged Mercedes in the first instance to reject the ancient dogma
which insisted that its cars must always bear the 'Made in Germany' label.
'These additional vehicles probably have important markets outside Germany
or even outside Europe. This means that for exchange rate reasons alone we
needed to consider producing abroad,' he says.
Accordingly, there is a fair chance that a decision will be made later this
year to build leisure vehicles in the US, Reuter adds. Meanwhile,
small-scale car assembly is just starting up in Mexico. A joint venture with
Ssangyong in Korea could also extend the brand's reach into new markets.
People carriers, compact cars and installing capacity close to markets are
hardly new concepts, and Reuter admits Mercedes has been late to move
because it was hobbled by dogma.
But that was only part of the problem, and rejection of fixed ideas is only
part of Reuter's response. Throughout the group he has implemented measures
to slice through the bulky bureaucracy built up since the second world war,
and decentralise the entire business. 'We want to give more responsibility
to more people and ask them to participate in the success of the company
themselves,' he says.
Such moves lie at the heart of the revolution which has been waiting until
now to happen. Again, they are hardly new, but Reuter's ability to introduce
them has been hampered in the past by the difficulties of pinpointing the
moment when there was the best chance of achieving the necessary
company-wide consensus - one element in German management practice which
remains inviolable.
'Lean management used in this context is only a very rough description of
what is going on - what we are aiming at is a change of behaviour,' he says.
Postwar German attitudes to work and responsibility have been conditioned by
continuous economic growth, occasionally interrupted by very short periods
of slowdown, he notes. 'At the same time, there has been a steady increase
in well-being. That apparently has come to an end for the time being.'
The arrival of recession, heralded by the group's announcement last year of
the loss of almost 40,000 jobs, has fulfilled one of the conditions
necessary for Daimler's domestic revolution - and possibly for sweeping
changes in attitudes throughout the rest of German industry and society.
The slump's coincidence with growing awareness of the international
competitive threat to Germany, plus the harsh economic realities of
unification have 'added to the general feeling that things have to change',
he says.
Now that his strategy is clearly defined, he is talking again, taking his
soapbox to every level of the company, 'talking to hundreds of people, for
hours and hours . . . talking and taking decisions. But decisions alone are
not enough,' he admits. 'People must understand the necessity to change
their behaviour. I may be over-optimistic, but I think this company is on
its way.'
Other companies are moving, too. By the end of 1994, he says, the German
motor industry will employ 300,000 fewer workers. He insists that
rationalisation has to be accepted in Germany as a 'normal development', but
he refuses to speculate on the political implications of rising
unemployment.
'All I can say is we need an economic policy aimed at growth.' He seems to
despair of such action from Bonn where he sees 'a vacuum caused by the
sudden impact of unification and the drama of the economic collapse'.
Government failure to develop convincing measures has led to politicians
losing all credibility, he says. Instead, he turns hopefully to Europe.
'Look at France. The economic, political and unemployment situation is at
least as tense as in Germany. Look at Italy, not to mention the UK.'
No individual government has been able to find answers. Protectionism is out
of the question and any government trying to buy its way out of trouble by
spending huge amounts of public money risks ruining its country. 'There is
no alternative. The answer must be that we press on to economic and monetary
unification. But the Community must also talk seriously about an industrial
policy. The root of our problems lies in the lack of convincing European
solutions,' he says.
Reuter dislikes the dirigiste ring of the term 'industrial policy'. But, he
insists, 'one will never be able to find a perfect way of running a free
market without any kind of framework'.
Indispensable elements would include common income and value-added tax
systems, a regional policy to iron out structural economic distortions such
as imbalances in employment patterns, and a joint, measured approach to
research and development.
'I am talking about a market economy governed by a pragmatic, professional
approach . . . We need further policy co-ordination and this can only be
achieved with a common European currency,' he concludes.
With his unshaken belief in the capacities of European integration and
frustrated by the lack of activity and even comprehension in Bonn, Reuter
appears for the moment a lonely figure. But on the basis of the popular
belief that what is good for Daimler is good for Germany, and the more
reassuring premise that he has the full support of Deutsche Bank (Daimler's
biggest shareholder and the leading power broker across the upper reaches of
German industry), he is unlikely to be short of followers for long.
An admirer describes him as 'a true architect of German culture', which
probably suits this modest intellectual better than the 'revolutionary' tag.
But like a true revolutionary, Reuter has recognised that timing is
everything. Those who get it wrong - be they in politics or business - are
the ones whose heads finish up in the basket.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: After the payroll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange dealers will focus their attention on this week's US
economic indicators, following a remarkable employment report released last
Friday, writes James Blitz.
The non-farm payroll report showed a rise of 365,000 in February, against
market expectations of, at best, 150,000. This has led dealers to think that
the US economy is showing signs of maintaining its recovery from recession.
Some analysts were reluctant at the weekend to set too much store by this
latest figure, because around 90 per cent of the rise reflects an increase
in people doing part-time jobs.
The market will therefore look for further indications of an upturn in the
US economy in Thursday's retail sales figure for February. The market is
expecting a monthly rise of around 0.3 per cent. Friday's University of
Michigan survey of consumer confidence will also be screened closely.
Currency trading in the European exchange rate mechanism should be calmer
this week, following the Bundesbank's surprise cut in its repo rate on
Friday. However, dealers will closely scrutinise the latest stage of the
solidarity talks in Germany, the successful conclusion of which is seen as
an important requirement for an aggressive easing of policy.
On Thursday and Friday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl will meet the heads of
Germany's regions for talks on how to reduce the German budget deficit.
The solidarity pact is unlikely to be completed for some time yet. But a
successful agreement on how to divide up the cost of developing the eastern
part of the country between the government and the regions could encourage
the Bundesbank council to ease its official interest rates when it next
meets on March 18.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Revival of investor interest in Latin
America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN APPETITE for extra yield, at a time when low interest rates are squeezing
returns, has encouraged investors to return to the market for Latin American
bonds. Although the market is noted for its volatility, the relatively
strong economic performance of the region in the last few years has ensured
a steady tightening of yield spreads relative to the US Treasury market.
The market suffered a setback at the end of last year, when oversupply
caused yield margins to widen substantially. However, those wider margins,
reviewed at the start of the year, started to attract investors back to the
market.
The range of investors has already broadened considerably. Initially
dominated by flight capital - funds invested by Colombian nationals - the
market has been taken up by a growing number of specialist funds.
Institutions are starting to dip their toes in the water, buying Latin
American securities as a small part of large and diversified portfolios.
In the meantime, the number of sovereign borrowers able to tap the market
continues to grow, as the re-entry of Latin American countries to the
international capital markets progresses, in the wake of the debt crisis of
the early 1980s.
Uruguay, which completed its first Eurobond last year, is about to return to
the market with a five-year deal, arranged by Chase Investment Bank, which
is expected to yield about 295 basis points over the five-year US Treasury.
Colombia will make its debut in early April, with a Dollars 100m issue of
five or seven-year Eurobonds, via Bankers Trust. The deal for Colombia,
which never rescheduled its debt, has already attracted strong investor
interest, bankers said.
Some bankers believe that Peru - or a government-owned company - may also
tap the market this year, after having implemented a number of economic
reforms last year. Ecuador is also cited as a potential new borrower.
However, bankers have become increasingly frustrated in their efforts to
bring Chilean borrowers to the market. The government has clamped down on
foreign borrowing, barring banks from tapping the market and restricting all
but a few companies. 'Every time you get a mandate, the Chilean authorities
change the rules, effectively blocking the market,' complained one banker.
Chile has an active domestic market, where funding of up to 20 years is
available, but the amounts are small. In addition, banks are keen to raise
dollars in the international market to on-lend to companies for their export
business. However, CTC, the Chilean telecommunications company, is said to
be preparing a convertible bond issue via Goldman Sachs.
Borrowers are also beginning to tap markets other than the dollar market.
Venezuela is said to be planning a DM350m-DM400m issue of five-year bonds
via Commerzbank (having just issued three-year dollar bonds in the domestic
Colombian market). Apasco, a foreign-owned Mexican cement company, is also
planning to tap the D-Mark sector, via Dresdner, according to bankers. A
number of deals are also in the pipeline in the dollar market, including
issues for Argentine and Brazilian banks.
There is still some bad news about, however. Sentiment on Brazil is
increasingly negative, although last week's change of finance minister did
not worry the market. Bankers are concerned about the financial position of
the country and some companies, and fear the signing of the Brady plan on
debt restructuring may still be some way off.
In addition, although spreads can tighten dramatically in this market, when
they become too narrow the incentive to buy riskier paper disappears. In
recent weeks, corporate paper, which had been trading at rather wide
spreads, has prompted most interest. For example, seven-year Cemex paper
tightened from 450 basis points to 380, because it was perceived to offer a
high yield.
The market's volatility still scares off some investors. Part of the
problem, according to some specialists, is that relatively few banks are
active in this area, and they may not allocate substantial capital to
dealing in Latin American bonds.
However, there are signs that more banks are deciding that Latin American
business is worth getting. For example, Deutsche Bank, which has not been an
active arranger of Latin American bonds, recently managed a D-Mark issue for
Mexico.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: An unprecedented performance by the UK's
fund managers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS measuring the performance of fund managers becoming as much an art as
fund management itself? New figures due this week from Combined Actuarial
Performance Services, the Leeds-based pension fund performance measurement
service, are likely to stir the debate further.
According to CAPS, the average UK fund manager outperformed the FT-A
All-Share Index by a best-ever 1.8 percentage points, earning a median
return of 22.4 per cent on a portfolio of UK equities against a 20.6 per
cent return on the FT-A.
Meanwhile, WM Company, another pension fund measurement service, calculates
that the average return generated by institutional fund managers in UK
equities was 20.8 per cent, although half the funds in its survey beat the
index by one percentage point or more.
The outperformance seen in the CAPS data is unprecedented, says Mr John
Clamp, chief executive. Between 1982 and 1991, fund managers actually
underperformed the FT-A Index in seven of 10 years by an average of 0.89 per
cent. They outperformed in only three years, by a more modest average of
0.66 per cent. Similarly, the WM survey finds that fund managers had, for
the first time in 1992, outperformed key indices in every stock market at
home and abroad.
So what is going on? And if rates of return can be so different, what is the
appropriate benchmark against which to measure performance? These questions
prove particularly troublesome to pension fund consultants who guide clients
into the arms of fund managers.
Mr Nick Fitzpatrick, partner at actuarial consultants Bacon and Woodrow,
notes that partly because of the role of pension consultants, there has been
an increasing concentration of pension funds in the hands of no more than a
half-dozen fund managers with consistently good performance. Several of
these - Gartmore and Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management in particular - wildly
outperformed the FT-A Index in 1992 and the outperformance of the CAPS
median may well reflect the concentration of CAPS clients in the hands of
these managers.
But others suggest that differences in actual fund size account for the
variations in returns.
Mr Peter Worrington, marketing manager at WM, notes that his company
measures returns of 2,500 funds including several in-house managed funds of
more than Pounds 1bn. Because of their size, many of these maintain an
actual or de facto indexed core whose returns will be much closer to that of
the FT-A Index. Any outperformance will be achieved in smaller satellite
funds.
In contrast, the CAPS survey covers 1,700 pension funds with an average size
of Pounds 120m and only 3 per cent of which are more than Pounds 500m. These
pools are more likely to eschew indexation, assigning mandates which pay
performance-related fees for outperforming a benchmark.
But even if the degree of outperformance varies between measurement
services, why should the active managers have done far better on average
than the market as a whole?
Mr Clamp says that the small companies factor may be at work. Indexers,
unlike 1992's most successful fund managers, would have been required to
hold small companies 'and these were dogs last year,' Mr Clamp notes.
But could the underweighting in small companies spell trouble for 1993? In
the first two months of this year, the FT Small Capitalisation Index rose
12.1 per cent against a 2.4 per cent rise in the FT-A.
Also, the consultants say, several of the biggest fund managers had
particularly good stock selection. Gartmore, for instance, was said to have
switched heavily into recovery stocks immediately after the UK left the ERM.
Similarly, Phillips &amp;Drew, with an unusually low 48 per cent weighting in UK
equities, concentrated its holdings in the very large stocks which performed
best.
But if indices can vary so much, how is a pension fund client to decide
which should be the benchmark? Mr Clamp argues that the FT-A remains a valid
benchmark for indexed funds. However, perhaps it is time for performance
measurement services to devise sub-categories of their own that would allow
clients to compare performances more accurately.

FT  08 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Jobs data provide bonds with a dose of
cold reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS A 6.5 per cent yield on the 30-year Treasury bond a real possibility?
For most of last week, the mood of US bond dealers seemed to suggest that it
might be. It took the February employment data, which on Friday disclosed a
surprisingly large increase in jobs last month, to inject a dose of cold
reality into the market.
The persistent 'upbeat' mood - which, in the previous week, had sent the
long bond yield to its lowest level since 30-year bonds began to be issued
regularly in the 1970s - became plain when trading began on Monday.
In spite of disruption stemming from the World Trade Center blast and some
cautious comments on short-term government borrowing plans from Mr Lloyd
Bentsen, the new US treasury secretary, the long bond yield had fallen to
6.84 per cent by Monday evening from 6.9 per cent at the end of the previous
week.
Admittedly, there was nothing particularly alarmist in Mr Bentsen's remarks;
he simply indicated that there would be no 'dramatic, radical shift' in the
authorities' short-term borrowing plans.
Nevertheless, traders had attributed part of the long bond's price rise to
expectations that the quarterly 30-year auctions would diminish
significantly in scale, and this might have depressed sentiment. So, too,
might the temporary absence from the market of Cantor Fitzgerald, an
important brokerage firm in the bond market and one of the casualties of the
WTC explosion.
But, having overcome these obstacles, the bond price rally duly continued
for another three days. By Thursday evening, the long bond yield had dropped
to 6.78 per cent, and yields on other Treasury issues had also declined.
At this stage, there were few specific economic numbers to account for the
rise - although weaker-than-expected data on 10-day car sales may have
helped. In general, the rally appeared to result from growing confidence in
the non-inflationary implications of the Clinton economic plan, and even
some speculation about a further easing of interest rates by the
authorities.
Nevertheless, uneasiness about the speed and extent of the rally was
beginning to spread among analysts - and Friday's release of the jobs
numbers brought a perfect opportunity for the market to consolidate.
The numbers themselves were certainly unexpected: there was an increase of
365,000 workers on non-farm payrolls in February, about three times the
figure which pundits had been predicting, while the national unemployment
rate edged down by a tenth of 1 per cent, to 7 per cent.
With the weekend to reflect, analysts appeared to be striking a cautious
note.
Some pundits observed that manufacturing sector employment remains fairly
weak, although it does appear that the recent pick-up in economic activity
is finally translating into jobs.
Although demand and supply considerations may underpin recent bond yields,
many suspect that the steam will go out of the rally.
The coming week, meanwhile, will be fairly light on new economic data. The
February producer price index is due to be released on Friday, and
expectations centre on a small increase - perhaps 0.3 per cent, after 0.2
per cent in January - due to higher food and energy prices.
Predictions for February retail sales figures, out on Thursday, focus on a
modest 0.1 per cent increase. Individual store sales results for the month
have already displayed lacklustre trading, although retailers have blamed
severe winter weather in many parts of the country.

FT  08 MAR 93 / German Bonds: Prices soar on back of Bundesbank rate cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SURPRISE is a central weapon in the armoury of a central bank
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
especially the German Bundesbank, which over the course of last week teased
the markets with contradictory signals, but on Friday delivered a positive
surprise.
The market was disappointed that last Thursday's council meeting had closed
without a cut in either the Lombard or discount rates - and then delighted
when on Friday the Bundesbank announced a 24-basis point cut in its next
14-day repurchase agreement to 8.25 per cent, down from 8.49 per cent.
The move was taken by the markets as final confirmation that the Bundesbank
is embarked on a steady course of substantial cuts in short-term interest
rates - and proof that the Bundesbank believes the downturn in the German
economy will prove a better brake on inflation than high interest rates.
It sent German government bond prices up to their highest level since the
end of December 1988.
The average daily yield on all government securities dropped by 10 basis
points to 6.37 per cent, with the yield on 10-year benchmark bunds down to
6.5 per cent from 6.7 per cent at the beginning of the week and well below
the average over the last 10 years.
These price rises capped a glorious eight months for the German bund market.
Yields on 10-year bunds have dropped from 8.28 per cent in July last year,
buoyed by massive purchases by foreign investors.
There are no figures yet available for foreigners' purchases in the first
two months of the current year but over the whole of 1992 they spent DM135bn
buying German government securities, more than twice the DM60bn invested in
1991.
All but DM12.5bn of these purchases took place in the second half of the
year, reflecting investors' confidence in the strength of the D-Mark amid
the currency market turmoil. Foreign investors bought DM64bn of German bunds
in the last quarter alone.
Apart from the D-Mark's safe-haven status, investors were attracted by the
prospect of decisive cuts in interest rates which - after a rather grudging
start in mid-September with the half-point cut in the discount rate (to 8.25
per cent) and the quarter point off the Lombard (to 9.5 per cent) - gathered
momentum with the rate cuts on February 4, when the Bundesbank trimmed the
Lombard by 0.5 per cent and the discount rate to 8 per cent.
Comments from Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's policy-making
council, to the effect that the cut was not necessarily a prelude to further
reductions in the discount and Lombard rates the next time the council meets
on March 18, did nothing to stop excited speculation about the future course
of interest rates.
It is now widely expected that the 'official' Lombard and discount rates
will fall by up to two more full basis points during the course of the next
year.
Mr Kermit Schoenholtz at Salomon Brothers predicts that call money will drop
from its current level around the repo rate to 6.5 per cent by the end of
this year and below 5 per cent in 1994.
The question for investors is whether this scenario has already been
reflected in the significant price rises of recent months - whether now is
not the right time to sell bunds and buy the higher yielding fixed-income
securities of France, the UK, or even Italy, where yields on 10-year
benchmark bonds are respectively 81, 113 and 475 basis points higher than
the equivalent bund.
Mr Klaus Holschuh in Commerzbank's fixed-income research department believes
that there is significant downside risk associated with holding 10-year
bunds.
He says that once foreign investors start to take their profits in any
volume - perhaps after the Bundesbank does cut its official rates again -
selling pressure could put yields on such long maturities back up to 7.3 to
7.5 per cent. These bunds are likely to be most vulnerable to worries about
Germany's poor fundamentals on the inflation and budget deficit front.
Mr Holschuh argues that bunds with intermediate maturities make a better
investment for those investors not prepared to risk moving put of D-Mark
assets at present.
Yields on bunds with three, four and five-year maturities are around 6.2 per
cent and could gain most as the shape of the still inverted yield curve
normalises amid further interest rate easing.
The danger of this strategy is that yields on 10-year bunds could after all
climb still further, teased upwards by the Bundesbank's gradualist approach
to rate cuts and the severity of the German recession.

FT  08 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: Domestic buyers wary ahead of Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a further reduction in yields for long-dated gilts, bond specialists
are starting to ask how long the good times will last.
The indications are that during February - a bumper month for gilt prices -
steady demand from overseas institutions, particularly in the US and
Germany, have been a big stimulant for the market.
But domestic investors are likely to be wary about any big gilt purchases
before next week's Budget.
They will also be looking for any surprise weakness in the monthly figures
for producer price inflation due out tomorrow.
General sentiment in the gilt market was boosted by expectations about an
imminent cut in key German interest rates coupled with stronger sterling and
a favourable UK inflation outlook.
A surprise 24 basis-point cut in Germany's 14-day repurchase rate announced
on Friday added weight to views that the Bundesbank's decision-making
council will reduce its discount and Lombard interest rates at its next
meeting on March 18.
The June gilt future, which broke through 107 on Friday, is thought likely
to continue its recent rise.
At Friday's close, 15-year gilt yields were down about 25 basis points on
the week to around 7.8 per cent in a continuation of the marked reduction in
yields since late January.
According to many specialists, gilt gains are likely to lag slightly behind
the German and French markets, with the yield spread between 10-year gilts
and bunds widening by just a few basis points over the next week or two.
Mr John Shepperd, an economist at SG Warburg Securities, says that the
Treasury is likely to end the 1992-1993 financial year overfunded to the
tune of about Pounds 4bn, due partly to a higher-than-expected surplus on
the fiscal account in January.
However, much attention will focus on the public sector borrowing
requirement for February, due to be announced on Budget day, which some
believe could be extremely high.
Worries about the PSBR in 1993-1994 - thought likely to be at least Pounds
50bn, as opposed to the likely figure of roughly Pounds 35bn to Pounds 37bn
for 1992-1993 - are likely to be a prominent feature of market operations
over the next two months.
During this period gilt yields at the long end could easily rise on account
of fears that a large level of funding will pull down prices.
Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at the London office of the Japanese bank
Yamaichi, is among the relative pessimists who think yields may not have
much further to fall at the long end.
'I am concerned about the level of yields at this end of the curve,' Mr
Richardson said. 'In the past three weeks there has been nothing to dent the
market's view that inflation in the UK is under control. But further out we
could see inflationary pressures starting to build up. The level of funding
envisaged for 1993-1994 will not be a problem - as long as all the other
factors are under control, of which inflation is one.'
Many analysts believe that on Budget day, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
will announce a new programme of gilt auctions which will ram home the
implications of the large volume of funding around the corner.
It could be that after this the appreciable rally in the gilt market, which
was a prominent feature of 1992, will start to peter out.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Australia's Orbital reports firm
orders for new type of car engine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Orbital Engine Company has told the New York and Australian
stock exchanges that it has won orders from 'a major automotive producer'
for its innovative two-stroke engines.
Ford, General Motors, Fiat and Volkswagen are among car makers already
holding licences from Orbital to develop the technology. Orbital engines are
around half the weight and two-thirds the size of conventional car engines.
However, Ford, which has several dozen prototype Orbital-powered Fiestas in
trial use with fleet operators in the UK - and is widely regarded as the
front-runner for bringing Orbital cars to market - rejected speculation that
it was involved in the announced agreement.
Orbital, in which Broken Hill Proprietary has a 25 per cent stake, said it
was prevented by a confidentiality agreement from naming the manufacturer
which had signed the letter of intent.
According to Orbital, the agreement provides for the vehicle maker initially
to take supplies of OCP (Orbital Combustion Process) engines from a US plant
being prepared by Orbital at a former GM facility in Tecumseh, Michigan, and
which is due to come on stream at the end of this year.
This will be complemented by an engineering programme at Orbital's research
and development facilities at Perth, Western Australia.
The rationale behind the Tecumseh plant is for it to provide licensees with
only a sufficient volume of engines for them to gain know-how before
committing to their own high-volume manufacture.
Ford hopes to have small, Orbital-engined cars in its range by as early as
1995. The engines are said to be 10 per cent more powerful and 12 per cent
more economical than conventional rivals.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: A dividend dilemma at Banesto -
Disposal could allow the bank to make a full payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARIO Conde, chairman of Banesto, Spain's third largest bank, has one of
those problems this week that occasionally make it fun to be in debt.
On Friday, Banesto announced it had sold its biggest banking subsidiary,
Banco de Madrid, to Deutsche Bank for Pta42bn (Dollars 357m). This deal will
allow the German bank, which already owns Catalonia-based Bancotrans, to
become the largest foreign bank in Spain. But it was far more important for
Mr Conde.
Banesto will make a profit of Pta30bn from the disposal and now has to
decide what to do with it. It has two choices.
The first and most probable use of the money will be to provide for bad
debts. Non-recoverable loans are at record levels in Spain, but are
particularly burdensome at Banesto where assets grew rapidly just prior to
the downturn in the economy last year.
The Bank of Spain had given Banesto until the end of next year to find an
extra Pta40bn to cover itself.
The other, more remote, possibility, is that the money will be used to help
pay a full dividend for 1992. As things stand now, Banesto cannot possibly
match the full 1991 payout of Pta205, because the parent bank's profits fell
last year and the Bank of Spain would frown on any bank, perhaps especially
Banesto, reducing the amount of net profit transferred to reserves in the
middle of a recession.
Banesto has already paid Pta95 to shareholders for 1991, though, and has
until June to decide whether, and how, to make its traditional complimentary
payment. Analysts disagree about what might be done and the bank is keeping
silent. But there is some hope for shareholders.
The waters are further muddied by the fact that Banesto is planning a large
three-for-one rights issue, which has won a promise of support from JP
Morgan and which Banesto hopes will raise up to Pta53bn in new capital.
There is an outside chance that a successful rights issue might persuade the
Bank of Spain to allow Mr Conde to use all or most of last year's Pta20.2bn
parent bank net profit to pay shareholders. The rights-issue proceeds would
then go to reserves where, normally, most of the 1992 profit would expect to
end up.
Clearly the central bank would be persuaded one way or the other by the
final outcome of the rights issue.
In truth, though, the rights issue would be paying the dividend, thus
putting Mr Conde in the curious position of asking shareholders for money in
order to be able to give it back to them.
Between making the full possible payment, with Bank of Spain complicity, and
making none at all lies an acceptable policy. It is this that Mr Conde - and
his prospective new shareholder in JP Morgan - will be searching for.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kirch raises holding in Springer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LEO Kirch, the media magnate, has paid DM220m (Dollars 132m) to increase
to 29 per cent his shareholding in Axel Springer, the large German
publishing group which counts Bild and Die Welt among its newspaper titles.
He has acquired the 10 per cent stake in Springer sold last week by
Poligrafici Editoriale, the Italian publishing company.
Before the purchase, Mr Kirch already had around 25 per cent of the Springer
voting rights.
The deal stems from a cross-shareholding agreement between Springer and
Poligrafici under which both companies have ended their involvement with
each other.
Springer has sold its 10 per cent stake, or 13.2m shares, in Poligrafici to
the Monti Group, the Italian publisher which holds the majority stake in
Poligrafici. The selling cost is reported to be L4,650 (Dollars 2.95) a
share.
Springer's decision to sell its stake ends its short involvement in the
Italian media market. But it also means that the group, which publishes
Bild, the mass circulation daily, and Die Welt, a more serious daily, is
likely to spend more time improving sales, distribution and circulation in
eastern Germany.
German newspapers are attempting to increase their share of the expanding
eastern German market. In particular, two new weeklies, Focus and Die Woche,
are aiming for a younger, up-market readership.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: American Express plans to reduce
stake in First Data

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Express, the US financial services group that has recently
undergone significant management upheavals, is planning to sell more than
half its majority stake in First Data Corporation.
The disposal could bring some Dollars 1.2bn into American Express, which
suffered a painful profits setback last year. First Data administers credit
card transactions for companies such as Visa and Mastercard, as well as
American Express itself.
American Express said that it planned to sell 32m shares in First Data, with
a further 3.2m becoming available if the offer went well.
The sale could reduce American Express's stake in First Data from 54 per
cent to around 22 per cent.
First Data shares eased Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 34.50 on the news, which
came on Friday afternoon. At this sort of level, however, the disposal would
raise around Dollars 1.2bn for the financial services group, ahead of sale
expenses.
American Express said that the proceeds of the sale would be used for
'general corporate purposes'.
The sale itself did not surprise Wall Street, although it is the first
important move made by the company since Mr Harvey Golub replaced Mr James
Robinson as chief executive of American Express earlier this year.
American Express sold more than 50m shares in First Data last year, raising
more than Dollars 1bn in the process and cutting its interest to the 54 per
cent ownership level.
American Express shares gained Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 25 5/8 on Friday's
news.
Net earnings at American Express more than halved for 1992 following a steep
decline in profits within the group's travel side and a slide into losses at
Shearson Lehman, American Express' brokerage and investment banking
operations.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ministry denies role in OCP
counter-bid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE French industry ministry has denied involvement in an attempt to mount a
counter-bid for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines
wholesaler, which is facing a takeover offer from a German group.
A senior official said the ministry had responded to requests for
information from shareholders of Gehe, the German group that last month made
a friendly FFr1.8bn (Dollars 318.6m) offer for OCP.
The French government had no interest in meddling in purely private
business, the official said. 'We do not get involved in takeovers,' he
added. The only industry ministry involvement was to provide information
about French medicine marketing rules to Gehe shareholders, the official
explained. 'I can assure you that Franco-German business relations are very
good,' he said.
The ministry's denial contradicts claims earlier this week by some
representatives of OCP and a member of a French consortium of
pharmaceuticals companies that the government was sponsoring a French
counter-bid.
However, a leading French drugs group in the consortium yesterday
reconfirmed that the industry ministry had advised it on mounting a possible
counter-bid for OCP.
Mr Jean-Pierre Duche, OCP's chief executive, supports the German deal, but
OCP's largest single shareholder, the Bourely family, with 15 per cent of
the equity, opposes it. A legal action between rival existing shareholders
for control of OCP is understood to be under way.
Meanwhile, the French Treasury has delayed for 10 days its decision on
whether to give the German bid the go-ahead.
OCP says that officials want to examine the ownership structure of Gehe and
in particular Franz Haniel, the Duisburg-based trading and service company
which owns Gehe.

DUMEZ, one of France's largest construction companies, plans to cut 1,500
jobs in France this year after suffering a steep fall in sales in 1992.
Mr Jean-Louis Brault, who 18 months ago became chairman of Dumez, a
subsidiary of the Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez utility group, announced that his
company had seen sales fall by 25 per cent to FFr15bn (Dollars 2.65bn) in
1992 from FFr20bn in 1991.
Dumez, like other construction companies, has been badly affected by the
slowdown across the European construction sector. It has also encountered
problems with contracts in Saudi Arabia.
Mr Brault said Dumez envisaged reducing its 8,333-strong French workforce by
18 per cent, with 500 job losses at the parent company and 1,000 at the
regional subsidiaries this year.
News of the Dumez rationalisation follows the announcement earlier this year
that Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez faced a sharp fall in net profits of over 65
per cent last year.

HONGKONG Electric, which operates the electric power monopoly on Hong Kong
island, has exceeded expectations by reporting a 30 per cent rise in 1992
earnings to HKDollars 3.05bn (USDollars 394m) from HKDollars 2.3bn in 1991.
Profit was struck on a 9.3 per cent rise in turnover to HKDollars 5.3bn,
from HKDollars 4.8bn. The directors declared a final dividend of 52 cents a
share, making 82 cents for the year - a rise of 17 per cent on 1991.
Mr Simon Murray, chairman, said Secan, the group's property development
associate, contributed more than 20 per cent of pre-tax profits. Analysts
expect the company's land bank to be fully utilised by the end of 1994.
Mr Murray said the electric company recorded a profit growth of 14 per cent
during the year. Unit sales of electricity rose by 4 per cent - well below
the overall growth rate of Hong Kong's economy of 5 per cent in real terms.
During the year the company invested HKDollars 2.97bn in new electricity and
power facilities.

HAGEMEYER, the Dutch-based trading company that is 65 per cent-owned by
First Pacific of Hong Kong, yesterday reported a 21 per cent jump in 1992
net profit to Fl 103.1m (Dollars 55.7m) and a 5.6 per cent rise in its
dividend to Fl 6.00.
The company also announced plans for a two-for-one share split and an
increase in authorised share capital to Fl 470m from Fl 290m. It added that
it had no immediate plans for a share issue.
Hagemeyer, which focuses on selling and distributing brand-name consumer and
professional products, attributed the strong gain to its wholesale
electro-technical subsidiaries and to its North American consumer electronic
activities. Sales and profits from consumer and professional electronics
were unchanged from 1991.
Overall, turnover rose by 15.3 per cent to Fl 3.4bn and would have shown a
18.5 per cent increase but for exchange rate movements.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rothmans forms Pounds 55m joint
venture in Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROTHMANS International is to invest Pounds 55m in a cigarette manufacturing
joint venture with Nevo Tobacco, a privately-owned tobacco company in St
Petersburg, Russia.
The deal marks Rothmans' first capital investment in central and eastern
Europe, though it has licensing arrangements in Poland and the former
Yugoslavia.
Rothmans will acquire a 75 per cent shareholding in the venture, to be
called Rothmans Nevo, and will build a new cigarette factory in St
Petersburg.
The factory, with an output of 10bn cigarettes a year, is expected to begin
production in mid-1995.
The UK-based company's Pounds 55m investment will be phased over several
years and will cover construction costs and the supply of plant and
equipment.
Lord Swaythling, Rothmans' chairman, said: 'This venture is a major
long-term initiative with a view to capitalising on the opportunity that
Russia represents as one of the largest potential consumer markets in the
world'.
Russia, with a market estimated at 443bn cigarettes a year, has already
attracted large-scale investment from other tobacco multinationals.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Reduced interest charge behind
rise at British Data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Data Management, the data storage specialist which came to the
market through a placing a year ago, reported doubled pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.66m for the six months ended December 31, against Pounds 779,000
last time.
Sales rose 13 per cent from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 7.04m. The pre-tax figure
was struck after a much reduced interest charge - down from Pounds 687,000
to Pounds 53,000.
Earnings per share rose 25 per cent to 6.5p and the group declared an
interim dividend of 1.5p. The directors said the earnings figure was
flattered by a Pounds 138,000 tax charge that was significantly lower due to
Pounds 258,000 of over-provisioning in the previous year.
Mr Stephen Crown, British Data's chairman, said a strict comparison of
earnings could not be made because in the previous year BDM paid no tax
because of losses brought forward.
He said he continued to seek substantial organic growth that would be
supplemented by bolt-on acquisitions.
The company expected to gain a significant amount of new work from the
government which, through its market testing programme, is seeking to farm
out support functions.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Called to account for past
practices - Andrew Buxton of Barclays Bank faces a most testing time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEXT two weeks will probably be the most testing of Mr Andrew Buxton's
career. After becoming chairman and chief executive of Barclays Bank in
January, just in time to announce the first pre-tax loss in the bank's 96
year history, he faces a wave of doubt over whether he should stay in either
job. His future will depend on meetings with shareholders around the country
which start this week.
Mr Buxton yesterday indicated the outline of the arguments he intends to
put. That he accepts some blame for the past when he was managing director
under Sir John Quinton in the late 1980s. That under his leadership the bank
has improved its operating performance, and will continue to do so. And that
he will hand over a significant part his responsibilities to a new senior
executive this year.
None of this is likely to come as a surprise to the bank's large
shareholders. But they will be watching Mr Buxton's performance closely to
see if he can alter their perception that he has not presented his own and
the bank's case well so far. Some institutions believe his performance at
last week's post-results press and analysts' conferences should have been
more confident.
The degree of dissatisfaction among shareholders is open to debate. Fund
managers holding 15 per cent of the bank's shares contacted by the Financial
Times on Friday expressed varying degrees of discontent, the strongest being
the view that Mr Buxton should resign. But Barclays believes it has received
support from the most senior executives of the institutions concerned.
Yet the bank tacitly accepts the view that it cannot judge entirely on the
basis of telephone calls made by Mr Buxton on Friday. The ultimate test will
come in the post results 'roadshow' in which Mr Buxton makes plain he will
play a full part. 'I have got to try to reassure them, and make sure they
appreciate that the current management is getting decisions right,' he said
yesterday.
Mr Buxton's problem in doing so is his link with the past. This is partly as
a member of one of the Quaker families in charge of the regional banks which
came together to make up Barclays. But it is substantially to do with a more
recent period of history: the time in May 1988 when he became managing
director, just after a rights issue of Pounds 921m to expand lending had
been announced.
Mr Buxton made an incautious remark at the press conference on Thursday
indicating that he had little direct responsibility for this lending growth.
Yesterday, he was carefully emphasising that he bore some responsibility,
and should have performed better. 'With hindsight, when I became managing
director, I wish I had jumped on the problem of expansion earlier,' he said.
His defence is that despite having made mistakes, he essentially arrived too
late to stop lending mushrooming. He argues that much of the problem lending
in the following two years came from large companies taking up more of what
were already-agreed facilities. 'When you come in the middle of a fast
expansion programme that is already taking place, it is difficult to
control,' he says.
This issue alone would provide enough material for debate. But Mr Buxton
faces questions on a second point: when and how he will take steps to split
his two roles.
He remained cautious about details yesterday, but promised it would happen
this year. 'I do not think later would be acceptable to shareholders, and I
do not want an uncertainty of this sort any longer than necessary,' he said.
There are two uncertainties involved. The first is whether the bank will
actually appoint a chief executive in both name and deed, or have a chief
opera-ting officer similar to Mr Buxton's old post of managing director.
Any wavering is likely to stimulate discontent among shareholders, one
reason for Mr Buxton's promise yesterday of handing over 'a significant
part' of his job.
The second uncertainty is whether the new senior executive will come from
inside or outside the bank. As long as Mr Buxton remains chairman, investors
are likely to place significance on the new senior executive coming from
outside the bank. Yet this could present internal problems by risking
curtailing the responsibilities of executives such as Sir Peter Middleton,
the deputy chairman.
Mr Buxton emphasised yesterday that this potential problem was one reason
why he was taking some time to decide how the new management structure -
first introduced in 1991 - should be reformed. 'It is a definite
consideration. I must take the management team with me and ensure that I
hold them together, and convince them that any new structure is going to
work,' he said firmly.
Barclays' chairman emphasised yesterday that he did not believe investors'
concern was so great that they 'want to fire the whole of the management
team'. But he would not be drawn on the question of what he would do if the
shareholder meetings over the next two weeks convinced him otherwise. 'As
the saying goes, I would prefer not to start from there,' said Mr Buxton.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Time Products in Dollars 17m
luxury handbags buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME PRODUCTS, the UK watch and jewellery distributor, has paid Dollars 17m
(Pounds 11.9m) for the business of Judith Leiber, an American who designs
luxury handbags for the international jet-set.
Hollywood stars are among customers prepared to pay several thousand dollars
for a handbag made by Mrs Leiber, 72, who started her business 30 years ago
in New York.
A designer bag presented to Mrs Barbara Bush was valued at Dollars 1,245. It
showed a likeness of Millie, the presidential couple's pet dog.
Mrs Leiber will continue to run her company, which distributes only through
exclusive department stores and jewellers. Time Products has distributed her
handbags in the UK since 1991.
The UK company said the handbags had not been actively marketed outside
North America, and there was therefore potential for developing the brand
worldwide. There was scope for applying the name to merchandise other than
handbags, putting a broader range of products through the same
tightly-targeted distribution network.
Time Products also announced that it had paid Pounds 2m for a 5 per cent
stake in Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker which specialises in highly
technical and luxurious timepieces.
Mr Marcus Marguiles, chairman of Time Products, said: 'Judith Leiber is one
of the most highly-prized brands in North America and we are delighted to
have secured it, while our relationship with Audemars Piguet will be
strengthened by our investment.'
The Leiber business made pre-tax profits of Dollars 1m, after directors'
remunerations, on sales of Dollars 15m in the year to December 31. It had
net assets at that date of Dollars 5.1m.
Even after completing these acquisitions, Time Products has net cash of more
than Pounds 10m.

FT  08 MAR 93 / International Company News: Etonbrook meeting called
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Andrew Perloff, the rebel shareholder in Etonbrook, has requisitioned an
extraordinary general meeting of the property development company, in
another attempt to join the board and remove all of its existing directors.
Mr Perloff and the three companies acting with him own 20 per cent of
Etonbrook. He has twice failed to win a seat on the board but thwarted a
proposed capital restructuring at an EGM in September.
In January the former BES company blamed a drop in its interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 74,000 on costs incurred in fighting a
tender offer from Mr Berloff, which would have increased his stake to just
under 30 per cent.

Jaguar Cars has signed an agreement extending for 10 years a contract under
which Unipart, the motor components manufacturer and distributor, manages
Jaguar's worldwide parts operations.
The contract is expected to be worth more than Pounds 500m over its 10-year
life.
At the beginning of last year Unipart took over worldwide parts distribution
for Rover Group's Land Rover and Range Rover vehicles, adding Pounds 100m a
year to its turnover.
The Land Rover business was a significant contributor to Unipart's record
Pounds 19.8m profits in 1992 - a 28.5 per cent rise. It has controlled
Rover's car parts distribution ever since privatisation.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Revenues from MTV Europe at Dollars 60m a year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTV Europe, the London- based satellite rock music channel, is now producing
revenues at the rate of Dollars 60m-Dollars 70m a year, according to Mr
Frank Biondi, president and chief executive of Viacom, which owns MTV
Europe.
Until now MTV has declined to give any financial numbers for its European
television network which is available in 43m homes in 32 countries.
'MTV Europe's revenues have been increasing at 70 to 80 per cent a year
although it will be tough to keep that up', Mr Biondi said. The revenue
figures are at least double that suspected by analysts.
'We (MTV Europe) will be available in 50m homes by the end of this calendar
year,' Mr Biondi forecast. He stuck to a previous formula to describe MTV
Europe's profits. 'It is marginally profitable.' In fact all the signs are
that the company is being conservative in its public statements and after 5
1/2 years on air MTV Europe is comfortable profitable.
Viacom recently announced that it was bringing its American children's
channel Nickelodeon to the UK in a joint venture with British Sky
Broadcasting. Mr Biondi said the aim was to take Nickelodeon to other
European countries through joint ventures with local partners.
MTV, which worldwide is available in more than 200m homes, plans to launch a
service for Latin America in October. The 24-hour channel will be for
Spanish speakers in the US and central and south America.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Thomas Cook considers offer for Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS Cook, the travel agency and financial services group, was last night
considering the final details of a tender offer for shares in Owners Abroad,
the tour company fighting a hostile bid from rival Airtours.
Representatives of Owners Abroad were meeting Thomas Cook and its advisers
to decide pricing and size of tender, accord- ing to sources close to the
companies.
Any cash tender could put a substantial obstacle in the way of Airtours' all
share and partial cash alternative offers as the bid enters its last full
week.
A tender offer, which could be as early as today or tomorrow and would have
to be made this week, is likely to be made dependent on shareholders
rejecting Airtours offer. At Friday night's close, the bid values Owners
Abroad at Pounds 290m, or 144p per share, through the paper offer.
The tender offer would need the approval of Westdeutsche Landesbank, the
German state bank that controls Thomas Cook, and LTU, the German travel
agency.
Thomas Cook has repeatedly reaffirmed its belief in the commercial tie-up
with Owners Abroad announced last year.
Once Airtours had launched its bid, Owners shareholders were almost
unanimous in describing as inadequate the equity swap which underpinned the
commercial transaction with Thomas Cook.
If Thomas Cook does make a tender offer, Owners Abroad's largest
shareholder, Mercury Asset Management, may take centre stage. Last week MAM
increased its stake in Owners Abroad to 14.07 per cent, from 13.4 per cent,
but gave no indication whether it would accept or reject the offers.
Reacting to the possibility of a tender offer, Mr David Crossland, Airtours
chairman, said Thomas Cook should bid for all the stock.
'LTU and Thomas Cook have tried to get into Owners Abroad on the cheap once
before,' he said. 'Shareholders will recognise this for what it is  - a
wrecking move supported by a desperate board.'
In judging where, or whether, to pitch a tender offer, Thomas Cook would
have to consider that if the offer were too high, allocation of shares would
be scaled down.
They would also be aware that some institutions are unlikely to be happy
being left with shares that no longer attracted a bid premium.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Glaxo accused over Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO, Europe's biggest drugs group, has been accused by the US Food and
Drug Administration of making false and misleading statements about Zantac,
the world's best-selling medicine with annual sales of about Pounds 2bn
The FDA says the company 'frequently suggests unapproved uses for Zantac and
consistently makes comparative efficacy and safety claims that are not
supported by adequate data'. It has asked Glaxo to write to all US doctors
correcting the statements.
The agency says Glaxo made misleading statements about the safety of Zantac,
an ulcer treatment, compared with other drugs in its class, notably
SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet and Merck's Pepcid. It also says Glaxo made
unsubstantiated claims about the drug's effectiveness. The drug represents
45 per cent of Glaxo's turnover. Analysts believe annual US sales are about
Dollars 1.4bn.
Last month, Glaxo Inc, the UK group's American arm, said it disagreed with
most of the FDA's claims. Dr Ernest Mario, the UK company's chief executive,
said he would be very surprised if the company had to send out a letter to
US practitioners.
At that time, Dr Mario said he believed the move had been instigated by
Glaxo's competitors. Zantac's sales during the six months to December 31
increased 14 per cent to Pounds 1.03bn.
However, Glaxo Inc yesterday said it had met the FDA and was co-operating
with the agency in the hope of settling the issue soon. Meanwhile it has
complied with a request for the company to stop all aspects of its
advertising and promotional activities that contain the contested claims.
The company refused to confirm whether it would send the doctors' letter.
Glaxo denied there was any serious risk of Zantac being withdrawn from the
US. It said: 'We do not believe there is anything in this situation that
cannot be settled in our discussions with the FDA and will keep this product
from being available to US patients. The safety and effectiveness of Zantac
have not been called into question.'
It is not unusual for the FDA to oblige drugs companies to send letters to
practitioners. Last week, Marion Merrell Dow, the US group, sent a letter
about its anti-ulcer treatment Carafate.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Changes in store as CSFB aims to stay in front: Management
moves at the investment bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEHIND the assurances of continuity, changes are afoot at Credit Suisse
First Boston, following the announcement last week that Mr David Mulford,
the former US Treasury official and erstwhile investment banker, is to
replace Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff as head of the London-based investment bank.
CSFB is one of the institutions most closely associated with the growth of
international financial markets in London in the 1980s, and Mr Rudloff, a
highly visible figure in those markets, has been almost synonymous with
CSFB.
The nature of Mr Rudloff's departure has provoked speculation about what
lies in store for the bank he shaped. Mr Rudloff, whose appointment emerged
at a board meeting in Zurich on Wednesday, hinted enigmatically: 'You can
never pre-judge a board in Switzerland.'
In a recent interview in the magazine Euromoney, Mr Rudloff, asked if
another career awaited him, replied: 'Perhaps. But there is still so much to
build here.'
He is to join the board of CS Holding, the majority shareholder of the CS
First Boston group, which includes CSFB and its two sister companies. CS
Holding reported net earnings of SFr534m (Pounds 244m) in the first half to
September 1992.
'This is a transition that was planned - though the timing was not planned,'
said Mr Mulford adding that it was Mr Rudloff himself who had precipitated
the timing of the change.
Mr Mulford had arrived in London only the day before the announcement, from
an assignment in Latin America, and admitted to not being fully briefed yet
on the operations of the firm he had just taken over, but his early comments
will do nothing to dispel the impression that changes lie ahead.
The old rivalries remain between the three arms of the group, First Boston
in the US, CSFB in Europe and CS First Boston Pacific in Asia, despite a
move to bring them all together in 1988 under a common holding company, CS
First Boston.
'The period of separateness is clearly over, but it does take time for the
culture to change,' says Mulford. He believes he will 'provide leadership in
accelerating the global integration of investment banking (at CSFB), which
still has some way to go'.
There is also a desire to develop CSFB beyond its base as a Euromarkets
firm. Mr Mulford refers to a shift from CSFB's core fixed-income
underwriting business as a process already underway. He says he 'wants to
maintain the leadership position' of CSFB in the traditional fixed income
business, but 'there is also growing global investment banking business,
which is more diverse. This firm has to broaden the scope of its investment
banking business'.
This view is shaped by his belief that, during his years away from the
industry, the process of 'globalisation' has transformed financial markets,
as borders between markets were removed. Mr Mulford has a mandate to develop
business in Latin America, where his contacts are excellent (he was the US
Treasury's negotiator on the Brady plan). He also has a keen interest in
eastern Europe (where CSFB has been one of very few active banks) and the
former Soviet Union. He says he joined CS First Boston because he believed
it to be the most international of banking groups.
'That (global) business is marketed and managed differently from a
traditional Euromarket fixed income business. It is . . . much more complex
.'
Some observers see the appointment as a victory for the US arm of the
business: Mr Mulford was brought in last November as vice-chairman of First
Boston in the US. A more integrated firm, they think, will effectively be
governed from the US, where the holding company for the three units is
based.
'CSFB used to be a very independent, locally-focused firm,' said one former
employee. 'That is going to change.'
The appointment follows a bad year for CSFB in 1992, when profits slumped,
and the US arm of the firm was the main contributor to the group, reversing
the trend of the last few years.
Management changes elsewhere in the CS First Boston group last week add to
the impression that disparate businesses are being pulled closer together.
Mr Bob Diamond, who had been in charge of the Asian unit, was moved to New
York to run bond trading in the US and Asia.
This move towards specialisation - which most other US-based investment
banks have already made - raises a question over the position of Mr Allen
Wheat, who runs the firm's derivatives unit and only last year was made head
of trading in London. He had been widely tipped to succeed Mr Rudloff. Last
week's announcement left it unclear if he would now report to Mr Diamond.
Mr Mulford said: 'Allen is a very, very important figure, both here and in
the group.' But the appointment of Mr Mulford, passing over Mr Wheat, casts
doubt over the stability of the firm's senior management.
'Basically, CSFB has been split in two,' says one insider, meaning that the
investment banking side will operate under Mr Mulford, while Mr Wheat will
run trading operations in London.
The appointment of Mr Mulford is undoubtedly the greatest upheaval since the
restructuring of the group under a new holding company in 1988.
'I haven't come here to change things,' protests Mr Mulford. But change
seems to be on the way, nevertheless.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Economics Notebook: A question mark over the UK's future
prosperity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH UK economic recovery apparently on the horizon, the big question now is
whether Britain has capacity to exploit the opportunities ahead.
Past experience and common sense suggest that a recession stretching over
two and a half years will have destroyed a great deal of productive
capacity, especially in manufacturing industry.
That was certainly the case in the recession of 1979-81 when huge steel and
engineering plants were shut, demolished, and eventually replaced by
out-of-town shopping malls such as Merry Hill in the West Midlands and
Meadowhall near Sheffield. The widespread fear is that the same process has
been under way since 1990 and that this will limit the scope for recovery.
But how valid are such concerns? A general impression, garnered from
anecdotal evidence, is that this recession has not been accompanied by a
massive scrapping of manufacturing capacity.
Another encouraging sign is the strength of profit margins. In its recent
quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reported that profit margins
from non-North Sea activities have fallen far less in this recession than in
those of the early 1980s or the mid-1970s.
However, it is very difficult to estimate how much capacity has been lost or
to measure the gap that has emerged between actual and potential output in
the economy as a whole. Although this 'output gap' is vitally important for
assessing the nation's capacity to grow out of the recession without running
into inflationary bottlenecks, statistical deficiencies mean that nobody has
a clear idea of its size. The Bank of England's inflation report included
estimates that the gap could be around 7 per cent or 3 per cent, but the
Bank made no judgment as to which was nearer the truth.
In the case of manufacturing, however, economists at Kleinwort Benson, the
UK investment bank, suggest industry has come through the recession in
'surprisingly good shape' and the destruction of capacity has been far less
than between 1979 and 1981.
Two Kleinwort economists, Mr Peter Spencer and Mr Leo Doyle, have looked at
Central Statistical Office estimates of manufacturing industry's capital
stock and evidence on below-capacity working from the quarterly
Confederation of British Industry industrial trends surveys. They conclude
that the recession has not yet seriously reduced industry's productive
capacity.
Their view is broadly endorsed by Mr Andrew Sentance, the CBI's director of
economics and one of the seven-man panel of independent forecasters set up
by the Treasury to advise Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor. According to Mr
Sentance, manufacturing capacity has declined slightly from its peak in 1990
but is about a fifth higher than at its post-recession trough in 1982.
However, Mr Sentance points out such growth hardly constitutes good news.
Business investment grew too slowly in the 1980s because an excessive
portion of resources went to consumption. 'In the 1980s, the UK devoted a
larger share of gross domestic product to public consumption than any other
Group of Seven country and the proportion devoted to private consumption was
the second highest after the United States,' he says.
The UK's lagging investment performance has also been a matter of concern
for Professor Douglas McWilliams, a former CBI economic adviser and chief
executive of the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), an
economic consultancy. He says that UK manufacturing capacity has grown by
only 20.5 per cent since 1970. Although it grew at an annual rate of 3.5 per
cent from 1984 to 1991, this relatively strong growth failed to offset the
deterioration relative to other countries that had taken place earlier.
While UK manufacturing capacity grew by 19 per cent between 1970 and 1990,
it increased by a total 43 per cent in Germany, France and Italy combined,
by 86 per cent the US, and by 129 per cent in Japan. Between 1980 to 1990,
the picture was slightly more encouraging. UK manufacturing capacity grew by
7 per cent compared with just 1 per cent in the continental 'big three'
countries, but lagged the US and Japan where capacity grew by 32 per cent
and 39 per cent respectively.
So much for the bad news. Official figures suggest that UK investment is now
picking up after a sharp fall of 9.4 per cent between 1990 and 1991 and a
3.5 per cent decline between 1991 and 1992. Capital spending by
manufacturers on buildings, vehicles and machinery rose by a real,
inflation-adjusted 3.1 per cent in the final six months of 1992 compared
with the first half of that year and has now risen for three quarters in
succession.
Such an upward trend in investment is unprecedented in a recession and when
CBI surveys say that about 70 per cent of companies are working below
capacity. It should add to confidence about Britain's capacity for recovery.
But the investment upturn may also reflect special factors. A CEBR study
published last week showed that nearly one-fifth of the Pounds 220bn
invested in British industry since 1987 had come from abroad. Some of this
flow may start to tail off, particularly if the Japanese car industry has to
address problems at home.
The accelerating pace of technological change may also explain why
investment now appears to be leading rather than lagging the business cycle.
Mr David Owen, another of Kleinwort's economics team, suggests that spending
on information technology may be behind the investment surge. A similar
pattern of strongly rising investment in weak economic conditions was
visible in the US in 1991 and 1992, reflecting the need of companies there
to restructure and shrink and acquire the latest technology to compete
successfully.
Spending on rationalisation may not add significantly to growth. Indeed, the
UK may simply be replacing the wrong sort of capacity with more efficient
and up-to-date equipment.
While such investment is clearly better than none at all, the danger is that
Britain will still be left with a small and efficient manufacturing sector
that is too small for the nation's future prosperity.

FT  08 MAR 93 / British supercomputer sale to US laboratory sparks row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TOP California weapons laboratory has sparked controversy in the US by
deciding to purchase a supercomputer from the American subsidiary of Meiko
Scientific, a little-known British-owned company.
The US Energy Department's Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, in Berkeley, near
San Francisco, has agreed to buy a Dollars 15m (Pounds 10.5m) supercomputer
from Meiko, choosing the British-owned company's product over those of
several US competitors.
Supercomputers are used widely in weapons research, geological exploration
and meteorology. Meiko is believed to be the only non US-owned company to
sell a supercomputer to a US government laboratory for 30 years.
The decision comes only two weeks after President Bill Clinton unveiled a
technology policy which includes plans to boost the competitiveness of US
companies by encouraging greater collaboration between industry and the
national laboratories.
Meiko, founded in 1985 by six computer engineers from Inmos, the innovative
UK state-backed silicon chip manufacturer, has sales of about Dollars 20m a
year.
US supercomputer manufacturers have regarded Japanese companies as their
chief competitors, and the Meiko deal has shocked industry executives who
are likely to protest against the sale.
US companies dominate the European supercomputer market, but the sale may
raise concerns about supercomputer export controls. While the US and Japan
have agreed to limit sales of supercomputers to foreign governments because
the computers can be used in the development of nuclear weapons, Europe has
not so far agreed to such limits.
Already, Meiko's export record has been brought into question, especially a
sale to Israel in 1991 which would have been forbidden to US companies.
'These are American tax dollars that shouldn't be spent in lowering our
national security by pumping up a company that has a bad export record,' Mr
Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control in
Washington, and an authority on nuclear proliferation, is quoted as saying
in the New York Times. Mr David Alden, president of Meiko Scientific, denied
his company has a 'bad export record'.

FT  08 MAR 93 / BT plans for US services face tough market access talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH TELECOM is planning this week to apply to the US regulatory
authorities for permission to operate domestic and international telephone
services in the US.
If approval is given, it will clear the way for BT to become the first
international telecommunications 'one-stop shop', offering multinational
customers a broad range of voice, data and video services between the US and
the UK.
The application is expected to face stiff opposition from BT's US
competitors, AT&amp;T, Sprint and MCI, who are likely to argue that US carriers
do not enjoy a similar freedom to operate in the UK, according to the
journal Communications Week International in an analysis published today.
The outcome of BT's application will therefore depend on discussions over
reciprocal market access between the US Federal Communications Commission
and Britain's Department of Trade and Industry.
Talks between the two agencies have been going on for some time but the
outcome remains unclear.
Mr Gary Bond, BT's director of services development, said yesterday that he
expected the UK would have to make concessions to the US carriers before
BT's application could be granted.
The advantage to customers of one-stop shopping for inter-national
telecommunications lies in dealing with a single organisation for network
management and billing, in contrast to the multiple regulatory and billing
organisations a company has to deal with currently. BT's large customers
could expect substantial discounts on their telecommunications bills as a
result, Mr Bond said.
BT's request for a common carrier licence in the US is an important part of
its plans to be one of a handful of global 'supercarriers' by 2000. Access
to the US market is essential to the success of its billion dollar-plus plan
to build a global network offering multinational customers a wide range of
services, including the transmission of data and image made possible by new
technology.
Codenamed 'Cyclone' within the organisation, the BT plan involves the
establishment of new switching centres in some 20 international cities to
handle the volume of traffic. For this it will need the agreement of
national authorities in each country.
The FCC is actively considering changes in its rules which would allow
foreign telecoms companies to operate in the US. French and German
telecommunications agencies, however, are liberalising their regimes at a
slower pace in spite of encouragement from the European Commission.

FT  08 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Estate agents
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When, like Gadarene swine, financial services companies rushed into estate
agency businesses in the late 1980s, the widely held view ran: nice theory,
shame about the timing. Urged on by the demons of deregulation, insurance
companies and mortgage lenders alike viewed estate agencies as useful
distribution channels for related financial services products. But the
theory remained unproven as the recession wrecked the experiment.
However, the incipient recovery in the housing market is reviving the
argument. Hambro Countrywide and Royal Insurance continue to believe in
estate agencies as effective distribution vehicles. Having survived the
worst, such businesses should now reap the rewards. Estate agencies should
return to profit as housing transactions pick up. A 10 per cent rise in
volume would transform their economics. Some optimists even suggest a 25 per
cent increase this year. Any recovery in house prices would be an added
bonus.
On this basis Abbey National would have done better to wait before putting
its chain on the market. But there would be no guarantee of a higher price
down the road. The industry's barriers to entry remain low. Any revival in
the housing business will see the competition multiply in a way that may
hurt the big chains. Successful estate agencies tend to be entrepreneurial
free-wheeling enterprises. That fits badly with the centralised mentality of
financial service organisations. The Prudential concluded that the
contradictions were too great and abandoned the whole attempt. Its early
retreat was certainly expensive. It may end up looking prudent.

FT  08 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK accounting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The definition of company earnings proposed by the Institute of Investment
Management and Research last week is unlikely to limit the confusion caused
by the new UK accounting standards. Its calculation of 'headline' earnings
differs from alternatives favoured by City firms. The IIMR includes major
restructuring costs in headline earnings, for example, even though such
costs are unlikely to recur. The definition favoured by BZW excludes such
costs on the grounds that the expenditure is something akin to a one-off
capital item.
In many cases either approach will come up with the same result. But without
consensus on such issues investors will be confronted by a plethora of
conflicting earnings figures, notably in cases where companies are in a
period of change and consistency matters most. It would be helpful if one
side or other could fall into line. That said, the idea of requiring
companies to disclose IIMR earnings as a condition of listing could be
counter-productive.
Companies are already required to disclose earnings according to FRS 3, the
new accounting standard which virtually abolishes extraordinary items. The
standard also allows companies to present an earnings figure of their own.
An institutionalised IIMR earnings figure would add a third 'official'
measure. The Accounting Standards Board is right to argue that no single
measure of company performance is adequate. But three alternative earnings
figures - with variations put forward by City firms - can hardly be what it
had in mind.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the clearest beneficiaries of sterling's devaluation has been the
UK's threadbare textiles industry. Having long been worn down by the heavy
pound, the industry's competitive outlook was transformed by Black
Wednesday. The market has been quick to appreciate the benefits. Textile
company shares have shot up by 40 per cent since then and stand at a 25 per
cent premium to the market.
Having moved so far so fast, the textile sector is beginning to slow down. A
two-way pull is now developing. It is easy to put together a scenario
suggesting there should be further gains as the UK recovery gathers pace. A
sustained upturn in consumer demand would allow retailers to pass on
imported inflation permitting an easing of pricing pressures on domestic
suppliers. Margins would recover even if volumes did not rise that sharply.
Higher exports and translation of overseas sales would further flatter
earnings.
The trouble is that the market is already taking this as read. The four
leading textiles companies are trading on fat premiums. They account for
almost three-quarters of the sector's Pounds 3.4bn capitalisation with few
undervalued second line companies to chase. Overseas earnings may also prove
elusive if, as Courtaulds Textiles suggested last week, continental European
retailers continue their severe destocking. Investors may be loath to
abandon a cyclical sector at this stage in the game but there are few
temptations to buy.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In its determination to act independently, the Bundesbank is toying with the
markets' emotions. The failure to cut official rates on Thursday distanced
the German central bank from the G7 meeting, and reflected caution about
stubborn domestic inflation. Friday's easing of money market rates indicated
justified concern about rapidly falling domestic output, as this week's
appalling results from the German chemical giants will confirm.
To be fair to the Bundesbank, conflicting economic signals and demands of
other EC members mean that it has had to tread a very careful path. It is
also keen to squeeze a credible fiscal package from Chancellor Kohl and the
Lander. Fortunately, there are signs that inflation is being squeezed. Bank
workers have accepted a 3.3 per cent wage settlement, and companies seem
finally to understand the need to cut costs. The much-heralded secular
decline in interest rates may soon be under way.
If short rates are about to fall, one might expect bond yields and equities
to follow. However, at 6.5 per cent bond yields are already 2 per cent lower
than those on bank deposits, so there is very limited room for further
falls. In the past German equities have not rallied until short rates fell
below bond yields. This time, however, foreign buyers have stepped in to
anticipate the rise. That may be premature given Germany's deep-seated
economic problems. Exports might possibly provide higher earnings if
overseas growth ignites. But the bias towards late cycle heavy capital goods
in the German market tells against it.

protest votes in Hesse local elections

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S extreme rightwing Republicans stole votes from mainstream parties
to make sweeping gains in local and city elections in the state of Hesse
yesterday.
The results stunned the Social Democrats (SPD) and gave an unexpected lift
to Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU), especially in large
cities. Against all expectations, the SPD share of the vote tumbled by 8.4
percentage points, while the CDU lost 2.3 percentage points, according to
provisional results.
The CDU displaced the SPD as the largest single party in the Frankfurt and
Kassel city councils, exit polls showed.
In Frankfurt, the largest and richest city in the state, the Republicans,
led by Mr Franz Schonhuber, a former SS officer, took 9.5 per cent of the
vote. In one depressed part of the inner city, they gained 14 per cent.
The CDU, which won 33 per cent against the SPD's 31 per cent share, ruled
out any coalition with the Republicans. The likely outcome appeared to be a
governing coalition comprising SPD, CDU and the Greens, the environmental
party.
Fewer than 70 per cent of voters went to the polls, compared with 77 per
cent in the last election in 1989. Statewide, the Republicans were
calculated to have won 8.3 per cent, against less than 1 per cent for
far-right parties last time.
However heartening for the embattled Mr Kohl, the result - in one of the
richest German states - will fuel domestic and international fears about the
rise to respectability of Germany's extreme right wing. The result is likely
to concentrate efforts by the government and opposition in Bonn to fill the
political vacuum at the centre before next year's state, European and
federal parliamentary elections.
The ruling coalition and opposition are divided on a range of issues,
including a solidarity pact to pay for German unification and the flood of
asylum seekers. Voters are also growing anxious about unemployment and the
economy's slide into recession.
While the Republicans gained support for their policies of containing
immigration and deporting 'criminal foreigners', other smaller parties also
benefited from protest votes.
The Greens, who are not represented in the federal parliament, increased
their support in Frankfurt from about 10 per cent to 14 per cent.
The liberal Free Democrats failed to take enough votes to gain
representation on the city council, but they improved their standing
statewide with an estimated 6 per cent of the vote.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Surge in confidence among UK directors, IoD reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence that the economy may be slowly emerging from recession
comes today from the Institute of Directors, which reports a surge in
confidence in Britain's boardrooms.
The IoD survey conducted among 305 directors - more than half of them
chairmen and managing directors - follows a concerted weekend effort led by
Mr John Major, the prime minister, to boost confidence that economic
recovery is under way.
The feeling among ministers that recovery has begun has strengthened their
conviction that Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, will announce in next
week's Budget a rise in personal taxation.
Speculation is growing that Mr Lamont will unveil a phased package of
increases including curbs on income tax allowances for the higher paid and
an extension of value added tax.
A staged move to restrict personal and other income tax allowances to the
basic rate of tax would eventually raise several billion pounds. Mr Lamont's
colleagues also expect domestic fuel and some other zero-rated goods and
services to be included in the value added tax net.
The more optimistic economic outlook is helped by fresh signs of a boost to
exports following sterling's devaluation after its suspension from the
European exchange rate mechanism.
British construction steel manufacturers are reporting a 15-fold increase in
invitations from foreign customers to bid for work, with firm orders now
starting to flow through.
Separately, the Confederation of British Industry claims there has been a
continuing fall in unit labour costs which should help manufacturing
competitiveness.
Last week, the housebuilding industry reported a rise of one-fifth in the
sale of new homes during the first eight weeks of 1993, while figures for
new car registrations suggested that a revival in the car market is
gathering momentum.
The IoD says that over half the directors asked in January and February were
more optimistic than in December about the economic outlook for 1993,
compared with 10 per cent in October.
Directors are even more buoyant about prospects for their own businesses,
with 60 per cent expecting an improvement in trading. But the IoD warns
that, unless consumer confidence also rises, economic recovery will remain
weak and fragile.
Most companies do not expect that an upturn in business will reduce
unemployment over the next six months but only 10 per cent believe that
their workforces will be cut further. Despite rising business volumes,
profit levels remain squeezed, with companies unable to pass on increased
costs to customers.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The pleas for manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME minister has said manufacturing matters and who could possibly
disagree? But to leap from that proposition to the belief that manufacturing
is more real and reliable than other forms of activity is heroic; to leap to
the view that manufacturing should be specially favoured by government could
prove disastrous.
People who believe that only manufacturing is economically important need to
wander about the industrial graveyards of eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union. People who believe that manufacturing must generate increased
employment in the UK need only look at the statistics for virtually all
developed economies, including Japan. It is rather more relevant that UK
manufacturing output last year was just 1 per cent higher than in 1973. This
does seem to be saying something, especially when the economy grew by more
than a third over the period and Britain went into deficit on manufactured
goods a decade ago.
In the long run an advanced country cannot increase its indebtedness to the
rest of the world without limit. So demand for and supply of tradeable goods
and services need to be roughly equal over the long run. Since manufacturing
is the preponderant tradeable element in the economy, its poor performance
must say something about the prospects for long-term economic growth.
Before deciding what needs to be done, however, one needs to understand why
manufacturing has grown so little. The most plausible explanation is that
deep-seated weaknesses of the economy show up in parts of the economy most
exposed to international competition. If so, the weakness of manufacturing
is not a cause of the UK's economic problems, but rather a symptom.
Two time scales
Possible remedies can be viewed on two different time scales. The worsening
position in the 1980s can, for example, be attributed to specific mistakes
in economic policy: too high an exchange rate, and too much stimulus to
demand. The short-term corrective - a massive real depreciation of sterling
 -has already been applied.
There may be more to it than that. Professor Nick Crafts, an economic
historian at Warwick University, points out that the UK had a 30 per cent
share of world trade in manufactures at the start of the century. It now has
less than 9 per cent. Germany had 20 per cent then and has 20 per cent now.
In Prof Crafts' view, Germany's success can be put down to a policy of
accumulating long-term assets such as human skills and research. UK
manufacturers are hampered by short-term pressures from their shareholders.
The answer is to change company law and make takeovers more difficult.
At this point one starts to feel uneasy. It is one thing to argue that the
long-term solution for British manufacturers is to establish a more stable
and reciprocal relationship with both capital and labour, on the German and
Japanese model. But the beneficial effects of any changes in the law would
be uncertain, while they would impose substantial costs.
International exposure
Meanwhile, the government is under pressure to help industry on other
familiar fronts, such as export credits and advance corporation tax. On the
first, it can be argued that the chief point of export credits is to help
companies do business in countries where there is little security of
payment. Shipping out goods without payment is not an export but a gift,
however financed.
As for ACT, the system has anomalies. But the simple answer is to pay less
in dividends. This brings us back to short-termism and the need for a more
stable relationship between companies and shareholders. But this is a matter
best hammered out between the parties themselves.
Manufacturing is not self-evidently more important than all other
activities. It is just more enfeebled because it is more internationally
exposed. Salvation does not lie in schemes in favour of manufacturing as a
whole, still less in favour of particular industries. The answer lies partly
in government policies that improve the performance of the UK economy. But
it also lies in the hands of British industrialists. If the Japanese can
make internationally competitive products in the UK, why do their British
equivalents find this so difficult?

FT  08 MAR 93 / Leading Article: The stakes in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH LONDON and Beijing apparently preparing to resume talks on Hong Kong
and the governor calling for a 'spirit of realism' about them, the people of
the colony might be getting a familiar feeling: that their future is about
to be decided without their participation. Mr Chris Patten may vow that the
Legislative Council (LegCo) will never be a rubber stamp for the executive,
but it is difficult to see how the governments concerned would proceed if an
eventual Sino-British agreement were rejected by LegCo.
Nevertheless, the conciliatory noises emanating from both sides do not
necessarily presage the end of Mr Patten's proposals for political
development. China's blanket opposition to them last October has now been
replaced by a willingness to talk. Even if that is in essence a delaying
tactic, it also represents an acknowledgement that its propaganda campaign
against the governor has failed. Support in London remains solid, and the
community in Hong Kong is still broadly behind him. Moreover, Mr Patten's
proposals have brought a deepening of political debate within Hong Kong. The
colony's politicians have assumed a greater responsibility for its future,
and this will be hard for the future sovereign power to ignore. China has
consistently maintained that the future of Hong Kong is a matter for talks
with Britain, not with the Hong Kong government and certainly not with
LegCo. But it would now have to hesitate before insisting on a solution
which ignored LegCo's express wishes.
Differing views
As it will be in charge in a little over four years, China stands to gain
from satisfactory resolution of this problem - in effect, a test of the 'one
country, two systems' approach which Mr Deng Xiaoping devised as the means
to re-absorb lost territories. There can be little real confidence in Hong
Kong's economic future if Beijing does not allow it to develop a system of
its own, within the framework already agreed between Britain and China.
Clearly there are differing views within the Chinese government about how to
handle the present dispute. While systematically attempting to undermine the
governor, the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council is
participating in an investment venture which will give it a direct stake in
maintaining the confidence of financial markets. In 1992 alone, China is
estimated to have invested USDollars 20bn in Hong Kong. Planned listings of
Chinese companies on the Hong Kong stock market indicate a central role for
the territory in China's development. With its stake in Hong Kong's future
growing, Beijing has an interest in obtaining a solution of the present
dispute which bolsters confidence.
Room for compromise
Despite the apparent gulf between London and Beijing on political
development, there is scope for a compromise which could satisfy both sides,
combining convergence with the post-1997 Basic Law and greater democratic
representation. This must be the goal of any talks. Such a compromise would
greatly bolster confidence and would probably meet one of Mr Patten's key
principles - that the solution be acceptable to the people of Hong Kong. He
has said from the start that the Hong Kong community's desire for more
democracy was balanced by a desire for convergence with the Basic Law, and
that China's opinions had to be taken into account.
Since it would be silly to squander the opportunity for talks by precipitate
action, the current delay in putting Mr Patten's programme to LegCo is not
important. But LegCo must eventually be allowed to debate amended proposals,
or the current ones if there are no Sino-British talks.
The fact that the possibility for compromise exists does not, of course,
mean that there will be one. China has got virtually everything it wanted
out of talks with Britain on Hong Kong. But regardless of the finer points
of negotiation, Mr Patten's open approach has forced greater recognition of
the realities of Hong Kong's future and has drawn Hong Kong more into the
process of developing its own 'system'. It is good for the long-term
interests of Hong Kong - and therefore, ultimately, of China. He deserves
continuing support.

Premier Major's new found concern that honours should go only to those who
patently deserve them is shared by many South Americans. Having noted
Argentinian president Carlos Menem's decoration of Chile's Augusto Pinochet,
they are puzzled by what the Chilean general has done to merit the award.
After all, Pinochet is most memorably linked with Argentina as Chile's
president when the two countries almost went to war over territorial
disputes in the 1970s. Moreover, he has scarcely earned democrats' plaudits
in later years.
Before stepping down as dictator, he ensured he would stay probably the only
head of a country's armed forces who is not even nominally under
presidential control. As such, he has been a constant thorn in the flesh of
his democratically elected successor Patricio Aylwin.
But that perhaps solves the puzzle, for when Chile's present president
handed a gong to the former Argentinian president Raul Alfonsin, the
recipient's main political enemy Carlos Menem was sore miffed. So the latest
award may be less to honour Pinochet than to spite Aylwin.

Race against the clock. That is the message of new statistics for hurried
drivers using London's notorious M25 motorway. The Automobile Association
says that of the 403 serious delays on the orbital road last year, the
majority were on the clockwise carriageway.
Mind you, the benefit of travelling in the other direction is scarcely
compelling. The clockwise ring had 206 hold-ups, one for every 1,017 yards
of its 119 miles. The opposite carriageway had 197, one for every 1,063
yards or, in terms of delay-free distance, an extra 139ft 4in.

However anxious anyone may be to flatter Italian business contacts nowadays,
it would be as well to avoid referring to them as VIPs. With the
anti-corruption clampdown in their country, the acronym has come to stand
not so much for 'very important person', as for visto in prigione or 'seen
in prison.'

What's blighting Britain's budding bankers? Passes in the customer services
section of their chartered institute's exams last May came out at a
miserable 22 per cent of entrants, despite instructions to markers to look
more for good than bad points.
Gobbledegooked answers is the main culprit, suggests the relevant chief
examiner Richard Hands, who evidently sees the said lack of clarity as more
than an academic problem. 'Many complaints concerning bank services stem
from a failure to provide an adequate explanation to the customer,' he
writes in the institute's journal.
But lack of empathy is also at fault, to judge by his hints for future
candidates. It is scarcely fitting for bank staff to try to interest newly
jobless customers in long-term investments such as pensions, for instance,
or to advise them to put part of their redundancy money towards repaying 'an
existing affordable mortgage'.
Particularly not a bank mortgage, one assumes.
Oh . . . and candidates should not be misled by textbook references to the
average margin on personal lending being between 3 and 6 per cent. 'Such
generalisations no longer work,' says Hands. 'Personal loans currently carry
APRs in the order of 20 per cent against a base rate of, say, 7 per cent.
Unauthorised borrowing can be charged at 30 per cent or more]'
The exclamation mark, by the way, is his.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Observer: A yen for altruism
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The last country either Bill Clinton or Boris Yeltsin probably thinks
deserves a good turn from them at the moment is Japan. The US president
thinks it should bring down its trade surplus. His Russian counterpart
thinks it ought to be less tight-fisted with aid.
So it is a testimony to their altruism that they should be combining to
thrust their own nations' money into Japanese pockets at their summit
meeting in Vancouver next month - unless their supposedly omniscient
advisers have made a boob.
In choosing the Pan-Pacific Hotel as the summit's venue they perhaps didn't
twig that, like several more of Vancouver's top hostelries, it is owned by a
Japanese group, in this case the Tokyu conglomerate.
Still, all may be forgiven once the two presidents arrive. The hotel sits
atop Canada Place, the waterfront convention centre whose giant Teflon sails
bear a passing resemblance to the Sydney Opera House. The views over Burrard
Inlet and the snow-capped mountains beyond are superb.
The Pan-Pacific is especially proud of its kitchen. Its executive chef was a
member of the Canadian team which won last year's Culinary Olympics in
Frankfurt. Almost as distinguished is one of the sous-chefs, Enrico
Balestra, a former opera singer who provides the entertainment at an
'Italian Opera Buffet' in one of the restaurants each Friday night.
Clinton and Yeltsin will be spared that treat, however, as the summit
doesn't start until the Saturday.

FT  08 MAR 93 / The hottest act in town: Microsoft and Intel are seeking to
reinforce their dominance in information technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Welcome to the Bill and Andy Show,' says Bill Gates, chairman of Microsoft,
as he mounts a stage with Andrew Grove, chief executive and president of
Intel, to introduce the latest product of their companies' joint efforts to
bring video pictures to the personal computer screen.
Lately, the 'Bill and Andy Show' has become the most closely watched act on
the information technology stage as Intel and Microsoft assume the role of
industry leaders against a backdrop of rapidly shifting technology trends.
Long the dominant suppliers of microprocessors and personal computer
software - the 'brains' inside the personal computer and the programs that
control its functions - Intel and Microsoft have emerged over the past
couple of years as the most powerful companies in the computer industry.
Not since the heyday of International Business Machines has there been such
a concentration of power in the sector. Just as 'Big Blue' was unassailable
in the 1970s and early 1980s, now Intel and Microsoft appear unbeatable.
Each company commands its field - Intel as the world's largest chipmaker and
Microsoft as by far the biggest supplier of PC software.
However, as the West Coast duo - Intel of California and Microsoft of
Washington state - prepare to expand their territory beyond the PC market
with the introduction of more powerful chips and software for
higher-performance computers, their strength is about to be put to the test.
Both aim to use their mastery of the PC market to dominate the next phase of
computing technology as microprocessor chips become the building blocks for
more powerful 'servers' - computers that feed information to networked PCs.
'The microprocessor chip has destroyed the oligopoly of the mainframe and
minicomputer makers,' says Andrew Grove. Invented over 20 years ago by
Intel, this miniature information processor has replaced custom-designed
processing units and facilitated the mass production of personal computers.
Microprocessors have now become so powerful that they rival the performance
of minicomputers and mainframes, the traditional workhorses of information
processing technology.
'The model of the 'old' computer industry has been broken by the
microprocessor,' says Mike Maples, executive vice president of Microsoft.
'In the past, the manufacture of computers, the creation of software and
support services were all provided by a few tightly integrated companies
such as IBM and Digital Equipment.'
This structure is being 'bulldozed' by the advent of low-cost computers
based on microprocessors, says Grove. The 'new' computer industry is
becoming increasingly segmented into hardware, semiconductor, software and
service specialists.
IBM's financial problems demonstrate the impact of this shift in the balance
of power. In January, it reported net losses of almost Dollars 5bn for 1992
and it is rapidly 'downsizing'. It plans to cut 25,000 jobs this year after
reducing its workforce by more than 40,000 last year.
The same technology and market forces that have blown IBM off course have
benefited Intel and Microsoft. Intel's 1992 sales rose 22 per cent to
Dollars 5.84bn and net profits were up 30 per cent at Dollars 1.07bn. For
fiscal 1992 ending in June, Microsoft recorded a 50 per cent jump in
revenues to Dollars 2.8bn, while net income rose 53 per cent to Dollars
708m.
Microsoft and Intel are dwarfed by IBM's revenues - Dollars 64bn in 1992 -
but they have become the 'keepers of the flame, the keepers of industry
standards', says Roger McNamee, of Integral Capital Partners, an investment
partnership.
Computer users now look to them, rather than to IBM, to map out the future
of information technology. 'Microsoft's products are at the forefront of
most customers' long-term computer systems strategies,' says Mort Rosenthal,
chairman of Corporate Software, a US distributor of software.
But doing business with Microsoft 'is like water-skiing behind the Queen
Mary,' he says. 'When you do business with Microsoft you do business their
way.'
Similarly, computer manufacturers are forced to follow Intel's lead. As the
sole supplier of leading-edge microprocessors, Intel can dictate when new
computers are introduced by its customers. In a recent confidential letter
to customers Intel even specified the prices that it expects them to set for
the next generation of PCs.
If Intel's customers are unhappy, they are not saying so publicly.
Competitors, however, are less reticent. Intel has built an 'illicit
monopoly' in the microprocessor market, says W J Sanders III, chairman and
chief executive of Advanced Micro Devices, a semiconductor rival that has
engaged in a legal feud with Intel over rights to microprocessor technology.
Microsoft has also been accused of abusing its power. In particular,
competitors charge that its use of 'per-processor' licensing arrangements
for PC software restricts competition. Under these arrangements, Microsoft
gives discounts to PC makers who agree to pay a licensing fee for every PC
they sell. This makes it difficult for competitors to persuade PC makers to
offer alternative operating systems.
Such complaints have drawn the attention of the US Federal Trade Commission,
which recently completed anti-trust investigations of both companies. The
outcomes of these investigations have yet to be determined. However, the FTC
is not expected to take action against Intel and the commission last month
split over whether to seek an injunction against Microsoft.
Even if the FTC does nothing, the dominance of Intel and Microsoft will
remain a controversial issue in the computer industry. Steve Jobs, chairman
of Next Computer and the former chairman of Apple Computer, has publicly
called for the break-up of Microsoft. He fears the company's control over
the software market discourages innovation and limits competition.
Microsoft maintains that complaints by rivals are just 'sour grapes'.
'Leading an industry does not mean that you win popularity contests,' says
Maples, who spent 23 years at IBM before joining Microsoft. He says that
Microsoft has become the industry's latest whipping boy, just as IBM was.
Despite such comparisons with IBM, Microsoft and Intel claim they have no
ambitions to become industrial giants. 'We are a maker of building blocks,'
says Grove of Intel. The company will continue to concentrate primarily on
manufacturing chips and PC add-on circuit boards, he says. Microsoft also
aims to remain focused on its 'core competences' - developing and selling
software that makes computers easier to use. 'We have avoided getting into
the hardware business,' says Maples, adding that Microsoft is deliberately
limiting its rate of growth. 'It is not that there aren't plenty of
opportunities, but you can get fat and lazy' he explains.
Intel and Microsoft nonetheless have plans to expand their markets with
important products that will be launched shortly. These are:
Pentium: This month Intel will unveil its fifth-generation microprocessor.
At least twice as powerful as the Intel486, the current top-selling
microprocessor, Pentium is intended to power a new generation of
high-performance desktop computers and PC network servers.
Windows NT (New Technology). Now expected in May, Microsoft's NT will
combine the features of the popular 'Windows' program that enables PC
functions to be selected by a pointing device with advanced capabilities
such as 'multi-tasking' - the performance of several tasks simultaneously.
The combination means it should be possible, for example, to search through
a data-base while writing a document.
Intel and Microsoft aim to cement their industry leadership with these new
products. But while industry analysts have high expectations for both
Windows NT and Pentium, there are significant hurdles.
For NT, success depends on breaking into a market in which Microsoft has
little experience. Whereas its current products are aimed at individual PC
users, NT is designed for critical applications within industry such as
management of corporate databases.
'If somebody's PC word-processing program stops working, it is a big
inconvenience to that person. But if a bank's transaction register fails,
millions of dollars may be lost. Microsoft has no experience in supporting
such customers,' says Mr Bill Bluestein, senior market analyst at Forrester
Research, a market research and consulting group.
Windows NT may also face stiff competition from Unix, the widely-used
operating system developed by AT&amp;T and recently acquired by Novell, one of
Microsoft's few serious rivals.
Unix supporters dismiss NT as an unknown entity. 'NT is like a blind date -
you don't know what she is going to look like until she turns up at the
door,' says Scott McNealy, chairman and chief executive of Sun Microsystems.
Intel's Pentium faces fewer obstacles, but it is not without competition,
some of it created by Windows NT. The new Microsoft program will be able to
run on microprocessors from Intel's rivals such as Digital Equipment and
Intergraph. However, these companies pose little threat to Intel's dominance
in the PC market because they do not have the production capacity to make
the millions of microprocessors that the PC industry consumes each year.
More challenging are rivals such as AMD that are producing similar versions
of Intel's existing products. Already, AMD has claimed more than 50 per cent
of the market for 386s, the third generation of Intel microprocessors.
The almost simultaneous introduction of Pentium and Windows NT 'is a total
coincidence' says Paul Maritz, Microsoft senior vice president. But the two
companies did work closely in the development of the products.
Such collaboration has been common since Intel and Microsoft were chosen by
IBM to supply microprocessors and software for its original PC more than 10
years ago.
'We have a very large area of common interest. We co-operate very well and
our technical people spend a lot of time together,' says Maples. 'Both
companies have a vested interest in the structure of the industry as it
exists today,' adds Maritz, who worked for five years at Intel before
joining Microsoft. 'We are both motivated to ensure that it keeps growing.'
To this end, they are jointly proposing an industry standard for video
display technology which allows the transmission of moving pictures on
computer screens.
Yet both Microsoft and Intel have other partners. 'The success of Microsoft
can't be tied to the success of Intel,' Maples says. 'If either one of us
drops the ball there are others ready to pick it up,' agrees Grove.
The partnership is expected to face increasing pressure. 'The alliance
between Microsoft and Intel is a marriage of convenience,' says Roger
McNamee. 'It has been rewarding to both companies, but the opportunities for
Microsoft's interests to diverge from those of Intel are increasing with the
introduction of Windows NT. As the focus moves from stand-alone desktop PCs
to networks, pressure is mounting for Microsoft to make its systems
compatible with multiple (microprocessor) platforms.'
Both Intel and Microsoft may also prove vulnerable to the next 'technology
shift'; the introduction of a radically new technology.
'That is the great danger. We think about it a lot,' acknowledges Maritz.
One such shift which concerns Microsoft and Intel is the emergence of
pocket-sized 'personal communicators', devices that combine a PC, a
telephone and a facsimile machine in a hand-held device.
'The benefits of compatibility with existing PC standards are not clear in
this emerging market,' says McNamee. Intel and Microsoft could be followers,
rather than leaders, in what many industry analysts are predicting will
become a multi-billion dollar market.
Another threat could be 'object-oriented technology'; a method of
streamlining the lengthy process of writing new software application
programs. James Cannavino, IBM senior vice president, predicts that
'objects' will sharply increase the productivity of programmers. IBM is in
the forefront of this technology through a joint venture with Apple
Computer, called Taligent. But Maritz dismisses IBM's claims.
'Object-oriented technology is the software industry equivalent of
'Ingredient X' in soap powder,' he says.
IBM is also working with Apple and Motorola, the number two US chip maker,
on a range of microprocessors that could dislodge Intel's power in the PC
sector. But Grove doesn't give the IBM alliance much chance of beating Intel
in the microprocessor market. 'They are building a new railroad to a
different gauge,' he says. The value of existing 'rolling stock', or
software in the computer world, is a big disincentive to change.
Yet the history of the computer industry suggests that technological change
will overtake today's industry stars. While 'Bill and Andy' hold centre
stage in today's IT show, the lead roles have yet to be cast in the next act
of this industry drama. There are plenty of emerging players and established
acts waiting in the wings for an opportunity to upstage them.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: Maxwell pensioners deserve security without further
delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH TRENCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your report on the Serious Fraud Office's effectively stopping the
select committee's investigation into the Maxwell pensions scandal ('Maxwell
pensioners suffer setback', February 27) highlights the frustration and
mental anguish the pensioners have been suffering for more than a year.
The slow process of criminal justice for the few is hampering moral justice
for 20,000. The select committee chairman, Frank Field, says his inquiries
will continue after relevant criminal proceedings have been completed. Best
estimates are that the Maxwell trials will not even begin before the end of
next year.
The Maxwell pensioners have claimed that the cause of their dilemma is
inadequate protection of pension investment under the Finance Services Act
and lack of proper delegation of regulatory powers by the Department of
Trade and Industry to the lnvestment Management Regulatory Organisation. The
report on lMRO's actions in relation to Maxwell pension funds was promised
by the Securities and Investments Board to Maxwell pensioners early last
year.
Fortuitously for some, it was not produced until after the arrest of the
Maxwells in June. The report immediately became sub judice, destroying at a
stroke the pensioners opportunity to prove quickly their case for
compensation.
When the report finally surfaces for Mr Field's committee to resume its
investigations it will be useless to many pensioners. By then several
hundred will have died.
The human dimension of the misery of the Maxwell pensioners makes this a
City and political scandal that will not go away. With regulation as it now
stands, it could be argued that anyone investing in a pension scheme should
insure it against fraud, as they would insure their home against fire.
The government should act now to first give long-term security to the
Maxwell victims and then quickly to implement change in an effort to give
pensions back the image of security they once enjoyed.

FT  08 MAR 93 / A brief to build bridges: Hans van den Broek, the new EC
commissioner for external political relations, talks to Lionel Barber and
David Gardner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LIONEL BARBER and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Hans van den Broek is a man trying to carve out a new role, both for
himself and the European Community. After 10 years as Dutch foreign
minister, he has come to Brussels to stake out what he sees as a growing
role for the European Commission in framing a common foreign and security
policy for Europe. His ambition is tempered by realism.
The backdrop to his new job as the European commissioner responsible for
external political relations could hardly be more unfavourable. Europe is
stuck in the worst recession since the second world war, feeding into a
crisis of confidence caused by the delay of Denmark and the UK in ratifying
the Maastricht treaty, the foundation text for the new EC foreign policy.
As if this were not enough, Mr Van den Broek is fighting for elbow room
inside the Commission which has chosen to divide the foreign affairs
portfolio between himself and Sir Leon Brittan. Sir Leon takes charge of
trade, relations with industrialised countries and aid to eastern Europe.
Since trade has until now been the substantive foreign business of the EC,
the Brittan camp has been crowing about where the real power lies.
'Van den Broek will do the hand-shaking; Leon will do the horse-trading,'
smirked one of Sir Leon's allies.
Sitting in front of two Dutch masters in his office last Friday, Mr Van den
Broek, a patient man with a faintly clerical air, appeared relaxed about a
job he insisted he had sought. True, he was still struggling with Sir Leon
over the division of power and staff within the bureaucracy, which he
described as a 'constructive uphill fight'. But he remained confident that
he would secure 'certain minimum tools' to do his job.
Mr Van den Broek is clear there is a job to be done. After the collapse of
communism in the east and amid doubts about the long-term military
commitment of the US to Europe, the EC - until now a purely civil power - is
moving hesitantly to fill the vacuum. 'Maastricht is about coming to grips
with our international political role,' he says.
This means, in his view, enlarging the EC to bring in new members, starting
with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Norway; involving eastern Europe
immediately in consultations on the political future of the Continent;
standing behind the Russian reform effort; and fashioning credible solutions
to the conflict in former Yugoslavia, which Mr Van den Broek is convinced
must involve the US and Russia.
Until Maastricht is ratified, negotiations on enlargement form the backbone
of Mr Van den Broek's job. Talks began last month with the Austrians, Swedes
and Finns, with a view to accession in 1995. The Dutchman warned at the time
that these negotiations would not be a walk-over. Public opinion in the
Nordic countries remains suspicious of European integration, though this may
change if the Danes approve Maastricht in a second referendum in May.
It remains EC policy that the newcomers cannot expect Denmark's special
treaty opt-outs. 'We do feel we have to be strict on the conditions.' But he
stresses: 'It is our ultimate conviction - though it is a choice to be made
by the applicants - that membership is in our interest and theirs.'
On eastern Europe, Mr Van den Broek is insistent that 'we need to make clear
that they belong to the fact of European construction'. By this, the
commissioner means that ways must be found to bind the former communist
satellites into western Europe, until such time as their economies can
withstand the rigours of full EC membership.
The idea is to expand trade, technology and market access to the east
Europeans under the so-called EC association agreements. A second, still
inchoate proposal is to hold joint political councils with a view to
deciding matters of common interest.
The process of building bridges to the east is running at several speeds.
Poland, Hungary and the Czech and Slovak republics are in the vanguard,
followed by Romania, Bulgaria and Albania. Eventually, Mr Van den Broek can
foresee the Baltic republics coming aboard.
The commissioner believes that closer ties of this nature could act as a
catalyst to closer economic integration between eastern and western Europe.
But he is honest enough to admit that the EC has not been sufficiently
generous with market access. 'I sense a growing sentiment among member
states that we have to make a greater effort.'
On Russia, Mr Van den Broek is much less categorical. The economy is
struggling, yet amid the chaos there are still untapped western credit
lines: 'I am not convinced that financial transfers are the main problem.'
Instead, he calls for the whole international community to show unequivocal
'solidarity' with Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president.
On March 26-27, Mr Van den Broek and a troika of EC foreign ministers will
be in Moscow hoping to hear from Mr Yeltsin 'what other means may be needed'
to underpin economic and political reform. As a long-time Atlanticist -
'Euro-Atlanticist', he corrects - the Dutchman is convinced of the need for
a full US role. 'The US remains, also for (us in) Europe, the natural
counterpart of Russia.'
It is not, therefore, surprising to learn that Mr Van den Broek has been
quietly urging EC support for President Clinton's Bosnian air-drop
initiative. This is part of a broader view that the US - and most likely
Russia - must be involved in enforcing a political settlement in former
Yugoslavia, if and when it comes. The problem in the past was that 'the
parties were led to believe that undertakings reached at the negotiating
table would never be enforced'.
Mr Van den Broek presided over the purely European effort to broker peace in
Yugoslavia when he chaired the EC's Council of Ministers in the second half
of 1991. While loath to undervalue the EC's role as by far the largest donor
of humanitarian aid, he acknowledges that 'the Community has often given the
impression of division', notably when Germany pressured the 12 into
premature recognition of Croatia in January 1992.
He draws the comparison with the EC's swift and united response to the
August 1991 coup attempt in Moscow. Here the Community had an old enemy in
its sights, and reacted almost reflexively. Post-cold war, however, the
Community was forced to deal with a resurgence of ethnic rivalries and
nationalism in the east which in the west had largely been consigned to the
past. The result was that France recalled its historic links with Serbia and
Germany its ties with Croatia. The Franco-German axis which carries the EC
forward did not work.
At the time, as the commissioner acknowledges, he was bitterly at odds with
Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, then Germany's foreign minister. Mr Van den Broek
now wonders whether 'my colleague Mr Genscher would be as angry with me
about my position (on recognition of Croatia) as he was then'.
The lesson he believes the EC should draw applies not only to Yugoslavia,
but also to its post-cold war relationship with the fragmenting east of the
Continent as a whole. 'I do not dispute the right of self-determination for
one moment. But are we also prepared to defend that recognition in the event
of an appalling state of violence - the extent of which we could barely
imagine?'

FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: Sellafield discharge actually very small
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr J R S GUINNESS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Bronwen Maddox reports ('Sellafield has second leak', February 26) that
British Nuclear Fuels discharged more than seven times the usual weekly
amount of radioactive iodine at the Sellafield nuclear site during the week
ending February 13.
To the layman this would appear to be a huge amount. But the radioactive
impact of this release on the most exposed member of the public living near
the site is equivalent to that which would take place during a 15-minute
flight on a passenger aircraft.
The fact that we have such sophisticated measuring devices at Sellafield
which can detect such minute amounts should, in itself, be reassuring to the
public. Unfortunately, detecting discharges which result in such small
dosages requires detailed analysis. That inevitably means a delay between
the actual release and its detection. That is why there is a delay in the
reporting of such incidents.

Sir, Barry Riley ('The long view', February 27/28) is of course correct when
he points out that British companies pay out too much dividend and retain
insufficient funds for reinvestment.
The chancellor can mitigate this situation at no cost to the Treasury by
increasing taxes on distributed profits and/or reducing taxes on profits
retained for reinvestment.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: BR's pension obligation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr SEAN HAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I concur with your view ('Pensions at Risk', March 3) that dilution of
benefits will do nothing to enhance confidence in a pensions system which
has suffered gravely from the activities of the late Robert Maxwell.
Reviewing the government's proposals for railway pensions after
privatisation, I came across the following paragraph: 'The government will
need to be satisfied that the method of allocation of surplus assets strikes
a fair balance between all interested parties, including contributing
members, pensioners, deferred pensioners, current and prospective employers,
and the taxpayer who is contributing through the government support
contributions.'
A statement like this from any other sponsoring employer of an occupational
pension fund would raise eyebrows even of those taking the broadest view of
conflicts of interest.
It seems to me that the government is in a position comparable to that of an
employer in such a scheme. Perhaps the most appropriate way to determine the
distribution of surplus assets within the BR's pension fund is by the
appointment of a truly independent trustee body.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Long wait for entry: Western misgivings as China negotiates
to join the Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
China this year will join the world's top 10 traders, but it is finding this
exclusive club not as welcoming as it might have expected.
The Chinese are being obliged to pay much more attention to trade
sensitivities than ever before. Beijing's protracted negotiations on
accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade have provided a
focus for the misgivings felt by China's main trading partners over the
spectacular improvement in its export performance in the past few years.
For the US, the European Community and Japan, the prospect of China as a
world trade power that plays by its own rules is no longer distant. And it
should be no surprise that they are all trying, perhaps belatedly, to ensure
they are not disadvantaged as competition intensifies.
The challenge they face is writ large in their ballooning trade deficits
with China: the US deficit in 1992 exceeded Dollars 18bn, the EC's reached
Dollars 9.3bn, and Japan's was about Dollars 5bn.
In response to growing restiveness among its main trading partners, China
has promised to send buying missions to the US and to Europe. Its officials
have also been talking China up as a market for raw materials and equipment.
They recently reiterated their forecast of projected imports worth Dollars
350bn to Dollars 400bn in the current 1991-1995 five-year plan.
Chinese officials have also been making much of the fact that the country's
overall trade surplus was down sharply last year to Dollars 4.4bn, compared
with Dollars 9bn in 1991. They expect it to shrink further this year.
Western governments tend to view these Chinese statements and manoeuvres as
little more than a smokescreen, and are maintaining pressure on Beijing to
liberalise its trade regime and so enhance opportunities for foreign entry
to the Chinese market.
In Beijing last week, Mr Douglas Newkirk, the assistant US trade
representative, spelt out what he said were minimum conditions for China's
accession to Gatt. These included: a single national trade policy common to
all provinces and regions; full transparency of trade regulations (until
recently trade was governed by a plethora of secret rules); the gradual
removal of non-tariff barriers; a commitment to move to a full market
economy; and acceptance of safeguards to protect Gatt signatories from a
possible surge in Chinese exports.
It is the latter concern, given China's enormous strides recently as an
export power, that is weighing most heavily with the west. An EC official
said in Beijing that the Community's principal requirement was a strong
safeguards clause, and it was most unlikely to accept anything less.
According to the EC representative, in spite of China's claims to have
embarked on a concerted process of trade liberalisation, barriers to entry
to the China market abound. Many are derived from bureaucratic interference,
such as the difficulties EC dairy products faced overcoming the sometimes
arbitrarily applied health regulations.
A decade or so ago China ranked 20th among trading nations with exports of
about Dollars 21bn (see chart), which represented less than 1 per cent of
world trade. Projected exports this year of Dollars 100bn would account for
more than 2.5 per cent of world trade.
The range and quality of its products are also showing marked improvement,
with a continuing shift towards more sophisticated manufactured items,
including machinery and transport equipment - sectors where there has been
high foreign investment.
Exports of these items rose by about 86 per cent in the first nine months of
1992 compared with the same period a year earlier. They accounted for 16 per
cent of total exports last year, up sharply from only 6 per cent in 1988.
China's trading partners have not overlooked the fact that investment is
pouring into export-generating industries. In the first 10 months of 1992,
some Dollars 37bn was committed to new projects, the bulk located in special
economic zones in coastal regions. This compares with Dollars 48bn of
contracted direct foreign investment for the previous 13 years of the 'open
door' policy.
Chinese officials, who a few months ago were predicting that China's
accession to Gatt would be a formality, appear to have been taken aback by
what they regard as an unhelpful posture adopted by the west. In last week's
Gatt negotiations, Beijing resisted US pressure to agree to a safeguards
clause, which would enable individual signatories to impose quota
restrictions on items such as textiles and electronic products. It also
refused to embrace full market price reform as an eventual goal.
Mr Newkirk charged that China had backed away from earlier commitments. The
Chinese, for their part, accuse the west, and the US in particular, of
moving the goalposts in the Gatt negotiations.
Beijing is certain to have been disappointed by Mr Newkirk's comment that it
was still a 'long way' from fulfilling the requirements of Gatt accession.
It would also not have been impressed by his observation that China's
situation was unique because 'Gatt was not written with a socialist market
economy in mind'. This, Mr Newkirk said, was why it was necessary to
negotiate a 'boutique protocol aimed exactly and uniquely at the Chinese
system'.
The Chinese, who are anxious to resolve the Gatt issue quickly to reduce
bilateral trade pressures, say it is unfair to impose a special safeguards
system on them when other recent signatories, such as several of the former
eastern bloc states, have not been obliged to accept the same conditions.
On the eve of the resumption of the talks, Mr Li Zhongzhou, deputy
director-general of China's powerful Department of International Trade and
Economic Relations, told foreign diplomats that recent reforms had 'brought
China's trade regime into conformity with the requirements of Gatt'.
He cited a long list of reforms, including reductions in import duties, a
7.3 per cent drop in the general level of tariffs by the removal of
two-thirds of products from the list of 53 still subject to import
licensing; and steps towards abolishing about 75 per cent of China's
non-tariff barriers.
'These commitments,' Mr Li said, 'represent a great challenge requiring
domestic industries to make difficult policy adjustments in the face of
stronger international competition.
'If these adjustments are reciprocated by greater market access for Chinese
goods, our enterprises will manage to overcome the difficulties of
adjustment,' he added.
China's trading partners, however, burdened by yawning trade deficits, are
not showing much sympathy for the teething problems that Chinese industry
might encounter in the early stages of trade liberalisation.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Letter: Two sides to stories of oppressed Russians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EUGENE M IWANCIW
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Financial Times is to be applauded for its editorial ('Russia's
backyard', March 2).
President Yeltsin's call for the United Nations to grant Russia 'special
powers' is simply a request for justification of Russian imperialism. Russia
is not the solution but the problem in many of the conflicts in the former
Soviet Union. In Moldova, for example, it is the Russian 14th army which
induced the conflict among the various ethnic groups. It is the Russian 14th
army which is now illegally dismembering this sovereign nation.
While the FT expresses concern about treatment of the 25m ethnic Russians
living outside Russia, it expresses no such concern about Russian treatment
of a similar number of non-Russians living in Russia. While there are about
11m Russians in Ukraine (22 per cent of the population), almost 50 per cent
of the schools are taught in the Russian language. But there are no
Ukrainian-language schools for the 9m Ukrainians living in Russia (almost 1m
in Moscow alone). Yet Russia claims Russians in Ukraine need protection]
The reaction of some of the newly independent nations toward Russians, if
not defensible, is at least understandable. Many of the Russians came to
these nations as conquerors and now expect to retain their privileged
positions while refusing even to learn the local language.
Did the world expect France to continue the special privileges of German
occupiers at the end of the second world war? The only differences are that
the Russians occupied these nations longer and were more vicious toward the
native populations.
Let us keep these issues in perspective and not be swayed by a new wave of
propaganda emanating from Moscow.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Arts: Proud to be Paris - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Any Londoner must envy Paris. It is a capital city with a strong sense of
its own identity. It is a city with a government. It is a city devoted to
culture and the finer arts of civilisation. It is a city with a working and
up-to-date infrastructure. During the last 20 years it has become a city of
importance in the history of contemporary architecture. Londoners can gain
some sense of this creative excitement at Paris: A City in the Making, an
exhibition at the French Institute in Queensberry Place.
The exhibition is an offshoot of the Pavillon de l'Arsenal in Paris, a
centre founded in 1989 to inform Parisians about changes in the planning and
development of their city. Pavillon de l'Arsenal, housed in a 19th century
glass and steel building on the Boulevard Morland in the IVe district of
Paris, was the brain child of M. Jaques Chirac, as mayor of Paris. At its
heart is a great model of Paris connected to a tactile screen computer.
Visitors ask the computer questions, and it answers through a video disc
while a laser ray spotlights the relevant sector of the model.
Apart from all this high level technology the Pavillon de l'Arsenal
publishes books, runs a library on Paris, and organises regular temporary
exhibitions. The one in London follows many of the themes of the permanent
display in Paris. Alas, the great model does not travel and so the
exhibition is relatively hard work: you must enjoy reading panels and
unravelling plans.
Unlike the recent Vision for London model and exhibition at the Royal
Exchange in the City, the Paris displays are not afraid of history. History
and the study of civilisation unlock an understanding and enjoyment of
architecture. The creators of the Paris exhibition understand this; they
begin their themed explanation of the city's growth and change by explaining
how the city acquired the shape it has today. From Philippe-Auguste's walls
and crypts to the rampant demolition and rebuildings of Baron Haussmann,
Paris has undergone sweeping changes. However, there is always evidence of
the grand vision, which is so rare in Britain.
The display in London helps to relate a number of significant architectural
developments in Paris to the overall plans and strategies for the city.
Visitors cannot but sense that the developers of Paris - both private and
public - are aware of the restraints and advantages of centralised planning.
The interminable peripherique, for instance, encircles Paris like a corset.
And it is interesting to observe that Paris's encounter with the Modern
movement was really a failure - the city remains visually of the 19th
century. The immense scale of much of what the Modern movement intended for
Paris destroyed the quartier and all the happy mixtures of activity that
make Paris work so well. The Centre Georges Pompidou, for all its
avant-garde attraction, also showed Parisians the crude insensitivity of
much modern design.
The more sensitive Parisians have always valued the density of their city
and its hidden courts and muddle of uses. The city needs both the grand
statement and the gradual renewal of the quartiers. There is a chance in
this exhibition to compare, for example, the Parc de Bercy (1990) with
Buttes Chaumont (1860); or the formality of La Grande Arche with the relaxed
abstractions of the Parc de la Villette.
The most intriguing period in Paris is, without a doubt, the 1980s and the
triumph of socialism, marked by the grand presidential projects and the new
urban policies of the city of Paris. In the 1970s, things were not quite so
clear; the redevelopment of Les Halles caused much controversy and the rise
of the post-modernism of Ricardo Bofill sparked off intense architectural
debate.
But President Mitterrand evidently knew exactly what he wanted. His projects
are the result of international competition and represent the new wave of
modernism.
The unknown Dane, Johan Otto van Spreckelsen, designed the great white
marble arch at La Defense. The equally unknown Bernard Tschumi, from New
York, won the commission for 'the park of the 21st century' at La Villette.
The president's wish to turn the entire palace of the Louvre into a
modernised museum was granted by the American architect I. M. Pei, who
provided the most potent new symbol in the city with his pyramid in the
Louvre courtyard. The ministry of finance now occupies the huge slab
overhanging the Seine designed by Chemetov and Huidobro, and the striking
new City of Music opened at La Villette last year, designed by Christian de
Portzamparc.
With the French elections almost upon us, what will become of the unfinished
projects if the socialist government falls? Will Dominique Perrault's
strange French National Library in the Tolbiac district ever house books in
its towers? Francis Soler's International Conference Centre on the Quai de
Branly, near the Eiffel Tower, proposes three great glass boxes of an
intensely minimalist design. Both these projects could well be casualties of
a change of government.
Whatever the political outcome of the next few weeks, Paris remains a city
where architecture really matters as a part of the national culture. That
just cannot be said of London, where the boom of the 1980s produced so
little of architectural merit and our national leaders seem intent upon the
removal of all sense of civic pride from the nation's capital.

According to World In Action (8.30 ITV) food poisoning in Britain is out of
control. Four years after the salmonella row, instances of food poisoning
have risen by a third. Yet this report claims that plans for compulsory
hygiene training for food handlers have been quietly dropped, various
products providing ideal breeding conditions for bugs have been exempted
from temperature controls, and ministers now want to dismantle some consumer
protection laws altogether. In the first of three programmes called Roots
Schmoots (9.00 C4), the wise-cracking novelist Howard Jacobson sets off for
Israel to find out what it means to have Jewish roots. We are told that the
three-part psychological thriller A Statement of Affairs (9.00 and 10.40
ITV) is about six reasonably contented 30-something people who eat, drink,
play badminton and go for long rambles along the seashore 'never suspecting
that their cosy world is about to fall apart'. In Panorama (9.30 BBC1), Jane
Corbin reports on Iran's efforts to acquire weapons of mass destruction:
biological, chemical and even nuclear.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Arts: La Favorite - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When so much about Welsh National Opera's new production of Donizetti's
Favorite is regrettable - singing, musical preparation, production - it may
seem perverse to start out on the matter of the Italian text that the
company has elected to sing. But since this seems to me symptomatic of the
central failure of artistic nerve that characterises this important revival,
I make no excuse for doing so.
La Favorite (1840) is a French grand opera, the second that Donizetti wrote
for Paris. It was regularly performed in that city until 1918, and
thereafter kept a toe-hold on the international repertory in Italian
translation; but, as every Donizettian knows who has ever compared the two
versions even briefly, the standard Italian Favorite text is a ghastly
botch-up of the original.
WNO's general administrator, Matthew Epstein, is well aware of the
overriding argument for performing the opera in its original language (as I
know from correspondence with him); its musical director and Favorite
conductor, Carlo Rizzi, admitted on the latest edition of Radio 3's Opera
News that he would have preferred to do Favorite in French. So what happened
to sway the company's two head-men against their own better judgment?
Enter at this point the Peter Moores Foundation, which has funded the
production, and which in the WNO Favorite programme offers the lame
rationale that 'the (opera's) surviving performance tradition is in Italy
and America, where it is always sung in Italian'. What this has to do with
the work's revival in Cardiff, and with a cast entirely made up of
anglophone singers all taking their roles for the first time, escapes me
completely.
If the Peter Moores Foundation had also stumped up sufficient cash to pay
for Italian stars (Cecilia Bartoli and Giuseppe Sabbatini, say, or even
Pavarotti) there would have been some sense in a WNO Italian-language
Favorite. At least the foundation has, for the occasion, also undertaken a
revision of the Italian version, which eradicates the notorious narrative
nonsenses of the standard Italian text (the process of transforming Favorite
into Favorita ran up against Italian censorship of the mid-19th century,
which turned a rigorous gaze on religion and historical personages in opera,
and which in this case resulted in garbled points of plot and character).
But this hardly settles the worrying basic question of sponsors exerting
influence on a national company's artistic policy. Does language really
matter? La Favorite is a noble, serious opera - about the struggle between
sacred and profane love undergone by the central figure, Fernand (tenor) -
in a consciously mastered French style.
In his works for Paris, Donizetti aimed high, and specifically: the forms
are large in scale, the orchestration is careful, and the vocal writing (bar
a few rum-ti-tum strettas) is severely simplified, achieving in solo and
duet a spacious singing style that was to have a powerful impact on Verdi.
The French words are clean-cut and cleanly meshed with the vocal line; in
Italian, and particularly in the very indifferent Italian on offer here, the
effect is constantly fuzzed up.
The larger point about the Cardiff Favorite performance is that a
little-known but significant opera is made to seem second-rate: stiffer,
less 'animally' alive in its musico-dramatic compound than Lucia and
Lucrezia Borgia, and cardboard-y in its characters and situations. In the
New Theatre on Friday the music was at once crudely shaped and loudly
belted. In the fascinating title-role - mistress of the king, Fernand's
guilty, unhappy lover - the Australian mezzo-soprano Bernadette Cullen gave
notice of a strong, well-schooled instrument but almost no notion of bel
canto style. Ditto the Fernand of Bonaventura Bottone, the ENO's
much-admired character tenor.
The remainder ranged from the just-acceptable to the mediocre. The
conductor, who failed to instil respect for dynamic markings in his singers,
secured fleet orchestral playing but little sense of larger movement. Rennie
Wright's production is 'modern' in a competently second-hand fashion:
stepped basic set, symbolic props, gauze, the all-too-familiar production
lingua franca of the 1970s. What a disappointment]
New Theatre, Cardiff, then on tour to eight cities, including two
performances in WNO's April residence at Covent Garden.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Arts: Ellen Taaffe Zwilich - Music in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The music of Ellen Taaffe Zwilich has made little impression outside the US,
but it is different at home, where her scores fly around the country like
shots in a pinball machine. Not a year passes without a new symphony,
concerto or mighty orchestral piece, always tidily made, practical,
uncomplicated, and sure to appeal to orchestral managements from Florida
(where she was born, in 1939) to Alaska.
On the very night of the first performance of her Third Symphony,
commissioned and played by the New York Philharmonic, Zwilich was also to be
heard in Phoenix and Minnesota. And this was only the first of three Zwilich
orchestral premieres planned for 1993.
Zwilich's skill is clear from the new symphony - as clear as the
cautiousness that may account for such success. She is cautious not to cause
expense (so no additions to the standard symphony orchestra), not to
trespass too much on rehearsal time, not to exceed the patience of the many
audiences she has the right to foresee (so three movements, and the whole
work over in 22 minutes) and not to go beyond, either, what the standard
repertory has taught those audiences to regard as the proper stuff of
symphonies (so strong themes, strong tonal centres, and a rhetoric of
combat).
What comes out of all this is music curiously close to that of another
20th-century symphonist who operated under a machinery of cramps and
constraints: Shostakovich.
Except for the steamrolling syncopation that shows the hand of a sometime
jazz trumpeter, almost nothing in the symphony would prevent one's hearing
it as a Soviet product of 50 years ago, by a composer taking her bearings
from Prokofiev (a few moments of spiky glamour reminiscent of Romeo and
Juliet) as well as from Shostakovich's symphonic procedures: the
emphatically stated keynotes, from which the melodies are often hopelessly
adrift and isolated; the insistence on germinal motifs (here especially the
very Shostakovich-like opening gambit of rising through a minor third by way
of a minor second); even the desolated triumphs.
For when this symphony finally returns to the F sharp of its opening, the
blazing triads are perched precariously in an unrooted treble, and dominated
by the over-bright, unsteady sound of high trumpets and vibraphone. This
moment needs a crack performance - and received one. Zwilich also expects
much from her violas, placed at the front right, from where they can balance
the first violins in voice and action, while the resort to traditional
sources of energy and argument inevitably brings the brass ensemble and
various woodwind soloists repeatedly to the fore.
Created for the musicians who were so confidently introducing it to the
world, the symphony was perhaps created, too, for Kurt Masur, though in the
event of his indisposition it was strongly urged by Jahja Ling, well used to
this composer's work.

<TEXT>
The stage is bare apart from an armchair illuminated by a spotlight. No, not
Mastermind; something much more challenging and disturbing. A complete
scruff wanders on, dressed in black, with his long hair divided by a balding
dome, like a mad professor. He sits down, picks up a microphone and is away.
'When we landed I forgot to take off my seat belt. I discovered I was
hauling the aircraft through the terminal.'
For well over an hour Steven Wright, perhaps the most admired of American
stand up comedians, fires off terse one liners, which are not exactly jokes,
more bizarre twists to accepted speech and reality. The delivery is
relentless; the face deadpan; the variation minimal. Yet Wright creates an
entirely credible world and lets slip an awful lot about himself and
American society.
Some of it is childish riddles: 'what do you put under coasters?'. Some of
it sixth form word play: 'I like to reminisce with people I don't know'.
Some of it is mildly amusing: 'Why are ballerinas always on tip toes? Why
not get taller women'. And some of it weird: 'You never know what you've got
til it's gone. I wanted to find out so I got rid of everything'.
This is the kind of act that can get very tedious. I smiled occasionally
while all around people were laughing hysterically. The skill is that purile
jokes - 'I bought a de-caffeinated coffee table' - are easily swallowed in
the incessant flow, and that there is a sinister undertow which keeps you
hooked. Wright talks a lot about his grandfather, with some typical
exchanges. 'Here's Dollars 5. Don't tell your mother I'm giving it to you.'
'It will cost more than that.'
The act enters the truly oddball when Wright picks up his guitar to sing
about a two-day-old baby girl who he has foretold will become a prostitute.
It is disturbingly funny. You realise that there is some method, some
underlying cohesion behind what seems to be random quips. The gap between
funny-ha-ha and funny-strange has been bridged.
Wright projects the image of the freewheeling American who hates cops and
regimentation. Yet there is minimal swearing; minimal political correctness;
minimal posturing. There are hints of Tom Lehrer and a bit of Garrison
Keiller. Sometimes his desire to turn the real world on its head - 'I like
to skate on the other side of the ice' - becomes formulaic but Wright is an
original, imaginative, rare talent. Like most comedians, you can tell
whether you are going to enjoy the act in the first minute. Wright was too
predictably smart-assed for my taste, but I can appreciate his appeal.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Carbon improves the taste of Thames
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN H&amp;G (AH&amp;G) has been awarded a Pounds 15m contract by Thames Water
for a 25 tonnes per day granular activated carbon (GAC) reactivation plant
to be built at Kempton Park, Surrey. The scope of work includes design,
procurement, construction and commissioning.
The design has already started and the plant is scheduled to come into
production early in 1995. GAC is being used increasingly by the water
industry to improve the quality of drinking water in order to conform to EC
directives. It is particularly effective at removing herbicides and
pesticides whilst also improving the taste and odour of water.
The energy efficiency of Anglian H&amp;G's reactivation process has been
optimised and raises internally all the steam required for the process. The
company is building an additional eight plants in the UK for the removal of
pesticides from water.
Anglian H&amp;G is a 50/50 joint venture between Anglian Water and H&amp;G Process
Contracting, part of the Jacobs Engineering Group.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Wastewater treatment plant in Macau
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A consortium led by WATER ENGINEERING (HK), part of the North West Water
Group, has signed a Pounds 15m contract to design, build and operate a
wastewater treatment plant in Macau, on the southern tip of China. Water
Engineering and its Portuguese partners, Teixeira Duarte and Soares Da Costa
overcame opposition from UK and French contractors with a compact and
efficient process design.
The plant, which will treat both domestic and industrial wastewater, wilt
take two years to construct, followed by an operation contract of three
years.
The plant, sited in a densely populated area, will be virtually enclosed and
screened from the public with access to parking facilities on top.
Considerable attention has been given to noise abatement and odour control.
Macau, a one-hour jetfoil trip from Hong Kong, is a Portuguese territory
destined to revert to Chinese rule at the end of 1999.

FT  08 MAR 93 / People: ICI split makes waves
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When a company like ICI, Britain's biggest manufacturer, splits itself in
two, the shock waves are felt well beyond the boardrooms of Ronnie Hampel's
slimmed down ICI and David Barnes' Zeneca.
It is easy to spot the winners at board level. Alan Pink (above left)
54-year-old chief executive of ICI's agrochemicals and seeds business, for
example, has gone on to the Zeneca board. He is the only one of the eight
chief executives of ICI's traditional core businesses to get a directorship
as a result of the demerger.
Rob Margetts, 46, who had been chief executive of ICI's Tioxide business
until six months ago, had already got a main board seat. But given that the
rest of his colleagues are in their late fifties, he would seem a
front-runner to take over from Ronnie Hampel who is little more than a year
away from ICI's normal retirement age of 62.
Three of ICI's four general managers are staying with the old firm - Victor
White, 56, group solicitor; Alan Spall, 48, finance; and Trevor Harrison,
53, planning. However, ICI personnel boss Hugh Donaldson, 51, joins Zeneca
as general manager of corporate resources, along with Norman Lyle, 45,
finance; and Graeme Musker, 40, secretary.
Michael Deeley, chairman of the separately quoted ICI Australia, keeps the
same job unlike most of ICI's other regional chairmen around the globe. ICI
Europe has been disbanded and its chairman, David Benyon, retired last
September. Ben Lochtenberg remains chairman of ICI America but is close to
retirement. Meanwhile, Keith Willard, president of ICI Canada, has been
appointed chairman of Zeneca in North America.
Paul Schindler, the Frenchman who was ICI's chairman of Asia Pacific, has
been made chairman of ICI (China) and Dr S Lui has been appointed chairman
of Zeneca in China. He takes on additional regional responsibilities from
August.
Finally, there are still some non-executive directorships to fill. Gill
Lewis (above right) 48, Nestles head of personnel, has just been appointed
to the Zeneca board, but the old ICI needs to recruit at least one more
non-executive director if it wants to maintain its traditional balance
between execs and non-execs.

FT  08 MAR 93 / People: Taylor Woodrow recast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow appears to have completed its senior management reshuffle
with the promotion of 46-year-old Brian Abrahams, currently responsible for
group trading activities and managing director of Greenham Trading, onto the
board. In turn, George Borwell, 66, chairman of Greenham Trading, will
retire from the board at the May agm.
When Colin Parsons took over as chairman of the big UK construction company
a year ago, he admitted that even he, as an operating director, sometimes
had difficulty in understanding the structure of the board, which at the
time was top-heavy and generally opaque. Since then, six directors have
left, and four new ones, including Abrahams, have been appointed.
A Taylor Woodrow man from the age of 16, when he joined as a junior in the
buying office, Abrahams has concentrated on the sales and marketing side. As
Borwell's protege, he pushed forward with the expansion of Greenham Trading,
which has a product range from contractors' tools to leisurewear and which
is one of the few businesses within the group that has continued to improve
its performance through the recession. Borwell, one of the doyens of
Greenham Trading, may be asked by the subsidiary board to become its
non-executive chairman. Taylor Woodrow reports its full year results on
March 30.

FT  08 MAR 93 / People: Co-heads for Salomon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Salomon Brothers has replaced Bill Strong, the head of international
investment banking who left unexpectedly in January, with two members of its
existing London senior management.
However, Charles McVeigh, 50, chairman of Salomon Brothers International,
and David Jarvis, 51, managing director and head of investment banking for
European financial institutions, assume responsibility solely for European
investment banking, whereas the rest of international will revert to Richard
Barrett and Leo Higdon who run investment banking worldwide from New York.
Strong had recently been promoted from head of the European side, but
Salomon says the newly created job had been tailored specifically for Strong
and that he had not been doing it long enough to establish the structure.
Jarvis adds that the co-head arrangement has become increasingly popular at
the bank - 'that way we can be in London and out with the client at the same
time'. He contends that Strong spent most of his time on 'internal
organisation. He was not a client man.' McVeigh and Jarvis have known each
other for 20 years and the latter says that it will not be a case of
dividing up the turf as they will be 'pretty much substitutable'.
McVeigh has been at Salomon since 1971, but Jarvis only joined six years
ago; he had been vice chairman and chief financial officer of Norwest
Corporation.

RESULTS DUE
HEADLINE pre-tax profits from BTR, the industrial conglomerate, should have
increased from Pounds 917m in 1991 to comfortably exceed Pounds 1bn last
year, although about Pounds 50m will come from profits on disposals.
Analysts at Thursday's meeting will be interested in what benefits have come
from the integration of Hawker Siddeley, taken over for Pounds 1.55bn at the
end of 1991, and current trading conditions in the US.
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is expected to
report annual pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1.55bn, up from Pounds
1.05bn, on Wednesday. Interest will centre on whether recent strong growth
in cigarette sales can be maintained, and how Eagle Star is recovering from
the heavy losses it has incurred on mortgage indemnity policies.
Full year results from RTZ, the world's largest mining company, due on
Thursday were foreshadowed last month when the group said there would be an
exceptional charge of Pounds 52m, compared to a Pounds 74m charge in 1991.
RTZ plans to adopt FRS 3. Net income, the line RTZ prefers to focus on, is
expected to rise from Pounds 308m to around Pounds 330m, after interim net
income was up from Pounds 154m to Pounds 158m. A maintained final is likely.
On Wednesday, Cadbury Schweppes is expected to announce pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 325m for the full year, up from Pounds 316.4m last time.
Trading profits in Britain and the US are thought to have finished the year
on a strong note.
TI, the specialist engineering group, is expected to produce pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 109m, up from Pounds 105.2m, and earings of 18p, when it
reports results for 1992 on Thursday.
The company has underperformed since its acquisition last year of Dowty,
which has suffered from the sharp deterioration in sentiment in the
aerospace industry.
Both GKN and T&amp;N, the motor components groups, saw profits bounce back in
the first half of last year as they reaped the benefits of cost-cutting and
overseas investment.
While full-year increases - to be announced on Wednesday - are expected to
top 30 per cent in both cases, questions will be raised about the state of
the German car market and other parts of the continent. As a counterweight,
the news should be good on US demand.
GKN is expected to report Pounds 125m, compared with Pounds 95m, while the
consensus for T&amp;N is Pounds 65m, against Pounds 49m. The former's dividend
should be roughly covered, but T&amp;N's will not be yet again.
The betting is that T&amp;N will nevertheless hold the payment.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Economics: US recovery concerns in the spotlight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economic recovery comes under the spotlight this week. Although last
week's non-farm payroll figures were much better than expected, there is a
feeling among economists that growth has slowed significantly since the
beginning of the year following the spurt of activity that accompanied
President Clinton's election.
Retail sales on Thursday are expected to reflect the deceleration of growth,
with the consensus forecast pointing towards only a modest increase last
month.
Economists will also be looking for signs that US inflation is under control
when the producer prices index is released on Thursday. Mr Stuart Parkinson,
international economist at Morgan Grenfell, believes there is too much
complacency about US inflation.
'People are assuming it is going to go away, but all the January inflation
figures were bad,' he says.
In the UK the focus will be on Thursday's Confederation of British Industry
quarterly distributive trades survey, expected to show a modest improvement
in consumer activity.
On Friday the savings ratio for the fourth quarter of last year will be
published. This is forecast to have fallen by almost a full percentage
point, reflecting lower interest rates.
Here are the rest of the week's economic events and statistics. The figures
in brackets, from MMS International, are the median of economists'
forecasts.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Management: An active 'no' to passive smoking - Health Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE home, in hotels and in aircraft, busy executives are exposed to it: a
human carcinogen so powerful it is classified along with such notorious
substances as arsenic, asbestos and benzene. After several decades of
intensive research the evidence is that environmental tobacco smoke (ETS),
or passive smoking as it is known, is a potential killer. Studies show it
causes heart disease, lung cancer and chronic respiratory illnesses.
In the US alone, 53,000 deaths are attributed to passive smoking every year,
making it the third highest cause of lifestyle-related deaths, after active
smoking and alcohol disease.
Most of the research on passive smoking since 1984 has demonst-rated the
causal relationship with fatal diseases - not least the review in 1986 by
the US Surgeon General and the National Academy of Sciences. Critics
(including those from the scientific community) often cited investigator and
other bias in attempts to discredit that work, but they have since been
confronted by more meticulous findings.
In 1991, an article published by the American Heart Association presented
data which revealed passive smoking lowers exercise capacity in both healthy
and coronary patients, a hallmark of impaired coronary circulation. Among
other immediate effects of passive smoking is the increased clumpiness or
stickiness, of clot-forming cells (platelets) in the blood. This plays an
important role in plaque and clot formation in coronary circulation. Passive
smoking also causes an oxygen supply/demand imbalance by increasing heart
rate and blood pressure and interfering with oxygen uptake by the red cells,
thereby reducing supply.
One researcher exposed healthy young women to pure air contaminated with
tobacco smoke while the subjects exercised on a treadmill. The results in
heart rate, blood pressure, exhaustion, perceived exertion and oxygen uptake
were similar to patients with heart disease.
Of the 4,000 or more substances identified as carcinogenic, atherogenic
(plaque forming), antigenic (allergy-forming) and mutagenic in tobacco
smoke, all those implicated in causing heart disease and lung cancer in
active smokers were found in ETS as well.
In an earlier Danish study of pregnant women - a study of the ultimate
passive smoker, the foetus - marked degenerative changes were noted in the
umbilical arteries of newborns of smoking women. The weight of the 'smoking
newborn' was, on average, nearly 500g less than their non-smoking
counterparts.
Children are better off with non-smoking parents: toddlers under the age of
one have significantly more bronchitis and other respiratory illness when
one or both parents smoke. As the child grows, exposure to passive smoking
in the home will lower lung capacity, predisposing the child to lung
illnesses later in life.
At the office, ETS levels are higher than in the home, due to the higher
density of smokers. Employers are getting the message and are justifiably
concerned with maintaining productivity and containing health care costs and
absenteeism. Insurance industry studies indicate smokers are more likely to
have higher health costs and more sick days than non-smokers.
A careful analysis of health claims and absentee data of passive smokers is
the critical next step.
The link between ETS and lung cancer was claimed in research from the
Harvard School of Public Health published last autumn in the Journal of the
American Medical Association. Those involved used clever innovations to
overcome investigator bias: autopsy lung specimens of several hundred
non-smokers aged over 35 who had died of non-cancerous and non-respiratory
causes (heart attack was the most common cause of death) and independent
interviews with survivors regarding occupational and smoking status. The
researchers concluded that pathologic (possibly pre-cancerous) changes were
higher in non-smoking women, married to a smoker.
Possibly the most incriminating link in the connection between ETS and
disease came via the tobacco industry. In a survey, published by the
American Journal of Public Health, of researchers who had received funds
from the tobacco industry's Council for Tobacco Research, 99 per cent of
respondents agreed smoking was addictive and 94 per cent believed passive
smoking was dangerous to health.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Management: Family fun at the AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Directors who dread annual meetings might learn something from NFC. The
transport and logistics group has a strong tradition of employee share
ownership. Following its 1982 sale by the UK government to a management-led
buyout, about 90 per cent of the company's 33,000 employees are
shareholders. As a result, the annual meeting has become as much a chance to
inform and motivate employees as to reappoint the auditors.
This year's event, held last Sunday in Nottingham and attended by more than
1,000 shareholders, had the air of a friendly reunion rather than a business
meeting.
Shareholders travelling by car or in a group by coach had their petrol costs
refunded. A creche was provided for young families and everyone was given a
packed lunch. At the end of the meeting, after rousing speeches and
congratulations to the management, shareholders were given questionnaires
asking how the annual event could be improved.
The meeting is also a forum to discuss future strategy. NFC's 1989
stock-market flotation, its diversification overseas and the appointment of
a shareholder director are all issues which have been aired in previous
years.
This time one shareholder highlighted the plight of a former NFC employee
fallen on hard times. James Watson, NFC's chairman, said that the NFC
charitable foundation would look into the case, and was rewarded with a long
round of applause.
Organising such large-scale events is not cheap; NFC spent about Pounds
65,000 on this year's meeting. For the future, Watson wants to attract even
more shareholders and believes other companies would benefit from following
NFC's lead.
'Our shareholders do feel they have a role in the business, and I would like
to see other companies going that way, however they are owned,' he said.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Management: Abbey kicks the habit - An increasing number of
employers are insisting on smoke-free workplaces
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On the first Wednesday morning of next month, Abbey National's 18,000 staff
in the UK will collect their ashtrays and ritually dispose of them. From
then on, not even senior managers in the privacy of their offices will be
allowed a furtive puff, for the banking group has decided on a smoking ban
for staff and visitors.
Abbey National is the latest of a number of large employers to outlaw or at
least restrict, smoking at work: an estimated 20 per cent of organisations
have smoking policies. For others considering the move, impetus came from
the recent case of the council worker in the north-west of England who won
Pounds 15,000 compensation for the alleged effects of passive smoking at
work.
Veronica Bland, a 36-year-old non-smoker, claimed her health suffered due to
colleagues smoking around her. Following the case, the Institute of
Personnel Management and anti-smoking groups such as Action on Smoking and
Health (Ash), were deluged by requests for advice from employers.
This same pattern of legal action, publicity and movement by employers, and
in some cases governments, towards restricting or banning smoking has been
seen in the US, Australia and elsewhere in Europe.
The out-of-court Bland settlement has no status as a legal precedent, but
many companies feel they no longer wish to risk the possibility of future
claims. Public opinion has been gradually turning in favour of smoke-free
working environments and to be a non-smoking organisation fits in with the
image many companies wish to project.
Individual addicts may intend to take advantage of No Smoking Day on March
10 to kick the habit, but for organisations wanting to give up smoking, the
cold-turkey approach is unlikely to be effective. Unless much preparatory
work has been done before Wednesday, a more realistic timetable might be to
aim for No Smoking Day 1994.
A year's lead-in was what Abbey National found it needed to introduce its
smoking ban. The group's experience provides other organisations with some
useful lessons on the practicalities involved.
Ted Murphy, Abbey National's group personnel manager, says the process has
been evolutionary, with smoking banned in areas visible to the public for
the past five years.
A working party was set up last March to review the options for developing a
smoking policy which would 'guarantee non-smokers the right to breathe
smoke-free air but, where possible, take account of the needs of those who
smoke'.
A questionnaire found that 80 per cent of staff were non-smokers - much the
same proportion as in the UK population as a whole. Of the smokers, only 20
per cent smoked in their working areas and, even among smokers, there was a
preference for some restrictions on where smoking should be allowed. Nearly
60 per cent of all respondents thought there should be separate rooms for
smoking. But Abbey National decided not to go the 'smoking dens' route,
mainly because it would have been impracticable in some locations,
particularly in very small branches.
There is no point having a designated smoking area if it is not separately
partitioned and ventilated - an exercise Abbey National's premises
department considered impossible or too expensive for some locations. Other
companies, particularly those in single buildings or occupying purpose-built
premises, have found it easier to accommodate separate smoking rest areas.
The principle of consistency has been applied throughout the hierarchy.
'If you're going to introduce a ban, it's simpler and cleaner to do it for
all parts of the organisation. If you draw lines based on status, you create
warps in the policy that, in the end, undermine it,' he says.
The final task was to help those employees wanting to take advantage of the
April deadline to give up smoking altogether. Katie Poate, Abbey National's
occupational health nursing officer, points out the company is not saying do
not smoke, 'but saying don't smoke at work'.
A three-month warning of the ban has enabled many smokers on the staff to
brace themselves for abstinence. Poate has given out a total of 450 packs
advising how to give up and interest-free loans of up to Pounds 200 are
available to those wanting to try hypnosis or nicotine patches.
For those who do not manage to kick the habit by the deadline, at least
there will be only three days to go until the weekend.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Defence factions fight for cash in 'review by stealth':
David White identifies the military equipment projects that are vulnerable
to the axe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FATE of military equipment projects worth several billion pounds will be
decided in the next few weeks.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, has to put the seal on new long-term
costings, a secretive exercise conducted every year by the Ministry of
Defence in conjunction with the Treasury. This year it has become, in the
words of one senior MoD official, 'a defence review by stealth'.
Government expenditure plans announced last November cut Pounds 1.05bn from
the defence budget over the next two financial years. Projections for
subsequent years will suffer commensurate reductions. In addition, the MoD
has to find Pounds 80m a year to pay for reinstating 3,000 of the army posts
it had hoped to cut following a decision by Mr Rifkind to reprieve the jobs
and cancel two regimental mergers.
Although some savings can be made in running costs, the bulk will come from
new equipment purchases. The future of thousands of private-sector jobs
hangs on the outcome - in companies such as British Aerospace, GEC-Marconi
and the Swan Hunter shipyard on Tyneside.
For the first time the costings for defence equipment are being extended to
cover the next 15 years instead of 10 years. The three services are battling
between themselves for weapons they will field well into the next century.
The following are the main projects considered vulnerable in the short-term
to being scaled down, postponed or abandoned: Helicopter carrier: The order
for a Pounds 170m ship to support Royal Marines operations was due this
October. But it is understood not to feature in the firm spending proposals
put to ministers. The future of Swan Hunter and its remaining workforce of
2,200 are staked on the project. It has been competing for the contract
against VSEL, the Cumbrian submarine builder, which would use a hull from
the Norwegian-owned Kvaerner Govan yard of Glasgow.
Swan Hunter, with no other naval shipbuilding work on its books beyond next
year, would also be prime contender to build two new large assault ships
worth about Pounds 200m each. Invitations to tender for the first of these
were in theory due this spring, but could now be delayed.
The navy is desperate to rescue these 'amphibious' ship projects and says
they are its top priority. Alternative cuts could include disposing of its
four new Upholder-class patrol submarines, which have cost the government
about Pounds 800m to build.
Type 23 frigates: Thirteen have been ordered so far from GEC's Yarrow
Shipbuilders and Swan Hunter. The last three-ship contract worth Pounds 400m
was placed with Yarrow early last year. The question now is when the next
batch will be ordered, and if it will be the last. Sandown class
minehunters: The navy has four of these from Vosper Thornycroft of
Southampton, with a fifth being completed. The MoD invited tenders for up to
seven more but let them lapse in 1991. The plan is due to be revived but
with fewer additional vessels.
Challenger tanks: The new Challenger 2 is due in service in 1995. Along with
the 140-tank order from Vickers the MoD had plans for upgrading the existing
fleet of about 400 Challenger 1s, all less than 10 years old, with the same
new Royal Ordnance gun. The army is willing to field fewer tanks but wants
them to be of Challenger 2 standard. A contract for new turrets or for 200
more Challenger 2s could be worth between Pounds 400m and Pounds 600m,
providing between three and six more years of work for Vickers' tank
assembly lines.
Anti-tank rockets: A four-nation project to develop a 'terminal guidance'
cluster weapon for multiple rocket launchers, known as MLRS 3, is 70 per
cent complete. The US, which has an alternative system of its own, is set to
pull out of the project later this year, however, and so is Germany.
Britain, after putting Pounds 100m into development, may abandon the venture
rather than go 50-50 with France. The French are committed to it and the
British army considers the system a battle-winner, but the Treasury regards
it as overlapping with planned air-launched weapons. At stake are 200
specialised jobs at Thorn EMI, the British partner in the industrial
consortium.
Army helicopters: Tenders have finally been invited for the purpose-built
attack helicopter the British army has long wanted - a contract potentially
worth up to Pounds 2bn. The army favours the McDonnell Douglas Apache, which
Westland is promoting. British Aerospace is backing a European alternative,
the new Franco-German Tiger, while GEC is proposing a cheaper option with a
version of the US Bell SuperCobra.
But the number purchased could be well below the 126 originally planned. The
1998 target for entry into service could also move. Tornado Mid-Life
Upgrade: Plans costing up to Pounds 1bn for re-equipping the RAF's Tornado
GR1 bombers could be scaled down to Pounds 300m. To be decided is how many
of about 100 operational aircraft to upgrade and to what extent. GEC-Marconi
is deeply involved. Original plans include replacing the aircraft's
terrain-following radar with a 'passive' system.
Troop-carrying helicopters: The MoD has had second thoughts about its plan
to buy the 25 utility variants of the EH101 naval helicopter made by
Westland and Italy's Agusta for the RAF. It now favours a competition and
says it is not ready to place an order, although Pounds 1.35bn of government
money has gone into developing the EH101. The RAF wants helicopters soon,
and stopgap solutions being mooted include second-hand French-made Super
Pumas.
Replacement for the Bloodhound missile: The MoD is officially 'evaluating'
bids in a Pounds 500m-plus contest to replace the Bloodhound air-defence
weapon, already withdrawn from service, with a new medium-range
surface-to-air missile (MSAM). BAe and Raytheon of the US are proposing a
mix of Patriot missiles and an extra purchase of Rapier 2000 systems, while
GEC is backing a Franco-Italian project, SAMP-T. Hughes of the US is
promoting a ground-launched version of the Amraam air-to-air missile which
the RAF is buying.
A decision has already been delayed. The MoD has to decide whether to press
ahead, go for a limited interim programme or to abandon the project and wait
for a system better suited to countering the threat from ballistic missiles.
The Treasury has demanded that a balance be struck in air defence between
missiles and purchases of the new four-nation Eurofighter 2000 aircraft. The
Eurofighter project is considered secure, although the issue of how to set
about a revised programme is far from settled with the German government.
The UK, having initially indicated a requirement for 250 Eurofighters, still
has to work out how many it really wants. The aircraft is clearly the RAF's
overriding priority.
It is not certain how and when decisions on all these options will be
divulged. But there is sure to be bad news for at least some contractors.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Sterling's slide 'has boosted steel'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAKERS OF steelwork for construction have seen international invitations to
bid for work rise at least 15-fold since sterling left the exchange rate
mechanism last autumn.
Most of the invitations have come from continental Europe, a survey of order
inquiries received by the 12 largest UK constructional steel producers
shows.
Prices of UK steel quoted in US dollars and other foreign currencies have
fallen by up to a fifth since September. Manufacturers say that in some
cases British steel is being re-exported to third countries.
Mr Robin Booth, managing director of Booth Industries, said some Continental
companies working on overseas contracts had been trying to make jobs more
profitable by purchasing cheaper UK steel.
The study, by the British Constructional Steelwork Association, shows that
international invitations to tender and requests for price quotations
received by the 12 largest companies involved more than 76,000 tonnes of
steel in January and February.
Until last autumn international inquiries had been averaging only about
3,000 tonnes every two months, said the association, which measures
inquiries for jobs involving 750 tonnes or more. Construction of a
medium-sized supermarket would normally in-volve about 200 tonnes.
Mr Derek Tordoff, the association's director, said that since September
companies had received inquiries involving 155,000 tonnes of steel compared
with just 39,000 tonnes in the previous six months. More than two-thirds of
these inquiries had come from continental Europe.
British Steel said: 'It is too early to have an effect on our sales, given
that it normally takes several months to translate inquiries into orders,
but the trend is very welcome.'
Some orders have already been placed. Mr Joe Locke, managing director of
Watson Steel, said since devaluation his company had won four contracts
worth 'a couple of million pounds' in Germany.
Tetbury Structures in Gloucestershire said it had won a Pounds 750,000 job
in Gibraltar because it had been able to undercut the labour costs of
competing Dutch fabricators.
A rise in export orders would provide a welcome respite for British
fabricators, whose domestic output has fallen almost 40 per cent since 1989.
Mr Tordoff said that since then more than 100 UK steel contractors had
ceased trading or gone into receivership.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Chemical dreams turn to ashes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK chemical industry is proud of its trade record. Over the past decade
chemical manufacturers have produced consistent trade-balance surpluses.
But for how much longer? The balance in chemicals is already deteriorating
and the long-term outlook is bleak. Mr Ronnie Hampel, chief operating
officer of ICI, said: 'It just does not make sense manufacturing bulk
chemicals in the UK any more.'
In 1980 exports of chemicals, excluding pharmaceuticals, exceeded imports by
55 per cent. Last year the surplus was only about 20 per cent.
The decisive moment came in the early 1980s. The worldwide recession meant
that growth rates in plastics slowed rapidly, leading to heavy
overproduction and steep losses. Europe's petrochemicals and plastics
capacity was cut by about 25 per cent, and British companies took more than
their share of the pain.
ICI closed two ethylene processing plants, Shell closed another and Monsanto
closed its low-density polyethylene plant at Fawley, Hampshire.
For each, the closures made sense. But when the economy picked up in the mid
1980s there was a surge in imports because domestic production could not
meet demand.
It was worst in the PVC market. The construction boom sucked in imports of
products such as PVC pipes and windows to meet demand during the mid and
late 1980s. Export tonnage of PVC halved between 1980 and 1991 while imports
trebled.
Although some new capacity came on stream import penetration continued
during the late 1980s, only to be halted by the recession.
Since then British chemical companies have endured cuts in jobs and
capacity. ICI, for example, was cutting staff before German chemical groups
admitted that the European economy was slowing. The group has cut its staff
by 21,000 since 1990 and more redundancies have been announced.
Traditionally, UK-based chemical groups try to export their way out of
trouble. Mr Ian Fyfe, a director of the UK subsidiary of the BASF chemical
group of Germany, estimated that the industry's exports as a proportion of
sales rose from 35 per cent in 1977 to 48 per cent in 1985.
British companies, however, do not need to service their customers from a UK
base. Most are building plants near their new customers in the US,
continental Europe or in Asia. ICI, for example, authorised capital
expenditure of Pounds 3.5bn in the UK between 1981 and 1991, but spent
Pounds 7.6bn outside Britain in the same period.
In the short-term, the UK industry's surplus is expected to improve.
According to the Chemical Industries Association, the UK trade body, the
devaluation of sterling will also help the trade balance to increase over
the next 12 months.
The long-term future is far bleaker. If the industry is to halt or even slow
its decline it must restructure - moving away from commodity products and
into niches.
If a success is not made of such products the trade surplus could turn
negative, sending the industry down the same path as the shipbuilding and
textile sectors.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL shops attract significant trade in spite of the spread of superstores
and out-of-town developments, according to a report published today by
Verdict Research, the retail market research consultants.
The report says spending in neighbourhood shops was Pounds 36bn in 1992  - a
quarter of all retail sales. But the number of local shops has fallen by
11,000 to 102,000 in the last 10 years.
Neighbourhood shops averaged yearly sales per square foot of Pounds 440,
above the Pounds 260 average for out-of-town and high street stores.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Investors hope for move on PSBR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EIGHTY per cent of fund managers expect the chancellor to announce in his
March 16 Budget that purchases of gilts by banks and building societies will
count towards financing of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement, a survey
for stockbrokers Smith New Court shows, Richard Gourlay writes.
The survey suggests there could be short-term disappointment in the gilts
market if there was no such move to underfunding, or relaxation of the
so-called full funding rule.
Sixteen per cent of the respondents did not expect a move to underfunding in
the Gallup survey of 96 institutions which handle Pounds 618bn of funds.
The investors are divided on what PSBR the chancellor is likely to forecast
for the financial year beginning in April, with 17 per cent expecting a
deficit of less than Pounds 40bn; 35 per cent Pounds 40bn to 45bn; 30 per
cent Pounds 45bn to 50bn; and 10 per cent Pounds 50bn or more.
On the equity side, the institutions demonstrated a growing preference for
UK, and even more strongly, continental European equities. A small majority
of investors turned sellers of the US market.
The investors believed the retail prices index would be rising by 3.3 per
cent by the end of this year and 4.1 per cent a year later. These figures
are down from 3.5 per cent and 4.3 per cent in the February survey.
Immediately after the UK left the exchange rate mechanism last September the
survey showed investors expected end-1993 inflation of 4.0 per cent.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Studies confirm confidence is up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPORT of a surge in business confidence in the first two months of this
year, recorded by the Institute of Directors in its latest survey, is
reinforced by other surveys published today which detect an improvement in
business and consumer confidence but warn that it could be shortlived.
The institute found that 51 per cent of the 305 directors questioned were
more optimistic about the outlook for the economy than they were six months
ago, compared with 38 per cent in December and 10 per cent in October.
The only region where the level of confidence fell was the Midlands, where
48 per cent were more optimistic compared with 50 per cent in December.
But fewer directors report that their company has been investing - 49 per
cent in February compared with 53 per cent in December and 52 per cent in
October. For more than a third of directors insufficient demand remains the
main concern.
A survey published today by PA Cambridge Economic Consultants shows consumer
confidence is recovering slowly. The quarterly survey's index of confidence
has seen the first rise since June 1992 to 75.2, up from 72.8 in December.
Of the 1,000 people questioned, 12.4 per cent expect their financial
position to improve in the next three months compared with 9.3 per cent in
December - 20.8 per cent expect it to get worse, but that is down from 25.9
per cent in the last survey.
A new index of activity in consumer industries launched this week by NTC,
the research group, also suggests that the consumer sector is recovering.
NTC reports that the index has been rising sharply for the past five months
because of increases in retail sales, TV advertising, share prices and
recent interest rate cuts.
A more cautious note is sounded in the survey published today by the Finance
&amp; Leasing Association. It reports that 64 per cent of members have seen a
rise in confidence in consumer lending, compared with 8 per cent in October,
but nearly two thirds of members report no change in business lending and 'a
mood of caution' about the future.
Infolink, the consumer credit information group, warned: 'Consumer
confidence may well falter in the run-up to the Budget on March 16.'

FT  08 MAR 93 / Overheated debate of economic niceties produces trade in
insults: The argument which has split the Treasury's panel of seven wise men
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THICK cloud of recrimination, hurt pride and embarrassment has settled
over the UK economics profession after the angry blast by Prof Tim Congdon
directed at the other six members of the government's new panel of economic
advisers.
Prof Congdon says in an open letter to the six, to be published this week,
that he has been 'dismayed' by the work of the group - set up only three
months ago - on the grounds of what he says is his fellow members' lack of
understanding of the basics of economics.
The substance of Prof Congdon's accusations - that the other members of the
panel, with much of the economics establishment, do not account adequately
for the money supply in their economic analysis - does not surprise those
who know him. Prof Congdon, a staunch monetarist who is economic adviser at
Gerrard &amp; National, the City discount house, feels passionately about his
subject. He combines a high regard for his own intellectual capabilities
with a fondness for lecturing his fellow economists.
These traits have won Prof Congdon respect but have also brought him a fair
number of detractors. 'He's an arrogant so-and-so,' was one of the comments
from members of the economics community at the weekend.
In the professor's favour is that his forecasting record since the mid-1980s
has been significantly better than that of many other economists. He
correctly foresaw both the inflationary boom of 1986-88 and the seriousness
and length of the recession which followed soon afterwards.
In terms of forecasting he has performed far better than the teams of
economists at the UK's two biggest and best-known academic establishments in
the discipline - the National Institute of Economic and Social Research and
the London Business School.
They are represented on the Treasury panel by the institute's director, Mr
Andrew Britton, and the LBS's head of forecasting, Prof David Currie.
Prof Congdon is also a member of the generally respected Liverpool Six group
of monetarist economists, which correctly argued from early 1991 that the
recessionary forces in Britain would ultimately compel the country to leave
the European exchange rate mechanism.
What has surprised many about Prof Congdon's latest tirade - which he showed
to the FT on Friday - is the force of the invective in his 12-page letter
and the fact that he included in his sweeping criticisms his fellow
monetarist, Prof Patrick Minford of Liverpool University - who is another
member of the Treasury panel.
The letter demonstrates not only Prof Congdon's lack of regard for restraint
in conducting economic arguments, but the gulf between him and Prof Minford
 -another member of the Liverpool Six - when it comes to considering the
technical role of money in the economy.
In his letter, to be published in Gerrard &amp; National's monthly economic
review, Prof Congdon criticises the Liverpool academic on the detailed
points of monetarism and concludes that he has no 'means of analysing the
effects on the economy of a change in the quantity of money'.
Prof Minford retorted at the weekend that Prof Congdon was 'plain wrong' and
'ignorant'. He added: 'The whole thing is embarrassing and a bit pathetic. I
am afraid Prof Congdon does not understand modern economics and doesn't
listen to other people's views.
Prof Gordon Pepper, of the City University Business School, a further member
of the Liverpool Six, said Prof Congdon's letter was 'incredibly
irritating'.
Prof Pepper said: 'For him to attack the neo-Keynsian economics
establishment in the UK and its lack of success in economic analysis is fair
enough. But going about this in this rude way, and by including Prof Minford
in his sweeping comments, undermines his case.'
Two of the other members of the panel - Mr Andrew Sentance of the
Confederation of British Industry and Prof Wynne Godley of Cambridge
University - both expressed their displeasure at Prof Congdon's remarks. Mr
Britton - who is a particular target of Prof Congdon's cutting comments -
said he did not want to comment until he had read the full text of the
letter. 'I might not want to comment then either,' he added.
Yesterday Prof Congdon found at least one wholehearted ally among the other
ranks of monetarist economists. Mr Paul Turnbull, chief UK economist at
stockbrokers Smith New Court and a former colleague of Prof Congdon, said:
'In my view the vast majority of UK economists do not place enough emphasis
on money and credit, an oversight which has led to dramatic failures in
forecasting by mainstream economists in recent years. I sympathise entirely
with Prof Congdon's views.'

FT  08 MAR 93 / CBI expects pay rises below 2.5%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIT LABOUR costs in British manufacturing industry are expected to continue
falling over the next few months, the Confederation of British Industry
says.
It expects productivity to increase by up to 4 per cent and pay settlements
to fall below 2.5 per cent.
Figures from the CBI pay databank for the three months to the end of January
show average manufacturing pay settlements at 2.5 per cent and
service-sector settlements averaging 2.8 per cent.
It is the first time that the databank, which covers more than 1,400
companies, has recorded settlements below 3 per cent across the whole
economy.
The CBI also notes that one in three companies, in both manufacturing and
the service sector, has introduced a pay freeze of up to one year since last
August.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of the CBI, said: 'What matters now is
that we keep up the progress. If we can do that we will be better placed
than when we came out of the last recession to avoid inflation and to seize
competitive advantages in the marketplace.'
The Engineering Employers Federation recently recorded similar figures for
settlements and pay freezes.
However, Industrial Relations Services, the independent pay analyst,
recorded slightly higher average pay settlements for the quarter to the end
of January of 3.1 per cent, and recorded pay freezes covering a fifth of
settlements.
The continuing uncertainty about the medium-term movement of pay settlements
and average earnings is, however, underlined by the pay assumptions of the
government actuary built into the latest report on benefit up-rating.
Government economists have assumed a very wide range for the increase in
average earnings for 1993-94 with an increase of 3 per cent at the bottom
end and 7 per cent at the top end.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Motor industry joins fast lane: In the last of our series on
manufacturing, FT writers find one sector's prospects are improving but in
another they are growing bleaker
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
IF THERE is one sector in British manufacturing where there are strong hopes
for revival it is the motor industry. The UK is set to be the
fastest-growing centre for car production in Europe during the 1990s and the
industry is expected to move into trade surplus in the second half of the
1990s.
Mr Colin Hope, president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders
and chairman of T&amp;N, the UK automotive components suppliers, said: 'The
prospects are for a doubling of production over the next five years.'
Professor Garel Rhys, professor of motor industry economics at Cardiff
Business School, said UK car production could jump to between 2.5m and 2.8m
units by the year 2000 from 1.3m last year, with exports rising to between
1.2m and 1.5m from 600,000 last year. He predicted a surplus in the overall
trade balance in automotive products in 1996.
The motor industry is a good example of the decline of manufacturing in
post-war Britain. In the 1970s labour relations were notorious, product
quality was often abysmal, management was inadequate and inward-looking, and
the attempt to create a national champion in the form of British Leyland was
bungled.
The motor industry trade balance plunged into the red in 1982 and economic
growth in the second half of the 1980s sucked in more imports, while the
industry lacked a strong export base to penetrate foreign markets. The
deficit swelled to a record Pounds 6.6bn in 1989 - 28 per cent of the UK
visible trade deficit.
Mr William Ebbert, chairman of Vauxhall, the UK subsidiary of General Motors
of the US, said: 'The UK automotive industry has laid firm foundations for a
strong future, even though we've still got a long way to go. Britain really
does have a great chance to play a leading role in the future of the
European motor industry.' By 2000 the UK could have moved 'from fifth to
maybe third place in the European industry,' he said.
The biggest single force behind the recovery is investment - totalling more
than Pounds 2.1bn - by three leading Japanese carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and
Honda, although Mr Hope insists that existing vehicle makers and component
suppliers are 'playing a full part' in the recovery.
Mr Jacques Calvet, the protectionist chairman of Peugeot, the French
carmaker, sees the UK as 'a Japanese aircraft carrier' leading the assault
by Japanese producers on the traditional carmakers in Europe.
By the end of the decade the car industry in Britain, measured by output,
will be one-third owned by Japanese makers, one-third owned by US
manufacturers and one-third owned by European producers.
The UK industry built 1.16m vehicles in 1982 with 315,000 people, including
metal parts suppliers. By 1991 output had risen to 1.45m vehicles with a
workforce of 216,000, Mr Ebbert says, while motor vehicle exports rose from
327,000 in 1982 to nearly 690,000 in 1991.
Mr Ebbert said: 'On most significant criteria our industry today is highly
competitive in Europe. The British industry is now delivering quality
products reliably, and in European terms, at low costs.' He believed,
however, the European motor industry had to 'redouble efforts to lift
performance to world-class levels.'
The arrival of the Japanese car producers is helping to rejuvenate the
automotive components sector. Parts and accessories account for about 45 per
cent of UK exports of motor industry products. Japanese component suppliers
such as Nippondenso, Calsonic and Sumitomo are producing in the UK, and
European suppliers such as Valeo, Robert Bosch and Magneti Marelli have also
established a significant presence here.
Prof Rhys said that the UK motor industry, with its long-term competitive
improvements reinforced by the devaluation of sterling since it left the
European exchange rate mechanism in September, was 'well set to survive in
the more competitive environment leading up to the new millennium'.
The industry that was 'the laughing stock of the 1970s' was experiencing
'renewal and growth'.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Heseltine warns miners over pit disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, yesterday told
miners that pit closures would be 'hard to avoid' if they went ahead with a
campaign of industrial disruption.
His warning followed a ballot of the National Union of Mineworkers which
supported by 60 per cent to 40 per cent the call by Mr Arthur Scargill, the
NUM president, for a 24-hour strike followed by a 'rolling programme of
action' in protest at threatened pit closures and job cuts.
The NUM vote was 12,913 in favour of action and 8,465 against, although the
60 per cent turnout was low for an NUM ballot.
The vote is expected to strengthen the hand of cabinet ministers who are
resisting any significant retreat from plans announced by the government in
October to shut 31 pits and shed 30,000 jobs.
The long-delayed white paper on the future of the coal industry is expected
to come after next week's Budget.
Some ministers believe the NUM ballot will silence the group of Conservative
MPs who aligned themselves with the miners' cause against pit closures. Mr
Winston Churchill, one of the group, said the result had pulled the rug from
under the potential Tory rebels.
Mr Heseltine said: 'The reason we have a problem today is that very large
numbers of customers have chosen to change their source of energy. An
important reason for this was industrial relations in the pits. This sort of
decision seems to confirm to customers for coal that they were right to move
away from reliance on it.'
There is a danger of a widening conflict in Britain's coalfields. Last night
the leaders of Nacods, the 4,000-strong pit deputies union, said they were
confident their members had also voted in support of disruption. The result
of their ballot will be known by Wednesday.
The National Union of Democratic Mineworkers, strong in the Nottinghamshire
coalfield, is not holding a strike ballot.
If the colliery deputies have voted in support of protest action their union
and the NUM are likely to delay any move for a fortnight. They are awaiting
the outcome of the ballot of 63,000 members in the RMT rail union, who are
being asked to join in industrial disruption because of British Rail's
failure to guarantee no compulsory redundancies in any rundown of the
network.
Mr Peter McNestry, Nacods general secretary, said the NUM and his union
would work to keep public opinion on their side. They would be developing
new tactics in their campaign to save pits and not resort to the aggressive
mass picketing seen during the 1984-1985 miners' strike.
Plans are also being prepared for a day of action across Europe by miners in
protest at pit closures.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Government warned on Budget strategy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday warned the government not to threaten economic recovery by
increasing taxes in next week's Budget, calling instead for a temporary
holiday from National Insurance contributions for employers who increased
their workforces.
Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, said Mr Norman Lamont should
introduce a grants scheme for small businesses to enable them to expand and
invest. It could be funded by closing a range of tax loopholes. Labour
calculated that 400,000 jobs were at risk over the rest of the year.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Labour query on Crescent oil group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, intends to ask in
parliament this week whether Crescent Petroleum, a private oil company based
in Abu Dhabi, has been breaching government sanctions against Iraq, Robert
Taylor writes.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control in Washington and a number of US senate
committees are investigating the activities of Crescent Petroleum in the
United States. Mr Cook wants to know whether Mr Michael Heseltine's
department is inquiring into the company's affairs in Britain.
The owner of Crescent Petroleum, Mr Hamid Jaffar, has a brother, Mr Jaffar
Jaffar, who was the head of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme and a deputy
minister in the Iraqi defence ministry. Just before the outbreak of the Gulf
war in 1991 Crescent Petroleum was planning a downstream petroleum venture
with the Iraqi government.

FT  08 MAR 93 / 53,000 council jobs 'lost last year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 53,000 local government jobs were lost last year, statistics prepared
by the Local Authority Joint Staffing Watch show. However, pay-cuts-for-jobs
deals could slow the shedding of staff next year.
Agreements to save jobs, such as that between unions and Sheffield City
Council in which unions traded a pay cut for jobs, are likely to be limited
this year because most councils have set their budgets and made their plans
for 1993-94.
But the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities said
yesterday that more councils and unions might move in that direction in
1993-94.
In Sheffield nearly 20,000 employees voted to take a pay cut in exchange for
shorter working hours to stop the city council making 1,400 of them
redundant.
According to the staffing watch statistics local authorities lost more than
31,000 jobs in 1991.
Mr Stephen Bubb, secretary of the AMA, said that last year's job losses
confirmed his worst fears. 'We believe that up to 100,000 more local
government jobs will be lost in the next 18 months,' he said.
The Local Government Management Board, the employers' organisation, said it
did not believe that Sheffield would set a precedent. 'There were unique
circumstances in Sheffield,' it said.
It is understood that a majority of councils have had informal talks with
unions over pay freezes, but no agreements have been reached.
According to the Local Government Chronicle the government's desired 1.5 per
cent pay limit for public-sector workers is forcing councils to renegotiate
contracts with employees who have index-linked pay.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Tories still dogged by tensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR believes his government has reached a watershed. He may be
right.
In retrospect, this spring may be judged to have marked the start of
economic recovery and the beginning of the end of the Tory civil war over
Maastricht.
But if it does prove so, political historians are more likely to give the
credit not to the government but to a more favourable turn of events.
The Conservative party central council meeting in Harrogate at the weekend
was meant to be the occasion at which the government recaptured its
confidence. Instead it revealed again the tensions and frustrations which
still beset the Tory party.
A procession of cabinet ministers trooped to the platform to decry
Conservative opponents of the Maastricht treaty and to talk up the recent
signs of economic confidence.
Mr Major wound up with an upbeat and not unconvincing assessment of the
government's prospects once the recession and the row over Europe are put
behind it. The constituency activists who make up the party's central
council gave him a warm and sympathetic reception.
But if hope and exhortation were visible in abundance - and were duly
applauded by an audience searching for anything to cheer - there was less
evidence of a fresh political strategy to accompany them.
The frustration was never far below the surface. Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, summed up the mood in the cabinet when he decried the
'trench warfare' over Maastricht that was sapping the government's
authority.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary, was typically blunt. Enough is enough
he declared, before likening the arguments of Tory rebels to those of the
obscure religious sect under siege by police in Waco, Texas.
The sentiments were echoed by speaker after speaker. It appeared that the
tactic was to drive a wedge between the Tory Euro-sceptics and their local
party associations.
Mr Hurd is furious at the way the legislation is being held up by the
rebels' filibustering and has been urging a tougher line by the party whips.
He made it clear that the treaty had to be ratified before parliament broke
for the summer.
But by the time Mr Major came to speak threats had been replaced by
exhortation. The prime minister was not prepared to risk a permanent breach
with the rebels by wielding the big stick. Instead he appealed for unity.
The odds are that the whips will increase the pressure on the rebels and
seek to force the pace of the legislation. But the confused message from
Harrogate will not have helped.
Last night most of the Euro-sceptics were unmoved. The government today
faces the possibility of its first defeat on the legislation in the Commons.
The weekend message on the economy was similarly blurred. Mr Major thinks
the recession is over. He has made the point several times in private
conversations with colleagues. He is unapologetic about his efforts to talk
up confidence.
But past false dawns have persuaded him to temper his optimism in any public
statements. Mr Major talks of a 'turning point'. He will not state flatly
that he believes recovery is under way. But his caution undermines his own
case - it reinforces the impression that the government has not restored its
grip.
So too does cabinet-level gossip about the prospects for a summer reshuffle
which might see Mr Norman Lamont switched from the Treasury.
Close associates of the prime minister insist he has not made up his mind
one way or the other. His senior cabinet colleagues are less reticent in
their speculation. The case for a new chancellor is being made not only by
aspirants for the job but also by senior Tory party advisers.
For his part Mr Lamont is determined that the Budget will make his case for
staying on until the wider shake-up pencilled in for next year. The
uncertainty - likely to be prolonged until the Maastricht bill passes its
final Commons hurdle - is damaging the government.
Mr Major and his colleagues made a credible case in Harrogate that the worst
is be over, that recovery will gradually restore their authority and that
Maastricht will in the end be ratified. They did much less to demonstrate
that the government has regained charge of its own destiny.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Clark candidate for Newbury by-election
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN Clark, the maverick former minister at the centre of the row over
Matrix Churchill, yesterday said he wants to be the Conservative candidate
in the Newbury by-election.
His decision to join hundreds of other aspiring Tories on the candidates'
list for Newbury follows the announcement that he would not be prosecuted
for alleged inconsistencies in his evidence over arms sales to Iraq
negotiated by three executives of the machine tools company.
Mr Clark retired from parliament at the last election after representing
Plymouth Sutton for 18 years. Yesterday he said the 'drug' of politics had
proved too strong.
Senior Conservatives said that his age - he is 64 - and the continuing
controversy over Matrix Churchill would tell strongly against his candidacy
but the choice would rest with local party officials.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Small businesses hope for green light against red tape: An
issue that is seen as more important than the weight of the tax burden -
Spring Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SMALL manufacturing companies' investment scheme, an improved Business
Expansion Scheme and an increase in the funds available for the Loan
Guarantee Scheme are the sort of measures that business lobbyists would like
to see in the Budget on March 16 to help small businesses recover from the
recession.
All three measures were introduced last time British industry was struggling
out of a recession. In the Budget presented by Sir Geoffrey Howe in March
1983 they formed part of what the FT called 'probably a record number of new
measures' to help small businesses.
Ten years on little appears to have changed. The small-business lobbyists
are pressing hard for something to replace the BES - which is due to expire
at the end of this year - and for a revitalisation of the Loan Guarantee
Scheme to make it more attractive to the banks and more affordable to
business.
Manufacturing businesses do not rank a specific mention in this year's
Budget submissions but they would derive the most benefit if the chancellor
responded to pleas for a more generous regime of first-year investment
allowances. In 1983 engineering was considered an important enough element
of the manufacturing sector to rank for special treatment.
Hopes that something will be done for the makers of goods rather than the
providers of services received a boost on Thursday with the strong
endorsement given to the manufacturing sector by Mr John Major.
Exporters may also have taken encouragement from the prime minister's
evident wish to promote exports. Last week, shortly after returing from a
successful trade mission to Saudi Arabia, Mr Major offered to take more
businessmen with him on foreign trips if it helped to open doors. More
generous government support for export credit insurance is one item on the
lobbyists' shopping list.
Mr Major also gave a broad hint in the Commons that small businesses would
be among the main beneficiaries of any tax concessions.
A study of ministerial speeches in the weeks leading up to the Budget is
probably not the most effective way of divining the chancellor's intentions.
The Treasury's purdah rules are unlikely to permit even the prime minister
to signal the government's intentions in any detail.
But inevitably the business lobbyists are attempting to read the runes of
government policy as best they can. They are trying to sketch in those
elements of their detailed Budget presentations which are most likely to
survive the Treasury's red pencil.
The constraints imposed by a ballooning public sector borrowing requirement
will put a brake on the more costly measures which the small-business
lobbyists have been seeking - such as cuts in the uniform business rate.
Calls for a reduction in capital gains tax, which at parity with top-rate
income tax is seen as a brake on enterprise, may also go unheeded. Mr Ian
Peters, deputy director of smaller-companies policy at the CBI, said: 'The
key is that they will be looking for issues which don't cost very much.'
This squeeze on government revenues could persuade the chancellor to take
the low-cost route to pleasing small businesses by cutting red tape.
Administering the tax and social security system represents a considerable
burden on businesses in terms of management time.
Only last month the government announced a wide-ranging review of the
bureaucratic burden on business, but it could take early action in the
Budget to simplify the present tax system. Mr Richard Brown, policy director
at the British Chambers of Commerce, said merging tax and national insurance
would provide relief for small companies.
The complexities of the VAT system and the harshness of the penalties
imposed for errors have again featured prominently in the small-business
lobbyists' submissions this year. The serious misdeclaration penalty,
applied indiscriminately for simple mistakes or deliberate fraud, is still
under review - after being cut from 20 per cent to 15 per cent last year -
and a further easing is hoped for.
The Federation of Small Businesses has suggested the elimination of VAT on
transactions between VAT-registered businesses. This would cut
administration costs, minimise the problem of bad debts and reduce the risk
of incurring penalties without affecting the VAT yield to the Treasury. VAT
is, after all, meant to be a tax on final consumption, not on business, the
lobbyists say.
Apparently minor adjustments to VAT administration can have quite
significant benefits for small companies. Immediate relief from charging VAT
on bad debts would help small businesses, given the present high rates of
business failure. At present businesses can claim relief only after one
year. Raising the VAT threshold from Pounds 36,600 could take businesses out
of the VAT net, but a rise above the rate of inflation would need to be
cleared with Brussels.
In spite of the similarity between the small-companies' Budget submissions
of 1993 and 1983, much has changed in the intervening decade. The important
role played by small businesses in creating jobs, broadening consumer choice
and stimulating innovation is now more widely recognised.
But this has not prevented governments from devising tax and social security
systems of excessive complexity. The annual Budget round gives the
small-business lobbyist the chance to remind civil servants that simplicity
and ease of implementation are, if anything, more important than the weight
of the burden imposed.

white-collar than in the past.
Mr Stephen Bubb, secretary of the AMA, said that last year's job losses

A number of councils, including Bracknell Forest Borough Council, introduced
index linked pay for some groups of workers affected by compulsory
competitive tendering.

ANGOLAN government sources yesterday denied a claim by the rebel movement
Unita to have captured the key central city of Huambo, Reuter reports from
Luanda.
'The fighting is continuing,' said one source who denied Unita's claim to
have captured the provincial governor's palace, the last main redoubt of
government troops in Huambo, on Saturday.
Other officials said Unita had made several previous claims to complete
victory in Huambo, the main focus of renewed fighting between government and
Unita forces over the past two months.
The official news agency Angop carried an armed forces statement on Saturday
night which said intense fighting was continuing in the city of half a
million people.
But this was issued three hours before Vorgan, the rebel radio station, said
Unita forces controlled Huambo.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BEHIND the slightly shabby facade of Kasumigaseki, Tokyo's civil service
area and the government heart, a fight is under way to reshape the most
sensitive aspect of Japan's most important international relationship - its
trade policy towards the US.
Japan's approach to the Clinton administration when Premier Kiichi Miyazawa
visits Washington in mid-April will be determined by the outcome of the
struggle between Japan's bureaucratic big battalions. The fight to refashion
policy towards the US has pitted the Ministry of International Trade and
Industry against the Foreign Ministry, and, equally significantly, the
Finance Ministry and the Bank of Japan.
They all agree on many issues, and welcome Mr Clinton's plan to cut the
budget deficit. But they are at odds over some vital aspects of trade
policy. Miti wants policy towards the US to be guided by a new overall
approach to trade issues, a shift from a trade policy based on special
considerations for foreign demands to a rule-oriented approach.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama, Miti vice-minister for international affairs, believes
the US administration could improve trade relations in the long run. An
attack on the US federal budget deficit should help cut the US trade
deficit, while the administration's industrial policy should help raise US
industry's competitiveness.
He stresses it is too early to judge the new administration's trade policy,
which so far seems cautious. The anti-dumping decision against steel imports
was inherited from the Bush administration and the new administration has
refrained from raising import tariffs on mini-vans. But Tokyo is still
braced for US demands for Japan to open its market.
Miti favours stimulating the Japanese economy to cut the surplus by creating
more demand for imports. It says it will resist moves to open up sectors of
Japanese industry such as cars or computers, to a specified level of
imports. But this approach is running into opposition from two different
quarters.
First, the Foreign Ministry argues that a 'rule-governed' policy which
attempts to settle trade disputes through formal procedures will sound
evasive in Washington. A ministry official said: 'You have to address some
issues directly. Everyone is fed up with the Structural Impediments
Initiative talks. We have to look for a new mechanism. We have not yet
reached consensus on what that should be.' One option considered by the
Foreign Ministry are two parallel sets of bilateral talks, one for
macroeconomic issues, the other for micro-issues such as measures to open
Japanese markets to imports.
Trade friction with the US has a strategic significance for the Foreign
Ministry. The end of the cold war has removed the main rationale for the
US-Japan security alliance. As a result, the alliance is more vulnerable to
being disrupted by trade frictions.
Mr Katsunari Suzuki, in charge of policy planning at the Foreign Ministry,
said: 'If the imbalance continues, then US public support for the defence of
Japan will erode. It is most important we work with the Clinton
administration to strengthen the US economy because then US public opinion
will be more magnanimous about supporting Japan in times of need.'
Second, Miti faces equally powerful opposition from the Finance Ministry and
the Bank of Japan. Their worry is economic. They fear an attempt to reduce
the trade surplus by stimulating the domestic economy's demand for imports
will provoke a renewed bout of inflation in two or three years. Financial
authorities believe the bubble economy of the end of 1980s was set off by
economic policy in 1987, when the government introduced a Y6,000bn emergency
spending package, partly in response to foreign pressure, when the economy
was already out of recession.
Mr Kosuke Yamamoto, who was in charge of industrial policy at Miti at that
time, explains that Miti's ability to mobilise business and political
pressure forced the Finance Ministry to double the size of the package from
the initial Y3,000bn.
The financial authorities are determined not to make the same mistake again.
Mr Yasushi Mieno, the Bank of Japan's governor, commented: 'An imminent need
exists to put the economy on a sustainable growth path to get rid of the
cyclical component of the surplus. Higher growth will to some extent reduce
the surplus, but a significant amount will remain. If that is dealt with by
macroeconomic policy, that could be very inflationary.'
The implication is that the structural component of the surplus needs to be
dealt with by microeconomic measures targeted at specific industries. Mr
Mieno says: 'Market opening can be very useful'. When Mr Miyazawa lands in
Washington, he should be singing a tune his officials have agreed. But that
will be the outcome of a painful battle yet to peak in Tokyo.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Tokyo plans new trade policy approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN plans to adopt a new approach to trade policy with the US, based on
the application of formal rules and procedures for settling trade disputes
rather than political negotiation, according to Japan's top trade
negotiator.
Mr Noboru Hatakeyama said Japan wanted a rule-governed approach, to
eliminate emotion and politics in settling trade disputes. 'We have given a
lot of consideration to US industry; we accepted their request to come up
with an import goal for semi-conductors. From now on, we want a trade policy
governed by rules set by Gatt. That will eliminate the emotional aspects of
the game and help to prevent trade frictions spilling over to affect other
aspects of our relations.'
Gatt would play a central role in setting the standards for the policy, Mr
Hatakeyama added. Trade pacts would have to be Gatt-compatible and more
trade complaints would be referred to Gatt for adjudication, he indicated.
The policy had been developing since the decision last year to appeal to
Gatt over the EC's anti-dumping action against Japanese electronics, Mr
Hatakeyama went on. Japan had a strong track record of upholding Gatt
accords.
It had taken the lead on reducing tariffs on manufactured goods and its
average import tariff was just 2.5 per cent, against 5.6 per cent for the EC
and 5.5 per cent for the US. Japan had last year been repeatedly rebuffed by
the EC and the US when it had tried to contribute to Gatt talks to reduce
agricultural subsidies. Japan would take a more active approach to Gatt's
stalled Uruguay Round.
'Many people said we were hiding behind the US and the EC, but whenever we
tried to negotiate they asked us to wait until they were ready. We were too
ready to accept that rejection. Next time we will be more disciplined and
make sure we come first.'

FT  08 MAR 93 / Good news being prophesied by the bond markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE THE 1990s to be a decade of low inflation? That is what bond markets
seem to be saying. If they are right, what might it mean for the recovery?
The timing of the bond market rally has closely followed that of the
business cycle. It started in the US, where redemption yields on 10-year
government bonds have fallen by 3 1/2 percentage points since March 1989
(see chart). It moved to the UK, where yields on 10-year gilts have fallen
by more than 5 percentage points from their peak in April 1990. Finally, it
hit Japan and Germany: Japanese yields have fallen by almost 4 percentage
points since September 1990, while German ones have fallen by 2 1/2 points
over the same period.
The US and the UK have not enjoyed bond yields as low as these since the
early 1970s. In better managed economies, current yields are less
remarkable. German long-term rates of interest were 5.7 per cent in March
1978 and below current levels for part of the late 1980s. Similarly,
Japanese long-term interest rates were lower, if briefly, in April and May
1987. Furthermore, current rates must be set in their historical context.
Long-term yields are still well above what had been normal in either the US
or the UK before the inflationary 1960s and 1970s.
Bond yields reflect the long-term real rate of interest, expected inflation
and taxation. The latter can be ignored, however, since so many holders of
long-term bonds avoid (or evade) tax.
The long-term ex ante real rate of interest is determined by supply of, and
demand for, investible funds. But the real rate of interest cannot be
ascertained from yields on conventional bonds, since inflation expectations
are unknown.
Here British index-linked gilts can help. Under certain strong assumptions -
perfect global capital market integration and the absence of credit and real
exchange-rate risks - the interest rate on British index-linked gilts would
also represent the world's long-term real interest rate. Although those
assumptions do not hold, the information provided in the chart is helpful.
It shows that real interest rates can vary substantially over time. It also
shows that British real interest rates have fallen by more than one
percentage point over the past 12 months, presumably because of the
recession-induced decline in investment opportunities and the real
depreciation of sterling (which has lowered the exchange rate risk on
sterling-denominated assets).
Nevertheless, the British data suggest that lower inflation expectations
were absolutely more important than lower real rates of interest in causing
the decline in nominal bond yields. For a tax-exempt British institution,
expected inflation, as measured by the gap between the yields on
conventional and index-linked gilts, has fallen by nearly 4 1/2 percentage
points since early 1990.
If 3 1/2 per cent were, indeed, the global risk-free real rate of interest,
expected inflation would now be around 3 per cent in Germany, 2 1/2 per cent
in the US and  1/2 per cent in Japan. These low figures suggest a high
degree of confidence in the prospect for inflation. Furthermore, the recent
strength of stock markets - except for the Japanese market, which also
remains rather expensive - does not suggest that fears of a slump are the
main reason for that optimism over inflation.
One good reason for optimism about real economic performance is the low bond
yields themselves. Regardless of the real interest rate, high nominal
interest rates increase the cash-flow risks attendant on borrowing for the
purchase of long-term assets. If they are sustained, low long-term interest
rates can help ensure healthy long-term investment throughout the upswing.
But for that to happen, inflation expectations need not only to be but to
remain subdued. The confidence of all those investors who believe that low
inflation will survive the recovery is admirable. But, particularly for
those buying huge quantities of gilts from the UK government, it also
represents the triumph of hope over painful experience.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Second Korean minister set to go

<TEXT>
THE expected departure of a second minister from the 10-day-old cabinet of
South Korean President Kim Young-sam highlights the issue of corruption that
his new administration has promised to fight.
Ms Park Yang-sil, minister of health and social affairs and one of three
women in the cabinet, is expected to be dismissed today for allegedly
engaging in illegal property speculation. At the weekend, Mr Park Hee-tae,
justice minister, resigned for allegedly taking advantage of a
foreign-citizen loophole to get his US-born daughter admitted to Seoul's
highly-competitive Ehwa Woman's University.
The newly-appointed mayor of Seoul, a presidential appointee, was sacked
last week for allegedly illegally developing land in a 'green zone'
surrounding the city. Mr Kim has made clear he is determined to root out the
corruption that is pervasive in Korean society. But the sackings are
embarrassing, since the cabinet was billed as strongly reformist, consisting
of political outsiders who would challenge the status quo.
The charges against the cabinet ministers are emotive ones in South Korea.
There is public resentment against those who made fortunes from the property
boom of the late 1980s. Ms Park is alleged to have avoided government curbs
on property acquisitions by making the purchases using the name of her
children. She denies wrong-doing.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Kanemaru quizzed on 'tax evasion'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Shin Kanemaru, the disgraced former kingmaker of Japan's ruling Liberal
Democratic party, spent yesterday being questioned by prosecutors in Tokyo's
criminal detention centre, after being arrested on Saturday for alleged tax
evasion running to several hundred million yen.
Mr Kanemaru's arrest came hours after the Diet's lower house passed the 1993
budget, paving the way for the government to draw up further measures to
stimulate the flagging economy. The opposition parties had been delaying the
budget with calls for an income tax cut and further investigation of the
Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin scandal, which led to Mr Kanemaru's resignation last
year.
Some political analysts believe the prosecutors' decision to arrest Mr
Kanemaru may reflect the government's decision that further action against
him was necessary to still the opposition's campaign on the Sagawa scandal.
The Tokyo prosecutor's office, widely criticised for failing to interview Mr
Kanemaru in person last year over the scandal, also wants to restore its
battered public reputation.
Mr Kanemaru, who was head of the then-dominant faction within the LDP,
resigned last October after being fined Y200,000 (Pounds 1,169), following
his admission that he received an illegal political donation of Y500m from
the scandal-tainted Tokyo Sagawa Kyubin trucking company.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, was arrested over allegations that he concealed income of
up to Y800m between 1987 and 1989. Mr Masahisa Haibara, his private
secretary, is alleged to have concealed income of about Y400m between 1987
and 1991.
Leading LDP politicians, including Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
said they were dumbfounded by the arrest, which probably owes much to the
influence of the recently-appointed justice minister, Mr Masaharu Gotoda, a
proponent of political reform.
The political impact of the arrest will not be clear for a few days. It may
work to the government's benefit by laying to rest the Sagawa scandal, or
could once again highlight that financial irregularities are often the
foundations for power in Japanese politics.
The passage through the parliament's lower house of the Y72,350bn budget for
1993 means it will automatically become law within 30 days. The focus will
immediately shift to the government's plans for a further special spending
package to stimulate the economy. In August last year, the government
announced a Y10,700bn package of public works spending and measures to
support the stock market.
Leading business organisations, as well as the opposition parties, are
pressing for an income tax cut of Y4,000bn-Y5,000bn. But the LDP and the
powerful Finance Ministry are as yet opposed, because although a tax cut may
generate only a limited rise in consumption, it would require higher
government borrowing through issuance of deficit financing bonds.
Ministries and lobby groups are likely to put forward a plethora of schemes
in the next few weeks.
The Ministry of International Trade and Industry is drawing up plans for an
investment programme in advanced telecommunications networks and computer
equipment for schools and universities, to help the ailing electronics
industry. The Finance Ministry opposes this plan, which officials regard as
a direct subsidy to the industry.
Finance Ministry officials want the package to focus on public works
spending, housing tax credits and investment incentives for small and medium
businesses.

for at least 90 days a controversial study of the US anti-dumping and
countervailing duty regime and its impact on the American economy.
Mr Don Newquist, head of the agency which determines whether US companies
have been injured by alleged dumping and subsidies, has written to Mr Mickey
Kantor, US trade representative, asking him to confirm that the new
administration of President Bill Clinton wants the study to go ahead. He
claims that budget pressures, and questions from a congressman, have
prompted his call for a review.
Mr Jim Kolbe, a Republican congressman, has written to Mr Kantor to protest
against Mr Newquist's 'unilateral decision' to delay the study. He has
complained that Mr Newquist has misconstrued comments he had made to justify
delaying the investigation. He claims that Mr Newquist's letter does not
properly reflect the fact that he was highly supportive of it.
Mrs Carla Hills, the former trade representative under President George
Bush, waited until five days before she left office to ask the ITC to mount
the two-year study of the effects of 'unfair trade' cases on the consumers,
producers and workers.
Mrs Hills' timing remains a mystery. Just eight months before leaving
office, she specifically omitted the issues of dumping and other 'unfair
trade' from a study on the economic effects of American import restraints.
She is likely to have been well aware that a study into the effects of
dumping would be potentially embarrassing for President Clinton, pitching
powerful domestic industries such as cars, steel and textiles (which are
traditionally strong Democratic supporters) against US exporters and
consumers, all of whom have to pay higher prices because of such duties.
Many foreign companies and trade lawyers in Washington see the laws as
inherently biased against foreign defendants.
Mr Newquist has said he will take up the investigation if he does not hear
from Mr Kantor in 90 days.
Otherwise, he will follow the trade representative's recommendation.
He said the commission was facing personnel and budget reductions in
conjunction with the administration's attack on the budget deficit. Mr
Kantor, as one of the few officials who can order ITC investigations, was
asked to comment on the requested study 'in light of our resources. . . and
the other priorities you may have'.
Among those 'other priorities' are studies on trade in mackerel and durum
wheat, and recent investigations of magnetic switches, the peas and lentil
industries, and the trade in meat and live cattle with Canada.
The political implications of the study will not be lost on Mr Kantor, who
was the president's campaign chairman and frequently expressed sympathy with
'the people standing on the unemployment line' who have no interest in
'abstract lectures about the value of free trade and exports'.
Mr Kantor's recent comments suggest he regards the US dumping and
countervailing duty regime as providing 'a fair hearing process'. He said
recently: 'Forty nations of the world have dumping laws; I would say the US
process, both in terms of fair hearing and transparency, is probably as good
as or better than any process in the world.'

FT  08 MAR 93 / Banks' Bombay exposure raised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE total problem exposure of banks involved in the Bombay securities market
scandal is Rs40.2bn (Pounds 873.9m), or Rs4.8bn larger than originally
estimated, according to a report published at the weekend by the Reserve
Bank of India, the central bank.
The reserve bank, in its fourth report on the affair, raised its estimate
after months of investigations of the books of banks and stockbrokers
involved in the scandal.
The affair, which erupted last April, has prompted the resignation of a
cabinet minister, the arrest of about 20 people and heavy losses for some
banks, including Standard Chartered Bank of the UK.
The banks lost money mainly through extending credit to brokers in the
fast-growing and lightly-supervised inter-bank securities market. The four
foreign banks most active in the market were Citibank and Bank of America of
the US, ANZ Grindlays and Standard Chartered.
The report published at the weekend confirmed previous findings that banks
knowingly evaded reserve bank guidelines by giving brokers wide freedom to
invest borrowed funds in the stock market - both for banks' own accounts and
for clients.
The report concentrates on the roles of Standard Chartered and ANZ
Grindlays, having singled out the two American-owned banks for detailed
treatment in an earlier study. The investigators say Standard Chartered
surrendered discretionary control of funds to Mr Hiten Dalal, a broker, in
return for guaranteed returns on their money. The report says the
arrangements were made in full knowledge of senior management at Standard
Chartered.
'Standard Chartered has been carrying on its securities transactions in
total contravention of reserve bank guidelines and in violation of the norms
of prudent banking,' says the reserve bank, in one of the strongest
criticisms contained in the report.
Standard Chartered has previously admitted breaking guidelines and violating
prudential norms. It has put the blame principally on relatively junior
executives and on inadequate supervision by their immediate superiors.
Grindlays for its part was closely involved with Mr Harshad Mehta, another
important Bombay broker nick-named Big Bull for his perpetual optimism.
The report says the extent of Grindlay's connection with Mr Mehta was
camouflaged by the fact that payments from other banks were deposited
directly into Mr Mehta's accounts at Grindlays without specific instructions
to do so. This created the impression that the transactions involved banks
only, when in fact they involved Mr Mehta.
All four foreign banks named in reserve bank reports have moved senior
managers out of India since the scandal erupted.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Failure on IMF deal puts Kenya's reform at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOLD STEPS by the Kenyan government to liberalise its economy were in
jeopardy at the weekend after International Monetary Fund officials left the
country without agreeing a provisional deal that would pave the way to the
restoration of foreign aid.
The IMF departure came at the end of three weeks marked by the most radical
reform of the economy ever carried out by the embattled government of
President Daniel arap Moi.
A positive verdict from the IMF was seen as crucial for Kenya to regain
desperately needed quick-disbursing foreign aid worth about Dollars 40m
(Pounds 28m) a month which was suspended in September 1991 because of the
government's long record of unfulfilled promises, mismanagement and
corruption.
The government has said that without the urgent resumption of aid the
reforms, including foreign exchange liberalisation, reduction of price
controls and resumption of measures to free the farm sector, will be
unsustainable.
However both donors and the IMF, who welcomed the measures, have warned
further steps would have to be taken urgently to curb monetary liquidity and
avoid the mounting risk of massive currency depreciation, hyper-inflation
and possible social unrest among the urban poor.
The government has said that donors are asking them to plunge into
uncertainty without promising an injection of foreign exchange to sustain
the reforms.
On the eve of the IMF visit three weeks ago the government removed exchange
controls, leaving the exchange rate to be set for commercial transactions by
the banking sector. The central bank said it would still operate a foreign
exchange window at a lower official rate for government imports, official
debt service and publicly guaranteed debts.
The government also announced the complete liberalisation of the wheat trade
from the producer to the consumer and a relaxation of price controls on
other commodities.
'More has been achieved in the past three weeks than in the previous three
years,' said one western donor.
Since the liberalisation the shilling has depreciated more than 50 per cent
against sterling. Money supply growth exceeded 35 per cent last year, mostly
in the last six months, as a result of corrupt commodity and foreign
exchange trading activities and the injection of money for election campaign
finance. Inflation in the past four months is estimated at 40 to 60 per
cent.

WHITE and black politicians in South Africa have agreed to resume
constitutional negotiations within a month.
Agreement was reached, however, only after a preparatory conference in
Johannesburg at the weekend agreed to postpone consideration of all
potentially contentious issues: a sub-committee must resolve them before the
talks can begin. Problems remain over such vital issues as how the talks
should be structured, who should attend, who should chair them and what they
should be called.
Several delegates stressed that the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party, which
often proved obstructive in a previous round of multi-party talks,
demonstrated what one ANC delegate called an 'unusual degree of
conciliation'.
They said an atmosphere of goodwill and co-operation characterised the
closed-door sessions of the two-day talks, which brought together
traditional enemies such as the white supremacist Conservative party and the
black radical Pan Africanist Congress for the first time.
Discussion of constitutional issues, such as whether South Africa should be
a federal or unitary state, was also deferred. Delegates to the conference,
attended by some 26 political parties from right and left, said the aim was
to avoid confrontation in the weekend plenary, and merely to set a deadline
(April 5) before which talks must resume.
The talks provided evidence of the gap between the 26 parties on
constitutional issues, such as the form of the future state, and on the the
process of constitution-making.

AFGHANISTAN'S rival mujahideen leaders shook hands and embraced in a rare
show of goodwill yesterday, as leaders of seven factions and Mr Burhanuddin
Rabbani, the president, signed an agreement to end factional fighting.
Mr Nawaz Sharif, Pakistan's prime minister, played host and acted as the
principal negotiator during the six-day talks.
The agreement brought Afghanistan's two leading foes together. President
Rabbani and his chief rival, Mr Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, shook hands and sat
down for face-to-face talks, their first such meeting in more than six
months.
Under the agreement, Mr Rabbani will remain president for 18 months while Mr
Hekmatyar will assume office as prime minister. However, the leaders were
unable to decide the most divisive issue of allocating cabinet posts, and
agreed only to form a new cabinet in 15 days.
The future of Afghanistan's powerful defence minister, Mr Ahmed Shah Masood,
and that of the powerful Uzbek general, Rashid Dostum, also remains
uncertain.
Mr Hekmatyar has been demanding that Mr Masood should be removed from the
Defence Ministry, because both he and President Rabbani belong to the same
party.
In the agreement, there were no clear provisions for including Gen Dostum in
the government or for any high offices to be given to his party, the
Junbish-i-milee, to gain his support.
At least 5,000 people have been reported injured and hundreds killed in
rocket attacks on the capital, Kabul, launched by Mr Hekmatyar's men, since
the beginning of the year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S influence in Nato is rapidly declining, its credibility is being
questioned, and it no longer deserves special treatment now that the cold
war is over, General Klaus Naumann, the country's chief of staff, said
yesterday, writes Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
His comments follow debate among the country's political parties about how
far the Bundeswehr, or armed forces, should become involved in activities
outside Nato territory, as well as playing a role in UN peace-keeping and
conciliation operations.
They coincide with remarks by Mr Hans Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign
minister, who yesterday told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper that the
country's soldiers had the right to know about cuts in personnel as well as
future Bundeswehr activities.
Bundeswehr operations are restricted by the 1949 constitution, which limits
German troops to operations on Nato territory. But Gen Naumann said it was
time for the country to 'share risks'.
'You can almost see German influence in the alliance crumbling before your
eyes. We Germans must realise that the basis of any alliance is the
willingness to share risks. We must no longer be allowed to play a special
role,' he said.
This is not Gen Naumann's first public criticism of German dithering over a
defence policy. In January he said Nato was disappointed with Bonn's
decision not to participate in air surveillance operations if the UN imposed
a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Hercegovina.

<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS officials are today due to hold negotiations with Serb
commanders on the evacuation of the wounded from Konjevic Polje, a Moslem
enclave in eastern Bosnia-Hercegovina, and the despatch of emergency relief
to nearby Srebrenica, where conditions are reported to be worse.
General Philippe Morillon, commander of UN forces in Bosnia, is expected to
meet General Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb commander, and General Sefer
Halilovic, Bosnian army chief, in Sarajevo to try to broker a ceasefire in
eastern Bosnia and send UN military observers into the region.
While UN officials press for the evacuation, Serb commanders are trying to
link any agreement with an exchange of Serbs from Moslem-held regions of
Bosnia.
Amid reports of dire conditions in Srebrenica, six US aircraft early
yesterday parachuted 38 tonnes of food and medical supplies over the
enclave. Srebrenica's population has doubled to 60,000 as refugees seek
sanctuary in the Bosnian government stronghold.
A doctor of the World Health Organisation who hiked through the hills to
Srebrenica on Saturday said about 2,000 people were reported to be sick and
wounded in the town in the hills above the River Drina.
Dr Simon Mardel estimated that 200 seriously wounded people needed urgent
evacuation and that an additional 9,000 women, elderly and children were
seeking safe passage.
'This is the worst situation brought to my attention since I came to former
Yugoslavia in July,' Sir Donald Acheson, WHO special representative, said
after hearing Dr Mardel's report.
Meanwhile, Gen Morillon, after crossing Serb lines on Saturday on a
fact-finding mission to Cerska, said there did not appear to be evidence of
atrocities. Ham radio operators last week said hundreds of Moslems had been
killed when Serb forces seized the town.
'We have seen evidence where most of the houses were shelled or burned but I
did not see any evidence of massacres,' Gen Morillon said.
However, the commander of Bosnian government forces said yesterday that Gen
Morillon had arrived too late and had been duped by Serbs. He accused the
general of making an 'illegal tour' of east Bosnia.
Relief workers said at least 175 wounded and sick needed urgent evacuation
from Konjevic Polje. 'People have had amputations, and are suffering from
wounds they have received from shrapnel, bullets and mines,' said Ms Lyndal
Sachs, of the Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Local leaders say the hamlet's population has swollen to 35,000 people, half
of whom are refugees from Cerska. Konjevic Polje was the target of US
air-drops for two nights last week.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary-general, said on American TV
yesterday that UN member nations must be prepared to send troops against
Serbian forces if they failed to agree a negotiated peace, Reuter reports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin said yesterday he would propose to Russia's Congress
of People's Deputies on Wednesday a new law to divide powers between the
executive and legislative branch. But if his law was rejected, he said in a
television debate, he was ready to hold a referendum, which some of his
parliamentary opponents have accused him of fearing.
Mr Yeltsin did not say how the law differed from a draft agreement between
the executive and legislature which he has already proposed and which was
rejected by the standing parliament on Friday. But the advantage of a law
would be that it would require a simple majority instead of the two-thirds
vote needed for constitutional change.
But the president evaded questions over whether he might resort to some kind
of authoritarian solution, hinted at last week, if the Congress or full
parliament also voted to cancel the referendum it approved in December.
Mr Yeltsin said the country's constitutional crisis affected everyone even
though it might not seem to. 'Say I issue a decree and all of a sudden the
local council in Altai says it won't be carried out. What kind of authority
is that?'
But he stressed he wanted to avoid confrontation with parliament and reach
agreement if possible.
He also gave some more details on the three 'short and clear' questions he
proposed to ask if a referendum were held. The first would ask Russians to
vote for private land ownership: he suggested this would be so popular that
he did not 'even need to comment on this'.
The second question would seek permission to reduce the current system of
standing and full parliaments to one bicameral assembly 'which would talk
little but achieve a lot'.
Finally, he wanted a special constituent assembly, rather than the present
deputies, to adopt a new constitution. He said a constituent assembly would
attract 'new people, who would not be prevented by vested interests from
adopting a new constitution which would be in Russia's long-term interest'.

FT  08 MAR 93 / US aid plan aims to speed reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is working on new aid measures to get the process of economic reform
in Russia back on track and at the same time bolster the political prospects
of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
President Bill Clinton has promised to offer specific 'innovative solutions'
at his meeting with Mr Yeltsin in Vancouver next month, and officials are
working on plans for loan guarantees to help build housing for redundant
Russian troops, as well as an enterprise fund to aid entrepreneurs.
At the same time, US farmers are pressing for an urgent settlement to
Russia's debt problems, which have halted sales of their grain under a
government-guaranteed credit programme.
Russia is more than Dollars 400m (Pounds 280m) in arrears in payments on
these US grain credits, although it made a token Dollars 15m payment last
week. A full solution, however, depends on reaching a broader agreement to
reschedule all of Russia's outstanding debts to the Paris Club of creditor
countries.
This rescheduling has been held up, in part because of a dispute between
Russia and Ukraine over how to divide responsibility for debts incurred by
the former Soviet Union. Negotiations have been stalled since an offer from
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations in December to reschedule over
Dollars 15bn of past official debt, cutting Russia's debt service
obligations this year from Dollars 12bn to Dollars 2.75bn.
The Clinton administration is considering setting up a direct food aid
programme to replace the grain credits, and members of Congress from farm
states have come up with a number of other imaginative solutions, such as
the proposal from Mr Dan Glickman of Kansas to swap Russia's nuclear weapons
for forgiveness of its entire debt to the US.
Mr Clinton's outline budget proposals would increase aid to Russia and the
other former Soviet republics to Dollars 700m from Dollars 417m this year,
while at the same time cutting or freezing most other US foreign aid
programmes.
Although the State Department last week disavowed the prediction of Mr
Richard Armitage, who had been in charge of US aid to the former Soviet
republics, that Mr Yeltsin would not last long in power, many US officials
privately consider Mr Yeltsin's prospects of survival extremely fragile.

THE European Commission is trying to push member states into active support
for US air-drops of humanitarian aid to besieged Moslem enclaves in eastern
Bosnia-Hercegovina. Mr Hans van den Broek, EC commissioner responsible for
external political relations, told the Financial Times that support could
extend to making available EC supplies of food and medicine for delivery by
the US.
The proposal is expected to be discussed today at a meeting of EC foreign
ministers in Brussels, along with the question of whether to tighten
sanctions on Serbia.
When the US canvassed Nato allies at the end of last month for support for
the air-drop, EC states expressed lukewarm support for Washington's
initiative and withheld practical contributions, preferring instead to
continue with their efforts to deliver aid through land convoys under UN
auspices.
The EC has been stung by criticism that it has not done enough to relieve
suffering in the former Yugoslavia, and that its role as the largest
supplier of humanitarian aid has been overshadowed by the high-profile US
air-drops.
Mr Manuel Marin, EC commissioner in charge of humanitarian aid, unveiled
last week a new Ecu60m (Pounds 49.6m) package for the former Yugoslavia -
one quarter of the total aid the Community expects it will have to provide
this year. The EC has already delivered Ecu290m in aid since the onset of
the crisis.
Mr Van den Broek's call for a closer association with the US air-drops is
based on the conviction that the EC must co-ordinate its efforts with the US
 -and Russia - if more permanent solutions to the conflict are to be found.
Mr Van den Broek said that, in the event of a peace plan being agreed, the
EC, the US and Russia should be involved in making such a political
settlement stick 'with all accompanying military elements'.
Senior EC diplomats said last week that if the peace plan drawn up by Lord
Owen and Mr Cyrus Vance under EC/UN auspices collapsed, there would be a
progressive tightening of sanctions against Serbia.
But if a deal is struck, the focus will move rapidly to the issue of
enforcement.
The diplomats make clear there is a growing likelihood that Nato will take
the leading role in policing a deal. One ambassador said: 'The idea of
involvement by the alliance in policing (any agreement) is rising steeply
up.'
The same diplomat also noted that France was playing an active role in
Nato's defence planning committee for former Yugoslavia, 'a very striking
change which is extremely encouraging'.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Bosnian peace talks in balance after suspension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL peace talks to end the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina continue to
hang in the balance after being suspended until the end of this week in New
York.
Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem president, said before leaving for
Sarajevo progress had been made in the negotiations on a map dividing the
country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces. But diplomatic observers remain
sceptical about the Moslems' or Serbs' political will to conclude an
agreement at this stage.
'There's no question that the fighting that has been going on (in eastern
Bosnia) has made the talks much more difficult,' Mr Cyrus Vance, one of the
two international mediators, said.
Though Mr Izetbegovic said he would be returning to the US later in the week
'with the intention of moving the discussions forward to a successful
conclusion', there are indications that his colleagues in the Bosnian
government are much less ready to compromise.
Bosnia's ambassador to the United Nations, Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, who is
reported to have visited Washington last Friday to put the case against
acceptance of the plan tabled by mediators Mr Vance and Lord Owen, again
struck a warning note at the weekend.
'The president (Mr Izetbegovic) needs to respond to the proper authorities,
who are not very pleased that lines may be drawn on the basis of ethnicity
and, as a result, the reception is lukewarm,' he said. Nor does the
declaration made by Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, after the
suspension of the talks on Saturday hold out much hope that he will prove
more flexible in the future than in the past.
While promising that he and his political colleagues would try to find 'the
possibilities for further compromises', he claimed that the Bosnian Serbs
had made the biggest compromises so far. Moreover, he warned that, if US
President Bill Clinton's threat to tighten sanctions against the Serbs if
they did not stop fighting was carried out, 'we would leave the conference'.
It is virtually certain that Mr Izetbegovic will return to New York with
more demands for territorial adjustments to the provincial map, which are
likely to prove unacceptable to the Bosnian Serbs.
Following the acceptance last week by the Bosnian Moslems of the ceasefire
and military disengagement provisions of the proposed peace settlement, the
mediators pulled out all the stops to persuade Mr Izetbegovic to endorse
their map. If he had, it would have left Mr Karadzic as the only leader of
the warring parties not to have endorsed it, and thus much more vulnerable
to international pressure.
The mediators' tactic of isolating Mr Karadzic, as they did earlier in the
negotiations when he was ultimately 'persuaded' by President Slobodan
Milosevic of Serbia to accept the new constitutional framework for Bosnia,
has thus been thwarted for the moment.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Danes try to break HDTV logjam
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC MINISTERS may be asked to rewrite a hard-won compromise on advanced
television standards as part of a Danish attempt to unblock the EC's
strategy on high-definition television.
Revision of existing legislation - agreed in December 1991 after 15 hours of
ministerial debate - would further dilute the EC's original standards-based
strategy for developing cinema-quality television in Europe.
However, outline proposals being prepared by Denmark, which holds the EC
presidency, have not yet gone far enough to attract the support of the UK.
Britain is blocking the European Commission's much-diluted Ecu500m (Pounds
413m) HDTV funding plan on the grounds that the spending is not justified.
Britain believes so-called 'Mac' technology backed by the EC will soon be
overtaken by digital HDTV under development in the US.
Denmark has yet to receive any hint that the UK will relax its position. The
Danes want to schedule a special early meeting of telecommunications
ministers, and prevent the scheduled May meeting from being overshadowed by
rows on HDTV.
The directive agreed in December 1991 dictates that only one intermediate
standard - called D2-Mac - can be used for wide-screen television broadcasts
in the EC. Wide-screen television sets must also be built to receive D2-Mac
transmissions. So far, Commission proposals for funding have reflected that
obligation.
But Denmark's compromise would allow funding for other wide-screen standards
and probably require the original directive to be broadened, to the benefit
of rival intermediate technologies such as PALplus, which is being developed
by a consortium of European broadcasters and manufacturers.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Mitterrand to press for emergency G7 summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCOIS Mitterrand, the French president, will meet US President Bill
Clinton for the first time tomorrow to get to know the new US leader and
push for an emergency Group of Seven summit to discuss an international
economic growth initiative.
The Washington meeting, to be held a fortnight before the French general
election, in which Mr Mitterrand's Socialist party looks set for defeat by
the right, seems as much designed to tell French voters that the president
plans to keep the upper hand in foreign policy as to forge links with the
new US administration.
On March 16 Mr Mitterrand plans to visit Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, just as the French election campaign enters its last few days
before the first round of voting on March 21.
Mr Mitterrand will press Mr Clinton for an emergency G7 meeting before the
July summit in Tokyo, a move supported by Germany, said Mr Jean Musitelli,
the president's spokesman.
'What is clear is that the president will be sitting in the front chair' at
such international gatherings, he added. France did not plan to abandon its
tradition of a single chief in international affairs.
The French president will use the Washington meeting to seek clarification
of the US administration's stance on the stalled multilateral trade talks
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Mr Clinton's recent
complaint over subsidies to the European Airbus consortium and US
anti-dumping duties on imported steel are also on his agenda.
At home, the opposition was showing increasing confidence yesterday in its
ability to hold its own against Mr Mitterrand in a government of
cohabitation between the Socialist president and a right-wing parliamentary
majority. Mr Bernard Pons, the parliamentary whip for the conservative RPR
party, yesterday warned Mr Mitterrand not to try to block the future
government's actions.
At a rally of 30,000 RPR supporters at Le Bourget, north of Paris, Mr Pons
accused Mr Mitterrand of handing out top jobs in the public administration
to friends, to keep as much power as possible. If the president tried to
obstruct the new government, the future prime minister would call repeated
confidence motions in the parliament, Mr Pons said.

<TEXT>
ITALY'S government is to spend over L7,000bn (Pounds 3.2bn) on additional
measures for job creation, unemployment benefit and development grants to
try to cushion the worsening recession.
The measures will put further strain on public-sector finances, which are
already rising above target this year. However, they should go some way
towards meeting union demands for extra help for the unemployed and
industries in crisis.
About 40,000 women marched through the streets of Rome at the weekend to
protest against the effects of recession, in a demonstration organised by
the country's three trade union federations.
The package should pave the way to a new round of meetings between
ministers, unions and employers' representatives to take up proposals on
reforms to labour laws outlined in last summer's accord to abolish the scala
mobile wage indexation system.
The economic package approved by ministers foresees the creation of a
L1,650bn national employment fund to stimulate job creation over the next
three years. About L3,500bn will go on re-industrialisation projects.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Swiss voters show signs of human weakness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Swiss have long prided themselves on having such a strong civic sense
that they will even vote for tax increases.
Yesterday, true to form, 55.2 per cent of those voting in a referendum
approved an increase in fuel taxes that will raise petrol prices by 20
centimes (9p) per litre.
But some Swiss see this, and the positive outcome of another vote yesterday,
on legalising gambling casinos, as evidence of a less admirable and perhaps
ominous trend among their countrymen.
According to this view, these votes show that the Swiss are becoming more
like everyone else. They would rather let the government tap new and
relatively painless sources of income than have it cut services to reduce
its bloated deficit.
The Swiss federal government's deficit has soared in the past two years,
reaching SFr2.86bn (Pounds 1.3bn) last year, about one per cent of gross
domestic product. Rising welfare payments and revenue shortfalls caused by
the recession mean that this year's budget deficit of SFr3.3bn will be
substantially exceeded, Mr Otto Stich, the finance minister, has predicted.
Mr Stich tried hard last autumn to win his colleagues' support for swingeing
spending cuts. When he failed, he proposed the two revenue raising measures
that were approved yesterday.
Mr Stich said that the petrol tax would add SFr1.3bn a year to federal
coffers, while still leaving Swiss petrol prices lower than those in
neighbouring countries.
He claimed casino legalisation would merely bring Switzerland in line with
other European countries, but opponents argued that their country did not
need another institution for money launderers to test.
Mr Stich believes the government, which proposes to take 80 per cent of
casinos' gross revenues, will raise about SFr150m a year from this source,
but it is unlikely to come quickly. Police forces have warned that neither
the potential casino operators nor the law enforcement agencies are
competent yet to deal with the kinds of criminals attracted to casinos.
A third national referendum, calling for the total abolition of vivisection,
was overwhelmingly defeated, with 72 per cent of those voting opposed. The
issue is a frequent one in the Swiss plebiscite lists.
Swiss voters return to the polls in June on two highly controversial topics
related to the Swiss army. One petition calls on the people to forbid the
army from buying new fighter aircraft for 10 years. The other would reduce
the number of battlefield train ing grounds at the army's disposal.

<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, the German automotive, aerospace and engineering group, is
considering opening a bus assembly factory near Shanghai in China and
setting up a local joint venture to manufacture rolling stock for
underground railway networks.
The opportunities opened up during a recent tour of the Far East, when
executives examined a possible site for the bus works close to the Yangtse
river.
'It was the most exciting trip I have undertaken in all my years at
Daimler,' one participant said.
The visit reflected growing interest among German companies in the region -
China in particular - and widespread determination that Japanese industry
should not be allowed to over-run the market unopposed.
It also demonstrated Daimler-Benz's new strategy of exploring every
possibility to extend manufacturing outside Germany and develop new markets.
This policy is being driven partly by the need to overcome the exchange rate
disadvantages inherent in exporting from Germany.
For example, the group board will decide this year whether to manufacture
its planned Mercedes-Benz leisure vehicle in the US. According to Mr Edzard
Reuter, chairman, there is a 'fair chance' that a new plant will be given
the go-ahead.
Meanwhile, the company will soon start assembling a small number of cars in
Mexico, and has recently signed a joint venture to make cars in Korea.
In a separate development, Siemens, Germany's largest electrical group, has
taken a 49 per cent stake in a telephone distribution and service joint
venture with TN Inc of Bangkok. The new company, TN Communications Systems,
aims to win a 25 per cent market share.
Siemens also recently founded a joint venture in Shanghai to make and
distribute telephone switchboards. South-East Asian telecommunications
markets are growing by more than 10 per cent a year compared with the world
average of 3 to 4 per cent.
German exports to China grew last year by a record 40 per cent to more than
DM5.5bn (Pounds 2.33bn), while the country's leading exporters said their
shipments to Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore rose by more than 10 per
cent.
According to the Hamburg-based East Asia Association, the improvement in
these markets more than offset a 10 per cent fall in exports to Japan last
year.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Rome warns against steel subsidy curbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Karel van Miert, EC competition commissioner, wants to outlaw L650bn
(Pounds 285.6m) of state subsidies to Ilva, Italy's loss-making state steel
company.
But some of his colleagues fear such an action could provoke a political
backlash from the Italian authorities and threaten EC plans to support the
ailing west European steel industry.
Senior aides to the 17 commissioners will today discuss whether Mr Van
Miert's proposals should be tabled at tomorrow's full meeting of the
European Commission.
At a special council of EC industry ministers 10 days ago Mr Giuseppe
Guarino of Italy said Rome would oppose the Community-wide steel plan if the
Commission did not back Ilva's L650bn recapitalisation. An Italian diplomat
warned last week that outlawing the aid package 'could detonate a bigger
problem'.
Some Commission officials have serious doubts about the timing of the
commissioner's move. 'I don't think (the proposal) will fly. It will be
postponed, because now there's an agreement in council and everything has to
be treated globally,' one said.
But Mr Van Miert, who has made clear that EC state aid rules will not be
relaxed for the steel industry, seems determined to call the bluff of the
Italian authorities. He wants Rome to recover L350bn already paid to the
loss-making steelmaker in the form of a capital increase, and freeze plans
to pay a second tranche of L300bn.
Italy has written to the commissioner urging him to delay a decision on the
subsidies until the Italian authorities have prepared a new restructuring
plan. This scheme, which Ilva says will be submitted by the end of next
month, will take into account the first impressions of Mr Hayao Nakamura,
the group's new Japanese managing director.
Mr Van Miert wants to discourage a damaging race by EC governments to
subsidise their national industries. He believes Brussels should also renew
pressure on the Spanish government, which is seeking approval for a
controversial aid package for its steel industry. So far he has not
submitted formal proposals on Spanish steel to avoid provoking Madrid.
This is not the first time that Rome has tried to delay an EC decision on
subsidies. Last July Mr Guarino wrote to Mr Van Miert's predecessor, Sir
Leon Brittan, urging him, unsuccessfully, not to start a formal
investigation into the state aid programme. The Commission was incensed by
Ilva's announcement of a L498bn loss in 1991, which cast doubt on an
original plan's stated objective of floating Ilva's shares.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Need a quality certificate? Ask Tom, Dick or Harry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH companies are paying thousands of pounds and spending hours of
management time to qualify for a quality standard which appears to have a
quality control problem of its own.
The BS5750 quality standard has already been obtained by about 17,000
companies. But it has now emerged that a loophole in the rules means anyone
can award a BS5750, which certifies that a company's internal procedures are
properly organised.
Consultancies and other organisations which issue and monitor BS5750
certificates are not required to register with the National Accreditation
Council for Certification Bodies (NACCB), an industry body which ultimately
answers to the Department of Trade and Industry.
'There appears to be absolutely no control over the organisations making the
award,' said Mr Stephen Halliday, principal lecturer in small business at
Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education. 'The government must take steps
to ensure that BS5750 can be awarded only by reputable, accredited
organisations.'
Two dozen organisations have been accredited but the NACCB estimates that up
to a dozen which have not registered are actively issuing certificates. Even
those wanting to register have to operate for between one and two years
without formal accreditation while the NACCB assesses their performance.
The NACCB said it thought buyers were sophisticated enough not to be taken
in by suppliers sporting certificates issued by 'cowboys.' But the British
Standards Institution, which is accredited and which has issued most BS5750
certificates, said it was concerned at this loophole. There is intense
commercial competition between the BSI and other certification
organisations, not least on price.
The discovery that anyone can offer the BS5750 will add to the controversy
surrounding the certificate. Some small businesses, which are increasingly
being required by large customers to obtain the certificate, complain that
its procedures are costly and unduly bureaucratic.
Most companies must pay a minimum of several thousand pounds in consultants'
and registration fees to prove they meet BS5750 requirements, and up to
Pounds 2,000 each year to show they still comply. Smaller companies,
especially, also find the process a significant burden on senior management
time.
Mr Paul Hewlett, secretary of the NACCB, said: 'The professional buyers are
pretty well educated to ask if their suppliers have been certified by an
accredited organisation. There is not much of a market for the cowboys.'
Only accredited certification organisations are allowed to put the NACCB
logo, consisting of a tick and crown, alongside the BS5750 logo, Mr Hewlett
said. But business organisations are concerned that many smaller companies
may not be aware of this distinction or that they have obtained BS5750 from
an unaccredited organisation.
The British Standards Institution said it had urged the government to impose
tighter controls and to give the NACCB greater powers but no action had been
taken.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Major faces setback in Maastricht vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT was last night bracing itself for the possibility of an
embarrassing House of Commons defeat over Maastricht despite Mr John Major's
public plea to Tory Euro-sceptics to end their rebellion against the treaty.
A defeat in the vote by MPs tonight on a minor amendment proposed by Labour
would not wreck ratification of the treaty. But it would undermine seriously
the prime minister's efforts to re-assert the government's authority at
Westminster.
Speaking at the Conservative spring conference in Harrogate on Saturday, Mr
Major told party activists that the party could no longer afford the
'luxury' of disunity. That view was echoed in warnings from colleagues that
important parts of the government's legislative programme were being
derailed by the row over Europe. The general atmosphere of uncertainty in
the highest ranks of the government was underlined by renewed weekend
speculation about a July cabinet reshuffle.
Sir Norman Fowler, Tory party chairman, rejected suggestions that he wanted
to return to the cabinet this year as chancellor or home secretary. He has
told Mr Major that he expects to stay at Conservative central office at
least until next year.
But Mr Norman Lamont's concern at the threat to his position as chancellor
from other senior colleagues was underlined by evidence that he is seeking
to improve his recent frosty relations with much of the media.
With some senior Conservatives suggesting Mr Major should appoint a new
chancellor in a limited July reshuffle, Mr Lamont has set up a series of
high-level meetings with newspaper editors after his March 16 Budget.
The chancellor's hope is that a favourable response to the Budget measures
will strengthen his case for remaining at the Treasury until a more
wide-ranging reshuffle pencilled in by Mr Major for mid-1994.
Last night, the Tory Euro- sceptics were unmoved by Mr Major's warning that
failure to ratify Maastricht would leave Britain 'irrelevant' in Europe.
They signalled they intended to vote tonight for a Labour amendment to the
legislation.
The amendment, which would ensure that British representatives on the
Community's new committee of the regions were elected rather than appointed,
would not itself affect the treaty.
But it would allow the Tory rebels and opposition parties to further prolong
debate by introducing a so-called 'report stage' into the legislation's
passage through the Commons. That would allow the rebels more time to press
their case for a referendum on the treaty and would further disrupt the
government's other legislation.
Ministers were insisting that a defeat might yet be avoided. Tory business
managers will today discuss the possibility of conceding the substance of
the Labour amendment ahead of a vote in the hope of winning the support of
the Liberal Democrats and other small opposition parties.
In an attempt to increase the pressure on the Tory rebels, ministers said
yesterday that new laws to enforce tougher penalties on young offenders and
to reform Sunday trading hours were among those facing delay because so much
time at Westminster was being taken up by Maastricht.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Barclays' chief promises to give up some powers: Buxton to
meet shareholders over concerns at quality of management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andrew Buxton, chairman and chief executive of Barclays Bank, yesterday
responded to investors' criticism of the bank's top management by promising
that 'a significant part' of his responsibilities would be passed to a new
senior executive during this year.
Mr Buxton, whose bank last week reported a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss and
halved its final dividend, acknowledged that he bore a share of the blame
for a rapid growth in property and construction lending in the late 1980s
which contributed to bad debt provisions of Pounds 2.5bn for 1992.
He told the Financial Times he accepted that shareholders had worries about
Barclays' management, but believed these were not overwhelming.
'I acknowledge that some shareholders are concerned, but I have not got the
impression that they want to fire the whole of the management team,' he
said.
Mr Buxton's remarks follow expressions of discontent from fund managers
holding about 15 per cent of the bank's shares over the quality of its
management. Some investors believe that Mr Buxton, who was appointed
managing director of the bank in May 1988, should resign.
Mr Buxton said the bank was considering appointing either an outsider or one
of its existing senior executives to a new senior post. This might not carry
the title of chief executive, but whoever was appointed would have to be
seen clearly to be taking over broad responsibilities.
'There is no point in bringing someone in from outside, or appointing
someone from within, who did not take a significant part of my
responsibilities away from me,' said Mr Buxton, who is to hold a series of
meetings with large shareholders over the next two weeks.
Mr Buxton said the bank's interim dividend of 9.15p was likely to be reduced
this year, but only as part of a 'realignment' of the new annual dividend of
15.15p. He said the bank was convinced that the new level of its annual
dividend, reduced by 28 per cent from 21.15p, was sustainable.
Although most institutions appear to favour the bank bringing in a new chief
executive from outside, there has been concern that the appointment of an
outsider could lead to senior figures such as Sir Peter Middleton, the
deputy chairman, leaving because their responsibilities would be reduced.
Mr Buxton said he was 'working closely' with Sir Peter and Mr Alastair
Robinson, the head of the banking division and an executive vice-chairman,
to ensure that no member of the existing senior management team was
surprised or offended by whatever change took place.
He did not believe he was in danger of losing executives such as Mr David
Band, BZW chief executive. 'That is not my impression of their mood. If I
suddenly jumped something on them without consulting them, I am sure they
would be extremely upset, but I am not going to do that,' he said.
Mr Buxton said he acknowledged his share of responsibility for the expansion
of lending in the late 1980s after he was appointed managing director under
Sir John Quinton, the former chairman. He bore responsibility both as a
board member, and as a senior executive.
'I was a member of the board then, and the board ultimately takes
responsibility for the bank. I also acknowledge that - with hindsight - when
I became managing director I wish I had jumped on the problem of expansion
earlier,' said Mr Buxton, who was appointed chairman in January.
He added that bad debts from the 1980s should not overshadow an 18.4 per
cent rise in operating profits in 1992. 'The management team has performed
pretty well if you look back at the past two years. Our decisions have been
constructive and good for shareholders.'

FT  08 MAR 93 / People: Taylor Woodrow recast
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Taylor Woodrow appears to have completed its senior management reshuffle
with the promotion of 46-year-old Brian Abrahams, currently responsible for
group trading activities and managing director of Greenham Trading, onto the
board. In turn, George Borwell, 66, chairman of Greenham Trading, will
retire from the board at the May agm.
When Colin Parsons took over as chairman of the big UK construction company
a year ago, he admitted that even he, as an operating director, sometimes
had difficulty in understanding the structure of the board, which at the
time was top-heavy and generally opaque. Since then, six directors have
left, and four new ones, including Abrahams, have been appointed.
A Taylor Woodrow man from the age of 16, when he joined as a junior in the
buying office, Abrahams has concentrated on the sales and marketing side. As
Borwell's protege, he pushed forward with the expansion of Greenham Trading,
which has a product range from contractors' tools to leisurewear and which
is one of the few businesses within the group that has continued to improve
its performance through the recession. Borwell, one of the doyens of
Greenham Trading, may be asked by the subsidiary board to become its
non-executive chairman. Taylor Woodrow reports its full year results on
March 30.

A Pounds 5m contract to install 12 400kW wind turbines at the new Kirkby
Moor wind farm in Cumbria has been won by TAYLOR WOODROW CONSTRUCTION
NORTHERN.
With a total capacity of 4.8MW, the wind farm at Kirkby-in-Furness will
supply electricity for the equivalent of 4,500 homes.
The wind farm project, a joint venture between National Power, South Wales
Electricity and Taylor Woodrow Construction Holdings, removes the need to
emit 12,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year in burning fossil fuels.
The turnkey construction contract for the Kirkby Moor wind farm company
includes civil works and installation of electrical equipment.

Mr Andrew Perloff, the rebel shareholder in Etonbrook, has requisitioned an
extraordinary general meeting of the property development company, in
another attempt to join the board and remove all of its existing directors.
Mr Perloff and his three companies own 29.9 per cent of Etonbrook. He
has failed once before to win a seat on the board but thwarted a
proposed capital restructuring at an EGM in September.
In January the former BES company blamed a drop in its interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 300,000 to Pounds 74,000 on costs incurred in fighting a
tender offer from Mr Perloff.

<TEXT>
MR ROBIN Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, intends to ask in
parliament this week whether Crescent Petroleum, a private oil company based
in Abu Dhabi, has been breaching government sanctions against Iraq, Robert
Taylor writes.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control in Washington and a number of US senate
committees are investigating the activities of Crescent Petroleum in the
United States. Mr Cook wants to know whether Mr Michael Heseltine's
department is inquiring into the company's affairs in Britain.
The owner of Crescent Petroleum, Mr Hamid Jaffar, has a brother, Mr Jaffar
Jaffar, who was the head of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme and a deputy
minister in the Iraqi defence ministry. Before Iraq's invasion of
Gulf Kuwait in 1990 Crescent Petroleum was planning a downstream
petroleum venture with the Iraqi government.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Daimler-Benz set for China expansion
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DAIMLER-BENZ, the German automotive, aerospace and engineering group, is
considering opening a bus assembly factory near Shanghai in China and
setting up a local joint venture to make rolling stock for underground
railway networks.
The opportunities opened up during a recent tour of the Far East, when
executives examined a possible site for the bus works close to the Yangtse
river.
'It was the most exciting trip I have undertaken in all my years at
Daimler,' one participant said.
The visit reflected growing interest among German companies in the region -
China in particular - and widespread determination that Japanese industry
should not be allowed to over-run the market unopposed.
It also demonstrated Daimler-Benz's new strategy of exploring every
possibility of extending manufacturing outside Germany and developing new
markets.
This policy is being driven partly by the need to overcome the exchange rate
disadvantages inherent in exporting from Germany.
For example, the group board will decide this year whether to manufacture
its planned Mercedes-Benz leisure vehicle in the US. According to Mr Edzard
Reuter, chairman, there is a 'fair chance' that a new plant will be given
the go-ahead.
Meanwhile, the company will soon start assembling a small number of cars in
Mexico, and has recently signed a joint venture to make cars in Korea.
In a separate development, Siemens, Germany's largest electrical group, has
taken a 49 per cent stake in a telephone distribution and service joint
venture with TN Inc of Bangkok. The new company, TN Communications Systems,
aims to win a 25 per cent market share.
Siemens also recently founded a joint venture in Shanghai to make and
distribute telephone switchboards.
South-East Asian telecommunications markets are growing by more than 10 per
cent a year compared with the world average of 3 to 4 per cent.
German exports to China grew last year by a record 40 per cent to more than
DM5.5bn (Dollars 3.31bn), while the country's leading exporters said their
shipments to Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore rose by more than 10 per
cent.
According to the Hamburg-based East Asia Association, the improvement in
these markets more than offset a 10 per cent fall in exports to Japan last
year.

luxury handbags buy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER

<TEXT>
TIME PRODUCTS, the UK watch and jewellery distributor, has paid Dollars 17m
(Pounds 11.9m) for the business of Judith Leiber, an American who designs
luxury handbags for the international jet-set.
Hollywood stars are among customers prepared to pay several thousand dollars
for a handbag made by Mrs Leiber, 72, who started her business 30 years ago
in New York.
A designer bag presented to Mrs Barbara Bush was valued at Dollars 1,245. It
showed a likeness of Millie, the presidential couple's pet dog.
Mrs Leiber will continue to run her company, which distributes only through
exclusive department stores and jewellers. Time Products has distributed her
handbags in the UK since 1991.
The UK company said the handbags had not been actively marketed outside
North America, and there was therefore potential for developing the brand
worldwide. There was scope for applying the name to merchandise other than
handbags, putting a broader range of products through the same
tightly-targeted distribution network.
Time Products also announced that it had paid Pounds 2m for a 5 per cent
stake in Audemars Piguet, the Swiss watchmaker which specialises in highly
technical and luxurious timepieces.
Mr Marcus Marguiles, chairman of Time Products, said: 'Judith Leiber is one
of the most highly-prized brands in North America and we are delighted to
have secured it, while our relationship with Audemars Piguet will be
strengthened by our investment.'
The Leiber business made pre-tax profits of Dollars 1m, after directors'
remunerations, on sales of Dollars 15m in the year to December 31. It had
net assets at that date of Dollars 5.1m.
Even after completing these acquisitions, Time Products has net cash of more
than Pounds 10m.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Thomas Cook considers offer for Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS Cook, the travel agency and financial services group, was last night
considering the final details of a tender offer for shares in Owners Abroad,
the tour company fighting a hostile bid from rival Airtours.
Representatives of Owners Abroad were meeting Thomas Cook and its advisers
to decide pricing and size of tender, accord- ing to sources close to the
companies.
Any cash tender could put a substantial obstacle in the way of Airtours' all
share and partial cash alternative offers as the bid enters its last full
week.
A tender offer, which could be as early as today or tomorrow and would have
to be made this week, is likely to be made dependent on shareholders
rejecting Airtours offer. At Friday night's close, the bid values Owners
Abroad at Pounds 290m, or 144p per share, through the paper offer.
The tender offer would need the approval of Westdeutsche Landesbank, the
German state bank that controls Thomas Cook, and LTU, the German travel
agency.
Thomas Cook has repeatedly reaffirmed its belief in the commercial tie-up
with Owners Abroad announced last year.
Once Airtours had launched its bid, Owners shareholders were almost
unanimous in describing as inadequate the equity swap which underpinned the
commercial transaction with Thomas Cook.
If Thomas Cook does make a tender offer, Owners Abroad's largest
shareholder, Mercury Asset Management, may take centre stage. Last week MAM
increased its stake in Owners Abroad to 14.07 per cent, from 13.4 per cent,
but gave no indication whether it would accept or reject the offers.
Reacting to the possibility of a tender offer, Mr David Crossland, Airtours
chairman, said Thomas Cook should bid for all the stock.
'LTU and Thomas Cook have tried to get into Owners Abroad on the cheap once
before,' he said. 'Shareholders will recognise this for what it is  - a
wrecking move supported by a desperate board.'
In judging where, or whether, to pitch a tender offer, Thomas Cook would
have to consider that if the offer were too high, allocation of shares would
be scaled down.
They would also be aware that some institutions are unlikely to be happy
being left with shares that no longer attracted a bid premium.

taken a 49 per cent stake in a telephone distribution and service joint
venture with TN Inc of Bangkok. The new company, TN Communications Systems,
aims to win a 25 per cent market share.
Siemens also recently founded a joint venture in Shanghai to make and
distribute telephone switchboards. South-East Asian telecommunications
markets are growing by more than 10 per cent a year compared with the world
average of 3 to 4 per cent.
German exports to China grew last year by a record 40 per cent to more than
DM5.5bn (Pounds 2.33bn), while the country's leading exporters said their
shipments to Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore rose by more than 10 per
cent.
According to the Hamburg-based East Asia Association, the improvement in
these markets more than offset a 10 per cent fall in exports to Japan last
year.

FT  08 MAR 93 / US navy proposes the closure of a third of its port bases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US navy is proposing a radical realignment of its port bases, offering
to close about a third of its installations and concentrate on two main
ports at Norfolk, in Virginia, and San Diego, in California.
The proposal is part of a list of proposed military base closures presented
to Mr Les Aspin, defence secretary, by each of the US armed services, on the
basis of which Mr Aspin will submit his own list to a presidential base
closure commission.
The independent commission was set up as a way of circumventing the deadlock
that ensued every time the Defence Department tried to close a military
base, as every member of Congress fought to avoid cuts in his or her
district. Congress is restricted to voting yes or no on the entire list
instead of each individual closure.
The process remains highly politicised, nonetheless, and members of Congress
are already rallying in support of their home bases.
The cuts are expected to hit particularly hard in northern California, where
the faltering economy would be further hurt by the proposed closure of a
number of installations in the San Francisco Bay area.
In a move that is unlikely to be seen as accidental, all five bases in the
Oakland district of Congressman Ron Dellums, the new chairman of the House
of Representatives Armed Services committee and an advocate of deeper cuts
in defence spending, are understood to be proposed for closure.
Another controversial proposal is the Homestead air force base in Florida,
targeted for closure until Hurricane Andrew devastated the area last year.
Former President George Bush promised at the time to keep the base open.

FT  08 MAR 93 / Yeltsin urges plebiscite on crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, declared yesterday that the country
was in the grip of a constitutional crisis and that a referendum on who
rules the country should go ahead, Reuter reports from Moscow.
In an interview broadcast on Moscow radio, Yeltsin said he wanted to reach
an accord with conservative rivals, expected to challenge him at this week's
session of the Congress of People's Deputies, the top legislature.
'I very much hope to achieve concord at the Congress between the legislative
and executive authorities and the president,' he said.
'If the Congress cancels the decision to hold a referendum, and the Congress
could do it, this will show a lack of trust in the people,' he said.
The referendum has been called for April 11 to determine who rules Russia -
president or parliament.
Yeltsin's seven-minute interview, showed that he was counting on the
plebiscite to strengthen his mandate for radical reform.
Yeltsin and his main rival, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, parliament chairman, have
been exchanging verbal blows for weeks as a struggle between the executive
and legislative authorities has intensified.
This week's emergency Congress, due to open on Wednesday, could bring the
conflict to a head. Conservative deputies are expected to renew efforts to
trim Mr Yeltsin's powers. Many oppose the referendum, which they warn could
destabilise the country further and even lead to its disintegration.
Yeltsin called for unity to resolve a crisis whose roots he said lay in the
contradictory constitution inherited from the Soviet era.
'I have become convinced that it is not those on the right, nor those on the
left, nor the centrists, nor the communists, nor the democrats who can save
Russia . . . We need consensus among parties and organisations,' he said.
Yeltsin even held out an olive branch to communists, whose party he once
outlawed. 'There are also healthy communists who support Russia and its
revival and accordingly do not want to wage a confrontational struggle,' he
said.
Conservative deputies are worried that the president might call upon the
armed forces to back him if he does not get his way in the Congress. But
Defence Minister Pavel Grachev vowed at the weekend that the army would stay
neutral in the conflict.
'The army . . . will not participate in political games. That would be
dangerous,' Mr Grachev told Rossiskiye Vesti newspaper.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NOT only history and John le Carre have immortalised Weimar and Bonn. Both
happen to share the same post code: 5300. But not for much longer, if an
ambitious plan by the German post office is implemented as scheduled on July
1.
On that day the two separate post codes of the two Germanys will be
superseded by a new system aimed at making the postal service more efficient
and faster.
Mr Norbert Schafer, a post office official, said it was only a matter of
time before the two systems had to be harmonised. 'The west German postal
codes system was introduced in 1961 (the year the Berlin Wall was built).
The east German system, which was more rational because it had more post
codes which thus covered much smaller areas, was introduced in 1965. But
there are 800 towns and cities in east and west Germany which share the same
postal code. There's lots of room for error.'
Introduction of the new system, at a cost of DM400m (Dollars 240.9m) and
after nearly two years' research and testing, involves scrapping the current
5,400 codes and replacing them with 26,000 new ones.
The first casualty will be the suffix placed after every city, town and
village, which characterised only the western German system and which
denoted a particular district. Instead, all cities, towns and villages will
have a prefix only.
For instance, Berlin's trendy Savignyplatz, whose post code is currently
W-1000 Berlin 12, will be changed to 10623. 'The W (for West), and the O
(Ost or East) will no longer exist,' explains Mr Schafer. 'The first two
numbers of the new system will denote the region. The last three numbers
denote the post office allocated to your new post code.'
Mr Klaus Lammich, an official from the transport and telecommunications
department of the Federation of German Industry, says he has received
complaints from members, mostly about the cost. 'But overall, we accept it
because it is necessary.'
Quelle, the country's giant retail and mail-ordering service, says the
short-term effects will be difficult, but longer term its business should
profit from a faster postal service. Mr Eric Jesker, a spokesman for Quelle,
says it will cost the company around DM30m to change their entire data
system.
'Once July 1 comes, that's it. There no room for tolerance. There's no room
for mistakes. If you use the old post code, your letter will not get
delivered,' he says.
If it works, 5300 Bonn and 5300 Weimar will be another relic of the past.

MR ROBIN Cook, Labour's trade and industry spokesman, intends to ask in
parliament this week whether Crescent Petroleum, a private oil company based
in Abu Dhabi, has been breaching government sanctions against Iraq, Robert
Taylor writes.
The Office of Foreign Assets Control in Washington and a number of US senate
committees are investigating the activities of Crescent Petroleum in the
United States. Mr Cook wants to know whether Mr Michael Heseltine's
department is inquiring into the company's affairs in Britain.
The owner of Crescent Petroleum, Mr Hamid Jaffar, has a brother, Mr Jaffar
Jaffar, who was the head of Iraq's nuclear weapons programme and a deputy
minister in the Iraqi defence ministry. Before Iraq's invasion of
Gulf Kuwait in 1990 Crescent Petroleum was planning a downstream
petroleum venture with the Iraqi government.

   NEWS of the Dumplington decision
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a Pounds 200m proposal for one of the UK's largest out-of-town shopping
centres - was greeted with dismay by local authorities, developers and
retailers who fear it will further increase already fierce competition, to
the detriment of the many shopping centres in the greater Manchester area.
A consortium of eight of greater Manchester's 10 metropolitan district
councils and five large property developers, which opposed the Dumplington
proposal, is considering whether to mount a High Court challenge, its
spokesman Mr David Kaiserman said yesterday.
Mr Kaiserman, senior assistant city planning officer for Manchester City
Council, said:
'We see development of this type making it even more difficult to achieve
regeneration in the inner parts of the city. A large peripheral development
appealing only to people who have cars is not doing anything at all in our
view in net terms for urban regeneration.'
Mr David Brown, president of the Manchester Chamber of Trade and manager of
the city's Arndale Centre, said: 'Something like this will have an effect on
all levels of trade in the city of Manchester and other surrounding towns
and will inevitably lead to job losses in the city centre. It will affect
the big multiples and the small guys.'
Mr Brown said there was already a 'massive choice' of retail outlets in
Manchester and the 10 large towns in an outlying 10-mile radius: 'There
isn't really a need for another major shopping complex of this size.' The
free car parking likely to be part of Dumplington was of particular concern.
The consortium for which Mr Kaiserman speaks includes P&amp;O, owners of
Manchester's Arndale Centre, MEPC, Land Securities, Norwich Union and
Shudehill, a company formed by the Co-operative Insurance Society and the
Co-operative Wholesale Society.
Shudehill has planning permission from Manchester City Council for a 500,000
sq ft retail development on a rundown site it largely owns beside the
Arndale Centre. Mr Kaiserman said Shudehill had indicated it would have to
reconsider its plan in view of the Dumplington decision.
Boots, the chemists chain, said it was opposed to the Dumplington
development because of concerns about how it would affect city-centre
shopping.
Mr Roger Tym, a development economist representing Boots, said several other
retailers and developers were also opposed to the centre: 'In short, it's
not over yet.'
He said there was evidence that similar out-of-town developments such as
Lakeside, Meadowhall and Merry Hill had damaged city-centre trade.
'At Lakeside, one major national retailer has found that 95 per cent of its
new store trade had come from other stores within a fairly tight
circumference of that development,' he said.
Dixons, the electrical retailer, and Marks and Spencer, the food and
clothing retailer, said yesterday they would probably examine the
development, although both have several large stores in the Manchester area.
However, Trafford Metropolitan borough council, in whose area Dumplington
lies, welcomed the decision by Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary.
Mr Michael Crawley, senior assistant director for planning, said it would
contribute to regeneration at Trafford Park and complement rather than
adversely affect other cen-tres.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO portraits, one by Reynolds, the other by Gainsborough, which had been
stolen from the Great Hall at Lincoln's Inn in London in 1990, were
recovered this week when they were brought into Sotheby's for evaluation.
They had been bought at the Bermondsey market in London for Pounds 145 for
the two, and the new owner, who had no idea of their provenance, carried the
two canvases to the auction house in a plastic bin liner.
Ms Lucy Hodson, of Sotheby's British pictures department, was called down to
the front desk to examine the paintings and immediately recognised them as
the work of Reynolds and Gainsborough.
She checked with the Art Loss Register and discovered they were the missing
paintings.
'I could not believe my eyes when this man pulled these two paintings from
the bin bag,' she said. 'Both of them had been taken from their frames when
they were stolen and the Gainsborough was rolled up. The Reynolds is smaller
and was still on its stretcher but I recognised them straight away.'
A portrait of William Pitt the Younger by Gainsborough, which was also
stolen in the raid, has yet to be recovered.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND suspect was expected to be charged yesterday in connection with
last week's bombing of New York's World Trade Centre, which killed five
people and injured more than 1,000.
US investigators said they planned to place charges for interfering with
investigations into the case.
New York City police commissioner Raymond Kelly yesterday said more arrests
were expected in the case.
The second arrest in the case followed Thursday evening's charging of Mr
Mohammed Salameh, a Moslem fundamentalist who was arrested as he tried to
retrieve Dollars 400 for a rented van alleged to have contained the bomb.
Mr Salameh was charged with aiding and abetting the bombing and subsequent
fire and with transporting explosives across state lines. If convicted, he
could receive a life sentence.
Mr Salameh was arrested when he returned to collect a deposit on the van.
The rental agreement named him and gave his address.
Details of the charge against Mr Salameh pointed to him as the builder of
the massive bomb that blasted a 100-ft-wide hole in an underground parking
garage at the centre.
The complaint said tools and parts were found at an apartment Mr Salameh
used and that a police expert said they were evidence of a 'bomb-maker'.
US District Judge Richard Owen ordered Mr Salameh to be held without bail.
Investigators are still looking for other suspects, and the FBI warned that
the investigation would probably continue for many months.
New York Governor Mario Cuomo yesterday asked President Bill Clinton to
declare New York a major disaster area, which would allow the city to get
federal funding to help clean up the rubble, install new security measures
at the centre's twin towers and counsel displaced workers.
The federal Small Business Administration has already declared the area an
economic disaster zone, thereby making business owners eligible for
low-interest loans.
In a letter to the president, Mr Cuomo estimated the costs of the bombing at
more than Dollars 700m. Mr Cuomo's estimates were in line with earlier
projection's by the city's comptroller, Ms Elizabeth Holtzman. However,
officials at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which owns and
operates the complex, believe the figures will be even higher.

FT  06 MAR 93 / World News in Brief: Italian cabinet moves to limit
corruption fall-out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The cabinet of Italian prime minister Giuliano Amato last night approved
measures to limit the damage caused by a political corruption and bribery
scandal which is tearing the country apart. Ignoring opposition protests
that it was granting an amnesty, the cabinet backed a package changing the
rules on party funding and offering leniency to corrupt politicians who
confess, return bribes and leave office.

Those who would like an inexpensive holiday with simple food at reasonable
cost can pencil in The Worms Head hotel, Rhossili, in south Wales, which is
being refurbished by enterprising Welsh chef Colin Pressdee.
Pressdee, bouncy presenter of food and recipe ideas on BBC Radio Wales, is
busy redecorating and menu planning. The hotel is open now but wait until
Easter when the workmen will have departed.
Local seafood - try the gratin of laverbread and cockles - and home-cooked
hams will more than satisfy the students and keen walkers whom Pressdee
hopes to attract. With simple single rooms starting at Pounds 10 a night and
ensuite doubles at Pounds 25 he should not have too much trouble filling the
24 bedrooms. Views are stunning. Tel: 0792-390512.
*****
Welsh Food Fortnight continues next week with six top Welsh chefs showing
some of London's restaurants their secrets. Franco Taruschio is cooking at
Turners (071-584-6711), Peter Jackson at the Goring Hotel (071-396-9000),
Stephen Bull at his own Bistro (071-490-1750), Chris Chown at Alastair
Little (071-734-5183), Dominic Gilbert at Hilaire (071-584-8993) and Dai
Davies at the House of Lords (presumably you need a friendly peer to sign
you in).

FT  06 MAR 93 / How To Spend It: Crystal designs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN age dominated by mass-produced pieces Cumbria Crystal's hand-made full
lead crystal stands out as much for the manner of manufacture as for quality
of design. Though most designs are based on 18th and 19th century classical
antique pieces, lending an air of antiquity, Cumbria Crystal evolved only in
1975, when five friends with an interest in antique glass started a company
devoted to producing clear, uncut full lead crystal, using traditional
techniques. The original designs, such as Ambleside, are to my mind the
nicest - their air of gentle Englishness, of simple but not stark lines,
make them desirable vessels for imbibing anything from Elderflower cordial
to finest claret. Then there are hard-to-find shapes such as old-fashioned
jelly glasses, capacious but clean-lined punch-bowls, decanters, and
straight-sided tumblers. Although I prefer the simplest designs the shapes
also come with decorative cutting, from the most elegant, Hellvellyn (a
favourite of British embassies) to the most ornate, Grasmere (the
best-seller). Find Cumbria Glass at Asprey's, Selfridges, Harrods, John
Lewis and other quality stores. The Ambleside range, above, costs from
Pounds 29 for wine goblets to Pounds 160 for the Captain's decanter. The
factory shop at Lightburn Road, Ulverston, Cumbria (tel: 0229-54400) sells
cheaper seconds.

FT  06 MAR 93 / As they say in Europe: The bathing beauties of
nation-building - The former Communist nation which is embracing Western
culture - pin-ups and all
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'SHYNESS IS not conducive to beauty,' was the main headline in the Slovak
daily Narodna Obrada last Monday. That story was about the Miss Slovakia
contest.
Narodna Obrada means 'National Revival.' It looks like an old Communist
daily, so even now it is a bit of a jolt to see a picture of a dozen bathing
beauties in the slot on the front page which might, four years ago, have
been reserved for a party functionary.
But it seems the beauty contest is one of the instruments of nation-building
in central Europe today. The Slovak occasion became a story in which 'a
hundred thousand juries around the country could make their own judgment.'
The event was reported through the eyes of last year's Queen and it was she
who produced the memorable quotation that provided the headline in my first
paragraph. The message was that the country, now free of the Czech yoke,
could encourage its youth to participate fully in the European experience.
The creation of a new sense of nationhood is not easy for those emerging
from the communist trauma, especially if the nationhood itself is new.
In this endeavour governments aim at a nice mix of tradition and capitalist
modernity to reassure citizens that not only are they now part of the world
which they have envied for so long, but their society has sound, ancient
roots. A similar movement between the wars ended up as fascism.
But there are more recent precedents for the process. Thirty years ago
Michael Frayn, the British writer, noted the psychological upheaval that hit
the post-colonial states which were striving to assert their independence
before a sceptical world. So he composed a suitable anthem for an emergent
nation anxious to create that hard-to-find image of ancient modernity:
'Freedom's historic home, Our oft-embattled nation, Now boasts the finest
water-skiing And modern sanitation.'
Recently I had a fascinating conversation with a senior official of the
central bank of Slovakia. It ranged from the role of St Svatopluk as founder
of the Slovak nation in the tenth century to the well-managed national
budget of today. The deficit, it emerged, is well under 3 per cent of gross
domestic product, only half that of the Czech Republic.
This curious combination of themes is frequently heard in the former
Communist world: 'A sound monetary policy can be constructed through the
assertion of national authenticity in the financial domain.' This kind of
thinking inspired me to update Frayn's anthem to render it suitable for one
of the 'economies in transition' as they are known:
'Now wakes our long oppressed land To offer incentives superior, And ensure
the market's hidden hand Meets fiscal convergence criteria.'
But the trouble in Eastern Europe is that it is the song of yesterday that
one hears. In Budapest the talk is of yuppies, in Warsaw property
speculation has been the rage. In Slovakia, with its beauty contests, it is
evidently the day before yesterday that provides the model.
Separatist and national movements generate specific fads and Western Europe
sets trends here too. It likes to think itself immune to the virus which has
horribly afflicted much of the central part of the continent, but
disintegration under the guise of national rights exists here too.
Nobody takes much notice of what goes on in Belgium but this week has
provided new guidelines for those who wish to square the circle of tradition
and modernity.
As Slovakia watched its strapping beauties simper down the catwalk, the
Gazet van Antwerpen produced the splash headline, 'Clean air, beautiful
water, peace in vehicle-free town centres - Flanders paradise in 2002.'
This was the prospect laid out by the Flanders regional government in a
policy document on the next nine years. Another daily, De Standaard, led on
the same story and had a picture of the new official poster which shows a
couple in a half-embrace and the slogan, 'Flanders-Europe 2002.'
Those who cannot stand their neighbours often believe they can live
harmoniously with more distant nations in a wider community. Flems, Serbs,
Scots and Slovaks each carry some mythical picture of the European ideal
into which they will perfectly fit.
The historical basis of this ideal is flimsy: the state of communications
has not up to now permitted the ancient regions of Europe to slug it out in
the manner of, say, the English and the French.
But as a Welsh friend of mine once pointed out, a Europe filled with people
who have scarcely heard of each other might be easier to handle than
anything else that is likely to emerge.

FT  06 MAR 93 / The monarch's assassin: Why deer culling is necessary in the
Scottish Highlands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINTER'S SEVERITY bleaches the colour from the Scottish Highlands, as the
heather's blaze is replaced by monochromes of snow and rock. To most, the
hills are a picture of still life. To Malcolm, they are a living chessboard.
Malcolm McCarthy has been a professional stalker for 30 years and is of his
ilk, blending kindness with irony. He loves his deer and so culls them
heavily. His employer's estate is part of a deer management programme
monitored by the Red Deer Commission. This year they have to shoot 35 hinds
to meet their quota. Throughout the Highlands other stalkers on other
estates are already busy culling.
It is a hard task. Dick Youngson, senior deer officer of the government's
Red Deer Commission, has watched the deer population rise from 270,000 a
decade ago to 300,000 today. According to Youngson, that is 50,000 deer too
many. 'The Scottish deer population consists of 86,000 stags, 160,000 hinds
and 54,000 calves. We are working closely with all the deer management
groups to achieve an overall stock of 110,000 hinds, to produce an annual
birth of 40,000 calves, both male and female.'
The prize for this endeavour is great: the return of the original Caledonian
forest. Once the open Highland hills supported a native woodland of Scots
pine, birch and rowan. That environment has all but disappeared through
overgrazing.
The government's agency, Scottish Natural Heritage, is bent on the
restoration of the woods. But this can only be achieved by controlling the
deer. On this, all are agreed, though some question whether it is
practicable to turn back the environmental clock hundreds of years.
Others point to the 9.4m sheep close-cropping the Scottish vegetation at a
cost, in tax-payers' subsidies, of Pounds 25 per hill ewe. They contest
that, rather than taking drastic action against the Highlands' natural
inhabitants, the red deer, we should reduce the number of their domesticated
competitors.
It is an attractive argument, especially for those who view the Highlands
either as a sporting playground or as a natural, glorious wilderness. To the
Highlander, it is neither: the hills are his livelihood. It is a precarious
one. Many suspect that the subsidies will go eventually, and with them the
hill-farmer's life. Until then, the sheep stay and the deer are blamed for
the environmental damage.
There are some politics in this. In urban Scottish offices the bitter memory
of the Highland Clearances remain: the sheep are the working man's, the deer
are the laird's. If there is a problem with overgrazing, the landowner must
deal with it, by eradicating the deer if necessary.
In the Highlands, they are more pragmatic. According to a survey by the
British Association for Shooting and Conservation, field sports contribute
Pounds 173m to the Scottish economy, of which deer-stalking brings in Pounds
9m. To shoot a single stag costs an average of Pounds 250 - and the estate
keeps the carcass. The estates, their stalkers and ghillies, the hotels,
restaurants and a plethora of other local services rely on this annual
injection of visitors' cash.
The Scottish stag season only lasts four months, however, and estates have
to be manned year-long. The big payers, the Germans, are now looking
eastwards, where the rich forests of Romania and Hungary produce huge red
deer with forests of antlers.
Red deer hinds, having no antlers, have no commercial value other than their
meat and this barely makes enough to pay the stalker's wages. In good years,
venison off the hill will fetch 70p per pound, making an average hind worth
Pounds 50. Most of the venison is sold to Germany and Belgium, where the
average consumer is used to eating game regularly.
However, this is a fickle market. Continental prices for venison were
shattered following the Chernobyl radiation fallout and the discovery that
Scandinavian reindeer had grazed irradiated mosses. Commercial deer farming
has also had an effect. The venison market is beginning to recover but at
the moment a hill beast is fetching just 40p a pound.
With the hinds producing little income and stalkers still needing to be
paid, some deer forest owners have chosen to let staff go and their hind
cull slide. To an extent, they can rely on nature. Deer can withstand
intense cold so long as it is dry, but succumb rapidly to prolonged wet,
windy weather. Having lost condition, the deer die from exposure and
starvation.
With this in mind, I wriggled through the snow-melt after Malcolm. Way down
in the glen we had spied a small parcel of hinds feeding some 300 ft above
us. We had made slow progress. A shifting breeze had threatened to carry our
scent, forcing us to climb above the hinds where a steady breeze allowed an
approach. Then a single hind, sensing our approach, had kept us pinned in
the bottom of an icy burn.
Finally, our surveyor moved off. Malcolm took the rifle from me and we slid
forward for 30 yards on our stomachs. He checked the rifle, worked a round
into the chamber and placed it carefully on his knapsack. Head buried, he
signaled me alongside. 'The two hinds on the left. If either of them turns
broadside on, shoot.'
One does, and collapses. The hinds stop, unable to see or smell us and
unsure as to the direction of the gunfire. A second beast turns sideways,
allowing a heart shot. Already dead, its reflexes send it crashing down the
hill. A third hind disappears over the brow. That, it seems, is that. We
stay hidden for three minutes then walk forward to gather the beasts and
inspect them. One is in good condition, the other two have sparse coats and
one weighs little more than a yearling calf. These two were destined for
early starvation. Sharing the carcasses between us, we begin the long drag
down the hill.
In a way, hind-stalking is assassin's work, with the deer unconscious of the
danger and of the bullet. Yet who could deny that it is a better death,
coming instantly, than the slow decline into starvation? Or that in order to
pursue a green policy in managing our uplands, it is sometimes necessary to
stain the snow red?

FT  06 MAR 93 / Skiing: In the Valleys of confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARNOLD WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE so many possibilities to get it right and get it wrong when skiing
in France's Les Trois Vallees. The vast ski arena that surrounds Courchevel
(1500, 1650 and 1850) Le Praz, La Tania, Meribel (Mottaret, 1400 and Les
Allues), Les Menuires (Croisette, Reberty and Praranger) St Martin de
Belleville and Val Thorens is truly awe-inspiring and equally confusing,
especially for skiers who have never previously visited any of the resorts.
How do you find your way around this maze of green, blue, red and black
runs, never mind the dozens of off-piste itineraires? How do decide whether
to go the whole hog and buy a 3-Valleys lift pass for your stay, or just a
Belleville Valley pass, a Meribel Valley Pass or a Courchevel Valley Pass,
perhaps upgrading to a full 3-Valleys pass for the occasional day when you
want to ski far and wide?
If you do decide to ski all three valleys in one day, will you be worrying
all day about missing the last lift home and contemplating the cost of an
overnight stay in the wrong valley, or a taxi ride home to the right one?
Will you know where to find the out-of-the-way mountain restaurants for a
last-minute hot chocolate? Or the extra-special runs that you might miss
even if you come here every year?
Even if you live and work in Les Trois Vallees you can never know every run.
I have been visiting the area for 15 years, but it was only after a solid
fortnight this year of trying to explore as many nooks and crannies as
possible that I began to put the jig-saw together.
In terms of skiing logistics, the Meribel Valley is probably the best base.
Whether you visit the Courchevel Valley or the Belleville Valley (Val
Thorens, Les Menuires or St Martin de Belleville) you need only be two or
three lifts away from getting up and over whichever mountain ridge you have
chosen to cross.
If you are staying in Courchevel 1650 or 1850, a visit to Val Thorens, or
Les Menuires, or St Martin de Belleville barely gives you time for lunch
before you have to start backtracking, even if you are a fast skier, so it
is important to plan your journey properly. Likewise, if you are staying in
the Belleville Valley, a visit to 1650 only allows time for a speedy lunch.
What are the key lifts and when is the last one?
If you end up in Les Menuires or St Martin de Belleville when you are
staying in Val Thorens, it is simple and inexpensive to get a bus home. It
is also not a major setback to miss the last gondola from Mottaret towards
Menuires and catch the Combes triple orange chair and Roc de Tougne button
lift instead, but unless you catch the connecting Grand Lac button lift back
to Roc des Trois Marches you will end up in La Croisette.
This is fine if that is where you are staying, but a nuisance if you are
staying at Reberty-Bruyeres, which will involve a walk, a navette (which
runs until 7 pm) or a taxi - not the end of the world, but an irritation. If
you end up in 1650 when you are staying in 1850, or vice versa, there is a
similar problem.
In Les Menuires there are pluses and minuses both on your doorstep in the
Belleville Valley and in skiing over the hills and far away. Your nearest
skiing is on La Masse, often ignored by skiers intent on trying to get to
Courchevel and back in a day, and therefore often queueless. Ski La Masse in
the morning: it will be in shadow in the afternoon and often cold, but that
also means the snow is often better.
Do not miss the off-piste itineraire down the back of La Masse to the Lac de
Lou - a wonderful, away-from-it-all descent with stunning scenery. Any
problems with the occasional steep mogulfield can be circumvented by
traversing to the left or right. It is a wonderful introduction to easy-ish
off-piste. There is an equally easy route to the lake (do not ski over it,
even if everyone else is) from Cime de Caron at Val Thorens.
Also do not miss the delightful, leisurely and long ski all the way down to
the only old town in the valley, St Martin de Belleville (return by coach or
taxi) with its picturesque floodlit monastery, or the Pourquoi Pas Piano
Bar, with its roaring fire, quaint cellar and exotic 'Lumumbas' (hot
chocolate, cognac and cream).
And do ski the Maurienne Valley. opened up three or four years ago at the
back of Cime de Caron - another vast, desolate valley with easy-ish
off-piste skiing, a refuge/restaurant at the bottom and a chair to bring you
back. The valley can also be skied after a half hour's traverse along the
shoulder of the Pointe de Thorens, reached via the Moraine quad chair and
the (rather chilly) Col double chair which takes you to the summer skiing
area in the shadow of the magnificent Aiguille de Peclet (11,630 ft).
From the same location you can ski one of the classic descents in the
Tarentaise: a superb 15 kilometre descent from the Gebroulax Glacier right
down to Mottaret. This is an arduous but not particularly difficult run with
breathtaking scenery that first involves about an hour walking up either on
skins or carrying your skis. A guide is advisable as there are some huge
crevasses. Although they are easily negotiated, you will enjoy the descent
much more without the worry]
Meribel is the cross-roads of the three valleys, and usually the worst area
for lift queues. If the Pas du Lac bubble and Ramees chair are crowded, try
the cognoscenti's special by-pass round the back: the long La Truite green
run. You would never know it was there, and it brings you - gently - to the
Burgin Saulire gondola.
If that too is crowded, take Rhodos 1 and 2 (12-person gondolas which take
you above the Altiport) and from there either take the Rocher de la Loze
chair direct to Courchevel - a beautiful sunny route that brings you in
above La Tania and Le Praz - or the Frasse and Saulire button lifts high
towards Saulire (although not quite high enough) before dropping down to
fill spare places in the top stage of either the Burgin Saulire gondola or
the Pas du Lac bubble.
Once into the Courchevel Valley, the Les Creux area above 1650 - accessed by
taking the Jardin Alpin gondola from 1850 and traversing just below the
airport - is worth studying on the map. Both this lift and Marmottes next to
it are important routes when returning from Courchevel to Meribel via the
all-important Aiguille Fruit chair and Les Creux button lifts. So is another
adjacent lift, Les Suisses. Although this involves a black (of the same
name) it is not a difficult one.
Opposite these three get-you-home lifts is the Chanrossa chair, which takes
you to some of the most contrasting runs in the three valleys. From the top
you can ski the biggest bump run in the region or drift down Roc Merlet and
Pyramide to a major cross roads near Le Signal at the top of the Roc Mugnier
chair, which starts only yards from the Aiguille Fruit and Les Creux lifts.
Do not miss the lower Creux run itself, a wonderful, swooping, gun-barrel
trail.
From the top of Roc Mugnier there is some exhilarating motorway skiing
beneath the orange Ariondaz gondola to 1650. On the way down you will pass
the sunny deck of probably the best mountain restaurant in Les Trois
Vallees, the Bel Air. The service is electrifying, the food good and the
smiles fulsome. Otherwise enjoy a no-nonsense snack in 1650, in contrast to
the more chic restaurants in 1850. You can get a cheap and cheerful meal in
the sun at the Signal Bar, for example.
Finally, try to obtain a Les Trois Vallees piste map before you go: an
hour's study will save precious skiing time later.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Skiing: Keep it in the family at Snowmass
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE few places more suited for an English-speaking family skiing
holiday than Aspen's Snowmass village, in the heart of America's Rocky
Mountains.
Aspen and families might seem an unlikely combination, given that the
attractive Victorian mining town is the most glitzy US skiing resort - a
sort of Hollywood winter retreat. And Aspen Mountain is hardly kid's stuff:
a mogul skier's delight, it boasts not a single green run. Yet just 20
minutes up the valley of the Roaring Fork River lies Snowmass, a resort with
miles of varied intermediate skiing which is tailor-made for families.
Snowmass is friendly, informal and more down to earth than Aspen. It is also
extremely children-friendly. It may cost more than Europe, and be farther
away, but it has two big advantages. The first is that Americans speak the
same language (more or less) - no small thing when you are half-way up a
mountain seeking advice on how to get to the bottom. The second is the
quality of instruction. Americans generally like and relate to children in a
way that Europeans (Britons especially) seem to find harder.
This shines through at most ski schools, where the instructors clearly enjoy
the company of their charges and the emphasis is on having fun and
bolstering self-confidence.
So, having decided on a US holiday, why pick Snowmass? First, because it is
in the Rockies, which gets better snow than icy New England. Second, because
of its huge expanse of intermediate skiing, which absorbs large numbers of
skiers and still leaves uncrowded slopes and virtually no lift lines. For
advanced skiers, the mountain also offers challenging terrain, such as the
Hanging Valley run, although real experts will tend to head for Aspen
Mountain and a third local resort, Aspen Highlands, both of which are
covered with difficult black trails.
And third, because the Snowmass ski school is outstanding. In surveys it is
consistently ranked among America's top learning centres, together with the
one at a fourth mountain in the Aspen area, Buttermilk.
Victor Gerdin, director of the Snowmass school, says his children's
instructors are all people who have specified that they want to work with
kids - and it shows in their exuberant encouragement and endless patience.
Certainly my three children - David, nine, Lizzie, seven and Kate, five -
all rated their instructors 'really great.'
By the end of a week Kate, who had barely skied before, had advanced from
crude snowploughs to parallel 'hockey stops' and tricks like skiing
backwards. David and Lizzie also made good progress, and particularly liked
the special 'kid's trail map' marking secret spots - such as 'Jaws' and
'Pinball Alley' - around the mountain that are not known to adults.
The school offers several children's programmes. There is day-care for
infants from 18 months to three years; an introductory ski programme for
three- to six year-olds; ski school for six- to 12 year-olds; and a teenage
programme including evening activities ranging from ice skating to pizza
parties.
Adult beginners might do better on the smaller Buttermilk mountain, which
lies just outside Aspen town and also offers highly rated childrens'
programmes (from the age of three). Buttermilk is such a benign mountain to
learn on that the ski school guarantees that absolute beginners will ski
from to bottom in just three days' instruction or get their Dollars 99 fee
back.
The design of Snowmass village also makes it attractive for families. The
25-year-old village is hardly scenic, but planning regulations have kept
building heights down, so it is not the visual eyesore of some modern US and
European resorts. Its few hotels and large number of 'condos' ( apartment
buildings) are on or very near the slopes, so that most visitors can ski to
their accommodation.
Snowmass is not perfect. One of its biggest failings is the lack of a
separate area for the childrens' school, which means that tiny tots share
the main village skiing thoroughfare with everyone else.
And the Snowmass village centre, a glorified shopping mall, is devoid of
atmosphere and nightlife. But there is plenty of that in Aspen, and plenty
of babysitters on hand to relieve those couples capable of rocking the night
away after a hard day's skiing - and parenting.

THERE IS much more at stake at Twickenham this afternoon than whether
Scotland can beat England in the 100th Calcutta Cup match between them and
win the Triple Crown of the Five Nations championship. The sub-text is this:
which of the two captains, Gavin Hastings of Scotland and Will Carling of
England, has the better game? The one who comes out on top is likely to be
named captain of the British Lions when the party to tour New Zealand is
announced later this month.
When the championship started in January, Carling was clear favourite. He
had led England to victory in 24 of 31 matches. Under him, England had won
two successive grand slams, were favourites to win a third, and had reached
the final of the 1991 World Cup. Carling, just 27, seemed to have it all
going for him.
Hastings, on the other hand, was the newly-appointed leader of Scotland
following the retirement of David Sole. After 41 appearances for his
country, during which he had scored 10 tries and nearly 400 points, his
abilities as a player were not in doubt. But he was untested as an
international captain.
How things change. England scraped home against France and then blew their
grand slam chance by losing to Wales at Cardiff. Suddenly, doubts were
raised about both the England team and Carling's suitability to lead the
Lions.
While this was going on, Scotland and Hastings thumped Ireland, lost
narrowly in Paris and then trounced Wales. Hastings, who missed five kicks
out of six against France, landed five penalties against Wales.
Carling and Hastings are bachelors, dashing and fearsome men who play rugby
as if to a script by John Buchan. Hastings thunders in from full back as
often as he can, relishing the opportunity to throw his 15-stone frame at
the opposition. Carling is lighter on his feet (he weighs just over 14
stone), very fast over 20 metres and has the upper body strength of a
wrestler.
Hastings, who is three years older and was first capped in 1986, one year
before Carling, has captained almost every team he has played in - Watson's
College, Cambridge University, London Scottish, the Barbarians. But, then,
so has Carling - Sedbergh school, England Schools, Durham University.
When it comes to deciding the captaincy of the Lions, two voices will carry
special weight. The first is that of Ian McGeechan, the Scottish coach who
also will coach the tourists.
'Gavin is very confident and very secure and positive in what he is trying
to do,' says McGeechan. 'Temperamentally, he is very sound. Because of his
size, he is someone we can work off. He can join the line well but, most of
all, he is good under the high ball. He has an outstanding reputation
world-wide; and if there is one thing he has done well this season, it is to
draw the new players in with the old players.
'I was pleased about that. I thought he was the right sort of person for the
role of captain, but there were those who said that he was not very
impressive as a club captain and, therefore, wondered why he should be made
captain of his country.
'To my mind, captaining one's club and one's country are two very different
jobs and I did not think you would know how he would respond until he was
given the job. His performances this year have got progressively better.'
Carling was first appointed captain when he was 22 and the youngest member
of the England team. It is easy to imagine the shafts of scorn that were
directed his way by some of the experienced forwards. Carling, after all,
was a fresh-faced squirt: public school, middle-class, officer material and,
to cap it all, a back, someone who did not get his knees dirty or soil his
hands.
He had to win his spurs with some of the hard-nosed members of his team and
Paul Ackford, the former England second-row forward, suggested as much when
he said not so long ago: 'Will is a good captain now.' The implication was
that, once, he was not. Carling's good looks, his success and his ability to
generate money have unleashed the green-eyed monster in many.
You could say that Carling is too smooth by three-quarters. He has, however,
a remarkable record. 'He is the most successful captain in international
rugby,' says Geoff Cooke, the England team chief who will manage the Lions.
Cooke was responsible for making Carling skipper in 1988, and has said it
was one of the best decisions he ever made. But he admitted: 'Eyebrows were
raised at the time. He was a newcomer to the team but we were looking for
continuity. We had lost several captains in quick succession and we wanted
someone who would hold his place.
'Rob Andrew was one candidate. Dean Richards was another and perhaps Brian
Moore as well. We looked at them all and came up with Will. He has to be
able to handle the off-the-field stuff as well.'
McGeechan and Cooke agree that a captain 'must have credibility among the
players' (to use McGeechan's phrase) - something which has not always been
the case on Lions' tours. 'You cannot earn respect as a captain unless you
first of all have it as a captain,' says Cooke.
So, will it be Carling or Hastings for the Lions? The choice is unenviable.
The sole blessing is that, for once, British rugby has two such good players
and captains from which to choose.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Sport: A law unto themselves - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCCER fans, officials, and even players and coaches agree that their game
is not what it was. Yet every time Fifa, world soccer's governing body,
tries to solve the problems by tweeking the laws, the response is outrage
from those fans, officials, players and coaches. Fifa is ruining the good
old game, they cry.
Its recent obsession with the laws dates from the 1990 World Cup finals. The
competition is Fifa's pride and joy. In Italy, Argentina reached the final
after winning only two of their six games in normal play (they won their
quarter-final and semi-final on penalty shoot-outs). On the way, they scored
only five goals and accumulated 20 yellow cards and one red card. In the
final, they barely attacked.
The balance of the game had tipped too far in favour of defence.
Furthermore, Fifa's statistics showed that, during the finals, the ball was
in play for an average of just over 50 minutes a game and sometimes much
less; far too low.
Fifa decided to act. As is so often the case, though, the effects of its
attempted reforms have been rather less dramatic than expected. Both Fifa
and its critics have under-estimated the wit and resilience of players and
coaches.
The first change was a law introduced last season which meant defenders who
stopped a goal attempt by foul play would be shown the red card.
Sendings-off in the English league rose 21 per cent, from 202 to 245 - or
just one extra offence punished every 47 games. There was little noticeable
change in the quality and style of play.
By last August, professionals had something else to moan about. Fifa had
made it illegal for goalkeepers to pick up back passes. This change was
intended, says Fifa's Andreas Herren, to eliminate time-wasting and to force
defenders to try to create attacks.
Despite its good intentions, the change drew predictable criticism. One is
that - heaven forbid] - it forces goalkeepers to play football. Another,
common in England, is that it has speeded a game that was too fast already.
But this was Fifa's intention.
In any case, it depends what you mean by 'fast.' In English soccer, nobody
is running any faster: they were at top speed already. There are just fewer
gaps in the helter-skelter.
An amateur referee told me that the back pass penalises defenders when there
is no foul play: but the same could be said of off-side and the rules that
limit goalkeepers to four steps with the ball.
He also said that while he was happy to see the long back pass eliminated,
it was unfair to remove a defender's only option when facing his goal in
tight situations. In truth, the sight of highly-paid professionals making
idiots of themselves has added greatly to the joy of soccer this season.
Fifa is still not happy. Its international board met last Saturday in
Hertfordshire, England, to kick around the idea of replacing throw-ins with
kick-ins. Afterwards, Sepp Blatter, Fifa's general secretary, admitted
disarmingly that he did not have a clue what effect this change might have.
Herren says Fifa have made no final decision on whether kick-ins will be
direct or if players can be offside from them. It proposes to experiment
with the change in two youth tournaments. If it works, there will be another
trial in the Hungarian league. If not, it will be dropped, which is why the
whingers are moaning now. They may not have the opportunity later.
Purists blame the proposal (like so many things) on the Americans, even
though the change will not affect the 1994 World Cup in the US. Anyone who
has taken Americans to soccer games will know that one thing they always ask
is: 'If it's football, why do the players throw the ball in?' Good question.
The answer is that, originally, the ball was kicked in; the rule was changed
to limit the range. That is why the mechanics of the throw-in are so
complicated. There are amateur teams without a single player able to throw
in the ball legally, and foul throws are irritatingly common even at the
highest levels. Now that Fifa wants to find extra ways of getting the ball
into the goalmouth, restoring the kick is a logical move.
Critics complain that a kick-in would 'devalue a corner.' But the goal
standard is soccer's only meaningful currency. In any case, English soccer
is packed already with players who can hurl throw-ins 30 yards into the
goalmouth. The truth is that this reform would have far less effect than
critics suggest.
Meanwhile, the Argentinians collected all those cards in Italy by persistent
foul play and Fifa has not addressed that problem. Defenders can still give
attackers a good kicking and get away with it.
The laws demand that the referee must be a mind-reader. He must assess a
player's 'intent' to commit a foul. Defenders have become masters of the
'unintentional' collision. In practice, referees are often prepared to judge
by appearances.
David Elleray, a top referee, suggests that the laws should make it a foul
'if a player makes contact with an opponent without or before making contact
with the ball.' That might eliminate some of the bone-crunching,
tendon-severing collisions that some consider one of the more attractive
elements of British soccer. It would, however, give attackers a better
chance of making it through a defence, through a match or even through a
season, in one piece.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Motoring: Real stars do outshine those with facelifts -
Geneva's talk of the town has stayed away
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are so many genuinely new models, as distinct from mature but
facelifted ones, at Geneva's Salon International de l'Automobile this week
that picking the star is a problem.
Is it Ford's Mondeo, Citroen's Xantia, Peugeot's 306 or the Opel Corsa? Or
even a new and seductive Aston Martin DB7?
If money and sheer size were the only criteria, the star would be a one-off
Rolls-Royce convertible that weighs in at 3.5 tonnes, measures 21 ft (6.3
metres) long and can be yours, squire, for just Pounds 2.1m. Yes, 2.1m
pounds sterling, not dollars or marks, is the price of this over-egged
monster with a front end like that of the late and unlamented 1975 Camargue
two-door, arguably the worst car Rolls-Royce ever made.
If you fancy something a little nimbler, how about a V12, 500 hp, four-wheel
driven Bugatti EB112 four-door which, with a top speed of about 200 mph (322
kph), is claimed to be the world's fastest saloon car? This is a joint
effort between Bugatti Automobili and Italdesign.
It looks remarkably like the Kensington, a V12-engined Jaguar concept by
Italdesign's Giorgetto Giugiaro. This car - a genuine runner, not a mock-up
 -caused a sensation at Geneva in 1990 but little has been heard of it
since.
Is the Pounds 175,000 Bugatti a technological masterpiece or a hostage to
fortune? It depends what role you see for the motor car in a future
dominated by radar camera-enforced speed limits and concern for the
environment.
Back in the real world, a probable star of the show would be the
Mercedes-Benz C-class - if only it were there. This is the car that will
succeed the 190, the best-selling model ever to wear the three-pointed star.
The C-class had been expected to make a Geneva debut but, having issued
pictures and some details a week or so ago, Mercedes-Benz seems to have felt
there was no need to display the car at the salon.
It will be at the Frankfurt show in September, three months after going on
sale in Germany and other left-hand drive markets. Britons will see it at
London's Motorfair in October, by which time right-hand drive cars may be in
British showrooms.
Citroen and Opel think differently from Mercedes-Benz. They, too, leaked
information about the new Xantia and Corsa well before their media launches
last month. Yet, both made their new cars the centre of their stands in
Geneva.
Even so, the C-class is a major talking point there. Although only 1.5 in (4
cm) longer than the 190, it is said to be much roomier and more comfortable
and to come with an air-bag as standard on the driver's side.
Buyers will have a choice of four multi-valve petrol engines (1.8-litre, 122
hp; two-litre, 136 hp; 2.2-litre, 150 hp; and 2.8-litre, 197 hp) and two new
diesels (2.2-litre, 95 hp and 2.5-litre, 112 hp). These are the world's
first diesels with four valves per cylinder.
Although the proof, as ever, will be in the driving, the C-class is likely
to become the benchmark car in its category. That is what the 190 has been
for the past 11 years, during which more than 2m have been sold, 72,000 of
them in Britain.
The General Motors' Opel Corsa, which I drove in Spain last week, is an
attractive small car - or, rather, two small cars. Because the three- and
five-door versions look so different, it is hard to credit they share the
same platforms, power trains and suspensions. When the 17-model Corsa range
 -which replaces the Nova - goes on sale in Britain this spring, there will
be 1.2-litre, 1.4-litre and 1.6-litre petrol-engined versions and two
1.5-litre diesels, one of them turbo-charged.
All Corsas bristle with safety and security items, like seat belts that
tighten automatically in a crash and side-impact protection beams. Door
deadlocks are available now; a driver's airbag will be by the year's end.
Of the four I drove, my favourite was the 1.4-litre, 82 hp GLS petrol model
 -but only by a very short head from the 67 hp TD turbo-diesel, which has an
exhaust catalyser to make it super-clean. They rode like big cars, not
super-minis, on Andalucia's best and worst roads. And they proved - as has
Nissan's Micra - that buyers of small, cheap cars can now enjoy the
quietness and refinement once found only in large, expensive ones.
A 109 hp, 16-valve Corsa 1.6i was a rousing performer, smooth on the
motorway, nimble on bends but a bit knobbly on granite setts.
These are early days to be talking about Car of the Year 1994, as votes will
not be cast until late autumn. But it could well be a four-horse race
between Mondeo and Corsa, Xantia and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. If so, my money
probably will be on the Mondeo.
Apart from the three main Geneva debutantes (Mondeo, Corsa and Xantia),
Peugeot is displaying its 309 replacement, the 306, first seen last month at
Amsterdam Show. And Nissan's Spanish-built Terrano II, which also will be
marketed by Ford as the Maverick, also makes its bow.
This recreational, on/off-road estate, with three or five doors, has
selectable four-wheel drive and a 2.4-litre petrol or 2.7-litre turbo-diesel
engine.
It will, no doubt, perform as capably as any of the present generation of
high-slung 4x4s on the rare occasions it is taken seriously off-road. But
Nissan's aim has been to produce a civilised alternative to a conventional,
up-to-seven-seat family estate car, that will pull horse trailers and will
not allow owners to look foolish by getting stuck in muddy car parks.
Both the Terrano II and its Ford Maverick clone enter Britain's burgeoning
4x4 market early in summer.
Aston Martin lifted the veil on the DB7, its first really new car in more
than 20 years. In contrast to the two-ton, V8-engined, dinosaur Aston
Martins, the DB7 is of the same bloodline as the DB6 that died in 1971,
although entirely up to date. It looks a proper, hard-topped 2+2 sports
coupe.
More importantly, massive pulling power from low revolutions promises easy
driveability in traffic. With a five-speed manual gearbox or four-speed
automatic, and standard air-conditioning, the DB7 will sell in Britain for
under Pounds 80,000 from early 1994.
Before that, Ferrari's new 348 Spider, shown for the first time at Geneva,
will be available for less than Pounds 80,000 to UK buyers this summer. A
strictly two-seat car with a 3.4-litre, four-cam V8, it is motoring's
forbidden fruit personified.
The Salon International de l'Automobile is being held at Palexpo, adjoining
Geneva airport, until March 14.

ONE SUSPECTS that Ferdinand Magellan would have been the first to hand over
Pounds 693 for a round-the-world air ticket. The Portuguese explorer, whose
bold foresight led to the first circumnavigation of the globe in 1521, paid
a far higher price. Before he had completed his voyage, Magellan became
embroiled in a dispute with rowdy islanders who relieved him of his life.
Modern-day adventurers have it far easier. For a modest Pounds 693,
Trailfinders (tel: 071-938-3366) can send you circumnavigating via Hong
Kong, Bangkok, Sydney, San Francisco and New Orleans.
Flights depart from five UK airports. Tickets, which must be booked by May,
are open for one year.
According to STA (tel: 071-937-1733), there is no such thing as a standard
round-the-world itinerary. Many people fly to Australia via south-east Asia,
then across the Pacific to North America before returning to Europe. But one
need not be tethered to such norms.
One could follow a similar route in the opposite direction, or call in on
Africa or South America along the way. Travellers with time on their hands
may elect to intersperse flights with overland sections, say Bangkok to
Singapore or Perth to Sydney.
Here are two STA itineraries to give you some idea:
London-Rio-Auckland-Sydney-Singapore-London (Pounds 989); or
London-LA-Honolulu-Tonga-Samoa-Auckland -Sydney-Singapore-London (Pounds
836).
Even these are humdrum in the grand scheme of things. For little extra one
can add on destinations such as Vietnam, the Gallapagos islands or Beijing.
Even Mongolia and Madagascar are within reach.
Before booking, here are a few cautionary tips:
Decide how much time you have. Magellan's expedition took two years; yours
should last at least a month, although a colleague of mine compressed five
transglobal destinations into a confusing 11 days.
If your time is fairly limited, do not attempt too much. Your global
experience could end up a saga of airport lounges and hurried city tours.
Three or four days is a sensible minimum for each stop, enabling you to
adapt to time changes.
Plan ahead. If you are stopping in Delhi, ask yourself why. Can you see the
Taj Mahal in the 24 hours you have allotted for India? (You probably cannot,
and certainly should not try.) Is Tahiti fearfully expensive? Is Lima safe?
Can you find accommodation in Zanzibar? Is Easter Island nice at Easter?
Most people will find it best to book hotels in advance, avoiding the agony
of spending jet-lagged hours in search of accommodation. You may well be
able to arrange hotel discounts in conjunction with your ticket.
Multiple stopovers mean multiple visas and multiple headaches. Put in your
applications in good time. Some embassies and consulates insist on keeping
your passport for several days, though many now run an overnight service.
Most travel agents can help with visas, or contact Visa Service (tel:
071-833-2709).
Take out travel insurance. Without it, a lost ticket usually means buying
yourself a replacement. Watch out, too, that overzealous check-in staff do
not remove more than one ticket docket at a time. You could find yourself in
Guangzhou airport explaining that the ticket stub for your next leg is in a
dustbin at Singapore airport.
Other agencies you might try are: Bridge the World (tel: 071-911-0900);
Quest Worldwide (081-547-3322), and Travel Mood (071-258-0280). The latter
offers around-the-world business class fares at below Pounds 2,000.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Travel: The river roads of the rainforest - Boats are best
when exploring parts of Malaysia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL J WOODS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANCIENT outboard motor revved loudly, thrashing at the surface of the
turbulent water so that the long boat quickly lost way against the immutable
force of the current. With great calm the steersman brought the stern almost
against the steep bank where the water was dark and deep and the vegetation
hung over the channel.
Ducking to avoid thick leaves and branches, he dipped the propeller into the
river and turned on the power. Once more we surged forward over a shoal of
stones and into the deeper pool above. Another obstacle had been overcome
and we powered up the River Tembeling through the soaring trees of the
Malaysian rainforest.
The Tembeling is the main route into Malaysia's largest national park, Taman
Nagara, which means, simply, national park. Covering an area of 4,343 square
kilometres of virgin rainforest 130m years old, the park is largely
inaccessible except via rivers. The journey upstream from Kuala Tembeling to
the park headquarters and the new Taman Nagara Resort at Kuala Tahan takes
about three hours depending on the water level.
The long boats thrust powerfully upstream past small riverside settlements
perched on the bank-tops high above the normal river level, for in the
monsoon the river can rise by more than 70 metres, as the line on the wall
at the park headquarters testifies.
I saw a graphic illustration of this rise and fall along one of the
Tembeling's tributaries leading deep into the park. Jammed high above in the
branches of a tree was a trunk probably 10m long and 1m across.
Taman Nagara Resort is incongruous in the remote and wild context of virgin
rainforest. Its rooms, in individual and traditional Malay buildings, are
comfortable, but the city hotel-style restaurant, 24-hour reception and
banqueting hall are incompatible with a jungle setting.
I ate, instead, in the fairy-lit cafes set up on the river beach opposite,
whistling for a boat to carry me across the black swirling waters and
stumbling up the stony beach in the dark. One night I joined a group of
forest guides and national park staff for a celebratory meal, clumsily
balling rice with delicious pieces of river fish and spicy chicken direct
from hand to mouth.
From the park headquarters a variety of trails led into the forest. Some are
short with numbered points of interest, others are longer and take you to
viewpoints or mineral licks. One of them is the route to the highest
mountain on peninsular Malaysia, a seven-day trek. I chose a short route as
a taster and plunged into the trees along a damp, narrow path.
The noise took me completely by surprise - a loud, endlessly repetitive
backing of hums, buzzes, whines, drones and purrs enlivened, now and then,
by rising and falling bells and whoops. It went on constantly, night and
day, a cacophony of insects, frogs, occasional birds and even gibbons.
Somehow this barrage of sound, together with the occasional leech looping
rapidly across the leaves of the forest floor at the slightest sniff of a
meal, produced an atmosphere of malevolence.
The problem with the rainforest is that the action is many floors up in the
penthouse while you are stuck in the dank basement. It is only along the
corridors cut by the rivers and in clearings such as those carved out for
villages and the park headquarters that wildlife becomes apparent.
Early one morning I fruitlessly searched the grounds of the new resort for
some of the 20 bird species which the leaflet told me could commonly be seen
there. I spotted just two, although one was the glorious southern pied
hornbill, its beak adorned with a huge creamy casque. There were also
long-tailed macaque monkeys, raiding the builders' houses for food, and
several species of squirrel.
I spent one night in a hide overlooking a mineral lick. Here half-a-dozen of
us kept vigil armed with powerful torches to flick on at the slightest sound
of a visitor. We were alerted by a noise like munching cornflakes, and there
in the spotlight was a bi-coloured animal, black at front and back with a
broad white belt around its middle, a tapir.
Its early arrival promised well for the rest of the night but it was a
promise not to be fulfilled. Although the tapir came and went several times,
nothing else turned up.
An alternative is to visit the animals themselves, so the next day we
crawled through a grubby cave in search of bats. There were two species, a
large fruit-eating bat and a much smaller insectivorous horseshoe bat. Both
were hanging in great numbers from the grey ceiling and festooning the rocky
walls.
This was no place for the phobic. Along with the bats, a large toad sat
darkly in the stream below while a white cave racer with a brilliant red
tongue, a bat-eating snake, slid silently around the walls, insinuating its
body into cracks and slithering from crevice to crevice.
The Malaysian jungle is home to one of the three species of great ape, the
orang-utan, though I had to fly to the orang-utan rehabilitation centre at
Sepilok, in the state of Sabah, to see these. Here young orangs, orphaned as
infants or taken from the wild as pets, are re-introduced to life in the
rainforest. A number of learning stages sees them wise enough to live freely
in the forest, returning to a feeding area for supplementary rations of
bananas and milk, a diet which is supposed to encourage them to forage for
more interesting food out of sheer boredom. Even when there are no primates
to be seen, Sepilok offers an ideal opportunity to appreciate the beauty and
majesty of the rainforest.

FT  06 MAR 93 / How To Spend It: Tip the wink, hats are back - Stella
Shamoon meets a hatter who sees brighter times ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STELLA SHAMOON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HATS, according to Richard Stephenson, top hatter at James Lock in London's
St James's, are back in fashion with the young - well, the younger, at
least.
'The average age of our customers has dropped in the last ten years from the
middle 50s to 60s to late 40s, and it is still falling,' says Stephenson,
who has spent almost 40 years in the family-controlled business. Lock,
founded in 1676, has long been renowned as the supplier of essential
headgear for riding, hunting, shooting and fishing to the likes of Prince
Phillip and the landed gentry.
'We also now have more customers associated with young people: rock star
Eric Clapton has been in twice - first for felt hats for himself, then back
again with a friend for felt hats to send to the US. Paul McCartney is a
fan, so is his wife Linda, and Ringo Starr is also a customer,' says
Stephenson
'Fashion in hats is cyclical. The generation whose fathers wore hats were
the 1960s rebels who said 'If Dad wears one that's not for me, that's old
hat' - if you'll pardon the pun. Now there are few long-haired men around.
Young men are conservative with a small c, rather dandyish, and like to
dress formally and to wear the right thing  - that's good for business.'
Show business, too, is good for Lock's trade. Apart from the ageing Beatles'
penchant for rabbit fur felt hats and fine tweeds with which to cover their
greying mop-tops, films such as Bugsy, starring Warren Beatty, and other
period epics - Brideshead Revisited and Chariots of Fire for example -
inspired a cult in hats among younger men.
Lock has occupied the same period Grade II freehold site since 1764 and the
shop has hardly altered since Lord Nelson drew up there in a carriage to buy
the hat he was wearing when felled during the battle of Trafalgar. 'We were
upset that our shop was only Grade II until we discovered that Grade I was
reserved for buildings such as Buckingham Palace and Blenheim.'
Lock's traditional customer base is 95 per cent male and heavily weighted
towards the county set and what Stephenson delicately dubs 'the new gentry,'
embracing show business personalities and style-conscious foreigners -
notably Milanese, New Yorkers and Parisians whose purchases of
quintessentially English headgear accounts for 55 per cent of Lock's annual
sales.
Turnover was Pounds 900,000 last year and Stephenson is targetting Pounds 1m
this year. He is keeping profits under his hat, as it were, but makes no
secret of the fact that in common with other West End purveyors of luxury
goods, Lock's mark-up on cost is 100 per cent.
There are ten full time employees at the shop, including himself and the
export director. The annual salary bill runs between Pounds 150,000 and
Pounds 200,000, with advertising of Pounds 16,000 a year on top. The shop is
worth up to Pounds 1m, with extra space to requirements rented out at some
Pounds 14,000 a year. Meanwhile, the brand's value is inestimable.
The business is owned equally by the Stephensons and another family, the
Macdonalds. There are two brothers from each family on the board together
with the export director, Michael Sydney. So far none has made a fortune
from Lock but it affords a decent, gentle living with the promise of riches
one day, once the full potential of its brand is unlocked.
Stephenson has his eye on the women - and the military. There has been a
conscious effort to attract more stylish women into the shop with
'millinery' as opposed to essential headgear. Lock's sales to women are a
big growth sector of the business.
There is no formal design team. Stephenson and Michael Sydney 'do our bit in
putting together new thoughts.' The result is there have been more new
styles in Lock's shop in the past five years than in the last 25.
Prices run at some Pounds 180 for ready-made felt hats - a custom-made one
would hardly cost more at about Pounds 195 - to nearly Pounds 300 for a
custom-made riding cap. Hand-made silk top hats are Pounds 225. Virtually
all Lock's stock, which is made by trusted specialists to Lock's
specification, is hand finished.
Meanwhile, there are constant requests for a 'complete overhaul' of existing
hats at Pounds 25 to Pounds 30 a time. If menswear is in the vanguard of
recession, then hats come top in terms of non-essential purchases in most
people's books. But, confides the jovial, cigar-puffing Stephenson: 'Our
export side has been doing well, particularly in Europe, even when the pound
was stronger. We plan to build on that.'
Stephenson's well-kept secret is a pretty young milliner called Rachel
Trevor-Morgan who is Lock's tenant and happens to produce delectable, dressy
little hand-made hats. Trevor-Morgan's confections are now displayed
incongruously among Lock's tweedy sensible styles for women.
Trevor-Morgan, who has had her own business for two and a half years after
training with Graham Smith and Phillip Somerville, says: 'It is boom time
for the hat industry. There are a lot more young designers coming into the
business, which was greatly boosted by Princess Diana and the panache with
which she wears her hats. Younger women are wearing hats - not just as grand
occasion accessories, but for dramatic emphasis to their faces and outfits.'
Trevor-Morgan's hottest number this season is the tall crowned riding hat
(strictly NOT for riding in) at about Pounds 200. Her crunchy straws,
raffia-like in texture, go for Pounds 220.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Reds, whites and blues - Why a varsity match
gave Jancis Robinson that sinking feeling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OXBRIDGE rivalry is supposed to run deepest on the river Thames between
Putney and Mortlake, isn't it? But this year's Boat Race can hardly be more
acrimonious than the Oxford v Cambridge Wine Tasting Match held in London on
Tuesday.
This, the 40th annual such blind tasting, had all the usual hallmarks of
varsity confrontation: Cambridge accusing Oxford of weighting the boat with
too many graduates; women in a minority; and a certain amount of
exhibitionism. The cocktail was headily spiked, however, with a few
distinctly 1990s ingredients: gratuitous legal wrangling, the strong whiff
of hard-edged commercialism, and calculated yobbism.
The Cambridge captain, a law student currently choosing between offers of
employment from four investment banks, was proud of the contract he had
spent 'hundreds of pounds worth of faxes and paper' drawing up between his
team and the competition's sponsors, Pol Roger champagne.
'We're the first team to realise the commercial value of all this,' he said
proudly, nodding at his fellow competitors slurping Pol Roger wines around
the celebratory lunch table at London's Oxford &amp; Cambridge Club.
'Yeah,' said his vice captain, an American who declared, not entirely
coherently, that he could be as rude as he liked since next week he would be
at Yale, 'teaching scumbags European History'.
This charming fellow, seated just two places away from the the event's
organiser, Bill Gunn, the mild-mannered Master of Wine who represents Pol
Roger in England, noisily (and erroneously) laid into the quality of the
champagne being hosed into our glasses. The vice captain boasted that
Cambridge had talked about offering the sponsorship deal to Bollinger, its
preferred champagne house, and that it was only by agreeing to the lawyer
captain's strict terms and conditions that Pol Roger had secured the
privilege of laying on this competition and lunch.
With an eye to relatively extensive press coverage last year (helped
enormously by New York Times wine writer Frank Prial's entirely coincidental
presence in London SW1 that day), the Cambridge captain had decided to
polish up the participants' image.
In order to present a less privileged and more 'caring' image, he had
insisted that Pol Roger changed the prize from champagne to a cheque for
Pounds 1,000 for a charity of the winner's choice.
No, he had not actually thought about which charity, which was perhaps just
as well since Cambridge lost, by 744 points to 855 (out of a possible
1,440), in spite of fielding one young Australian who dropped only 12 points
out of a maximum of 120 in the white wine paper. The captain/business
manager had clearly put more energy into the subclauses than into coaching
his team. Younger Cambridge tasters talked wistfully of how much they could
have learnt by tasting together and sharing impressions before the big day,
a process assiduously encouraged at Oxford.
While Cambridge fielded the regulation stubble-wearer with FT folded
ostentatiously into a Samuel Beckett paperback, Oxford's team was long on
neatly dressed mathematicians and democracy (joint captains and a positive
bias in favour of women).
The opposing captains nearly came to blows across the table when the
question of graduate participation was broached. 'But our graduates are
relatively inexperienced tasters', was Oxford's defence of the maturity of
its team.
Oh and the wines themselves? Forgive me, they seemed rather peripheral to
the event. A New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (1991 from Selaks) was spotted by
almost everyone, even the judges - myself and Hugh Johnson - along with a
full throttle Australian Chardonnay (1990 from Tim Knappstein) and a mature
rioja, Vina Ardanza Reserva 1985.
Best wines there were probably Ch Leoville Las-Cases 1985 (Cambridge had
contracted Pol Roger to lay on some smart wines) and Mascarello's Barbaresco
Marcarini 1985 (Pounds 17.99 from Winecellars of London SW18).
The worst wine, by far, was an unexpectedly oxidised Meursault, Narvaux 1989
from Boyer-Martinot, which some participants loved. This did not surprise me
one little bit.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Food and Drink: Learning at lunch - How Nicholas Lander ate
and judged five lunches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I KNOW that there are some people out there who, perhaps for commercial
reasons, eat lunch out every day of the week. But I have never done so. When
I was a restaurateur, lunch was one course at 3pm and now that I am a
reviewer, I try to space out my pleasures.
That is until last week when I judged a new culinary competition, Prix des
Deux Cartes, devised by wine importers Domaines, Drouhin &amp; Associates. This
challenges chefs and sommeliers to create a menu and choose four wines to
match and enhance the food. There was a substantial reward for all who
reached the necessary standard.
The five judges were: Michel Roux, of the Waterside Inn, Bray; Charles
Metcalfe, wine writer; Bill Baker, wine merchant; Victor Ceserani, whose
book Practical Cooking has sold 1.5m copies since 1962 and is the 'bible'
for any catering college student; and myself. We met in December to judge 70
written entries, without knowing their origins. Surprisingly, we eliminated
all the London entries at this stage, including The Dorchester, The Inn on
the Park and Les Saveurs.
The five finalists were: Burgh Island Hotel, South Devon (tel: 0548-810514);
the Waterside Inn, Bray (0628-20691), although Roux neither knew it was
being entered nor judged the meal; Lucknam Park, Wiltshire (0225-742777);
One Devonshire Gardens, Glasgow (041-339-2001) and The Old Swan Hotel,
Harrogate (0423-500055).
All five achieved high marks with various food and wine combinations. Burgh
Island overcame the problem of having to prepare John Dory on a Monday by
bringing the fish, landed on Sunday in Newlyn, Cornwall, to London by train.
The Scottish entrants drove eight hours in a hired van with their own
cutlery, crockery and tartan ribbons for the napkins. They also brought
their own ingredients; a 14lb wild salmon from Loch Lomond - delicious with
a Joseph Drouhin Rully Blanc 1990 - and a saddle of one-year-old roe deer
shot in Aberdeenshire and hung for 12 days.
The Waterside Inn executed a cassolette of scallops and langoustines
memorable for the quality of the fish and the flavours of the vegetable
nage. Lucknam Park dazzled with its amuses-gueules - chilled Helford oysters
and scallops with a pepper confit - as well as its first course, tortellini
of jerusalem artichokes with a truffle butter sauce.
The Old Swan's cooking was considerably enhanced by Mark Kirby, a young man
who had joined the hotel three weeks earlier and been rapidly promoted
because its sommelier had fallen ill.
But at the end of every meal, when the chef and sommelier joined us for
coffee, I and the other judges felt disappointed. This was partly because
only the team from Glasgow (its sommelier is called Johnnie Walker) had
approached the competition scientifically and sat down to test the food and
wines at one sitting.
The others tested haphazardly and made silly mistakes. The sommelier from
Lucknam Park tried to 'create a contrast' by matching a rich chocolate
pudding with a rare vin de paille 1982 from Chapoutier. He succeeded only in
creating what fellow judges Baker and Metcalfe described as 'a disaster'.
The Waterside Inn's team produced a savarin of pears and ginger that was
overwhelmingly sweet for the late harvest Gewurztraminer 1990 from New
Zealand. Only Burgh House found a good dessert and wine combination by
serving a simple apple pastry with a delicious 1986 Sauternes Chateau
Rieussec.
More seriously, although the first courses were excellent, in four out of
the five meals the main courses and the wines chosen were just not well
matched. Had I been a paying customer I might have felt more than
disappointment.
These feelings were articulated by Victor Ceserani. He began with a
compliment, then dished out the constructive criticism, based on 50 years in
professional kitchens. Do not put shallots and chives in your amuses-gueules
 -leave the customers' palate clean for the first course; do not get carried
away with the reduction of your stocks or they become too heavy; do not
overdo the ratio of stuffing to meat, it should be 50:50; and, for two of
the chefs, a warning against putting too much sauce underneath the main
course.
The competition left five British chefs and sommeliers more aware of the
potential and pitfalls of matching food and wine. Three teams, from the
Waterside Inn, One Devonshire Gardens and Lucknam Park will learn more on
the trips they have won to European vineyards. And, after a week, it has
left five judges just a little bit plumper.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Cookery: Abstain and be merry at Lent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW PEOPLE now observe the once-common custom of abstaining from meat on
weekdays in Lent. But the idea of eating less meat and more vegetables
during this period is far from penitential, particularly if you seek out two
of the best vegetables now in season: sea kale and chard.
Sea kale is native to the UK - arguably, the only vegetable that truly is
British. The Victorians adored it and served it with great ceremony, for
they regarded it as worthy of serving in its own right rather than an
adjunct to meat.
They steamed sea kale whole, wrapped it in a damask napkin and laid it in a
silver dish. It was eaten in the fingers with a melted butter sauce for
dipping. Although sea kale can be used for gratins, soups and other dishes,
this simple vegetable treatment probably remains the best way to enjoy it.
Because sea kale is grown in forcing pots, the blanched stalks are long and
spindly, topped with embryonic, lilac-fringed leaves. It looks a little like
celery but, happily, it lacks the tonsil-tangling strings that run through
much celery on sale today.
The texture is crisp and juicy and the flavour is delicately nutty, with
only a faint background note of brassica that harks back to the plant's wild
seashore cabbage origins.
You will find sea kale on sale now at Waitrose and Sainsbury. About eight
minutes' steaming is all it needs if young and tender.
Chard has not made it into the supermarkets yet, so far as I know, but
specialist greengrocers stock it (or should, at least, get it to order from
wholesale markets). Most of it is imported from France and Italy.
Chard is as big and bold as sea kale is pale and retiring. It is a handsome
plant with dark green leaves and ivory ribs (although some varieties are
ruby red). Basically, it is a sort of coarse-leafed spinach cultivated for
the sake of its ribs.
I have bought some splendid examples during the past few weeks. Often, the
leaves weigh well over half a pound each and they may measure more than 12in
from tip to base, with ribs at least 4in wide.
Sometimes, chard is eaten in its entirety. It is, for example, the main
ingredient of a traditional pie cooked at Easter in Genoa, although modern
recipes tend to replace the chard with artichokes. And in Valtellina last
year, I was introduced to a dish called pizzoccheri: buckwheat noodles with
chard, cheese and potatoes - richly restorative food for cold-weather
eating.
More often, however, the greenery and ribs of chard are cooked and served
separately. The resilient greenery is used frequently to eke out meat in
pates and in southern France there are local recipes in which chard
greenery, meat and batter are combined - to my mind, with varying degrees of
success. I prefer the partnership of greenery and batter alone: chard makes
excellent fritters.
The ribs have a slightly smoky celery taste. They are succulent and juicy,
verging on watery. Like sea kale, they are wolfed down more than willingly
by everyone I have met when sauced with such things as hollandaise; melted
butter seasoned with anchovy, lemon and parsley; Parmesan butter; or butter
with toasted and finely-chopped hazels with cumin.
Both chard and sea kale also make a fine feast when cut into short lengths
and boiled or steamed briefly, then dressed with a tomato cream sauce, or
covered with scalded and seasoned cream, scattered with slivers of St Paulin
or Morbier cheese, and slipped into a hot oven for a few minutes until the
cheese is molten.
CHARD WITH SAUCE AURORE (serves 4)
Sea kale cut into short lengths and blanched can also be served this way.
Ingredients: 1 lb chard ribs;  1/2 lb tomatoes; 1 oz sun-dried tomatoes;
1/4 pt stock; celery salt; a small bay leaf; a slice of onion;  1/4 pt
double cream; a little thyme and oregano; 1 tablespoon each softened butter
and flour mashed together; 1 oz fresh bread crumbs fried in  1/4 oz butter
(optional).
Method: First make the sauce. Chop both fresh and dried tomatoes. Bring them
to boiling point in the stock with a good pinch of celery salt, the bay and
onion. Cover and simmer for five minutes then set aside for half an hour.
Discard the bay and onion. Rub the remaining contents of the pan through a
sieve. Return the mixture to the pan. Stir in the cream and bring to
scalding point, then work in the beurre manie gradually. Season with thyme,
oregano, salt and pepper to taste and simmer briefly to give good
consistency and flavour.
Strip the membrane and any stringy bits from the chard ribs, then cut the
juicy flesh into chunks. Drop them in fast-boiling salted water and cook for
about five minutes or until done to your liking. Drain very thoroughly,
Dress with the sauce and scatter with hot fried crumbs for textural
contrast. If serving this dish in tandem with the chard greenery made into
fritters, the bread crumbs can be omitted.
CHARD FRITTERS (serves 4-6)
The coarse, resilient leaves of spinach beet also can be used for this
recipe. If you use proper tender-leafed spinach, you will need  1/2 lb of
it.
Ingredients:  1/4 lb chard greenery, washed and shredded;  1/4 lb plain
flour (all white or 50/50 wholemeal and white); 2 eggs beaten with a dribble
of olive oil; 1 garlic clove, crushed with salt; nutmeg;  1/4 pt
semi-skimmed milk (or full cream milk and water mixed); olive or peanut oil
for frying; freshly-grated Parmesan cheese for serving.
Method: Make a thick, creamy batter - by hand or using a food processor -
with the flour, eggs and milk. Season with crushed garlic, plenty of nutmeg,
pepper and sea salt. Stir in the greenery and set aside for at least an hour
to marry the flavours. Stir again before use.
Heat oil in a frying pan to a depth of  1/4 in. Add the batter in dollops,
just a few at a time. Space them well apart and flatten them slightly with
the back of a spoon. Cook over moderate heat until crisp and cooked through,
flipping them over once.
Drain the green and gold fritters on a bed of crumpled kitchen paper and
keep hot in the oven - uncovered, or they may turn soggy - while you cook
the rest. Serve with Parmesan for adding at table.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Fashion: Comfort and joy, cashmere has it all wrapped up -
The world's most luxurious textile is now great value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CATCH MANY of the world's foremost designers off (and sometimes on) duty and
what are they wearing? Well, take Giorgio Armani, for example. If it is
winter, nine times out of ten you will find him in an absolutely plain,
classic, navy-blue cashmere sweater.
Donna Karan will probably be sporting one of her own cashmere bodies (you
know the sort of thing - steel grey or oatmeal, lean and simple and doing
away with that bete-noir of the fashionably dressed, the 'vpl' or visible
panty line). Jean Muir is often to be found looking frail and elegant in her
own cashmere line - navy-blue, of course.
Mary Wesley, the novelist, rates cashmere sweaters an essential part of her
wardrobe and, for a lesson in how to sling cashmere artlessly round the
shoulders, take a look at Miranda Richardson in the film Damage. Never mind
the plot; take in Miranda Richardson's wardrobe if you really want to know
how the well-heeled and well-born dress - all soft greys and oatmeals,
understated and simple but effortlessly classy.
Cashmere is one of the all-time desirable fibres - the Rolls-Royce, if you
like, of the fashion world - so it is not surprising that those with the
wherewithal to buy it are so often to be found clad in it. The good news for
the rest of us is that though cashmere will never be cheap, it is now more
accessibly-priced than it has been for many years.
Those who bought cashmere in the high-spending 1980s will remember only too
well how prices spiralled upwards. As the Chinese, who control Mongolia and
thus the chief source of the highest-quality goat fibre, decentralised the
market and flirted with a little uncontrolled free-enterprise, they got
their fingers badly burnt. Mongolian goatherders began selling whatever
fibres they could to whomever would pay most. So high-cost knitwear of
variable quality began to hit world markets just as the recession began to
bite, the Gulf War eroded confidence and tourists stopped being tourists.
Retailers who had become accustomed, rather like British house-owners, to
thinking that their hoard of butter-soft cashmere was an asset that could
only go up and up got a rude awakening when the public seemed to say, as
one, 'enough is enough' and the sweaters on the shelves started gathering
dust.
Today, quality has again become controlled, the flow of imported sweaters of
poor quality has lessened and best of all, prices are at least 20 per cent
down on even a couple of years ago. The result is that in the chic shops in
London's Burlington Arcade women's roll-neck sweaters today sell for about
Pounds 142, whereas two years ago they cost Pounds 40 more. Classic
Professor Higgins cardigans which used to cost Pounds 292 now sell for
Pounds 63 less. And all through the cashmere world the story is repeated.
Good quality cashmere, according to Andrew McRobb, marketing director of
Pringle of Scotland, is easily recognised. It should have a 'slight lustre
and a melt-in-the-hands feel. It should have a softness of touch all over.
Too much material in the seams, particularly inside, can spoil the overall
appeal. And there should be a smooth, not clumpy, finish on the neck.
Desirable, too, is strengthening under the arms.'
Few people dispute that Scottish cashmere is tops - the combination of
selecting only the finest yarns, the water from the burns (used for washing
and treating the yarn) and a design policy based on proper classics meant
that for years their products sold in droves.
But hard times are famously effective for causing even the most solid of
companies to rethink its strategy. These days many of the best Scottish
companies have hired top designers to update their ranges. The result is
cashmere used for such sassy numbers as long sarong skirts, skinny vests,
sweatpants, leggings and all the other essential components of the
fashionable woman's wardrobes.
Names to look out for are Ballantyne (which hired Alastair Blair and Oscar
de la Renta), Jean Muir (who has always loved cashmere and has her own
designs made up in the Borders) and Belinda Robertson (if in Edinburgh visit
her showroom at 22 Palmerston Place).
McGeorge, which is Dawson International's most luxurious label, produces
some wonderfully desirable smoking jackets and heavy-ribbed cardigans for
men. Another good label is TSE Cashmere, which has made a huge effort to
upgrade and stabilise its quality and which manages to deliver cashmere at
prices lower than anybody else. This it does by doing everything itself -
from owning the goat farms in Northern China to combing and spinning the
yarn, as well as manufacturing the finished product.
Part of the secret of its good prices is that it is not trying to do
everything - it has a limited but fashionable range of designs and has pared
colours down to the season's current fashionable shades, not pretending to
offer the wide range that a company such as Pringle might stock.
Devra King is its resident designer and for spring she is combining cashmere
and silk and, for summer, pure silk. Coming up soon is a range based on the
currently hot notion of layering - pure silk 'poor-boy' ribs are topped by
cardigans and vests in various lengths, some cropped, some waist-length,
some extra long. Look out for TSE's six-ply vest with a ribbed front (Pounds
155) and long mid-calf vests (Pounds 299) which can be worn over wide pants
(Pounds 275). No longer just for the pearls and twinset brigade, cashmere
these days is high fashion.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Hedging options
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I BOUGHT my detached bungalow in 1986. A few months later, a new owner
bought the bungalow next door. Both were built about 20 years ago and the
deeds specify that a party hedge shall separate them. The very first owner
of the adjoining property planted a beech hedge along the approximate
boundary line, and this was about 4 ft high in 1986. Since then, the new
neighbour has allowed his side of it to grow to about 7 ft between the back
gardens and 6 ft between those at the front.
What is the legal position about party hedge heights? Can I cut down my
neighbour's half to the original height? Must I notify him of my intention?
Unless the title deeds specify a maximum height for the hedge, you cannot
insist on your neighbour keeping his side of it to any particular height. It
would be a trespass if you were to cut your neighbour's half.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: A guide to CGT
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I AM LOOKING for a suitable guide to capital gains tax. Can you recommend
one?
If you need only simple information on a limited range of CGT rules, then
ask your local tax office for the free catalogue of free pamphlets. Those in
the CGT series which may interest you include CGT4 - Owner-Occupied houses;
CGT13 - The indexation allowance for quoted shares; CGT14 - Capital gains
tax: an introduction; CGT15 - Capital gains tax: a guide for married
couples; CGT16 - Indexation allowance: disposals after 5 April 1988. If you
want a brief but comprehensive guide, then, for Pounds 24.95, there is
Tolley's Capital Gains Tax 1992-93 (ISBN 0 85459 668 2) published by Tolley
Publishing Co. Ltd, 2 Addiscombe Road, Croydon, CR9 5AF (tel. 081-686 9141).
CGT is an intricate and arbitrary tax with scant regard for logic or equity,
so any simple guide must inevitably over-simplify many aspects and skate
round others.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: This wall will fall . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PART OF my property is overlooked by the back wall of a warehouse, about 20
ft high. This wall is beginning to lean at the top and will eventually fall
on to my property.
I have spoken to the owners of the warehouse and asked them to have the wall
repaired. I have also written to them and so has has my solicitor - to no
avail. The council and environmental health department do not wish to know.
I have even written to my insurers, who say they cannot do anything as the
wall does not belong to me.
I am told I cannot repair the wall myself because I do not own it. What can
I do?
Unfortunately, pre-emptive action on your part is not available. It was
correct to write and put the owners of the wall on notice of the special
danger should the wall collapse. Apart from writing again - this time,
direct to the managing director or chairman of the company that owns the
wall - there is no recourse so long as it is wholly within the neighbouring
land.
If, however, the top of the wall is sufficiently out of true to be invading
the air space above your side of the boundary line, you could seek an
injunction in the county court based on the trespass and on the risk that
serious damage will be caused in the future (a quia timet injunction).

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: When it pays to be bold - The
gearing policy of Scottish Mortgage has proved profitable / Investment
Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE WORLD of investment trusts, names can mislead. Although Scottish
Mortgage and Trust is based in Scotland, it has nothing to do with
mortgages. Instead, it is one of the 'big ten' international general trusts
dealing in a range of equity and bond markets round the globe.
The name originated in 1909 when the trust was set up by a firm of lawyers -
an offshoot of which became Baillie Gifford, the Edinburgh-based investment
management group which runs Scottish Mortgage's portfolio. The aim was to
buy fixed-interest securities issued by Far East plantations. But when it
found there were not enough plantations of the right quality to back, it
moved into other fields.
What sets Scottish Mortgage most apart from the other international trusts
is its willingness to take relatively bold decisions over gearing -
borrowing money to invest in shares and other instruments. Gearing makes
sense in the long term, since shares outperform other investments; in the
short term, it can require a strong nerve. When share prices fall,
borrowings still have to be repaid at face value.
The high gearing policy made life difficult for the trust in 1987, as the
graph shows. When the stock market plunged on Black Monday in October that
year, Scottish Mortgage underperformed the FT All-Share index dramatically.
When markets are rising, however, the trust does disproportionately well: it
was second in the international general sector over the year to March 1,
with a gain of 32.1 per cent (mid-market to mid-market with net income
re-invested). Over ten years, it was sixth (out of 17) in the sector, with a
rise of 419.6 per cent.
The trust raised two stepped-interest debentures in the 1980s. One was timed
brilliantly for the start of the bull market in 1982; the other, taken out
in the summer of 1986, was less felicitous.
In 1987, Scottish Mortgage also arranged an Dollars 80m (Pounds 56.3m)
multi-currency facility; that was replaced with a Dollars 75m facility in
1992. But, rather than invest in shares, the trust took advantage of the
'positive yield curve' whereby returns on bonds are higher than short-term
interest rates.
'We reached the view that the mid-1990s would be very favourable for bonds,'
says manager Maxwell Ward. 'There is a near-absence of inflationary
pressures. We perceived that short-term interest rates had already fallen in
the US and Japan without pulling long rates down; we were also on the
threshold of lower short-term rates in Europe.'
So, on top of the other gearing, the trust raised a further Dollars 75m
which it invested in US Treasury bonds. 'We borrowed at 4.9 per cent in
dollars and invested in Treasuries at 7.9 per cent,' says Ward. A similar
view has led the trust to invest Pounds 70m of its short-term borrowings in
gilts.
As of December 31, 17.1 per cent of Scottish Mortgage's assets were in bonds
and other liquid asset instruments. The rest were in UK equities (49.6 per
cent), Europe (13.4 per cent), Pacific (10.7 per cent), America (6.9 per
cent) and Japan (2.3 per cent).
Compared with the international indices, that leaves the trust underweight
in both Japan and the US. Ward says he views both markets as valued quite
fully and is very concerned about the technical position of the Tokyo
market. But he sees Europe as good value because of falling interest rates,
and feels the non-Japanese Far Eastern markets offer the best prospects for
economic growth.
Because of personal equity plan requirements, the trust has to keep 50 per
cent of its assets within the UK and European Community. In addition, a
substantial UK holding is needed to pay the dividend (Scottish Mortgage has
a commitment to maintain its dividend in real terms).
Baillie Gifford picks Scottish Mortgage's investments via a three-stage
process. An investment policy committee decides on broad strategy and the
investment manager then makes the detailed asset allocation. Finally, the
individual stocks are picked by teams which focus on four areas: UK,
continental Europe, the US and the Far East. The trusts's ten largest
investments at December 31 were J. Sainsbury, Tomkins, Alacatel Alsthom,
Shell, Bass, Hanson, Astra, Tesco, Societe Generale and Lloyds bank.
The trust likes to have relatively concentrated portfolios. Overall, it has
111 holdings, 50 in the UK. 'If you like the stock, you should have a
substantial holding,' says the 43-year-old Ward, who joined Baillie Gifford
in 1971, ran Scottish Mortgage's UK portfolio from 1981 and has been in
overall charge since 1989.
Lewis Aaron, investment trust analyst at SG Warburg Securities, says:
'Scottish Mortgage is a little light in North America for our liking, but it
has delivered the goods and, at the current discount, looks attractive.'
Key facts. On February 28, the trust's total assets were Pounds 1.042m. Net
assets were Pounds 807m, equivalent to nav per share of 223.8p. On March 2,
the share price of 193p put the shares on a discount of 14 per cent,
according to NatWest Securities Ltd. The market capitalisation was Pounds
696m and the yield was 2.7 per cent. Baillie Gifford's fee is 0.045 per cent
of net assets per quarter, plus 7.45 per cent a year of attributable
earnings.
Board. This is entirely non-executive. Sir Michael Herries, the chairman
since 1984, is a former chairman of the Royal Bank of Scotland. Other board
members are Geoffrey Ball, chairman and chief executive of CALA; George
Gwilt, a former managing director of Standard Life; Ian Irwin, chairman and
chief executive of Scottish Transport Group; Fred Johnston, executive
chairman of Johnston Press; Lord Sanderson of Bowden, chairman of the
Conservative party in Scotland; and Jack Shaw, a deputy governor of the Bank
of Scotland.
Savings plan and Pep details. The only charge on the savings scheme (apart
from government stamp duty) is a Pounds 10-plus-VAT fee when investors want
to sell shares. The minimum monthly investment is Pounds 30 and Pounds 250
for a lump sum.
The Pep has an initial charge of Pounds 30 plus VAT, and a half-yearly
charge of Pounds 15 plus VAT. Dealing commissions are 0.2 per cent. The
first two withdrawals in a tax year are free; subsequent withdrawals cost
Pounds 10 plus VAT.

IN FEBRUARY last year, Peter Nicholson, a non-executive director of Crest
Nicholson, the housebuilder, bought 100,000 shares at 30p. Since then the
shares have proved volatile, but fellow non-executive director Geoffrey Fox
reduced his holding recently by 100,000 shares, selling at a price of 51p.
Crest Nicholson is forecast to return to profit in the year to end-October
1993; shares have outperformed the market by more than 60 per cent over the
past three months. Keith Carnelley, chairman and chief executive of Polar,
the electronic components group, has sold 450,000 shares at 126p. Michael
George, his managing director, sold 50,000 shares at the same price. A third
director then sold 70,000.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Possible pearls that hide within
shells - Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STOCK market recently reminded me of conditions in 1986: share prices
moving upwards, even of companies which are really 'rubbish'; an increasing
number of rights issues from companies large and small; private investors
rushing to buy 'penny' shares; and greater interest being shown in small
companies which can possibly be used as shells for the injection of new
activities. Even some of the names are the same.
Take Downiebrae Holdings which, in February, saw its shares shoot up 22p in
one day on news that Robert Newman had acquired a 22.99 per cent stake.
Newman was reported as saying that Downiebrae was 'the perfect vehicle for
acquisitions' as it had Pounds 4.7m of cash, two properties, and two
northern-based engineering businesses. He planned to use the company to
expand into engineering or other fields.
In 1986, Newman was one of several investors who acquired a 29.9 per cent
shareholding in another small 'shell' company, Times Veneer. He became an
executive director and Times Veneer changed its name to Era Group, embarking
on acquisitions that included Lexterten and AS Royston (furniture
companies); Richard Kohnstam (models, games and toys and owner of the
Beatties toy shop chain); and Shadow GB (owner of the Tecno and Fox Talbot
camera retailers).
I did very well from Times Veneer, having bought shares on May 12 and 13
1986 for 17.5p and 18p respectively. I took quick profits when I sold some
for 24p on May 23, then more at 55p in September 1986 and disposed of most
of the rest for 163p in September 1987.
This was quite good timing, as the shares were hit by the October 1987
crash. I was lucky to spot Times Veneer as a potential shell before Newman
and his colleagues moved into it. Unfortunately, although I had been
following Downiebrae since June last year, I had not bought shares in it and
so missed the recent leap in price.
What attracted me to Downiebrae initially was a report in the June 26 1992
issue of the Investors Chronicle. This revealed that the company's share
price was only 28p, yet its net asset value was 35p; and although its market
capitalisation was only Pounds 4.9m, it then had net cash of Pounds 4.42m.
I thought Downiebrae would make an ideal shell but did not buy shares in it
since, at that time, I was concerned that a number of my holdings in other
companies, bought on 'shell' or takeover hopes, had not seen any action.
Another sign of shell activity in February was the report that Multitrust,
controlled by financier Andrew Perloff, was interested in acquiring a large
shareholding in Radiant Metal Finishing, another company I have followed
because I regarded it, too, as an ideal shell. I have bought and sold shares
in Radiant, and made reasonable profits, several times. I missed out on
Radiant's initial rise in February after news of Perloff's interest was
published, but I have now acquired a small holding for my personal pension
scheme.
Ideally, this year will continue to be good for shell companies. I hope it
will follow the pattern of 1986 when Charles Gordon (plus Charles and
Maurice Saatchi) bought a large stake in NMC Investments, a company chaired
by DC Marshall. I spotted NMC, a small packaging company, as a potential
shell in September 1982 when I bought shares for 12.5p. Until the move by
Gordon in 1986 the shares had been rather lack-lustre. But he and his
colleagues transformed and expanded the company and I sold my stake for 205p
in 1987.
My hope is that some entrepreneurs now will show interest in two other
companies chaired by DC Marshall, London Finance &amp; Investment Group, and
Burlington Group. Both would make ideal shells: they have modest market
capitalisations and could be steered easily in many directions and expanded
rapidly.
My personal pension scheme has been in and out of London Finance over the
years, investing each time in the hope of a takeover and selling when
nothing happened. It continues to retain a small holding. London Finance,
with a share price of 18p, has a market capitalisation of only Pounds 4.5m.
Burlington Group would be even better. Its shares are around 17 1/2 p but
its market capitalisation is only Pounds 2.66m and the bulk of its assets
are fixed-interest investments, gilt-edged stock and cash.
Experience shows, however, that caution is needed when looking at 'penny'
shares and shell companies. It might take years (if ever) before an
entrepreneur spots the potential. Dealing costs on lowly-priced shares can
be considerable. In 1992, stock exchange figures showed the average spread -
the difference between the buying price and selling price - on 'less liquid'
stocks ranged from 12.22 per cent in May that year to 14.35 per cent in
August.
Some penny shares have had even greater spreads. It is not unknown for
brokers to offer shares in a company at, say, 12p to buyers but offer 8p to
sellers. The share price, therefore, has to perform remarkably well for an
investor just to break even. But including shares with shell appeal as a
modest part of a portfolio does provide some added spice - especially for
the patient.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Service with a smile - The
advantages of private company tax vehicles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL BISHOP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROLE of the service company has been spotlighted this week by news
stories about director-general John Birt's employment status at the BBC.
Such companies are common and, although the recent debate has centred on tax
advantages, it is important to realise that many do have a commercial
purpose.
Take, for example, a computer consultant or a sound mixer in the
entertainment industry. He or she may have several different clients for
whom they work at different times of the year. It is often convenient for
the consultant to set up a company to service those clients rather than work
through a clumsy series of employment contracts.
Assuming that the service company does have commercial substance, and is
recognised as such by the Revenue, then there will be tax advantages. The
most important is probably the cash flow advantage which comes from being
taxed under Schedule D, rather than having to submit to PAYE on salary, and
the more generous rules relating to expenses which apply to companies.
In addition, careful planning may mean a more significant tax deferral.
Corporate tax rates at between 25 per cent and 33 per cent are significantly
lower than the 40 per cent marginal rate of income tax. This means that if
the service company does not pay all its income as salary to the consultant,
the income left in the company will be taxed at a relatively low rate.
Remember, though, that this is only a deferral. Normally, the consultant
will have to pay income tax when cash is finally extracted. This could prove
expensive if marginal income tax rates increase, so thought is needed.
The use of a service company also has some national insurance advantages.
National insurance will have to be accounted for on the salary paid to the
consultant by the service company, but will not apply to fees paid to the
company by the client. Again, if the service company does not pass on all
its income to the consultant - or pays some out by way of dividend - there
will be a saving.
If the cap on an employee's national insurance contributions is raised, or
eliminated in this month's Budget, the savings will be even more attractive.
There is, however, a downside. Setting up a service company involves extra
work. It will usually be necessary to comply with Companies Acts rules, to
charge VAT and to maintain PAYE and national insurance records. The
consultant will not be entitled to the employee benefits provided by his
clients, so he will have to make his own arrangements about a pension and a
car.
There may even, in some cases, be tax disadvantages. For instance, a
consultant will not be eligible to participate in approved employee share
option schemes and may miss a significant opportunity to make money.
The concept of the service company needs to be treated cautiously. In the
right business and right circumstances, it can mean important tax
advantages. The Inland Revenue is aware of this and will examine each
company carefully.
These are complicated but, broadly, the Revenue checks that a service
company has commercial substance and that it is a proper business which
carries a commercial risk. If your activities are likely to pass the Revenue
test, then it may be worth considering the use of a service company. If they
are not, then it is probably safer to settle for a straightforward
employment contract.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Mortgage protection blow - Halifax
gets tough on policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 180,000 borrowers from the Halifax building society are being told
that their mortgage protection insurance is to be more expensive and poorer
value from April.
This insurance is taken out by home-buyers to cover the cost of their
monthly payments if they cannot meet them because of unemployment, accident
or sickness.
Halifax borrowers will see annual premiums on Mortgage Payment Protector
rise from Pounds 6 to Pounds 6.90 for every Pounds 100 of monthly benefit,
while unemployment cover is being halved from 24 to 12 months.
Some people, however, will face a rise from Pounds 5 to Pounds 6.90. Their
policies pre-date Halifax's change of insurer to Financial Insurance Group
and do not allow for a change to their terms and conditions.
Halifax is getting round the problem by cancelling these policies and
offering the new one instead. It says those affected are 'a relatively small
proportion of the total.'
The waiting period before the plan pays out remains unchanged at 30 days and
those who claim accident and sickness cover will still be protected for 24
months.
Borrowers do not have much choice. If they do not accept the premium
increase, the policy will lapse.
Halifax is the latest lender to make changes to its mortgage protection
cover because increasing unemployment has caused a big rise in claims. In
January, Abbey National announced it was raising premiums on its Paymentcare
 -underwritten by General Accident - from Pounds 6 to Pounds 6.95 for every
Pounds 100 of benefit.
It said the period of cover remained unchanged at one year for unemployment
and three years for accident and sickness claims. The waiting period is
three months.
Bradford &amp; Bingley is in talks with its insurer, Eagle Star, over its
mortgage protection policy, which is held by 30 per cent of borrowers. 'We
will have to increase the rate because of the claims situation,' said a
spokesman, who expected the rise to take effect mid-year. Bradford's
existing policy costs Pounds 6 per Pounds 100 of cover for 12 months and the
waiting period is 45 days.
Mortgage protection insurance is rapidly becoming the kind of cover which is
there when it is not needed and absent when it is. Usually, the policy is
offered only to new borrowers or those taking out a home improvement loan.
The assumption is that people would not take out a large loan if they
thought they might lose their job.
Many people who become unemployed qualify for state income support to help
with mortgage interest payments. These cover half the payments for the first
16 weeks - without having to wait for up to 12 weeks, as many lenders demand
 -and the full amount after that. But those who have taken out their own
mortgage protection insurance are not eligible for the state benefit.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: How green is a green fund?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF continental Europe's 'green' investment funds which make
environmental or ethical claims could lose the confidence of investors
because of poor definitions and a low level of supporting research,
according to a survey* published this week.
Many of the 'green' funds identified in the study did not have clear
research methodologies and only a few could explain how stocks were
selected. Furthermore, a number of funds depended upon the advice of brokers
or financiers, rather than social or environmental scientists, as to whether
a company was 'green' or 'ethical'.
Of the 25 ethical or green funds in continental Europe which claimed either
to avoid companies with interests in defence, tobacco or alcohol, or claimed
only to invest in companies with a sound environmental record, just 12
stated that they employed additional research to investigate companies.
The remainder of the funds were unable to provide systems for rigorously
substantiating the green or ethical claims made in their criteria.
The survey said unclear definitions and research input perhaps explained the
inclusion of companies which do not feature in green funds in the UK and the
US, such as GEC, the UK electronics company, Sandoz, the Swiss drug company,
Rhone-Poulenc, the French chemicals company, British Petroleum and RTZ, the
UK mining group.
The survey said that across Europe, including the UK, there are now more
than 70 ethical or green products for investors to choose from, amounting to
about Pounds 734m under management. The UK-based funds account for around
Pounds 400m or 54.5 per cent of the total investment, followed by Luxembourg
with Pounds 79.3m or 10.8 per cent, France with Pounds 75.3m or 10.3 per
cent and Sweden with Pounds 59.4m or 8.1 per cent.
The survey noted that the Luxembourg-based funds included so-called Sicav
funds, which are managed from other European countries.
The survey identified Shanks &amp; McEwan, the waste management company, as the
most popular stock with UK green funds. Generale des Eaux, the construction,
water and waste management group, was the most popular with French green
funds, and in Germany, GEA, the air purification and process engineering
company, came out on top.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Trustees must face ICI portfolio
headache - An important decision looms following ICI's demerger plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES with ICI shares in their portfolio should meet well before June to
decide what to do with them if they are to avoid possible action for breach
of trust. The problem stems from a case decided by the Privy Council in 1930
which says that a company which is not in liquidation cannot make a
'capital' distribution to its shareholders except as a step in an authorised
reduction of capital.
The planned demerger of ICI in June is neither a liquidation nor an
authorised reduction of capital. It will be effected by ICI declaring a huge
dividend out of distributable profits, which it will satisfy by allocating
shares in Zeneca Limited. These shares will then, because of the Privy
Council case, be treated as 'income' in the hands of the trustees.
The majority of trusts in the UK - apart from accumulation and maintenance
trusts set up for children under the age of 25 - do not give their
controllers power to accumulate income because the tax regime on them is
prejudicial. The trustees must, therefore, pay income to the beneficiary -
known as the the life tenant - as it arises.
So, if the trustees add the Zeneca shares to their portfolio, they will be
depriving the life tenant - for example, a widow - of her 'income' and will
be in breach of trust. (If they add the shares with the life tenant's
consent, the trustees may not be sued - but the life tenant will have
created a new settlement of these shares which could have unexpected tax
consequences and create administrative headaches).
The alternative is to distribute the Zeneca shares to the life tenant. This
also could land the trustees in trouble.
Without a specific instruction in the trust deed, trustees have a common-law
obligation to make investments so that the life tenant gets a 'reasonable'
income while, at the same time, preserving the capital for those entitled to
it after the life tenant's death. They also have a statutory obligation to
take into account the circumstances of the beneficiaries when making,
changing or retaining investments.
Therefore, if the trust portfolio were diminished substantially because the
trustees had paid out the Zeneca shares to the life tenant, the remainderman
might be able to sue the trustees for breach of their common law and
statutory obligations.
It is also a moot point as to whether demergers such as the ICI split would
be treated by the courts as an exception to the 1930 Privy Council case, in
which event all trustees who distributed the Zeneca shares would be in
breach of trust because they would have distributed capital.
There are also tax problems with distributing the Zeneca shares. The life
tenant, although he might not be liable to income tax on them, might have to
pay capital gains tax on the entire proceeds when he came to sell the shares
and would not be entitled to any future indexation because the Inland
Revenue believed the base of the shares would be nil.
The position is somewhat more straightforward for trustees of children's
accumulation and maintenance trusts or discretionary trusts where there is
power to accumulate the income. In these cases, the trustees should add the
Zeneca shares to the existing trust portfolio and will suffer no adverse tax
consequences. But not all discretionary trusts have power to accumulate the
income, in which case the Zeneca shares must be distributed and the
nightmare reappears - but worse.
The tax position of trusts where there is no life tenant (discretionary
trusts) is very different. On the distribution of the Zeneca shares from a
discretionary trust, their value must be grossed-up to pay tax at 35 per
cent. In addition, the trustees will have to pay CGT on any gain made on the
shares - unless an election is made to hold over the chargeable gain until
the beneficiary disposes of them.
The discretionary beneficiary might be pleased to receive his windfall
distribution, but he will not thank his trustees for the tax charges.
So, what should the beleaguered trustee do, assuming he does not wish to
incur the expense of going to the court for direction? Even selling the
shares is not without its problems.
First, he must sell before the dividend is declared and the demerger occurs
or it will be too late. Second, the sale could result in an unwanted CGT
charge in the trust. But if he sells, and provided he sells in time, at
least he should be protected from claims by his beneficiaries.
Representations have been flooding in to the Lord Chancellor's office for a
change in trust law. Despite the urgency and seriousness of the problems,
however, there does not seem to be any prospect of action before the ICI
split in June.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Plastic card fraud total tops Pounds
165m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CRIMINALS spent Pounds 165m last year through the fraudulent use of plastic
cards - the equivalent of a Pounds 5 loss every second. Banks and building
societies pick up most of the bill, with a card-holder's liability
restricted to Pounds 50 maximum, unless the bank or society can prove that
the owner was responsible for the loss.
Announcing the figure this week, Richard Allen, chief executive of the
Association of Payment Clearing Services, said the loss was 'totally
unacceptable'. However, for the first time, the rise in plastic card fraud
has at least been contained. Losses were Pounds 60m in 1989, Pounds 122m the
following year and Pounds 165.6m in 1991.
The fraudulent use of credit and cheque guarantee cards has been taking
place against a background of rapid growth in plastic card transactions.
There were 400m of these in 1985 and this is forecast to rise to 4bn a year
by 2000. There are 80m plastic cards in circulation in the UK.
Apacs, which oversees money transmission in the UK, attributes the
containment of fraud losses to the launch of its Card Watch campaign last
year.
This included making the delivery of cards more secure. Apacs estimates that
one quarter of fraud losses in 1991 were because of the diversion or
interception of the card with the consequent fraud losses peaking at Pounds
3m a month in the spring of 1991.
The introduction of registered post, courier services and delivery through
branch networks has brought this figure down to an average of Pounds 2m a
month lost through non-receipt of cards. Nearly 40 per cent of cards are now
delivered through means other than the post.
This year the Card Watch campaign is targeting a number of groups to try and
raise awareness of plastic card crime. Women are thought to be particularly
vulnerable because they keep cards in handbags which can be snatched by
criminals or are left hanging temptingly on the back of a seat.
Motorists are another target. Apacs estimates that 18 per cent of
fraudulently used cards are taken from cars. Many plastic cards also go
missing from offices. People can be lured into a false sense of security in
the office and tend to leave possessions unguarded.
Finally, young people are being targeted so that they 'understand the
concept of plastic, its value, its use and the implications of its misuse,'
according to Apacs.
Card issuers are also spending Pounds 500m as part of a three year
anti-fraud investment in new technology to fight crime. This includes
testing cardholder identification techniques such as photographs,
finger-scanning and digitised signatures.

FT  06 MAR 93 / So what do you mean, Mr Major?: Dominic Lawson wonders if
the prime minister is suffering from a serious case of inarticulateness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
J. ALFRED Prufrock, TS Eliot's most poignant evocation of self-loathing
mediocrity, had a characteristically plaintive refrain: 'That is not what I
meant at all. That is not it, at all.' I am beginning to think that Eliot
had a figure very like John Major in mind. The man seems to have developed a
worrying tendency to say something publicly on one day and spend the next
commissioning his office to say: 'That is not what the prime minister meant
at all. That is not it at all.'
A month ago, at the Carlton club in London, the prime minister appeared  -
in a speech pre-sold as 'visionary' - to endorse the idea of a scheme called
workfare for the unemployed. 'I increasingly wonder,' said Major, reading
from a prepared text, 'whether paying unemployment benefit, without offering
or requiring any activity in return, serves the unemployed people or society
well.'
Major's words seemed clearly to imply that the government was considering
ending the system under which, to receive unemployment benefit, you need
only to be unemployed and seeking work. So, at least, the newspapers, and
the Labour party interpreted the prime minister's remarks. The next day,
apparently surprised at this, the spin doctors at No 10 protested that Major
had not meant any such thing. It seems he was just 'flying a kite,' which
was hauled in fast.
Two weeks ago, John Major, in an attempt to avoid being outflanked by the
Labour party's new hard line against youth crime, said that we ' should
condemn a little more, and understand a little less.' What Major meant to
say, I suppose, is that he felt that we should be more censorious and less
sympathetic towards criminals. But that is not what he actually said, in a
phrase which merely made him seem silly.
Now Major has again - as Ronald Reagan once immortally put it - misspoken
himself. On Wednesday, he told the Independent newspaper that he did not
agree with the 1980s' ethos of allowing manufacturing to look after itself,
and giving industry no special assistance. 'I don't agree with it. I didn't
agree with it in the 1980s. I was a minority view in the 1980s. I am not a
minority view now and, anyway, I am in a better position to expound my
views.'
I do not think it was wilful of the press to interpret this as a
not-so-thinly-veiled criticism of the Thatcher administration's attitude to
manufacturing industry. In any case, the Thatcherites were duly furious at
Major's remarks, not least for their insouciant attitude to collective
cabinet responsibility.
Yet again, Downing Street's paid apologisers were sent out to make amends,
if The Times is to be believed. It reported yesterday: 'Baroness Thatcher
was reported by close colleagues to be satisfied after the prime minister
and his staff spent much of an embarrassing day emphasising that his
comments had not been intended as an attack on the former prime minister . .
. the conclusion among ministers last night was that Mr Major must have been
referring to Lord Lawson, his former boss at the Treasury.' Oh, so that's
all right, then.
It is interesting to speculate about the reasons for this apparent inability
of the prime minister to say exactly what he means. Perhaps it is not an
inability at all, but a deliberate ploy: fly a kite and, if the public and
the press do not like the colour, you can always say you did not really like
it, either. But that suggests a high degree of deviousness, which I do not
believe Major has. The more frightening possibility is that he is simply
inarticulate. That is a very unusual thing in a prime minister.  Thatcher,
it is true, was no great orator but she was - and is - highly articulate and
almost incapable constitutionally of being misunderstood.
Inarticulateness might not be such a handicap for a politician who wants to
remain a back-room boy, a technocrat. Major though, has recently shown signs
of wanting also to be a prophet with 'a vision.' But words fail him. As
Prufrock intoned: 'I am no prophet - and here's no great matter; I have seen
the moment of my greatness flicker, And I have seen the eternal Footman hold
my coat, and snicker, And in short, I was afraid.'

FT  06 MAR 93 / Private View: An ally's estimate of Britain's worth -
Raymond Seitz, US ambassador to Britain, explains his view of the 'special
relationship'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN HE was posted back to Britain as US ambassador in 1991, the first
professional diplomat ever appointed to the job, Raymond Seitz made two
resolutions.
'The first was that I would never use the phrase 'special relationship' and
the second was that I would never quote Winston Churchill,' he said.
Have you stuck to them? I asked.
'And I have stuck to both of them. I have no objection to 'the special
relationship'. I just think it's a little shopworn. It's become a code in
some respects to make people teary (tearful). But we're moving into a new
phase in a very new world and it kind of obscures what I think are harder
realities. It is the hard realities of life and of international affairs
that make this relationship unusual, effective, productive, coincident . . .
'
Does the expression signify less these days to ordinary citizens?
'Well, I don't know exactly what it refers to. Does it mean that every time
we say 'frog' you jump or every time you say 'frog' we jump? Do people go to
Andrew Lloyd-Webber plays in America? Yes. Do we go to see Howard's End, do
we give Anthony Hopkins an Oscar? Yes, we do. Do we listen to the same rock
and roll? Yeah. Is that the special relationship? Sure, you have Americans -
and they don't have to be of British stock - who love to see the Changing of
the Guard and who read Christopher Robin to their children.' He gestured
towards the window of his big office in Grosvenor Square.
Raymond Seitz was back in London after helping smooth the way for John
Major's unexpectedly cheerful first encounter with the new US president. But
the question at the back of my mind was whether Bill Clinton was merely
being polite when he reassured an apprehensive British prime minister that
the relationship was 'special to me personally and special to the United
States and I think will be as long as I am sitting here.'
Seitz agreed that the phrase is more a British than an American
pre-occupation. He also observed the familiar, self-denigratory flavour of
much British press comment in advance of the summit - 'as if almost hoping
that somehow it wouldn't work.'
This week, John Major rounded on what he called the gloomsters. If the
special relationship exists, what can a demoralised Britain bring to it? I
asked the ambassador what he thought of the present mood of doubt and drift.
'There is a black dog that wanders around Britain worrying about its
future,' he said, 'about its sense of decline, of what it relates to. Is it
to an empire, to the Continent, or across the Atlantic?'
The present crisis of morale, he went on, could be explained by the
insecurity of living in a post-Cold War world and by the persistence of the
UK recession, 'a feeling that the dawn never quite comes, that the green
shoots don't quite press high enough. I think you can even add what's
happened to the Royal Family or the Church of England. And I think what
happened in Liverpool (he was referring to the murder of two-year-old James
Bulger) acted as a kind of flashpoint, somewhat in the way the coalpit
closures did.'
There had been much the same gloom in the air in 1979, when Seitz completed
the first of three tours of duty in the London embassy. He came back in
1984, as second in command to Charles Price II, bringing two family dogs:
Topsy, a Brooklyn pooch which he later described as 'smart as hell' and
Scarlett, an English labrador, 'as thick as two planks.'
He found that Margaret Thatcher had instilled new confidence and
assertiveness in the country. 'One felt that Britain had a firmer grip on
its destiny. It's that which seems to have loosened a little.'
I suggested that John Major has made little or no impression on Americans.
Seitz smoothly sidestepped the invitation to a faux pas and talked instead
of Thatcher's impact.
It was not the Falklands war which had impressed Americans, he said. 'What
really crystallised it was not the grand sweep, the Cold War struggle. It
was the clarity with which Mrs Thatcher said Yes to the raid on Libya. Her
willingness to take tremendous domestic political flak really lifted the
American image of Britain.'
The ambassador manages to combine cool analysis with a winning lack of
pomposity. He is the typical Yale preppy, you would say, a man of Republican
tendencies and of no visible eccentricities - unless you count as eccentric
the fact that he is twice married, smokes, and keeps a collection of old
locks on his office window-sill. 'I've been told it's Freudian', he said,
smiling.
Seitz is so much admired ('the most capable American in Europe,' according
to one diplomat) that a campaign developed on both sides of the Atlantic to
keep him in London in spite of the change from a Republican to a Democrat
Administration. When I asked Seitz this week whether he would be recalled he
said he had not been told he was staying, but nor - and here he looked
insouciant - that he would be going.
Raymond GH Seitz was born in Hawaii at the end of 1940 where his father,
later a major-general who took part in the Omaha Beach landing in Normandy,
was then stationed. At Yale, he was president of the Delta Kappa Epsilon
fraternity, apparently known as 'the animal house'. His State Department
career included Canada, Kenya and Zaire before London, with spells in
Washington under Kissinger, Vance, Haigh and Baker. George Bush put him in
charge of European and Canadian affairs: he was the leading US official for
German unification talks and helped persuade Moscow to accept a united
Germany in NATO. Today, he is occupied with Anglo-American policy towards
Bosnia.
I asked him whether Britain had anything any more to teach the US - a
question to make a diplomat squirm. He hedged a bit, and replied: 'Well, I
find this a very civil society. One of the things I find most appealing here
is the little transactions of everyday life, whether it is buying the
newspaper at the newsagents or taking a taxi-cab or bumping into somebody.'
What could Britain contribute to the relationship?
Seitz launched fluently into his exposition. The three broad bases, he said,
were geography, language and common attitudes and values. 'From these deeper
things comes a greater likelihood that the US and the UK are going to
identify their interests internationally in a roughly similar way.
'If that's the case, what do you bring to the game? The independent nuclear
deterrent is the most obvious example.' Formerly there existed what might be
called a 'comfortable balance of terror'. Today the danger was nuclear
proliferation. This, and the unpredictability of events in the former Soviet
Union, could make Britain's bomb strategically as important as before. 'So
I'm not prepared to draw the conclusion that Britain's nuclear role is
anachronistic.'
Another asset was the historic exchange of military intelligence and other
information, now extending into law enforcement, drugs and terrorism. Third,
there was Britain's seat on the Security Council of the UN (a status today
being challenged). The UN's new-found authority as world peacekeeper could
make Britain's role here more important.
'One final point - and I think this could be a critical one in the world
ahead: there will always be a few issues or challenges where the US is
prepared to act alone to protect what we regard as our vital national
interest. However, I think there will also be a much bigger category of
issues where the willingness of the international community or the US to act
will depend very much on the degree to which other nations are prepared to
act and take risks.
'And when you look around the world, you can count on the fingers of one
hand - and that may be an overestimate - those nations which are prepared to
act and which have a capability to act, and to act even beyond their own
region of interest.'
I turned to the question of Britain in Europe and Seitz confirmed that the
US attaches the highest importance to Britain's active membership of the EC.
But, I asked, do you get the sense that Britain is drifting somewhere in
mid-Atlantic and doesn't know where to put the anchor down?
'My impression is Britain does not put as much ideological and emotional
weight into the concept of a European union. That kind of rhetoric, those
kinds of ideals and goals are very important on the Continent.'
What about this British ambivalence?
'I watch the debate every day. If Britain is determined to isolate itself
from Europe then the nature of our relationship is of course going to be
different.'
Are they compatible alliances?
'Oh, I don't think they're mutually exclusive at all. I know there's a
zero-sum proposition: the analogue is America's preoccupation with the
Pacific. While that zero-sum calculation is analytically attractive, I don't
think that's how in fact it works.' He would not agree that the Conservative
Euro-rebels were necessarily defending the old alliance: they might simply
be Gaullist nationalists.
What difference does it make to have Bill Clinton in the White House?
'On the basis of five weeks, it's a little early to make that judgment. But
I have not seen anything that would make me revise what I have just said.'
You mean the pragmatic underpinnings are strong enough to make the
ideological or moral differences relatively unimportant?
'I don't think there is a great ideological gulf,' Seitz replied.
But in political terms a big change has occurred.
'Yes, it's a big change but its happened before. I mean, you had Margaret
Thatcher and Jimmy Carter. In the end it is the degree to which there is
this coincidence of strategic interests, whether it's trade issues or Bosnia
or Iraq or dealing with the former Soviet Union. My argument is that,
uniquely, our interests are going to be far more likely to coincide than
not.'
Would Labour be less sentimental about the special relationship?
'It's not so partisan. I'm glad to see that the Labour party, perhaps
because of the Clinton victory, in many respects is anxious to resume a
dialogue with the US.'
The relationship would fare much better without excuses or hype, the
ambassador said. 'If one scrapes away some of the rhetoric we'll be able to
deal with this relationship in a much healthier way.
'It's unusual to have to appear to defend the value of all of this. It's
wrapped up a bit with your earlier question. There's almost a psychic wish
here to say, 'Well, there's another thing that's gone] Well, we blew that
one too] Well, we're no longer important or relevant.' It's this return of
the hangdog.'
Would he prefer to call it something boring like the 'reliable
relationship'.
'No, I prefer to call it a strategic relationship.'
But is there any other country with which the US has it?
'Not that I can think of. It's not all harmony, and it shouldn't be because
interests will clash from time to time . . . But no, not that I can think
of.'
The Special Relationship, in other words, is not special, merely unique.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Hawks and Handsaws: Norman Lamont, we love you
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE UK Budget looming, the time has come to speak the unspeakable:
Norman Lamont must stay. He has become a national treasure. Our debt to him
is bottomless. Crises have not toppled him. Scorn has not unmanned him. He
is unbowed by rudery. He just keeps smiling through. We may not rate him as
chancellor of the exchequer but as a lightning-rod for our misfortunes he is
almost Churchillian.
The penny dropped for me last Monday when the newspapers carried photos of
the G7 finance ministers at the end of their London meeting. In the centre
of the front row was good old Norman - head thrown back, eyes closed in
ecstasy at some G7 joke, teeth scrubbed and twinkling, eyebrows artfully
combed, his tie a brilliant blue. I thought: God knows how you do it,
Norman, but you are still not unhorsed.
Hawks &amp; Handsaws has more than an idle interest in Norman Lamont, for it was
this column, in February 1991, that first suggested that he was heading for
the quicksands. In the months that followed, the economy dived deeper and
deeper. Norman became a laughing stock. Yet still he stands before us,
resolute and insouciant, like a bookmaker at the Derby, confident of
laughing last.
It has now become plain that all Britain's troubles should be attributed to
the prime minister, not to his chancellor, for John Major has been revealed
as fatally cackhanded. Major used to be a Brixton councillor, and so he
should have remained. But he entered national politics and was eventually
sucked up, in the vacuum around Margaret Thatcher, until he popped out, like
a cork from a musty bottle, at the very pinnacle of UK politics.
In the meantime, Norman Lamont has taken the flak, shouldered our troubles
and acted the role of national scapegoat, on whose head we have symbolically
placed our multiple sins and woes. The policies were always Major's, yet we
heaped our scorn on Norman. He reminds me of Hercules.
One day soon, I hope, someone will do for Norman Lamont what Nicholas
Tomalin did for Princess Anne in the Sunday Times in November 1973 - deliver
him from ridicule. At the time, we were all fed up with Princess Anne. We
thought she was a snob, and dim and dull to boot. It was part of Tomalin's
genius as a journalist to detect in Princess Anne a quality we had not
noticed. He called it her 'redeeming nullity.' Her irrelevance was her
point.
She was an innocent and an anachronism, in the best possible sense. 'I think
it highly unlikely,' wrote Tomalin, 'that she has ever smoked pot, acted in
a happening, signed a petition for the Jackson Five, canvassed for Shelter
or Release, frugged, freaked-out, been to Biba, or done any of the other
things normal healthy young contemporary girls feel obliged to do.'
Britain had lost an empire yet found a role - watching Princess Anne on TV
while she went bravely over the jumps on her horse, Hyperion. We needed
Princess Anne. Almost from that moment, her fortunes soared. As a result,
most of us today can gaze upon Princess Anne, now happily remarried, without
so much as a retch.
Saving Princess Anne was a bit like saving the whales - something for which
posterity will thank and honour us. And if they and she could be saved, we
can save Norman Lamont. We must look closely at the chancellor and
acknowledge this simple truth: in the days of plague ahead, we will need his
cheerfulness and stoicism, his singing in the bath and his bookmaker's
laugh, more than ever before.
In summarising his case, Nicholas Tomalin wrote: 'One could go on listing
reasons for approving of Princess Anne forever. Name any aspect of modern
life, and she can satisfy it in some way or other (usually, as I've
explained, by having never heard of it). Everyone says that as we strive to
accustom ourselves to a new, second-rate role in the world, we must
concentrate on doing really well the less ambitious things. No more
hubristic attempts to build Concordes or rule the world; just small,
ingenious, innocent activities . . . These are good because they are within
our competence. Princess Anne is something real, good, and suitably
unambitious. We should be grateful for her.'
Take my word for it: if we love Princess Anne, we shall shortly love the
chancellor.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Titus deconstructed - Jackie Wullschlager reviews a
mind-gripping new work by east German playwright Heiner Muller, directed by
Gunter Kramer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE SKITTLES, the cultural giants of the former East Germany are tumbling:
first it was Manfred Wekworth, director of Brecht's Berliner Ensemble; now
even writers who seemed to stand against the regime - Heiner Muller, Christa
Wolf - have been implicated as STASI agents. Muller, Germany's foremost
living dramatist, is a fascinating case because from the start he refused to
reject DDR culture wholesale in favour of capitalism.
But while east Germany has mostly embraced western values with open arms, in
the theatre the reverse has happened. Directors trained in the east -
Muller, Katharina Thalbach, Matthias Langhoff - are in huge demand in the
west. And behind them all, the ghost of Brecht, icon of DDR culture, stalks
German stages more insistently than ever. His influence is overwhelming in
the two major post-war dramatic traditions: theatre as political-moral
debate - classics recast as condition-of-Germany plays have been standard
fare since the Wall fell and theatre as pure aestheticism, texts
deconstructed, action deliberately distanced from life.
At extremes, the Berlin Volksbuhne's rubbish-dump Lear typifies the first,
Robert Wilson's surreal Faustus the second. But the best synthesis of the
two traditions I have yet seen is an eye-opening, nerve-bending,
mind-gripping new Titus Andronicus, reworked by Heiner Muller and directed
in Cologne by Gunter Kramer, Germany's high priest of high stylisation.
Titus is Shakespeare's first and most grisly tragedy. Corpses litter the
stage in minutes, limbs are amputated, tongues cut out, human flesh served
to relatives for supper in a revenge war between conquering Romans and
vanquished Goths. Muller sees in it the ethnic cleansing, systemised rape
and guerilla tactics of the Bosnian conflict and the recent war in
Afghanistan.
When the Goths tip black plastic bags of bodies into the pit, they scrawl
'Death to the Romans' in elegant graffiti across the stage. Forced to learn
the victor's language, terrorists chant 'amo amas amat', as they exchange
mocking homosexual caresses. Some lines, Muller says in the programme, he
heard from Russian soldiers in DDR days. Woven into poetry is an ironic
chorus - 'William Shakespeare, my name and your name glow in blood'. Goths
ridicule Roman speeches by repeating them, a second out of time, like
discordant madrigals.
Muller calls his play Anatomy Titus Fall of Rome: A Shakespeare Commentary;
what interests Kramer is its deadly games of alienation and satire. A silent
first act is mimed to the war music of Philip Glass's Ahknaten; Romans, in
white robes, helmets and feathers, ashen faces painted into masks of
exagerated sensuality with fat red lips, eyebrows pink or blue, sockets
blackened, bop up and down against a waist-high ramp and pull faces, poke
tongues, in the fight to be emperor. It is half Punch and Judy, half eerie,
surreal ritual.
In the hunting scene where Lavinia is raped, she runs in and out of a forest
of metal rods bathed in silver-green light which descend from the ceiling
and jangle as she tries to flee: visual and acoustic symbol of her terror.
When her hands are cut off, the negro Aaron, in dark glasses and black
gloves, seizes her frilly white parasol, sticks it between his legs and
spins handstands. Aestheticised horror, the play of black on white, acrobats
jibing at mutilation: in its acute calculation and rhythm, Kramer's
stylisation disturbs more than the worst of blood and gore.
It is given emotional as well as topical life by a cast tuned to every
nuance of Muller's revision and every swing of Kramer's setting. Gerd Kunath
as Titus pits a rigid, heroic propriety against an absurdist commentary on
his own folly and idealism; when he cuts off his hand to save his sons and
has it returned to him with their heads, he throws the useless limb into the
audience with a shrug at once comic and heartbroken. His flexible face and
ever-moving body now browbeaten and sagging, now blank with horror,
sometimes mad, sometimes murderous, Kunath evokes a desperate warmth and
pity.
As Lavinia, Ingrid Andree changes from complacent Roman puppet to passionate
distraught heroine, to sacrificial victim danced upon as a prop. She returns
to life when she writes, as if the effort comes from the core of her being,
the names of her attackers with a stick held between her teeth into the
sand: a moment at once of perfect Shakespearean tenderness and Beckett-like
sad absurdity, and one of many unforgettable scenes in an extraordinary
production.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Gifted recitalist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMERICAN mezzo-soprano Florence Quivar has become a familiar figure on
the British concert platform - a sterling soloist in front-rank performances
of Mahler, the Verdi Requiem and Schoenberg's Gurrelieder. Her operatic side
is unknown here except via records.
Before Thursday night's concert, so were her gifts as a recitalist. These
proved to be prodigious. This event was the fifth in this season's
eight-part song series at the Purcell Room (artistic director: Iain
Burnside) - an excellent enterprise which seems not to have attracted south
of the river the song-recital crowds who have been flocking to the re-opened
Wigmore.
Yet to stir a small-ish audience in an unsympathetic auditorium (despite the
pot-plants) to heights of enthusiasm is strong testimony to a singer's art.
Miss Quivar did this, and filled that auditorium with beautiful sound -
full, graciously rounded, evenly delivered (no bumps and gear-changes across
a wide compass, no striving for big, rich effects), unfailingly sympathetic
in the musical personality that it betokened.
The programme opened with Purcell, which through lateness I missed (why on
earth should the hall's general starting time of 8pm have been brought
forward by a half-hour for this series?). It continued with Brahms and
Mahler's Wayfaring Lad songs, the latter particularly successful in
demonstrating the singer's ability to conjure moods and images through a
smoothly shaped singing line, to characterise music with honesty and
seriousness, and to sustain a close partnership with the (highly
accomplished) pianist, Armen Guzelimian.
Miss Quivar's French is a degree or two less malleable than her German; her
choice of four Faure songs preceded by the 'Air de lettres' and Prayer from
Massenet's Werther was interesting, and warmly executed, but lacking in
half-lights.
The glory of the recital was its closing group of spirituals. The simple
dignity of approach and the sense of unforced conviction concealed a knack
of bending words, snapping rhythms and colouring tones that was in its way
as finely controlled as that of an expert flamenco cantaor. Miss Quivar
exhilarated me and moved me deeply: I hope to repeat the experience as soon
as possible.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: French bounty from Susa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY POTTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 324 BC Susa was the scene of what must be the mega-marriage of all time,
when 80 of Alexander the Great's generals and 10,000 of his troops tied the
knot with a veritable army of Iranian debutantes. Churchgoers may also
remember Susa as the city of king Ahasuerus (Xerxes) and his seductive queen
Esther. But Susa's place among the grand metropolises of antiquity has
recently fared less well than its neighbour Babylon or even Persepolis,
Susa's twin capital of the Achaemenid empire brought down by Alexander.
The Royal City of Susa at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York should
go some way to setting the record straight. A sampling of the finest works
of art from the 4,000 years before Alexander paints a rich and varied
picture of life and culture in ancient southwest Iran. From a child's model
of a hedgehog riding a cart to statues of royalty, lavish jewellery and
other paraphernalia of court and temple life this is an engagingly exotic
offering which deserves an audience beyond hardened antiquarians. It comes
to the US on loan from the Louvre, where the bounty from a century's
enthusiastic if not always scientific digging by French archaeologists is
housed.
No other collection outside Iran could mount such a show and the Louvre is
to be commended for taking the opportunity of a face-life to the galleries
of the antiquites orientales to allow this material its first sojourn
abroad. New York is the sole venue.
Susa the capital of the Achaemenid Persians was the successor to Susa the
sometime capital of Elam, Mesopotamia's powerful eastern neighbour and
frequent adversary in battle. Most of the exhibition is rightly devoted to
this less well known people whose place in the parade of civilisation is
rarely done justice in encyclopaedias and school set texts.
The Sumerians invented the first system of writing but who ran a close
second? Probably not the Egyptians, but the Elamites. Among the most
intriguing objects are the clay tablets from around 3000 BC inscribed in the
Proto-Elamite script, accompanied by impressions of cylinder seals which
acted as a signature when rolled on the damp clay. The Proto-Elamite code
still awaits its Champollion but is assumed to record an early form of
Elamite. This strange language, later written in scripts which can be read,
is unrelated to any other known tongue.
From the same period are two of the highlights of the exhibition, a pair of
small but exquisitely wrought silver figures of an antelope and a seated,
clothed bull holding a vase in its outstretched hoofs. ('Animal Farm'
studies of animals carrying on like humans were a Proto-Elamite penchant.)
No finer examples of the silversmiths' craft at this early date are known
from anywhere in the world.
A thousand years earlier Susian potters decorated their wares with inventive
and sophisticated animal studies of dogs, snakes, ibexes and birds which
have survived their 6,000 years of interment almost unscathed. This corpus
is rightly celebrated as one of the apogees of the ancient ceramicist's art
 -again there is nothing in Mesopotamia or elsewhere at the time to match
it.
Lying near the Mesopotamian border, Susa was often at loggerheads with the
Sumerians, Babylonians and Assyrians. But the Elamites sometimes gave as
good as they got and many of the most famous Mesopotamian monuments were in
fact not found in Iraq at all but at Susa, whither they were triumphantly
carted off by a 12th century BC Elamite king with a name that sounds like a
Cherokee battle-cry - Shutruk-Nahunte. These Susian spoils - the richest
cache of Mesopotamian loot ever found - include the famous law code of
Hammurabi (the only significant piece not in the show) and sculptures and
narrative reliefs set up by Naram-Sin and other Akkadian kings to celebrate
their great buildings and battles.
The Met has a tradition of producing splendid catalogues which skilfully
meld sound scholarship to coffee-table design and the Susa offering is no
exception.
The Royal City of Susa ends this Sunday at the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York)

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME ARTS are live arts, and in recent decades a few creative artists have
taken that liveness to new extremes. Back in 1953, Merce Cunningham made an
audience draw cards from a pack to determine the order in which the sections
of his new work, Dime a Dance, would be performed. In 1980, Alan Aycbourn
began experimenting with a similar method - giving variable middle scenes to
his 1980 Sisterly Feelings; and later providing 16 different potential
endings to Intimate Exchange.
Now, in the second part of Ayckbourn's Mr A's Amazing Maze Plays, the
audience votes for which route little Suzy and her dog Neville take through
the vast and many-roomed house of the sinister Mr Acousticus. Down the
passage or into the music-room? Down into the garden or up in the lift? You
vote; they follow your poll. Later, as they escape, you are asked to help
them remember which route they came by: which proves much harder. And part
of the fun en route is that Mr Acousticus has stolen sound and misplaced it
 -so that the noises of the house are all topsy-turvy. Rats sound like
motorcycles; doors open like sheep baaing; a harp sounds like a drum.
The play, first shown in Scarborough in 1988 but now new to London, is
designated by the National Theatre 'for children (of 6 upwards) and
intelligent adults'. Its story shows us Ayckbourn in Roald Dahl vein. The
idea that sound can be stolen - even from the birds on the trees (wonderful
touch) - and stored and given to the wrong object recalls Dahl's BFG and his
bottlefuls of dreams.
Another nice stroke is the way Suzy first hears about the loss of sound. Her
sometime pal, the pleasant but exaggerating Mr Passerby, explains to her
that he used to be an opera singer until he lost his voice; and that his
current voice is nothing like his former one. 'Whenever there's an opera on
TV or the radio, I always listen, and try and see if I can recognise it.'
This is Ayckbourn making magically sensible nonsense in the tradition that
descends via Dahl from Lewis Carroll.
But does some of it sound a bit too sweet, too cute? Well, some of it is. I,
like almost everybody, loved Suzy's huge, silly, restless dog Neville (Adam
Godley) - though surely his bark should be louder. But Suzy herself (Judith
McSpadden) tended to be rather yuckily Andy-Pandy - and too goody-two-shoes
for comfort. Only Neville is charcaterised with any detail; the rest are
one-dimensional.
Two male narrators steer us through the story, and they are part of the
reason that Part One plods. Of the two six-year-olds near me, one perked up
only in Part Two - by which time the other had gone home. In Part Two,
however, you could hear six-year-old gurgles and excitement everywhere. Mr
A's Amazing Maze Plays means to show kids just how much more lively a live
art is than a screen one, but it comes close to underestimating its
audience.
At the Cottesloe; then goes on tour to Poole, Whitley Bay, Dartford, Oxford,
Preston and Coventry in April and May

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Muddle over Matisse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGHLY acclaimed exhibition Matisse 1904-17, which was scheduled to run
at the Pompidou Arts Centre in Paris until June 21, could be suddenly
curtailed following legal action by an 89-year-old Russian heiress.
Irina Shchukin has started proceedings to confiscate the catalogue of the
exhibition and have 25 of the 130 paintings on show removed. The works were
nationalised in 1918 with a decree signed by Lenin and were the property of
Irina Shchukin's father, Serguei Shchukin, who had commissioned the
paintings from Matisse for his Moscow home. The paintings, on loan from the
Pushkin Museum in Moscow and The Hermitage in St Petersburg, include
masterpieces such as the second version of 'La Danse' of 1910, and 'La
Conversation'.
Two court cases claiming reproduction rights and ownership were brought by
Irina Shchukin just two days after the exhibition opened on February 24. A
Paris court yesterday rejected the first case, in which lawyers pleaded the
heiress's right to control reproductions of the paintings bought by her
father before 1910. Legislation was passed in France that year
distinguishing between ownership of art and possession of reproduction
rights.
Trickier by far, however, is the case brought over Irina Shchukin's actual
property rights. Her father received no compensation from the Bolshevik
government. The Paris court must consider whether it is competent to act on
a decision taken in a foreign country such a long time ago.
Irina Shchukin tried to negotiate with the Russian government and museums to
recover the collection before the Matisse exhibition opened. The Pompidou
Centre sees her latest moves as a means of pressuring the Russians into a
reply. If she obtains satisfaction, she should drop her case. If talks prove
difficult, the Russians may withdraw the controversial works before the
court makes its ruling and possibly orders their confiscation on May 12.
'That would be a catastrophe because the Russian works are an integral part
of the exhibition. We would have to close. The affair could also dissuade
Russian museums from ever loaning works again - the descendants of the big
collectors all live in Europe and the US,' Marian Julien, the administrator
general of the centre, said. Russian authorities would in turn lose out on
services from western firms and museums, such as the sponsorship the French
petrol company Elf is providing for a Matisse exhibition in Moscow. 'I
understand the family wanting to retrieve possessions. But paintings are not
like a yacht or a building - they're part of the world's cultural heritage.'

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Passing fame - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAMOUS for Fifteen Minutes, that began on Radio 4 on Thursday, is typical of
Radio 4, where folk of transient fame are constantly held up for us to
wonder at. The point in this series is that the fame has worn out. Mark
Lester, the first exhibit, was the universally-loved Oliver in the film of
Oliver] in 1968, when he was eight. In an interview with Jenni Mills, he
told how he went on in films for ten years more, until the offers ended. He
spent his unexpected money, he says 'irrationally', has since done various
jobs, is now a trainee osteopath. Next week Jenni Mills talks to Diana
Gould, a PE teacher who once flummoxed Mrs Thatcher on a TV programme.
It is like clearing the wardrobe of old coats you thought so smart before
they wore out. And there are other coats on other hangers. On Sunday we had
Jack's Last Tape, an autobiographical tape made casually in his last days by
Jack Trevor Story, the successful hack writer - nothing much that he had not
told us already, it just had that Story label in it. In Thursday's Radio
Lives there was the player Jimmy Clitheroe whose 15 minutes are over. Radio
2's Star Quality coat on Tuesday, formerly worn by Evelyn Laye, was kept
happily wearable by the electronic mothballs that preserved its charm as
new.
Soundtrack (Radio 4, Thursday) dealt with fine people who will never make
any 15 minutes. The Bill for Service dealt quietly with the effect on the
police of the stressful events they meet on duty - a prisoner hanged in his
cell, the Lockerbie disaster, the Clapham rail crash and so on. There was a
plea for some kind of psychiatric debriefing. I thought the arguments
important and the police reactions admirable.
Not all drama comes from the BBC. On Sunday, Clyde 2 in Glasgow gave A Case
of Legionary's Disease, by Ewart Hutton, a police tale with a plot as
complex as a tartan. Gordon, a known crook, is given a new identity by the
police, so that he can lead them to the Miami Mafia folk who have Dollars
100,000 for him to launder. They also lend him Morag, a woman police escort.
In a quiet country place, they see a skull, said to be a Roman legionary's,
with a little hole in it and a used pistol round inside. Why was the skull
not smashed when this was fired into it? Because the skull's owner had been
no Roman, a former German, now Scots, explains. He was the pilot of a German
bomber that crashed near-by; he had baled out but been shot. The Miami Mafia
get an occasional look while the skull problem is examined, and then they
are shopped by Morag, by now pretty fond of Gordon. She was nicely played by
Louise Beattie, Gordon by John Bett, and Finlay Welsh directed. Good fun.
LBC's Images for the End of the Century (Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, 10
minutes each), by Damien Chalaud, was different. In a suite of recorded
chat, documentary extracts and archival recordings, it tries to map the 20th
century. But the instant images were not sharp enough; all we had was a
pincushion of events that did not relate to one another.
Curiously, what I have enjoyed most in Radio 3's 20s season is the Hindemith
Composer of the Week. It is not for me to analyse it, but I find much of it
lively and as individual in its way as Mozart - good material for Classic
FM. The Aldous Huxley stories I heard were good magazine stories, no more.
Of course there were good magazines then, where informed stories about the
arts might be expected. On Saturday, Richard Mayne's Dancing on a Tightrope,
an account of Cocteau, spread widely over the 1920s, taking in Stravinsky,
Les Six, Picasso, even Genet. He may have been considered as much a showman
as an artist in his day; but the plays and films remain as much part of our
time as of his.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Stage set for Antwerp - Antony Thorncroft finds the
new Cultural Capital of Europe looking a treat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT

<DATELINE>
   SO THE baton
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
some might say the poisoned chalice - is passed on. In the High Renaissance
Town Hall of Antwerp on March 26 Madrid hands over to the Flanders city the
sobriquet 'Cultural Capital of Europe'.
Antwerp must make of it what it can. Some cultural capitals, (Berlin,
Glasgow) are credited with using the arts to strengthen the long term
prosperity of the city; others (Dublin, Madrid) are reckoned to have muffed
their chances. Antwerp, city of Rubens, Van Dyck and Jordaens, a cocky,
attractive, regional metropolis, is taking its responsibility to culture
seriously.
The opening weekend says it all. The centrepiece production in the
beautifully restored Bourla Theatre is not some European classic by
Shakespeare, Moliere or Schiller, but a new play about Sarajevo, 'a lament
for a city' by the Bosnian director Haris Pasovic.
The mayor of Antwerp was not too pleased with the choice but the director of
Antwerp 93, Eric Antonis, has firm views on the need for the arts to provoke
society. He is not seeking large audiences for the 700 odd events in the
Festival. He just wants to make sure that the audience is challenged. 'The
arts are the research department for society. After 1993 I want the people
to agree that the arts have a place'.
Not that the opening weekend is didactic. To satisfy the popular appetite
for high culture a major show of the work of Jacob Jordaens, a earthy
contemporary of Rubens, is guaranteed to pack them in; there are classical
concerts in the churches; and the streets, to say nothing of the 2,000 bars,
will be heaving with wandering bands, embracing thousands of musicians. The
Antwerp poet Paul Van Ostayen wrote a poem in 1928 entitled 'The Occupied
City' and this will be writ large, literally, over a city besieged by the
arts, mostly al fresco.
There are two nicely contrasted strands to Antwerp 93. One looks outward,
exploiting Antwerp's position as the second port of Europe, a city which has
always been open to new ideas - and new conquerors. So there is a wealth of
foreign arts ventures. Not big name orchestras, nor national opera
companies, nor famous dance troupes, but projects like the Ark, a converted
barge which will be home and performance space to artists from 14 cities in
the grip of change like Los Angeles, St Petersburg and Marseilles. A young
director from each has been invited to bring over a team to devise shows
that convey the flavour of their current cultural life.
In the same creative turmoil Antwerp is commissioning four new operas,
pulling in contributions from composers, lyricists, designers, etc, who have
never worked together before. It is also planning to publish the work of 100
selected European writers, in many languages, converting intellectual
workshops into a permanent record, an expensive post-modernist folly. It is
commissioning 10 new sculptures for one of the city's parks. This is all
avant-garde stuff, but Antonis is keen to make things which 'would not be
done by others if we didn't do it'. This extends to early music: Flanders
enjoyed an intellectual peak around 1500, and polyphonic music features
boldly in the programme.
Of course the paymasters at city, region, and national level are worried
that Antwerp 93 might seem elitist. So Antonis is equally concerned to bring
it all down to street level, to make the festival's slogan, Open City, mean
something. 'The city will be the stage'. In and around a Berber tent erected
near the city centre there will be an opera with animals; there will be
giant screens showing movies; a children's village will be erected. While
committed intellectuals will pack the small venues the public will have the
arts, or at least an experience, brought to them in the streets.
This is the surface. Hidden beneath all this festival razzmatazz Antonis has
been bold - and raised some eyebrows, and concern. He is not co-operating
with the established cultural institutions in the city, the directors of the
opera house, the celebrated Flanders dance company, the art gallery. They
will be active anyway. He has upset the local politicians by extending the
Open City concept to cover Antwerp's architecture, including modern
developments. Architects will be encouraged to look hard and their findings
will be published. This could arouse controversy.
Antonis has brought together a team of outsiders, free from local influence
and traditional loyalties. His resources have gone towards new initiatives.
In the same way no new arts buildings have been constructed to act as a
lasting memorial for Antwerp 93. Instead the existing city has been given a
complete overhaul. More money, around Pounds 60m, has gone into this
refurbishment than the Pounds 19m invested in the arts programme. The
cathedral is free of scaffolding for the first time in 60 years. Antwerp
looks a treat.
It is unprecedented for a European City of Culture to be so removed from
political influence; to be handed over to an arts professional to do with it
what he will. Antonis, whose background is in running arts centres and
theatre companies, is quite happy for visitors to pour into Antwerp, and
around 3m are expected. But his first aim is to create a high quality
project which adds something to the arts and cultural life of Antwerp,
Flanders, Belgium and Europe. The project is its own reward. If it has spin
offs, they are likely to be in the continuation of the festival of
contemporary opera, in the unusual initiative of a festival of music for the
under-eights.
It is refreshing with such a big and costly arts venture to hear the old
certainties re-stated. 'We want to change minds. We are anti-commercial. If
the situation in the city improves as a consequence of Antwerp 93 that is
fine, but it is not our starting point.' The freedom of the artist to
challenge society is obviously alive and well in Antwerp.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: March of tasty extremes - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAN IT be that the video business is at last waking up to its own
possibilities? Over recent months, we have seen ever more appetising extras
packaged in with pre-recorded movie cassettes. Not just those trailers for
other features that precede films-on-tape and that resemble a trayful of
irrelevant canapes before the main meal. (Thank you, we do not want to see
five minutes of speeding bulletins about the new Schwarzenegger, Stallone or
Bruce Willis before settling down to Driving Miss Daisy).
No, I refer to what in a study course would be called 'supplementary
literature'. This includes mini-documentaries about the making of the film
you have bought or rented, such as are incorporated in the videos of Fatal
Attraction (CIC) and Hellraiser (Video Collection); original trailers of
historic films, as in Warner's new 'Special Collectors' Editions' of The
Searchers, Ben-Hur, Doctor Zhivago and The Alamo; and even boxed sets of a
director's work which include a book of his latest prose fiction. This last
startling package is available to Pedro Almodovar fans from Tartan Video.
As with the invention of databanks or TV information channels, now that
these ancillary attractions are on offer we wonder how we ever tolerated
video life without them. I have long maintained that the big screen is where
you should first see a feature film - shame on all you couch potatoes who
act otherwise - and the small screen is where you should re-enjoy or
re-study it. For that second experience, the more documentation and study
aids that arrive with the video the better.
Of course video is not all higher educative ground. Much of it is muck and
mire, and what month would be complete without such wares as are offered
this March? Delta Force 2 and Delta Force 3 (Chuck Norris saves the world
from another brace of apocalypses); Maniac Cop 3 (friendly neighbourhood
patrolman plus machete); Critters 4 (animated hairballs in space); and my
personal barrel-scraping favourite, The Finest Hour (20: 20). This
never-theatrically-released movie, which has Rob Lowe enlisting in Operation
Desert Storm and singlehandedly defeating Sadam Hussein, qualifies as the
mother of all zero-IQ action adventures.
Thus stretching its dynamic range to encompass both the sublime and the
ridiculous, video may be at last be an acquiring an interesting identity:
just as network television's range has spread over the decades so that it
now offers everything from Alpha to Omega, from Open University to
Neighbours.
For those not yet used to such tasty extremes, the middle-ground video
market continues apace and is about to have a good month. The following
films are accompanied by no 'mini-documentaries about the making of,' no
historic trailers, no accompanying paperbacks. Nor do they have the
Critters/Delta Force cachet of being harum-scarum potboilers hitherto deemed
unfit for human release.
But here are the March movies you might buy or hire for simple, uncluttered
pleasure. Housesitter (CIC), bright Steve Martin/Goldie Hawn romp about the
horrors of owner-occupation; 1492 (Guild), Ridley Scott's visually gleaming
Columbus epic; White Men Can't Jump (Fox), sex, race 'n' basketball comedy
from Ron 'Bull Durham' Shelton; The Crying Game (Polygram) - be your own
Oscar judge before the Oscars; Celine And Julie Go Boating (Connoisseur),
hypnotic French fable in which director Jacques Rivette goes Lewis
Carrolling; La Belle Noiseuse (Artificial Eye), second Rivette masterwork
with artist Michel Piccoli struggling with nude muse Emmanuelle Beart; The
Rapture, antic Armageddon allegory from Michael 'The Player' Tolkin.
Oh, and one other. Strictly Ballroom (Guild), the strictly hilarious,
strictly wonderful dancing epic from Australia that crept into nearly
everyone's Ten Best of last year and even into one colleague's Ten Best Of
All Time.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: City overflowing with art - Patricia Morison gets to
know Rubens and his compatriots better
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE are sadly limited folk for whom true beauty exists only in the piazzas
of cities beyond the Alps. But if your senses respond to the north, then
Antwerp is without question one of the most beautiful cities of northern
Europe.
This great maritime city on the Scheldt has its sombre side, its rotting
Renaissance facades and defaced Baroque Calvaries. Nonetheless, to my mind
Victor Hugo's judgment is spot on; 'The city is delightful: paintings in the
churches, sculpture adorning the houses, Rubens in the chapels . . . the
city is literally overflowing with art.'
In Hugo's day, Antwerp's dozen or so museums did not exist. Nor, of course,
did the city's newly restored Central Station and any number of
extraordinary late-19th and early 20th-century architectural extravaganzas.
Now there is Antwerp 93, and a notable group of exhibitions which will
ensure that the art-lover will indeed find this a city overflowing with
pleasures.
Perhaps the key fact of Antwerp's history is that as capital of the Spanish
Netherlands, it was held for Catholicism. Any visit should therefore start
at Onze Lieve Vrouwe, the largest Gothic cathedral in the Low Countries. It
has been under restoration for decades, but Antwerp 93 speeded the programme
up.
The entire interior is again visible, with Rubens's three wonderful
altarpieces, cleaned and conserved, displayed at the east end. From May 26
to October 3, the cathedral has an exhibition, Antwerp Altarpieces, the type
of 15th- and 16th-century pieces shipped out in staggering quantities for
churches from England to South America.
Any civilised visit to Antwerp must be partly about getting to know Rubens
better. An unusual exhibition at the Rubenshuis will shed light on the
running of the many highly successful artists' 'factories' of the day.
Rubens Cantoor (which means 'workroom') shows 80 copies of drawings by
Rubens loaned from Copenhagen. Most were made by Willem Panneels, who was
put in charge of the studio between 1628 and 1630 while the master was in
England and Spain (May 15 to June 27).
So intimate is the view of the artist conveyed by the famous Rubenshuis that
you will surely want to round things off with a visit to the Rockoxhuis, the
sumptuous Renaissance mansion which was home to Burgomaster Nicolaas Rockox,
Rubens's friend and patron. And of course, a pilgrimage is required to St
Jacobskerk. Above the wonderfully elegant tomb of the lord of Steen is his
last masterpiece, The Madonna with Saints.
Jacob Jordaens at the Museum of Fine Arts (27 March-27 June 27) is the
flagship exhibition of Antwerpen 93, celebrating 400 years since the
artist's birth. When gout carried Rubens off in 1640, Jordaens immediately
put up his prices. Over the next four decades of this artist's long career,
the Jordaens studio continued to be hugely successful even though its
master's talent declined as Rubens's never had. This should be the year and
the show to reevaluate Jordaens's achievement.
Antwerp: Story of a Metropolis at the Hessenhuis is a major exhibition
mounted by historian Jan van Stock to examine the image and the reality of
Antwerp's two first Golden Ages, in the 16th century and again in the early
17th century. Pride of the city throughout that period was the famous
printing dynasty of the Plantins. It is not only bibliophiles who find the
Museum Plantin-Moretus a place of rare fascination. So long as you are
prepared to peer, books, prints, letters and bills bring the political and
intellectual world of these centuries vividly to life.
Here, too, are portraits by Rubens, an intimate friend of the great
Balthasar Moretus. The Plantin-Moretus marks Antwerpen 93 by looking at the
scientific side of the humanist culture so important to Rubens and his
circle. Botany in the Southern Netherlands (13 March-June 13) comemmorates
the studies of the three great Flemish botanists, Dodoens, Clusius and
Lobelius, whose illustrated treatises were all published by the Moretus
presses.
Although its role in the Festival programme is small, the Museum Mayer van
den Bergh cannot be missed, for it is one of the most remarkable
19th-century museums in the world. Mayer Van den Bergh was a wealthy
connoisseur and art-collector. He never married - the story goes that he was
always looking for a girl with the face of a late-Gothic Virgin Mary.
Van den Bergh died in his early thirties. In 1904, his mother built the
exquisite neo-Renaissance mansion with its intimate rooms. Original cases
still house manuscripts, Byzantine and early medieval ivories, 12th-century
sculpture, coins and a fine collection of Nethelandish and Flemish
paintings. Few art-lovers realise that Breughel's chilling 'Dulle Griet' is
hidden away in the Mayer van den Bergh with his 'Twelve Proverbs', two of
only seven of the artist's works remaining in Belgium.
Diamonds enter the festival in Diamond Jewellery from Antwerp's Golden Age
(April 23-September 26). At the city's distinguished Ethnographic Museum,
there will be The Face of the Spirits: Masks from Zaire (September
19-December 31). The contemporary art programme has not been finalised but
summer will see openings at the Middelheim Open-air Sculpture Museum, the
Museum for Fine Arts, and the Museum of Contemporary Art.
A marvellous guide-book for exploring Antwerp is Derek Blyth's Flemish
Cities Explored (Bodley Head, 1990). It would be nice if in Antwerp's great
year of culture, every one of the chapels, mansions and gardens therein
recommended might indeed be accessible.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Arts: Power moves to Town and Country - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Town and Country is everyone's favourite London rock venue. Upstairs
there are half hearted delusions towards grandeur; downstairs is a snake pit
but with enough space at the back for voyeurs to watch the crazies pogo into
delirium while carefully avoiding a slippage on the slurped lager. Best of
all are the acts, a random mix of the up-and-coming playing their first big
concert and the 'whatever happened to's re-emerging from obscurity.
So when news came that the T &amp; C was to close on March 24 there was an
popular outcry. Now that the Kentish Town venue has been saved there is
muffled bemusement. The T &amp; C is a listed building, but the landlords, the
Murphy roadbuilding family and the heart of London's so-called Murphia,
seemed determined to get rid of the successful tenant of seven years, and
fellow Irishman, Mick Whelan.
The new tenant is Vince Power, also Irish and now boss of a chain of London
music venues, embracing the Mean Fiddler, Jazz Cafe, Subterrania, and the
Grand. He will re-open the T &amp; C as the Forum in late April with much the
same programme policy.
So what has all the fuss been about? Power expresses amazement. 'There was a
problem between tenant and landlord and the landlord wanted a new tenant.
Music fans should be rejoicing. We give cooler beer and hotter music in a
better atmosphere.'
Certainly Power has a successful track record. The Jazz Cafe, also rescued
from threatened closure, is now packed; the Grand in Clapham has overcome
licensing problems and opens on March 24; and in July he enters the tricky
area of outdoor festivals, at Long Marsden airfield near Stratford on Avon.
*
One of Christie's best sniffer-outs of considerable trifles, Simon
Dickinson, has left to work as a dealer in Old Masters. It was Dickinson who
identified Titian's 'Venus and Adonis', which the Getty bought for Pounds
7.5m, and his unerring nose for a masterpiece hidden behind grime and
over-painting will be much missed in the auction house.
A rich overseas backer obviously thinks that Old Masters will be the
Impressionists of the 1990s and is providing the millions to back Dickinson,
with partner David Ker. The firm will operate from premises in 58 Jermyn
Street but will be low profile and mainly deal with private clients, both as
buyers and sellers.

THE ORACLE AT STONELEIGH COURT
by Peter Taylor
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 14.99, 324 pages
UNTIL recently, Peter Taylor was one of America's most undervalued writers.
Born in 1917, he toiled in relative obscurity until just a few years ago,
when his novel A Summons to Memphis won a long overdue Pulitzer Prize.
Luckily for Taylor and his readers, this recognition was not a case of too
little, too late. As his latest collection of stories proves, Taylor remains
a masterful and surprising writer of fiction, a magician who is able with a
few deft strokes to conjure whole worlds out of thin air.
The worlds conjured in The Oracle at Stoneleigh Court range from the
supernatural habitat of ghosts to the more earthly territory of the Old
South. The collection's title novella introduces its central theme, showing
how the ghosts of a family's past can haunt and manipulate those still
alive. It tells the story of a young soldier who pursues a beautiful young
woman named Lila from their native Tennessee to Washington in the years just
before the Second World War. While there, he looks up an eccentric, elderly
aunt, a seer of sorts who lives in a stately apartment building called
Stoneleigh Court.
She soon insinuates her way into the lovers' relationship, bringing the
young man under her spell by conjuring the ghosts of his illustrious
ancestors while at the same time secretly causing the girl to abandon her
would-be lover by implanting ambitious dreams in her. The young soldier goes
off to war, where he wins the Medal of Honor for an heroic deed forever
blotted from his memory. He returns to Tennessee to convalesce, only to have
his aunt and Lila once again enter his life when the elderly lady returns to
her native home to die. He and Lila enter into a brief affair yet soon break
it off, realising that the aunt's meddling has made their love impossible.
It is a haunting story, typical of Taylor's work in its subtle evocation of
mystery and passion and loss. It sets the tone for the remaining stories,
such as 'Demons', in which a young boy realises that the disembodied voices
which populate his childhood must be forsworn if he is ever to become a man.
In 'The Witch of Owl Mountain Springs', a jilted young woman stays on to
haunt the posh Tennessee resort where her heart was broken, growing into a
backwoods hag until she can exact her revenge on the glamorous couple who
betrayed her.
In its more territorial offerings, Taylor's collection is equally assured as
he explores the fact that 'in the Tennessee country of my forebears it was
not uncommon for a man of good character to disappear'. For instance,
'Cousin Aubrey' tracks the strange life of a bastard son as he gradually
takes on the personality of his famous father. Disappearances of a far more
painful sort are the theme of 'In the Waiting Room', in which a group of
strangers come together in a Memphis hospital to swap stories of how they
have all been forced to abandon their old folk to death.
One of the most pleasing things about the book is Taylor's willingness to
tackle the supernatural straight on, to show how it can be a manifestation
of personal loss and guilt without for a moment denying that the voices and
ghosts that sound through this book are every bit as real as its more
tangible fictions. But, as in all of Taylor's work, the most memorable
achievement of this remarkable book is its careful and loving evocation of
the insular, complex world of genteel Southern society as it existed before
being eroded by the levelling forces of television and jet travel.
His old Memphis is a world where people take pride in their Confederate
General ancestors for the battles they lost; a world in which a pretty young
woman can be ruined simply by being publicly jilted; a world where a man's
way of overcoming bastard status is not to achieve fortune or fame but to
grow a magnificent goatee to hide his unfamilial chin. It is an antique
world but not a vanished one, not for as long as Peter Taylor is able to use
his uncommon skill and sensitivity to keep its ghosts and voices alive.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Books: Sex tangled with history - Fiction

<TEXT>
MEMORIES OF THE FORD ADMINISTRATION
by John Updike
Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 384 pages
ALFRED Clayton is a historian and the latest in the line of middle-aged New
Englanders to occupy centre stage in John Updike's slow fictional sweep
across the desperate lives of his American contemporaries. Asked by the
Northern New England Association of American Historians to contribute to a
survey of the Gerald Ford presidency, Clayton can only respond with a
chronicle of his disintegrating marriage, framed by Nixon's resignation and
Carter's inauguration.
He sifts painstakingly through his 20-year-old memories of his estrangement
from his wife Norma, the 'Queen of Disorder', and affair with Genevieve, the
'Perfect Wife', as well as detailing the other temporary liaisons that
littered that era. 'In his two years and five months of presidency', Clayton
observes, 'Ford presided over a multitude - dare we say millions? - of
so-called one-night stands.'
Alf is all too obviously left over from the the generation that had spread
its sexual wings in the 1960s; now in the AIDS-dominated 1990s he regards
those years with disguised nostalgia: 'Even the late Sixties had an
innocence, an oh-boy Barbarella forced cheer, counting off orgasms like the
petals of a daisy, which the thoroughly experienced Ford epoch lacked.'
If Alf's proper study is his own tangled sexual life, the topic of his
professional research is the presidency of James Buchanan whose place in US
history, just before the Civil War, seems as slender and inconsequential as
Gerald Ford's. As Clayton's memories unfold, however, they become entwined
with fragments of his unfinished biography of Buchanan; fact and invention
collide, giving the shape and purpose to Updike's novel.
Predictably it is Buchanan's personal life that fascinates Clayton, and
where the historical sources finally fail him he allows imagination to take
over. The parallels in the narratives are drawn ever closer as each makes a
fatal mistake: Buchanan dallies too long at a tea party and forfeits the
woman he loves; Clayton sleeps with the mother of one of his students, and
so destroys his relationship with Genevieve.
Memories of the Ford Administration is not great Updike, nor, one senses,
does it aspire to greatness. Twenty years ago he wrote a play around James
Buchanan's life, and the reworking of the material now in fictional form,
linking it into an exploration of the limits of history and the sanctity of
historical truth seems an uneasy one. In the roster of Updike's novels it
stands roughly midway; set against its 1980s predecessors, though, Rabbit at
Rest and particularly the wise and richly complex Roger's Version, it seems
thin on thematic detail and short on the transcendental moments, the sheer
bravura flourishes, that light up his finest prose.
Yet Clayton's regretful tone, his sharp awareness of spiritual loss and of
opportunities unfilled is undeniably poignant; like so many of Updike's
creations, he is a flawed man who has live long enough to become
unsatisfied. There is no consolation to be found here, any more than there
ever is in Updike. The mirror he holds up to the society he has tracked so
faithfully and for so long, has never been a perfecting one; Alf's world,
the author's world, is littered with loose ends and mistakes. History may
strive for perfection in the way that it packages the past, but real life
gave all that up long ago.

THANK HEAVEN FOR LITTLE GIRLS: THE TRUE STORY OF MAURICE CHEVALIER'S
LIFE AND TIMES
by Edward Behr
Hutchinson Pounds 18.99, 368 pages
LUCKILY we all remember Gigi otherwise Edward Behr's titles might suggest
that Maurice the Marvel was some kind of secret paedophile. It emerges that
he did prefer waiflike types of women to the more Rubensian ones, but they
had at least to have reached the age of consent. Among his innumerable
conquests were Marlene Dietrich, Josephine Baker and Kay Francis. But his
true love was, even after marriage, his old Mum. She was 36 when she had
him. Her no-good husband, Maurice's father, was a Parisian housepainter who
usually arrived home at night completely plastered (both senses).
Josephine Chevalier, with her pinched, pointy face, was of Flemish origin
known by Maurice and his brothers as La Louque, the name he afterwards gave
in her memory his magnificent estate in the South of France at La Bocca,
near Cannes. As a seamstress she was the family's breadwinner as well as
being a constant child-bearer (Maurice was ninth in the order). Jeanette
MacDonald, with whom he made movies for Paramount in his pre-war Hollywood
period - The Love Parade (1929) and Love Me Tonight (1932) - and who
absolutely loathed him (this revulsion being entirely mutual) said that Mama
was always Maurice's sole topic of conversation.
Behr's subtitle with its emphasis on the 'true' story implies that all the
previous ones have been untrue. Certainly the star's own nine volumes of
memoirs need to be taken with a large pinch of salt, but which theatrical
monster's memoirs do not? This new life, by a practised hand at contemporary
biography, is well-researched and especially strong on the political
background, enlightening about the performing arts in Paris during the murky
period of the Occupation. But the main story seemed familiar, after an
excellent Radio 2 biography, This Was Maurice Chevalier with recorded
extracts from several friends quoted by Behr, first broadcast in 1988
compiled by Charles Castle.
The working-class French lad's emergence as a dancer from the down and out
suburb of Menilmontant via the world of the Paris cafe-concerts and music
halls onto the stage of the Folies-Bergere is well documented. His earliest
partner was a crazy woman called Frehel. Luckily, young Maurice did not
succumb to her addiction to cocaine. Then he partnered the great Mistinguett
when he was 23 and she 36 and with whom he at once started a prolonged
affair.
He had found his metier and whatever later triumphs he enjoyed on the world
stage, Maurice remained au fond a French vaudevillian. He could never sing
especially well, but he radiated magic, through his panache, his patter, his
good looks, his mock-hesitant yet perfect articulation, equally well-timed
in both English and French. He excelled at manipulation of the audience for
whom he became an irresistible embodiment of sexy, gallic, garlic-breathing
allure.
The debonair look with straw 'boater' was adopted in the 1930s. Behr says
Maurice borrowed the idea of the hat as an essential prop from Harry
Richman, an American comedian whom he 'had almost certainly seen' in London.
Could not both of them have got it from the Claude Hulbert upper-class,
blazered, silly ass of the PG Wodehouse musicals and the Aldwych farces?
After Maurice appeared jauntily sporting this headgear, sales of English
straw hats soared across the Channel; like Dame Edna and her gladioli,
Maurice would distribute them to his admirers after the show. Apart from
such public relations munificence, paid for no doubt by the management,
Maurice was in private life congenitally mean, never picking up any tab in a
restaurant if he could help it, hoarding his huge earnings.
These remained vast for much of his life. He hit a bad patch in 1935, when
he broke with MGM and was forced to return to France to re-awaken his
dormant native admirers. Then came the Second World War. Maurice had been
wounded in the first and had been awarded the Croix de Guerre. As a result
of that he now became an ardent Petainiste. But did Maurice turn his
immaculately cut coat and perform at the behest of the Nazi masters in front
of German audiences? Did he in fact collaborate? After the Liberation his
reputation suffered grievously for several years from the stigma that he
had.
Behr goes into the whole matter carefully. Maurice does not emerge completly
spotless from the detailed investigation. He performed in Germany in a
French POW camp near Magdeburg which sparked the slander; but he seems to
have been hardly more culpable under the Occupation than Jean Cocteau,
Colette and a number of stars of that generation whom we now hold in
affectionate memory. Maurice's constant companion during the war - Nita Raya
 -was Jewish; he certainly helped her and her parents to survive it
unscathed.
After his eventual exoneration and return to Hollywood, the story has a
fairy-tale quality. Maurice is not just rehabilitated, he is glowingly
rejuvenated. 'I'm glad I'm not young any more' he sings with utter
conviction, not believing a word of it. His success was largely thanks to
the renaissance of the American musical, the lyrics of Alan Jay Lerner and
the direction of Vincente Minnelli. Leslie Caron, who played opposite him as
the ingenue in Gigi (1958), thought Maurice was a cold fish; but everyone
else was charmed by the 70-year-old matinee idol. He was right back on top
again.
But it could not last for ever, and by the end of the 1960s he was in a
Lear-like decline, fantasising about being elected to the Academie
Francaise, cutting his faithful female friend Janie Michels and her children
out of his will, manipulated by others close to him, a prey to suicidal
depressions with at least one actual attempt. By now he really had been
forced to retire; no one wanted to employ him, even on television. He died
aged 83 on New Year's Day 1972, a sad, lonely, cheated old trouper.
The book is highly informative, but it has been carelessly edited. The
irritating trick of linking two sentences by a colon, eg 'In America, things
were perhaps even tougher: In many vaudeville theaters, entertainment was
continuous . . .' proliferates; that cannot, surely, be Behr's normal way of
punctuating. If for economic reasons we have to suffer American spelling,
surely we do not have to have such illiteracy foisted on us as well?
The story about Maurice performing at the Waldorf Astoria during a
musicians' strike is repeated word for word on pages 317 and 318. It seems
incredible this error should have got right through to the finished book.
Walter Hutchinson and Robert Lusty must be turning in their graves.

different view of Henry Miller

<TEXT>
THE DEVIL AT LARGE
by Erica Jong
Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 16, 340 pages
SET ASIDE your prejudices, if you have any, about Henry Miller and Erica
Jong. In this account of her friendship with Miller, and of Miller's life,
views and literary achievement, Jong gives us robust insights into the life
of a writer and, more generally, the writing life. Miller might not have a
place reserved on Parnassus's peak, but when the topography of 20th century
literature in English is finally settled, he is assured of a place on - so
to say - its pistes. Jong's book gives us some of the better reasons why.
Shortly after the publication of her first novel, Fear of Flying, Jong
received a congratulatory letter from Miller. It was the beginning of a
friendship that lasted until his death. Partly because of Miller's support,
Jong's novel was rescued from the oblivion that first seemed its destiny.
Later, as if in repayment, she undertook to write his life. The task proved
insuperably difficult, because Miller had laid so many false tracks in his
voluminous writings and correspondence. In the end he told Jong that her
best chance of getting his story right was 'to make it all up'. She has done
the next best thing: she has mixed biography with literary criticism,
polemic, and reminiscence. The result is a curate's egg of a book: hastily
paced, especially when unsure of itself; sometimes hyperbolic; relentlessly
crackling with noisy one-line opinions; but always interesting and not
infrequently wise.
Miller is most famous, Jong rightly says, for his worst books: the Tropic
novels and other sexually explicit writings. But his best work, The Colossus
of Maroussi in particular, shows him to be the master of significant powers.
Miller was an artist, an ironist, a raconteur, and sometimes a very funny
writer. His language is pellucidly honest, and rises at times to a sinuosity
and strength reminiscent of Attic Greek. He is a prose Whitman of the 20th
century; and indeed acknowledges the connection, claiming America's great
confessional poet as his 'ancestor'.
Although his sexually descriptive books are not Miller's best, they
performed several important functions. Not the least was Tropic of Cancer's
legal victory in 1964 over censorship in America. This and other Supreme
Court triumphs, superintended in that heady liberalising time by the
reforming Justice William Brennan, unshackled American literature, making
Jong' s own work possible a few years later. For decades Miller had been
silenced by censorship in his own country; triumph over the stiflers of
expression was a sweet vindication.
Jong gives a brisk account of Miller's literary development, from early
disappointments in New York, through the finding of his voice in 1930s
Paris, to the wise evening of his life in California's Big Sur and the
Pacific Palisades. There is a strong smack of the creative-writing class in
Jong's appraisal, but it is fascinating and perceptive nevertheless. Miller
became at last able to write, she tells us, because he sloughed off the
desire to produce Literature, and discovered courage in that freedom. The
result was that he could write 'what none of the other books say'. His
exuberant language, his electric humour, his wonderfully surreal sense of
the poetry of things, refused to be squeezed into conventional forms. As
soon as he stopped trying, his difficulties were over.
Miller had many lovers, but the most important was Anais Nin. She was
stronger than he, and gave him his platform, materially as well as
intellectually. He was besotted, but she was having affairs with several
others simultaneously. Nevertheless she ascribed a pregnancy to him, which
ended in abortion. Later there was bitterness between them, but Miller
continued to believe that Nin's diaries are an outstanding literary
achievement.
Jong addresses the three questions which invariably arise in discussion of
Miller: his sexism, his treatment of sex, and his work's value. She defends
him against her sister feminists, remarking that he showed more charity to
women's writing than 'some feminist zealots, who judge every book against
some imaginary yardstick of political correctness and care for neither irony
nor imagination'. She applauds his part in liberating novelists from
prudery, but says that his revolution remains incomplete, leaving Western
culture still uneasily poised between mania and phobia about sexuality. And
she argues that although Miller's art is flawed, and that most of his books
are, in Norman Mailer's phrase, 'cakes which failed to rise', nevertheless
his experiments with the confessional voice and with 'spiral time' have been
a powerful influence on the shaping of modern American writing.
These judgments are sound, and offer a useful counterpoint to the response,
generally sceptical, that greeted Miller's recent centenary. Jong's account
performs a valuable service, therefore, in letting Miller have his due,
perhaps for the first time.

OFFICIAL AND CONFIDENTIAL: THE SECRET LIFE OF J. EDGAR HOOVER
by Anthony Summers
Gollancz Pounds 18.00, 528 pages
SO NOW we know. J. Edgar Hoover, who ran the FBI for 48 years and died in
harness in 1972, was a little bit more than the tough cop and master
bureaucrat whom eight presidents found useful and, whatever their
inclinations, unsackable.
He was, Anthony Summers tell us, not just a 'lifelong bachelor' but a
practising and licentious homosexual with transvestite manifestations. An
expert in the art of blackmail, he used his knowledge of John Kennedy's
sexual excursions with Mafia molls and other security risks to force JFK to
accept Lyndon Johnson, whom he also held in blackmail thrall because of his
affairs, as a running mate. He covered up Bobby Kennedy's association with
the death of Marilyn Monroe which got the young attorney general, with whom
he had a relationship of mutual loathing, off his neck.
It was not only the Kennedys. He knew of a Nixon liaison in Hong Kong and
that brought him security in office, even though he had long passed notional
retirement age and the White House thought he was going crackers.
But he was himself blackmailed, by the Mafia, which first catered to his
passion for gambling illegally on the horses and later used its knowledge of
his sexual inclinations as an effective shield against serious
investigation, not merely into organised crime, but into its involvement in
the assassination of John Kennedy. He was also personally corrupt on a
quietly impressive scale and probably a physical coward. Even his death -
officially in bed and of a heart attack - leaves the odd question
unanswered.
In fact, even if only half of what Mr Summers writes is true, he was a
monster. A lot of people considered Hoover a monster (and a racist) in any
case, for his hounding of every radical and mild dissenter, from Emma
Goldman through Alger Hiss to Martin Luther King. But this was tempered with
a certain respect for the Hoover legend and a grudging admiration for his
extraordinary ability to survive in the political jungle.
Summers, however, offers revisionism in the grand manner and he throws in a
few fashionable retrospective psychoanalyses as well. One of them concludes
that Hoover was suffering from 'a narcissistic disorder with mixed obsessive
features' not unlike the 'perfect Nazi,' Heinrich Himmler, head of Hitler's
secret police. In case the point is missed, comparisons with Stalin's Beria
are also made.
Summers, whose previous book was on Marilyn Monroe, offers impressive
research - 800 interviews and a huge bibliography - and an easy style. But
he is not the first Hoover revisionist. Less sensational and more political
analyses have recently been offered by Richard Gid Powers (1986) and Curt
Gentry (1991). Broadly speaking, Summers picks up on the private Hoover
where the other two, focussing more on the public man, left off. Both Powers
and Gentry note the constant rumours of Hoover's homosexuality, based on his
long relationship with Clyde Tolson, his deputy and constant companion, and
both conclude that the evidence is simply inconclusive. Summers finds it
everywhere, especially in the impressive eye-witness accounts of orgies that
Hoover attended (in New York's Plaza Hotel no less) by the widow of Lewis
Rosensteil.
This is another name to conjure with. Powers merely notes that Rosensteil, a
Prohibition-era bootlegger, became the head of Schenley Industries, the
distillers, while Gentry only parenthetically records Rosensteil's purported
ties to organised crime. Summers's sources delve much deeper, into
Rosensteil's own bisexuality, his connections, political and sexual, with
Joe McCarthy's clique, including Roy Cohn, and above all his closeness to
the Mafia's great financier, Meyer Lansky.
For years, Hoover refused to admit that there was such a thing as organised
crime. That it took the local New York police, not the FBI, to stumble in
1957 on the Mafia summit in Apalachin, has long been known as the great
clear blot on his record as a law enforcement officer, burnished early by
his artfully publicised 'successes' in nailing such gangsters as Dillinger,
Nelson and Karpis in the 1930s. Even after Apalachin, and again after JFK
was assassinated, his attempts to investigate it were suspect, Summers
maintains, because of the hold the Mafia, courtesy mostly of Lewis
Rosensteil, had over him.
Summers also digs up some fascinating nuggets with a British angle - for
example, that Hoover discovered that John Kennedy was linked, via one of his
many sexual encounters, to the Profumo affair in Britain, and that he had
the relationship between Harold Wilson and Marcia Williams (now Lady
Falkender) investigated and served on a plate to LBJ prior to a meeting with
the British prime minister in Washington. George Ball, then undersecretary
of state, described Hoover as 'a malign influence'. Robert McNamara at the
Pentagon told LBJ he was 'a menace' and should be fired.
But he never was, by none of the eight presidents, from Coolidge to Nixon,
that he served. He was given a state funeral, with a eulogy by Nixon, and
the monolithic FBI building on Pennsylvania Avenue, proudly bears his name.
Summers would have him confined to a metaphorical pauper's grave and he
makes a good, if sometimes too conspiratorial, case for so doing. At least
he never became president, though, incredibly, the suggestion was put to him
that he should run by a Kennedy - father Joe no less. It certainly makes you
think.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Contemporary art gets a foot in the door -
Nicholas Powell casts an eye over Europe's only works-on-paper fair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE salon du dessin de collections, Europe's only works-on-paper fair and
the only one in the world which shows drawings but not prints, has moved
this year from its cosy but crowded basement in the Hotel George V to the
far loftier Grand Palais. The deliberately uniform and sober style of
presentation - by Paris standards, at least - remains the same. But the
salon is booming and 24 dealers, compared with 17 last year, are presenting
a much wider range in twice as much space.
The salon, which proved an immediate success when launched in 1991, is still
a purely French affair, despite the eagerness of foreign galleries to take
part and the readiness of some of the younger Paris dealers to let them in.
Prices, meanwhile, are still an average 40 per cent down on what they were
before the 1990 slump.
Catering for Parisian taste as well as international collectors, the salon
has been top-heavy in the past with decorative Flemish and 18th century
French drawings and lacking totally in contemporary art. All that changes
this year with the defection of Northern School specialists Segoura and Bob
Habold, and the arrival of eight top Paris galleries specialising in modern
and contemporary work.
Gallerie Di Meo, Yvon Lambert and Louis Carre have all brought works by
their stables of artists. Pierre Brulle is concentrating on 1930s' drawings
by German artist Karl Hubbuch, while Gallerie Claude Bernard is showing
figurative pastels, watercolours and drawings by French painter Jacques
Truphemus.
Durand-Dessert is mounting a one-man show of recent watercolours by another
leading French artist, Gerard Garouste (priced from FFr30,000-100,000),
while Fanny Guillon-Laffaille is exhibiting drawings by Matisse from the
1930s and '40s, and watercolours from the same period by Dufy. Marwan Hoss
is showing a wide range of mainly unpublished works.
Priced at between FFr25,000-250,000, these include charcoals by reclusive
Canadian artist Riopelle; figurative and abstract works by French painter
Helion; drawings by the Uruguayan constructivist Torres-Garcia; and a series
of very rare drawings by Spanish sculptor Julio Gonzalez (Hoss organised the
retrospective of his work at New York's Guggenheim in 1983).
Newcomer Francois Perreau-Saussine, a 19th century specialist, has hung a
large-format 1959 Picasso ink drawing of a bullfight (price: FFr1.2m)
alongside his more customary Ingres, Degas, Millet and Barbizon school
drawings. Hopkins-Thomas has a stunning (and highly unusual) drawing of a
kitten by Manet in charcoal and white chalk; a very rare and highly
characterful 1912 cubist portrait of the poet and critic, Apollinaire, by
his Polish-born friend, Marcoussis, at just over FFr700,000; and a dozen
more affordable Vuillard pencil drawings of interiors at FFr20,000-60,000.
Those heavyweights of the international drawings market, Proute and Bayser,
again are showing a wide range of 16th to 20th century drawings while
keeping their most expensive works in the gallery - no one believes in
economic miracles. Nicolas Joly, who runs the works-on-paper department of
Galerie Yves Mikaeloff, is at the salon for the first time with 40 mainly
17th and 18th century works - including an early La Hire of 1620 and one of
the very few drawings by the 17th century French artist, Nicolas Mignard,
not yet in the Louvre - plus 10 early-20th century drawings by Andre Mare.
The French 18th century is represented by both Patrick Perrin, whose booth
is devoted to red chalk drawings, and Galerie Cailleux, showing works by
Jean-Baptiste Tiepolo, Fragonard and Greuze.
Galerie de la Scala has opted for a display of the themes of architectural
studies and portraits, including an exquisite charcoal sketch of a baby
(circa 1819) by Pierre-Paul Proudhon which his mistress, Constance Mayer,
used for her painting, Reve de Bonheur, in the Louvre. The studies are
mainly by 18th century artists such as Hubert Robert and Delafosse, and aim
at Parisian taste. They contain two recently-identified rarities: ink and
brown wash preparatory sketches of 1735 done by Panini for the decoration of
King Philip V of Spain's bedchamber in his residence, La Granja, near
Segovia. The other two drawings in the series, also combining
highly-elaborate architectural structures and scenes from the life of
Christ, are in the Prado.
Italian masters are represented by two dealers, Moatti and Baroni. The
former is showing 15 unpublished 16th century drawings, including
preparatory sketches for jewellery of 1560 by the Florentine school of
Francesco Salviati and a little-known Italian period drawing by Simon Vouet.
Baroni, a gallery which opened in 1991, has thirty 16th to 18th century
Italian drawings by the likes of Confortini, Cipriani and Cambiaso on show,
hoping to attract the eye of French museum curators.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Dealers hit back at the salerooms - Fairs
provide new ways to sell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOTHING divides the arts and antiques world more than the question of fairs.
Some of the grandest dealers, such as Wildenstein and Partridge, never show
at them. Others, like Waddington and Richard Green, travel the world circuit
constantly. Some dealers complain there are too many, often speculative
ventures by inexperienced operators; others cannot get enough of the
unpredictable nature of the events.
Undoubtedly, the recession has forced more dealers to attend fairs. It gives
them a feeling of activity, of trying new ways of selling. The arguments in
favour of fairs are impressive. You meet hundreds of new, or potential,
customers compared with the handful of daily visitors to a gallery. Many
sales at fairs take place months after the event, when contacts made there
walk into the gallery and become valued clients.
At fairs, you can take the pulse of the antique market, discover price
levels and, before the doors open to the public, pick over the stock of
competitors. Dealers tend to develop an eye for what will sell, so a picture
specialist will take a chance on some apparently under-priced porcelain or a
rug man might see potential in a grimy watercolour. Fairs also offer the
chance of good trade gossip.
Against these advantages can be set the cost. At the most glitzy fairs, like
Grosvenor House, a decent display space can cost a dealer Pounds 15,000, and
few cost less than Pounds 5,000. Olympia in June, the biggest with more than
300 exhibitors, charges around Pounds 9,000 for a reasonable stand.
Then there are hidden extras such as lighting and telephones, plus
transport, setting up and decorative costs, and the expense of getting
someone to man the shop while you are away. And there is the worry of
inviting your regular customers and watching them being enticed away by
other stand-holders, or finding that your stock is over-valued against the
competition. Above all, there is the tedium of sitting through a long day
being nice to strangers.
Fairs are enjoying a boom, though. Quite a few dealers no longer run shops
but work from home instead and use fairs to meet new clients and display
their wares. New promotion companies have emerged and, as other annual shows
disappear off the schedule because of the recession, the larger exhibition
halls are keen to open their doors to antique dealers.
On the surface there are too many fairs, but they seem to be creating their
own demand. When the art market recovers, selling through fairs, and from
home, could become the standard marketing approach.
One attraction of fairs is that they offer dealers a united, public showcase
with which to hit back against the auction houses. In the past three
decades, dominance of the art market has moved remorselessly from dealers to
the salerooms. Sotheby's and Christie's between them now account globally
for around two-thirds of all significant art transactions.
Now, though, the salerooms are in trouble and the dealers think they could
be set for a comeback. Sotheby's and Christie's pushed the art-as-investment
chimera too hard and, in a recession, are reaping the consequences of a
sharp decline in turnover by making minimal profits - or, in Sotheby's case,
actual trading deficits.
Surprisingly, the salerooms have moved to reverse the trend by raising their
charges to buyers. Few decent antiques come on to the market these days and,
if anyone comes along with a valuable collection, the salerooms compete by
offering to sell them for nothing. They can pay for such generosity only by
increasing the charges to buyers.
So, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips expect a successful bidder this year
to pay a 15 per cent premium on the hammer price instead of 10. Bonhams,
which was the only major London saleroom to raise sales and profits last
year, is holding its charge to buyers at 10 per cent and deserves to prosper
from its gamble.
The arrival of the 15 per cent premium offers a wonderful opportunity for
dealers. At one level it is terrible news, since they are the best customers
(both as buyers and sellers) of the salerooms. When the buyers' premium was
introduced late in the 1970s, the dealers tried to organise a boycott, but
failed. This time, the higher premium has been accepted with little outrage,
perhaps because the dealers think privately that it plays into their hands.
Their argument is simple. If, say, you inherit a long-case clock valued at
around Pounds 3,000 and want to sell it, an auction house will still charge
you 10 per cent (because you are a minor seller), plus other expenses such
as insurance, transport, catalogue photograph, etc. After a few months, you
receive something approaching Pounds 2,500 - that is, if it sells at its
estimate in the present depressed market.
But why should anyone buy the clock at auction if, on top of the Pounds
3,000 hammer price, you pay 15 per cent (plus VAT on that if you are a
dealer), pushing up the cost to more than Pounds 3,500. Might it not be best
for the owner to accept an immediate Pounds 2,800 offered by a dealer who
would then try to sell it, with a 20 per cent mark-up, for around Pounds
3,350?
By-passing the auction houses suddenly seems attractive to both buyers and
sellers. The dealers see their window of opportunity, and are fighting back.
There is another reason why the dealers think they can win back trade from
the salerooms. Along with raising the buyers' premium, the leading auction
houses have tried to save money by sacking staff, including experts. There
are good grounds for thinking that some objects sold in the salerooms in
recent weeks have been catalogued wrongly.
Certainly, dealers, especially furniture dealers, are convinced this is so.
It might mean that a dealer can pick up a bargain; it could also mean that
private collectors, attracted by the ease of buying at auction, have paid
over the odds for objects which are much less than the catalogue proclaims
them to be.
These two factors provide the favourable backdrop to the fair run by the
British Antique Dealers' Association at the Duke of York's Headquarters in
Chelsea in May. Ostensibly, it is to celebrate 75 years of the BADA.
Actually, it results from a feeling that the top dealers should offer a
united front and mount their own show.
That the BADA fair is being held at this time reflects some dissatisfaction
with both the exclusive Grosvenor House fair, which has room for only about
a quarter of BADA's 300-odd members, and the populist Olympia, which can
resemble a cattle market. Both these fairs take place in June, so BADA's
timing is provocative.
Some dealers will exhibit at all three fairs but, in the main, BADA's is a
challenge to Olympia. With BADA, it is cheaper for dealers to take space,
the goods come with the association's seal of authenticity, the catering
should be much better, and it has a mildly glamorous setting - in a marquee.
The 80 or so BADA dealers exhibiting cover the range and will offer works of
art priced between Pounds 100 and Pounds 100,000.
One fair by itself will not win back all the trade that dealers have lost to
the salerooms. But, certainly, while the wisest heads know that both parties
can prosper only by co-operation, there is a feeling that the auction houses
are pushing their luck.
If worries about their level of expertise continue, the best specialist
dealers must benefit. The problem is that there are dealers who have been
known to cut sharper corners than any auction house.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Queen Victoria still rules - Antony Thorncroft
thinks buyers are stirring from hibernation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the most famous of all Victorian images, Florence Nightingale
standing among the Crimean war wounded at Scutari, and Queen Victoria
visiting them in hospital in London, painted as a pair by Jerry Barrett,
sold at Christie's in London yesterday.
The dealer Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox acquired them on behalf of the National
Portrait Gallery, which already owns sketches of the paintings. Florence
Nightingale went for Pounds 188,500, at the top of its estimate, and Queen
Victoria beat her forecast at Pounds 199,500.
What is odd about the paintings is that they have not been seen in public
since they were exhibited at Agnews in 1859 and were bought there by a
forefather of yesterday's seller for Pounds 870.
Their fame is totally dependent on the subsequent engravings, which entered
millions of Victorian homes.
Also surprising is that little is known about Barrett. His artistic
reputation survives on just these two paintings which were commissioned by
Agnews who paid for the artist to visit the Crimea. It proved an excellent
investment.
This has been a good week for Christie's which on Wednesday sold the
celebrated miniature by Nicholas Hilliard of 'A man clasping a hand from a
cloud' for Pounds 177,500, way ahead of the Pounds 50,000 estimate.
The owner, the late Shakespearean scholar, Leslie Hotson, was convinced that
the sitter was Shakespeare himself, but the expert on Elizabethan
portraiture, Sir Roy Strong, has decided it is Lord Thomas Howard, later 1st
Earl of Suffolk.
Yesterday Christie's announced that it has concluded a private treaty sale
with the National Gallery of Scotland which transfers a drawing by Raphael,
'The Madonna of the Fish', into its safe keeping.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Arts Collection Fund
helped the Museum pay for the drawing by respectively giving Pounds 100,000
and Pounds 50,000.
Slowly the salerooms are stirring back to life: the main auction rooms at
Sotheby's and Christie's have been deathly quiet since mid-December.
But Sotheby's too this week announced a major lot for disposal, one of the
most celebrated, and last, watercolours by Thomas Girtin. 'St Vincent's
Rocks, Clifton' was painted in 1802, the year of his death.
It comes on to the market on April 1 and should make at least Pounds 80,000,
helped by the renewed interest in British watercolours fostered by the two
important exhibitions currently taking place at the Royal Academy and the
British Museum.
The Original Print Fair closed at the Royal Academy last Sunday and was a
great success.
It was always likely that prints, relatively cheap to buy but the work of
great artists, would help lead the art world out of recession.
There were 12 per cent more visitors than last year and all the 28 dealers
made sales, often to overseas buyers. But, as a sign of the times, it was
prints under Pounds 10,000 which changed hands most rapidly.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Maastricht -forget the treaty, enjoy the fair -
Susan Moore previews an event which, in only five years, has surged to the
forefront of the international fine art calendar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN JUST FIVE years, the European Fine Art Fair at Maastricht, Holland, can
claim to have established itself as the one truly international art and
antiques fair. Unlike the far more glamorous Paris Biennale, London's
Grosvenor House or Palazzo Strozzi in Florence, it is not a national fair
that simply invites foreign exhibitors.
Neither is it predominantly a 'floor' or 'wall' event. Maastricht - which
opens this year on Saturday, March 13 - has flourished on the department
store principle of shops within shops. Its fairs within the fair have always
placed equal emphasis on paintings, works of art and textiles. It is a
formula that seems to have worked. In 1989, the fair attracted 106
exhibitors (60 non-Dutch) and 17,000 visitors; by 1992, there were 144
exhibitors (93 non-Dutch) and the number of visitors had doubled to 35,500.
Maastricht's unlikely rise to pre-eminence - its roots lay in two small
provincial and biennial picture and antiques fairs which merged in 1985 and
re-launched three years later - is explained partly by its now-famous
location in an affluent and easily-accessible corner of Europe. The
relatively low costs of exhibiting at the functional (although camouflaged
generously with flowers) Maastricht Exhibition and Congress Centre has
alsocontinued to attract the trade: few dealers could afford to show
three-score pictures or a dozen wall-size tapestries anywhere else. Perhaps
the fair's greatest strength, however, is its restlessness.
Over the years, the formula has been honed endlessly by the 21 international
dealers who make up the board of trustees. There have been experiments with
Orangerie-style displays, exhibitions, lecture and concert programmes and,
most importantly, with a variety of new dealers and sections which have
either become fixtures or been dropped. The fair is not allowed to rest on
its laurels, and neither are the exhibitors.
There are more refinements and innovations this year - and even more drastic
ones planned for next. Last year saw the introduction of La Haute Joallerie
du Monde, and the jewellery boys are back. (Harry Winston follows his 1992
conversation-piece pair of ruby slippers, a la Wizard of Oz, with the
world's largest green diamond planted in a Garouda brooch).
The somewhat disappointing gravura section has been expanded to include
books, prints and maps, and the 20th century section is hoping to see a
much-needed improvement with the participation of London's Waddington
Galleries, which shows Picasso, and Amsterdam's Gallery Delaive, which
brings Karel Appel and Niki de St Phalle.
The major addition this month is an antiquities section. Board member Ben
Janssens explains: 'Last year, two very good antiquities dealers came and,
in terms of publicity, were extremely successful. We felt it was an area
that should be encouraged.' Exhibitors include HAC Kunst der Antike, the
Royal-Athena Galleries, Galerie Samarcande, Tradart, Kunsthandel M.
Zilverberg, and the Chinese antiquities dealer Gisele Croes, who is
exhibiting at Maastricht rather than the Salon de Mars.
There are some 25 new faces among the 160 exhibitors this year including
Partridge of London, Moatti of Paris, and Albrecht Neuhaus of Wurtzburg.
Some broaden the range of the fair still further. From Vienna, for instance,
comes glass dealer Michael Kovacek, bringing with him a fine, early-16th
century stemmed bowl emblazoned with the Medici arms. London-based Ermitage
specialises in Faberge and Russian works of art. Its managing director,
Alexander von Solodkoff, says: 'Maastricht seems to be the one truly
international fair, and our clients are international. Paris is for la
grande decoration, much less for objets d'art.'
Inevitably, there are many familiar faces among the exhibits themselves -
but they are not necessary any the worse for that. Heide Hubner, for
instance, brings an impressive panoramic river landscape by Phillips de
Koninck, from the Mountbatten collection and sold recently at Sotheby's; its
price tag is Pounds 900,000. Moatti offers the luminous and sensitive
'Portrait of a boy in a Persian costume' by Rembrandt's pupil, Jan Lievens.
Do not leave without taking a look at Neuhaus's outstanding silver and
silver-gilt table fountain by the Augsburg goldsmith, Melchior Gelb I.
Recent discoveries have also been held back especially for Maastricht. SJ
Phillips repatriates a silver-gilt cup dated 1691 that probably can claim to
be the masterpiece of Willem Zeestra.
The Royal-Athena Galleries introduce an unpublished Roman bronze of Ares
disarmed and overcome by love, a composition known previously only in
paintings and mosaics. It is only 4 in high.
Moatti presents a recently-discovered further fragment of Rubens' celebrated
altarpiece of the Gonzaga family in adoration of the Trinity: a portrait of
the young Prince Francesco Gonzaga. Happily for Johnny Van Haeften, his
sumptuous Willem van Aelst still life of dead game, illustrated in the
handbook, has turned into tombstone advertising. He says the mood among
exhibitors is 'cautiously optimistic.'
For Klaus Hubner, Maastricht has become 'the most important Old Master field
world-wide - there is nothing comparable.' Certainly, there is little
serious competition for the title now that London's distinguished Burlington
House Fair has been subsumed into Grosvenor House.
Despite spirited efforts by the likes of Colnaghi (not exhibiting this year)
to bring Italian Old Masters to cut a swathe through the ubiquitous Dutch
and Flemish flower pieces, landscapes and 19th century townscapes,
Maastricht remains predominantly a northern fair. Those in search of
southern bravura this year should turn to the Luca Giordano Nativity
belonging to a new Spanish exhibitor, Concha Barrios, and the Melendez
still-life chez Charles Roelofsz.
The one section that sees little change at Maastricht is textura. For five
years, its small and exclusive band of dealers has offered the finest
carpets and textiles to be found anywhere on the market.
Next year will see standards tightening even further as Maastricht is pulled
back into more manageable and rational shape. For years, the only major
complaint about this marathon of a fair has been its epic and
ever-increasing scale and labyrinthine floor plan. This year, however, you
are still advised to bring walking shoes and compass.
The European Fine Art Fair shows at the Maastricht Exhibition and Congress
Centre from March 13-21; weekdays 11 am-8 pm, weekends 11-6. Tickets for the
private view, fair and catalogue, and information on Sabena World Airlines'
50 per cent discount on all first and business-class flights for visitors,
are available from TEFAF. Tel. (31-73) 14 51 65.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Gardening: New light on England's lost Arcadia - Robin Lane
Fox is intrigued by a painted clue to the gardening styles of yesteryear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX and PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HOPE that garden history never becomes more popular than gardening, but in
the cold of the recent winds, I can understand why it might. If so, it will
still confront questions of scope and accuracy, one of which confronted me
at a recent exhibition of garden history, called An English Arcadia:
1600-1900.
This well-chosen exhibition took its final call in Bristol in the west of
England last week after five successful months in London and the US. Its
main aim was to raise funds and interest for the continuing restoration of
the garden buildings at Stowe in Buckinghamshire. The National Trust is
leading a campaign and nobody could quarrel with this undertaking, because
Stowe was at the centre of English landscape gardening during the 18th
century. Stowe, therefore, was in the forefront of my mind at the Bristol
Art Gallery, but a related problem soon dislodged it.
It is all very well to look at designs for grand fountains, grandiose arches
and enormous avenues, but what about the history of smaller gardens, owned
by people who led the commercial 'flower culture,' a characteristic of
England since the early modern period? What was happening in lesser gardens
with flowers while Vanbrugh and Brown were designing schemes which were far
too grand for flowerbeds or ordinary mortals?
So often, histories of gardening become histories of parks and grand
architecture with a separate list of contemporary flowers. Where are the
pictures of gardening as we now know it, apart from the handbooks and
nurserymen's lists which prove that it existed?
The answer seemed to be that the sources are very few. Nearly 20 years ago,
they were vastly increased by a fascinating group of views of small
mid-Georgian gardens in an old portfolio, found and identified by chance.
The pictures were designed by an able draughtsman, Thomas Robins, and they
showed the Georgian 'nouveaux' and 'nouvelles' sitting in gardens with
frilly white furniture, spotty planting and that eternal status-symbol, a
conifer.
What happened next or elsewhere, I often wonder, outside the background to
Jane Austen's novels? Few gardeners could afford the Grand Tour or were able
to obliterate entire villages and rivers: what about the family in a bijou
town house or the man with a modest garden?
On to the main show of Grand Arcadia: the Bristol Gallery had added some
local extras, one group of which made me stop in my tracks. Six small
watercolours show exact details of a town garden at 14, St James Square,
Bristol. Nowadays, the square has since vanished, but around 1810 there were
flowerpots, irregular flowerbeds, a summer house of Georgian elegance, a
long gravel walk and a staff of at least two in breeches. The picture above
also illustrates the compost heap, sensibly placed against a house with a
chimney for sterilising the soil.
The Bristol Gallery acquired these paintings in 1976. As they are
watercolours, they are not exhibited regularly and still look as if they
come straight from their artist's possession. They are an invitation to
wonder who lived at number 14 and drew this precise selection of snapshots,
showing a keen gardener's work in less than an acre.
Instinctively, I thought of a correspondent of Gilbert White, the naturalist
of Selborne. The Gallery's date of 'circa 1805' would be slightly too late,
but the man combined efficiency, observation and an air of experiment which
suggested a practical eye. It is hard to be sure, but some of the flowers in
his many flowerpots looked decidedly trendy, half-hardy exotics from
temperate climates: agaves were in evidence and the man kept a hothouse.
In 1979, the pictures were noted in Connoisseur by the art historian Kate
Eustace. Intriguingly, she referred them to a date around 1805 and to a
family called Pole, because they had been kept with a signed silhouette by
one T. Pole. She doubted if the T. Pole was himself the artist, although
local returns show that he resided in St James Square, in Bristol, from 1802
onwards, albeit not certainly at number 14. In one of the six paintings, a
lady is shown at a desk, inside a Georgian window whose view runs the length
of the garden's walled walk: was this lady, perhaps, the artist of the
sketches?
It all sounds intriguing, but I think that we can be more precise. Thomas
Pole is an important figure. His father had emigrated from the Exmoor
village of Wiveliscombe to New Jersey and his son was a man of science who
specialised in medical anatomy, especially of the female, and became a
member of the American Philosophical Society. He returned to England,
qualified as an MD and was known for his handbooks on anatomy, illustrated
by his own sketches. Furthermore, he was an active Quaker.
In 1908, a brief biography for Pole was prepared: the author tells that on
returning to England, Pole rode more than 6,600 miles on horseback to visit
fellow Quakers and their Friends' Meetings. This religious zealot and
accurate observer of anatomy was living in Bristol's Handson Square by 1802.
He remained an active citizen, bubbling with goods works: one of the best
was a school for poor adults who lacked education. His own speciality
remained the female anatomy, which had evidently shown him some remarkable
things. In 1792, he published his Anatomy of A Double Uterus and Vagina; ten
years later, we should picture him in Bristol, sitting (I infer) in number
14 and looking at a single garden walk.
My first instincts seem to be true. If this Pole owned the garden, he was
indeed a scientific man, forerunner of the surgeons, doctors and dentists
who are so keen on precise gardening and pruning nowadays. His career and
talents connect with the garden's qualities, its meticulous neatness, its
technology, its elegance and the collecting instinct which shows in the
masses of flower pots from the hothouse.
In 1908, his brief biographer remarked: 'Despite the strictness then
prevalent in the Quaker Society of Friends, a love of art remained with him
to the last and found expression in many watercolours, drawings of landscape
and architecture and silhouettes.' The garden and pictures at Bristol, I
suggest, are the work of this Quaker philanthropist. It was planted between
his long rides on horseback, made for the sake of Quaker contacts. To record
its appearance, Thomas Pole painted it exactly, plant by plant, view by
view.
The few figures in the watercolours are oddly proportioned and either
elongated or reduced. Would an anatomist have made this mistake? Art
historians have drawn the wrong conclusion: if you can draw parts and
details you cannot therefore draw figures as a perfect whole. This failing
does not tell against an attribution to Pole himself of our finest snapshots
of a garden in the late Georgian period.
In France, it would soon be the age of grand jardins anglais, of English
parks and lakes in the manner of Capability Brown. In smaller townhouses, we
now see, there were jardins anglais of a different quality, flower gardens
where men with curious minds grew plants by the hundred for display and
knowledge, where science and taste went hand in hand. Without these
watercolours we would underestimate them: I propose this identification in
the hope of future knowledge which some of you may have, and also as a
postscript from a sort of Arcadia where I, too, can picture myself.
Patricia Morison writes: Further to my article last week on city trees,
changes in the legislation have made the penalties for infringing a Tree
Preservation Order considerably more draconian, increasing the fine from
Pounds 2,000 to Pounds 20,000.
A Service of Thanksgiving for Arthur Hellyer MBE, former gardening
correspondent of the Financial Times, who died on January 28 at the age of
90, will be held at the church of St Stephen with St John, Rochester Row,
London SW1 on Monday March 22 at 2.30pm

FT  06 MAR 93 / Property: Serious planning makes dreams come true . . . -
Homes are available in France to suit all pockets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNING A home in France is a dream for many Britons. Now, with the advent of
the European free market, and with the Channel Tunnel set to open by the end
of the year, it is easier than ever to make the dream come true - even with
the pound trading at around FFr8.
There are many suitable properties for sale in France at prices perhaps 25
per cent below their British equivalents. They are in every size and state
of repair, from ruined byre to immaculate chateau. But do not let dreams
blind you to reality. If you are set on a French farmhouse or manoir you
must know why you want to go, how you intend to make a living and how ready
you are to adapt. Do you really love French life and culture? You may meet
your Waterloo if you are not clear about fundamentals.
Houses in France soared in popularity in the UK in the property boom of the
1980s. When UK prices were sky-high French homes offered both value  - they
often cost less than half the sum of anything comparable in Britain - and a
better quality of life, says Sarah Francis, of French property consultants
Sifex (071-384-1200).
You should decide why you are going long before you talk to a property
consultant, who will usually represent several agents in different parts of
France. Are you going to make a new main home? If so, you will be liable for
French income tax after six months, even though the UK Inland Revenue will
still treat you as resident and ordinarily resident in the UK. However, you
may be able to obtain double taxation relief.
If you are planning a holiday home what do you intend to do there? Ride,
ski, garden, laze around, write, cook, make wine - or spend all your time
doing the place up? How much help can you afford? How far are you from an
airport, railway station, ferry or the Channel Tunnel? What society - French
or expatriate - do you need around you - or are you a loner?
A driving holiday in France, letting these queries roll through the
subconscious in the intervals between degustation and sightseeing, is a good
start. If deciding is hard, do not feel pressured. There are plenty of
houses for sale in France, so there is no hurry to buy. Eventually, you are
bound to find something you like and can afford, from FFr100,000 (Pounds
12,550) to millions of francs.
In Paris, Philip Hawkes (42 68 11 11), a leading agent in chateaux, Paris
apartments and hotels particuliers, is offering an exceptional first floor
apartment in the Hotel Mansart de Sagonne, at 28 Rue des Tournelles in the
Marais, very close to the Place des Vosges. Louis XIV's architect Jules
Hardouin-Mansart, Comte de Sagonne (who gave his name to the mansard roof)
built the house for himself in the 1680s, and little has happened to it
since. It is a glory of polished floors, painted panelling and mirrors that
reach to an extraordinary group of ceilings painted by Le Brun, Mignard,
Coypel and other court artists.
This exquisite piece of old Paris has a guide price of FFr19m (Pounds 2.38m)
and is a Classe Monument Historique (or Listed Grade I). That entitles the
owner to more help than the cumbersome VAT relief rules for listed buildings
in the UK, Hawkes explained. The Paris flat qualifies for grants for work of
up to 75 per cent; the remainder is deductible from income tax. If the house
is open to the public, all expenses are deductible. If there is an entry
fee, then it is a business, which allows one to carry losses forward.
Some 120 km south of Paris Hawkes has the spectacular octagonal Chateau de
la Motte, complete with moat, swimming pool, tennis court and 66 acres, for
FFr25m. Cheaper, at FFr6.5m, is an attractive chateau in the Yonne, south
east of Paris, which has been in the same family for 23 generations - and
yes, it does need modernising - with handsome outbuildings, park, tenanted
farm, 340 acres and shooting. Cheaper still at FFr1.5m is a romantic small
chateau in the Lot owned by Roderick Galloway, Hawkes's correspondent in the
south west.
Near Vichy he has a 15th century manor that looks like the French country
idyll, with 62 acres, for FFr2.8m. In Normandy's Pays d'Auge (Calvados
country) another manor in the same half-timbered vernacular as its cousins
across the Channel is on sale for FFr2.7m.
At the top of Hawkes' list is the palatial 17th Chateau de Menou, halfway
between Sancerre (wine) and Vezelay (architecture and food) 210 km south of
Paris. Jacques Garcia, owner of the flat in the Hotel Mansart, has decorated
this house sumptuously. With a guide price of FFr38m, it is a place for the
seriously rich to take themselves back three centuries.
In Normandy, GAK Williamson (0962-734999) has an interesting range of houses
with many below FFr1m, including a farmhouse with plenty of outbuildings on
the edge of Domfront for FFr700,000. For FFr2m there is a charming 17th
century watermill and cider orchard in the Suisse Normande, an hour from
Caen, and another for the same price in the southern Charente, which would
make an attractive hotel or restaurant - or a fine family house. And at
FFr8m it offers the early 17th century Chateau Malitourne between Le Mans
and Tours.
Provence has always been popular and has houses to suit all purses. New at
the top end of the market is the grand 18th century Domaine de la Bastide
Vieille, at Besse sur Issole, with 120 acres of rolling countryside, 28 of
them vineyards producing 65,000 to 80,000 bottles of AC Cotes de Provence
red and rose a year. It looks like a dream house, especially the the dining
room, where you eat surrounded by trompe l'oeil.
Dreams may be easier to realise if you buy a house to restore. Williamson
has several in Provence at FFr500,000 or less and Coeur de la France
(071-254-4570) has some in the Cher and the Allier in the centre for around
half that, including working farms.
Sifex offers some attractive medium-size properties, such as a maison de
maitre in the Gers with 7.5 acres for FFr1.8m, and one in Tarn et Garonne at
1.65m, including a six-acre vineyard. In Lot et Garonne it lists an
authentic 12th-14th century chateau with three towers and new roof,
described as 'habitable in parts.' The chateau with 131 acres costs FFr2.8m.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Property: Hints on French home buying
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN POINTS to remember when buying a home in France:
1 The system
Title is recorded at the land registry (bureau des hypotheques). Plans of
land areas are kept at the land survey office (cadastre). The town hall
(mairie) oversees planning law, building regulations and local authority
requirements.
2 The lawyer
The notary (notaire) is an impartial law officer appointed by the Ministry
of Justice whose role in the purchase is mainly concerned with correctly
transferring and registering title to the property.
3 Differences from the UK
In France there is no need for a buyer's lawyer to be involved before
contracts are signed - meaning, no surveys, no searches and no inquiries
before contract.
4 The contract
No standard form. At least four variations, any of which may be offered by
the agent or notary. All will commit the buyer to some degree. Treat the
contract as a basis for negotiation. Do not sign blind.
5 Advice
Ask the notary what kind of contract it is. What does it commit you to? What
do you lose if you pull out? This could be the time to bring in your own
lawyer.
6 Precautions
Inspect the property. You buy as seen and approved, unless new. Check
boundaries against the plan from the cadastre. Area is not guaranteed. Could
rural tranquility be vulnerable to development schemes? Ask the town hall or
regional planning authorities.
7 Buyer's costs
a) Notary's fees. About 1.5 per cent to 2 per cent of purchase price. b) Old
property: stamp duty at about 7.5 per cent on top of price. c) New property:
no stamp duty but vat (TVA) at 18.6 per cent included in price. Ask who pays
the agent and how much - 5 per cent is usual.
8 Finance
Arrange early. The need, or not, for a mortgage will be a contract term.
9 Point of no return
If all is satisfactory, pay deposit, customarily 10 per cent, to the notary.
Sign and wait for him to tell you he is ready, eight weeks on average.
10 Completion
In person or by proxy, before the notary, when he has conducted legal
searches, cleared pre-emption rights, investigated title, calculated
transfer duty.
He holds completion monies. At completion he redeems any mortgages,
re-registers titles and keeps title deeds. You insure. Pay local taxes and
utilities.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Bugged by the system - Computing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN BROOKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I THOUGHT that the age of people putting too much trust in computers was
over. It seems this is not so - at least, not in the realms of local
councils.
On opening my mail the other morning, I had a shock. It was a letter from
the local council saying that I would have to pay the new council tax on an
unoccupied property. A property I had never heard of, let alone owned. I
rang the council offices.
'Yes, under the council tax we are required by law to collect taxes on the
property.'
'But I don't own the property.'
'Our computer says that you do. If you don't own the property why haven't
you given this information before?'
'I didn't know you wanted the information.'
'You must have known.' She was getting angry by now. 'We have written to you
many times before concerning this property. You just see fit not to answer
the correspondence.'
'I have not received your previous letters,' I pleaded.
'Look, Mr Brooker, I can understand one letter going missing, but not with
the regularity we have tried to contact you. You just don't reply]'
I could tell by her tone that the computer screen in front of her was giving
her the dates of all the letters sent. 'Where did you send the letters?' I
parried.
'To you, Mr Brooker, at your address.'
I decided I would take on a condescending tone to match hers. 'To which
address?'
She gave me the address of the property that was causing the concern. It
still had not registered that if I did not own the property and did not live
in the property, I was unlikely to have received any correspondence.
She still spoke with the same haughty tone. She had given up listening by
now.
'I don't own the property,' I told her, very clearly. 'I have never owned
the property. I have never lived at that address.'
'If, as you say, you don't own the property, then you will have to inform us
who does own it,' she replied.
I was getting tired of this conversation by now. 'I don't own a crystal ball
either,' I remarked. I hit a nerve.
'There is no need for that kind of remark. I have all the details in front
of me on the computer. If you have sold the property then you must tell us
who you have sold it to.'
'I don't own the property. I have never owned the property. I cannot sell a
property I don't own. Please] Just alter the information on the computer.'
'I cannot alter the information on the computer just on your say so, Mr
Brooker. If you care to write to us we will deal with your correspondence in
due course.'
The conversation was ended. I sat down at my computer and drafted a letter.
As I was steaming mad I made a few errors - which I corrected.
There is an old adage in computer terminology: if you put garbage in, you
get garbage out. If there is one group of council workers which understands
garbage, it is the refuse collectors. Perhaps it is these workers who should
be operating the computers within the Town Halls . . .

FT  06 MAR 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Putting roofs over the heads of
aces - Nick Garnett meets the people who house the globetrotting stars of
Wimbledon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICK GARNETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STARTING a small company without training, and dealing with an activity
about which you have no real knowledge, is hardly the best way to succeed.
Sometimes, though, it can work.
In the mid-1980s, Jane Cussons, a part-time actress and television producer,
found herself with another part-time job: driving players from hotels to
Wimbledon for the annual tennis championships.
Out of the blue, one player - New Zealander Kelly Evernden - asked her to
help in finding a house to rent for the following year's tournament. From
this off-the-cuff beginning, Tennis London was formed.
Operating from a rickety office up a narrow, creaking staircase above a
printer in London's West End, the venture is one of those little niche
businesses that provide useful supplementary income while rarely generating
enough to give their owners a full-time living.
Tennis London gets all its revenue from finding temporary accommodation in
houses and flats for people connected with the annual Queen's Club and
Wimbledon events: players, sponsoring companies, reporters and television
crews. For the year ending next month - which includes last year's Wimbledon
 -Tennis London handled Pounds 320,000 in rent, producing a fee income of
about Pounds 50,000.
A third of that is absorbed by running costs, leaving the two owners,
Cussons and Shelagh Shipley, to share around Pounds 30,000 between them.
For this, they work about three days a week - except in the period leading
up to and during the competitions - and can take a full break of more than a
month late in summer. 'No one else really does what we do,' says Cussons.
'There is lots of administration involved in handling short lets over such a
short period of the year and it is not worthwhile unless a property agency
is set up for it.'
The business took off only slowly and Cussons worked from home at first. In
1989-90, Tennis London earned just Pounds 11,000 from gross rents of Pounds
85,000 on 40 lets during the season. In this financial year, gross rents
almost four times higher were arranged on nearly 150 lets.
Cussons says the company has a close relationship with Queen's and the All
England club, which runs Wimbledon. Both recommend Tennis London to players
and the sport management companies that represent them - and usually arrange
their travelling and tournament living arrangements.
Much of the business comes from word of mouth. And while some estate agents
do handle short lets for Wimbledon, many others pass on enquiries to Tennis
London, which has around 600 flats and houses in Wimbledon and central
London on its register. 'Home-owners come to us and we now have more than we
require, particularly because of the recession,' says Shipley. 'Three years
ago, we had only one house in Somerset Road, Wimbledon, which is a very
select area. Last year, we had five.'
She scoffs at newspaper stories suggesting that some owners are raking in
Pounds 15,000 in rents for the two weeks of Wimbledon. The spread, she says,
is from Pounds 300 a week for a one-bedroom flat to Pounds 3,500 for the
best six-bedroom house.
Shipley adds: 'Even star players never pay more than Pounds 2,000 to Pounds
2,500 a week. Sometimes, owners read about these huge rental figures and
will not believe you when you tell them these are wrong. They think they can
get Pounds 2,000 a week for a three-bed semi.' (The real figure is more like
Pounds 750). Whatever the level, Tennis London takes a 15 per cent slice.
The company circulates a limited number of brochures with details of its
properties, but negotiates mainly by giving these details direct to players
and their agents via letters and fax. Players such as Andre Agassi and
Michael Stich find homes through Tennis London, but they do not need to
climb the creaking stairs first.
One of the company's particular problems is its seasonal nature: Cussons
employs an extra person from April to July and four others during the
tournaments, mainly to let people into their rented homes. Another problem
is coping with the inevitable crises that arise during tournaments: players
locking themselves out, washing machines flooding kitchens, lavatories
breaking down. With these in mind, Tennis London has a plumber on call.
There are, of course, other awkward moments. 'One flat-owner forgot to pay
his electricity bill and power was cut off for a day and a half,' says
Cussons. 'I went up to the electricity board office to pay the bill but the
tenant was not pleased.'
Tennis London's overheads are low: about Pounds 15,000 a year, including
office rent. Lacking business training, its owners use a standard Law
Society contract form for the lets, with a few additions suggested by a
solicitor.
Perhaps surprisingly, players cause few headaches. Cussons says: 'The most
important criteria is that properties should have pump showers, video
recorders and washing machines and, if they are staying in Wimbledon, they
like to be within walking distance of the tournament. South Africans and
Australians are real sweeties. Americans can be a little demanding about
accommodation.'
Shipley says that while many players and sponsors still prefer to stay in
hotels, she believes there is scope for growth. But the company occupies
such a small niche that the owners recently recruited a full-time saleswoman
to run a conventional house rental operation from the same office.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Revenue's stand hits varsity BES
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INLAND Revenue does not like business expansion scheme companies which
invest in university accommodation. As reported last week, its reaction to
the Johnson Fry companies which bought accommodation for University College,
London, suggests it is getting tougher as the BES nears its scheduled
demise.
The Revenue has interpreted the BES legislation in such a way that tax
relief would be denied, according to Johnson Fry's chairman, Charles Fry.
But this decision is not final and talks continue.
Johnson Fry argues that the decision to make a summer letting, which caused
the problem, was not the responsibility of the BES companies but of UCL, and
that the legislation refers only to matters under the control of the BES
company. It will pay the costs of any legal action, but it is worth noting
that sponsors do not guarantee that BES relief is available - although they
do undertake to act for investors in trying to ensure that it is.
The main lesson of the affair, according to John Spiers of BESt Investment,
is to avoid schemes where money is raised before the Revenue has granted
provisional approval. Whatever the Revenue's final decision, it has
succeeded in cutting back on university BES issues - Ian Pugh of Allenbridge
says three have been cancelled in the past week.
Meanwhile, BES companies proliferate. The following list, provided by
Allenbridge, shows only those with a contracted exit:
Airways III offers a Pounds 1.17 buy-back price after five years for every
Pounds 1 invested now. Buy-back comes from the Airways Housing Association.
A Priori Growth, sponsored by Neill Clerk, will buy repossessions for the
Britannia building society. Non-recourse loans are available for 74p per
Pounds 1 invested after six months, 78.31p after one year, 87.71p after two
years and 98.24p after three. There is no guarantee after 5 years.
Barratt Fixed Growth fund, sponsored by Capital for Companies and
underwritten by Lloyds Bank, has a five-year buy-back of 115p.
BESSA Bristol &amp; West, sponsored by Close Brothers, buys repossessions for
Bristol &amp; West building society. Non-recourse loans of 74p after six months
are available, with a repayment of 105p per share after five years.
BESSA Cambridge, sponsored by Close Brothers and underwritten by Barclays,
will buy accommodation for Newnham College, Cambridge. Six-month loans of
75p, and a five-year buy-back price of 110.6p per Pounds 1, are available.
Bulldog Premium Growth, sponsored by Charterhouse Tilney, will buy
accommodation for Bellway Homes. Non-recourse loans of 75p per Pounds 1 are
available from Barclays. Buy-back after five years is 112p per Pounds 1.
Govett Asset Builder IV will buy housing for Sanctuary Housing. Five-year
buy-back is 115p.
Homeshare, sponsored by National Westminster and Hambros banks, will buy
houses from NatWest. Six-month loans of 74p, and a five-year buy-back of
Pounds 1.08, are available.
Homes for Littlehampton, sponsored by Matrix-Securities, has a 5-year
buy-back of 117p.
House The Homeless V buys accommodation for the Peabody Trust. 5-year
buy-back is 115p.
The Leeds Permanent Flexible Options Growth scheme, the Portman Multiple
Choice Growth scheme and the Second N&amp;P Multiple Choice Growth scheme are
sponsored by Johnson Fry and offer the same deal as A Priori. Portman is
available now, the rest from Tuesday.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonuses cut again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH-PROFITS pay-outs were cut again this week as four more life companies
announced bonuses for the year, writes John Authers. Ten-year pay-outs were
cut substantially, while 25-year maturity values - the term most often used
for endowment mortgages - were less affected, reflecting the higher
proportionate impact which the last few years of mediocre investment
performance have had on shorter term policies.
Pay-outs include two elements added on to a guaranteed 'sum assured' -
reversionary bonuses, added each year, and terminal bonuses, added only when
the policy matures. Reversionary bonuses tend to reflect anticipated future
returns and have largely withstood cuts thus far, but the pattern for
terminal bonuses is more mixed.
AXA Equity &amp; Law, which announced a cut in reversionary bonuses in January,
has now altered terminal bonuses. Depending on when the policy was started,
some terminal bonuses have decreased slightly and others have increased.
Assuming monthly premiums of Pounds 30 were paid on an endowment policy
started by a 29-year-old man, ten-year pay-outs are cut by 7.3 per cent from
Pounds 7,263 to Pounds 6,732, while 25-year maturities fall by 2.6 per cent
from Pounds 62,426 to Pounds 60,777.
Eagle Star Life made greater cuts, of 12.7 per cent from Pounds 6,896 to
Pounds 6,019 for ten-year pay-outs, and of 2.7 per cent from Pounds 61,910
to Pounds 60,188 for 25-year pay-outs. Not all these cuts were because of
bonus reductions. In 1983, Eagle Star raised the premiums needed to cover
the guaranteed sum assured, which accounts for part of the ten-year pay-out
adjustment. Equitable Life cut ten-year endowment pay-outs by 7.6 per cent
from Pounds 7,811 to Pounds 7,217, and 25-year pay-outs from Pounds 53,444
to Pounds 53,067. Sun Life cut ten-year pay-outs by 8 per cent from Pounds
7,029 to Pounds 6,467; 25-year pay-outs remained unchanged at Pounds 47,575.

<TEXT>
HEADLINE Pre-tax profits from BTR, the industrial conglomerate, should have
increased from Pounds 917m in 1991 to comfortably exceed Pounds 1bn last
year, although about Pounds 50m will come from profits on disposals.
Analysts at Thursday's meeting will be interested in what benefits have come
from the integration of Hawker Siddeley, taken over for Pounds 1.55bn at the
end of 1991, and current trading conditions in the US.
BAT Industries, the tobacco and financial services group, is expected to
report annual pre-tax profits of more than Pounds 1.55bn, up from Pounds
1.05bn, on Wednesday. Interest will centre on whether recent strong growth
in cigarette sales can be maintained, and how Eagle Star is recovering from
the heavy losses it has incurred on mortgage indemnity policies.
The new management team at Hillsdown, which reports 1992 results on Tuesday,
is expected to take the opportunity to clear the decks with restructuring
provisions below the line and goodwill write-offs in the balance sheet
expected to total around Pounds 150m.
However, it is not thought likely to adopt FRS 3 for these figures, and
pre-tax profits are forecast at around Pounds 155m compared to Pounds 186.8m
in 1991. The promise of a maintained dividend, though, gives a yield over 7
per cent.
Full year results from RTZ, the world's largest mining company, due on
Thursday were foreshadowed last month when the group said there would be an
exceptional charge of Pounds 52m, compared to a Pounds 74m charge in 1991.
RTZ plans to adopt FRS 3. Net income, the line RTZ prefers to focus on, is
expected to rise from Pounds 308m to around Pounds 330m, after interim net
income was up from Pounds 154m to Pounds 158m. A maintained final is likely.
On Wednesday, Cadbury Schweppes is expected to announce pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 325m for the full year, up from Pounds 316.4m last time.
Trading profits in Britain and the US are thought to have finished the year
on a strong note, though group results will be checked by a Pounds 14m
exceptional charge for restructuring at the UK chocolate business.
TI, the specialist engineering group, is expected to produce pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 109m, up from Pounds 105.2m, and earnings of 18p, when it
reports results for 1992 on Thursday. The company has underperformed since
last year's acquisition of Dowty which has suffered from the deterioration
in sentiment in the aerospace industry.
Both GKN and T&amp;N, the motor components groups, saw profits bounce back in
the first half of last year as they reaped the benefits of cost-cutting and
overseas investment.
While full-year increases - to be announced on Wednesday - are expected to
top 30 per cent in both cases, questions will be raised about the state of
the German car market. As a counterweight, the news should be good on US
demand.
GKN is expected to report Pounds 125m, compared with Pounds 95m, while the
consensus for T &amp; N is Pounds 65m, against Pounds 49m. The former's dividend
should be roughly covered, but T &amp; N's will not be yet again.
The betting is that T &amp; N will nevertheless hold the payment. Apart from
loyalty to shareholders who have stumped up for four rights issues since
1987, it is likely to place some more shares to help pay for its latest
acquisition, in Germany.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Don't miss out on the benefits of
redundancy - In a new series, a look at your rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUNDANCY is affecting more and more people, with a growing number of the
nation's 3m unemployed being former executives. And while it might seem
calamitous, financially it is one of the better ways to leave a job.
Resigning or taking early retirement mean losing out on many benefits.
Before redundancy
If you suspect you might be made redundant, there are several measures you
can take in advance.
Peter Smith, of financial adviser Hill Martin - which specialises in
retirement and redundancy planning - says: 'People think they have no
negotiating power. That is not quite right.
'When an employer is making someone redundant, they want them out of the
door as soon as possible and sometimes they say 'yes' to something just to
get rid of them.'
Start by taking out your contract of employment and check the terms and
conditions, particularly the length of notice to which you are entitled. You
will then be able to ensure that pay-off terms agree with the contract. If
you belong to a union, trade or professional body, see if it has any
guidelines or advice.
Jenny Woolf, author of Redundancy: Coping and Bouncing Back*, suggests
taking full advantage of facilities offered by the company while you are
still employed, such as a medical check-up. If you have redundancy cover for
mortgage payments, check its terms and conditions. These protection plans
are becoming increasingly expensive while offering poorer value (see page
VI).
Redundancy negotiations
Statutory redundancy pay is the legal minimum which an employer is obliged
to pay and it is calculated on your age and length of service subject to the
current maximum of Pounds 205 a week. You qualify for statutory redundancy
payments only if you have been in full-time work for two years, or in
part-time work for five.
But many employers offer an ex-gratia payment. As long as your total
redundancy pay does not exceed Pounds 30,000 and is not made as part of your
conditions of service, it is tax-free. Anything over Pounds 30,000 will be
taxed under the pay-as-you-earn system which can mean top-rate tax of 40 per
cent on the excess. It can therefore be to your advantage, particularly if
you are over 50, to ask your employer to make part of the payment into your
pension scheme.
Hill Martin's Smith says this has to be done before you leave and Harold
Roberts, of Towry Law, a financial adviser which has produced a free guide
to redundancy*, warns that care must be taken not to exceed Inland Revenue
limits.
Remember that you are likely to be entitled to a tax rebate for the year in
which you were made redundant, since you will be taxed on the assumption
that you were working for the full tax year.
If, however, your termination date is near the end of the tax year, Smith
suggests asking your employer if it could fall into the next one. Your
income for the new financial year is likely to be lower than the previous
year, so you could be taxed at the lower rate on any excess over Pounds
30,000.
Smith also says that if you have ever worked overseas for your employer,
extra tax exemption could apply. You should seek professional advice in this
complicated area.
You might be asked to accept pay in lieu of notice, which would have the
added benefit of being tax-free. But Woolf warns that if you have redundancy
insurance, it might not pay out until the termination date. The same is
usually true of state benefits.
Make sure your employer pays for holiday entitlements which you have not
taken, and ask him to allow you to go for job interviews during paid hours.
Look at the perks which the company gives you and see if any can be
extended. Life assurance and medical insurance cease when you leave
employment, but Roberts says some employers may be prepared to maintain
policies for up to six months after redundancy.
Smith advises asking if the company carries a continuation option without
requiring a further health check. Try to see if you can continue medical
expenses insurance at a discount and without having to declare existing
health defects.
Trying to keep hold of the company car could be more difficult because of
its insurance. 'Many companies provide the company car for the period of
notice or provide a hire car at their expense,' said Roberts.
Some employers will pay for financial counselling and outplacement services
but, if not, ask for it. Finally, get your employer to put your redundancy
terms down on paper.
Once you leave
Unemployment benefit: If you have been a well-paid professional, you will
probably feel uncomfortable signing on but, as long as you have paid the
required National Insurance contributions and are seeking work actively, it
is yours by right.
One advantage - even if the present rate of Pounds 43.10 a week for those
under 65, plus Pounds 25.55 for adult dependents, is not too attractive - is
that NICs will be credited to you automatically, so you will not lose your
state retirement entitlement. Roger Taylor, of the Consumers' Association,
warns not to expect unemployment benefit immediately.
'Your entitlement will be affected by statutory redundancy payments, wages
due, holiday pay, refund of pension scheme contributions, and payments due
from your employer before you were made redundant,' he says. 'Any payments
above and beyond these are treated as payments in lieu. Work out how many
weeks' pay this is equivalent to. You will not be able to claim unemployment
benefit until this time is up.'
Claims cannot usually be backdated, which is another reason for signing on
as soon as possible. The benefit lasts for one year. If you have health
problems, Smith advises signing on for sickness benefit instead, since it is
non-taxable and payable as long as you are ill.
You might qualify for income support to help with mortgage interest
payments, ground rent and other housing costs if your total capital is less
than Pounds 8,000 (including capital held abroad). But if you have been made
redundant recently, you will probably have too much capital.
'If you dispose of the capital, you will not be entitled to benefit if the
DSS considers you deliberately got rid of the capital to qualify for income
support,' says Taylor. 'Paying off your mortgage might also count as getting
rid of capital.'
You should also tell your local authority, as you could be entitled to a
lower community charge. Roberts says that if your children are in higher
education, the local authority grant will be reviewed.
Finally, if you have a mortgage, contact your building society and your bank
manager to let them know what has happened. 'Many building societies have
special schemes to help the unemployed and the same applies to your bank,'
says Roberts.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Data boost for small investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE investors who want to make their own share selections often face one
big problem: lack of information. While institutional investors are deluged
with reports from brokers, individuals must make do with what they can glean
from newspapers and specialist magazines.
This week, Sharelink attempted to fill the gap by launching a range of
products aimed at informing the small shareholder. Clients can choose from a
number of services, including:
Buy/Sell Guide. This will show the consensus recommendations of analysts on
650 companies. Companies are rated on a scale of 1-9, with 9 ranking as a
strong buy and 1 as a strong sell. The cost of each report is Pounds 2.95;
it is available weekly.
Company reports. These give 12 pages of information on a company, including
financial ratios, performance record and analysts' forecasts. The cost is
Pounds 4.95 per company (more than 600 are available).
Performance summary. Details for 650 companies of price, high and low for
the year, price-earnings ratio and gross yield (which are in the FT every
day), plus NAV per share, gearing, and performance details. This costs
Pounds 4.95 and is available weekly.
Telephone service. For a subscription of Pounds 30 a year, investors can get
access to the latest consensus buy/sell recommendations of brokers.
All of this information is useful, although some is available elsewhere: the
Investor's Chronicle gives details of brokers' recommendations while
financial information on companies can be obtained from their annual
reports, which most will send free. (A special FT scheme, detailed on our
London Share Service pages, gives access to reports from 340 companies via a
phone call.)
But what makes the Sharelink service so attractive is that such a wide range
of information is available at a low price. If you are willing to invest
Pounds 5,000 in a company, it seems worthwhile spending Pounds 4.95 to get
as much information as you can before you take the plunge. Those who want
more information or want to order a plan can call Sharelink (from Monday) on
021-200 4600.
Alternative services may have more details but are more expensive. The
Estimate Directory, published by Edinburgh Financial Publishing (which
produces our table of directors' dealings), shows the individual forecasts
of leading brokers for each company.
It is much bulkier than Sharelink's service, weighing in at 500 pages, but
information on more than 1,000 companies is available. These reports are
Pounds 35 individually, while quarterly reports are Pounds 105 a year (if
paid by direct debit) and monthly reports are Pounds 350. Further details
from Edinburgh Financial Publishing, 1 Rothesay Terrace, Edinburgh EH3 7UP,
or call 031-220 0468.
A different kind of service, aimed at those investors who are frequent
traders, was launched this week by FT Cityline and Hutchison Paging. The FT
Cityline pager is a bleeper service which allows the investor to keep track
of his portfolio.
Investors can state pre-established limits for share prices on companies
which they hold; if the share price breaches those limits, the bleeper will
sound within a minute and a telephone number will be displayed. The investor
can then ring to get more details.
The 24-hour service costs Pounds 159.99 for the first year and Pounds 99
subsequently. Calls to the FT Cityline cost 48p per minute (36p off peak).
For further information, ring 0800-282826.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Fixed-rate mortgage offers - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Halifax has launched a fixed rate mortgage for first-time buyers of 6.25 per
cent (APR 8.3) until June 30 1995. The fee is Pounds 200 and one
insurance-related product has to be taken out. Other borrowers can fix at
6.49 per cent (APR 8.1) for the same period and fee. Halifax is also
offering a 7.7 per cent fix (APR 8.3) until June 30 1998. The fee is Pounds
250. Loans over 75 per cent of the value of the house will attract a higher
fixed rate. All offers are portable after February 1 1994.
New portable five year fixed rates of 7.99 are available from Leeds
Permanent and Woolwich. At Leeds (APR 8.3), the fee is Pounds 250, but two
insurance related products must be bought if a life policy is not taken out.
It is available on all types of mortgage. The Woolwich rate (APR 8.4) is
only available on endowment and pension mortgages for a Pounds 275 fee.
There are early redemption penalties.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Bank charges probe demanded - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Nigel Griffiths, the Labour party's consumer spokesman, this week called on
Michael Heseltine, Conservative trade and industry secretary, to investigate
banks' charges after revelations that Royal Bank of Scotland has put staff
on an incentive scheme to maximise revenue from charges to customers.
Performance Plus was introduced on a trial basis from February to April and
sets a target for each branch to raise its collection of charges for items
such as returning 'bounced' cheques. Each branch has a second target to
increase the number of customers opening savings accounts. Employees at a
branch which meets one of the two targets will receive Pounds 40 a quarter,
and those at a branch which meets both will get Pounds 100.
Royal Bank of Scotland said it had identified a 'significant amount of
leakage' caused by staff failing to impose standard charges. The Consumers'
Association said that the news was worrying given the number of mistakes
made by banks on customers' statements.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Britannia's guaranteed return - At a
Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Britannia Building Society has launched a new guaranteed account which has a
three year period, shorter than most other guaranteed products. However, the
method of calculating the investor's gain is quite different; rather than
the rise in the FT-SE 100 over the years, the investor's gain is 112.5 per
cent of the difference between the average of the FT-SE's level one, two and
three years hence, and the original level. So if FT-SE starts at 3,000 and
reaches 3,200, 3,400 and 3,600 in successive years, the gain will be around
15 per cent. The gain is net of basic rate tax; non-taxpayers can reclaim
the excess.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: House prices still in downward
spiral - At a Glance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
House prices are still falling, according to monthly indices from both the
Halifax and Nationwide building societies. Halifax showed a small
seasonally-adjusted fall of 0.3 per cent in February compared with the
previous month, with UK house prices 7.2 per cent down over the year to
February. Nationwide recorded a larger average fall of 1.4 per cent in
February with an annual fall of 6.4 per cent. However, both societies were
cautiously optimistic. A spokesman for the Halifax said: 'The small size of
declines in January and February could be an early indication of stability
returning to house prices which we expect in the spring.' Tim Melville-Ross,
Nationwide chief executive, said price changes tended to lag sales activity,
which had been increasing.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: Honourable mentions - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHN MAJOR'S reform of the honours list encourages everyone to suggest
potential honorees. Here are this column's nominations:
Lord Schlesinger of Hesse. For services to the London stock market above and
beyond the call of duty. By first hinting at a German rate cut over the
weekend, then appearing to rule it out, then finally delivering a
quarter-point cut in money-market rates on Friday, Helmut Schlesinger,
president of the Bundesbank, provided exactly the sort of flirtatiously
delayed consummation the market likes. Shares in London set not one but
three FT-SE 100 closing highs in response, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
closing the week at 2,922.1, up 54.1. The Mid 250 and SmallCap indices also
did well.
Sir Andrew Buxton. For services to builders, suppliers of mobile phones,
makers of gold-plated Rolls-Royces and tailors of alpaca overcoats.
Barclays' dismal results on Thursday illustrated just how lavishly the bank
Andrew Buxton chairs has indirectly subsidised these businesses over the
past five years: of the Pounds 2.6bn charged for bad or doubtful loans in
1992, Pounds 800m were to property developers, and they spent every penny of
it. Lest anyone think that Buxton merely lucked into this award, we reprint
alongside what Lex said when the bank made its infamous rights issue in
1988. This was a planned disaster.
Brian Pearse CBE. For services to amnesia. By delivering Wednesday's healthy
results at Midland (pre-tax 1992 profits up 394 per cent to Pounds 178m) he
has managed to make everyone forget that he was Barclays' finance director
at the time of the 1988 rights issue.
John Birt OM. For services to Companies House. By channelling his pay
through a private company, the new director-general of the BBC produced a
surge of revenue for the companies registrar, as newspapers rushed to
commission company searches on every media executive they could think of.
Sir Christopher Hogg GCVO. For services to corporate governance. After
advising the Cadbury committee (main recommendation: companies should
usually split the roles of chairman and chief executive) he retired as
non-executive chairman of Courtaulds Textiles - leaving Martin Taylor, chief
executive, to combine the two titles.
John Ashcroft BEM. For services to the insolvency courts. Most people
restrict themselves to one corporate bankruptcy per recession; he has
managed two. Coloroll, which collapsed in 1990, is still fresh in the memory
of its shareholders; now Ashcroft's recovery vehicle, Survival Aids, has
also gone under.
The Bundesbank was not the only motive force behind the stock market's
strong performance this week. Shares seemed to benefit from a virtuous
circle of improving expectations. The recovery from the recession seemed at
last - falteringly - under way. Evidence for this came not just from an
upbeat Treasury bulletin ('Retail sales rose strongly in January . . .
demand and activity in late 1992 appear to have been, if anything, a little
stronger than the autumn statement assumed'), but also from less parti pris
quarters. House-builders, for example, reported new home sales up by a fifth
in January and February.
The stock market has anticipated this trend for some months, as the chart
shows. It contains a couple of ad hoc unweighted share indices, constructed
by the FT's Keith Fray, containing 30 'cyclical' companies (including BOC,
Taylor Woodrow, Emap, ICI, and Rolls-Royce) and 30 consumer-product
companies (Glaxo, Granada, Tesco, Unilever and so on). In late 1992, the
recessionary trend - which favours the defensive consumer stocks against the
cyclical ones - came to an end. Since then, cyclicals have significantly
out-performed.
To UK investors, the recovery may thus be old news. But the growing
likelihood that the UK will be the EC's only big economy to show any sort of
growth this year, coupled with a belief that the pound is safely off its
lows, has tugged continental and American investment institutions into the
market. Give 'em all OBE's]

FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: Good news on jobs fails to dispel bad mood - Wall
Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US stock markets were in a distinctly bloody-minded mood this week. Take
yesterday's employment figures. The monthly jobs data are the most
closely-watched economic indicators in the statistical calendar; so the news
that non-farm payrolls soared by 365,000 in February (three times the
markets' expectations), and that the unemployment rate fell unexpectedly
from 7.1 to 7.0 per cent, should have given share prices a substantial lift.
After all, one of the main concerns that has troubled investors lately has
been the failure of jobs' growth to keep up with the accelerating pace of
economic activity. Yesterday's report showed that employment growth could be
picking up at last. The Bureau of Labour Statistics said it was clear from
the data that the jobs market had 'strengthened considerably' in February.
Yet, the figures were all but ignored by the stock markets. Two hours after
the data was released, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just three
points - and other key indices were lower. The dollar, meanwhile, seemed to
like the jobs news: it rose against both the D-mark and the yen on foreign
exchange markets.
At first glance, there seemed to be an obvious explanation for the stock
markets' response. The news of the big increase in payrolls sent bond prices
into a tailspin. The benchmark 30-year government issue dropped more than a
full point, pushing the yield up sharply to well over 6.8 per cent.
Equity investors do not react well when interest rates go up, and for good
reasons. Higher rates increase the cost of capital for companies and the
cost of loans for consumers. They also threaten to undermine the
competitiveness of exporters by inflating the value of the dollar.
This explanation, however, does not ring true because the stock markets have
not been taking much of a lead from bond prices recently. Over the past two
weeks, equity investors chose studiedly to ignore a remarkable bond market
rally that sent yields down to record lows. So, why should they suddenly sit
up and take notice when the bond market takes a turn, probably temporary,
for the worse?
Was there was another explanation for why the jobs figures failed to lift
stock prices? One suggestion was that investors were disappointed by the
meagre growth in manufacturing payrolls. The headline number might have
risen by 365,000 last month, but manufacturing jobs increased by only
10,000. Even this does not make sense, though, if the employment report is
scrutinised closely. While manufacturing jobs' growth was disappointing, the
figures showed that the manufacturing work-week rose sharply last month and
that overtime reached the highest levels seen in 36 years. Instead of taking
on new workers, employers asked their existing labour force to work longer
hours.
Moreover, while manufacturing jobs' growth may have gone nowhere in
February, companies in the services and retail industries added thousands of
new workers to their payrolls - more than 250,000 new jobs were created in
the two sectors combined.
Admittedly, the majority of these were part-time, but any increase in the
number of people working is good for the economy. And part-time workers earn
money just like full-time workers - money that can be ploughed back into the
economy.
Perhaps the stock markets were taking their cue from the White House, which
bent over backwards yesterday trying to play down the significance of the
big rise in payroll numbers. An army of big guns - including the president,
labour secretary Robert Reich, commerce secretary Ron Brown and Senate
majority leader George Mitchell - was trotted out to say that the good jobs
figures certainly did not mean the economy no longer required help from the
government.
Wall Street's economists disagreed forcefully. As Ed Yardeni, chief
economist at CJ Lawrence, put it: 'Message to Washington: Kill the
short-term fiscal stimulus programme. It isn't necessary.'
So perhaps that was it. The stock markets did not like the jobs news because
investors were worried that, with the economy recovering strongly enough on
its own, the Clinton package of fiscal stimuli will lead to an overheated
economy, rising inflation and higher interest rates.
If this was the real explanation, it reflected a remarkable turnaround in
stock market sentiment. When the president unveiled his package in
mid-February, share prices plunged because investors feared his measures
would retard, not promote, economic growth. Two weeks is obviously a long
time on Wall Street.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: The high costs of 'good' advice - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROUND of applause to the British investing public for seeking out
Cazenove's bond and utility fund, which had low initial and annual charges
and yielded 7 per cent if held within a personal equity plan. Cazenove says
it has raised Pounds 24m; and, although some of the money came from
fee-charging financial advisers and some from the firm's own clients, the
bulk came from small investors.
Fidelity's new income fund, which has a lower yield and higher charges than
Cazenove (but still relatively low fees by industry standards), has raised
Pounds 15m, mostly from the public. But, of the three funds launched last
month, the most money - Pounds 45m - was raised by M&amp;G, which had the
highest charges of the three. Its initial charge is 4.5 per cent (0.8 per
cent all told on Cazenove), and its annual charge is 1.5 per cent (0.5 per
cent at Cazenove).
M&amp;G is not being greedy. Its front-end charge is higher than the others
because of the commission it is prepared to pay to those who sold the fund.
And it says it raised around 30 per cent of its money from independent
financial advisers and 70 per cent from the public.
The industry can produce as many arguments as it likes for the present
system of commission charging, but these recent fund launches show its
absurdity. More than half of those who acted on their own opted for the two
funds with higher yields and lower charges; those who took 'advice' were,
almost exclusively, put into the fund with the lowest yield and the highest
charges.
You can hardly say that advisers have favoured M&amp;G's fund because it offers
monthly income; Fidelity's does, too. Some could argue that M&amp;G's offering,
with its higher equity content, might produce better long-term growth in
income - although the income will have to grow 40 per cent to catch up with
Cazenove while coping with a bigger annual charge.
Many contend that charges are irrelevant in the long run; what matters is
performance. All well and good, except for two things. Future performance is
unknown when an adviser makes a recommendation; the charges are set out
clearly in black and white. Second, if two managers buy exactly the same
stocks, the one with the lower charges will produce the better return.
Buying the fund with low charges tilts the odds in the investor's favour.
So, I find it hard to believe that it is sophisticated analysis, and not
commission, which has pushed advisers in favour of M&amp;G.
It has to be said that Fidelity, while having a lower charging structure, is
offering the same 3 per cent commission as M&amp;G; but Cazenove is not paying
commission at all. One financial advisory group I met recently said it was
not even mentioning Cazenove to its clients, because it would get no money
for recommending the plan.
Many independent advisers do a good job for their clients; it is better that
investors approach them than tied agents. But the system is still crazy.
Imagine the outcry if newspapers wrote only about those companies which
advertised on their pages.
The guidelines for financial advisers published last month by the Financial
Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (Fimbra) state
quite clearly: 'Members must take care to ensure that their recommendations
are made on the basis of the client's best interests and not on the basis of
the income generated for the member.' Judging by speeches from Andrew Large,
chairman of the Securities and Investments Board - the industry's chief
regulator - he appreciates that the public is not being served well at the
moment.
At the FT, we have favoured advice based on fees rather than commission. We
believe that paying the adviser yourself is the best way to ensure he acts
in your interest and recommends the best products. But our view is not
popular in the industry. Commission-based advisers argue that many investors
are unwilling to pay fees, and that they have to earn a living somehow.
We still believe that many FT readers will have had experience of paying a
fee to solicitors and accountants, and will be prepared to do so to an
adviser. And if the public is unwilling to pay fees, the more newspapers
tell them to do so, the quicker they will come round to the idea.
Many investors will prefer to rely on their own counsel, but those who do
need to keep on their toes. One alert reader received a mail shot from
Sharelink giving him the chance to invest in one of two indexed funds via a
personal equity plan. Sharelink's special Pep offer involves an initial
charge of just 1.5 per cent plus an annual charge of 0.75 per cent on the
Pep.
But the sharp-eyed reader noted that one of the plans chosen was Gartmore's
UK index fund, which had no initial charge and an annual fee of just 0.5 per
cent. The effect of the Sharelink offer was to dilute one of Gartmore's key
advantages - its low charges. Furthermore, the Gartmore fund is available
via a Pep from London broker WI Carr for just Pounds 30, plus VAT, a year.
In its defence, Sharelink points out that it is making the fund available to
small investors (the minimum lump sum is Pounds 250, compared with
Gartmore's normal Pounds 5,000); that investors can switch into the European
index fund for free; and that the overall charge levels are still low.
Nevertheless, the special offer is not so special for those who want to
invest the full Pounds 6,000. But only a well-informed investor could have
worked that out.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: What Lex said about Barclays' 1988 rights issue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The sheer scale of the appetite for capital of the London clearing banks
never ceases to amaze. But even so, Barclays' Pounds 921m rights issue,
coming only three years after it raised Pounds 507m, is breathtaking both in
its size and its arrogance. Here is a bank whose performance over the last
few years has been modest at best, asking shareholders to stump up the
equivalent of more than three years of retained earnings to enable an
aggressive new management team to embark on an untested growth strategy.
If Barclays had been a US bank trying to sell this message on Wall Street,
it would have been almost certainly shown the door. Fortunately for
Barclays, shareholders on the east side of the Atlantic appear less
concerned about dilution of earnings and net asset value, and seem to have a
trusting faith in the management's ability to put the money to good use.
Nevertheless, the sharp sell-off in bank shares yesterday signalled the
general unease with Barclays' pre-emptive strike. UK banks, which account
for less than 5 per cent of the total market capitalisation, have accounted
for nearly a fifth of the total equity capital raised in the UK over the
last five years, and their appetite shows no sign of abating. Now that
Barclays has announced that it wants to dislodge NatWest from the top spot,
it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the latter might return for
another monster slug.
Barclays argues that it needs the extra money to boost its market share. But
given the stage in the economic cycle, this might not be the best time to
begin pumping even more credit into the UK economy. Barclays had the worst
bad debt experience during the last recession and credit quality is one of
the first casualties of any bid for increased market share. But at least
Barclays will soon have plenty of capital to cushion itself against its
future bad debts.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Markets: A tricky calculation over Barclays - The Bottom
Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS almost become old hat for British banks to make losses after a decade
in which first Third World debt went wrong, and then a reckless lending
spree at the end of the 1980s led to huge bad debt provisions. But Barclays
still caused a stir this week with its first ever pre-tax loss in 96 years.
Barclays has had an uncomfortable relationship with some larger shareholders
since it said it was appointing Andrew Buxton to the twin posts of chairman
and chief executive from this January. Some fund managers argued that Buxton
should split the roles, as he has now promised to do.
But the decision this week to halve its final dividend to 6p per share,
cutting Barclays' total dividend for 1992 by 28 per cent to 15.15p, raised
fresh questions about whether the stock is worth having. It might even have
made some depositors question whether their money was entirely safe.
The second question is easier to answer. Barclays remains an extremely
well-capitalised bank by international standards. The bank actually managed
to increase its overall ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets to 9.1 per
cent despite recording a loss of Pounds 242m before tax for the year.
This is well above the 8 per cent ratio that the Bank for International
Settlements has set as a safe minimum for any bank to ensure funds are
well-secured. Barclays' ratio of core capital such as ordinary shares fell
to 5.5 per cent of risk-weighted assets, but is even further above the BIS
minimum of 4 per cent.
But if the bank's borrowers and lenders face little risk, its shareholders
face a more tricky calculation. The first problem is the future of the share
price. Barclays' shares underperformed against the FT A All-Share index
during 1992, falling 12 per cent from January to December.
A growing market conviction until this Thursday that the dividend would be
maintained helped raise the price to 433p before it fell nearly 10 per cent
on the dividend cut. Shares recovered yesterday as the market absorbed the
notion that Barclays had prepared itself for recovery.
The second problem is the dividend yield. The cut reduced the yield sharply
from 6.5 per cent on Wednesday to 5.2 on Thursday. Shares were yesterday
trading at a gross yield of 5.02 per cent compared to 5.4 for National
Westminster.
The answers are hard to assess because Barclays' results next year are
themselves uncertain. If the bank has set itself on the way to solid
recovery and the reduced dividend is safe from further cuts, then some
analysts argue the sheer size of its recovery potential means it is a good
long-term bet.
Julian Robins, of BZW, who predicted a reduced dividend, is recommending
holding Barclays' shares. He predicts a Pounds 300m pre-tax profit for 1993,
and a yield of 5.2 per cent.
The contrary view is that Barclays has done itself little good by bolstering
its tier 1 capital at the expense of its dividend, and the strength of
recovery is unknown. Buxton says he recommended a cut dividend because he
could not predict how far bad debt provisions would fall.
Tim Clarke, bank analyst at Panmure Gordon, says NatWest shares are now
appealing compared with Barclays. He believes the uncertainty over Barclays'
recovery means the gross yield should be half a percentage point above
NatWest. 'NatWest looks stronger, and is recovering earlier,' he says.
The calculation between the two banks thus comes down to how firm Barclays'
recovery will be in 1993 and whether it will need its stronger core capital.
A brisk economic upturn - bringing a sharp rise in loan demand, and recovery
in property prices - would help tip sentiment towards Barclays.

FT  06 MAR 93 / The Long View: Breaking the banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are a banker the hardest thing can be to live up to your image. When
the Royal Bank of Scotland introduced, in these competitive times, a Pounds
400 a head staff bonus based upon the level of extra charges that could be
squeezed out of customers, the bank seemed surprised that this was at odds
with what the customers expected. That friendly bank manager is not just in
a cupboard, he has long since taken early retirement, to be replaced by a
financial product salesman.
During the 1980s the cosy banking cartel was already collapsing but the
monetary boom carried the UK's credit institutions up to wonderful but
dangerous new peaks. The cost has subsequently become evident in huge bad
debt provisions: thanks largely to this week's dreadful results from
Barclays, aggregate provisions of the Big Four clearing banks have climbed
to Pounds 5.8bn for 1992, against the already staggering Pounds 5.3bn for
the previous year.
Only during the past year or so has the size of the banking industry more or
less stopped growing, as measured by the broadly-defined money supply, M4.
Over the past year it has risen by 3.1 per cent; for the past two years it
has grown only roughly in line with nominal national income. In the 1980s,
however, M4 grew by 16 per cent a year, driven by deregulation, by a
political desire to finance a huge expansion of home ownership through the
short-term credit market, and by attempts to restrain the economy through
high interest rates which diverted long-term savings into the banking
system.
Ten years ago M4 was numerically about 50 per cent as large as national
income, today it is more than 80 per cent. Is this shift, as the Treasury
has been inclined to argue, simply the natural result of deregulation, and
therefore benign, or does it indicate a huge misallocation? The scale of the
economic misdirection of the late 1980s in property and elsewhere, and the
subsequent bad debt write-offs, would indeed suggest a large element of
distortion. The collapse of some of the agents of this miscalculation, the
banks, would seem appropriate. But because they are a protected species this
is not allowed (and in countries like Norway and Sweden they are being
propped up by the state).
That much is common ground: collapsing banks would create still greater
mayhem. But a more dangerous dogma is now being promoted by the monetarists,
that the banking system must not even be allowed to shrink. The real money
supply must keep growing if there is to be economic recovery. The already
bloated banks must be kept expanding, somehow.
Not even the banks appear to believe wholly in this doctrine. Brian Pearse,
Midland's chief executive, has said, please, may the banks at least be
allowed to opt out of small business lending, which has proved to be such a
disaster? Unless, of course, the government would like to offer a subsidy .
. .
Indeed, it is hard to see how the banks and building societies can sustain
their deposit volumes. The aggressive search for viable borrowers in the
1980s proved to be self-defeating. The company sector as a whole halted its
net borrowing from banks back in 1990, and can now easily finance itself
through the equity and bond markets. The overhang of debt-financed
commercial property will gradually be mopped up by long-term corporate and
institutional investors. The personal sector is the most overborrowed of
all, and although household mortgage debt continues to rise slowly, most
individual borrowers are keen to reduce their debt.
This leaves the public sector as the banks' only saviour. The Americans,
remember, have already taken the route of selling large quantities of public
sector debt to their own banking system, to shore up their profits and
balance-sheets (though even so broad money has contracted). But for this to
happen in the UK there will need to be created a large gap between money
market interest rates and the yields on two- to five-year securities. At
present this gap is much too small. Money market rates would have to be cut
to 4 per cent, in which case sterling would tumble, or alternatively there
would have to be aggressive sales by the authorities of short-dated gilts at
yields of about 7 1/2 per cent, in which case the stock market would be
vulnerable, and the private sector would be damaged.
In any event, if the power of the banks is left unchecked they will
inevitably undertake a further damaging charge in some wrong direction or
another. When the banking herd stampedes it is guaranteed to generate a
self-fulfilling boom, then a self-destructive bust. Lord Alexander, chairman
of NatWest, blamed the damage done to the banks by extreme economic cycles
without drawing the lesson that the banks themselves were largely
responsible for the economic overheating.
The banks will not this time gallop into Third World debt or small company
finance - history does not repeat itself so precisely. In fact the next
danger area is likely to be insurance: the banks' involvement began with
life insurance, but judging by the plans of Abbey National this week a move
into general insurance underwriting may follow, including the self-insurance
of mortgage indemnity risks.
Do the banks understand these non-banking risks, given that they failed to
comprehend the risks of property lending or small business finance? The
banks should stick to their core business: processing simple financial
transactions, dull though that may appear. Their non-executive directors
should say so; otherwise, in a few years, they will all feel as embarrassed
as the non-execs at Barclays have been this week.
It is not just that your banker is sizing you up as an unsuspecting mug
punter who can earn him bonuses. It is that respectable bankers in their
dignified parlours repeatedly act as reckless gamblers. Those monetarist
economists should draw the conclusion that a falling M4 might not be such a
disaster after all.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Russia, the country that lost its soul to vodka: John Lloyd
reads an extraordinary book that purports to be a history of the national
drink but is actually a lament on the passing of socialism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Officials have found a uniquely Russian use for a nuclear power plant (at
Nizhny Novgorod). They plan to turn it into a vodka distillery. . . But many
townspeople are furious, the Tass news agency said. Nizhny Novgorod has
plentiful supplies of liquor but is desperately short of heating.'
 -Reuters from Moscow, February 5 1993
FROM THE reign of the tsars to the fall of communism, vodka has been part of
Russia's life. It is said to have been invented by monks there. It was
celebrated for its exquisite purity on the old estates, and standardised for
socialist mass production. It then became a symbol of despair, mass
drunkenness and inefficiency during the decline of the Soviet Union. Now,
author William Pokhlebkin - in an extraordinary book called, rather
misleadingly, A History of Vodka - has turned the story of the 'greatest
drink in the world' into a lament for the passing of socialism in his
country.
The story began in the 1970s when the Soviet state was faced with challenges
from foreign vodka companies. They claimed Soviet producers could not call
their product vodka because the drink had first been marketed elsewhere well
before the Soviet monopoly was established in 1923, following an early
post-revolutionary ban. But this challenge was seen off relatively easily.
Poland made a more serious claim early in the 1980s when it said vodka had
been developed during its 18th century imperial period, when the nation
stretched from Silesia to western Ukraine and north to Lithuania. Shaken,
the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade asked experts to prove Russia was
first. It turned for help to the Institute of History and the Higher
Scientific Research Institute of the Fermentation Products Division of the
Central Department of Distilling of the Ministry of the Food Industry. They
failed.
Enter Pokhlebkin, a communist of the old regime who, as a civic duty,
undertook 'objective historical research.' The result is this book.
Without question, the cold simplicity of vodka is an invitation to toss a
glassful down the throat and wait, eyes watering, for the lovely blast in
the stomach as the liquor explodes. It lacks the subtleties of whisky and
the bourgeois splendour of brandy but, in its craggy purity, it stands on a
peak of its own. It is worth a defence. Pokhlebkin provides that - and more.
He goes about his task rather as an objective Soviet examining magistrate
would have described the state's case against a dissident before proceeding
to take the 'evidence.' According to Pokhlebkin, western leaders were behind
the first challenge, mounted in 1977 just before the 'triumphant
festivities' celebrating the 1917 revolution's 60th anniversary and the
adoption of the new Soviet constitution. This was done in order to 'take the
gloss off the birthday of Soviet socialism.'
The Polish attack was worse, coming from a fraternal state. But, in
Pokhlebkin's words: 'Only now, more than a decade later, has it become clear
to everyone that there was nothing accidental, or even purely commercial,
about the Polish action. Anti-Soviet factions had long been gathering
strength in Poland. They were closely linked with various reactionary
circles in Europe and America, and it was obvious even then that they were
acting as agents for the western 'vodka kings' For the Soviet foreign trade
organisation, the situation was both unexpected and thoroughly unpleasant:
our people were not accustomed to disputes with allies.'
Pokhlebkin's knowledge of history appears not to include the invasions of
Budapest and Prague but he is better on earlier periods. He says the first
alcohol available in Russia was wine, imported from Byzantium and Asia Minor
from the ninth century. Mead, a stronger drink brewed from honey, became
widespread from the 12th and 13th centuries when wine stopped coming. When
honey supplies eventually ran short, kvass, a grain-based mead, became
generally popular. Pokhlebkin notes that it became 'more powerful and
stupefying' by the end of the 14th and beginning of the 15th century - in
one case, in 1382, causing the surrender of Moscow to besieging Tartars
because their promises of gentle behaviour were believed by the drunken
defenders.
Pokhlebkin claims vodka was first produced in a Moscow monastery between
1440 and 1470, and believes this dating can be deduced from a correct
reading of the socio-economic conditions at the time. Only when alcohol
could shake off its identification with ritual and religion and become a
commodity in a money economy; only when the state required a convenient
vehicle for taxation; only when the state itself developed the apparatus for
enforcing a monopoly on the drink; only when the ruling class was
sufficiently intelligent and ruthless to use vodka to influence social
policy - only then, within a grain-based agriculture, could vodka appear.
It did - and 'acted like an atomic explosion in the stagnant calm of
patriarchal feudalism.' State-employed innkeepers were instructed not to
throw out drunkards but keep keep them drinking for the sake of the
revenues. This caused a rift with the church, and general cynicism in
society. It deepened poverty and created a drunken posadskaya golytba, or
urban poor.
Finally, the church, having lost its production monopoly early in the piece,
was forbidden to distil vodka in the 18th century and the right passed to
the gentry (who, in tsarist society, were aristocratic 'serfs' of the
ruler). This added further substance to the church's negative attitude to
what it regarded as the Devil's poison.
Vodka was not called that universally until the 19th century when it went
into full-scale industrial production: earlier, it was known widely as
Russkoye vino (Russian wine). The name arose when producers, who conducted
the process by which a grain distillate was diluted constantly with water
(voda), applied the diminutive of that word (vodka) to their product. It
quickly became general.
Pokhlebkin records how the gentry, with time hanging heavy on their famously
underemployed hands, introduced purifying processes for the water
'regardless of cost.' In the industrial period, other refinements were made,
such as introducing aerated water. 'All of this contributed to the creation
of modern vodkas: that is, of a vodka which is not simply a means of getting
drunk but a complex national product embodying the historical and
technological imagination of the Russian people.' The gentry, getting grain
and labour more or less free from their vast estates and able to tolerate
yields of less than 2 per cent, were able to pursue ways of making vodka as
pure as possible - a process accelerated when the state banned the general
trade in it and all production had to be for the gentry only.
This cosy arrangement was disrupted by 19th century capitalism which,
Pokhlebkin says, 'was disastrous for the common people.' They were deluged
with cheaper-to-make potato and beet vodka, 'leading to the most
unrestrained drunkenness.' To raise quality again, the state was forced to
intervene and establish a monopoly at the end of the 19th century.
Pokhlebkin writes: 'This policy of strict state control was continued and
applied consistently after the revolution of October 1917 (and) has saved
vodka as a product prepared to a high standard from deteriorating.'
Evidently, Pokhlebkin does not think it worth considering that another
method is used in capitalist countries to safeguard the quality of their
(inferior, in his view) spirits - excise controls on private production. For
him, as for so many Russians, there is nothing between the strong state and
chaos. 'A monopoly on vodka has always been a distinguishing feature of
strong stable regimes and tranquillity within the state,' he writes. 'As
soon as something disturbs the orderly course of domestic politics, the
state loses control of vodka. And as soon as vodka is torn from control of
the state, all conceivable disorders break out in domestic politics. Vodka
clearly constitutes an effective index of the state of health and society.'
In a resounding climax, he casts aside the skimpy robes of the 'objective
scientist' for the battledress of the class warrior. The true Russian drink
found its ideal state from 1917 until 1937: it was, after 1923, produced but
kept within rational limits by a (Communist) party morality and by severe
laws against drunkenness. Only after 1937, when the production of alcohol of
all kinds was expanded, did the rot begin to set in - initially among the
'so-called creative intelligentsia . . . and their hangers-on.'
What happened was, according to Pokhlebkin, a kind of sub-Stalinist plot in
which vodka played its role in the hands of the dictator's henchmen to help
finish off the true Leninists. 'They (the henchmen) sought to undermine the
puritan spirit and ideology of the Leninist old guard and of the mass of
party members, and to divert the Bohemian passions of the intelligentsia
into safe channels. With the help of alcohol, they sought to cripple the
tongues of potential critics . . .'
Still more alarmingly, 100 grams of vodka a day was issued to Red Army
soldiers on demand. This state approval eroded the moral stance of the
Bolsheviks, who clung to sobriety as part of what was 'essential to being
regarded as a true communist.'
After Stalin's death vodka prices were kept low and it was widely available
in state shops. Heavy drinking spread from the intelligentsia to the working
class. The state erred deeply, says Pokhlebkin, in leaving workers
increasingly to their own devices (political education was cut back in the
1960s and 1970s) and, at the same time, raising wages.
'During the 1970s,' Pokhlebkin writes, 'the Soviet working class underwent a
general transition to a new mentality in which there was no place for
moralistic condemnations of drunkenness. Thanks to the passing of new and
less draconian laws, people had come to perceive the abuse of alcohol not as
a social but as a personal matter. It was no longer possible to evoke a
popular contempt for drunkards.'
Yet, even a state straying grievously from Leninist ways could not remain
indifferent to the vast losses of production resulting from a large degree
of open and generally unpunished drunkenness at work. (Since Soviet society
had made no distinction between controls at work and outside of it, people
naturally make little distinction between work and non-work behaviour.) Yuri
Andropov, the former KGB chief who, briefly, succeeded the lax (and
heavy-drinking) Leonid Brezhnev as Soviet leader, took the KGB route:
harassing drunks. Mikhail Gorbachev, the idealistic back-to-Leninism leader
(in his first manifestation), copied Lenin's tactic: he banned it.
This excites Pokhlebkin's passionate denunciation, much of it justified. 'In
the course of the anti-alcohol campaign, wine-producing state and collective
farms were dissolved, thousands of hectares of vines were uprooted, wineries
were shut down or assigned to other tasks, and the equipment of vodka
distilleries was dismantled. All these measures were undertaken in the
spirit of the dawn of industrial capitalism in Britain when illiterate and
impoverished Luddites smashed the machines in the factories, thinking that
it was the machines that were stealing their bread and putting them out of
work.'
Pokhlebkin's strange book ends with an insistence that the
generally-perceived way in which Russians consume vodka - knocking it back
in large quantities - is a vulgarisation practised largely by mafiosi or
nouveaux riches 'who know nothing and understand nothing of Russian national
culture.' He says vodka should be drunk (and indeed it should) with the
salty, spicy zakuski, or tasters, which precede a Russian meal.
It was, says Pokhlebkin the Bolshevik, 'during the years when domestic
distilling by the gentry flourished . . . and in the high, aristocratic
milieu that the proper way of drinking vodka at the table came to be
defined. Vodka should be served cold, almost frozen, and drunk in small,
barely-perceptible mouthfuls.'
Apart from this valuable insight, Pokhlebkin's researches helped the Soviets
win their case against the Poles in 1982, and to secure the right to
advertise their product as vodka. 'Thus,' he notes, 'an attempt by certain
foreign circles to harm Soviet commercial interests . . .ended in failure.'
They are still drinking to that, from Gdansk to Vladivostok.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Barclays board loses confidence of some institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUMBER of Barclays Bank's big institutional shareholders said yesterday
they planned to tell the board that they were losing confidence in its top
management.
Institutional shareholders contacted by the Financial Times, which hold
roughly 15 per cent of the bank's shares, expressed varying degrees of
discontent following the news of Barclays' Pounds 242m pre-tax loss and the
halving of its final dividend.
Their comments ranged from the view that Mr Andrew Buxton, Barclays'
chairman and chief executive, should resign, to a desire for board changes.
Mr Buxton said after Thursday's announcement of the loss that investors had
expressed their support for the bank's directors, and their business
strategy.
A number of institutions said they would urge the board to appoint a new
chief executive from outside Barclays - a move they believed it would
resist. The bank has said it will take steps to split the roles of chairman
and chief executive.
Barclays' share price rose yesterday after a near 10 per cent fall on
Thursday. Most securities analysts are forecasting a recovery in Barclays'
fortunes.
Despite doubts about the bank's management, some institutional shareholders
said profits were likely to improve following a pick-up in the economy,
declining interest rates and greater internal lending controls. Several said
they had bought more Barclays shares as prices fell after the earnings
announcement.
Others, accounting for about 6 per cent of the bank's shares, said they
intended to tell management not only that Mr Buxton should cease to hold one
of his two posts but also that he should leave the board entirely.
'I think it is in the interests of shareholders to get a new chairman and a
new chief executive. One of the problems with Barclays is that it has had a
power vacuum at the top,' said one shareholder.
The board's appointment of Mr Buxton as both chairman and chief executive
this January despite reservations among some shareholders was criticised.
Shareholders also pointed to the concentration of losses in the construction
and property sectors as evidence that the bank had not exercised prudent
judgment in allowing itself to become highly exposed to a single sector of
the economy. They said they would seek details of the steps taken to tighten

<TEXT>
THE IRISH government yesterday made conciliatory overtures to the Protestant
majority in Northern Ireland, saying the republic's constitutional claim to
the province was not 'cast in bronze, incapable of change'.
Mr Dick Spring, foreign affairs minister, urged Unionist parties to return
to the negotiating table. 'I want to see an accommodation on the
constitutional issue which is reasonable and fair to all,' he said.
The reaction in Whitehall was cautiously upbeat. Sir Patrick Mayhew,
Northern Ireland secretary, hopes the new Irish government will help end the
political deadlock in the province. But Mr Spring's overtures were given a
chilly response by Unionist leaders, suggesting any breakthrough remains
elusive.
Nonetheless, it is the most affirmative statement yet by the Irish
government that it is willing to embark on some sort of compromise with
Northern Ireland's Unionist majority.
It was the first keynote speech by Mr Spring, the Labour party leader, on
the Northern Ireland issue since he took office in January as part of the
new coalition. Mr Spring would appear to be asserting the stamp of his
party, which has one third of the seats in the cabinet, on the country's
foreign policy.
All-party talks on Northern Ireland, embracing the UK and Irish governments
and the four main constitutional parties in Northern Ireland, broke down
last November. The Unionists insist the republic must drop its territorial
claim to the north if progress is to be made.
Mr Spring said yesterday that his government was committed to the principle,
laid out in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, that there would be no change in
the status of Northern Ireland without the consent of the majority there.
'We will be quite ready to confirm and elaborate that principle in various
ways as Unionists might wish, in any new agreement that transcends the
Anglo-Irish Agreement,' he said, adding that the constitution was never
intended to be an obstacle to mutual understanding.
Mr Spring said: 'We clearly see the need to get around the table to work out
how a generally acceptable package might fairly accommodate the deep
divisions, including the divisions on constitutional issues, which are the
source of the conflict.' He also proposed a new agreement or covenant.
Mr Spring hinted that he might be prepared to travel to Belfast to restart
bilateral negotiations with the Unionists, and added: 'We must at some time
reach the point where all of us around a table can say to each other: this
is a very difficult for us, but it is a just and fair compromise.'
Mr Peter Robinson, deputy leader of the Democratic Unionist Party in
Northern Ireland, responded negatively, to the offer, saying: 'Between my
door and his door there is a road which has a very large obstacle placed on
it, which he alone and his country can remove - that must be the priority.
'He has to face up to the reality that you cannot have a new relationship
until the Irish Republic removes its claim to our territory.'

FT  06 MAR 93 / Russian parliament set to challenge Yeltsin: Showdown will
threaten reform programme
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN parliament yesterday set the stage for a showdown with President
Boris Yeltsin over who holds power in Russia in a move which threatens his
reform programme.
The parliament rejected Mr Yeltsin's proposals for a power-sharing deal and
voted to summon an emergency session of Russia's supreme legislature, the
Congress of People's Deputies, next Wednesday, to debate the constitutional
crisis.
The move came amid signs that the congress, which meets only occasionally,
would also seek to cancel a referendum on power-sharing, to which it agreed
in December.
If the congress blocked both options for Mr Yeltsin to cut the bloated
legislature inherited from Soviet days - either through constitutional
change or by referendum - Mr Yeltsin would have little choice but to call a
personal plebiscite seeking the support of the Russian people.
Such a move, without the backing of the congress, would carry little weight
constitutionally. However, Mr Yeltsin has suggested that it would at least
show who the people support. He has even hinted that he would consider
emergency powers if a power-sharing deal did not follow from the plebiscite.
The president's lawyers already appear to be preparing the way for him to
hold the plebiscite: they warned deputies that they would lose their legal
right to any say over the referendum if they reneged on their December vote
to hold one in the first place.
Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, first deputy prime minister, told deputies earlier
that Mr Yeltsin's proposals for a truce over power-sharing were not final:
the issue was whether they wanted an agreement at all. The answer from
parliament was no.
Mr Shumeiko also told the parliament that Mr Yeltsin wanted the referendum
to ask three questions, which touch on the main issues of the day:
Should there be private ownership of land?
Should a new constitution be adopted by a constituent assembly (as opposed
to the existing congress)?
Should the highest branch of legislative power be a two-chamber legislative
assembly?
But, with some regions threatening not to stage a referendum at all, Mr
Yeltsin knows that a vote would be a high-risk gamble. However, he has
virtually no alternative, pending an 11th-hour Russian compromise, to save
the reforms and his credibility.
Apart from asking the parliament to stick to legislative functions, Mr
Yeltsin has proposed that the central bank and the state statistics
committee be transferred from parliamentary to government control.
He also wants an end to tinkering with the existing Soviet-era constitution
until a constituent assembly approves a new constitution. In the meantime he
is seeking the suspension of Article 104 under which congress is 'the
supreme organ of state power'.
Mr Yeltsin also wants to abolish the system of state property funds, which
answer to the legislative branch and are supposed to share the task of
privatisation with the government's privatisation committees.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rebound in US employment during February seems to confirm the evidence
of a widespread and strong recovery. Recent purchasing managers surveys and
sharp growth in the last quarter of 1992 point in the same direction. But
care is needed in interpreting the figures. A large number of the new jobs
were part-time and concentrated in the retail and construction sectors,
while manufacturing jobs showed only a slight increase. And given that
employment growth was unexpectedly weak at the end of 1992, the seasonal
adjustment of the figures may be faulty.
Consumer confidence has also been falling, which is hardly consistent with
rapidly improving employment prospects. That decline has accelerated since
President Clinton unveiled his deficit reduction plans. Individuals may
already be retrenching in the expectation of tax increases, while the
beneficiaries of his fiscal stimulus have not yet been clearly identified.
Modest growth concentrated on construction, with productivity improvements
providing most of the boost in manufacturing, may reassure the bond market.
Long yields around 6.75 per cent would thus prove sustainable. If growth
falters, they may even fall further. But equities will struggle harder.
Prices have marked time for two years on the expectation of recovery.
Ratings have fallen as earnings have recovered. On estimated 1993 and 1994
profits Wall Street does not look expensive, but neither is it a steal. With
sustained growth elusive, there may be more waiting to come.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
UK bank shares have risen by over 50 per cent since sterling left the ERM
last September. Until the current results season, the rise seemed justified
on the basis that lower interest rates would gradually float the sector free
of bad debt provisions. The optimism now seems overdone. Though Barclays was
the worst performer, there was a general trend for bad debts to rise between
the first and second halves of 1992. They may be stubbornly slow to fall in
1993. There will be less topping up of old property provisions, but economic
recovery tends to stretch small businesses and provisions on European
lending look set to rise.
Nor is the outlook for operating profits encouraging. Though 1992 produced
increases of 20 per cent and 18 per cent at National Westminster and
Barclays respectively, Lloyds and Midland, which are further down the
cost-cutting road, saw hardly any increase at all. Loan demand is flat and
there is limited scope for repeating the money market profits generated from
the steep fall in interest rates last autumn.
Those who fear more nasty surprises on provisions might be attracted by a
defensive stock like Lloyds. It can virtually guarantee real dividend
increases, but may not manage sufficient growth in operating income to
justify its present price. Arguably Barclays is on the least demanding
rating in terms of operating profits. Yet those who buy today may have to
wait till 1995 or 1996 before provisions return to more normal levels.

FT  06 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Cookson
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Cookson's management should resolve never to place the company at the mercy
of another put option. The obligation to buy out its partner in the Stern
Leach precious metals business cost an unwelcome Pounds 50m last year.
Another Pounds 80m will have to be found next year to repay convertible bond
holders certain to demand their money back early. Since working capital is
also being squeezed by the early stages of US recovery, Cookson faced a
pressing requirement for additional capital to which yesterday's rights
issue was a natural answer.
Gearing climbed from 51 per cent to 74 per cent last year, and would have
been higher but for the effect of weaker sterling on shareholders' funds. As
well as bringing gearing to a more comfortable level, there will be cash
left over for acquisitions. In the light of history, it is tempting to
conclude shareholders are being asked to give the company enough rope to
hang itself. But after two years' consolidation under new management and
with the cycle turning in its favour, Cookson may deserve some leeway.
It has to do something. There is little chance of squeezing much more than
Pounds 1.5bn turnover from its slimmed-down set of businesses. Even if it
reaches a target return on sales of 10 per cent - and allowing for a modest
interest charge - that might imply pre-tax profits of perhaps Pounds 140m at
the peak, possibly three years away on an optimistic view. On that basis,
the shares were starting to look fully valued before yesterday's
announcement.

It is a sign of the times that the London market still wants to go up
despite the bad news from Barclays. The most obvious reason is the
accommodating stance taken by the Bundesbank. That not only raises the
prospect that the UK will also soon be able to cut interest rates again. A
stronger pound, coupled with the realisation that the UK could have the
strongest economic performance in Europe this year, is pulling foreign
buyers into British equities. Still, there are risks in these assumptions.
The market seems to have brushed aside earlier worries on dividend growth.
Barclays cut its payout this week. Results next week from the likes of
Rolls-Royce and Willis Corroon may show it is not alone. Cookson
demonstrated yesterday that the flow of rights issues is not necessarily
over. The market's present level could look stretched if, as has often
happened in the past, London is jumping to conclusions about the Bundesbank.
Yesterday's quarter point cut in German money market rates makes a cut in
the official rates almost inevitable. But the Bundesbank has also indicated
that it will move cautiously, not least because of its fear that the D-Mark
will weaken too much against the dollar. It may now be cutting the salami in
thicker slices, but it is not yet disposed to hack it off in chunks.
That puts Mr Norman Lamont in a quandary. The next Bundesbank council
meeting is on March 18, two days after the Budget. If he is planning to
sweeten any tax increases with a further rate cut, he will have to take a
risk on matching action from the Bundesbank. Otherwise sterling would again
look uncomfortably exposed.

FT  06 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow flat despite unemployment
figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
A DAY of fluctuating price movements ended with US stock shares flat or
lower in spite of a stronger than expected February employment report,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.67 at 3,404.58. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 finished down 1.16 at 446.18, while
the Amex composite ended up 0.96 at 413.80, and the Nasdaq composite 0.64
higher at 681.37. Trading volume on the NYSE was 249m shares.
The news that non-farm payrolls had jumped 365,000 and the national
unemployment rate dropped from 7.1 per cent to 7.0 per cent last month
surprised Wall Street, which had been expecting only a modest increase in
payrolls and no change in the jobless rate.
The markets, however, failed to respond positively to the news, at least at
first. Prices fell in early trading, and remained essentially flat for most
of the morning session. The weakness in equities was attributed to the big
fall in bond prices which followed the release of the jobs data.
The benchmark 30-year bond issue initially fell by more than a point on the
news, sending the yield back above 6.8 per cent. The rise in bond yields
upset equity investors, who fear higher interest rates could slow economic
growth. Bonds, however, rallied later to end virtually unchanged, the
30-year yielding 6.74 per cent.
This recovery helped shares bounce back strongly, with the Dow showing a
gain of 35 points at one stage, but the buying quickly petered out and
leading issues were fortunate to hold on to their gains.
Among individual stocks, some cyclicals and big industrial issues were in
good form. Alcoa climbed Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 69 7/8 , Goodyear firmed
Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 71 1/8 , General Electric put on Dollars  3/4 at
Dollars 85 3/4 , and Caterpillar added Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 58 3/4 .
Computer shares were also in demand. Motorola was especially strong, rising
almost Dollars 3 before slipping back to end up Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 60
1/4 in turnover of 1.3m shares. Hewlett-Packard added Dollars  7/8 at
Dollars 76 3/4 , and Digital Equipment climbed Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 46 3/4
.
Salomon, which fell sharply on Thursday on news of trading losses at its
Wall Street securities subsidiary, bounced back, rising Dollars 3/4 to
Dollars 40 3/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, many leading issues were lower. After a strong start,
Microsoft fell back to end Dollars 1 lower at Dollars 82 3/4 , Intel lost
Dollars 2 7/8 at Dollars 115 3/4 , and Amgen slipped Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 33 1/4 .
Canada
TORONTO shares ended the week on a winning note, closing higher in continued
active trading. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index rose 23.20
points, or 0.66 per cent, to 3,524.49, for a gain on the week of about 72
points.
Advances led declines 383 to 281. Volume soared to 72.245m shares from
68,576,000 shares on Thursday, and trading value was CDollars 707.2m against
CDollars 630.1m.

STRONG buying interest in Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gave some support

The 225-issue Nikkei average added 58.09 to 16,817.70 after a day's high of
16,746.12 and a low of 16,885.12, slightly down on the week.
Volume was estimated at 270m shares, up from 244.5m on Thursday, with

The Topix index of all first section stocks advanced 2.20 to 1,268.31.

NTT resumed its recent rally, climbing Y39,000 to Y705,000 in heavy volume

PACIFIC Rim markets found widely mixed fortunes.
HONG KONG remained in record territory as the market gave a guarded welcome

The Hang Seng index rose 35.01 to a second consecutive all-time high close
of 6,502.81, for a weekly rise of 2.3 per cent. Turnover remained heavy at
HKDollars 4.7bn with continued strong demand seen from domestic, US and
Chinese investors.
Shares dipped shortly after the opening as profit-taking took the index down
almost 40 points, but confidence re-emerged before Mr Patten addressed the
Legislative Council.
'In the event, the speech was neutral to positive, fully justifying the
rally we have seen so far,' said one analyst.
HSBC Holdings, which will report earnings mid-month, led the actives and
rose HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 68. Its Hang Seng Bank unit, which posted a 26
per cent rise in profits, added HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 67.
AUSTRALIA continued lower, under pressure from weak News Corp shares and
uncertainty in the run-up to the election. The All Ordinaries index closed
9.3 points down at 1,613.6, little changed on the week.
News Corp, which said its options issue raised Dollars 507 million, fell 15
cents to ADollars 7.15 as 8.2m shares changed hands. Brokers explained that
the 5.5 per cent yield on News America Holdings' liquid yield option notes

TAIWAN turned back after its strong run earlier in the week and the weighted

SEOUL recorded a new low for the year after falling for the eighth

FT  06 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: US markets struggle to understand
Clinton - Investors are confused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although it has been more than two weeks since President Bill Clinton
formally unveiled his bold tax-raising and deficit-cutting budget, US stock
markets remain confused about what the plan means for the economy, corporate
earnings and share prices.
When the new president presented his economic plan in mid-February, the
markets wasted no time in expressing displeasure at the scale of the tax
increases and the timidity of the spending cuts, and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average fell by almost 100 points.
Yet, in the next week and a half, the Dow recovered all of its lost ground,
so that the index now stands at almost exactly where it was before the
Clinton budget was unveiled.
At first glance, it may look as though the markets have been unusually
indecisive and slow off the mark: normally, Wall Street takes only a short
time to digest economic and political news and spit out a judgment. Yet,
there are some good reasons why the markets have struggled to come to terms
with 'Clintonomics'.
To begin with, the scope and ambition of the president's plan has been more
than a mouthful for dealers and investors. Among his proposals are tax
increases on middle and top income earners, on corporations and on energy
use; tax breaks on investment and tax cuts for the working poor; an
assortment of spending increases on infrastructure projects, education,
science and technology and certain social programmes; and selected spending
cuts.
Working out how these measures will affect the economy is not easy. The
simpler certainties of the Reagan era and the policy inertia of the Bush
years have been replaced by activist, reforming, big government. The markets
will take time getting used to the changed political, economic and policy
landscape.
To make matters worse, not only has the White House hinted that the Clinton
economic blueprint may be amended, updated or expanded before it reaches the
legislators, but anyone with a basic understanding of how Washington works
knows that there is no chance that the budget will make it through Congress
in one piece. Hence it makes sense for the markets to be wary of passing
judgement on a radical new economic policy until it does become policy.
Secondly, the introduction of the budget and the first weeks of its life
have been played out against a background of economic 'noise' that has been
distinctly discordant. The statistics released and surveys published since
the State of the Union address on February 18 have painted an inconsistent
picture of the nation's economic health.
If anything, the message in the figures, which have included sharp declines
in home sales and consumer confidence, weak factory orders, and inconsistent
growth in labour markets, has been that economic recovery may have slowed
after the post-election spurt of growth seen in the fourth quarter of 1992.
This has only added to the confusion. The markets would love to come up with
a conclusive answer as to what the budget means for the economy; but it is
difficult when they no longer know where the economy stands.
Finally, equity investors have been unsettled by the extraordinary recent
rally in the Treasury bond markets, where prices have risen sharply on
growing confidence that the president's policies will simultaneously slow
economic growth, dampen inflationary pressures, and reduce the deficit.
Since Mr Clinton won the election on November 3, the yield on the benchmark
30-year government bond has fallen from 7.65 per cent to 6.72 per cent, and
on the two-year note from 4.42 per cent to 3.72 per cent. The 30-year bond
is now recording the lowest yield since the issue was first sold to the
public in 1977.
Given that Democratic presidents are generally regarded as the enemy of
fixed-income investors because of their tendency to use government spending
to generate economic growth (a policy approach roundly criticised by
free-marketeers for its inflationary consequences), the performance of the
bond market under Mr Clinton has been nothing short of remarkable.
Which is why the equity markets do not know quite what to make of it all.
Traditionally, stocks can get a lift from a bond market rally because lower
interest rates are good news for corporate and individual borrowers, and for
the economy. So dramatic has the decline in bond yields been, however, that
there is a worry that the booming government securities market will lure
investors' funds away from the struggling equities markets.
It is difficult to ascertain how long the confusion and uncertainty will
last - the political road ahead for the budget is long and strewn with
obstacles. As for fundamentals, the good news is that interest rates are low
and corporate earnings are improving; but the bad news is that price
valuations are high and the economy may be cooling off. The indication is
that US stock markets, over the short-term at least, will remain on a
faltering course.

FT  06 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Buba rate cut catches bourses
by surprise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cut by the Bundesbank of the repo rate caught markets by surprise as it
seemed to signal an imminent cut in the Lombard and discount rates, perhaps
at the next council meeting on March 18, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT moved modestly down as some analysts forecast a period of
consolid-ation for the market following recent strength. The DAX index
closed 4.58 lower at 1,682.82, up 1.4 per cent on the week, as turnover rose
slightly to DM6.5bn from DM6.3bn.
With 'Bundesbank watching' entering a new phase as some observers try to
second-guess when the Lombard and discount rates will actually be cut, other
observers continue to warn that the fundamentals of the German economy
remain weak and are expected to weaken throughout 1993. On this basis, they
say, the present market valuation looks rather stretched and vulnerable to a
downward correction.
One analyst in London commented that many investors still have not fully
appreciated that 1993 earnings are likely to be further downgraded, given
the recent batch of disappointing economic data.
This will be underlined when chemicals report next week. Mr Patrick Shields
of NatWest Securities forecasts a decline in 1992 pre-tax earnings of 47 per
cent for Basf, 26 per cent for Hoechst and 15 per cent for Bayer, which
yesterday announced short-time working at some of its plants. The shares
fell respectively DM2.60, DM2.40 and DM1.20 to DM227.00, DM254.40 and
DM272.30.
PARIS was firm in early trading, weakened later before sprinting to a gain
in the CAC-40 index of 8.37 to 1,995.12, for a week's rise of 2.6 per cent.
Turnover remained firm at FFr3.8bn.
Speculation on possible stake building continued to lift volume in Suez,
which saw 1.6m shares change hands as the shares gained FFr13.20 to
FFr318.20. Of all the names rumoured to be interested in the group,
including that of Sir James Goldsmith, only UAP, which currently has a 6.5
per cent stake, denied interest. UAP finished FFr11 stronger at FFr586.
The car sector finished a dreadful week with further losses in Peugeot, down
FFr18 at FFr572, Michelin, off FFr4.60 at FFr175.10 and Valeo FFr34 lower at
FFr751.
AMSTERDAM ended a difficult week higher, with the CBS Tendency index up 0.8
at 101.8, up 1.9 per cent on the week. There was lingering interest in
companies which had reported this week with Philips and DSM both 30 cents
higher at Fl 22.80 and Fl 73.50 and Polygram up 50 cents at Fl 49.40.
Heineken set a new record high, up Fl 8.30 or Fl 195.80, but some analysts
felt that the shares were now beginning to look expensive.
MILAN marked time although the market was alive with rumours which made for
an active day's trading. The Comit index eased 1.25 to 535.47 - 4.3 per cent
ahead on the week.
Olivetti fixed L63 or 2.6 per cent lower at L2,385 before easing to L2,365
after hours and Sip was L26 lower at L1,680 amid fears that the groups might
be planning rights issues.
Stet shed L35 to L2,355 before easing to L2,340 after hours on speculation
that it might soon conclude the sale of a stake in its telecommunications
equipment subsidiary Italtel.
In the other direction, Rinascente, L480 or 5.5 per cent ahead at L9,190,
was in demand, particularly by US investors in spite of Fiat's fresh denials
that its sale was being negotiated.
Pirelli broke through the L1,500 level, adding L50 to L1,531 in heavy
volume.
Stocks from the Ligresti group were caught up in speculation about possible
divestments. Holding company Premafin shot up L621 or 12.8 per cent to
L5,450 and were up to L5,650 after hours, while Grassetto, the construction
group, rose L660 or 12.2 per cent to fix at L6,060 before continuing up to
L6,175 after hours.
Elsewhere, the Consob market regulatory agency suspended the shares of
holding company Fimpar and its hotel group Ciga pending an announcement on
the status of Ciga's financial restructuring plan.
ZURICH finished easier but a strengthening dollar enabled shares to pull up
from the day's lows. The SMI index dipped 4.9 to 2,134.6, a 1.6 per cent
rise on the week.
CS Holding fell SFr30 to SFr2,230 after its main asset, Credit Suisse,
reported a 1.1 per cent rise in 1992 group net profit which was at the lower
end of expectations. UBS, which last week reported a 10.4 per cent rise in
net income, rose SFr2 to SFr944.
BBC Brown Boveri shed SFr50 to SFr3,940. Analysts expect the Zurich-based
Asea Brown Boveri, from which BBC derives virtually all its income, to
announce 1992 profit at or below the previous year's level.
STOCKHOLM drew strength from lower debt market yields and better than
expected earnings from Sandvik. The Affarsvarlden Index rose 16.7 to 1,031.2
, a 3.1 per cent rise on the week.
Sandvik's B shares rose SKr12 to SKr465 as the company unexpectedly raised
its dividend and a fall in profits proved not as bad as feared.

FT  06 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Income funds buy utilities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'Barclays' factor continued to influence the market yesterday, with many
of the City's biggest income funds severely shaken by Barclays' decision to
halve the final dividend.
These funds were said to have focused their interest yesterday on utilities,
which are perceived by fund managers as providing safe earnings and a strong
dividend return whatever the economic conditions. The prospect of
Europe-wide reductions in interest rates gave further impetus to the
sectors.
Water stocks performed exceptionally well, with dealers citing the
unravelling of some heavy programme trade business late on Thursday, as
driving share prices higher. The biggest business in the waters was seen in
the Footsie-100 stocks where Anglian closed 6 up at 528p, North West Water 3
1/2 better at 513p and Thames which settled 6 1/2 to the good at 531p.
The generators moved sharply higher in heavy turnover, despite their recent
strong outperformance of the rest of the utilities stocks, with National
Power settling 8 higher at 326p and PowerGen the same amount better at 330p.
Scottish Hydro shrugged aside worries that the company may be ejected from
the Footsie 100 following the forthcoming March 9 meeting of the steering
committee and edged up 3 to 256p. The 70p call on the Scottish generators
shares is due on April 6.
Southern Electric, viewed by some as another prime candidate to drop out of
the Footsie-100, closed 9 up at 479p.

<TEXT>
Confirmation of a rights issue from industrial materials company Cookson
Group nevertheless surprised many market watchers and sent the shares into
retreat on an otherwise strong day in the market.
The company, which also announced figures in line with market expectations,
is to make a one-for-four rights issue at 170p a share to raise Pounds
185.6m to fund growth and reduce acquisitions. This is the second time
within the last two years that the company has called on the market for
cash.
The shares gave up 13 to 199p and Mr Andrew Mitchell at Smith New Court
said: 'The shares are unlikely to go anywhere until the potential disposals
and acquisitions are seen.'

<TEXT>
LONDON's enthusiastic reception for the easing in repurchase rates in
Germany was fully reflected in the derivates markets yesterday, writes Terry
Byland. The March contract on the FT-SE Index continued to show its strong
premium against the cash market. Trading volume was reduced somewhat, but
the market stood up well to a bout of selling by one source.
News of the Bundesbank's move came soon after the opening of the stock index
future, and the March contract quickly soared to a day's high of 2,938,
holding a 13 point premium against the underlying Footsie. The seller then
drove the contract all the way down to 2,908 but the 2,900 mark was safely
held. The final official quotation of 2,931 showed the contract at a premium
of around 9 points to cash, with the fair value calculation at a four point
discount.
Dealers reported renewed activity on the spread now showing between March
and the June contract. Of total volume of around 8,400 contracts some 1,500
deals reflected intra-contract spread trading.

FT  06 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A reassessment of Barclays' shock move to halve the final dividend after
absorbing its first ever preliminary loss, a move which triggered a plunge
in the bank's shares, led to a gradual rehabilitation of the stock price.
Despite a general wave of downward adjustments of current year estimates -
BZW lowered their current year expectation from Pounds 375m to Pounds 300m,
County moved down from Pounds 525m to Pounds 500m and Nikko reduced to
Pounds 415m - the market responded to a flurry of short covering and buying
on recovery hopes.
The rally in Barclays drove the shares up 16 to 408p with turnover in the
stock totalling a hefty 16m shares. NatWest, whose tier one capital ratio of
5.2 per cent was highlighted by analysts who pointed to the more secure 5.5
per cent provided by Barclays, suffered at the expense of Barclays shares,
closing 7 off at 437p.
Other banks shares mirrored the overall strength of the market with Standard
Chartered extending its recent outstanding market performance and closing a
further 6 up at 708p in front of Wednesday's preliminary results which are
now expected to come in above market expectations.
TSB attracted a fresh wave of takeover speculation which saw the shares race
up 8 to a new all-time peak of 183p.
Union Discount shares plunged 19 to 84p after takeover talks between the
discount house and an unnamed party were terminated. But the group said it
had received an offer for Winterflood Securities, its successful specialist
marketmaking subsidiary run by Mr Brian Winterflood.
The revelation of a strong profits increase by Barclays' securities arm,
BZW, plus the recent excellent figures announced by Kleinwort Benson, saw a
surge of interest in the merchant banks. Hambros jumped 10 to 328p, SG
Warburg put on 3 to 634p and Kleinwort Benson settled 4 up at 393p.
Food retailers shrugged off recent worries of an imposition of VAT in the UK
budget later this month. J Sainsbury gained 11 to 534p and Tesco firmed 4 to
249p. Argyll Group added 13 to 381p, boosted by a recommendation from BZW.
Mr Bill Currie at the securities house said: 'Trading is good especially in
the new stores and there are significant productivity benefits to come over
the next few years.'
NatWest Securities was the day's main buyer of Kingfisher and the shares
moved 13 ahead to 542p. The house said Thursday's falls had been overdone.
Vague talk that Argos was planning to dispose of its home furnishings
division was heard though it was quickly dismissed by analysts. The shares
were however strong and closed 10 better at 290p, with BZw said to be
positive on the stock.
Shares in Airtours gained 13 to 327 1/2 p, with dealers predicting success
in its bid for rival Owners Abroad, 6 better at 144p.
The latest sharp rise in oil prices - Brent crude jumped around 50 cents to
Dollars 19.70 a barrel - kept the oil sector on the move. The exploration
and production stocks were strongly supported, reflecting the recent push to
the sub-sector given by SG Warburg and the hike in oil prices. Enterprise
closed 10 up at 488p. Hopes of imminent asset disposals continued to drive
Lasmo, 3 firmer at 185p. Aran's strong acreage position west of the
Shetlands oil discovery made by BP and Shell triggered keen interest in Aran
shares which rose 2 to 27 1/2 p.
A combination of factors sent British Aerospace into retreat. Profit-taking,
combined with concerns that the company will have to repay around Pounds 60m
it received from the UK government in 'sweeteners', and lower than expected
sales from its Rover cars subsidiary, left the shares 7 lighter at 276p. TI
Group closed 10 up at 305p in heavy trading of 9.1m shares. Worries about
the poor outlook for the automotive sector in Germany weakened Laird Group,
and the shares eased 6 to 269p. A rise in UK new car registrations for
February boosted motor dealers. Thomas Cowie, which reported figures this
week, jumped 10 to 216p.
Whispers that Tadpole Technology will soon announce a significant deal sent
the shares sharply ahead, jumping 27 to 324p.

FT  06 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Rate cut hopes return to boost shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON stock market had no hesitation in assessing the implications of
the Bundesbank's move to reduce repurchase rates yesterday; 'this points the
way to a rate cut in the UK', was the view expressed by London market
strategists. The stock market took the hint and closed last night at a new
all-time high of 2,922.1 on the FT-SE Index.
Caught out by the timing of the move in Germany, UK shares rose sharply
following the news to touch a new trading high of 2,925 on the Footsie
scale. This initial gain was then swiftly eroded as a Pounds 200m plus
trading programme switched attention to the non-Footsie stocks and traders
in the blue chips shied away ahead of the announcement of economic data from
on the US.
But a favourable response on Wall Street to strong US employment figures put
12 points on the Dow in early trading and helped set London back on the
upward track. At the close, the FT-SE Index showed a net gain of 17.3
points.
The buy programme in non-Footsie stocks revealed itself when Seaq volume
jumped nearly threefold at mid-morning. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index had another
strong session, gaining 20 points to a new peak of 3,107.9. Trading in
non-Footsie stocks jumped to around 68 per cent of the day's Seaq total of
860.1m shares. The total included nearly 200m shares involved in two
specific deals in investment group Rutland Trust. On Thursday, non-Footsie
business made up about 57 per cent of Seaq volume of 660.3m shares, which
was worth Pounds 1.43bn at retail level.
London investors are now focusing on Budget week in the UK. Budget day, on
Tuesday March 16, will be followed two days later by the meeting of the
Bundesbank policy council and then, on the Friday by the latest UK Retail
Price Index. Strategists see this as a likely timetable for a cut of at
least half a point in UK base rates.
Yesterday's move by the Bundesbank was seen as a clear step towards a cut of
perhaps half a point in the Lombard rate, and perhaps of a  1/4 in the
discount rate, shortly.
The FT-SE Index has risen by nearly 2 per cent this week and is expected to
extend its gain into the second week of the equity account. Buyers were out
in force yesterday in the interest-related sectors.
The shock delivered on Thursday by Barclays Bank's dividend cut still kept
enthusiasm in check, however.
Long-dated government bonds gained around three quarters of a point as
yields fell back to reflect the likelihood of another move towards lower
interest rates in the UK.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar and sterling soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH the dollar and sterling soared against the D-Mark yesterday after the
Bundesbank announced a cut in money market interest rates on the same day
that the US non-farm payroll figure showed an astonishingly strong rise,
writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank's decision to cut the interest rate on its 14-day repo to
8.25 per cent from the previous 8.49 per cent announcement took financial
markets completely by surprise.
The expectation had been that a change in the central bank's money market
rates would be announced on Thursday afternoon, following the Bundesbank's
last council meeting, or that it would come next Tuesday when details of the
weekly money market intervention are broadcast.
The release of the US non-farm payroll figure, which showed a rise of
365,000 in February, was the second big surprise of the day. The market had,
at best been expecting a rise of 150,000. Around 90 per cent of the rise in
the payroll figure consisted of part-time workers, but this did not stop the
dollar breaking through the critical level of DM1.67 for the first time in
nearly a year.
The dollar later closed at DM1.6670, more than 3 pfennigs up on the day.
Sterling also performed strongly, helped by a statement from the UK Treasury
that cuts in German rates would not necessarily be followed by an easing in
UK policy. The pound closed at DM2.4100, also up more than 3 pfennigs on the
day.
The German central bank said that it had cut the repo rate to deal with the
unusually high interest rates being set for call money in the cash market.
But Mr Brian Hilliard of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull said that it
would have been more normal policy to deal with a short-term liquidity
problem by adding emergency funds, as dictated by paragraph 17 of the
Bundesbank constitution.
Another analyst suggested that the Bundesbank had decided to move in
response to new pressures on the French franc in Thursday night's trading in
the US. But the central bank may have taken its decision to wean the markets
away from expecting policy changes only on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
According to Mr Neil MacKinnon of Citibank, the next crucial test for the
dollar will be to get through the DM1.68 level. He is confident that this
will happen and continued to forecast a level of DM1.80 for the US currency
this year. However, the high percentage of part-time workers in the payroll
may be a freak, forcing dealers to wait for the next monthly employment
figure before pushing the dollar up further.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Futures drop sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
CASH rates in European markets dropped sharply yesterday after the
Bundesbank surprised dealers by announcing a lower rate for securities
repurchase agreements, writes James Blitz.
The Bundesbank said it was cutting the interest rate on the 14-day repo to
8.25 per cent from the previous 8.49 per cent in response to wide swings in
German money market rates. The bank also said it was setting a 28-day tender
for funds at variable interest rates.
Both the Belgian and Dutch central banks said they would be lowering their
money market intervention rates next week in response to the Bundesbank's
move.
The Bundesbank explained the timing of the move by saying that it was
responding to strongly fluctuating money market interest rates, and
difficulties in the market in setting rates on German call money.
Dealers reported call money yesterday morning at rates varying from 8.75 to
8.90 per cent. The Bundesbank's move brought call money sharply down to 8.49
per cent and the level of 3-month D-Marks down to 8.02 per cent.
At the same time, by putting the repo rate only 25 basis points above the
discount rate floor, it rasied expectations of a cut in the officially
posted rates at the next Bundesbank council meeting on March 18.
Euromark futures rose 11 basis points to close at 92.05 in the wake of the
move, predicting that 3-month money in ten days time will be at 7.95 per
cent.
The March French franc contract rose 29 basis points to close at 88.61, and
the June contract closed 57 basis points higher at 91.41. Three month French
francs closed sharply lower at 11 1/2 per cent from 11 per cent at the start
of the day.
Sterling futures also rose sharply on the move, despite another assurance
from UK government officials that a drop in German rates would not
automatically lead to an easing in UK policy. The March contract closed up 7
basis points at 94.04, while the June contract closed up 3 basis points at
94.58. At this level, the June contract assumes that 3-month sterling cash
will be at 5.42 per cent by the summer.
Three month money closed at 5 15/16 per cent yesterday, down  1/8 per cent
on the day. The move was helped by the relatively swift removal of a Pounds
1.75bn shortage by clearing banks and discount houses.

FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: BNP tumbles steeply to FFr2.1bn

<TEXT>
BANQUE Nationale de Paris (BNP), one of France's largest state-controlled
banks, yesterday highlighted the difficulties of the French banking sector
by unveiling an unexpectedly steep fall in estimated net profits, of 28 per
cent, to FFr2.1bn (Dollars 378m) from FFr2.9bn in 1991.
It said its performance last year had been badly affected by the need to
make heavy provisions on its property interests and industrial investments.
The group, with Credit Lyonnais, is a candidate for privatisation if, as
expected, France's conservative coalition wins this month's parliamentary
elections.
Other French banks have also reported poor results for 1992.
The banking sector last year suffered from the impact of the sluggish
economy on demand for credit and from the problems of the property market,
particularly in Paris, and the steep increase in business failures among
small and medium-sized companies.
This week Suez, the industrial group with significant investment banking
interests, disclosed that last year it had suffered its first ever loss.
Societe Generale, a leading commercial bank, recently announced static
profits for 1992. Paribas, the investment banking group, said it had
returned to the black last year but was forced to make steep provisions.
BNP refused to comment on its 1992 performance, saying it would publish
detailed figures after a board meeting at the end of this month.
However it confirmed that net banking income rose by 5.2 per cent to FFr40bn
last year, with costs rising at the slower rate of 3.7 per cent. As a result
it was able to improve its operating margins, with operating profits rising
by 8.9 per cent to FFr11.8bn.
The group, which has already reported a 13.4 per cent fall in interim net
profits to FFr1.33bn for the first half of 1992 after provisions of
FFr4.11bn, did not specify the exact level of provisions for the full year.
Credit Lyonnais is expanding its European interests by raising its stake in
Banque Franco-Hellenique of Greece from 50 per cent to 75 per cent by buying
shares from the Greek National Bank for Industrial Development, which will
retain a 25 per cent stake.

FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rothschild Bank board rebuilding
completed

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROTHSCHILD Bank (RBZ), the Zurich-based private bank that has been under a
cloud since revealing SFr250m (Dollars 165m) in unauthorised loan losses
last year, has completed a rebuilding of its executive board.
The bank announced this week the appointment of Mr Michael Trummer to a new
position of director of operations. Mr Trummer worked for several years at
Bank Julius Baer in Zurich and in New York before joining RBZ.
Last September, Mr Guy Wais, the former general manager of Guyerzeller Bank,
a Zurich private bank owned by the UK's Midland Bank, joined RBZ as its
general manager. Before his appointment, the bank had been without a general
manager for nearly two years.
RBZ said Mr Trummer's position was created specifically to help prevent the
management failures that led to last year's crisis. He would be responsible
for accounting, data processing, securities management and external
payments.
The bank said last September it had discovered irregularities in lending in
the spring. Mr Jurg Heer, its credit manager, was sacked and charged by the
Zurich police with fraud and embezzlement. RBZ said at the time that no one
else was involved.
Mr Heer subsequently claimed he was acting with other people in schemes to
launder and invest mainly Italian clients' funds. He admitted receiving some
SFr30m in commissions as a result of these deals.
The bank's loan losses arose mainly from loans made to companies in the
Lucern-based York Hannover group, which went bankrupt last year. Mr Karsten
von Wersebe, the head of York Hannover, and lawyers associated with the
group have claimed that Mr Heer was not acting alone, but they have not
produced evidence proving that other senior RBZ directors were involved.
RBZ hired Coopers &amp; Lybrand to investigate, and a senior bank official said
this week the investigation backed up the bank's view that Mr Heer had been
acting alone.
The other new member of RBZ's executive board is Mr Urs Meisterhans, a
long-time employee who has replaced Mr Heer as credit manager. Mr Oskar
Campische remains responsible for asset management.

FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Deutsche Bank acquires Spanish
unit for Pta42bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's largest bank, is doubling its share of the Spanish
banking market with the Pta42bn (Dollars 357m) purchase of Banco de Madrid
from Banesto, one of Spain's biggest banking groups.
The move, Deutsche's first significant acquisition outside Germany since Mr
Hilmar Kopper took over as chief executive three years ago, will give the
German bank a 2 per cent share of the Spanish market.
The deal is a major success for the German bank's negotiators, who have
whittled Banesto down from an initial asking price of around Pta60bn.
Although Banesto will not be paid what it hoped for Banco de Madrid, the
agreement will come as a huge relief to its president Mr Mario Conde.
Banesto announced a 62 per cent fall in net group profits in 1992 earlier
this week.
But Banesto will make a clean profit, analysts in Madrid say, of Pta30bn
from the sale of Banco de Madrid. That, in turn, would enable it to almost
wipe clear Pta40bn of provisions the Bank of Spain has insisted it make by
next year for bad loans.
Following the transaction, which is subject to banking authorities'
approval, Deutsche Bank's Spanish operations will have assets of DM16bn
(Dollars 9.6bn) and employ 3,000 operating from 400 branches.
Deutsche Bank operates in the Spanish market through Banco Comercial
Transatlantico (BCT). Deutsche Bank took a majority stake in this
institution in 1989, the same year as the Pounds 950m (Dollars 1.35bn)
purchase of Morgan Grenfell, the UK merchant banking group which is
Deutsche's biggest foreign purchase to date.
The acquisition is part of Deutsche's strategy of cautious expansion in
foreign retail banking markets. In this business area it moved abroad in a
substantial way only in 1986 when it bought the Milan-based Banca d'America
e d'Italia. Italy and Spain remain the only two foreign countries where
Deutsche operates a full-scale retail banking network.
The acquisition is likely to coincide with a restructuring of the Banco de
Madrid and approximately 500 out of the 1,700 people currently employed by
the bank will remain with Banesto. After restructuring, the Banco de
Madrid's assets are likely to amount to DM6bn.

FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Ciga share trade suspended as
doubts on Situr deal mount

<TEXT>
SHARES IN CIGA, the Italian luxury hotel chain controlled by the Aga Khan,
were suspended yesterday pending a statement by the company.
The move followed reports in Italian newspapers that Situr, the
privately-owned group which last year agreed to acquire Ciga's hotel-owning
subsidiary, had discovered unspecified irregularities in its accounts.
The deal with Situr was a vital step in reducing the severe cash flow
problems at Ciga, which has built up debts of about L1,000bn (Dollars 639m).
After failing to sell some of its hotels, which include flagships such as
the Grand in Rome, the deal with Situr represented a lifeline for the
company.
Under the complex arrangement, Situr would have bought 51 per cent of Ciga
Immobialiare, the subsidiary which owns the group's 21 Italian hotels.
Combined with a linked transaction involving assets in Sardinia, the deal
would have provided around L300bn in cash.
The transaction, subject to approval by Ciga's banks, had run into
difficulties recently after opposition by many bank creditors. A steering
committee of banks has appointed Mediobanca, the Italian merchant bank, to
recommend alternatives for the group's future.
Matters reached a head this week, when Mr Luigi Clementi, Situr's managing
director, was quoted as saying the due diligence audit of Ciga's accounts,
to which the transaction was subject, had revealed certain unspecified 'very
important facts'.
A Ciga spokesman yesterday denied the claim. 'We are not aware of any facts
in relation to the latest statements of the company, which have been
formally certified by Price Waterhouse.'
With financial and stock market pressure on Ciga rising yesterday, the
three-way battle of wills between the company, its bankers and Situr looked
set to intensify.

PORSCHE, the troubled German luxury sports car maker, warned yesterday of a
further deterioration in its business position during this year as it
confirmed that losses in the six months to the end of January totalled
DM120m (Dollars 73m) compared with a first-half profit of DM3m in the
previous year.
Mr Wendelin Wiedeking, chief executive, who had given a hint of the extent
of first-half losses in January, said sales and profits for the full year to
the end of July would be down significantly. He gave no figure for the scale
of the full-year loss but said sales were likely to be between DM1.7bn and
DM1.9bn, down about a third from DM2.68bn in 1991-1992. The loss last year
was DM65.8m.
At the company's annual meeting near Stuttgart, Mr Wiedeking said the number
of cars produced this year would be 15,000 to 17,000, down from 23,000 last
year. Units sold fell 39 per cent in the first six months of the year, down
to 6,620. Sales in Germany tumbled 43 per cent to 2,907 units. Turnover for
the six months was down 35 per cent from DM1.255bn to DM820m.
Mr Wiedeking, appointed chief executive in September, reiterated the
company's determination to remain independent. He predicted that with a
revival in the world economy together with the introduction of planned new
models, unit sales would be back to more than 30,000 a year from 1996-1997.
Sales reached a peak in the mid-1980s when units sold exceeded 50,000.
Porsche intends to cut the cost base by 30 per cent by 1995. It is to shed
1,800 jobs in the current year.

performance for year

<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RABOBANK reported virtually flat net profits for 1992, but the Dutch
co-operative bank said it was satisfied with its performance considering the
difficult conditions it faced last year.
Net profit was little changed at Fl 1.02bn (Dollars 550m), compared with Fl
1.01bn a year earlier, in spite of what the bank described as a 'remarkable'
expansion of lending at a time of economic slowdown. Total outstanding loans
to the private sector were up 7 per cent last year at Fl 147.3bn.
Gross profits rose by 5.6 per cent to Fl 2.3bn.
However, risk provisions were raised by 7 per cent in line with the increase
in lending, while taxes jumped by almost 13 per cent, leaving net profit
steady on the previous year.
Rabobank said it faced a persistently inverted yield curve and fierce
competition, both of which drove up costs.
Total income, which includes interest, commission and other types of income,
expanded by 7.5 per cent to Fl 7.06bn but costs rose even faster, increasing
by 8.4 per cent to Fl 4.75bn.
Rabobank, the first of the big Dutch banks to release 1992 figures, said
income in 1993 will show a reduced rate of increase, reflecting expectations
of only marginal growth in the Dutch economy.

SANDVIK, the Swedish speciality steel and engineering group, saw profits
fall to SKr1.53bn (Dollars 200m) for 1992 as demand for its products
weakened. Although slightly higher than forecast, the figure was 20 per cent
lower than the SKr1.92bn profit in 1991.
The group is increasing the dividend to SKr9.50 from SKr9.00 per share
despite the decline, and said it expected higher sales and profits in 1993.
The current year is 'likely to be another year of reduced demand but the
weaker krona is increasing the competitiveness of our Swedish units,' the
company said.
Sales fell 2 per cent in 1992 to SKr17.2bn on a virtually unchanged order
intake of SKr17.33bn.
Sales to the EC, the group's main market, fell 2 per cent to SKr7.52bn, and
there was a 5 per cent fall to SKr3bn in sales to North America. Higher
sales in both Sweden and Latin America helped to compensate.
The group's cemented carbide activities saw earnings fall to SKr896m from
SKr1.18bn as sales dropped to SKr8.53bn from SKr9.01bn.
Steel operations recorded a SKr151m profit, SKr128m less than in 1991, on
sales which fell to SKr5.27bn from SKr5.57bn. Losses within saws and tools
deepened to SKr81m from SKr16m.

CREDIT SUISSE has joined the parade of international banks making huge
provisions for bad loans.
The banking group, Switzerland's third largest, said its provisions
ballooned last year to a record SFr1.5bn (Dollars 873m), a third above those
in 1991.
However, a robust 14 per cent rise in cash flow to SFr2.8m, thanks mainly to
higher commissions and trading profits, enabled the group to end with a
meagre 1.1 per cent rise in consolidated net income to SFr857m.
'Given the difficult economic climate, our results were thoroughly
satisfactory,' said Mr Robert Jeker, the outgoing chief executive.
Mr Josef Ackermann, incoming chief executive, forecast that cash flow would
'develop rather well' in the current year, but said that provisions would
remain substantial because of the continuing recession.
Mr Ackermann also warned of the costs of integrating Swiss Volksbank. Credit
Suisse has made an agreed SFr1.6bn takeover bid for the troubled Volksbank,
and completion is expected to be completed next month. Up to 2,000 jobs and
at least 100 of the two banks' 400 branches are to go.
Of total income of SFr5.8bn, 40 per cent came from lending. Improvements in
margins on an expanded loan book were offset by provisions against interest
rate risk of more than SFr200m.
Commission income rose 13 per cent to SFr1.66bn, reflecting higher revenues
from investment business and securities administration. Trading income
jumped 26 per cent to SFr1.6bn mainly because of a SFr202m surge in foreign
exchange dealing profits to SFr672m and a SFr172m jump in securities trading
profits to SFr440m.
Credit Suisse's 50 per cent interest in Credit Suisse Financial Products,
the CS Holding group's derivatives specialist, was SFr98m.
Mr Jeker said 35 per cent of cash flow came from overseas operations, up
from 34 per cent last year. On the other hand, two thirds of the bad loan
provisions arose in Switzerland.
Assets rose 11 per cent to SFr173bn, with SFr3bn of the rise coming from the
acquisitions of two Swiss regional banks and SFr3.7bn from the currency
effects. Lending was up 4 per cent to SFr99.9bn and customer deposits rose 8
per cent to SFr113.8bn.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Price
fall angers platinum producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS good news and bad news for producers of platinum group metals this
week. After Allied-Signal of the US announced on Tuesday that it had
developed a new palladium-only catalyst for cleaning car exhaust fumes the
price of that metal rose by more than 5 per cent. The trouble was that the
announcement raised the spectre of platinum's displacement from its biggest
single market, and its price fell by 1.75 per cent.
For the South African producers that account for more than half the world's
production of the two metals the palladium price rise would net an extra
Dollars 6m in a full year, while the platinum fall would cost them nearly
Dollars 16m. So they were far from pleased. And any relief they might have
felt when Allied-Signal backtracked on Wednesday, saying the new catalyst
would not replace platinum or rhodium based systems, was overcome by fury at
what they saw as another example of market manipulation.
'Is this fair play?' was the heading of a statement issued on Thursday by Mr
Michael McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, the second largest producer of
the metals. He complained of a series of incidents over the past few years
that had hit his company's earnings and in which he detected 'a common
thread'.
Initially, he said, there was overstatement of a position, 'causing severe
downward pressure on the PGM markets'. And these were quickly followed by 'a
retraction, withdrawal, or considerable watering down of the original
message'. That view was backed by Rustenburg Platinum, also of South Africa,
the biggest producer, which warned that continuing depressed prices might
force it to close down loss-making shafts.
While the London palladium price held on to most of its gains - yesterday's
fixing was Dollars 104.75 a troy ounce, up Dollars 4.60 on the week -
platinum made good most of its fall with a Dollars 3.55 rise yesterday to
Dollars 344.30 an ounce, down 70 cents on balance. But that was still
Dollars 25 down from three weeks ago, following an earlier fall that was
blamed by Mr Todd Bruce of Rustplats on claims 'for which there was no
factual support' that Japanese car makers were selling from their own stocks
of the metals.
At the London Metal Exchange it was one-way traffic again, with all base
metals contracts finishing lower on the week.
The sharpest decline was in copper, the cash price for which closed
yesterday at Pounds 1,474.50 a tonne, down Pounds 40 on the week. The
writing was on the wall on Monday when the three months copper price was
pushed through a support area around Dollars 2,150 a tonne to a fresh 3 1/2
 month low.
The main problem for the copper market is the disappearance of the bullish
factors that had been propping it up in January and February - initially
sustained Chinese buying and then floods in Arizona and strikes in Mexico -
while hopes of recovery in the US are being countered by concern about
European and Japanese car production prospects.
The mood of the market has been further undermined this week by an ominous
increase in arrivals from Russia, the source of the floods of aluminium and
nickel that have knocked the stuffing out of those markets. This 'could
prove the last straw for copper,' commented GNI, the London trading house,
in its daily market review yesterday.
The long shadow of the former Soviet Union also extended over the tin market
this week as merchants reported that the Commonwealth of Independent States
was also offering supplies of that metal, and at discount prices.
The gloom was lifted somewhat by yesterday's announcement of a modest
downturn in LME warehouse stocks of tin and the cash price closed at Dollars
5,670 a tonne, down Dollars 100 on the week but Dollars 25 above Wednesday's
low.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange traders were keeping an eye on
the International Cocoa Agreement negotiations in Geneva, though few held
out more than the faintest hope of a positive conclusion.
In the event the past fortnight's round of talks, regarded as a last ditch
attempt to clear the way for a pact with price-stabilisation clauses, was
effectively abandoned on Thursday with producer and consumer delegates still
far apart on the price range to be defended by a stock withholding scheme
and who should pay to finance the scheme.
It was decided, however, to adjourn, rather than to conclude, the meeting as
signs were discerned that some producing countries might be willing to make
big concessions on these questions.
That optimistic view did not seem to have filtered through to the London
market, however, where the May delivery position closed yesterday at Pounds
708 a tonne, down Pounds 41 on the week.
In the oil market the bullish implications of last month's agreement by
members of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut
production have been failing to dispel fears of continuing excess supply,
but prices managed to break out of the recent narrow trading ranges this
week as good refiner buying of crude was seen in Europe and signs emerged of
Indian demand.
The May delivery price at London's International Petroleum Exchange was
trading at Dollars 19.48 a barrel late yesterday up 54 cents on the week.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Close poised to pay Pounds 15m for
Winterflood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINTERFLOOD Securities, the specialist smaller company marketmaker, is
likely to be sold to the the merchant banking group Close Brothers for about
Pounds 15m.
News of the sale emerged yesterday as Union Discount, the troubled discount
house group which owns Winterflood, announced that talks over a possible
disposal of the entire group had been abandoned.
The sale of the Union group, the oldest specialist money market operator in
London, is understood to have foundered over the inability to agree a price
for its troubled leasing business.
The potential buyer, thought to have been rival discount house group Cater
Allen, is believed to have argued that the leasing portfolio could contain
further losses in the future.
Union, on the other hand, claimed that leasing had become a more profitable
business in the wake of the recent fall in UK interest rates.
The sale of the Winterflood business to Close Brothers would help to bolster
Union's balance sheet and boost its prospects as an independent company.
Union's independence was thrown in doubt last year after it was forced to
increase provisions against its leasing business, pushing its share price
down from a high of 500p in 1990 to around 50p.
Union's 1992 results, expected to be announced as early as next week, are
expected to show that its core short-term money market business has improved
as interest rates have fallen, in line with other discount houses.
Mr Brian Winterflood, who founded the marketmaking company in 1988 to
concentrate on USM and Third Market stocks, refused to comment on the
identity of the potential purchaser yesterday. He said, though, his company
would be 'very happy' with the new parent.
'We will not change from what we are presently doing,' he said. It is not
expected that there will be any redundancies.
Mr Winterflood said his company had seen an increase in turnover in trade in
smaller companies' shares, particularly in the last three months. In the six
months to June 30, Union Discount's equity and gilt edged marketmaking -
which includes Winterfloods and Aitken Campbell &amp; Co - contributed profits
of Pounds 2.7m.
Mr Rod Kent, managing director of Close Brothers, could not be contacted for
comment yesterday.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cookson to raise Pounds 185.6m via rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Cookson Group fell by 14p to 199p yesterday, after the industrial
materials company confirmed that it is raising Pounds 185.6m through a
1-for-4 rights issue priced at 170p.
The proceeds of the rights, which has been underwritten by Lazard Brothers,
will be used to repay debt, fund organic growth and make complementary
acquisitions.
Cookson raised Pounds 83m through a rights issue two years, after an
acquisitions spree in the late-1980s left it heavily burdened with debt.
Since then a new management team has undertaken a substantial restructuring
of the group, making selective disposals and refocusing it on four product
divisions.
The company also reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 72.5m for the year to
end-December, against a deficit of Pounds 7.9m last time. The comparisons
have been restated to conform with accounting rule FRS 3.
The 1991 figure was originally reported as a profit of Pounds 34.4m.
However, FRS 3 required the restatement of extraordinary items in 1991 to
include goodwill previously written off to reserves on sale or termination
of operations, and for these extraordinary items to be reclassified as
exceptional items.
Turnover declined by 5 per cent to Pounds 1.24bn (Pounds 1.3bn). However,
like-for-like turnover, adjusting for acquisitions, disposals and exchange
rate movements, increased by about 3 per cent.
Earnings per share were 9.4p against restated losses per share of 8.4p in
1991. Last year it reported earnings of 1.8p.
An unchanged final dividend of 3p is proposed, maintaining the total for the
year at 6p.
Operating profit before exceptional items increased to Pounds 94.5m, an
increase of 26 per cent over a restated Pounds 74.6m in 1991.
About 80 per cent of the group's business is outside the UK and the effect
of currency translation was to add Pounds 7.5m to sales last year and Pounds
1.1m to pre-tax profits.
All four divisions achieved increased operating profits after exceptional
items. The electronic materials division showed a 66 per cent increase to
Pounds 21.4m (Pounds 12.9m), while the ceramics division posted increased
operating profits of Pounds 38.5m (Pounds 31.4m). The engineering products
division turned in an Pounds 8.8m advance to Pounds 13.8m, boosted by the
acquisition in April last year of the remaining 50 per cent of Stern Leach.
The plastics division posted operating profits of Pounds 14.2m (Pounds
9.5m).
At the end of December the group had net borrowings of Pounds 341m,
including Pounds 77m of convertible preference shares, an increase of Pounds
125m from the end of 1991. The main reasons for the increase were Pounds 55m
of additional borrowings arising from the acquisition of the remaining 50
per cent stake in Stern Leach following the exercise of a put option by the
former joint venture partner, a Pounds 31m foreign currency translation
adjustment, and an increase in year-end working capital.
Gearing, which increased from 51 per cent at the end of 1991 to 74 per cent
at the end of 1992, will be reduced to below 30 per cent as a result of the
rights issue.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: USM closure decision by Easter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Stock Exchange is expected to announce a decision on the proposed
closure of the Unlisted Securities Market around Easter, following the
receipt of some 60 responses to its consultative document.
It is possible that the exchange will then consider forming a think tank, to
decide on the potential for either a second market or lower tiers to the
Official List. Any such body would have to include representatives from the
investment and corporate community, as well as advisers and venture
capitalists.
In a statement yesterday, the exchange pointed out that a viable consensus
from participants would have to be achieved on regulations for a second
market. Then the exchange would 'give every consideration to the need for a
second market and the role it could play'.
The overwhelming response to its document was an acceptance that the USM 'no
longer provides a distinctive smaller companies market'. European directives
on listing particulars meant that the Official List now had essentially the
same entry criteria as the USM.
'It must be at least questionable whether the exchange can substantially
reduce those requirements and still provide an appropriate regulatory regime
for investors.'
The City Group For Smaller Companies, the lobbying body set up following the
proposed demise of the USM, welcomed the exchange's statements. 'They have
recognised that there is a demand for investigating a secondary market,'
said Mr Andrew Beeson, chairman of Cisco. 'That process will now have to be
pulled together.'

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: FNFC may have to roll over some bank debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRST National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group, said
yesterday it might have to roll over some of its bank debt if it could not
get 'technical' breaches of loan agreements waived within the next few
weeks.
In First National Bank, its main subsidiary, between Pounds 200m and Pounds
250m of debt is repayable by the end of April.
As part of the refinancing, First National was close to raising Pounds 150m
through the securitisation of unsecured home improvement loans, organised by
Baring Brothers. But news of the breaches has put this on hold.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, said yesterday it would not
assign any rating to the proposed securitisation until First National Bank
had obtained written waivers from all relevant institutions of all the
outstanding breaches.
Mr Martin Mays-Smith, FNFC's chairman, yesterday described the breaches as
'misdemeanors that are old, insubstantial and technical'. They were to do
with infringing bans on guarantees between First National Bank and its
subsidiaries.
He said this might lead to a situation where there was a loan in default.
'But it is not absolutely certain.'
He thought it would take about a month to get the waivers. 'If the process
of getting the waivers drags on, it will be a problem of time not
substance.'
If there had to be some short-term roll-over of debt, he pointed to
'substantial undrawn facilities' and the proceeds of the recently announced
Pounds 45.8m rights issue.
Of the discussions that would have to take place with various banks to
obtain the waivers, he said: 'Given the viability of the business, we hope
they will be sympathetic.'
S&amp;P yesterday confirmed the triple A rating of First National Bank's Pounds
170m securitisation of second mortgages carried out last October.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hillsdown Pounds 150m write-off warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCKBROKERS are bracing themselves for large scale write-offs and
provisions when Hillsdown Holdings, the food group, reports 1992 results on
Tuesday. These could total Pounds 150m, with perhaps half going through the
profit and loss account as an extraordinary item.
However, analysts have been more positive about the group since the interims
last September, and the shares have doubled. They expect a bounce in
earnings in the current year.
Mr David Lang, food analyst at Henderson Crosthwaite, who is forecasting
pre-tax profits of Pounds 155m compared with Pounds 186.8m in 1991, said the
total of write-offs and provisions 'could approach Pounds 150m or could be
higher if the knife goes deeper'.
Sir Harry Solomon, executive chairman, announced in December that he would
retire at next month's annual meeting. It is thought that the new team,
headed by Sir John Nott, will take the opportunity of these results to
'clear the decks'.
The group will not apply FRS 3, the new accounting standard, which would
require restructuring costs to be taken as exceptional rather than
extraordinary items.
Hillsdown is likely to make provisions for restructuring and rationalisation
costs relating to the poultry division, following last year's purchase of
the JP Wood business, to the fresh meat business, to the Scottish salmon
farming operation, to a Pounds 7.6m provision against Clarke Foods and to
the Lyons Maid ice cream company which went into receivership in October
last year.
The balance sheet will be affected by goodwill write-offs from acquisitions,
such as the Pounds 50m purchase of the European chilled foods business of
Beledia, a private Dutch company. That company had net assets of Pounds 29m.
Earnings per share for 1992 are forecast at around 13p which would
comfortably cover a promised maintained annual dividend of 8.8p. That gives
a yield of 7.2 per cent on the share's closing price yesterday of 162p, up
3p, which brokers say gives support to the shares.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Schroder tops expectations with new trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroder has exceeded expectations in raising Pounds 100m for its new split
capital investment trust, called the Split Fund.
However, the demand was so unbalanced in favour of the income shares, which
yield 8 per cent tax-free if held in a Personal Equity Plan, that
applications for those shares have had to be scaled back.
Meanwhile, BZW and Schroders have been forced to buy around Pounds 27m of
the other two classes of shares, capital and zero dividend, in order to
create the right structure.
Between them, the two groups will own around 68 per cent of the zero
dividend shares and 35 per cent of the capital shares. Mr John Govett,
chairman of the Split Fund, said the shares were good investments.
In all 56.8m income shares, 37.7m zero dividend shares and 5.7m capital
shares have been allocated. Those who applied for under Pounds 25,000 of
income shares will receive all their allocation; applications above that
level will receive between 50 and 85 per cent.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Near 40% of Rutland shares changes hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST 40 per cent of the shares of Rutland Trust, the financial services
and property surveying group, changed hands yesterday
SPP, part of Trygg-Hansa, Sweden's largest insurance and pensions group,
yesterday placed its 32.5 per cent holding with a range of institutional
investors.
The shares were put through the market at 17p. The move will not trigger any
new disclosable holdings in Rutland.
It is understood the placing was oversubscribed, partly because of the
recent rise in the value of Rutland's 44 per cent owned associate Capital
Industries.
After the placing, Banque Arjil, part of the Matra-Hachette group, also had
its entire holding in Rutland placed, some 4.8 per cent at 18p.
Rutland's shares closed up 2p at 20p on the day.
The Swedish holding arose out of a 1986 consortium bid for Kellock Trust by
London and Edinburgh Trust and Mr Michael Langdon, now chief executive of
Rutland Trust. In 1989 SPP bought LET which has recently been loss-making,
for Pounds 500m.
Mr Langdon said: 'We are pleased to have replaced a weak shareholder which
overhung the market with a good quality institutional listing.' He said the
group was acquisitive and would continue to look for business opportunities
to fit its existing profile.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: David Brown rises 12%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAVID BROWN Group, the gear and pump manufacturer which is shortly to be
floated, increased pre-tax profits by 12 per cent to Pounds 9.3m in the year
to January 29. Sales were static at Pounds 81m (Pounds 80.9m), writes Andrew
Bolger.
The directors of this Huddersfield-based company, which was the subject of a
Pounds 46m management buy-in in 1990, said that strong cash flow had led to
a Pounds 3.2m fall in net borrowings, in spite of investment of Pounds 3.8m
in new businesses.
Gearing, which was 300 per cent after the buy-in, now stands at 28 per cent
and will be reduced further by proceeds from the flotation, which is
expected to give the group a market value of more than Pounds 70m.

FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Row may hit Greencore
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING row in the Republic of Ireland over the sale of the government's
remaining 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the sugar and foods company, now
looks increasingly likely to have a significant bearing on whether GPA, the
world's largest aircraft leasing company, succeeds in a debt restructuring
package with its banks to whom it owes Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.87bn).
With encouragement from the Greencore board, the US food conglomerate ADM,
last month made a IPounds 66m offer, equivalent to IPounds 2.60 per share,
for the government's Greencore stake. But under political pressure, the
government this week decided to open up the sale to other offers with the
express intention of trying to find an Irish buyer.
Mr Gerry Murphy, the Greencore chief executive, says that he does not
believe such a move is in the best interests of the company and that the
board 'will do everything in its power to ensure that our ability to pursue
our stated strategy is at least safeguarded and hopefully enhanced, by the
ultimate ownership of the government's stake'.
Without naming ADM, Mr Murphy said that the board had found a 'long-term
partner with similar and complementary long-term . . . (which) apart from
supporting the group with capital for development, would bring unparalleled
access to world class technology in our core business, global market
intelligence and distribution capability'.
He said the move had 'the full support of the board following months of
preparatory work' and added that 'the board does not believe that any
potential Irish investor could bring the same benefits to the group in our
drive to become a more significant and more successful Irish-based
international food company'. Mr Joe Walsh, the agriculture minister,
confirmed this week that the offer had come from ADM.
It is likely that the Greencore board will now seek institutional
shareholder support to block any government sale of which it does not
approve, under the company's articles of association. Any shareholder taking
more than a 15 per cent stake in the company requires shareholder approval.
The problem for the government is that the sale of IPounds 150m of
government assets is a key factor in this year's Budget arithmetic, and upon
it hinges the government's ability to rescue Aer Lingus, the state-run
airline which is in the process of sorting out its own major financial
difficulties.
Aer Lingus is a major shareholder in GPA and along with GPA's other
shareholders is being called upon to subscribe to a new USDollars 200m
preference share issue by the aircraft leasing group.
The issue is seen as the company's last chance to avoid the banks taking
over effective control. Aer Lingus, however, is unlikely to be in a position
to subscribe to the issue without government finance.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham bid has Pounds 3m value
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUCKINGHAM International, the hotels and nursing homes group, has produced
one of the more bizarre bids of the year.
A bidder that did not want to bid; an adviser that does not necessarily
advise rejection of the offer - even though it values Buckingham's ordinary
shares at less than 3 per cent of what auditors say the company is worth on
a long-term basis.
The bid was triggered because the Takeover Panel has ruled that Buckingham's
largest shareholder, Naaz Holdings, is acting in concert with Jemma, run by
one of the deputy chairman's relatives, and now have 38.7 per cent of the
common shares.
Naaz is a company owned by a trust of which Mr Nurdin Jivraj, Buckingham
deputy chairman, and Mr Nick Jivraj, his son and chief executive, and their
families are beneficiaries. The relative of Mr Nurdin Jivraj is beneficiary
of a trust run by Jemma.
Buckingham shareholders are being offered 2.75p for each ordinary, valuing
the offer at Pounds 3.3m, and 27.5p for each Pounds 1 nominal of loan stock,
valuing this offer at Pounds 9.1m. Buckingham's share price closed 0.25p
down at 4.5p.
The offer comes from Purlieus, a Jersey company owned by a trust of which Mr
Nick and Mr Nurdin Jivraj, are beneficiaries.
Advisers to the independent directors have advised that the loan stock offer
would be rejected.
The loan stock holders subscribed Pounds 33m only last year and are secured
on some of the group's properties.
The common stock offer is a different matter. Buckingham said that 1993 and
1994 would be 'tough years for the group in terms of meeting cash
requirements but the board believes these problems will be resolved'.
As a result, the independent advisers are not necessarily advising rejection
of the common stock offer. 'Shareholders who are convinced about the quality
and value of the Buckingham Group's assets and management may wish, despite
certain significant risks, to retain an ongoing interest in Buckingham',
said Robert Fleming, advisers.
This course of action might be taken in the light of the difference in the
offer value and net assets of Pounds 113m derived from the audited figures.
Net debt stands at Pounds 92.4m.
'Shareholders who are not confident in the prospects for Buckingham or who
are risk averse should consider selling in the market,' the advisers said.
Jemma bought its 8.6 per cent stake in Buckingham last September at a
maximum price of 2.75p. Panel rules say the offer needs to be made at the
highest price paid for the shares.

<TEXT>
Triton Europe, the independent oil and gas exploration and production
company, announced a change in direction at the same time as reporting a
sharp decline in interim after-tax profits from Pounds 2.61m to Pounds
61,000.
The company blamed the continuing decline at Villeperdue, its principal
source of production, together with a lower sterling equivalent oil price.
Under a review of its operations, French exploration is to be reduced
significantly and producing fields where Triton is operator are to be
disposed of. The company expects that after the restructuring staffing
levels will have been reduced by about 75 per cent.
It wants to concentrate on exploration activities in Europe and North
Africa.
Turnover in the first half to November 30 fell to Pounds 9.37m (Pounds 12m)
and gross profit to Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 4.39m). Earnings per share came
through at 0.07p (3.17p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITTON GROUP, the pack-aging company formed last October after the
acquisition by Firstland Group of Gelpack Industrial, yesterday reported a
pre-tax deficit of Pounds 2.32m for the year to end-December.
That compared with losses of Pounds 743,000 last time incurred on the
company's discontinued oil and gas activities.
Mr Robin Williams, chief executive, said the acquisition of GIL was
completed on November 2. Consequently, the results included less than nine
weeks' contribution from the packaging operations and principally reflected
a Pounds 2.1m loss on the sale of the oil and gas assets.
Turnover for the year totalled Pounds 2.28m, of which Pounds 345,000 came
from discontinued activities. For the previous year the figure was Pounds
393,000.
Losses per share came out at 5.16p (3.34p) and, as foreshadowed, a token
dividend of 0.03p is proposed.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Wheway urges holders to accept McLeod bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAPLESS shareholders of Wheway, the environmental engineering group,
yesterday watched their troubled company slide towards the waiting hands of
McLeod Russel, the paints production and distribution group, as directors
recommended acceptance of its 1-for-10 share bid.
At the annual general meeting in Birmingham about 150 shareholders, having
just received news of the recommendation, vented resigned wrath against the
absent Mr John McGowan, once chairman and chief executive.
He has left Wheway with a reported pay-off of Pounds 400,000. 'The
entitlements in his contract were bigger than what we settled for,' said Mr
Hugh Ashton, the current chairman, as he stonewalled. 'You can't blame Mr
McGowan solely for the difficulties into which Wheway has got itself.'
Those problems include a 1991-92 pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.5m, qualified
accounts, restructured credit lines at what the annual report said were
'very heavy cost,' net bank borrowings of Pounds 14.4m against shareholders'
funds of Pounds 15.3m and a share price which tumbled from 140p in 1989 to
6.5p last Christmas.
McLeod's shares fell 5p to 95p yesterday, valuing its offer for Wheway
shares at 9 1/2 p. They fell  1/4 p to 9 1/2 p valuing the company at Pounds
13.3m.
Mr Nigel Openshaw, McLeod's chairman, overcoated and flanked by his
executives, watched the shareholders' frustration and felt afterwards that
Mr Ashton had come off lightly. Mr McGowan's pay-off he thought was
'astronomical. I don't believe in rewarding failure.'
His team is waiting to move in at Wheway. Where that leaves Mr Richard Long,
chief executive for three weeks, is unclear. 'I've never met Mr Long,' said
Mr Openshaw. 'Probably I'd have one or two questions about his contract.' Mr
Long is reported to have received a Pounds 200,000 inducement to join
Wheway.

JOHNSON &amp; Firth Brown, the metals and engineering group, has expanded in the
US with the acquisition of Viking Metallurgical Corporation from Quanex
Corporation for Dollars 12.3m (Pounds 8.6m), writes Peter Pearse.
Based in Reno, Nevada, Viking manufactures seamless rolled rings and
forgings and electron beam-melted materials, mainly for the aerospace engine
components, industrial gas turbines and general engineering industries.
Viking's pre-tax profits for the year ended October 31 1992 fell to Dollars
1.03m (Pounds 720,000) against Dollars 1.95m due to sales falling to Dollars
28.7m (Dollars 34m).
Half the consideration will be paid in cash and the balance in a
non-negotiable interest-free note maturing on February 28 1994. Quanex also
received Dollars 500,000 representing cash movements at Viking since
December 31.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NORMAN WILLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Citizen's Advice Bureaux report on growing exploitation of people
at work ('Unfair dismissals increasing', March 2) must surely add to concern
about the nation's moral decline. The way in which people are treated at
work is just as important as behaviour outside.
The government is encouraging exploitation through its refusal to accept
basic social standards set by other European Community countries and through
the Trade Union Reform Bill which removes the limited protection of the
Wages Councils and makes it harder for unions to help those being exploited.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Towers of strength at a time of disaster: Three of New
York's finest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Disasters have a knack of catapulting individuals into the limelight - and
the blast which rocked New York's World Trade Center complex last week was
no exception.
Three men have captured both the city's and the nation's attention: Stanley
Brezenoff, the burly, 55-year-old executive director of the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey, which owns and operates the World Trade Center
complex; Raymond Kelly, the veteran New York city policeman who became the
city's 37th police commissioner in October; and James Fox, head of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation's New York office.
These three spearheaded an emergency response which has been widely viewed
as efficient, humane and relatively free of strife between different public
agencies. Whether such commendation would have persisted had investigations
flagged or further incidents occurred is open to question. In the event,
Thursday's arrest of Mohammed Salameh, a Moslem fundamentalist, placated
most critics.
The division of responsibilities quickly became clear. After an inter-agency
meeting at Mayor David Dinkins's offices last Sunday morning, Brezenoff,
crumpled and in a cardigan, emerged to handle questions about the safety of
the seven-building complex and the tenants' fate.
Visitors to New York usually associate the Port Authority with a notoriously
sleazy bus terminal on 8th Avenue. Even New Yorkers think of it principally
in terms of the PATH (Port Authority Trans Hudson) train system which
connects New Jersey with Manhattan. But the PA is a massive agency, with a
Dollars 2.7bn annual budget and jurisdiction over the region's airports,
tunnels, bridges and harbour operations, as well as five industrial parks
and the WTC.
Brezenoff himself was on the 67th floor of One World Trade Center, one of
the twin towers which dominate Manhattan's skyline, when the blast occurred.
He directed staff off the floor and helped carry a wheelchair-bound
colleague down dozens of flights of stairs.
He reached the ground about five hours after the explosion, by which time
the mayor's Office of Emergency Management, which co-ordinates the city's
rescue efforts during disasters, had begun to act. Brezenoff went straight
to the makeshift command centre set up in the devastated Vista hotel's
ballroom.
Over the weekend, Brezenoff set up temporary headquarters in a nearby
Marriott hotel and helped arrange for New York's futures exchanges, which
share a trading floor at Four World Trade Center, to open on Monday.
Many of the WTC's largest tenants are big financial firms with other office
locations nearby and so able to fend for themselves. For example, Deloitte &amp;
Touche, the accountancy firm, which had 1,200 people working on seven floors
of one WTC tower, relocated them without the help of the Port Authority. New
York state set up a Dollars 5m assistance scheme, providing interest-free
loans for small businesses displaced by the disaster.
However, Brezenoff has found himself deflecting charges that the Port
Authority ignored reports in the mid-1980s and 1991 which highlighted safety
flaws at the WTC. Lawsuits were filed within days of the blast, and
Brezenoff expects 'these will multiply. We carry property damage and
liability insurance which I believe will cover everything for which we may
be liable.'
Over the longer term, Brezenoff may face a harder task. There is a question
mark over future confidence in the centre, particularly if it acquires a
reputation as a terrorists' target. By Thursday, the New York Times was
reporting that three tenants or potential tenants of the WTC - Rollins Hudig
Hall, an insurance company, Bank of America and Fiduciary Trust, an
investment bank - were reconsidering leasing space or extending their leases
in the downtown location. Brezenoff responded quickly, arranging for
Fiduciary Trust's chairman to lead Thursday's daily press briefing with a
declaration that the company was concluding negotiations for a second
20-year lease on its offices and had no intention of leaving the WTC. In
addition, Brezenoff said the Port Authority signed a new lease within days
of the blast for a 7,000 sq ft restaurant in the centre.
Public wariness may also have been allayed by the fact that the
investigation into the bombing is being handled jointly by the FBI and the
New York Police Department's bomb squad, one of the oldest and largest US
municipal forces.
The NYPD has emerged with its reputation enhanced over the past week, thanks
largely to Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly. The Irish-American grew up on
Manhattan's West Side, once worked as a stock-boy at Macy's department
store, and has been with the police department for three decades.
Nevertheless, his appointment as commissioner came at a delicate time. Last
autumn, police corruption was dominating the local tabloid press, and public
confidence in the NYPD was at low ebb. Vocal sections of the police force
claimed that their work was being undermined by city officials - in
particular, by Mayor Dinkins - who appeared more anxious to support the
city's many racial minorities than back the force.
The bombing is the first serious incident with which Kelly has had to
grapple as commissioner, and it has neatly deflected attention from these
thorny local issues. Kelly's public image as no-nonsense and
straight-talking has been polished by his daily TV appearances, and for once
the city is confronting an event on which public opinion is united.
James Fox, the FBI director, has remained a more enigmatic figure. Fox
appears in the public eye during times of local crisis - most recently in
February when a hijacked Lufthansa jet landed at Kennedy Airport - only to
slip back into the shadows once the emergency has passed. In New York, Fox
is best known for his comments after mafia boss John Gotti was convicted on
murder and racketeering charges in April: 'The Teflon is gone. The don is
covered with Velcro, and all the charges stuck.'
In spite of the apparent goodwill among the agencies, by yesterday, strains
between city and federal law enforcement bodies were starting to show. There
were recriminations that news leaks by federal officials had forced a
premature arrest of Mr Salameh, and hampered investigations.
Nevertheless, co-operation between New York's public agencies this week
reflects their cool professionalism under fire and may pave the way for
closer relations in future.

<TEXT>
Sir, The FT calls it Black Wednesday, Sir Denys Henderson insists that it
was Sunny Wednesday, and others describe it as Golden, White or Wise.
It was a retreat from an ill-prepared venture into Europe. It caused much
financial bloodshed among those directly involved and those who gave support
from Britain.
It was technically a defeat, but was soon celebrated as a triumph. It
enabled this country to recover, and, we hope, go on to win the economic
war.
It has, of course, to be Dunkirk Wednesday.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Sheffield makes a sacrifice: Why city council workers voted
to take a pay cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an air of pride in Sheffield this week, where nearly 20,000 council
workers have voted to take a 3.5 per cent pay cut in exchange for an hour
off the working week or seven days' extra holiday, so as to avert 1,400
sackings.
'It's very, very positive,' said Don Lyon, chief executive of H Turner &amp;
Son, one of Britain's few remaining locally owned wholesale newspaper
distributors and former president of Sheffield Chamber of Commerce.
'They have behaved in an inspiring way,' said Hugh Sykes, chairman of the
government-funded Sheffield Development Corporation and a former Master
Cutler - the title given to the yearly presidency of the Cutlers' Company,
the ancient association of Sheffield manufacturers.
With a government-imposed spending limit of Pounds 366m, Sheffield has been
struggling to set a legal budget for 1993-94. The city council warned at
Christmas that about 1,400 sackings might be needed to save on the wages
bill. Nationally, about 90,000 local government jobs will probably be axed
over the next year.
The dilemma for the council was no different from that facing many others in
England and Wales. The government is determined to keep council spending
down so that the new council tax - the replacement for the poll tax - can be
held as low as possible.
Rather than cut staff to keep within government spending limits, Sheffield
decided to take another route. The council and the unions negotiated the
pay-cut solution so that more workers would not be added to the city's
unemployment rate of about 14 per cent.
Much of the credit is being given to Mike Bower, who became leader of the
Labour-controlled council last April. Since 1980, he has organised the
Co-operative Development Agency in Sheffield, which promotes the formation
of workers' co-operatives. Before that he worked as a full-time official of
the National Union of Journalists after a career on the Sheffield Star, the
city's evening paper.
According to his colleagues, he is a skilled negotiator who rejects
confrontation. He has helped set up 42 workers' co-operatives with about 300
employees in the past 12 years.
Despite Mr Bower's skills, the talks were not wholly successful. Shop
stewards for nearly 2,000 manual workers in the works department launched a
successful campaign for a No vote on the deal. Mr Bower has since been in
daily negotiation with the shop stewards and is confident of forging a
separate deal.
Another group of town hall workers who voted against the wage cuts later
reversed the decision. They comprised 529 members of Cohse, the health
services union.
'The person who explained it initially hadn't been at the negotiations,' one
council employee said. 'Once the background was understood, there was
overwhelming support.'
The reversal improved overall support for the controversial pay cut to about
61 per cent of the workforce. With the exception of the works department, it
will now be universally imposed. Voting figures, however, showed more
enthusiasm for the deal among white-collar workers than blue-collar ones.
Nalgo, the main office workers union, voted 65 per cent in favour, compared
with 53 per cent among the GMB general union. Nupe, which represents
lower-paid manual workers, showed 57 per cent support, while members of the
Transport and General Workers Union were only just in favour, at 51 per
cent.
Some council staff remain unhappy, feeling that the city should have found a
way of persuading the government to raise the ceiling on its spending. But
most did not see this as a serious option because of the government's
determination to hold down local government spending. Others - mainly
lower-paid workers - said they voted against the proposal because they
personally could not afford the cut.
But despite opposition, the deal has brought plaudits for its principal
architect. At a breakfast meeting this week, Mr Bower was congratulated on
doing a good job for Sheffield's image by leaders of the Cutlers' Company,
the Chamber of Commerce, the development corporation, and the city's two
universities.
Much government funding for Sheffield comes through the development
corporation, which receives Pounds 20m-Pounds 30m a year for economic
revival. It is now developing office blocks, which Sheffield needs to
attract white-collar jobs.
Mr Lyon, chairman of the Sheffield Partnership, a forum of public and
private sector activists, says that over the longer term the council will
have to shed white-collar jobs. Unless the city can attract companies
through the provision of quality offices, the likelihood of their finding
jobs is remote. 'No one would willingly add to unemployment at the moment,'
he says, 'but longer-term the council will have to reduce numbers to fit its
size as an enterprise.'
Ironically, Mr Bower agrees. He says the council has too many layers of
supervision and management and this is where he expects long-term reform to
make the most impact on jobs.
'We need to cut the cost of services without cutting the services,' he said.
'We can devolve much more responsibility down the line. My experience in the
co-operative movement has taught me people will behave responsibly if they
are given responsibility.'
Many will feel this week's ballot underlines his point.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Letter: Smith pledge on human rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GRAHAM ALLEN MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While welcoming the warm reception you provided for John Smith's
commitment towards incorporating the European Convention on Human Rights
(Leader, March 3 1993), I must take issue with your assertion that a
Ministry of Justice and a Commission on Human Rights would be 'over-egging
the pudding'.
If a Human Rights Bill is to succeed, it will require a fundamental shift in
attitudes. New institutions will have to be set up and old ones reformed if
the transformation of our constitution and society is to be real rather than
merely cosmetic.
For citizens to feel confident in the judges who protect their rights, there
must be fundamental shifts both in their method of appointment and their
training. Currently our senior judiciary are appointed by the Lord
Chancellor's department in a process free from even the most basic scrutiny.
That process must be made more open, and subject to review by the
legislature - perhaps by a Legal Affairs Departmental Select Committee or
Committee of both Houses.
The law, as defender of individual rights, will have to be made more
accessible. A Ministry of Justice responsible for, but separate from, our
legal system is a necessary prerequisite for genuine judicial reform.
Accountability to Parliament could take place through a Secretary of State
for Justice.
To assist ordinary people in their claims for redress, a Commission on Human
Rights is vital. Citizens who have had their rights violated but do not have
the time, expertise or financial means to pursue their case should be able
to seek the assistance of the Commission where necessary.
In addition, the Commission would be capable of identifying areas of concern
over rights, pursuing test cases and suggesting codes of good practice, in
much the same way that the Commission for Racial Equality does in relation
to anti-discrimination legislation.
Labour's Democratic Agenda, as expounded by John Smith on Monday, is radicaI
and far-reaching. It seeks to challenge every part of our outdated and
archaic constitution. Merely incorporating the ECHR and legislating for
freedom of information is not enough.
Alongside must come a commitment to reviewing, and if necessary replacing,
institutions devised before the advent of popular democracy.
Graham Allen,
Labour frontbench spokesperson
on the Constitution,

FT  06 MAR 93 / Letter: Tax avoidance is for all - not just Mr/Ms Average
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN B KERSHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Since when has the right to take all possible legal steps to minimise
his or her tax bill been restricted to the AVERAGE British citizen as stated
in your leader ('John Birt Inc', March 2)?
Lord Tomlin's dictum, which laid down the accepted standard for fair
taxation, actually read as follows: 'EVERY man is entitled if he can to
arrange his affairs so that the tax attaching under the appropriate Acts is
less than it otherwise would be.'
Are you suggesting that some tribunal be empowered to decide which citizen
is to be classified as 'average' for these or maybe other applications of
the law?
Alternatively, you no doubt think it reasonable that such judgmental power
may rest with the members of that fair-minded institution, the press, who
would of course never stoop to arrange their affairs so as to pay the least
tax legally possible.

FT  06 MAR 93 / America searches for the right thing to do: President
Clinton is proceeding with caution until a solution to the conflict in
Bosnia becomes clearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There is a serious public debate in America over what course the new Clinton
administration should take towards the war in Bosnia. It has been heightened
this week by the first US air-drops of relief supplies into eastern Bosnia,
by more vicious Serbian assaults, by the resumption of peace negotiations at
the UN, and even by the suspicion, exacerbated by some typically offensive
remarks by Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, that the bombing of
New York's World Trade Center last week might have its roots in the Balkans.
But it is a debate with more opinions than solutions, as President Bill
Clinton, no longer a candidate inclined to argue in favour of intervention
on the Moslem side, is finding out. This week alone has seen a catholic
range of public commentary.
'The main problem with my idea of limited western intervention to create a
fair fight in Bosnia is that I can't sell it to anyone in power.' So wrote,
despairingly, Les Gelb, the New York Times's foreign affairs columnist. Even
if President Clinton bought his arguments to bomb the Serbs and arm the
Moslems, he added, 'he would have a very tough time getting western Europe,
Russia or the UN to go along'.
In the Washington Post, Henry Kissinger, no less, took a more positive view,
though with several caveats about retaining the option to use force. The
former secretary of state wrote that 'as a way to devise an honourable
diplomatic role for the US . . . the Clinton administration's position on
the Bosnia negotiations is extremely skilful and deserves support'.
An editorial in the Los Angeles Times neither wept nor thundered. 'The time
has come to accept the fact that Serb aggression in Bosnia will not be
stopped any time soon', the newspaper observed with resignation.
Those with intimate knowledge of Bosnia had their say in breakfast
briefings. Fred Cuny, the hard-nosed consultant on humanitarian issues who
was influential in persuading the Bush administration to intervene in
Somalia, reported that the objective circumstances for a settlement in
Bosnia still did not exist because all the warring parties 'unrealistically
think they can still win'. He would not arm the Moslems, because it would
only make the violence worse, but would compel the Bosnian Serbs to stop
shelling Sarajevo.
General Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national security adviser and old
Yugoslavia hand, was sniffy about the air-drops and wary about greater US
engagement unless the conflict widened. He would tighten the economic screws
on Serbia by helping Romania sustain the Danube river traffic embargo. In
the Gulf, he argued, US vital interests were clearly seen and militarily
achievable: in Bosnia, no way out for the US ever presented itself while he
was involved in policy. He thought that President Clinton was coming round
to the same conclusion.
This proliferation of different advice attests to the lack of any
groundswell of opinion behind a particular course of action comparable to
that before the Somali and Kurdish interventions. This week, national
attention has been diverted by the violent siege of a heavily armed
religious sect in Texas. There has been some vivid reporting from Bosnia,
especially by John Burns of the New York Times, but the words and pictures
have not always commanded the top of the news lists.
To a degree the diffusion of argument has helped the administration, which
has been given some time to devise its own policies and to concentrate on
its first order of business, the selling of the president's economic
programme. But, reflecting Mr Clinton's own compulsion to explain
everything, it has, unlike its predecessor, not been reticent in talking
about its aims.
When Warren Christopher, the secretary of state, announced the new US
diplomatic and humanitarian approach to Bosnia three weeks ago, he did so
after a long preamble covering past mistakes, moral issues, and a very
definite assertion of a US strategic vital interest - not because of the
importance of Bosnia itself but because it was a part of Europe, and
European security was essential to the US.
Last week, Ms Jennone Walker, of the national security council, went further
in defining the US commitment to European security. She talked of the
imperative of engaging Russia as an active military partner not only in the
Balkans but elsewhere in continental conflict resolution alongside US troops
and in various combinations involving Nato, the Western European Union, the
Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe, and the United Nations.
But the hypothetical generalities of a new European security order do not
specifically address the difficulties of coming up with a workable and
particular Bosnian plan. The air-drops are, the administration concedes,
only a supplement to ground convoy relief, though symbolically important
because they demonstrate the US willingness to get involved.
The New York negotiations are trickier. While assigning Reginald
Bartholomew, the veteran diplomat, to participate in the Vance-Owen peace
process, the administration is publicly sceptical about the Bosnian 'map'
drawn up by the UN and EC negotiators. Mr Christopher bluntly said that it
needed simplifying.
The moral reservations - that Serbian aggression and ethnic cleansing are
being rewarded - are much less than the practical considerations of the
extent of the US role in monitoring a peace agreement covering 10
semi-autonomous provinces with disputed borders. Aware of the beckoning
quagmire, Mr Christopher insisted that the US contribution to peacekeeping
operations might place greater emphasis on air power and not require as many
as 15,000 ground troops.
But that number is still the minimum working hypothesis in the UN and it
represents a US deployment that the administration would find hard to sell
politically and to its own military high command. Every time Mr Clinton and
his secretary of state are questioned over Bosnia, they are asked about how
many US ground forces are going to be put at risk.
Mr Christopher has frankly admitted that Serb territorial gains were
unlikely to be rolled back completely in any settlement requiring Serb
signature. Swallowing this reality might be difficult, but Mr Cuny makes the
point, which the negotiators may explore, that the Moslems still hold most
of the valuable agricultural, mineral and commercial land, which, if
retained, could form the basis of a viable new Bosnia within defensible
borders.
But a settlement is not in place and is even further from guaranteed
acceptance by the warring parties. In its absence, as Messrs Clinton and
Christopher repeatedly make clear, the option of doing nothing has been
rejected not only for humanitarian reasons but because if the US is not
active nobody else will fill the void. Only the US can get a positive
Russian contribution: only the US can ginger a rudderless Europe into doing
more than mostly wringing its political hands; only the US has the muscle to
ensure that the frontline relief work of the UN High Commission for Refugees
under Mrs Sadako Ogata, be recognised and lifted above the morass of UN
bureaucratic infighting.
And, as a moving report by Mr Burns from beseiged Goradze attested, the US
is also uniquely qualified to bring hope where it matters most. 'To those
who often eat no more than a slice of bread a day, all the cavilling that
has greeted the air-drop seems irrelevant.' Yet his newspaper buried his
account on an inside page, an editorial judgment which reflects how hard it
is for Americans to sense what is the best thing to do in Bosnia. It is no
wonder Mr Clinton is proceeding with caution.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Letter: Whining and dining with the food-loving Belgians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC BOSCHMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I was sorry to see that Jancis Robinson ('Baffling Belgians in the
course of a meal', Weekend, February 20/21) has been left with the indelible
impression that all Belgians behave as if we're more Catholic than the Pope
in matters gastronomic.
We restaurateurs certainly have to hack our share of old fogeys here, and it
sounds as if Ms Robinson met most of them on her truffle, foie-gras and
wine-tasting binge in Leuven.
What bad luck some of them even took it upon themselves to pursue her to
London. I'm sorry to say some members of the Belgian foodie press take
themselves more seriously than we do.
It's a shame they're more impressed with ritual than content. Few have
expertise to rival that of the FT's resident Master of Wine.
As president of Belgium's Association of Professional Sommeliers, raised in
the business, I agree we take food and wine extremely seriously here. That's
why many of us are dedicated to innovation on all fronts.
We like trying out the best from nowhere and elsewhere, and we do not vet
our guests to check if they're worthy of our services.
I personally stock over three dozen new world wines, and Ms Robinson is
welcome to try any or all of them with her soup any time.
It's easier to get a good, well-priced, attractive meal without stifling
ceremony in Brussels than in London or Paris. Even the very best in the
country wouldn't intimidate or bankrupt a young couple once in a while.
Ms Robinson should come to Belgium again. Next time, she should find out
what's going on in the street and keep out of high temples of gastronomy
where it's still heresy to drink wine for fun and have a good time.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Mr Lamont's mountain
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM HAS been back in fashion this week, certainly in the stock market,
where the indices have been hitting new highs in London and - almost - New
York. Investors, it seems, are becoming less inhibited by the patchy
evidence of underlying economic improvement. In the UK, new houses have
started to sell faster and the car market is coming off the bottom. Against
that, the astonishing news that Sheffield council workers have voted to
accept a 3.25 per cent pay cut is evidence of the weakness of the labour
market as well as the growing realism of workers. Even in the US, where the
recovery is much better founded, some of the data are looking less bouncy.
The underlying explanation for stock market buoyancy is not to be found in
the real economy but in the remarkable surge in bond markets around the
world. Yields on dollar and D-Mark bonds have dropped by half a percentage
point over the past month. Little has been happening to short-term interest
rates so far - although the Bundesbank is sending out ever-clearer smoke
signals that a cut in its officially posted rates is imminent - but
long-term rates have been tumbling.
Gilt-edged yields have fallen a little less rapidly than those in many other
government bond markets, yet even so their showing represents an unexpected
bonus for Mr Norman Lamont as he finalises his Budget. Last autumn, when
gilt-edged yields reached 9 1/2 per cent, the fear was that the 1993-94
fiscal deficit might look intimidating. Today the market is eagerly lapping
up gilts on yields of well under 8 1/2 per cent. The pressure is off, and in
this mood the markets might scale a borrowing Everest. But the chancellor
would be unwise to take his good fortune for granted.
Sterling, too, has bounced off the bottom. From a low of around DM2.33 last
week it has flipped back up to DM2.41, partly on a Bank of England
declaration that the UK would not follow German interest rates downwards.
Continental alarm
Concern in continental Europe about the recession now setting in has turned
to something closer to alarm. Grim figures from Philips on Thursday
confirmed the structural inadequacy of much of European manufacturing
industry, which has been made worse by currency overvaluation.
In the past the Bundesbank has been prepared to cut interest rates very
sharply when the German economy has turned weak. Once it is confident it has
broken the back of inflation, there is scope for short-term rates to come
down a long way. For the financial markets that implies a weakening of the
D-Mark and the other ERM currencies, and suddenly British assets are
beginning to look more interesting as the conviction becomes more widespread
that sterling may have turned.
The UK is some way ahead of the Continent in the cycle of recession, so that
although the past few days have seen Barclays Bank writing off an
unprecedented Pounds 2.5bn in bad debts, at the same time share prices in
general have been advancing to new peaks. The cautious money may now try to
tap into the upsurge in UK financial assets, but bolder spirits may try to
anticipate the eventual turnround in Germany and France.
UK implications
For the UK, the continental recession has conflicting implications. The
release of financial resources across Europe will bring down interest rates
and exchange rates, reducing some of the Bank of England's fears about
imported inflation. Surplus capital flows will make it easier for the
British government to attract foreign finance for its deficit. On the other
hand, the prospects for exports are obviously damaged, despite the gains in
competitiveness that have been brought about by the escape from the ERM.
Whatever the financial green shoots, employment prospects have become
scarcely less grim. Social strains are growing. And this week has brought a
rare dispute at Ford, as the company seeks to exploit its greater bargaining
power in a rapidly weakening labour market. A symbolic statement of the
dramatic shifts taking place in the global economy has come with reports
that the Ravenscraig steel plant so controversially closed down is likely to
be shipped to Malaysia and reassembled by an Indonesian company.
So although the London stock market is making new highs the momentum is not
great, with the FT-SE 100 Index up less than 3 per cent since the beginning
of January. In the UK bonds are outperforming equities so far in 1993, as
they have in most other countries for the past two years.
The markets are in long-unexplored territory here, because gilt-edged yields
are lower than for 20 years. The evidence from the US, however, is that the
buoyancy of the bond market can survive even a reasonable economic upturn,
although the US bond market has at least had the benefit of promises (though
not the fact) of greater fiscal virtue. For gilts the global bull market in
bonds has brought unexpected stimulus, but Mr Lamont will still have to do
his stuff.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Rarely has it been so uncomfortable, in business, to be small. That much is
clear from the huge provisions announced over the past fortnight by the
British clearing banks against their lending to small companies. While
British Gas was able to raise Pounds 400m in the bond markets this week at
the drop of a hat, small borrowers lucky enough to have survived thus far in
the recession have been warned, in a recent speech by Midland Bank's chief
executive Mr Brian Pearse, that they are a poor commercial proposition for
the banks. Given that small firms play a disproportionate part in job
creation, bankerly restraint in the sector could point to a joyless economic
recovery.
In the UK, small firms are suffering a far worse fate than in the recession
of the early 1980s. Then, the squeeze was transmitted through an overvalued
exchange rate, so that the recession was largely confined to the tradeable
goods sector of the economy. Today, in contrast, the damage has been done by
high interest rates, as well as by the exchange rate, with the result that
purely domestic businesses in the service sector have been savaged as well.
Now that rates have fallen and sterling has come out of the European
exchange rate mechanism, many small businessmen complain that they are being
squeezed in other ways, as the banks increase charges for each and every
service. In an emotive debate, marked by claim and counter-claim, banks like
the Royal Bank of Scotland have not helped their case by offering bonus
schemes for employees who find ways of burdening clients with new fees. But
the more fundamental question is whether a credit crunch in small business
poses a wider threat to the economy.
A credit crunch is a controversial concept. Bankers are usually reluctant to
admit that they are turning down creditworthy customers. They are prone to
ask: how can credit be scarce if interest rates are falling? That rhetorical
question does not, of course, preclude the possibility of a crunch in
individual sectors of the economy; and there is plenty of anecdotal evidence
that in the over-indebted economies of the US, Britain and Japan there has
been a real constraint on lending to property and small business.
It should, nonetheless, be common ground that bankers are nervous about the
pricing of their loans both to property and small business in relation to
the perceived risks. They also feel an urgent need to rebuild their capital
after the huge losses they have incurred in these areas. That need is made
more pressing by the new capital ratio requirements of the Bank for
International Settlements - the introduction of which could hardly have been
worse timed for recovery. Similarly, it is beyond dispute that the response
of both consumers and businessmen to an overhang of debt is one of extreme
caution before borrowing further. The result is that corporate finance has
become polarised as never before between big and small companies.
The cost of capital is now falling sharply across the developed world as
bond prices soar, causing yields to fall (see chart). The equity markets are
following suit; and in the English-speaking economies, big companies are
enthusiastically raising fresh equity and debt. Since they are often more
creditworthy than their bankers, it also pays them to issue short-term IOUs
directly in the markets instead of borrowing from banks. In contrast, small
businesses, which are excluded from the capital markets, are caught in a
double bind. Not only are the banks disenchanted with them. The property
collateral that underpins so much small firm borrowing is shrinking because
property is the other big source of bankerly disenchantment.
The message in this for the UK is that a credit crunch will not be a
constraint on any export-led recovery, since it is the larger manufacturing
companies that spearhead the export effort. But there will certainly be a
problem for job creation, because higher productivity in manufacturing means
that jobs are less easily generated there than in services. Normally, the
higher disposable incomes generated by productivity improvement in
manufac-turing would benefit the service economy. But if the banks have
pulled in their horns, the benefit will be less than it should be.
In one sense, this is simply a new version of an old British problem. When
the Bolton committee produced its report on small firms in 1971, it found
that the small business sector in Britain was in a deeper decline than in
any other industrialised country. Things appeared to improve in the 1980s
when there was a sharp upturn in small business formation and much talk of
an entrepreneurial culture. And indeed, between 1980 and late 1992 the
service sector, which includes most small businesses, was the exclusive
generator of new employment in the economy, producing more than 1.5m net new
jobs.
During that time small business increased its share of all employment from
59.6 per cent to 71.6 per cent, while manufacturing declined from 30.3 per
cent to 21.2 per cent. Within that shift, Whitehall estimates that small
business created around 1m jobs in the second half of the 1980s. Yet on
closer examination, the striking thing about the figures is that the service
industries that generated the biggest job growth were not ones in which
small business was obviously predominant.
Banking, finance and insurance produced the largest number of jobs (see
chart) at 1.1m, which owes much to the sharp growth in tradeable financial
services in large institutions in the City of London. Healthcare, chiefly
the National Health Service, was the next biggest identifiable sub-sector,
accounting for jobs growth of a further 500,000. Only in the next
fastest-growing sector - hotels and catering  - which added 390,000 jobs,
did the small business sector make a significant contribution through
family-owned hotels and restaurants.
This looks paltry when compared with the US, even allowing for the fact that
the US economy is six or seven times bigger at today's exchange rates.
There, new start-ups alone created 12m jobs in the 1980s and the service
sector produced 20m jobs overall. In continental Europe, small business has
long been more vibrant than in the UK. The Mittelstand, Germany's small to
medium-sized business sector, is the backbone of its tradeable goods sector.
Private Italian family business is a principal component in Italy's export
success. It seems probable that in Britain in the 1990s the banking
constraint is squeezing a sector that remains weak by the standards of the
rest of the developed world. What can be done to mitigate the damage?
The obvious immediate remedy is to follow the US precedent, whereby the
Federal Reserve has helped restore the profitability of the banking system
by encouraging banks to expand their holdings of government bonds. If the
yield curve is reasonably steep, with a large gap between short-term money
market rates and longer-term bond rates, banks can borrow cheaply and invest
profitably in Treasury paper at a higher rate. This has already put much of
the US banking system back on its feet and helped restore bank capital.
The trouble with this approach in Britain is that the yield curve is not as
steep as the banks might wish and the risks are higher. The US banks are
borrowing short and lending to the government a little longer. This, in
bankerly argot, constitutes maturity transformation: the mismatching of the
respective maturities of assets and liabilities. If short-term interest
rates rise unexpectedly, the banks would incur losses.
The risk has not been great in the US because the Fed clearly indicated that
the enhancement of bank profits was an implicit goal of its monetary policy.
But in Britain the Bank of England, unlike its US counterpart, regards the
government's own debt as carrying an element of risk for the purposes of
calculating bank capital ratios. And not without justice, particularly
today, when monetary policy is in such a muddle. Conflicting signals emerge
from Number 10 Downing Street, the Treasury and the Bank of England, and the
markets show the utmost scepticism about all official pronouncements.
As yet the banks and building societies still hold only 6 per cent of the
outstanding stock in the gilts market. While the figure seems likely to
rise, it will probably take significantly lower short-term rates to make the
yield curve look more tempting to the banks. Even then, it seems unlikely
that British bank holdings of government paper will approach US levels
because the risks are simply too high. It follows that other approaches will
need to be explored.
Mr Pearse of Midland Bank has put forward a thoughtful agenda, which
includes proposals for reducing small companies' overdependence on
short-term debt and encouraging the provision of more equity capital to
small business. It is hard to quarrel with either point. As the chart shows,
the financial problem for British businesses is not that balance sheets are
overburdened with debt. British companies borrow less than most - although
the government's loan guarantee scheme has encouraged smaller businesses to
overborrow. The trouble is that, whenever a promising generation of
businesses emerges, an exaggerated boom-bust cycle always wipes out the
potential equivalent of Germany's Mittelstand.
All history suggests that the only sensible way to make financial plans for
a small business in Britain is to assume that, when Mr Major next reshuffles
his cabinet, he will find a worthy successor to Maudling, Barber and Lawson
to embark on yet another dash for growth, and that the next grinding change
of monetary gear will take place in the second half of the 1990s. Against
such a background, overdraft finance leaves businesses too vulnerable to
panicky bankers. Hence the case for longer-term financing. Equity, meantime,
provides a cushion against monetary volatility.
The snag is that small business entrepreneurs are notoriously reluctant to
permit outside interference in their business and equally unhappy to cede
any degree of control over the equity capital. So it will take a big change
in small business attitudes, as well as a change in financing habits, to
deal with this Achilles' heel of the British economy. A stable monetary
environment would be infinitely preferable to a panoply of government loan
schemes, fiscal incentives for equity investment and the rest. But Britain's
remaining small businesses will doubtless feel, by now, that such stability
is too much to hope for.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Man in the news: Long arm of the computer - Antonio Di
Pietro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Italy, the country that nurtured Machiavelli, nothing is taken at face
value. A conspiracy theory is always the preferred explanation.
Sooner or later, the corruption scandals now enveloping Italy's political
and business elite were likely to be seen in a conspiratorial context. The
most fanciful theory is that a CIA plot to undermine the European
Community's efforts to forge closer ties has started in Italy, the weakest
of its 12 member states.
This week Mr Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist leader who wants to prevent
parliament from waiving his immunity to face corruption charges, came up
with his own theory. He claimed that magistrates in Milan were investigating
him as part of a co-ordinated plan to decapitate his party's influence. He
insisted one set of magistrates, headed by his main accuser, Mr Antonio Di
Pietro, was part of a Catholic reform group with links to the grand master
of Italian manipulation, Giulio Andreotti, the Christain Democrat who served
as premier seven times. Another set, Mr Craxi claimed, was linked to
sympathisers in the former Communist party, now the party of the Democratic
Left (PDS).
Mr Craxi, with some justification, may feel he is being made the principal
scapegoat for a profoundly corrupt politico-economic system. But it is
self-seeking to regard the Milan magistrates, and Mr Di Pietro in
particular, as conspirators. The circumstances of the investigation and the
credentials of magistrates such as Mr Di Pietro suggest the widening
corruption scandal is not the result of a conspiracy - international or
otherwise - but rather the product of good police work, new investigative
methods, the failures of the postwar political establishment and a growing
public consensus against the corruption.
Those familiar with the investigation are convinced the magistrates are
inspired by a determination to clean up political wrongdoing. 'Rather than
punish individuals, they want to end an entire system that has dominated
Italian life,' says Mr Roberto Mongini, a Christian Democrat lawyer in Milan
who was one of the first to confess to accepting bribes.
Di Pietro's origins are outside of that system; he is not a typical
magistrate, many of whom owe their careers to political patrons. Born in
1950, he comes from the humble agricultural world of southern Italy. He
joined the police force after doing a seven-month stint in Germany as a
'guest worker' in a factory. He graduated into the judiciary, becoming in
the mid-1980s a Milan magistrate, whose role is essentially that of a
detective preparing evidence for prosecution.
His first big case was to break a driving licence scam which had been
ignored because no one had been able to knit together the complex threads of
the case. He noticed from police reports of trucking accidents that many of
the drivers had obtained licences from a handful of driving schools. On
investigation, one school was found to have passed 10,000 drivers in a year.
The documentation was voluminous so the magistrate had to learn how to use
computers. In one of several books just published about Di Pietro, he says
he fed in 30m pieces of data onto floppy discs to break the case. Though
computer cross-referencing and solid detective work, 125 people, mainly
driving-school owners and officials in the Milan vehicle-licensing
department were brought before the courts. Only 11 were acquitted.
This gave Di Pietro a taste of how the computer could revolutionise
investigative work. His computer expertise subsequently led him to be called
in to solve a case of hacking at Milan University. But according to a
colleague, the case also gave him insight into how corruption was working at
all levels of Milan society. 'If it happened with driving licences, surely
it was happening with everything else.'
The computer programme for breaking the driving licence case was code-named
Perseus, after the mythical hero who cut off the Medusa's head. But Di
Pietro discovered how corrupton had spread when, in 1988, he investigated a
bribery scandal in the purchasing department of a Milan municipal transport
company, ATM. This involved the payment of up to 5 per cent commission on
orders, the sums being agreed between transport officials - whose jobs were
owed to the main political parties - and the suppliers. The accused were
brought to trial in 1991.
By this time, Di Pietro and fellow magistrates had acquired a formidable
computerised dossier of suspect officials, politicians and contractors.
Early last year, when a small contractor complained to the police that he
was being asked to pay a 10 per cent bribe on a cleaning contract by Mr
Mario Chiesa, the Socialist head of an old people's home, a trap was set.
Chiesa was already on the files, as were some of his associates.
Since then, the investigation has snowballed, largely on the strength of
computer-based information. Some of the main leads have come by breaking the
codes in floppy discs confiscated from arrested politicians, officials and
businessman. This vast accumulation of data has also had an intimidating
effect; it has persuaded many of those under investigation to co-operate.
But Di Pietro has also proved a 'good cop' in the traditional sense,
cleverly assessing the psychology of those accused. 'He's a magistrate I
would wish no one to find themselves in front of,' says Mr Mongini, who
confessed after being interrogated by the magistrate.
Indeed, an important feature of the recent scandals is the number of people
who have admitted their involvement. As the magistrates do not hesitate to
resort to preventive detention in prison to make people talk, more and more
are coming forward to cut bargains with the law - especially businessmen who
have paid the bribes.
Thus the magistrates have been able to break the omerta - the law of silence
 -which businessmen and politicians have observed in postwar Italy while
operating a system of bribes and corruption which everyone tolerated. But Di
Pietro and his fellow magistrates only bring cases to the courts. The
growing political debate over possible pardons for the offenders is out of
their hands.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Bull Ring redevelopment clears regulatory barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE last significant regulatory barrier to the redevelopment of the Bull
Ring, the most conspicuous and inhospitable example of Birmingham's 1960s
city centre building programme, fell yesterday.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, gave authority for compulsory land
purchases to make possible the assembly of a 26-acre site to create a
shopping and business complex. The Rotunda office tower, which has glowered
over Birmingham's skyline for a generation, will be demolished.
London &amp; Edinburgh Trust, the Swedish-owned property group that owns the
Bull Ring, will start detailed discussions with Birmingham City Council
about design and construction of a new complex, for which outline planning
permission was granted in 1990.
Noting that it had taken six years to complete the planning process, the
trust said: 'It will take at least as long with a following wind to realise
the scheme itself.' The City Council said the scheme has 'got to wait until
the economic climate is right'.
The redevelopment will cost about Pounds 500m and LET has to put financing
in place. It also has to find tenants for the two department stores included
in the 1m sq ft shopping complex and for the new 300,000 sq ft of office
space based on a tower replacing the Rotunda. The Bull Ring, with its
angular concrete and bleak subways, is a longstanding butt of criticism.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Go-ahead for Pounds 200m Manchester retail plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, CHRIS TIGHE and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 200m scheme for one of the largest out-of-town shopping centres in
the UK yesterday won planning permission from Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary.
The 300-acre Trafford Centre at Dumplington near Manchester, which will have
1m sq ft of shopping and sports facilities, will be the largest retail
project in the north-west of England.
The decision was greeted with dismay by local authorities, developers and
retailers who fear it will further increase already fierce competition, to
the detriment of the many shopping centres in the greater Manchester area.
Work on the centre is expected to begin within two years and is likely to be
completed by 1997.
Property experts said it was likely that the centre would be the last large
shopping centre to win planning approval.
Very few property schemes have been initiated since the property market went
into decline three years ago but Mr Robert Hough, chairman of Manchester
Ship Canal Company, the developers of the site, is confident of attracting
finance and tenants. He said: 'It is a greenfield site, linked to three
motorways with a large conurbation on its doorstep. It will be a magnet into
the north-west.'
More than 7m people live within an hour's drive of the site which is bounded
by Trafford Park, the M63 and the Manchester Ship Canal.
Critics of the scheme said the decision appeared to cut across draft
planning guidelines issued by the government at the end of last year. These
favoured planning restraint for out-of-town shopping centres to protect
existing centres.
A consortium of eight of greater Manchester's 10 metropolitan district
councils and five large property developers, which oppose the proposal, is
considering whether to mount a High Court challenge.
Mr David Kaiserman, senior assistant city planning officer for Manchester
City Council, said: 'We see development of this type making it even more
difficult to achieve regeneration in the inner parts of the city. A large
peripheral development appealing only to people who have cars is not doing
anything at all in our view in net terms for urban regeneration.'
Mr David Brown, president of the Manchester Chamber of Trade and manager of
the city's Arndale Centre, said: 'Something like this will have an effect on
all levels of trade in the city of Manchester and other surrounding towns
and will inevitably lead to job losses in the city centre. It will affect
the big multiples and the small guys.'
Mr Brown said there was already a 'massive choice' of retail outlets in
Manchester and the 10 large towns in an outlying 10-mile radius.
The consortium opposed to the scheme includes P&amp;O, owners of Manchester's
Arndale Centre, MEPC, Land Securities, Norwich Union and Shudehill, a
company formed by the Co-operative Insurance Society and the Co-operative
Wholesale Society.
Shudehill has planning permission for a 500,000 sq ft retail development on
a site beside the Arndale Centre. Mr Kaiserman said Shudehill had indicated
it would have to reconsider its plan.
Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council, which covers Dumplington, welcomed
the decision to give the go-ahead for the centre.
Mr Michael Crawley, senior assistant director for plan-ning, said it would
contribute to regeneration at Trafford Park and complement rather than
adversely affect other centres.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Eight years of wrangling yield results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1985 Mr John Whittaker, now chairman of Peel Holdings, saw that the
potential of the Manchester Ship Canal owed more to its land along the canal
banks than its stevedoring operations at Ellesmere Port and Runcorn.
The 300 vacant acres of land at Dumplington, near Barton Lock, was the
jewel. More than 7m people lived within an hour's drive, making it perfect
for a retail and leisure centre.
Mr Whittaker spotted a weakness in the canal company's share structure.
There were 8m shares, split evenly between the ordinaries and the much less
valuable preference shares, but they carried equal voting rights.
He bought preference shares and in 1986 was forced to bid when his total
holding passed 30 per cent. By this time institutional investors had woken
up to the potential and the price of the ordinaries rocketed from Pounds 7
to about Pounds 18 each.
After months of struggle Mr Whittaker's stake passed 50 per cent and he took
control at an emotional meeting in 1987.
He immediately sacked the chairman, Mr Nicholas Berry, then chairman of
Harrap, the publisher, who had been brought in only months before to lead a
rearguard action against Mr Whittaker.
But Mr Whittaker did not have a majority of the ordinary shares and six
years of wrangling began.
The end of the 1980s property boom strained Mr Whittaker's personal
resources and forced him to transfer ownership of the canal from his private
family businesses to Peel Holdings, a quoted company.
He kept trying to buy out Mr Berry and his allies but, as property markets
faltered, could not manage their final price of Pounds 25 per share, plus a
bonus of Pounds 5 per share if the scheme for a retail centre at Dumplington
ever got planning consent.
Also in the way stood Regatta, a group of several rival property companies
which had similar land on the other side of the M63. Planning inquiries,
however, found for the Dumplington scheme, provided the canal company would
pay to widen Barton Bridge, a 1 1/2 -mile, high-level viaduct carrying six
lanes of the motorway over the canal. The Department of Transport felt the
retail centre would create a traffic bottleneck.
This was in 1991, but everything stalled because Salford, which owned the
land needed for the pillars that would carry the wider bridge, refused to
co-operate with the project.
The canal company retaliated by challenging the traffic assumptions on which
the bridge-widening order was based. By winning its argument planning
consent had to be given yesterday, nearly eight years after Mr Whittaker
entered the fray.
Mr Berry, minority shareholder in the company, said the decision vindicated
his patience.
He said it removed uncertainty about the shares' value and might prompt
further discussion between himself and Peel about the sale of his holding.
In the last month Peel raised its stake in the company to 82 per cent by
buying a 6 per cent stake from the British Coal pension fund.
The importance of planning permission to the company's value was
demonstrated by yesterday's Pounds 3.20 jump in the canal company shares to
Pounds 20 and a 31p rise in Peel's share price to 200p. In 1990 valuers
considered that the land, which has a book value of Pounds 15m, would be
worth an extra Pounds 35m with permission.

TRUSTEES of the Mirror Group Pension Fund yesterday announced the

440m was missing from the pension schemes of companies controlled by the

The arrangements will be available from the age of 56 to people who have
completed 25 years service. Those aged at least 60 will be allowed to
commute part of the pension for a lump sum.
Deferred pensioners who had at least 25 years service before they left the

FT  06 MAR 93 / Writ on NatWest chairman struck out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HIGH Court yesterday 'struck out' a writ issued by Mr George Mainz, a
businessman, against Lord Alexander, chairman of National Westminster Bank.
Mr Mainz, a frozen foods manufacturer, claimed Lord Alexander 'became party
to a bank conspiracy' and partook in his defamation. He claimed the bank
lost him Pounds 2m and cost him his business.
He said he had never received an explanation.
But after an hour-long private hearing High Court official Master Hodgson
ruled the writ showed no reasonable cause of action and was 'scandalous,
frivolous or vex-atious'.
The bank has denied Mr Mainz's allegations, which go back to 1966. Lord
Alexander was not present at the hear-ing.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Unions call for Birt to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BBC UNIONS yesterday called for the resignation of Mr John Birt, the BBC
director-general, and Mr Marmaduke Hussey, chairman of the corporation.
The demands were made at a meeting with BBC management and follow the
revelation that from 1987 until this week Mr Birt had been paid as a
freelance consultant through his private company, John Birt Productions.
At the meeting with Mrs Margaret Salmon, the BBC's director of personnel, Mr
Roger Bolton, the chief negotiator of Bectu, the broadcasting union, said
staff had been outraged by the damage caused to the corporation's reputation
by the revelation.
'The corporation has lost the moral authority it needs to report on news and
current affairs and deserves no respect from either press or politicians,'
Mr Bolton said.
The representatives from Bectu, the National Union and Journalists and the
AEEU electricians' union also asked the BBC to confirm that the corporation
provides Mr Birt with two cars, one chauffeur-driven and another for private
use, and that it also reimburses costs incurred when he attends public
functions.
The unions said Mrs Salmon had replied that she needed time to consider the
question.
The BBC had no comment to make on the views of the unions last night.

FT  06 MAR 93 / BA and Virgin continue brinkmanship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRINKMANSHIP between British Airways and Virgin Atlantic will continue
this weekend beyond the 'final' deadline set earlier this week by Mr Richard
Branson, the Virgin chairman.
Only hours before Mr Branson's deadline expired, BA presented a fresh set of
counter-proposals centred on its demands that Virgin be banned from ever
again exploiting the affair and a plan by BA to destroy court documents
referring to its campaign to undermine its competitor.
In spite of Mr Branson's warning that he would consider further legal action
against BA unless an agreement to end their 'dirty tricks' dispute was
reached yesterday, the two airlines have decided to make a last attempt to
seek a peace deal.
Given the sensitivity of the position, neither side last night was prepared
to shed light on the latest twists in the month-long negotiations. With both
sides within sight of agreement, however, another obstacle emerged last
night as lawyers began another round of talks.
Virgin is understood to have agreed to return to BA court documents, used
during its January libel hearing and detailing the UK flag carrier's covert
operations. But Virgin is insisting the records are held by lawyers until
normal relationships between the two airlines are resumed. Mr Branson is
concerned that the documents should be available for use if the airline
finds itself embroiled in any future legal action arising from the 'dirty
tricks' affair.
Although Mr Branson is understood to have originally asked for about Pounds
13m to cover commercial damages and to settle a long-running aircraft
maintenance dispute, he is ready to accept BA's cash offer of Pounds 9m. But
he has rejected signing a confidentiality clause demanded by BA as an
unreasonable attempt to gag him.
He has also insisted on BA signing a pledge never to indulge again in
anti-competitive behaviour.
Both sides still appear anxious to resolve the time-consuming and costly
dispute. In spite of the continuing tensions, they remain hopeful they can
finally resolve their differences by early next week.
During four weeks of often acrimonious and sometimes sterile negotiations
the two airlines have found grounds for compromise on several issues. These
include agreement on the use of airline computerised passenger reservation
information, and a code precluding any further poaching of customers.
BA is conducting an internal investigation into allegations that its
California-based operations have continued attempts to persuade Virgin
passengers to switch airlines.
Mr Branson, who is flying to the US tomorrow for three days, is involved in
complex talks with aircraft manufacturers to acquire new, widebody jets to
renew and expand his fleet.
Like BA's new management team, he regards the talks as a damaging
distraction from the business of running an airline in difficult market
conditions.
However, sources close to both sides acknowledged last night that the
principal issue keeping them apart and threatening to bring the talks down
remains the problem of securing an agreement on confidentiality.
In spite of a series of false deadlines both sides accept that failure to
agree by early next week could lead to a breakdown of talks which, in turn,
might open up prolonged legal action in Europe and the US.

FT  06 MAR 93 / The Conservative Central Council at Harrogate: One friend
for Norman Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN Lamont has at least one friend among the 800 to 900 Tory activists
gathered in Harrogate.
As political gossip was traded on the fringes of the Conservative central
council a London representative vigorously asserted that the chancellor
should remain in his post until 1995, and then become foreign secretary.
It was not a popular stance. 'It wouldn't matter if he could walk on water
now,' was how another south-east Tory summed up the mood that sees the early
departure of Mr Lamont as the starting point for the expected summer
reshuffle.
There was less unity about his successor. The well-trailed names of Mr
Michael Portillo, Mr John MacGregor, Sir Norman Fowler and Mr Kenneth Clarke
were mentioned. A lone voice even suggested that Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, could be chancellor.
Central council meetings tend to comprise people hardened by years of
service to the party, so it is no surprise that they routinely deny standing
ovations to speeches that would get the annual party conference on its feet.
Even so, the atmosphere in the Royal Hall, as ministers chorused the need to
get on with ratifying Maastricht, was subdued.
The representatives are not rampantly Euro-sceptic - indeed, some of them
say British businesses would suffer if the UK does not ratify - but many
expressed the feeling that Maastricht is irrelevant and has distracted the
government from what really matters - economic recovery.
So while they applauded, as Tories always applaud, the call for MPs to show
some loyalty to the party and those who worked so hard to get them elected,
there was little sign that unless they are pushed, the grassroots are
threatening to deselect persistent rebels as the party's managers have been
hinting. 'The Wintertons are adored in Cheshire,' said one representative -
albeit not from Cheshire - of two of the most incorrigible Tory MPs.

FT  06 MAR 93 / The Conservative Central Council at Harrogate: Grassroots
rebels defeat party reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RARE grassroots rebellion among Tory activists succeeded yesterday in
defeating plans to revamp the party organisation, after bitter wrangling in
a discussion behind closed doors.
Party managers had hoped to keep the row private and under control by
excluding the press from the debate on the rule changes, which critics said
would make the organisation too centralised.
In four secret ballots enough representatives rejected the advice of Sir
Basil Feldman, chairman of the voluntary wing of the party, to throw out the
planned changes, which needed a majority of two thirds.
After the debate, Sir Basil played down the defeats. He said he was sure
many constituencies would still want to abide by the proposed code of
practice and would submit annual financial returns to party headquarters,
even though the rule change forcing local associations to do so had not gone
through. Representatives made it clear they wanted an annual statement of
the party's accounts.
But activists stopped short of approving a motion censuring the party
organisation for failing to respond to demands for greater accountability,
and calling for direct elections to the new board of management set in place
by Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman.
Party managers were so worried about how that debate might go that they made
a last-minute decision to hold it in private too. The defeat for the party
management does not affect the reforms at Tory central office proposed by
Sir Norman. He said yesterday the new board of management would act like a
company's board of directors, and take the most significant financial
decisions.
The board will comprise representatives of different parts of the party,
such as MPs and councillors. Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman of Grand
Metropolitan, will serve as a non-executive director.
Sir Norman, responding to grassroots concern about the state of the party's
finances, said spending had been cut from Pounds 12m a year to Pounds 7m a
year, and promised the board of management would prevent severe
over-spending in future.
'Pro-democracy' campaigners in the Tory party had warned that the party's
need to raise more money might lead the central organisation to try to gain
control of constituency party assets. Sir Norman denied the suggestion.

FT  06 MAR 93 / The Conservative Central Council at Harrogate: Fears on pit
jobs temper optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine yesterday coupled a confident prediction that the
economy has reached a turning point with a stark warning that the
government's review of pit closures will not prevent further heavy job
losses in the coal industry.
In a generally upbeat speech to Tory party activists at Harrogate, the trade
and industry secretary led a co-ordinated effort by ministers to 'talk up'
economic recovery.
Pointing to record levels on the stock market, rising confidence among
business leaders and a surge in British productivity relative to its
overseas rivals, he told the conference that new opportunities were 'daily
more evident'.
Mr Heseltine said that the government was offering positive help to
manufacturing industry through increased export credits, higher capital
allowances and a renewed deregulation drive.
His speech - which coincided with an assurance by Mr Douglas Hurd, the
foreign secretary, that with the worst of the recession behind it Britain
could now look 'confidently ahead' - underlined the government's
determination to try to underpin business and consumer confidence.
But Mr Heseltine's upbeat tone did not extend to the conclusions of the coal
review later this month.
In a reference to his tough negotiations with the power generators he told
that conference: 'I cannot make people buy coal. This is a free society.'
Warning of the impact of any rescue plan on the nuclear and gas industries,
he added: 'There are no cost-free options. A job saved in one industry can
too easily be a job lost in another.'

FT  06 MAR 93 / NCP denies wanting to damage rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPERATION to spy on Europarks, a business rival of National Car Parks,
to obtain confidential details of its finances was never intended to damage
the company, the Old Bailey was told yesterday.
The objective of the operation by KAS, the private security company, was to
discover whether Europarks won business using improper methods, Mr Jeremy
Roberts QC, for Mr Simon Hewitt, a former KAS manager, said.
The company's trading position was never harmed, even though Mr Gordon
Layton, the NCP chief executive who ordered the operation, was in a position
to do this, he said.
Mr Roberts admitted that KAS had an arrogant mentality, which included
thinking its staff could break the law. But Mr Hewitt took his instructions
from superiors who included Sir David Stirling, the former head of the SAS.
Mr Hewitt and Mr Layton both deny conspiring to defraud Europarks. The trial
continues on Monday.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Police work to be rated in league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to publish league tables comparing the performance of
police forces in England and Wales, Mr Kenneth Clarke, the home secretary,
said yesterday.
The tables will be based on 17 performance indicators, which will be
published for the first time in December 1994.
The indicators will include detection rates for different crimes, the
percentage of urgent incidents responded to within target times, the speed
of response to 999 calls and the number of officers available for duty.
The indicators have been devised by the Audit Commission, the
public-spending watchdog, with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary
and the Association of Chief Police Officers.
Mr Clarke accepted that the scores achieved by a police force might not
always reflect its actual performance. He said it would be misleading to
compare crime detection rates in rural Wales with those in greater
Manchester, where many more offences took place.
'I do not think, however, that the ranking of police forces in a league
table showing how they compare against one another should be put off the
agenda for that reason alone,' he said.
The home secretary expected the publication of indicators to 'excite public
debate'. The publication of league tables of test results for
seven-year-olds had been hugely popular and became 'a minor industry'.
Mr Tony Blair, Labour's shadow home secretary, said it was important that
the public had as much information as possible. He added: 'But we should not
kid ourselves that the publication of information about policing is a
substitute for a proper or coherent policy to fight crime - which is
woefully lacking at present.
'We must get policing back into local communities so that we get the
appalling level of crime down.'

FT  06 MAR 93 / The Conservative Central Council at Harrogate: Tories play
the loyalty card
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservatives yesterday launched a new test of party loyalty by
following Labour and the Liberal Democrats in putting the party's name to a
credit card. The cash-strapped party hopes members will cut its debts by
using their cards to pay bills.
The party is launching an 'affinity' card backed by the Royal Bank of
Scotland. Like the Labour and Liberal Democrat cards, both backed by the
Co-operative Bank, it will cost members Pounds 10 a year.
Under the affinity card scheme, the linked political party or charity
receives a payment for each account opened, plus an annual sum based on
cardholders' use of the card.
Banks that back such cards have found their success depends on how tied
members feel to the cause. Royal Bank of Scotland runs affinity cards for
four groups, including the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the Woodland
Trust and the National Canine Defence League. The bank says its RNLI card
has been the most successful because many yacht and boat club members
support the lifeboat cause.

THE BRITISH drank less cognac but more wine last year. Cognac sales fell

but Britain remained the leading European market, ahead of Germany and

Britain's wine consumption - up from 3.7 litres to nearly 13 litres a head
since 1970 - is growing faster than in any other European country. About
577m litres of wine, worth more than Pounds 4bn, was consumed last year,

A LAWYER who used 'a mire of deception' to plunder clients' accounts and
cheat financial institutions of Pounds 4.7m was jailed for a total of seven
years at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.
Mr Mark Wyeth, prosecuting, said Mr Philip Englefield, 49, of Knightsbridge,
west London, had joined the 142-year-old west London firm of Boyce, Evans
and Sheppard 32 years ago, eventually becoming a senior partner.
Mr Englefield had stolen or misappropriated money from clients, lending to
fund speculative property ventures. 'He lied to his clients and misled his
fellow partners.'
Mr Englefield admitted 10 charges involving theft, false accounting and
procuring the execution of valuable securities. His activities were
uncovered when the firm computerised its clients' accounts.

A FOUR-WEEK strike at the Yarrow warship yard in Glasgow ended yesterday
when the 1,300 hourly-paid workers voted by a four-to-one majority to return
to work.
The workers accepted a two-year pay-and-conditions offer which they had
turned down a week ago and which represented only a marginal improvement on
the offer which was available when they went on strike on February 5.
Yarrow, a subsidiary of GEC, had offered a 3.78 per cent pay increase over

abolition of the Friday tea break - as well as an immediate one-off payment
of Pounds 300.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Bass drops out of lottery race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the brewing, hotels and leisure group, has dropped out of the running
for the licence to operate the planned National Lottery, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
The company had examined in detail prospects for the National Lottery - the
lottery bill is now going through parliament - and was expected to be a
member of a consortium bidding for the operating licence.
After a strategic review of the company's operations, the Bass board decided
last week to concentrate on its existing core businesses and disband its
lottery team, which had reviewed opportunities.
The Bass decision has been taken even though the company is already involved
in gambling through Coral, its bookmaking arm.
The company decided that operating the National Lottery would be an entirely
separate business needing new skills.
'We think the National Lottery will be a great success but we have decided
to concentrate on our existing business,' Bass said yesterday.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Smith calls for Leyland Daf help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, yesterday challenged Mr John Major, the
prime minister, to demonstrate his commitment to Britain's manufacturing
sector by ensuring a future for Leyland Daf.
He contrasted the moves by the Dutch government to preserve as much as
possible of the company's plants in the Netherlands with the insistence of
British ministers that the receiver should be left to decide what could be
salvaged.
Mr Smith told the north-west regional conference of the Labour party in
Blackpool that the Dutch government had been willing to invest in the
company because it recognised the value to the economy of its technology and
the skills of its workforce. Dutch workers knew their plants were secure,
while British workers still did not know what would become of them, he said.
A planned demonstration tomorrow to protest against alleged government
refusal to help Leyland Daf was understood to have been called off last
night after being attacked as 'ill-conceived' and a 'cheap trick' by the
Leyland Daf dealers' association.
Both the administrative receivers of Leyland Daf, and management teams
staging separate buy-out attempts for the vans operation in Birmingham and
truck plant at Leyland, Lancashire, are understood to have been dismayed and
irritated by the planned protest and a poster campaign which sprang up
yesterday throughout the UK.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Tougher investor protection urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SELF-REGULATION of the financial services industry has failed the consumer
and should be replaced by a statutory Office of Investor Protection, the
Consumers' Association said yesterday.
The group, in a review of the six-year-old Financial Services Act, said the
present system was 'far too deeply flawed' to be remedied easily and the
entire act should be scrapped.
While acknowledging that the act had made some improvements in protecting
investors, particularly in the provision of a compensation scheme for those
who suffered losses, it said there were far more shortcomings.
The association, a voluntary organisation with more than 800,000 members,
said: 'There is considerable evidence that the regulatory system has
delivered inadequate standards of monitoring and enforcement, resulting in
unacceptably high levels of fraud and widespread mis-selling.'
The association estimated that the annual loss to consumers in the first
year of contracts being signed was about Pounds 250m. Charges are deducted
in the first few years of a policy's life. As a result those who surrender
early lose most or all of their premium payments.
The association said the Financial Services Act, which allows many
businesses to choose between several self-regulatory bodies, had created
'regulatory arbitrage', allowing large integrated groups to shop around for
the most sympathetic regulator.
In citing evidence of widespread mis-selling, the association noted that
during the 1988-89 tax year, personal pensions were sold to 63,000 women
with no earnings who did not even qualify for such plans.
The association recommended that a regulator be established similar to those
overseeing public utilities.
