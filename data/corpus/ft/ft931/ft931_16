FT  06 MAR 93 / Promised Glasgow army jobs in jeopardy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLASGOW is to continue fighting to persuade the army to locate its new
personnel centre in the city, creating 700 jobs, after Mr Archie Hamilton,
the armed forces minister, confirmed that the army was considering an
alternative site in Stockport, near Manchester.
Amid accusations from Scottish politicians of all parties that the
government was reneging on a decision made only six weeks ago, Mr Hamilton
said the ministry had only recently become aware of a existence of a
suitable building in Stockport which would cost Pounds 4m against Pounds 20m
for the one earmarked in Glasgow.
He indicated that it was likely that the army would settle for Stockport,
although the recommendation was still subject to review. It was important
that the taxpayer received value for money.
In January the army said it was recommending Glasgow as the site of its new
unified personnel centre to handle all army pay and pensions. It said it
would lead to the closure of several smaller offices around Britain, but 700
new jobs would be created in Glasgow and 400 existing MoD jobs in the city
would be safeguarded.
It was expected that the centre would be located in Tay House, a large new
office building standing empty in the heart of the city.
Mr Hamilton said the ministry had always made clear that the original
recommendation was subject to a period of review. During that period the
ministry's consultants had become aware of a suitable vacant building in
Stockport. which they had not known about.
The decision to give Stockport serious consideration has infuriated Mr Ian
Lang, the Scottish secretary, who next week will announce the government's
plans for improved constitutional arrangements for Scotland, which are
widely expected not to satisfy the opposition parties.
The Glasgow development agency, which was helping the army find a location
for its new centre, said yesterday it had offered the army several
buildings, some of which were cheaper than the one eventually chosen. 'We
were always told that they wanted a modern building to take them into the
21st century,' the agency said yesterday.
It believes that the Pounds 4m building in Stockport is a 1970s structure.
'We will go back and make our submission all over again,' the agency said.
Meanwhile there were indications yesterday that the government will next
week announce the transfer of some of the civil servants concerned with
regulating the North Sea oil industry from London to Aberdeen. But the
proposed transfer appeared to amount to less than that urged by Scottish
politicians.
Mr Bob Middleton, convener of Grampian regional council, which includes
Aberdeen, said he understood that a cabinet committee had agreed on Thursday
that between 30 and 40 civil servants' posts would be moved from London to
Aberdeen.
That is fewer than the 80-odd civil servants in the petroleum engineering
division of the Department of Trade and Industry's energy section, whose
transfer to Aberdeen has long been a demand of businessmen and politicians
in north-east Scotland.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Lord Ridley: Firebrand champion and defender of the
Thatcherite faith - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD RIDLEY of Liddesdale, the zealous promoter of Thatcherism who died
yesterday, was lauded by Baroness Thatcher, former prime minister, as 'a
great Englishman'.
He would have been equally honoured, perhaps privately, to have been called
a bad European.
The former secretary of state for transport, environment, and trade and
industry as well as intellectual confidant of Mrs Margaret Thatcher - as she
was then - was a nationalist, bogey man of Brussels and scourge of
socialism. His vision was of a wider, looser free-market Europe.
He was an unrepentant opponent of Maastricht who staggered into the House of
Lords on his 64th birthday two weeks ago for a last denouncement of the
treaty and European integration. A heavy smoker, he had been ill for some
months.
As Mr Nicholas Ridley, his ministerial career ended in 1990 when he dubbed
the European Community 'a German racket designed to take over the whole of
Europe'.
The loss is greatest for the defenders of the Thatcherite legacy. His stamp
is indelible. But in his unbridled enthusiasm he also sowed some of the
seeds of its eventual destruction. There was an academic rigour but, unlike
Mrs Thatcher, he had less of an appreciation of the need to bow or bend
sometimes according to prevailing political practicalities.
Lord Ridley introduced the poll tax, attacking its detractors by saying:
'Why should a duke pay more than a dustman?' He arrived at the Department of
Trade and Industry to ask: 'What is this department for?' Prior to Mrs
Thatcher's election as prime minister in 1979 he plotted ways of taking on
the coal-miners.
He steered through the privatisation of British Airways and the water
industry. He represented the constituency of Cirencester and Tewkesbury for
more than 30 years until he retired at the April 1992 election.
For Mr John Major he was no close friend. When both were in the cabinet  -
the prime minister was then chancellor - Mr Ridley waged a relentless, but
ultimately unsuccessful, battle against British membership of the exchange
rate mechanism.
In typical maverick form Lord Ridley used a last article for The Times on
Wednesday to suggest a higher 50p rate of income tax and the abolition of
the ceiling on National Insurance contributions - strikingly close to Labour
party policies at the last election.
It was magnanimous of the prime minister to describe Lord Ridley yesterday
as inspiring 'great affection among those who worked closely with him'. Sir
Norman Fowler, Conservative party chairman whose views on Europe are
strictly Majorite, described him as 'one of the big characters in British
politics'.
Lord Ridley was a more complex character than the brash image he appeared to
cultivate. He could be personally unpleasant - particularly to journalists.
He had an arrogance perhaps borne of long experience.
On the Tory benches there were admirers more than friends. He was a bruiser
 -albeit with more grace than Lord Tebbit, the former party chairman who has
also joined the anti-Maastricht crusade.
But in private there was a different character. Civil servants liked his
wit, decisiveness and ability to delegate. He was a tall, gaunt character
with a sense of propriety. He regarded it as his duty in the Commons to take
the flak - as he did in generous quantities over, say, his refusal to act
against the Fayed brothers after a damning DTI report on their takeover of
Harrods.
An amateur artist, Lord Ridley liked to paint in bright colours. In the
world of politics he was similarly bold, sometimes betraying a naive
understanding of political correctness. His comments on Germany and the
European Community, in a Spectator magazine interview, were only the most
blatant example.
He missed life in political office, and pined for the Thatcher years, but
could at least claim that he went down fighting.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Spring Budget: Green taxes lose their pre-Budget lustre -
Why environmental levies have fallen off the government's agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE oil industry is bracing itself for rises in petrol and diesel taxes in
the chancellor's Budget on March 16, but otherwise environmental policy is
likely to be notable by its absence. That is in spite of the fondness of Mr
Michael Howard, environment secretary, for using financial instruments to
achieve environmental targets.
Tax rises for automotive fuel might be presented as environmental
instruments as transport emissions are the fastest-rising cause of air
pollution, but the more important motive is likely to be raising revenue.
When the chancellor completed the abolition of the 10 per cent special car
tax in the Autumn Statement he hinted that steps would be taken in the
Budget to recoup the money.
The thrust of recent transport policy - that move, combined with intense
debate about road pricing - has been to tax use of vehicles rather than
ownership. It would seem more likely that the government would raise the tax
on petrol and diesel rather than the vehicle excise duty.
Abolition of the special car tax will cost Pounds 1.5bn in a full year,
according to the Treasury. To recoup that an increase of 3.3 pence per litre
on automotive fuels would be needed, oil industry estimates show.
The question fuel companies are asking is whether the chancellor would go
further - several say privately they are braced for a rise of at least 5
pence per litre.
It is difficult to portray this as an environmental measure - even though
the Department of the Environment will doubtless try - because vehicle fuel
price rises have little impact on how much people use their vehicles. That
characteristic - increasing the attractiveness of a tax increase to the
Treasury - was demonstrated during the 1973 oil price rises, according to Mr
David Parker of the Petroleum Industry Association, although drivers
gradually moved to more fuel-efficient vehicles.
The much-discussed carbon or energy tax to help combat global warming is
unlikely to make an appearance in the Budget, in spite of the Clinton
administration's introduction of a US energy tax.
Mr Robert Jones, chairman of the Commons environment committee, has argued
that a carbon tax - intended to persuade the energy sector to move to less
carbon-intensive fuels, such as gas and nuclear fuels - would be pointless
if the government were to subsidise the coal industry.
Carbon or energy taxes in the UK are likely only as part of an EC-wide move
to reduce the impact on competitiveness, and Mr Ioannis Paleokrassas, the
new EC environment commissioner, has warned there is unlikely to be much
progress this year.
Labour may welcome caution in devising such taxes as it is concerned about
the impact on poorer families. Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment secretary,
said: 'We hope that they will carefully consider all the possible social
effects before moving ahead.'
The government is also likely to think that the introduction of a levy on
landfills - licensed rubbish dumps - would be premature. Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
the consultancy, has just completed a preliminary study for the environment
department on a levy designed to encourage incineration of waste and to a
lesser extent recycling.
Mr Smith says the UK government and Brussels are less serious about
environmental policy than they were several years ago.
The Budget is likely to strengthen the opinion that environmental policy is
fighting for its place on the political agenda.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Lawyer jailed for seven years
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A LAWYER who used 'a mire of deception' to plunder clients' accounts and
cheat financial institutions of Pounds 4.7m was jailed for a total of seven
years at Southwark Crown Court yesterday.
Mr Mark Wyeth, prosecuting, said Mr Philip Englefield, 49, of Knightsbridge,
west London, had joined the 142-year-old west London firm of Boyce, Evans
and Sheppard 32 years ago, eventually becoming a senior partner.
Mr Wyeth said Mr Englefield had stolen or misappropriated money from
clients, lending to fund speculative property ventures. 'He lied to his
clients and misled his fellow partners.'
Mr Englefield admitted 10 charges involving theft, false accounting and
procuring the execution of valuable securities.
His activities were uncovered when the firm computerised its clients'
accounts. Mr Englefield was now bankrupt and had been struck off by the Law
Society, the court heard.
The firm's reputation had suffered, said Mr Wyeth, and it had lost a lot of
business. It had changed name, moved to cheaper premises and shed three
quarters of its staff.
He added that as a result of Mr Englefield's criminal activities and alleged
separate frauds by another of the firm's partners, claims totalling Pounds
18m had been filed with the Solicitors' Indemnity Fund and Pounds 2m had
been paid in settlements.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Yarrow shipyard workers end strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FOUR-WEEK strike at the Yarrow warship yard in Glasgow ended yesterday
when the 1,300 hourly-paid workers voted by a four-to-one majority to return
to work, James Buxton writes.
The workers accepted a two-year pay-and-conditions offer which they had
turned down a week ago and which represented only a marginal improvement on
the offer which was available when they went on strike on February 5.
Yarrow, a subsidiary of GEC, had offered the workers a 3.78 per cent pay
increase over 12 months in return for changes in working conditions  -
including the abolition of the Friday tea break - as well as an immediate
one-off payment of Pounds 300.
The only concession the Yarrow management made was to make the pay increase
payable from March 1 instead of July 1. This was rejected by the workers
last week. Throughout the dispute union officials have urged them to accept
the terms on offer.
Yesterday Mr John Carty, Glasgow secretary for the AEEU engineering union,
said: 'At the end of the day improvements were achieved in the offer and the
workers have a right to feel proud they are going back united.'

FT  06 MAR 93 / Ten more judges for High Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD Mackay, the lord chancellor, is to recommend the appointment of 10 new
High Court judges 'as soon as possible' to tackle a growing backlog of
cases.
In a written answer in the Commons, Mr John Taylor, junior minister at the
Lord Chancellor's Department, said Lord Mackay's decision followed a report
by a group of judges and officials headed by Lord Justice Kennedy, on the
work, deployment and numbers of High Court judges.
Lord Taylor, lord chief justice, appointed last year with a mandate to
modernise the judiciary, said recently he could not do the job without a big
rise in the number of Appeal Court and High Court judges.
The government's announcement follows warnings from the legal profession
that a shortage of judges in the Commercial Court threatens London's future
as a centre for handling international business disputes. The lord
chancellor will have to seek parliamentary and Privy Council approval for an
increase in the statutory maximum number of judges before any appointments
can be made. The present limit of 85 was set in 1987. The number of High
Court judges on March 1 this year was 83. The salary for a High Court judge
is Pounds 87,620.
Mr Taylor said the judges would be deployed 'to reduce delays and backlogs'
in the Chancery Division, the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, the
Employment Appeal Tribunal and the Commercial Court.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Watchdog chief pledges fraud probes: Local government under
scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUDIT Commission, the public-spending watchdog, is to investigate fraud
and corruption in local government following allegations about malpractice
on an 'unpre-cedented' scale in the south London borough of Lambeth.
Mr Andrew Foster, the new controller of the commission, said at a conference
yesterday to mark its 10th anniversary that the investigation would be
launched next month. A second study into the health service was likely to
follow.
Mr Foster said that the study would analyse the extent of corruption by
re-opening every case notified to the commission in the past three years.
The investigation would then identify steps to prevent fraud by improving
the audit process or financial management systems.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, immediately welcomed the
investigation. He promised to consider any recommendations for additional
powers for auditors or local authorities.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, said that corruption was 60
times greater in central government and quangos than in local government.
'For all its imperfections, open, accountable local government is the best
antidote to corruption,' he said.
In his first newspaper interview since becoming controller, Mr Foster told
the Financial Times that the commission had repeatedly tried to draw
attention to what was going on in Lambeth.
'In every year since the Audit Commission was founded, our auditors have
made public interest reports saying that Lambeth's finances were in a
totally unacceptable state,' he said.
Before legislation was passed last year the commission could only send its
reports to the Department of the Environment and the local authority
concerned. Now it can publicise failure to address audit concerns, and
intends to do so with vigour.
Meanwhile, Lambeth's auditor has been working closely with the council
leader and chief officer to help them put things right. Mr Foster, formerly
deputy chief executive of the NHS management executive, said he wanted to
put much more effort into working with clients to improve their systems.
'Government reforms in many public services are delegating budgets to local
managers and encouraging more entrepreneurial behaviour. The people now
handling public money are less experienced, and there's a chance of things
going wrong without a clear regulatory framework.'
Mr Foster said the emphasis on contracting-out and market-testing required
new approaches to public-sector management, since it introduced new
opportunities for corruption in the awarding of contracts.
'People brought up in one sort of public-service culture must adapt to a
very different market-oriented culture,' he said. 'It needs new procedures
to ensure that those handling public money remain publicly accountable for
it.'
Mr Foster hopes to extend the commission's activities beyond local
government and the health service to other public-sector organisations. He
believes that the approach developed by the commission could help add value
to other public services.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Bass quits National Lottery race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASS, the brewing, hotels and leisure group, has dropped out of the running
for the licence to operate the planned National Lottery.
The company had examined in detail prospects for the National Lottery - the
lottery bill is now going through parliament - and was expected to be a
member of a consortium bidding for the operating licence. After a strategic
review of the company's operations, the Bass board decided last week to
concentrate on its existing core businesses and disband its lottery team,
which had reviewed opportunities.
The Bass decision has been taken even though the company is already involved
in gambling through Coral, its bookmaking arm. Bass is also a large operator
in the bingo market. The company decided that operating the National Lottery
would be an entirely separate business needing new skills.
'We think the National Lottery will be a great success but we have decided
to concentrate on our existing business,' Bass said yesterday.
Bass is still interested in selling lottery tickets in its pubs although it
is not clear whether this will be possible under the rules. Many business
opportunities will arise out of the National Lottery, particularly for
companies that supply other lotteries around the world.
These include companies such as GTECH, which supplies computer-based lottery
systems in many parts of the world and printers such as Norton Opax of the
UK which supplies lottery tickers and instant scratch game cards.

<TEXT>
MORE ARRESTS were expected soon in connection with the bombing of New York's
World Trade Centre, which killed five people and injured more than 1,000.
Yesterday FBI agents carried out fresh raids for suspects and clues linked
to the bombing, but reports that three men arrested at a mosque yesterday on
charges of transporting a stolen car across state lines were linked to the
case could not be confirmed.
A second suspect was charged yesterday with assaulting an investigator and
obstructing justice. Mr Ibrahim Elgabrowny was ordered held without bail.
The second arrest in the case followed Thursday evening's charging of Mr
Mohammed Salameh, a Moslem fundamentalist who was detained as he tried to
retrieve Dollars 400 for a rented van alleged to have contained the bomb.
The rental agreement named him and gave his address.
Mr Salameh was charged with aiding and abetting the bombing and subsequent
fire and with transporting explosives across state lines. He was refused
bail. If convicted, he could receive a life sentence.
Details of the charge against Mr Salameh pointed to him as the builder of
the massive bomb that blasted a 100ft-wide-hole in an underground parking
garage at the centre. The complaint said tools and parts were found at an
apartment Mr Salameh used and that a police expert said they were evidence
of a 'bomb-maker'.
US District Judge Richard Owen ordered Mr Salameh to be held without bail.
Investigators are still looking for other suspects, and the FBI warned that
the investigation would probably continue for many months.
New York Governor Mario Cuomo yesterday asked Presi dent Bill Clinton to
declare New York a major disaster area, which would allow the city to get
federal funding to help clean up the rubble, install new security measures
at the centre's twin towers and counsel displaced workers.
The federal Small Business Administration has already declared the area an
economic disaster zone, thereby making business owners eligible for
low-interest loans.
In a letter to the president, Mr Cuomo estimated the costs of the bombing at
more than Dollars 700m. Officials at the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, which owns and operates the complex, believe the figures will be
even higher.

MULTI-PARTY negotiations resumed yesterday in South Africa after a
nine-month hiatus, but were immediately bogged down in disagreements between
the mainly Zulu Inkatha Freedom party and the government and the African
National Congress, writes Patti Waldmeir from Johannesburg.
Some 26 organisations gathered at a hall outside Johannesburg for the
conference, with participants ranged from the pro-apartheid white
Conservative party (CP) through traditional tribal leaders to the black
radical Pan Africanist Congress (PAC).
There was an immediate dispute over who should chair the talks, and over
where delegates should be seated. Inkatha, the mainly Zulu party, also
signalled problems ahead, saying it rejected an agreement between the ANC
and government calling for power-sharing.

RUSSIA, displaying a tough new attitude to creditors and neighbouring
states, said yesterday it would not pay back debts built up by the former
Soviet Union until creditors had agreed a big rescheduling deal, Reuter
reports from Moscow.
Mr Alexander Shokhin, the Russian prime minister told a news conference that
Russia was paying back loans offered to Moscow after the Soviet Union fell
apart in December 1991, but would not repay former Soviet debt until the
Paris Club of creditor states agreed to allow more time to pay.
A Paris Club deal has stalled amid bickering between Russia and Ukraine over
who should pay what. Arrears are mounting while Russia and its creditors
talk about what to do.
A press statement, amplifying Mr Shokhin's comments, said high debt payments
would force Russia to switch energy exports from CIS countries to western
states prepared to pay hard currency for oil and gas.

PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday promised to propose 'some innovative
solutions' for Russia's problems at his summit with President Boris Yeltsin,
to be held in Vancouver on April 3 and 4, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
Mr Clinton said that he planned far more than a 'get acquainted' meeting. 'I
don't want to make any sweeping commitments but I'm going there with the
intention of trying to more aggressively engage the US in the economic and
political revitalisation of Russia.'
Vancouver was chosen over Warsaw, offered as a site by President Lech
Walesa, because Mr Yeltsin will be travelling in the Russian far east
immediately beforehand.
The administration has already proposed increasing bilateral assistance to
Russia from Dollars 400m (Pounds 281m) to Dollars 700m but Mr Clinton almost
certainly has a more ambitious agenda involving the US leading the main
industrialised countries in a bigger, more concerted Russian assistance
programme.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Militants' warning to foreigners in Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MILITANT Islamic group claiming to be behind recent attacks on tourists in
Egypt yesterday warned foreigners to leave the country and said foreign
investments 'could soon become a target.'
The warning was issued to the BBC in Cairo and in it the Gama'a
al-Islamiyya, or Islamic groups, also claimed responsibility for the killing
on Thursday of a police officer and his son in Upper Egypt. Diplomats in
Cairo said they were 'looking into' the warning, but were treating it with
circumspection.
Groups claiming to be part of the Gama'a al-Islamiyya regularly send faxes
to news organisations to claim or disclaim responsibility for violent
incidents in Egypt. Similar warnings were issued by these groups before the
spate of attacks on tourists, which began last summer.
The Gama'a al-Islamiyya claims to be behind the attacks on tourists in Cairo
and Upper Egypt which have already claimed the lives of at least three
foreign visitors and an Egyptian.
The most serious was the bombing last Friday of a crowded coffee-house in
central Cairo in which a Swedish and a Turkish tourist were killed, along
with one Egyptian.
In yesterday's warning, the Gama'a Islamiyya said it 'calls all Arab and
foreign countries' to advise their citizens to leave Egypt and 'preserve
their lives'. It urged 'Egyptians, Arabs and foreigners' to 'call off' their
investments in the country. 'Investments, but not the investors, could soon
become a target to our just revenge,' it said.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Milken goes free - up to a point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL MILKEN, freed from federal custody this week, must now decide how
to serve the 1,800 hours of community service in each of the next three
years required to fulfil his sentence for securities fraud.
The former head of the high yield bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert,
and the driving force behind the growth of 'junk bond' financing in the
1980s, still faces strict curbs on his activities. The Securities and
Exchange Commission has banned him for life from the brokerage industry.
He also faces trouble of a more personal kind - coping with prostate cancer.
Mr Milken had spent 22 months in a prison in Northern California, having
pleaded guilty in 1990 to charges of violating US securities law, and then a
further month in a halfway house - which had once been the residence of Mary
Pickford, the movie star - in Hollywood.
For the 30 days immediately before his official release from federal custody
on Tuesday, Mr Milken had lived at his California home, under government
supervision.
He had originally been sentenced to a 10-year prison term by Judge Kimba
Wood, in the New York Federal District Court, a particularly heavy penalty
when compared with the treatment of other Wall Street criminals.
However, this sentence was subsequently cut to two years, on the grounds
that the former financier had agree to co-operate with the authorities. Mr
Milken must now present a community service proposal to the judge.
In retrospect, there has been much debate over the extent of Mr Milken's
co-operation; critics of the sentence reduction note that his public
testimony against former colleagues at Drexel has been ambiguous and not
particularly helpful to prosecutors.
However, in February last year, the financier agreed to pay an additional
Dollars 500m (Pounds 352m) into a Dollars 1.3bn 'pool', to be divided among
the various parties who had filed claims against Drexel Burnham Lambert.
The investment bank, now defunct, went into bankruptcy in 1990.
Mr Milken had already paid Dollars 400m into an SEC disgorgement fund, and
the aggregate Dollars 900m penalty was said to represent 80 per cent of his
personal wealth. However, this figure did not allow for assets held by Mr
Milken's wife, Lori, or by his family.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Spotlight turns on blind cleric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISLAMIC extremism in the US has been most emphatically represented for the
past three years by Sheikh Omar Abdul-Rahman, a 54-year-old Egyptian
preacher.
Since the sheikh arrived in the US in 1990, apparently on a tourist visa,
Cairo has repeatedly asked its ally to curb the activities of a man widely
regarded in Egypt as the spiritual inspiration for violent Islamic groups in
the country which have recently spearheaded a series of lethal attacks on
foreign visitors.
The US immigration service said last month it was still considering a move
to deport the cleric, on the grounds that he was a polygamist - he has three
wives - and had once falsified a cheque in Egypt, both grounds for
deportation.
Attention has focused on the sheikh because Mr Mohammed Salameh, the
26-year-old Arab charged on Thursday with the bomb attack on the World Trade
Centre, prayed at the New Jersey mosque at which the Egyptian cleric
occasionally preaches.
In a statement yesterday published through an Arab-American leader, Sheikh
Abdul-Rahman 'unequivocally denounced the bombing'. Dr MT Mehdi,
secretary-general of the National Council on Islamic Affairs, said the
sheikh told him: 'The holy Koran commands the faithful not to commit
aggression. . . the bombing of the World Trade Centre could not have been
done by a true Moslem.'
Sheikh Abdul-Rahman's cause within Egypt has been clear-cut for more than a
decade: the establishment of an Islamic state. In 1982 the blind preacher,
who is said to have memorised a braille copy of the Koran at the age of 11,
was acquitted in the trial of Islamists accused of assassinating President
Anwar Sadat. The sheikh was accused of issuing the fatwa, or edict, calling
for Sadat's killing.
Today, in a call smuggled into Egypt on tens of thousands of tape cassettes,
the sheikh brands the present government of President Hosni Mubarak
'corrupt' and a 'dictatorship', accusing the government of oppressing,
jailing and torturing Islamic activists.
In a recent BBC interview from his New Jersey home, Sheikh Abdul-Rahman said
that the 'oppressor' government of Egypt had to be overthrown.
Such statements have led Sheikh Abdul-Rahman to be seen in Egypt as the
spiritual elder for the Gama'a el-Islamiyya, the shadowy militant Islamic
group which has claimed responsibility for most of the recent attacks on
tourists in Egypt.
Although Sheikh Abdul-Rahman claims not to be part of the group, he does
nothing to distance himself from their cause.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Quick success is good news for G-men: Unused to terrorism,
New York can take it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUDGE William Sessions was almost cheerful this week. The beleaguered head
of the FBI, whose job appears to hang by a thread, was able to appear
constantly on television, eventually announcing an arrest in the World Trade
Centre bombing. He was also not on the spot for the siege in Waco, Texas,
because the Bureau of Arms, Tobacco and Firearms, which may have bungled its
initial raid on the religious cult last Sunday, does not fall under his
jurisdiction.
While he was able to exude unaccustomed confidence, initial public reaction
to the detention of Mr Mohammed Salameh has been dominated by praise for the
forensic detective work of the FBI and the local New York police.
Even without the unexpectedly quick arrest in this case, both New York and
the country seem to have taken the events of the last week in their stride.
The US has, by international standards, been quite free of acts of terrorism
on its own soil in the last decade.
But, as the siege of Waco, the recent gangland-style execution of six people
in the Bronx and a shooting outside the CIA in January, allegedly by a
Pakistani citizen, all demonstrate, it is only too familiar with violence.
A typical reaction from a public figure was provided by Mr Peter Jennings,
the ABC TV anchorman, who was asked on Thursday after a speech at Howard
University in Washington if he thought the country had been traumatised by
the New York bombing. He brusquely dismissed as rubbish one tabloidesque
piece of reporting which had concluded 'America will never be the same
again.'
As Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York said: 'The greatest threat to this
country is not some group gone mad over religion in the Middle East
somewhere. It's what we do to ourselves with violence, with drugs. The
people in Waco didn't fly in here from Mesopotamia.'
Under the surface calm, to which even normally excitable New Yorkers seem to
subscribe, there is some concern at the reminder that terrorist groups can
and do operate in the US. This sentiment has been fanned by self-styled
security experts, much in demand this week by the media.
A typical example was one opinion piece in the New York Times which said
'the new world disorder means we'll be a bigger target' but provided little
justification for its prognostication. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb
leader, also issued a warning that US involvement in Bosnia could make it
vulnerable to terrorism, but, under pressure, he later said his comments had
been 'mistranslated'.
Another prescient and factual article in the same newspaper two weeks ago
had detailed the known activities of presumed terrorist groups inside the
US.
The article quoted Israeli intelligence as believing that command of Hamas,
the radical Palestinian group, was exercised not from Beirut or Tehran but
from a house in suburban Virginia. But the prevalent view of the quoted
experts was that, as with the IRA, the US has mostly been a source of
funding and some recruitment for activities well away from American shores.
The last big arrest of a foreign terrorist in the US was that of Mr Yu
Kikumura of the Japanese Red Army, picked up in a bomb-laden car by a New
Jersey highway patrolman in 1988. There is also evidence that the El Rukhn
black extremist group in Chicago was plotting with Libya to bring down a
domestic US aircraft about five years ago.
General Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser in the Bush
administration, this week said he believed Iran was the country now most
responsible for sustaining various terrorist groups, though not necessarily
controlling all of them. Also this week Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary
of state, expressed the hope that Russia would not sell arms to Iran, in
part for the same reason.
However, there is simply no evidence that US foreign policy is about to be
affected by the implication of Islamic fundamentalists in the New York
bombing. If New Yorkers could take it in their stride, the Clinton
administration could hardly do less.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Iran urged to cut trade agreements with UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAN was urged yesterday to cancel trade agreements with Britain because of
the row over the author Salman Rushdie. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, one of
Iran's most outspoken clerics, said yesterday parliament should review
economic and trade relations with Britain because of its insults to Islam.
Speaking at Friday prayers in Tehran, Ayatollah Jannati said a meeting last
month between Mr Rushdie and Mr Douglas Hogg, a minister at the Foreign
Office, was aimed at 'shattering Islam's dignity and opening the way for
anyone to insult Moslem sanctities'. He added that it was a tactic aimed at
forcing Iran to submit to Britain's wishes.
Britain has recently stepped up its demands that Iran should withdraw the
religious ruling, or fatwa, passed by the late Ayatollah Khomeini which
calls on Moslems to kill Mr Rushdie for sentiments expressed in his book The
Satanic Verses. Ayatollah Jannati said yesterday it was a divine ruling
which 'sooner or later, would be carried out'.
He added that trade with Britain could be replaced by dealing with other
countries. 'Whatever we buy from Britain can very easily be bought
elsewhere,' he said.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, is expected to meet Mr Rushdie
within the next few weeks to underline the government's insistence that the
fatwa has to be withdrawn before diplomatic relations between the two
countries can improve.

<TEXT>
THE US and its allies are preparing to tighten sanctions against Serbia and
looking for other ways to end the conflict in Bosnia, President Bill Clinton
said yesterday. He spoke as hopes of a breakthrough in the Bosnian peace
talks in New York dwindled.
Mr Clinton said details of the new measures would be revealed soon.
The announcement came as Russia said it would join the US in making
air-drops of humanitarian aid in eastern Bosnia. Starting in a week,
Ilyushin military transporters would drop 260 tons of aid over a two-week
period.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, the UN and EC mediators, met Bosnian President
Alija Izetbegovic for three hours yesterday and scheduled a meeting with him
today.
The talks took place in his New York hotel after the Bosnian leader
complained he was feeling unwell.
He cancelled a previously announced plan to leave for home last night. It
was unclear whether this was because of illness or the prospect of progress
in the negotiations, which now are focused on the Vance-Owen plan to divide
the country into 10 semi-autonomous provinces.
Mr Mate Boban and Mr Mile Akmadzic, the Bosnian Croat leaders, took part in
yesterday's meeting but there was again no face-to-face contact with Mr
Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader. However, a UN spokesman said Mr
Vance and Lord Owen hoped to meet him today.
He too had been expected to leave New York last night but apparently agreed
to remain after reports circulated that he might be isolated as the only
leader to hold out on the division plan, assuming Mr Izetbegovic eventually
agreed.
In New York, Bosnia's UN ambassador, Mr Muhamed Sacirbey, dampened
expectations that the Moslems were on the point of signing the agreement on
dividing Bosnia-Hercegovina, following their approval of ceasefire and
military disengagement arrangements on Wednesday.
Countering forecasts by the mediators that there would be a breakthrough on
the plan, which has so far been signed only by the Bosnian Croats, Mr
Sacirbey said his government still had strong concerns.
In particular, further clarification was needed on how power would be shared
between the proposed provinces and the central government, which would be
responsible for foreign relations.
The Bosnian Serbs, who have been assigned 43 per cent of Bosnia's territory,
compared with the 70 per cent they now occupy, also have reservations about
the proposed map. This is the most controversial element of the three-part
peace plan, which also includes a constitutional framework and a military
agreement.
Meanwhile, the French commander of UN troops in Bosnia set out to cross Serb
battle lines in an armoured convoy to assess the plight of the Moslem
settlement of Cerska.
The UN had been unable to persuade Bosnian Serb commanders to allow aid
workers into Cerska, reportedly overrun by Serb forces. General Philippe
Morillon was last night reported to be negotiating with Serb commanders.
Unconfirmed reports from amateur radio operators, the only source of
information from the besieged area and nearby Konjevic Polje, have said that
hundreds of people have been killed and thousands were fleeing the region.
Radio Sarajevo carried an appeal from Cerska's local leaders to Mr Clinton
to rescue them. 'How long can this go on? The world watches and does
nothing,' the appeal said.
In Sarajevo a convoy carrying aid sent jointly by Serb Catholic and Moslem
charities was hit by grenades, injuring four drivers. Bosnian Serbs blamed
Moslem forces and ordered a halt to aid convoys while talks were held with
the UN to guarantee their safety.
Elsewhere heavy snowfalls stranded more than 50 UN aid trucks on narrow
mountain roads in Bosnia.
The commander of UN troops in former Yugoslavia for the past year
acknowledged yesterday that there was widespread dissatisfaction with their
current mandate, saying this would have to be changed.
Lieutenant General Satish Nambiar, who is returning to Indian army service,
agreed with the view that the peacekeepers might have to be authorised to
use force to implement a peace settlement.
Gen Nambiar emphasised that all the heavy weapons now in the possession of
the warring groups would have to be brought under UN control to make a
ceasefire effective.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and China have agreed the principles for talks about Hong Kong's
political future but there remain a 'few points of disagreement', Mr Chris
Patten, Hong Kong's governor, told the colony's legislature yesterday.
Mr Patten told the 60-strong Legislative Council (LegCo) that he had decided
to defer the introduction of his legislation - which provides for a more
democratic electoral system in Hong Kong - for a fourth time in an effort to
secure 'productive talks' with the Chinese government.
He said that the community would expect him to go 'the extra mile' if, by so
doing, he helped ensure the talks proceeded. But Mr Patten said that he
could not defer his legislation indefinitely.
His address, which had been billed as an attempt to rebuild support among
his followers, did little to quell their disquiet about the course of action
he has decided upon.
Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, the main group of elected
politicians in LegCo, said the governor had failed to say when his
legislation would be tabled.
In a swipe at Mr Patten, he said 'the general impression is that the
governor will do his best to defer'. As for the prospect of negotiations, Mr
Lee added: 'The track record of the British negotiating team is not very
encouraging; every time they sit down with the Chinese government they end
up on their knees.'
The sticking points to talks are China's objection to Hong Kong government
officials as part of the UK negotiating team. China also wants to keep the
timetable for talks secret.
Mr Patten told LegCo that the UK had told China nearly a month ago about the
composition of its team - which includes two senior Hong Kong government
officials.
The British government does not recognise China's right to dictate whom it
can field in negotiations with Beijing. It seems unlikely that talks could
proceed without China's withdrawal of these preconditions.
Mr Patten went out of his way to appear cautious on the prospect of talks.
He underlined the difficulty of the task facing Britain and China if the two
sides do agree to negotiations. He said he hoped they would produce a result
which met his principles of being 'open, fair and acceptable' to the people
of Hong Kong.
'But,' he said, 'these are very difficult matters. . . and I hope that we
can approach them in a spirit of realism.'
Although the government expects China to agree to talks, it has not been
encouraged by China's attitude to date. The government appears prepared to
break off negotiations if they believe Beijing is simply stalling.

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OZONE levels over much of Europe and North America were the lowest on record
last month, falling more than a fifth below normal, and have been
persistently below normal this winter.
Revealing the figures yesterday, the World Meteorological Organisation said
possible causes were the continuing release of ozone-destroying chemicals
into the earth's atmosphere and winter weather conditions which have pushed
ozone-poor air north from the sub-tropical Atlantic.
High-level ozone filters harmful ultra-violet rays from the sun, which can
damage plant, marine and animal life and cause skin cancers and cataracts in
humans.
The UN agency stressed that the northern hemisphere was not experiencing
massive ozone destruction of the kind that has produced an ozone 'hole' over
the Antarctic. It said there was no need for special precautions against
extra ultra-violet radiation, since little reached the earth's surface in
winter. The periods of low ozone were short, the sun was low in the sky and
the weather was often cloudy.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Tokyo hit by trade policy wrangle
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN intense bureaucratic fight is under way in Tokyo over Japan's trade
policy and the extent to which the economy should be stimulated to increase
demand for imports.
This comes as Japan's current account surplus rose 82.9 per cent in January
from the year before to Dollars 5.21bn. The figures, published yesterday,
will intensify pressure on Japan to boost its domestic economy to cut its
trade surplus.
The steep rise in the surplus comes as Tokyo is attempting to formulate its
trade policy towards the US before Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
visits Washington next month.
The surplus is likely to expand further before Mr Miyazawa's visit as the US
economy sucks in Japanese exports and the yen's recent appreciation against
the dollar boosts their value in dollar terms. The dollar closed at an
all-time low in Tokyo yesterday of Y116.47.
A Ministry of International Trade and Industry survey published yesterday
found that 84 per cent of major companies were being hit by the yen's
appreciation, while 60 per cent said they would have to take streamlining
measures if the yen continued to rise in the next few weeks.
Unadjusted, January's trade surplus, which excludes services, expanded by 18
per cent to Dollars 7.03bn, mainly because modest growth in exports was
combined with the continuing slump in Japanese demand for imports.
Exports in January rose to Dollars 23.67bn from Dollars 23.39bn a year
before, while imports dropped to Dollars 16.64bn from Dollars 17.43bn.
The January figures mean that the aggregate current account surplus in the
first 10 months of the fiscal year ending this March stands at Dollars
95.44bn, already more than the record surplus of Dollars 94.1bn recorded in
1986.
The aggregate trade surplus for the first 10 months of the financial year
was Dollars 108.27bn, a 22.6 per cent rise on the same period last year.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Czechs impose stiffer rules for new banks

<TEXT>
THE CZECH National Bank has introduced tougher requirements for banks
wishing to set up in the Czech Republic. Banks will now have to deposit 300m
crowns (Pounds 7m) with the central bank before starting up, Mr Josef
Tosovsky, bank governor, said yesterday. Until now, foreign and local banks
were required to place only a third of the deposit with the central bank on
start-up.
Over the last three years, the number of banks with a full banking licence
in the Czech republic has risen from seven to 48, including six
foreign-owned banks. Such rapid expansion has imposed a heavy strain on the
limited availability of experienced bank staff and led to widespread staff
poaching.
Meanwhile, the Czech authorities are preparing a small revaluation of the
Czech crown against the Ecu-denominated clearing account set up to regulate
trade between the Czech and Slovak republics.
Since the former joint currency split into separate Czech and Slovak crowns
last month the Slovak authorities have made three small devaluations
totalling 5 per cent against the clearing-Ecu. The latest Czech move is
expected to raise the effective overall devaluation of the Slovak crown in
bilateral trade with the Czech Republic to 7 per cent.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Rocard's big bang hardly ruffles polls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S unpopular ruling Socialist Party has recovered fractionally,
according to the latest opinion poll, but still faces heavy defeat in the
elections in two weeks' time.
The poll, for Le Nouvel Observateur magazine, puts the Socialists up one
point over the past month at 21 per cent. It attributes this to the impact
of former French prime minister Michel Rocard's call for a political 'big
bang' to form a new grouping of human rights supporters, moderates and
ecologists.
This small shift has a bigger effect on parliamentary seats, because of the
France's first past-the-post constituency voting system. So the Socialists
now stand to win 122 seats in the 577-seat national assembly, up from 40 in
last month's Sofres poll and down from 247 now. Overall, the poll gives the
opposition alliance of Gaullist RPR and centre right UDF between 396 and 423
parliamentary seats.
The poll puts the UDF and RPR neck and neck, with 19 per cent of the vote
each, thanks to a slight loss in RPR popularity and a small gain by the UDF.
This throws fresh uncertainty over the identity of the next prime minister,
who until recently seemed more likely to be a Gaullist rather than UDF
member. The final choice rests with President Francois Mitterrand, who
traditionally picks the prime minister from the majority grouping, though
the constitution sets no formal limit on his choice.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Bundesbank policymakers are back in driving seat: They may
now use repo operations more often to steer money market rates downwards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a slice of salami, a step in the right direction, a signal, a carrot,
and most of all another surprise. Economists and sundry commentators trawled
the thesaurus for suitable reactions yesterday after the Bundesbank gave
German interest rates a further downwards prod.
The cut of almost a quarter point in rates for next week's securities
repurchase deals was all of these. Even though Mr Johann Gaddum, a
directorate member, was wheeled out later to announce that the change was
not to be seen as an indicator that the discount and Lombard rates would
fall at the next council meeting on March 18, no-one was in a mood to
believe him.
The cut in the repo rate to within 0.25 points of the 8 per cent discount
rate - the official floor level - was read as the second signal in a month
that official short-term rates are on a downward slope. 'We are on the way
from point A to point B. It is now a question of how we get there and how
quickly,' said Mr Richard Reid, chief economist at the Union Bank of
Switzerland in Frankfurt.
But Mr Gaddum's argument that current data suggested a need for 'small
steps' was widely accepted, at least until progress is made on budget
consolidation and the French elections are out of the way. 'Then the dancing
can really begin,' suggested Mr Adolf Rosenstock, chief economist at the
local office of the Industrial Bank of Japan.
The Bundesbank's latest move was also seen as a sign that its policymakers
have regained control of their strategy and tactics after disturbances in
the European exchange rate mechanism forced a hasty cut in official rates at
their early February meeting. If there are no more ERM upsets - a tricky
scenario in the light of the impending French elections - the Bundesbank can
be expected to continue using its 'repo operations' to steer money market
rates downwards and cutting official rates as they fall.
Yesterday's manoeuvre also underlined a point which Mr Schlesinger has been
trying to make for some months, that the repo instrument is not only a more
flexible tool than the official rates, it is a more important indicator. As
Mr Hermann Remsperger, chief economist at the BHF bank noted, yesterday's
cut was nothing less than a 'reduction in leading rates'.
According to Mr Rosenstock, the central council, which includes the heads of
the regional central banks, had now stopped its internal squabbling. The
February reductions in official rates had harmed the bank's credibility, but
now a consensus appeared to have been reached. 'They are singing with one
voice like a choir,' he added. 'At least there are not so many soloists.' A
sudden and marked reduction in the number of speeches and lectures delivered
by individual members tends to support this view.
While international pressure for rate cuts in the interests of protecting
the ERM and easing the climb out of recession has been uncomfortable, the
greatest source of tension among council members has probably been Germany's
own economic plunge. Regional representatives have been trailing into
Frankfurt every fortnight with ever grimmer tales of economic woe. A 22 per
cent slump in January's industrial output in Baden-Wurttemberg, reported
yesterday, was only the latest example.
But they seem to have been convinced that regional and national interests
are best served in the long run if the bank keeps its deliberations focused
on its main responsibilities, D-Mark stability and control of inflation, and
returns to its traditionally cautious tactics.
Pressure for rate cuts from within the federal government has been
effectively diverted back to Bonn, which now holds the key to the extent and
timing of the next discount and Lombard changes. Fading money supply growth,
sub-inflation wage deals and a just-discernible downward shift in prices
meet some of the criteria for cuts, but Chancellor Helmut Kohl has still to
convince the Bundesbank that public spending and deficits will be reined in
effectively.
Mr Kohl meets negotiators from the 16 Lander (states) on March 11 for up to
three days of key talks on his solidarity pact for funding revival in the
east. According to Mr Rosenstock, a comprehensive deal to complete the
chancellor's solidarity package would be a great surprise. 'But if they get
half way to a reasonable agreement, March 18 could be the day.'
However, as the Bundesbank council showed this week when it sprang its
surprise package a day after its routine meeting, the last thing it wants is
for its agenda to be set either by the markets or by the media, or for its
decisions to become wholly predictable.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Companies cut back on recruitment
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies are scaling back recruitment in an attempt to cut costs
and adjust to leaner times.
Japan Air Lines yesterday said it would defer hiring 375 stewardesses for
five months. Seibu Department Store, a leading retailer, plans to halve its
recruiting next year from about 439 in fiscal 1993. Toyota, the leading car
maker, has for the first time in five years stopped hiring full- time
production workers outside the usual recruiting period.
There is growing public and government concern about the cancellations and
their effect on society. The Ministry of Labour said this week it would
propose amending part of the Employment Security Law to require companies
planning to cancel promised employment to graduates to notify public job
security agencies and school authorities. The companies themselves would be
publicly identified.
Fourteen companies have so far cancelled the hiring of 211 graduates who had
been told that they would be hired from April. Japanese law has no provision
for punishing violators of the gentleman's agreement known as naitei, by
which graduates are promised employment at companies and are themselves more
or less committed to that promise.
The ministry hopes to introduce its new measure by the end of the month
after receiving a report from its advisory council. Japanese companies are
reluctant to make employees redundant, as such moves are frowned upon by
society, and cancelling recruitment plans is one of the few options
available to them to cut employment costs.
However, the government has become concerned about the social impact of such
moves, and the ministry has publicly asked corporations not to cut their
workforces drastically in an attempt to cut costs.
JAL said that it had decided to postpone hiring the stewardesses because the
number of flights it will have during the period will be less than planned
as a result its restructuring programme.
By September, the airline says, it should be able to hire new recruits as
other stewardesses retire.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Employment in the US surges ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy created more than a third of a million jobs between January
and February, the biggest increase in four years and a sign that employers
are finally gaining sufficient confidence to hire more workers.
The unemployment rate, however, declined only 0.1 percentage points to 7.0
per cent, reflecting a large increase in the labour force last month.
President Bill Clinton yesterday welcomed the figures but warned that there
remained 'stark challenges ahead'. He indicated that the administration
remained committed to its Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21bn) short-term fiscal
stimulus, saying that it would would create 700,000 jobs this summer and
send a 'profoundly important signal' to the American people. Ms Dee Dee
Myers, the White House press secretary, said: 'We're shooting for full
employment.'
The surge in employment far exceeded expectations on Wall Street, where most
analysts had projected a gain of little more than 100,000 jobs. The dollar
rose sharply in early trading to stand at DM1.6675 by midday. The Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 15.94 to 3414.85.
Non-farm payroll employment rose 365,000 to 109.2m in February, the first
month that the economy has generated jobs in the numbers normally expected
in a recovery from recession. However, figures for January were revised down
to show a gain of only 44,000 against an initial estimate of 106,000.
Two thirds of last month's increase was in service industries, with retail
employment rising 131,000 to 19.3m, the biggest gain in five years.
Construction employment rose 96,000 to 4.6m, reversing small declines in
recent months.
Manufacturing employment was flat at 18.1m. However, the Labor Department
reported an increase in factory hours to the highest level since 1966.
Overtime hours are at the highest level on record, suggesting that
manufacturers will soon have to hire more workers.
Mr Robert Reich, the secretary of labour, questioned the quality of the
employment gain, noting that a large proportion of the new jobs were
part-time. The jobless rate, while well below last year's peak of 7.7 per
cent, was still higher than at the end of the recession nearly two years
ago.
Mr John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street
securities house, said the figures pointed to 'sturdy and self-sustaining'
growth and undermined fears that the economy was running into a stall after
robust growth in the fourth quarter.
The consensus view is that the economy will expand at an annual rate of
about 3 per cent this quarter, down from nearly 5 per cent in the final
quarter of last year but in line with White House projections.

</HEADLINE>

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION and harsh winter weather drove German unemployment up to almost
3.5m last month. An increase of 42,000 in the west was partly offset by a
10,000 drop in the east, but short-time working increased by 200,000 to
almost 1.25m.
Meanwhile, the Bayer chemicals group unveiled plans to put 3,000 people on
short time, and Porsche, the sports car maker, confirmed the loss of a
further 1,800 jobs during the course of this year.
The rise in unemployment, taking the rate to 7.5 per cent in the west and
14.5 per cent in the east, is expected to continue for at least another
year. According to new Deutsche Bank forecasts, the total will hit 4m in
early 1994.
Yesterday's news was accompanied by further evidence of the rapid advance of
recession into manufacturing. In Baden-Wurttemberg, home state to
Daimler-Benz and Porsche, industrial output during January was 22 per cent
lower than a year earlier.
This compared with an average fall of 13 per cent in other Lander (states),
the regional government said. Output from the motor industry, hit especially
hard by short-time working, fell more than 50 per cent.
Turnover in the west's wholesale trade slumped a real 12 per cent in
January, the federal statistics office said. No breakdown of the figure was
available, although analysts said the drop was caused partly by a shopping
boom late last year in advance of an increase in value added tax on January
1.
Mr Johann Eekhoff, a top Economics Ministry official, said wage increases
should be held below the rate of growth in productivity for an 'extended
period'. The labour market had to undergo a 'massive structural change', he
said.
In addition to those unemployed and working short time, a further 300,000
east Germans were being kept off the jobless register in
government-subsidised work creation programmes. He also complained that
large numbers of people were employed in uneconomic state-subsidised
industries.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Government onslaught on Euro-sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S senior colleagues last night launched a concerted onslaught
on the Conservative party's Euro-sceptics as the prime minister sought to
revive his government's battered political fortunes.
The attempt at the Conservatives' spring conference in Harrogate to isolate
opponents of the Maastricht treaty was led by Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign
secretary, and Sir Norman Fowler, party chairman. It coincided with a
similarly orchestrated effort by ministers to convince a wider UK audience
that the economy is emerging from recession.
That will be followed later today by an upbeat speech by Mr Major himself in
which he will claim that the economy of the UK - and its government - are
now turning the corner.
Underlining the government's intention to speed up the Maastricht
ratification process, Mr Hurd said that as long as the debate over the
treaty continued the Conservatives were left 'divided' and Britain was
'unable to pull its weight'.
Voicing weariness with the protracted debate at Westminster, Mr Hurd said:
'It's in the national interest that we ratify the treaty. Let's get on with
it.'
He warned that if the trench warfare in the House of Commons was allowed to
derail the treaty, British ministers would be reduced to 'bit-part players'
in deliberations on the future of Europe.
Economic recovery in Britain would be jeopardised as its European partners
pushed ahead without restraint with their plans for a single currency.
As Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, picked up the same themes, Mr Hurd confirmed that the
government had decided to complete the ratification process before the
parliamentary recess in July or early August.
Mr Clarke told reporters that the Conservatives had always tolerated dissent
but the cabinet now judged that it was threatening the authority of the
government. 'Enough is enough is what we are now saying to the Euro-rebels,'
he said.
That foreshadows several fresh confrontations with the party's Euro-sceptics
over the next few weeks as Tory business managers seek to accelerate the
pace of the detailed scrutiny of the legislation in the House of Commons.
But senior ministers were emphasising privately that the cabinet was now
determined to staunch the wounds inflicted by the ratification process.
In an effort to detach the dissidents on the Tory backbenches from their
local constituency associations, Sir Norman issued a blunt demand to the
activists at yesterday's meeting of the central council for loyalty both to
the government's European policy and to Mr Major personally.
In deliberately uncompromising language, Sir Norman said party unity could
not be regarded as an 'optional extra' by Tory MPs, reminding them that they
should 'never forget' that Mr Major had led the Conservatives to their
fourth election victory. For his part, Mr Heseltine accused the
Euro-sceptics of undermining Mr Major's influence with his European
counterparts in future negotiations.
Sir Norman made a veiled threat that senior MPs opposed to the treaty might
risk their executive seats on the 1922 committee of backbench MPs if they
continued to vote against the government on procedural motions.
Senior ministers, however, played down suggestions from some pro-Europeans
that rebel Tory MPs might face expulsion from the party.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Italy acts to limit fall-out from corruption scandals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY's fragile four-party coalition last night agreed on controversial
legislation to limit the political and economic damage of the ever-expanding
corruption scandals that started a year ago.
The moves, agreed after a day-long cabinet session, centre on a complete
overhaul of the funding of political parties and the sanctions attached to
illicit contributions. Other measures include more transparent rules for
tendering on contracts - the main source of bribes paid to the political
parties.
In announcing the measures, Prof Giuliano Amato, the prime minister,
insisted Italy's political establishment had not agreed to provide an
all-embracing amnesty to those politicians, officials and businessmen caught
up in the series of scandals.
The government said the crime of extortion in particular would still be
enforced - where politicians and officials oblige busimessmen to hand over
money to obtain contracts. But this extortion is considered by lawyers to be
one of the hardest offences to prove. It is also one of the charges which
Milan magistrates are seeking to have waived for Mr Bettino Craxi, the
former Socialist leader.
Although part of the legislation is in the form of decrees and will have
immediate effect, it will still require endorsement by parliament. Such
backing is far from guaranteed. Indeed, the government has taken a serious
gamble with public opinion and the mood of parliament in promoting the
measures which can be a seen as a barely disguised means of providing an
honourable exit to a disgraced establishment.
It is also far from clear how the judiciary will react.
The government argues that the investigations into corruption risked getting
out of hand - both in overloading the judiciary and in decapitating the
political class. At the same time public works activity has been brought to
a near standstill by the scandals.
The scandals originated in kick-backs on Milan municipal works contracts but
now cover almost every area of public life in the country's main cities.
More than 50 parliamentarians are caught up in the affair and two parties'
leaders have been forced to resign, including Mr Craxi, of the Socialist
party.
The new rules on funding political parties make illicit finance a mere
misdemeanour sanctioned by harsh fines and disqualification from office. But
many of the details still require intricate elaboration. The cabinet failed
to agree on changes in the rules on preventive detention, a controversial
weapon used by magistrates in the investigations to force confessions.
Last night it appeared that the main beneficiaries of the legislation would
be those who had already confessed to either paying or receiving bribes
connected to party finance. Also those who now come forward could benefit
from plea-bargaining.

FT  06 MAR 93 / German rate cut lifts markets: UK equities rise to record
highs - US shows fresh signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING financial markets around the world gathered strength yesterday after
the Bundesbank unexpectedly eased German monetary policy and the US economy
showed new signs of maintaining its recovery from recession.
British equities rose to record highs while sterling and the dollar forged
ahead after a clear signal that the Bundesbank was committed to gradual
reductions in interest rates and news of better-than-expected job creation
in the US.
Less than 24 hours after it disappointed financial markets by leaving its
discount and Lombard rates unchanged, the German central bank cut the rate
at which it offers wholesale funds to the country's banking system by just
under a quarter of a percentage point.
The cut in the securities repurchase - or repo - rate to 8.25 per cent from
8.49 per cent was widely seen as signalling a reduction in the discount and
Lombard rates from 8 and 9 per cent respectively when the Bundesbank's
central council next meets on March 18.
British officials said the German cut did not pave the way for a further
easing in UK monetary policy, but the move triggered rises on the UK equity
and bond markets. Prices also jumped in many, but not all, continental
European centres.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index closed at a new high of 2,922.1, up 17.3
points on the day. Gilts of all maturities also rose with the benchmark 9
per cent gilt due in 2008 rising by  27/32 points.
Dutch, French and Belgian stock markets also gained while stock markets in
Frankfurt and Zurich closed down slightly. On foreign exchange markets,
sterling rose by over 3 pfennigs to close in London at DM2.41. Boosted by
the US employment figures, the dollar rose over 3 pfennigs, closing at
DM1.6670 in London. In New York the pound closed at DM2.4138 and the dollar
at DM1.66835.
The German rate cut was a response mainly to domestic conditions. Growth in
inflation, wages and money supply has moderated recently, while a spreading
domestic recession also influenced the central bank's decisions. Yesterday's
changes coincided with the announcement of a sharp rise in German
unemployment to almost 3.5m and a surge of 200,000 in the number of people
working short time.
Mr Johann Gaddum, a member of the Bundesbank's directorate, said current
domestic economic data indicated that rates should be reduced in small
steps.
He tried to damp speculation about the next move. There was no more room for
manoeuvre at present, he said, and no one should count on an automatic cut
in the discount and Lombard rates at the next council meeting. But Mr Hilmar
Kopper, head of Deutsche Bank, said borrowing costs were on the way down.
While most economists believe the discount and Lombard rates will fall to 6
per cent and 7 per cent respectively by the end of the year, prospects for
early changes to official rates depend on the outcome of talks between Bonn
and the 16 state governments on public spending cuts. Chancellor Helmut Kohl
has called a meeting with regional leaders for March 11.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, Germany's new economics minister, yesterday stood by
official forecasts that the economy will stagnate this year and start to
recover in early 1994 at the latest.

FT  06 MAR 93 / 'Wise man' attacks wisdom of fellow economists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AUTHORITY of the government's new panel of economic advisers, who are
known as the 'seven wise men', has been thrown into doubt by a blistering
attack by Professor Tim Congdon, a member of the group, on the intellectual
capabilities of his fellow members.
In an open letter to the other six members of the panel, Prof Congdon says
his colleagues are 'like literary critics who read prose but never look at
poetry, or mathematicians who understand arithmetic but are bewildered by
algebra'.
The letter, to be published next week, says his fellow panellists' lack of
understanding of economic theory led them mistakenly to advise the Treasury
two weeks ago against a tax rise in the March 16 Budget.
Prof Congdon, alone of the group, wants a Pounds 12bn tax increase in
1993-94 to curb the growing fiscal deficit. A leading monetarist, he is an
adviser at Gerrard &amp; National, the City discount house, and a part-time
professor at Cardiff Business School.
In the 12-page letter to be published in Gerrard &amp; National's monthly
economic review, he suggests that in adhering to the general theories of the
UK economics community his fellow panellists have been 'grossly incompetent'
in failing to take adequate account of money balances.
His caustic lack of regard for his panellists - who he believes should go
back to examining basic economic textbooks - is likely to put a question
mark over the group's deliberations.
Professor Wynne Godley of Cambridge University, another panel member, said
Prof Congdon's view that he did not pay attention to money was 'crazy and
possibly libellous'.
Mr Andrew Sentance, economics director at the Confederation of British
Industry, and another panel member, said the remarks by Prof Congdon were
'unhelpful'. The Treasury played down the argument, saying the panel members
were 'free agents'.
Prof Congdon said he wanted to expose 'fundamental misunderstandings' among
many supposed experts in economic theory. He wanted to remain on the panel,
which met first only two months ago, but felt it vital for the group to
change its remit to look more fully at money supply.
He believes economic demand is influenced largely by the amount of money in
the economy, controlled by interest rates and other measures. As a result, a
tax rise would not necessarily prevent a recovery.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Companies cut back on recruitment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies are scaling back recruitment in an attempt to cut costs
and adjust to leaner times.
Japan Air Lines yesterday said it would defer hiring 375 stewardesses for
five months. Seibu Department Store, a leading retailer, plans to halve its
recruiting next year from about 439 in fiscal 1993. Toyota, the leading car
maker, has for the first time in five years stopped hiring full- time
production workers outside the usual recruiting period.
There is growing public and government concern about the cancellations and
their effect on society. The Ministry of Labour said this week it would
propose amending part of the Employment Security Law to require companies
planning to cancel promised employment to graduates to notify public job
security agencies and school authorities. The companies themselves would be
publicly identified.
Fourteen companies have so far cancelled the hiring of 211 graduates who had
been told that they would be hired from April. Japanese law has no provision
for punishing violators of the gentleman's agreement known as naitei, by
which graduates are promised employment at companies and are themselves more
or less committed to that promise.
The ministry hopes to introduce its new measure by the end of the month
after receiving a report from its advisory council. Japanese companies are
reluctant to make employees redundant, as such moves are frowned upon by
society, and cancelling recruitment plans is one of the few options
available to them to cut employment costs.
However, the government has become concerned about the social impact of such
moves, and the ministry has publicly asked corporations not to cut their
workforces drastically in an attempt to cut costs.
JAL said that it had decided to postpone hiring the stewardesses because the
number of flights it will have during the period will be less than planned
as a result its restructuring programme.
By September, the airline says, it should be able to hire new recruits as
other stewardesses retire.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Finance and the Family: Bonuses cut again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH-PROFITS pay-outs were cut again this week as four more life companies
announced bonuses for the year, writes John Authers. Ten-year pay-outs were
cut substantially, while 25-year maturity values - the term most often used
for endowment mortgages - were less affected, reflecting the higher
proportionate impact which the last few years of mediocre investment
performance have had on shorter term policies.
Pay-outs include two elements added on to a guaranteed 'sum assured' -
reversionary bonuses, added each year, and terminal bonuses, added only when
the policy matures. Reversionary bonuses tend to reflect anticipated future
returns and have largely withstood cuts thus far, but the pattern for
terminal bonuses is more mixed.
AXA Equity &amp; Law, which announced a cut in reversionary bonuses in January,
has now altered terminal bonuses. Depending on when the policy was started,
some terminal bonuses have decreased slightly and others have increased.
Assuming monthly premiums of Pounds 30 were paid on an endowment policy
started by a 29-year-old man, ten-year pay-outs are cut by 7.3 per cent from
Pounds 7,263 to Pounds 6,732, while 25-year maturities fall by 2.6 per cent
from Pounds 62,426 to Pounds 60,777.
Eagle Star Life made greater cuts, of 12.7 per cent from Pounds 6,896 to
Pounds 6,019 for ten-year pay-outs, and of 2.7 per cent from Pounds 61,910
to Pounds 60,188 for 25-year pay-outs. Not all these cuts were because of
bonus reductions. In 1983, Eagle Star raised the premiums needed to cover
the guaranteed sum assured, which accounts for part of the ten-year pay-out
adjustment. Equitable Life cut ten-year endowment pay-outs by 7.6 per cent
from Pounds 7,811 to Pounds 7,217, and 25-year pay-outs from Pounds 53,444
to Pounds 53,067. Sun Life cut ten-year pay-outs by 8 per cent from Pounds
7,029 to Pounds 6,467; 25-year pay-outs remained unchanged at Pounds 47,575.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Close poised to pay Pounds 15m for
Winterflood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINTERFLOOD Securities, the specialist smaller company marketmaker, is
likely to be sold to the the merchant banking group Close Brothers for about
Pounds 15m.
News of the sale emerged yesterday as Union Discount, the troubled discount
house group which owns Winterflood, announced that talks over a possible
disposal of the entire group had been abandoned.
The sale of the Union group, the oldest specialist money market operator in
London, is understood to have foundered over the inability to agree a price
for its troubled leasing business.
The potential buyer, thought to have been rival discount house group Cater
Allen, is believed to have argued that the leasing portfolio could contain
further losses in the future.
Union, on the other hand, claimed that leasing had become a more profitable
business in the wake of the recent fall in UK interest rates.
The sale of the Winterflood business to Close Brothers would help to bolster
Union's balance sheet and boost its prospects as an independent company.
Union's independence was thrown in doubt last year after it was forced to
increase provisions against its leasing business, pushing its share price
down from a high of 500p in 1990 to around 50p.
Union's 1992 results, expected to be announced as early as next week, are
expected to show that its core short-term money market business has improved
as interest rates have fallen, in line with other discount houses.
Mr Brian Winterflood, who founded the marketmaking company in 1988 to
concentrate on USM and Third Market stocks, refused to comment on the
identity of the potential purchaser yesterday. He said, though, his company
would be 'very happy' with the new parent.
'We will not change from what we are presently doing,' he said. It is not
expected that there will be any redundancies.
Mr Winterflood said his company had seen an increase in turnover in trade in
smaller companies' shares, particularly in the last three months. In the six
months to June 30, Union Discount's equity and gilt edged marketmaking -
which includes Winterfloods and Aitken Campbell &amp; Co - contributed profits
of Pounds 2.7m.
Mr Rod Kent, managing director of Close Brothers, could not be contacted for
comment yesterday.

FT  06 MAR 93 / Collecting: Queen Victoria still rules - Antony Thorncroft
thinks buyers are stirring from hibernation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the most famous of all Victorian images, Florence Nightingale
standing among the Crimean war wounded at Scutari, and Queen Victoria
visiting them in hospital in London, painted as a pair by Jerry Barrett,
sold at Christie's in London yesterday.
The dealer Hazlett Gooden &amp; Fox acquired them on behalf of the National
Portrait Gallery, which already owns sketches of the paintings. Florence
Nightingale went for Pounds 188,500, at the top of its estimate, and Queen
Victoria beat her forecast at Pounds 199,500.
What is odd about the paintings is that they have not been seen in public
since they were exhibited at Agnews in 1859 and were bought there by a
forefather of yesterday's seller for Pounds 870.
Their fame is totally dependent on the subsequent engravings, which entered
millions of Victorian homes.
Also surprising is that little is known about Barrett. His artistic
reputation survives on just these two paintings which were commissioned by
Agnews who paid for the artist to visit the Crimea. It proved an excellent
investment.
This has been a good week for Christie's which on Wednesday sold the
celebrated miniature by Nicholas Hilliard of 'A man clasping a hand from a
cloud' for Pounds 177,500, way ahead of the Pounds 50,000 estimate.
The owner, the late Shakespearean scholar, Leslie Hotson, was convinced that
the sitter was Shakespeare himself, but the expert on Elizabethan
portraiture, Sir Roy Strong, has decided it is Lord Thomas Howard, later 1st
Earl of Suffolk.
Yesterday Christie's announced that it has concluded a private treaty sale
with the National Gallery of Scotland which transfers a drawing by Raphael,
'The Madonna of the Fish', into its safe keeping.
The National Heritage Memorial Fund and the National Arts Collection Fund
helped the Museum pay for the drawing by respectively giving Pounds 100,000
and Pounds 50,000.
Slowly the salerooms are stirring back to life: the main auction rooms at
Sotheby's and Christie's have been deathly quiet since mid-December.
But Sotheby's too this week announced a major lot for disposal, one of the
most celebrated, and last, watercolours by Thomas Girtin. 'St Vincent's
Rocks, Clifton' was painted in 1802, the year of his death.
It comes on to the market on April 1 and should make at least Pounds 80,000,
helped by the renewed interest in British watercolours fostered by the two
important exhibitions currently taking place at the Royal Academy and the
British Museum.
The Original Print Fair closed at the Royal Academy last Sunday and was a
great success.
It was always likely that prints, relatively cheap to buy but the work of
great artists, would help lead the art world out of recession.
There were 12 per cent more visitors than last year and all the 28 dealers
made sales, often to overseas buyers. But, as a sign of the times, it was
prints under Pounds 10,000 which changed hands most rapidly.

A reassessment of Barclays' shock move to halve the final dividend after
absorbing its first ever preliminary loss, a move which triggered a plunge
in the bank's shares, led to a gradual rehabilitation of the stock price.
Despite a general wave of downward adjustments of current year estimates -
BZW lowered their current year expectation from Pounds 375m to Pounds 300m,
County moved down from Pounds 525m to Pounds 500m and Nikko reduced to
Pounds 415m - the market responded to a flurry of short covering and buying
on recovery hopes.
The rally in Barclays drove the shares up 16 to 408p with turnover in the
stock totalling a hefty 16m shares. NatWest, whose tier one capital ratio of
5.2 per cent was highlighted by analysts who pointed to the more secure 5.5
per cent provided by Barclays, suffered at the expense of Barclays shares,
closing 7 off at 437p.
Other banks shares mirrored the overall strength of the market with Standard
Chartered extending its recent outstanding market performance and closing a
further 6 up at 708p in front of Wednesday's preliminary results which are
now expected to come in above market expectations.
TSB attracted a fresh wave of takeover speculation which saw the shares race
up 8 to a new all-time peak of 183p.
Union Discount shares plunged 19 to 84p after takeover talks between the
discount house and an unnamed party were terminated. But the group said it
had received an offer for Winterflood Securities, its successful specialist
marketmaking subsidiary run by Mr Brian Winterflood.
The revelation of a strong profits increase by Barclays' securities arm,
BZW, plus the recent excellent figures announced by Kleinwort Benson, saw a
surge of interest in the merchant banks. Hambros jumped 10 to 328p, SG
Warburg put on 3 to 634p and Kleinwort Benson settled 4 up at 393p.
Food retailers shrugged off recent worries of an imposition of VAT in the UK
budget later this month. J Sainsbury gained 11 to 534p and Tesco firmed 4 to
249p. Argyll Group added 13 to 381p, boosted by a recommendation from BZW.
Mr Bill Currie at the securities house said: 'Trading is good especially in
the new stores and there are significant productivity benefits to come over
the next few years.'
NatWest Securities was the day's main buyer of Kingfisher and the shares
moved 13 ahead to 542p. The house said Thursday's falls had been overdone.
Vague talk that Argos was planning to dispose of its home furnishings
division was heard though it was quickly dismissed by analysts. The shares
were however strong and closed 10 better at 290p, with BZw said to be
positive on the stock.
Shares in Airtours gained 13 to 327 1/2 p, with dealers predicting success
in its bid for rival Owners Abroad, 6 better at 144p.
The latest sharp rise in oil prices - Brent crude jumped around 50 cents to
Dollars 19.70 a barrel - kept the oil sector on the move. The exploration
and production stocks were strongly supported, reflecting the recent push to
the sub-sector given by SG Warburg and the hike in oil prices. Enterprise
closed 10 up at 488p. Hopes of imminent asset disposals continued to drive
Lasmo, 3 firmer at 185p. Aran's strong acreage position west of the
Shetlands oil discovery made by BP and Shell triggered keen interest in Aran
shares which rose 2 to 27 1/2 p.
A combination of factors sent British Aerospace into retreat. Profit-taking,
combined with concerns that the company will have to repay around Pounds 60m
it received from the UK government in 'sweeteners', and lower than expected
sales from its Rover cars subsidiary, left the shares 7 lighter at 276p. TI
Group closed 10 up at 305p in heavy trading of 9.1m shares. Worries about
the poor outlook for the automotive sector in Germany weakened Laird Group,
and the shares eased 6 to 269p. A rise in UK new car registrations for
February boosted motor dealers. Thomas Cowie, which reported figures this
week, jumped 10 to 216p.
Whispers that Tadpole Technology will soon announce a significant deal sent
the shares sharply ahead, jumping 27 to 324p.

FT  06 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Schroder tops expectations with new trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Schroder has exceeded expectations in raising Pounds 100m for its new split
capital investment trust, called the Split Fund.
However, the demand was so unbalanced in favour of the income shares, which
yield 8 per cent tax-free if held in a Personal Equity Plan, that
applications for those shares have had to be scaled back.
Meanwhile, BZW and Schroders have been forced to buy around Pounds 27m of
the other two classes of shares, capital and zero dividend, in order to
create the right structure.
Between them, the two groups will own around 68 per cent of the zero
dividend shares and 35 per cent of the capital shares. Mr John Govett,
chairman of the Split Fund, said the shares were good investments.
In all 56.8m income shares, 37.7m zero dividend shares and 5.7m capital
shares have been allocated. Those who applied for under Pounds 25,000 of
income shares will receive all their allocation; applications above that
level will receive between 50 and 85 per cent.

FT  06 MAR 93 / International Company News: Row may hit Greencore
restructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A GROWING row in the Republic of Ireland over the sale of the government's
remaining 30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the sugar and foods company, now
looks increasingly likely to have a significant bearing on whether GPA, the
world's largest aircraft leasing company, succeeds in a debt restructuring
package with its banks to whom it owes Dollars 5.5bn (Pounds 3.87bn).
With encouragement from the Greencore board, the US food conglomerate ADM,
last month made a IPounds 66m offer, equivalent to IPounds 2.60 per share,
for the government's Greencore stake. But under political pressure, the
government this week decided to open up the sale to other offers with the
express intention of trying to find an Irish buyer.
Mr Gerry Murphy, the Greencore chief executive, says that he does not
believe such a move is in the best interests of the company and that the
board 'will do everything in its power to ensure that our ability to pursue
our stated strategy is at least safeguarded and hopefully enhanced, by the
ultimate ownership of the government's stake'.
Without naming ADM, Mr Murphy said that the board had found a 'long-term
partner with similar and complementary long-term . . . (which) apart from
supporting the group with capital for development, would bring unparalleled
access to world class technology in our core business, global market
intelligence and distribution capability'.
He said the move had 'the full support of the board following months of
preparatory work' and added that 'the board does not believe that any
potential Irish investor could bring the same benefits to the group in our
drive to become a more significant and more successful Irish-based
international food company'. Mr Joe Walsh, the agriculture minister,
confirmed this week that the offer had come from ADM.
It is likely that the Greencore board will now seek institutional
shareholder support to block any government sale of which it does not
approve, under the company's articles of association. Any shareholder taking
more than a 15 per cent stake in the company requires shareholder approval.
The problem for the government is that the sale of IPounds 150m of
government assets is a key factor in this year's Budget arithmetic, and upon
it hinges the government's ability to rescue Aer Lingus, the state-run
airline which is in the process of sorting out its own major financial
difficulties.
Aer Lingus is a major shareholder in GPA and along with GPA's other
shareholders is being called upon to subscribe to a new USDollars 200m
preference share issue by the aircraft leasing group.
The issue is seen as the company's last chance to avoid the banks taking
over effective control. Aer Lingus, however, is unlikely to be in a position
to subscribe to the issue without government finance.

Mr Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, called on the government

'action for jobs' programme.
He told Welsh Liberal Democrats in Brecon that a programme of public

thousands of contracts for small companies, particularly in local

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Go Voyages may cancel takeover
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GO VOYAGES, one of the largest French bucket shop travel companies, is
threatening to pull out of its long-running negotiations for a takeover by
Air France, the state-controlled airline.
Air France has for the past year been in discussions to buy Go Voyages, a
subsidiary of Garantie Mutuelle des Fonctionnaires, the French insurance
group. GMF is keen to withdraw from the travel sector and a year ago signed
a provisional agreement to sell Go Voyages to SOTAIR, the airline's travel
arm.
Mr Serge Fabre, chief executive of Go Voyages, said yesterday it would look
for other investors if Air France did not clinch the deal within a month.
Air France refused to comment. Earlier this year it announced plans for an
expansion of its travel activities by merging SOTAIR with the tour
businesses owned by Havas, the French media and travel group, and TUI, the
German holiday company.
Go Voyages has just emerged from a period in which it sustained heavy
losses. Mr Fabre yesterday said it had returned to the black in its last
financial year to October 31 when turnover rose to FFr378m from FFr366m in
the previous year.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Axel Springer gives up plans for
alliance in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AXEL SPRINGER Verlag, the German media group, and Poligrafici Editoriale,
the listed Italian newspaper concern controlled by the members of the Monti
family, have wound up their four-year attempt to create a closer alliance.
Springer has sold the 10 per cent stake it took in Poligrafici Editoriale in
June 1989, when the Italian company spent L160bn (Dollars 107m) to buy a
similar sized stake in its German counterpart. Separately, Poligrafici said
it had sold its 10 per cent stake in Springer for DM220m (Dollars 132.5m).
However, plans for closer co-operation, including an Italian language
equivalent of Springer's best-selling Bild Zeitung, never materialised.
Last year, Springer said it wanted to sell its Italian stake, but the
transaction has only took place this week.
The 10 per cent holding, worth L61.4bn, has been bought by Mediobanca, the
Milan-based merchant bank, at a price of L4,650 a share. That is appreciably
below the L5,505 at which Poligrafici shares were fixed on Tuesday, when the
deal took place.
The price represents a substantial loss, particularly in D-Mark terms, for
Springer, which bought its stake for about L70.6bn. According to Springer,
the sale followed its decision to concentrate on its traditional key
markets.
However, relations between the two companies have steadily deteriorated,
with the Italians complaining of insufficient involvement in decision making
at the German group. Last summer, Springer asked for the return of its
shares held by the Italians.
Brokers believe the Poligrafici shares bought by Mediobanca are unlikely to
be a long-term investment.
However, there remains considerable uncertainty as to where they may end up.
Banco Di Napoli, the large Italian bank which floated 20 per cent of its
ordinary shares in late 1991, has taken majority control of Isveimer, the
Naples-based public sector lending institution.
The acquisition, for a price which has not been revealed, marks a further
step in the gradual rationalisation of the Italian banking system and
erosion of divisions between different types of financial institutions.
Banco di Napoli owned over 45 per cent of Isveimer. The acquisition of a
further 6.1 per cent, lifting Banco di Napoli's stake to just over 51 per
cent, had taken place last year. This was formalised this week.
Isveimer, which is likely to keep its independence in the short term,
administers about L25,000bn (Dollars 16.8bn) in loans. Its other main
shareholder is Agensud, a state-owned body being closed down, whose stake in
Isveimer will be transferred to the Treasury.

ARES-SERONO, the Geneva-based drugs and diagnostics group, reported net
income up 51 per cent to Dollars 107.8m for the year to December 31 from
Dollars 71.2m.
The results, which included a Dollars 27m gain from the disposal of its over
the counter division, was achieved on sales up 16.7 per cent to Dollars 854m
from Dollars 732m. Excluding favourable currency, underlying sales growth
was 15 per cent.
Mr Fabio Bertarelli, chief executive, said the group had achieved strong
growth in spite of the turmoil of the European monetary system and pressure
on government reimbursement schemes.
Turnover of the ethical drugs division increased 20.4 per cent to Dollars
752m from Dollars 625m. The group said each of its main therapeutic areas -
infertility, immunology and paediatric endocrinology - increased sales by
more than 20 per cent over the year.
Sales of the diagnostics division fell 4.6 per cent to Dollars 101m from
Dollars 106m.
The company said that if the clinical chemistry sales were discontinued,
then diagnostic sales increased 5 per cent. Group capital spending increased
to Dollars 92.8m from Dollars 56.7m.
Earnings per share for continuing operations increased to Dollars 21.38 from
Dollars 18.66. The board recommended a dividend of SFr6.00 per bearer share
and SFr2.40 per registered share.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: New company seals Daf trucks
rescue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE rescue of the Daf medium and heavy truck operations in the Netherlands
and Belgium has been sealed with the official incorporation of the
recapitalised successor company, Daf Trucks.
The new company has a workforce of around 3,500, with 2,750 at Eindhoven in
the Netherlands, a few in sales and service elsewhere in Europe, and 750 at
Daf Trucks Flanders in Westerlo, Belgium.
When Daf collapsed into receivership last month it had a workforce of 12,650
including 5,500 in the UK, 5,000 in the Netherlands and 1,500 in Belgium.
Part of the top management is unchanged. Mr Cor Baan, chairman of the
management board of the failed Daf group, has been appointed president of
Daf Trucks, while Mr Rico Dietz, Daf director of product development is to
be Daf Trucks' operations director with responsibility for product
development and production.
Directors for finance and sales and marketing are to be appointed 'as soon
as possible', while the supervisory board is expected to be formed within
two weeks.
Daf Trucks said sales and service subsidiaries would be established in
several of the main west European markets with independent importers
appointed elsewhere.
The product range of the new company will be concentrated in the medium and
heavy duty sectors with the 65/75/85 series and the 95 series for long
distance haulage.
Daf Trucks said the possible inclusion of the UK-built Leyland Daf 45 light
truck in its range was 'under discussion'. Such a deal with Daf Trucks is
vital for the survival of the Leyland Daf truck assembly plant at Leyland in
the north of England where a management buy-out is being planned.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, who is battling to rebuild his
authority after months of bloody communal unrest, has sent Mr Sharad Pawar,
the defence minister, to take control of the local authorities in Bombay,
the city which bore the brunt of the violence.
Mr Pawar, who is from Bombay, resigned from the cabinet yesterday to become
chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes Bombay.
The move is being presented as an effort to bolster the state administration
with a strong and experienced leader who has held the job of chief minister
three times already.
But Mr Rao's decision is widely viewed as an attack on Mr Pawar, who sees
himself as a potential future prime minister. While Mr Pawar said he was
'happy to do my job as a disciplined soldier' of the ruling Congress (I)
party, his supporters did not hide their dismay.
Mr Rao's action follows weeks of turbulence in Congress party circles in
Bombay, which ultimately escalated to the point which forced him to impose
his authority or risk a local rebellion. The trouble began with a
long-running power struggle in Bombay between Mr Pawar and Mr Sudhakarrao
Naik, who was chief minister until he was forced to resign last month.
Mr Naik was in office during the riots which hit Bombay in December and
January after the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque. Mr Pawar persuaded Mr
Rao to get rid of Mr Naik - but, as it has turned out, this week, only at
the cost of his own cabinet job.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPLETE overhaul of Malaysia's electricity system has been proposed by a
British consultancy firm called in to examine increasing problems of power
supply in the country.
The UK-based National Grid Company made the recommendations in the midst of
what the government admits is a power crisis.
Late last year almost all of peninsula Malaysia was without electricity
supply for several hours after what the authorities said was a lightning
strike a power plant.
In recent weeks Tenaga Nasional, the recently partially privatised
electricity utility, has said power cuts have been occurring throughout the
country due to maintenance and upgrading work. It says full supplies might
not resume for some months.
Power supplies have failed to keep pace with demand as Malaysia's economy
has grown by more than 8 per cent in each of the last five years. Dr
Mahathir Mohamad, the prime minister, has ordered that restoration of full
power supplies be given top priority.
It is feared power shortages might deter foreign investors. Mrs Rafidah
Aziz, minister for trade and industry, says complaints from industrialists
has reached an 'intolerable' level.
Malaysia is at present allowing local and foreign concerns to build, own and
operate a number of power stations. Malaysia favours Russia's new offer for
jet fighter sales and has ordered a detailed study, Defence Minister Najib
Abdul Razak said. Russia is competing with the US to sell replacements for
ageing fighters.

<TEXT>
FRANCE'S beleaguered Socialist government yesterday ran into another scandal
when Liberation, the daily newspaper, claimed that President Francois
Mitterrand's security staff had in the mid-1980s illegally bugged a
journalist's telephone.
Liberation claims to have discovered security service transcripts of 16
phone conversations from the home of Mr Edwy Plenel, an investigative
journalist on Le Monde newspaper, between December 30 1985 and February 26
1986. Mr Plenel was at the time researching an article on the falsification
of evidence by the security services to convict three suspected Irish
terrorists. All three were later released.
The newspaper did not disclose its source for the documents, which bore the
signature of Mr Pierre-Yves Gilleron, a member of France's intelligence
service and a member of the cell in charge of the president's security. Mr
Plenel wrote in Le Monde that Mr Gilleron admitted to him having been
ordered 10 years ago to investigate whether Le Monde and Liberation
journalists working on the Irish case had been involved in any political
activities. President Mitterrand's staff refused to comment on the
Liberation article. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, said he had no
knowledge of the affair but expressed confidence that a law passed in 1991
had cleared up phone-tapping abuses.
Mr Plenel said on French radio that he would take legal action. Under French
law, the security services are only allowed to tap the telephones of
suspected terrorists.
Two prominent industrialists working for the government at the time both
denied any knowledge of a bug on Mr Plenel's phone.
Mr Louis Schweitzer, now chairman of Renault and then head of the private
office of Mr Laurent Fabius, prime minister, said his policy was always to
refuse requests to tap journalists' phones. The security services should
have cleared all bugging requests with Mr Schweitzer. Mr Gilles Menage, now
chairman of the EdF electricity group and then deputy director of Mr
Mitterrand's private office, denied any knowledge of the alleged bugging.

SLOVAK Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar has reiterated opposition to radical
economic reforms of the type embraced by the Czech Republic, and blamed its
reform programme for a decline in the Slovak economy, Reuter reports from
Bratislava.
Local media quoted Mr Meciar as having told a rally that 'Klaus reforms', a
reference to Czech Premier Vaclav Klaus, were unsuitable for Slovakia.
According to reports, Mr Meciar said that Mr Klaus's economic policies had
led to a 30 per cent decline in the Slovak economy. He said his government
would not devalue the Slovak crown, but he called for restrictions on
'non-essential' imports.
Mr Klaus introduced sweeping reforms when he became finance minister of what
was then the Czechoslovakian federation.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Slovakia waits for the fruits of independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO months into independence, Slovakia is looking for foreign capital to
revitalise one of the most distorted economies in the region.
It is not an easy task. The break-up of the former Czechoslovak federal
republic has already led to an unexpectedly sharp drop in trade between the
hitherto economically intertwined republics. At the same time, European
Community restrictions on steel exports have cut already dangerously low
foreign currency earnings at a time when ties with the east have dwindled.
A nationalist government with little experience of foreign relations and a
bureaucracy trained in Soviet methods is hard pressed to come up with
reliable statistics, let alone clear-cut policies designed to attract
foreign investment. Inexperienced ministers are overworked and bogged down
in detail as they grapple with complex regulatory, environmental and
financial issues.
It all seemed much simpler nine months ago when Mr Vladimir Meciar, leader
of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS), barnstormed this small
country with a promise to restore Slovak pride and dignity after 1,000 years
of foreign domination and 70 years as the junior partner in a federation
with the more sophisticated and populous Czechs.
What most Slovaks saw as a bid for greater autonomy within a looser
confederal relationship with the Czechs was interpreted by Mr Vaclav Klaus,
the Czech prime minister, as a bid for independence.
Working on the principle that a quick divorce was better than a disputatious
marriage, Mr Klaus insisted on rapid separation proceedings.
But independence, formally achieved on January 1, found Slovakia facing high
unemployment and the loss of an estimated Dollars 700m annual subsidy from
the Czech lands. Under the circumstances it also found itself facing
pressure for a devaluation which would further cut living standards of an
electorate told earlier that independence would bring prosperity.
The latest public opinion poll shows a sharp decline in the popularity of Mr
Vladimir Meciar, the prime minister, who also faces internal dissention
within the HZDS. Mr Meciar faces a challenge from Mr Milan Knazko, the
popular former actor who is now the foreign minister, and pressure from
opposition parties, especially the former communist Party of the Democratic
Left (PDL), led by Mr Peter Weiss, which are demanding seats in a future
coalition government.
Mr Meciar, a former boxer who became a lawyer and critic of the former
communist regime, remains the most powerful political personality. But an
air of desperation is beginning to creep into his speeches. At a recent
conference to attract international investors, he described Slovakia as 'a
country at the centre of Europe but virtually unknown'.
Slovakia needs support from the International Monetary Fund to reassure
investors and unblock institutional capital inflows. But initial talks broke
down in mid-February after the Slovaks refused to accept the IMF's
suggestion to float the Slovak crown.
Officially the Slovak crown remains on a par with the Czech crown. In
practice the Czechs demand a 20 per cent discount when changing the Slovak
currency, while the Slovaks, not to be outdone, insist on imposing a 10 per
cent discount on the Czech currency. Foreigners meanwhile are billed in US
dollars.
Slovakia disputes the veracity of IMF statistics which, they claim, were
prepared from information provided by Prague. Mr Julius Toth, the finance
minister, says it would be absurd to devalue before even knowing the true
trade and payments picture.
But a clearer picture of the government's concern was revealed when
importers asked when they would be allowed the foreign exchange required to
pay for their imports. It transpired that, with little fanfare, the
authorities have quietly blocked hard currency payments for undefined
non-essential imports and are preparing 'temporary' import barriers to
reduce strain on reserves.
'We are not looking for aid, but we must be able to increase our trade. If
the west closes its markets and increases Slovakia's economic and social
problems then the likelihood is that the present government, which is open
to trade and investment, could be replaced by a much more left-wing
government,' said Mr Lubomir Dolgos, the privatisation minister.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (10): Airlines get
a flying start - The advantages of using Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE international scheduled airlines which use Manchester airport say the
principal attraction is the population of about 20m people within two hours'
travelling time of the airport, many of whom are business travellers.
American Airlines, which claims to be the world's biggest airline with 86m
passengers carried in 1992, was the first US carrier to fly direct into
Manchester in 1986 and is very happy to be there.
It had been flying to Gatwick for four years. Route viability studies showed
there was a large potential market in the north of England.
Mr Iain Burns, spokesman for American Airlines, says: 'We realised there was
a huge untapped market of business travellers in the north of England. There
was, and still is, a pronounced feeling among businessmen in the north that
they should not have to travel to the US by way of London.'
American has one return flight a day to New York and one a day to Chicago.
It will be gaining some extra flights in the summer.
Mr Burns adds: 'The good communications around the airport are important.
One in four of our travellers come from Yorkshire to the east of Manchester.
The road network is good but business should grow further once the rail link
starts.'
American now flies to five destinations within the UK but Manchester to
Chicago is one of its most profitable routes. Mr Burns says: 'The attraction
of Chicago for the business traveller is that it is an important hub. New
York is essentially a point-to-point airport. From Chicago it is possible to
fly to 114 other destinations. Only 30 per cent of our passengers finish
their journeys in Chicago. The other 70 per cent fly on somewhere else.'
Delta Airlines, the world's third largest, is also happy with Manchester,
but for a different reason. It has managed to tap the UK leisure market.
Delta applied for and won a licence to fly into Manchester in June 1991. It
flies daily to Atlanta.
Ms Jennifer Smith, spokesperson for Delta, says: 'We were examining possible
routes into the UK. Research was carried out in London and Manchester. We
knew that American had done very well out of their Chicago flight and
decided to apply for a licence.'
Unlike American, however, Delta's passengers are not predominantly business
travellers. Ms Smith says: 'About 75 per cent of our traffic is leisure and
only 25 per cent business. Atlanta is a main hub. We estimate that 44 per
cent of passengers on the Manchester flight fly on to Florida.'
Delta is pleased with the Manchester operation. Ms Smith says: 'I have to
say we have done very well with this flight. It is very profitable. We
carried 136,000 passengers last year which means pretty full payloads. It
did not start quietly, then limp along and finally pick up. We have done
well from day one.'
At Cathay Pacific there is another perspective. It has three flights a week
to Hongkong. The key is, again, the catchment area.
Mr John Paterson, manager, Britain and Ireland, says: 'There is a huge
business catchment in the north of England. Many do not want the aggravation
of flying down to Heathrow and then on to Hongkong.'
He explains that the connections between Manchester and Gatwick are not good
and says: 'The problem of going via Heathrow is that you have to change
terminals and flights. From Manchester you can fly direct, with one stop in
Frankfurt.'
This means the minimum of disruption for travellers but also enables Cathay
to top up with passengers in Frankfurt. The full payloads mean the flights
are profitable. Cathay is stepping up its service to five flights a week in
July. It is hoping to run daily flights when it is allowed. Mr Paterson
says: 'Regular frequency is vital to gain business traffic. Once the the
businessman knows there is a daily flight he becomes seriously interested.'
Aer Lingus says Manchester is a vital destination for its short-haul
operations. The Irish airline flies to a number of UK airports including
Heathrow, Gatwick, Cardiff, Bristol and Birmingham.
The company believes Manchester is important because it is at the centre of
a large population
Mr Tony White, spokesman for Aer Lingus, says: 'There is a large
concentration of business travellers in the north of England. There is also
a large concentration of Irish people and Irish related people in the
north-west who want to travel to Ireland. Aer Lingus runs eight flights a
day from Dublin to Manchester.
He adds that Manchester is a good pick-up point for daily flights from
Dublin to Copenhagen and Zurich, the two European destinations to which Aer
Lingus flies.
BA Regional was set up last year to service flights from Birmingham,
Manchester and Glasgow. It serves, or will serve, after March, 18
international destinations as well as the full range of domestic routes.
Mr Douglas Jackson, a spokesman for BA Regional, says: 'Manchester is a
significant airport simply because there is the population to support it.
There are more people within 20 minutes of the airport than there are from
any other city with the possible exception of London.'
One offbeat service handled by BA Regional is a twice weekly run to
Islamabad. This starts life at Gatwick but picks up most of its passengers
at Manchester. It draws on the large Asian communities in the north of
England.
Mr Jackson says: 'These flights are usually full and very profitable.'

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (11): Ripples may
spread far and wide - The economic impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE seaports and railway termini before them, airports, as they develop,
can have a dramatic economic impact on the surrounding hinterlands.
Manchester is forecasting tens of thousands of jobs to be generated by its
growth.
How realistic is this? For example, Ireland's Shannon airport is often
quoted as a case of a small regional airport which drove and led economic
development.
The Airports Association Council International, which is a worldwide
association representing 150 airports, undertook a study in November 1992
which looked at the economic impact of airports.
It quotes the case of Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris. The authority
there employed 2,648 people in 1991 while 377 other enterprises on site
including airlines, public services, commercial operations and others
employed 34,184 people.
In that year, these nearly 400 enterprises paid gross salaries of FFr9bn
(Dollars 1.67bn), spent FFr7.1bn on goods, services, energy etc, made
capital investments of FFr2bn and paid local taxes of FFr200m.
Manchester airport is the third largest in Britain after Heathrow and
Gatwick. The airport has grown from 3m passengers a decade ago to 12.4m
passengers in 1992.
Mr Geoff Muirhead, the director of business development, says the reason for
the growth has been, essentially, the huge rise in air travel, domestic and
international, in the past decade plus the fact that Manchester has had a
large catchment, around 20m people, to take advantage of the growth. But, he
adds: 'I have to say we have been very good at going out and getting the
business.'
With the first phase of the Pounds 570m second terminal opening this month
and plans for a second runway in four years, the airport could be handling
30m passengers by 2005 and 247,000 tonnes of freight, compared with 80,000
tonnes in 1990.
Such expansion would have significant impact on the wider economy not just
of Manchester, but of the whole of northern England.
The main study undertaken so far on the economic impact of Manchester
airports growth is called Towards An Economic Strategy for The Manchester
Airport Area. It was prepared in May 1992 by York Consulting on behalf of a
joint study group comprising representatives from Manchester, Stockport,
Trafford, Cheshire, Macclesfield councils and the Manchester Airport
Authority.
The York report, as it is known, concerned itself with land availability and
need and the employment aspects of the airport's presence.
The report found between 15,000 and 25,000 jobs in the sub-region are the
result of the airport's presence. There were 23,000 directly employed at the
airport.
The report says: 'The total number of jobs is, therefore, some 38,000 to
48,000 or 3.5 per cent of employment in Greater Manchester and Cheshire.'
The document estimates if the airport grows as predicted, then 50,000 new
jobs could be created by 2005. Around half would be aviation-related.
The document says the importance of these jobs 'cannot be overstated. The
local and regional economy is under-represented in service industries though
potentially strong in manufacturing.'
Since the report was published the airport has extrapolated some figures of
its own and broken down the jobs into particular categories.
Ms Louise Congdon, general manager, market strategy, says: 'Our figures are
very tentative. KMPG Peat Marwick is engaged in an exercise for us at the
moment to take the report further and examine the economic impact of our
expansion.'
However, Ms Congdon's figures estimate that by 2005 there could be between
78,000 and 104,000 jobs in the sub-region because of the airport. About half
of these would be aviation related. The sub-region is Greater Manchester and
parts of Cheshire as far as Macclesfield to the south and Warrrington to the
West.
The figures are divided into five categories. Four are aviation-related. The
fifth is the 'catalyst effect'. This refers to companies being drawn to new
business parks because they are international concerns and need an airport
for frequently travelling executives, or they export high-value, low-volume
products.
The four aviation-related categories are: on-site, off-site direct, off-site
indirect, and off-site induced. Off-site direct refers to local services,
such as newsagents and bakers. Off-site indirect means hotels and tour
operators. Off-site induced means new enterprises such as restaurants and
sandwich bars.
All told there could be between 53,000 and 64,000 jobs in these categories
compared with 23,000 today.
The catalyst effect is the hardest to gauge, and could be where the greatest
growth will lie. Ms Congdon's projections estimate 25,000 to 40,000 jobs in
this category.
What is certain is there are a number of international concerns wanting to
be near an airport. Mr Steve Carr, the principal economic development
officer of Manchester City Council, cites the case of Siemens, which set up
a regional headquarters at Didsbury, two miles from the airport, and now
employs 1,000.
Mr Carr says: 'The main consideration for Siemens was the proximity of an
international airport. Executives are always flying off to Frankfurt.'
Quantifying this demand, however, is difficult. Mr Carr says the Manchester
City Council has never attempted to estimate the amount of investment that
could flow from the airport's growth. But, he says: 'Manchester has always
been under-represented with Japanese high-technology concerns. We are also
looking to draw in European agencies.'
Nor need investment necessarily be confined to the sub-region around the
airport: the Channel Tunnel has led local authorities not only in Kent -
where the tunnel will emerge - but also as far away as Essex, Southampton,
East and West Sussex, to look at their plans for business accommodation.
Similarly, councils in Merseyside, Cheshire, Lancashire and even North Wales
and Yorkshire are examining the potential to attract investors because of
the airport. The ripples from the airport's growth could spread widely.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (9): Marketing man
reaches for the sky - Profile, Gil Thompson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST British airport chief executives used to have military or air traffic
control backgrounds. When Gil Thompson left British Airways to take over
Manchester Airport, he says he was the first marketing man in such a job.
That was 12 years ago. He was 51 and had been with BA for 31 years, ending
up as northern manager. What he has done since has been acknowledged as an
amazing feat of marketing management, with a trebling of passengers carried
and Manchester's emergence as Europe's fastest-growing airport.
Mr Thompson got his market research into shape, then used the results to
sell to the airlines. The crucial leap of management thinking was to regard
the airlines and tour operators as the airport's primary customers, rather
than passengers and freight forwarders.
The latter have not been neglected - far from it, he says - but the prime
movers of growth are airlines. As events have proved, passengers then come
in a rush once there are aircraft available.
'Although we say it ourselves, no other airport is better at research than
Manchester,' Mr Thompson says. 'We have worked hard to establish how many
passengers in our catchment area travel to various overseas destinations
through an intermediate point, such as Heathrow or another European airport.
'Armed with such information, we will go to an airline and say, 'Did you
know there were 50,000 passengers a year flying between Manchester and your
home base?'
'We have then been able to prove from our experience here that if that
airline were minded to fly direct, it would carry at least 50 per cent more.
Chicago is a case in point: there were 40,000 when American Airlines
started, then 60,000, then 80,000, then 90,000 and now it's 130,000 people.
Manchester regards its main catchment area as the 20m people within two
hours' driving time, of whom more than half can get there in around an hour
or less. Having to travel to Heathrow - or, worse, Gatwick - to catch a
flight, does not impress northerners, because of the cost and inconvenience
involved.
Indeed, many business travellers have long used Amsterdam, Copenhagen,
Frankfurt and Zurich to change aircraft, rather than London, flying from
Manchester or another northern airport offering a connection.
The breakthrough for Manchester in proving the strength of northern demand
was Qantas's service to Australia in the mid-1980s. Market research showed
at least 50,000 northerners travelling to Australia via other airports.
Qantas decided to test the water. 'They got 28,000 in the first year; now
it's up to 75,000,' Mr Thompson says. 'They proved that the northerner
rewards the airline that flies to his doorstep. Our research shows that if
airlines come in here, people will move their itineraries around to use the
services.'
Some opponents of Manchester's expansion point out that Qantas, and other
long-haul carriers, do not fly full from Manchester, but have an early first
hop - say to London, Amsterdam, or Frankfurt - to top up with passengers.
Manchester argues this matters little, because of the considerable
improvement in convenience. Passengers do not disembark, thus avoiding the
disruption of transit - such as changing airlines and terminals and having
to allow enough extra time to make connections.
Transatlantic services, however, are non-stop and are saving tens of
thousands of people from the extra cost and time of shuttling to Heathrow or
elsewhere to catch planes to New York, Chicago or Atlanta. From next month,
British Airways will add Los Angeles to its north American routes from
Manchester.
Moreover, competition is stimulating these long-haul direct markets even
further. Mr Thompson says: 'When American Airlines started a daily service
to New York - as BA already offered - BA was afraid it would halve the cake.
'What has it done? It has doubled the traffic. Instead of 100,000 passengers
a year to New York from Manchester, there are now 200,000.
'Our research has shown that direct, particularly non-stop services,
multiply the traffic. We are not in the business of putting airlines on the
margin by trying to cut the cake into too many small slices. They know now
we have proved it.'
Many northerners are grateful to foreign airlines for taking up Manchester's
offers of facilities, for BA inevitably also has an interest in flying
passengers through Heathrow, using its Manchester shuttle, to fill its
jumbos there. This can conflict with opting for a new Manchester service.
'It hasn't always suited BA's purpose to come to us,' Mr Thompson admits.
'That's understandable. When you have a hub the size of London - and BA has
over 50 per cent of the traffic there - they would want to feed traffic to
their 747s at Heathrow.
'We are as patriotic as anyone. Whenever we have established what we think
will be a viable route, we have always shared our figures with the national
carrier first of all. Only when they have been unable or unwilling, have we
gone overseas.'
His background with BA and in marketing has proved invaluable. 'What I found
soon after I started here was that the airlines like to talk to their own
people. I knew the language and that proved a great asset. I also talked to
them as a customer trying to serve their customers, not as a landlord,' Mr
Thompson adds.
He has also promised incoming carriers to widen Manchester's catchment area
by providing more feeder services from around the UK. 'Six years ago we
started to attract passengers from all over the UK. We have developed
Manchester as a major hub now. There are now more domestic passengers
feeding Manchester as a hub than any other airport in the country, including
London,' Mr Thompson says.
'We have 19 domestic routes. Six years ago only 2 per cent of our turnover
was transfer business, now it's 7 per cent. That means 250,000 extra
passengers, mainly to long-haul carriers, such as American to Chicago, Delta
to Atlanta, or Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong. This is the top-up traffic we
promised them when they started these long-haul services.
'It's expensive to do in terms of handling and usage of the runway because
we are using up slots we should have for larger aircraft, but it's
investment in the future to be a hub rather than an airport that flies from
point to point.'
He is now working on Japanese inward investors, who have been meeting in a
group led by Sharp, which has its UK headquarters in Manchester. 'We have
told Sharp that we can prove that the growth in passengers carried will be
50 per cent in the first year if a Japanese carrier flew direct from
Manchester. Then it will go up to 100 per cent, then 200 per cent.'
He hopes Japanese companies in the UK will help argue the case for
Manchester-Osaka direct service to All Nippon Airways, filling one of the
intercontinental gaps.
He will not see it in as chief executive, because he plans to retire. 'You
can really see only 10 years ahead,' he says. 'I think it would be totally
wrong for me to start off something I could not finish.'
Few believe he will be allowed to disengage totally, so that some sort of
non-executive involvement will be offered. Mr Thompson worries about this:
'One thing at a time. I think we would need to consult the new chief
executive. I would not want to get under his feet. I have heard of people
who found it hard to give up. If the company thinks I can be of use, then
since I believe in and love this airport, I should give it all I can. But I
don't intend to hang in if I'm not wanted.'

AN irresistible force is about to collide with an immovable object. The
growth of Manchester Airport may well seem market-driven and inexorable but
two strong groups have now emerged to try and limit it.
Something will have to give, but what exactly it will be will be decided at
ministerial level after a public inquiry, scheduled next year. Lobbying is
already intensifying.
Theoretically, Manchester Airport can grow to handle up to 24m passengers a
year by extending the new Terminal 2; it already has planning clearance for
this. The reality is that it will have difficulty in developing beyond 18m
passengers with only one runway.
This is because airports have early morning and evening rush hours like
anywhere else, particularly for short-haul traffic. Business travellers want
to get to mid-morning meetings throughout Europe without having to stay
overnight and want to return that evening. Airlines serving scheduled and
charter markets want their aircraft back again the same day.
Manchester's limit for air traffic movements is 42 an hour. On typical
summer days, morning and evening peaks can reach into the 30s. Moreover,
many involve relatively small aircraft because of Manchester's role as a hub
for feeder airports.
The airport wants a second runway to enable it to move up to 30m passengers
a year; it can only get it by encroaching on the Cheshire green belt.
Many people living in east Cheshire have therefore formed the Knutsford and
Mobberley Joint Airport Action Group (Kamjag), to fight the proposals. They
are against more noise, congestion and pressure in one of the most
salubrious corners of Britain.
They also believe they have ecology on their side because several local
sites of special scientific interest or biological importance might be
affected by the expansion plans.
Their campaign will certainly be well-argued. The area is one of the
northern equivalents of the Home Counties' stockbroker belt; the group is
well-funded, rich in professional talent, skilful, articulate,
well-organised, and well-connected. They also have a new ally in the shape
of Liverpool Airport, Manchester's poor relation. It has a runway capable of
taking almost any aircraft. This, Liverpool claims, is north-west England's
second runway.
Its problem is image and under-achievement. Bedevilled by local political
wrangling and consequent funding problems for much of the past three
decades, Liverpool airport struggled. Liverpool's finance and management are
now on an even keel because British Aerospace bought its way in, to share
ownership with the five Merseyside councils - Liverpool, Knowlsey, Wirral,
Sefton and St Helens - but in a dominant role.
Mr Cliff Duke, the chairman, is also director of aviation services for BAe.
He foresees an incremental expansion of Liverpool from 400,000 passengers a
year now to 12m by 2005 if Manchester fails to get its second runway.
Merseyside's political leaders are not only with him, they have stalled
agreement on airports strategy by the North West Regional Association of
local authorities, the majority of which favour Manchester's expansion.
Politically, the Merseysiders say, the effect of forcing growth at Liverpool
would be to spread the economic benefits - which it reckons at 1,000
permanent jobs per 1m passengers carried - where they are needed most.
Generally, the Merseyside economy so lags that of Greater Manchester its
leaders have applied to be ranked with Corsica by the EC to qualify for
special funds. Some of this would go towards the infrastructure that would
be needed to improve connections between Liverpool Airport and the motorways
and railways.
Mr Duke quotes Cheshire county council estimates suggesting 34,000 people
live within Liverpool Airport's noise contour, compared with 143,000 for
Manchester. Also, much of the Liverpool take-off zone is over water.
He foresees Liverpool and Manchester playing complementary roles, probably
with Liverpool getting mainly chartered point-to-point traffic, while
Manchester grows as a hub for scheduled services.
Liverpool claims travelling times would be identical for passengers coming
from north or south once motorway links are in place, with only 15 minutes'
extra driving from Yorkshire.
Kamjag's members have yet to decide their line, but Liverpool's arguments
will probably appeal. Mr Jeff Gazzard, a former marketing manager in
banking, is running the campaign almost full-time.
He says more than 70 per cent of Manchester traffic is outgoing holiday
business. He does not believe expansion would alter the split of business
and holiday traffic.
'There are 64 scheduled destinations, of which 14 are internal UK,' he says.
'It's not happened anywhere else in the world that a holiday airport has
turned those percentages round. Manchester should reflect our regional
commercial needs. It should not be the other way round - that we should bend
to the airport's'
The Liverpool proposal, however, would force airlines to fly there. Mr Jack
Flanagan, Manchester airport chairman, quotes 1991 research by the Henley
Centre for Forecasting which revealed airlines as 'highly resistant' to such
suggestions. The Henley research reported the belief of some airlines that
they might lose more than three-quarters of their Manchester business if
they were required to transfer services.
'From a passenger perspective and for the economic good of the region as
whole, it would be better to develop a second runway at Manchester, rather
than redevelop Liverpool as a major international airport,' it said.
Mr Flanagan says the north-west economy is of a similar size to those of
Greece, Denmark and Portugal, all of which can only support one
international gateway airport each, a role filled already by Manchester. He
thinks Liverpool's role could be complementary, but only if it bases its
plans on local, rather than regional or wider needs.
'Merseyside benefits substantially from access to world markets via the
Manchester gateway. However, only 10 per cent of Manchester airport's
traffic originates in Merseyside, compared with 20 per cent from east of the
Pennines. It is simply unrealistic to expect Liverpool - based on the
extreme west coast - to take over Manchester's role as a gateway.'
Mr Gil Thompson, Manchester's chief executive, says the figures speak for
the working of market forces. 'Leeds-Bradford is 750,000 passengers a year.
We are 12.5m. I wish Birmingham well, but they are 3.5m passengers a year,
Glasgow is 4.25m, Newcastle is 1m, East Midlands is 1m, Liverpool 400,000,
Blackpool around 200,000. We don't have a monopoly, but you can see the way
competition has worked.
'One in four of our passengers comes from Yorkshire, so when you talk of
using Liverpool, can you imagine a Yorkshire person driving past Manchester
to get to Liverpool? Even if they wanted to, you don't just go past a good
airport.
'You would have to spend Pounds 1.5bn to bring Liverpool up to our present
standards. There is civic pride involved, and I understand that. We
genuinely wish Liverpool well, but we see it growing as we grow.
'When we get our second runway - not if - there will be traffic which we
cannot handle or do not want. That should go to Liverpool. North-south
traffic on the west side of Britain can either go right or left where the
M62 or M56 crosses the M6. We are happy to assist as a sort of co-terminus,
trying to choose the traffic that will be best for both of us.'
Meanwhile, Manchester continues to research possible sites for its second
runway, hoping to find the one which will pose the least environmental
threat.
Kamjag's latest recruit as vice-president, Mr Terry Waite, does not even
live there, although he was born near the airport and has family in the
area. But he will ensure publicity against an airport team described by Mr
Gazzard as 'very skilled propagandists'.
Mr Waite succeeds Mr Neil Hamilton, the MP for Tatton - which includes
Knutsford. Mr Hamilton is the Department of Trade and Industry minister
responsible for north-west England. With the region's business lobby
generally favouring the second runway, his position was beginning to look
awkward, illustrating the delicate nature of what will be a very tough
decision for the environment secretary of the day.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (6): A site for
developers' eyes - The potential for property expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRPORTS act like honeypots for property developers. In Britain, the
evidence at Heathrow and Gatwick airports suggests that it is not only
aviation-related concerns which want to be close to them.
A corridor of computer companies has developed along the M4 motorway, which
runs past Heathrow, in places such as Reading and Swindon. In Crawley, next
to Gatwick, the old so-called metal-bashing companies have given way not
only to caterers and other airport-related concerns but also high-technology
companies.
The international dimension is important. It is significant that most of the
large electronics companies which established themselves along the M4 had US
parents. Executives flying in from the US wanted to be close to their
factories and to London.
Because its airport has climbed into the first division of international
hubs, Manchester has accordingly seen property developments springing up
around it.
Mr Peter Skelton, of estate agents and developers Lambert Smith Hampton,
estimates that more than 500,000 sq ft of new B1 office/light industrial
space has been built on business parks close to the airport in recent years.
These business premises include Kings Valley, a development financed by the
Co-operative Bank, the Concord Business Park which has been developed by St
Modwen, The Towers, a P&amp;O project, and Greencourts Business Park, which has
been brought on stream by Marples Developments.
Much of this newish business space is let. Clients at Greencourts include
Unilever's National Starch Division, Fisons pharmaceuticals and Microsoft.
At The Towers are to be found British Olivetti, Honeywell, Asea Brown Boveri
and Thorn EMI. Elsewhere there is Siemens, and on the Concord Park Mercury
Communications and Ferranti.
If other office premises in South Manchester - including the Manchester
Business Park which is a project Ringway Developments wants to develop - and
properties in places such as Stockport are included, then there has been an
availability of well over 1m sq ft of good quality B1-type space.
Much more space, however, is in the pipeline. The best known prospective
development is Davenport Green. This would be a project of 1m sq ft of high
quality B1-type offices built by Amec Developments. This would be on a site
of 80 acres opposite the airport, close to the M56 in between junctions 5
and 6.
Mr Ken Knott, the director of Amec in charge of the project, says: 'We have
not received planning permission yet but assuming all goes well we would
reckon to have the scheme in place by 1994.'
The problem close to the airport is the green belt. Planning permission from
Trafford Borough Council will neither be automatic nor uncontested. However,
Mr Knott says the 80 acres is only part of a tranche of 340 acres owned by
Amec. Land not used for buildings would be landscaped to try and enhance
present environmental standards.
Mr Knott says he knows of another scheme involving a different developer
which, again, would be of around 1m sq ft. It would differ from Davenport
Green in that it would also involve a hotel. This scheme, which is at a
tentative stage, would need approval by Manchester City Council.
Should the project go ahead the question arises whether the property market
would not go into a surplus, and depress prices. Greater Manchester as a
whole has become a smaller version of London. There is an overhang of new
B1-type properties of the kind that Amec is proposing to build close to the
airport.
Mr Skelton estimates that there is 1m sq ft of B1-type properties on the
market in Greater Manchester itself. He says that much of this is older
property which is not greatly in demand.
But to this total must be added the developments in Salford Quays. There,
during the late 1980s, a number of properties were built in two enterprise
zones to take advantage of tax concessions; just as in London's Docklands.
The projects include Exchange Quay, the Anchorage, Quay West and the
Harbour. They total around 1m sq ft. Only about a third of this is let, in
spite of incentives and low rents.
Can Greater Manchester absorb a further 2m sq ft of this type of property,
and hold rents at commercial levels?
Mr Alan Solomons, also of Lambert Smith Hampton, makes the point that very
little space either in Salford Quays or around the airport is of the B2
heavy industrial or B8 distribution or warehousing variety.
He says: 'There are few projects of the B8-type because the airport built
its own depot for handlers and distributors within its boundaries. This a
15-acre site and there does not seem to be much demand for further space of
this kind around the airport.'
Another reason is that there is not such a good return for B2 properties.
The land near the airport has become expensive - at least Pounds 500,000 an
acre. Developers would be looking for top rents to cover developments, at
least Pounds 20 per square foot.
The take-up of B1-property during the buoyant 1980s was 1m sq ft a year. Now
it is less than 500,000 sq ft a year. Rents in Salford Quays have been well
below Pounds 20 a sq ft.
Mr Knott is optimistic that Davenport Green will find tenants, although he
says that nothing will be built speculatively.
He says: 'I know Salford Quays is only 20 minutes from the airport as the
crow flies, and it is close to the city centre. But public transport is poor
and people cannot easily get there to work.
'Our project is right next to the airport. We would be targeting the top
layer of international companies - pharmaceutical and technology concerns.
There are about 200 of these. We would only need around 10 per cent of the
total.
'I am sure we will manage to achieve rents which are equivalent of Pounds 20
a sq ft today. We are building for the very top of the market,' he adds.
If there appears to be a demand for the 1990s, what are the prospects for
the more distant future?
The airport itself is looking forward to 2005 when its proposed second
runway will be operational.
A report by York Consulting for the airport and local councils has estimated
that the airport itself will need a further 48 acres for on-site activities.
There would be a need for 184 acres for aviation-related companies
The study found that the take-up of land from both on-site activities and
related aviation concerns was 104 acres.
Land supply, the study found among the councils of Stockport, Manchester,
Trafford, Macclesfield, Vale Royal, Halton and Warrington, was 1,777 acres,
or 11 years' supply.
These are crude figures. The airport impinges on some salubrious parts of
Cheshire. There will be conservation considerations. The airport, which has
prided itself on its accessibility does not want so much building close to
it that congestion turns passenger access into a problem.
However, should the demand for office space materialise there is clearly
enough land around, farther out, but near enough for most practicable
industrial and commercial purposes.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (5): Getting to
grips with income
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH there has been some study of the employment effect of having an
international airport at Manchester, little work has been done on the income
flows resulting from its presence. Virtually the only exercise undertaken
was by the economic development unit of the Manchester City council; but
this was in 1988.
Mr Steve Carr, the principal economic development officer attached to the
chief executive's office, was one of the authors of the study. He says: 'It
was a very simple and crude attempt to discover what the airport contributed
to the region.'
The paper divides income into five categories: procurement, remuneration,
tourism and business travel, capital projects and induced investment and
development.
Procurement: The paper found the average annual expenditure on goods and
services by companies based at the airport was estimated to be slightly in
excess of Pounds 100m. However, not all of this was spent in the Greater
Manchester area or in the wider north-west region. The 'leakage' outside the
area was up to 50 per cent. But some 5 per cent of goods and services were
obtained from outside the north west. The paper put the procurement income
at Pounds 54m.
Remuneration: The total wages bill for those employed at the airport was
found to be in excess of Pounds 70m. Not all of this wages bill found its
way into the Greater Manchester economy. Again, there was leakage outside
the area. The study estimated that the losses accounted for around 10 per
cent of the total wages bill. It put the remuneration effect at Pounds 63m.
Tourism and business travel: The estimated income gained by the Greater
Manchester area from spending by overseas tourists travelling through the
airport was put at Pounds 50m. It was possible, the study found, to
calculate the total direct and indirect effects of tourist spending in
Greater Manchester at Pounds 72m.
Capital projects: The income effect of the major capital projects at the
airport: the second terminal, the maintenance hangar and a reservations
office was put at Pounds 61m.
Induced investment and development: The location of the airport is thought
to have acted as a magnet for investment in the Greater Manchester area.
Inward, the industrial promotion agency for the north-west identified the
airport as one of the region's key attractions for investors and it became a
main plank in its marketing strategy.
However, apart from mentioning one or two individual investments such as the
Siemens Pounds 15m regional headquarters in Didsbury, the study did not
attempt to quantify the flow of inward investment. It says: 'There is
insufficient information available to attempt to quantify the proportion of
regional income and employment that has been induced by the airport's role
in the local economy.'
Therefore, the total income effect of the airport was Pounds 250m. Other
bits and pieces about income can be gleaned from different reports. For
example, a paper by the Airports Association International Council which
claims to represent 150 airports worldwide, says Manchester airport in 1991
contributed Ecu30m (Dollars 35m) in tax to the UK government.
Mr Carr says: 'At a rough guess I would imagine you would have to double our
figures for today. What is impossible to calculate is the amount of foreign
investment that might flow in as Manchester becomes a top international
airport. Much publicity has been given to the British Council moving to the
city centre and Siemens going to a business park close to the airport, but
these could be the tip of the iceberg.'

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (4): On track for
easier access - The approaches to an airport serving 20m people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EASY accessibility, with 20m people within two hours' driving, has been one
of Manchester Airport's main selling points. In contrast to the southern
international airports Gatwick and Heathrow, its approaches have not been
badly congested.
Outside the rush hours, it is an easy 20-minute drive from the centre of
Manchester to the airport. There is adequate parking there, and prices are
comparable with elsewhere.
Ms Louise Congdon, general manager in charge of market strategy at the
airport, says there is still a car-to-aircraft time of only 20 minutes for
domestic flights.
For international flights, with passport control and security, it takes a
little longer. But passage from the car park through the airport is
considerably quicker than in the vast, sprawling Heathrow complex.
However, Manchester's great weakness has been the lack of a rail link. At
the moment the airport can be reached only by road. It is estimated that
more than 70 per cent of all journeys to the airport are by private car, the
rest by bus or taxi.
As air traffic grows and the airport expands pressure would have built up
not only on the approach roads but also on the car parks.
It was recognised some years back that a rail link would be necessary to
alleviate this pressure. The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport
Authority, which runs the county's public transport, applied to the
Department of Transport in 1989 to build a rail link.
Building started in 1990 and the service will start operating in May, two
months after the opening of the first phase of the airport's second
terminal. The rail link has cost Pounds 28m to build including rolling
stock. Fifty-five per cent of the cost was met by British Rail and the
remaining 45 per cent from the GMPTA.
The line is a double track rail link and not a metro. It will use mainly
existing track although a new 2.64km spur has had to be built.
There will be four trains an hour to the airport, two of them shuttles from
Manchester Piccadilly. The shuttles will stop at four stations between
Manchester and the airport and take 22 minutes. They will leave at 10
minutes and 40 minutes past the hour during the day.
In between, will be two express trains. One line will originate at
Scarborough and run through Leeds. It will stop at Manchester and then
without further stops will go on to the airport. The travel time from
Manchester to the airport will be 17 minutes. Leeds will act as a hub for
Humberside.
The other line will start in Blackpool and run through the conurbations of
Preston, Blackburn and Burnley. Again, it will stop in Manchester and then
with one further stop go on to the airport. There is already a fast train
service from Merseyside into Manchester.
The whole of the north of England will therefore be covered, with a total
catchment of 20m people. Apart from the four trains an hour during the day,
there will be one an hour during the night.
Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive says it expects 10,000
people will travel on the service each day. The GMPTA was keen to build the
rail link not only because of the airport but because it represents new
business for the GMPTA.
The missing link in the rail network will be to the south. It will remain
difficult to get to the airport from areas such as Crewe or Stoke without
cumbersome changes in which passengers will have to handle their baggage.
The GMPTA says there is a plan to build a new spur which will tie the
airport directly into a rail line running to Crewe. This spur would only
need to be a quarter of a mile long and would mean that there would be a
feeder from the main west coast line directly into the airport and journeys
into Manchester could be avoided. However, the new spur is still at the
planning stage.
As for roads, the main development to come is the completion of the motorway
box around Manchester from Denton to Middleton. This is expected to be
finished by 1995 and will mean that the conurbations to the east in West
Yorkshire, most notably that of Leeds-Bradford, will be 20 minutes closer to
the airport. This will put Leeds within 45 minutes travel time, or about the
same as Merseyside.
Under consideration is the Greater Manchester West and Northern Relief Road.
This would be a trunk route around the conurbation linking the M62, with the
M56 and the M6. Also under consideration is the widening of these three
motorways. This will ease existing access to the airport.
To the north there is also a proposal to extend the M58 to link up with the
M61 near Wigan.
As with rail, the weak link in the road network would be to the south and
south-west because of overcrowding on the M6, particularly in the peak
summer months. South Yorkshire and the East Midlands also have access
problems because of the lack of an all-weather dual carriageway between
Sheffield and Manchester.
Pressure is mounting on the government to address both these problems - and
not only because of access to the airport, although this is now a principal
reason advanced by business lobby groups, including the Coalfield
Communities Campaign in South Yorkshire, for improving the roads.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (3): Testing time
for new technology has arrived - A look at the nuts and bolts of the new
terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BASIC specification of Manchester's new Terminal 2 was simple: it had to
be able to take eight fully-laden Boeing 747 jumbo jets, wingtip to wingtip
on its apron, and be able to deal with all 4,000 people aboard them if they
all arrived or departed together.
Translating this into reinforced concrete and the systems to go with it has
produced something overwhelming. It cost Pounds 265m. At 1m sq ft, Terminal
2 is one of the largest single buildings in Britain. The whole site area is
1m sq metres, enough for 200 soccer pitches.
It contains 35 miles of pipework, enough to stretch to Liverpool, and 125
miles of telecommunications wiring, enough to reach Carlisle; 13,000 cubic
metres of concrete were used in the foundations; the 17,000 pieces of
structural steelwork it consumed weigh 10,000 tonnes and comprised 1 per
cent of the UK production of the same in 1989-90.
A normal mix of large and small aircraft using the terminal, would enable 14
of them on the apron at once. The departure areas have more than 3,000
seats. There are nine restaurants, cafes or bars - and 38 blocks of toilets.
The view down the length of the building from the inside is 614 metres long.
Basically, the terminal has a large central core, with two arms stretched
out straight on each side of it. The adjustable bridges to the doors of the
aircraft that will use branch off the arms.
Each arm has two floors, a lower one for arriving passengers, the upper for
those departing, so there is complete segregation. On each floor, moving
walkways will minimise the exercise involved in getting between the central
core and the gates to the aircraft.
Baggage handling and sorting systems are the latest. 'They are fully
automatic,' says Mr Howard Shiplee, head of the Amec team which managed the
terminal's construction. 'Bar code readers can read the code on a luggage
label from any angle, including upside down, with a very high level of
success and send it to the appropriate tray. It cost Pounds 48m, but it is
state-of-the-art.
'One of our big challenges was that standards change and improve
continuously. It's not just equipment, but statutes and regulations. We left
as much fitting out as late as possible because we wanted to meet the latest
level of technology and regulations. We have done many things at the last
minute that we are sure the people who use this terminal will appreciate.
About one third of the terminal is taken up with offices and support
services. Indeed, it comprises a community in its own right, with its own
gas-fired power station and a waste heat recovery system to service the
whole airport and take it off the national grid.
Airlines have been keen to become users, although British Airways will stay
in Manchester's Terminal 1. Most long-haul flights, however, will be at
Terminal 2, including those of Air Canada, American Airlines, Cathay
Pacific, Delta, Emirates, Gulf Air, Pakistan International, Qantas,
Singapore Airlines and South African Airways. Other regular users will be
Turkish Airlines, Air Malta, Air 2000, Britannia Airways, Cyprus Airways and
Euro Cypria.
Between them they will be able to handle 6m passengers a year. Because the
terminal has been built to have extra sections built on to one end, it can
be expanded to double this figure as demand grows.
In spite of these large numbers of potential users, however, it is unlikely
they will feel hemmed in. In the central departures area the overall
impression is of space, with high ceilings and plenty of floor area. Even
Sir Alan Cockshaw, Amec's chairman and an airports veteran in terms of both
using them and building them, is moved by it.
'It's beautiful, this. It really is magnificent. There's nothing in Terminal
4 at Heathrow to compare. You just don't get this sort of space in airports
generally,' he says.
The proof, however, will come when real passengers start using it in large
numbers, putting uneven and variable loads on the heating and ventilating
system, and experiencing at first hand whether the luggage label bar code
readers can do better than those at their supermarkets, which occasionally
miss.
All has gone well for Terminal 2 so far, thanks to human brains and hands.
Making it all work properly when the paying customers are subjecting it to
commercial demand, however, will require a different type of management -
service. The real test, therefore, starts now.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (2): Triumph for
design-and-build - The method used to build Terminal 2
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of its size and complexity, Manchester Airport's Terminal 2 was not
only completed on time, but sufficiently under budget for two optional
extras to be added at no extra cost - a new short-term car park and a steel
and glass canopy along the length of the terminal's set-down area.
The outcome is being seen as a vindication of design-and-build management
techniques. Increasingly, these are challenging the traditional way in which
large construction projects have been run in Europe - and in Britain in
particular.
Traditionally, buildings are designed by architects for clients and built by
contractors. There is clear demarcation of functions and responsibility,
with many potential areas where communications can break down.
Design-and-build puts all three parties - designers, client and contractors
 -into a single, interacting team. In this case the architects were Scott
Brownrigg &amp; Turner, the client was the airport and the contractors were
managed by Amec.
Once broad specifications have been agreed, construction can begin before
detailed design is completed.
As building progresses, practical factors concerning how best to do the
various jobs involved can be fed back to the designers.
Designs can therefore be improved as the job proceeds. If the technology of
some particular equipment is in a state of flux, plans can be varied to
ensure only the very latest is incorporated. Terminal 2's baggage handling
systems were a case in point.
Above all, however, design-and-build means that costs can be controlled on a
day-to-day basis.
In this case, Amec, the civil engineering and construction group headed by
Sir Alan Cockshaw, was in charge, managing the project for Manchester
Airport, which was always closely involved in design and specification.
Amec was not allowed to use its own contracting subsidiaries on the work,
thus leaving the company free to concentrate on managing the project without
any risk of conflict of interest.
The triumph involved in keeping such a complicated undertaking to time and
under budget is therefore Amec's. The company already had a good name for
reconstructing Terminal 3 at London Heathrow.
Sir Alan now hopes the Manchester showpiece will lead to much more airport
business for the group worldwide.
Mr Howard Shiplee, Amec's man responsible on the ground, had 110 colleagues
from the group to help him manage a total site workforce of about 1,500
people employed by 130 contractors. He reckons three times that number were
engaged off-site in prefabrication of things such as steelwork and
components of all sizes - from heating and ventilating plant to hundreds of
thousands of square metres of carpet.
'Our job was to procure, organise and control those 130 contractors in every
respect. We are very pleased that only three have gone down in the
recession.
'The reason is we worked hard in selecting them, making sure we had the
right price, the right programme, the right value for money and the right
people.
'We interviewed about 700 companies. We met the directors, the people who
were going to actually do the job and went deeply into everything. All this
has paid dividends,' Mr Shiplee added.
Design-and-build meant that the shell of the building was built long before
the interior was designed.
Sir Alan says: 'What people don't realise about a modern airport terminal
building is that it isn't really a building.
'Only 20 per cent of the cost is in the building. The real money - and what
makes the place work - is in the sophisticated information systems, security
systems, heating, ventilating, all the mechanical and electrical engineering
that goes into these things.'
An example of design-and-build at work was the method of attaching tens of
thousands of wall panels, which the contractors worked out could be done at
a third of the cost by changing the design. 'It's saving on lots of small
things like this that brings you in under budget in the end,' Sir Alan adds.
The management process itself becomes complex, however, as the project
almost assumes a life of its own, as Mr Shiplee points out.
'The design team undertook the overall design, but much detail was done by
our contractors,' he says. 'To put that into context, we have had more than
750,000 drawings in circulation over the last four years. One of the biggest
challenges has been to control the paper and the logistics. All our planning
has been computer-based.'
But he never underestimates the human factor. 'At the end of the day, you
still get down to the guys doing the job on site. We have been very
fortunate here because very many of them are going to use this terminal as
passengers.
'This has made a difference to attitudes. They are very proud of their work
and want to feel people will appreciate the quality. They will show their
kids what they did when they pass through the terminal on their holidays.
They will have a right to feel very pleased with themselves,' Mr Shiplee
adds. Sir Alan is also pleased that most of 130 contractors were based in
the UK and most from north-west England. 'It's a tremendous advertisement
for what the north can do for itself,' he says.
Tenders were open to all-comers and some were won by overseas companies, but
there was no sudden lurch in the UK's negative trade balances because
someone specified a fancy type of cladding that could only be bought abroad.
Sir Alan says: 'We have had no major hitches. There have been arguments, as
with any project, but everyone has worked to common objectives. I see
Terminal 2 as a tremendous advertisement for UK plc and the north-west in
particular. It reflects well on everyone who has had anything to do with
it.'
His unstinting praise, however, goes to Amec's client, Manchester Airport.
'The vision of the airport, for having the guts to commit to the terminal
when times were not good, can only be admired. At a time when everyone was
switching capital expenditure off, these fellows were saying go, go.
'We have come in within budget and we handed over the building four years to
the day after we started on it, as we contracted to do. We have shown what
can be done.
'What people are increasingly realising is that you can't separate the
design and construction processes. If you want the most cost-effective and
time-effective high quality product, you have got to get the designers and
constructors working closer together. That's the way you save time and
money.'
Terminal 2 is now likely to be Amec's testimonial when it bids for other
airport contracts around the world. Sir Alan hopes to be able to take a lot
of UK contractors with him.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Survey of European Airports - Manchester (1): A giant step
for the north - During the past eight years Manchester airport has become
the starting point for more than 12m travellers flying around the world. As
the Pounds 265m Terminal 2 opens today, Ian Hamilton Fazey traces the growth
of this new international hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS could be Manchester's year. The city is bidding strongly for the 2000
Olympics and will host the second world Earth Summit this summer. Today, it
inaugurates a new Pounds 265m terminal at its airport, itself a symbol of
economic resurgence.
The terminal will become operational in three weeks after trials. It should
mark a great leap forward, not only for Greater Manchester - the 10 boroughs
of which own the airport - but for most of northern England, north Wales,
and much of the Midlands.
The airport's emergence in the past seven years has been startling. If it
ever rivalled the comparably ambitious airports of Birmingham and Glasgow,
it left them trailing in the 1980s after government designation as the UK's
northern hub and international gateway.
This has meant that while Birmingham and Glasgow are each still climbing
towards 5m passengers a year, Manchester passed 12.4m in 1992.
It was at 4.4m in 1980 but the big surge in growth came from 1985 onwards,
after it had done market research and taken the findings to the airlines.
The argument was simple: tens of thousands of northern people were being
forced to travel to London to catch international flights, with considerable
waste of time and money. Why should they not fly from Manchester Airport,
which - because of the motorway network - is almost at the road travel 'time
centre' of Britain?
The 'time centre' argument is strong. The M6 and M62 motorways cross at
Warrington, about 15 minutes from the airport via the M56, on which the
airport lies. The exact time centre is near Knutsford, a pretty Cheshire
village almost under the airport's take-off flight-path.
Nor was the argument new: Warrington New Town built up a large national
distribution industry, with acres of warehousing and thousands of jobs in
the 1970s and 1980s by claiming to be at the centre of Britain.
A circle of 220 miles radius drawn on the junction of the M6 and M62 takes
in 97 per cent of the British population, including Glasgow, Edinburgh,
London, Southampton, Bristol and Cardiff.
'About 20m people live within two hours' drive of the airport and 60 per
cent of all UK manufacturing is within three hours,' says Gil Thompson, the
chief executive. 'We are a nation in our own right up here and events have
proved us quite capable of supporting an international hub airport.'
Some international carriers such as Qantas and Cathay Pacific stop elsewhere
to top up after starting at Manchester, but passenger convenience is greatly
improved by not having to change aircraft at London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt,
Paris or Zurich.
Transatlantic services to New York, Chicago, Atlanta, or Toronto are
non-stop and up to an hour faster than using London Heathrow because of the
shorter distance and lower level of air traffic congestion. A new weekday
service to Los Angeles starts next month.
All carriers have been pleased with the results, with passengers carried
increasing yearly. When American Airlines started a daily service to New
York in competition with British Airways, BA feared it might halve the cake;
instead, it doubled it.
Sir Alan Cockshaw, chairman of Amec, the Cheshire-based construction and
civil engineering group, says: 'The north needs this quality of airport.
Heathrow is a block. If you come back from the US to here, you can do it in
five-and-a-half hours from New York. The more long-haul flights we can get
into Manchester, the better it will be for business north of Birmingham.'
Manchester's figures show the strength of the market. In 1985, the airport
had 2.4m scheduled passengers, 3.7m chartered, and 114,000 in transit,
totalling 6.2m. Last year there were 4.8m scheduled, 6.9m chartered, and
747,000 in transit, totalling 12.4m.
The three categories grew by 100 per cent, 88 per cent and more than 500 per
cent respectively over eight years. Mr Thompson says the growth in transit
passengers is proving Manchester's strength as a hub.
'There are now more domestic passengers feeding Manchester as a hub than any
other airport in the country, including London,' he says. 'We have 19
domestic routes. Six years ago, only 2 per cent of our turnover was transfer
business, now it's 7 per cent.
'That means 250,000 extra passengers, mainly to long-haul carriers, such as
American to Chicago, Delta to Atlanta, or Cathay Pacific to Hong Kong. This
is the top-up traffic we promised them when they started these services.
'We feed them in from places such as Dundee, Edinburgh, Exeter, Southampton,
Belfast, Cardiff and Newcastle. It's expensive in terms of handling and
usage of the runway because we are using up slots we would otherwise have
for larger aircraft, but it's our investment in the future - to be a hub,
rather than an airport that flies from point to point.'
Not everyone is happy with Manchester's development, including many
inhabitants of Knutsford and its neighbouring village of Mobberley.
Mr Jeff Gazzard, leader of Kamjag - the Knutsford and Mobberley Joint
Airport Action Group - says much of Manchester's non-hub business in the
chartered and holiday tour traffic markets could be pushed elsewhere, so
that Manchester would not need a second runway to cope with forecast levels
of growth to 2005.
Merseyside's political leaders agree with Kamjag, and say if north-west
England needs a second international-standard runway, there is no need to
build it at Manchester - or rather in Cheshire's green belt - because there
is already one at Liverpool, 30 miles away.
For Manchester, however, the 55/45 split between chartered and
scheduled-plus-transit passengers is not the issue. Each comes with the
other, forming a critical mass in the market place that attracts airlines
and establishes the airport as a centre of excellence in operations,
maintenance and as a focal point for growth.
One in four passengers comes from Yorkshire, a proportion that should
increase when the motorway is completed around Greater Manchester in about
1996, shortening travelling times from Leeds to about 50 minutes.
Mr Thompson cannot see them driving on to Liverpool, although he supports
Liverpool having a complementary role, possibly as a co-terminus for holiday
traffic from west of the Pennines. Merseyside, however, which is Greater
Manchester's economically poor relation, wants air traffic growth spread
more evenly to balance the benefits.
The issue will be decided by the government after a public inquiry next
year. Manchester will have a powerful argument: the airport is one of
northern England's most powerful economic generators; capping its growth
when it runs out of runway capacity at 18m passengers would knock on
everywhere.
The second runway will have wide support. Throughout the 1980s, the Northern
Consortium - a transpennine grouping of all local authorities  -
consistently pushed for the airport's development so the north could gain
the economic benefits of growth. Only the five Merseyside authorities are
preventing consensus in the North West Regional Association of councils.
Northern business also supports strongly the second runway, as well as
wanting improved links by road, rail and air to speed up business travel to
Manchester. Moreover, the airlines also want to grow together in one place.
Manchester is used by 94 airlines serving 165 destinations. Scheduled
traffic should now grow faster, with opportunities to start new routes in
Europe, following the arrival of the single market and the deregulation that
has come with it.
The evidence is that regional hub airports have a developing role in air
transport as places like Heathrow become more congested. They also have an
economic and social impact on their hinterlands that are important forces in
reconstructing regional economies.
Manchester has not been Europe's fastest-growing airport for the past five
years by accident.
It is fast closing on London Gatwick's throughput of around 19m passengers
and a second runway would take it to 30m, compared with Heathrow's 40m now.
There could also be 50,000 new jobs by 2005.

FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays results fail to upset
equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRULY terrible results from Barclays and the absence of a rate cut from the
Bundesbank threw cold water yesterday over the London stock market's moves
to new peaks. However, share price losses were modest and the Footsie held
on to the 2,900-plus territory in a session showing every sign of a
consolidation phase.
At the day's low the Footsie brushed against 2,904.4, still several points
above the previous trading high set on Wednesday. The FT-SE 100 Index closed
13.8 off at 2,904.8, with the heavy fall in Barclays finally accounting for
just over 4 points of the setback.
The dividend cut and very heavy debt provisions by the bank dealt a severe
blow to the share price. The effects were muted to some extent by immediate
suggestions by sector analysts that either Barclays shares were a buy at
last night's close or that investors should switch into other UK bank
stocks. Extremely heavy volume in Barclays shares made up nearly 8 per cent
of total equity turnover.
Stocks opened lower, slipping back in the face of a weaker pound and
Barclays' results. The market steadied, however, and it was not until the
Bundesbank policy meeting had come and gone that share prices began to sag.
At worst the Footsie was down by 16.1 but selling was slight and strategists
were cheered to see the 2,900 mark well held.
Underlying optimism ahead of the UK Budget on March 16 was reflected in
renewed demand for the second line stocks. The FT-SE Mid 250 Index climbed
10 points to an all-time high of 3,087.9.
However, trading in non-Footsie stocks remained relatively light,
constituting only about 58 per cent of the day's Seaq volume of 660.1m
shares. On Wednesday, Seaq turnover of 710.6m translated into Pounds 1.48bn
of retail business.
The absence of the rights issue predicted at the close of the previous
session brought only brief respite. There were stronger rumours last night
that a company in the Footsie list planned an equity funding move today.
The satisfactory reception for equity rights issues over the past fortnight
was reinforced yesterday by dis-closure of a 93 per cent-plus take-up for
Commercial Union's rights offer.
With downside pressures on the market offset to some extent by the switching
within the banking sector and also by further strong US demand for ICI
shares, most of the leading blue chips stayed close to overnight levels.
Oil issues, having had a good run over the past few sessions in London,
settled easier yesterday following a cool per-formance from Wall Street,
both overnight and in early trading in the new session; the Dow Industrial
Average was down 8 points in UK dealing hours.
Poor results and workforce lay-offs at Philips Electronics had only marginal
effect in London. Store and retail issues were a shade easier but confidence
in a cut in base rates at Budget time remained solid and there were few
sellers of these interest rate-orientated stocks.
Across the range of the market, analysts remained confident that the move to
new peaks on the London stock market was justified by expectations of lower
interest rates in Europe and the expectation of a recovery in the British
economy.

FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Racal strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recommendations by at least two broking houses, coupled with a reportedly
very successful presentation to institutional investors hosted by NatWest
Securities, saw Racal Electronics shares burst through the 200p barrier to
gain 15 for a record close of 205p.
The day's turnover of 9.9m was the heaviest this year. The shares also
benefited from somewhat dubious takeover stories, with GEC suggested as a
possible bidder.
The electronics team at Credit Lyonnais Laing highlighted potential for
Racal from the recovery in the US datacommunications industry, also pointing
out that export order intake is rising at Racal's Radio and Decca divisions.
Kleinwort Benson was also believed to have been a keen buyer of Racal.
News of an oil discovery - thought to contain between 250m and 500m barrels
of oil - by BP and Shell, West of the Shetlands, came after market hours and
therefore failed to impact on the participants. BP eased a shade to 288p
although turnover remained exceptionally heavy and reached 12m. Shell eased
4 to 574p on 3.4m traded, with dealers talking of switching out of the
majors and into the exploration and production stocks.
In the latter, Enterprise Oil edged up 2 to 478p. Lasmo eased 3 to 182p,
although there were renewed hints that another asset disposal could be on
the cards.
The BP/Shell news could well influence shares in Aran Energy and British
Borneo which hold stakes of 10 per cent and 3.6 per cent respectively in
Block 205/26, adjacent to the BP/Shell discovery and which contains an oil
find made last year by Amerada Hess. Aran was unchanged at 25 1/2 p and
British Borneo 4 firmer at 178p.
Monument Oil &amp; Gas moved up 1 1/4 to 41 1/2 p, with one leading UK
securities house, thought to be Smith New Court, said to have bought a block
of 6m shares.
Shares in conglomerate Williams Holdings shed 5 to 355p on turnover of 5.5m
after it announced a placing of 11.8m shares at 345p.
The Pounds 44m rights issue by housebuilder Berkeley Group, the second such
fund raising by the company in three years, took the market by surprise,
although the buildings sectors are seen as prime candidates to raise capital
via the rights issue path. Housebuilder Bellway recently launched a Pounds
33m rights issue.
Berkeley shares dropped to 347p on the cash-call news but staged a swift
recovery as dealers absorbed the encouraging profits and dividend forecast.
Berkeley said it would use the funds to 'seize market opportunites', and
said the housing market had shown some signs of recovery. At the close the
shares were 10 up on balance at 370p.
Galliford dropped 8 to 39p after the steep fall in interim profits and the
almost halved dividend.
Blue Circle Industries eased 2 to 213p after a bearish note on the stock
from Yamaichi, whose building specialist Mr Scott Fulton said a combination
of the sharp rise in the shares and the timing of BCI 's results, after
those of Rugby, the cement group, and those of Hepworth, the heating
equipment group, suggests BCI are vulnerable to profit-taking.
A stock overhang in food retailer Tesco left the shares 2 lighter at 245p. A
block of around 3m shares was said to be looking for a home.
The poor trading at Ladbroke's DIY division weakened several stocks in the
stores sector with similar DIY subsidiaries. Boots gave up 6 to 505p, while
Kingfisher lost 13 to close at 529p. WH Smith 'A' eased 5 to 428p.
Public houses, hotels, drinks and nursing home company Boddington Group
cheered the market with a 29.6 per cent improvement in full-year figures to
Pounds 26.3m. The shares jumped 14 to 230p, with many brokers moving to
upgrade current-year profits forecasts.
The recent profits downgrading from Cazenove continued to hurt Allied-Lyons,
which ended 11 lower at 582p with volume reaching 4.3m shares. Guinness
bounced 4 to 444p on trade of 3.8m after Smith New Court reiterated its buy
recommendation.
Speculation that engineering group James Wilkes would soon be at the
receiving end of a bid drove the shares 5 forward to 64p.
A buy recommendation from Henderson Crosthwaite published earlier this week
continued to boost British Aerospace. At the day's best the stock was
trading at 290p, but came off the top with the market to close 11 1/2 ahead
at 273p after volume of 3.7m.
The positive sentiment in BAe helped Smiths Industries harden 3 to 358p.
US buyers continued to favour British Steel and the shares edged  3/4
forward to 85 1/4 p in trade of 9.2m.
Recovery prospects boosted both Glynwed International and William Cook. The
former appreciated 7 to 289p, while the latter moved forward 7 to 174p.
Among motors, Thomas Cowie lost 5 to 206p on profit-taking after Wednesday's
strong run which followed good figures.

FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Ladbroke active

<TEXT>
Turnover in hotels and leisure company Ladbroke Group rose sharply on strong
two-way business as the company reported full-year figures in line with
market expectations.
The stock advanced 7 to 207p initially on the release of the figures, with
dealers particularly pleased with the slight improvement in the dividend,
from 10.93p to 11.15p.
The analysts' meeting was said, however, to have been slightly 'down beat'
and the shares went into retreat as some brokers reduced current-year profit
expectations and others focused on how much the company will make from
future property disposals.
By the market close a hefty 14m shares had been traded, with the stock
surrendering the earlier gain to close a net penny easier at 199p.
Mr Bruce Jones at Smith New Court, one of the group's brokers, trimmed his
current-year forecast by Pounds 10m to 180m to take account of the slow
start to the year in the DIY and hotels division.
Mr Mark Finney at NatWest Markets lowered his forecast by Pounds 9m to
Pounds 172m but moved the stock from a hold to a buy recommendation.

FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays in record trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH widely rumoured in the stock market from as far back as early
October, the halved final dividend and appalling preliminary figures from
Barclays saw the bank's shares plummet in exceptionally heavy trading.
Turnover of 53m shares yesterday was by far the biggest single day's
business in the stock since activity levels were first recorded at the time
of Big Bang, in 1986.
Marketmakers chopped opening levels for Barclays from an overnight 433p to
405p as the dividend news was flashed up on the trading screens. The
mark-down, however, failed to stem a very heavy flow of selling orders,
mostly from the City's important and influential income funds. At worst the
shares dropped to 381p before settling 41, or almost 10 per cent, down at
392p.
Other bank shares failed to participate in Barclays' discomfort, with many
of the income funds moving quickly to shift their holdings out of Barclays
and into other bank stocks regarded as having secure dividends.
While many banking specialists continued to view Barclays as a strong
recovery play, others remain unconvinced. Mr Martin Hughes, banks analyst at
Credit Lyonnais Laing (CLL) and who first forecast the dividend cut in early
October, said: 'They are not out of the woods; the next area of bad news
will come from Europe, where big losses will offset any UK recovery.'
The CLL analyst reduced his current-year profits estimate to Pounds 367m and
expects the dividend payout to be held to the same level as for 1992. 'The
shares are high risk and should be sold,' he added, recommending a switch
into Lloyds, 7 higher at 547p, Royal Bank of Scotland, 6 up at 318p, TSB, 4
better at 175p, and Abbey National.

FT  05 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUTURES markets retained their confident tone yesterday in spite of the
general disappointment with the absence of any move to lower rates at the
meeting of the Bundesbank's policy council, writes Terry Byland.
Stock index futures held on to a premium against cash, compared with the
discount now computed on fair value.
Traders said the March future appeared to be consolidating its position. The
contract held comfortably above the testing 2,900 mark which was regained
this week, trading at 2,907 in very late deals, a premium of some 2 points
on the close of the underlying FT-SE 100 Index.
Trading volume eased, with the March contract recording 10,691 lots compared
with 15,631 on Wednesday. While there was no opportunity yesterday for
arbitraging against the cash market, traders noted active rolling over of
positions from the March and into the June contract - an indication of
underlying bullish views at this stage of the month, according to most
analysts.
Business in traded options was also reduced yesterday, the day's total of
28,838 contracts contrasting with the previous 35,468.
The FT-SE option, very active on Wednesday with 14,769 contracts dealt,
traded only 7,439. The Euro FT-SE turned over 4,730 lots, while among
individual stock options, British Steel stood out with 2,392 contracts.

FT  05 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Strong rally in bonds fails
to lift US stocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
ANOTHER strong rally in bond prices failed to lift stock market sentiment,
which was depressed by disappointing economic news, writes Patrick Harverson
in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 5.13 easier at 3,398.91 and the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.92 at 447.34, while the Nasdaq composite
slipped 3.19 to 680.73. NYSE volume was 232m shares.
Weak overseas markets set the tone for a downbeat opening to trading in the
US. The latest sharp advance in bond prices, which at one point sent the
yield on the benchmark 30-year bond issue down to another record low of
below 6.7 per cent, was ignored, primarily because the rise in bonds was
sparked by economic figures that disturbed stock market investors.
The day's data showed that state unemployment claims for the third week of
February rose by 26,000, far more than the 1,000 increase analysts had been
expecting, and that factory orders fell 1.3 per cent in January. The jobs
numbers were especially worrying - today the government releases the
February employment report. Investors are worried that the figures will show
that jobs growth continues to languish in an economic recovery that may even
be slowing.
Trading remained heavy in RJR Nabisco, which eased Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 8
1/2 in volume of 4m shares. RJR announced on Tuesday plans to sell a
separate group of shares that would give investors a stake in its worldwide
food operations; but after a gain that day RJR shares have since failed to
respond positively to news of the deal.
Wal-Mart was another of the day's most heavily traded stocks, dipping
Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 32 7/8 in turnover of 4.7m shares after the
retailing group announced flat sales for the month of February. Other
leading retailers were generally weaker on news of disappointing monthly
sales - although the weak sales were blamed on bad weather conditions during
February.
Some of the market's biggest drug stocks remained under pressure on
continued concern about possible price caps on pharmaceuticals prices.
Johnson &amp; Johnson fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 41 3/8 , Bristol-Myers
Squibb dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 56 and Merck slipped Dollars 1 to
Dollars 37 3/4 .
Salomon declined Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39 5/8 after stating that it had a
Dollars 250m pre-tax operating deficit in the first two months of this year
because of losses from proprietary securities trading.
Canada
TORONTO closed sharply higher, fuelled by a rally in banking shares, as
volume swelled to the best level since the stock market crash in October
1987 and was the third highest on record.
The TSE 300 index added 34.1 at 3,501.3, while advancing issues led declines
by 398 to 265 after volume of 68.6m shares.
Interest rate cuts and first-quarter earnings reports from the banks in line
or better than forecast boosted the banking sector, its index forging ahead
3.17 per cent.

FT  05 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: Volatile Mexico keeps a careful eye on
Clinton - Big reactions to small events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One week ago, Mexico's stock market was in trouble. Down 18 per cent from
the January 6 high of 1,836, the market had been rocked by President Bill
Clinton's equivocal commitment to the North American Free Trade Agreement,
and subsequent higher interest rates.
But just as despondency was about to set in, the market shot up 2.8 per cent
last Friday, and in one week has gained around 6.5 per cent. The market
seemingly decided, after last Friday's set-piece speech by Mr Clinton on
international relations, that stocks were cheap, and that the US president
was, after all, solidly behind Nafta.
Always one of the world's more volatile markets, Mexico has this year hit
new records for its sensitivity to small events. Whereas in the past,
volatility may have been affected by news in individual stocks, recently, as
Mr Roberto Barrera, of the brokerage Invermexico, points out, almost all
Mexican stocks have gone up or down together, mainly in reaction to news
about Nafta and movements on Wall Street.
The day Mr Clinton's administration slapped duties on imported steel, the
bolsa fell 2.2 per cent, fearing protectionism from the White House. When Mr
Richard Gephardt, the leader of Democrats in the US House of
Representatives, complained about a Dollars 3.75m Mexican government
investment in a fund that bought US companies and moved them to Mexico,
another 2.1 per cent was lost. When Mr Brian Mulroney announced his
intention to resign, the Canadian problem suddenly became current and the
Mexican market shed a further 1.75 per cent.
While such falls partly reflect Wall Street's negative reaction to Mr
Clinton's economic plan, fears over Nafta were crucial. The treaty's prompt
approval matters so much, analysts argue, because it will encourage more
direct investment into Mexico, and improve expectations of such investment.
This should allow interest rates to fall since pressure to attract
short-term money market investment to finance the fast growing trade deficit
will have subsided. Lower interest rates will increase growth and corporate
earnings, and on top, make the equity market more attractive relative to the
money market.
Further still, says Mr Jorge Mariscal of Goldman Sachs, the safe passage of
Nafta should allow a significant increase in government spending to coincide
with next year's presidential elections.
The perceived dependence on a single event outside the Mexican government's
control explains the full extent of the bolsa's reaction to nuances of US
economic and trade policy. And since foreign, mainly US, investors dominate
trading in Mexico's liquid stocks such as Telmex, there is nothing the
Mexican authorities or institutions can do to reduce their exposure.
But unlike last June, when the market tumbled for similar reasons, there has
yet to be any pressure on the peso, which has devalued by far less than the
40 centavos a day permitted by the Bank of Mexico. Mr Jacques Levy, head of
the international side at Banamex-Accival, Mexico's largest financial
institution, says: 'While people talk about the current account deficit
problem, Nafta and so on, I have to sell dollars to the central bank every
day.'
Foreigners have simply switched their investment from the equity market to
money markets and CDs. The 28-day interest on Cetes, Mexican government
paper, is now at 18 per cent, about 15 percentage points above the
equivalent paper in the US. The higher yield for most investors more than
offsets the risk of a devaluation against the dollar.
For the rest of the year, analysts are expecting still more volatility while
news about Nafta remains unclear. Nevertheless, 'this could change very
quickly if the US sends a strong positive signal about Nafta', says Mr
Mickey Schlein of Morgan Stanley. All eyes are thus focused on March 17,
when US, Canadian and Mexican negotiators meet in Washington to discuss the
proposed parallel agreements on labour, the environment and import surges.

FT  05 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Political hopes take
Hong Kong to record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LINGERING concern over the yen's strength continued to weigh on the market,
and share prices closed lower on small-lot selling by investment trusts and
dealers, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 94.31 at 16,759.61 after a day's high of 16,840.67
and low of 16,721.48. Small-lot sales of export-oriented stocks depressed
prices as the yen hit a new Tokyo high of Y116.15 against the dollar. The
yen later fell below Y117 in the afternoon, but investors failed to respond.
Volume came to 230m shares, compared with 251m on Wednesday, and declines
outpaced gains by 656 to 311, with 168 issues unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks slipped 6.47 to 1,266.11, but in London the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.40 to 1,013.14.
Volatility on the currency markets hurt leading exporters, while importers
of raw materials and fuels, seen as beneficiaries of a higher yen, were
firm. Electric power companies were the top gaining sector, rising 1.4 per
cent.
Railway-related shares were picked up by dealers who hope that the autumn
listing of JR East, created by a break-up of the former state-owned Japan
Railways, could ignite interest in companies with close links to railway
companies.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, which has gained some 10 per cent in the
past four trading sessions, relinquished Y4,000 to Y666,000 on light
profit-taking. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel attributed the recent rise of
the semi-state-owned company to buying by Japanese securities houses,
wanting to gain the lead underwriting role for JR East.
Nippon Comsys, an electrical engineering group with close links to NTT,
declined Y12 to Y719, while Fujikura, the cable company, receded Y9 to Y570.
Tokyo Electric Power, which relies on fuel imports, advanced Y60 to Y2,740,
while electrical engineering concerns affiliated to the power suppliers
gained ground. Kyudenko appreciated Y50 to Y1,640 and Kandenko moved forward
Y40 to Y2,170.
Brokerage issues fell on earnings worries. Daiwa Securities dipped Y30 to
Y820 and Nomura Securities Y20 to Y1,440. Nomura announced plans to cut
executive salaries by 10 to 20 per cent from March due to worse than
expected earnings prospects.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 71.27 to 17,855.38 in turnover of 118.6m
shares. Volume surged on cross trading by investors wanting to realise
profits on stock holdings.
Roundup
INVESTORS IN Hong Kong pronounced themselves satisfied with Wednesday's
budget, but more importantly they took heart at political developments, and
shares finished at an all-time high. The latest rally brings stock prices to
some 30 per cent above their lows of early December.
US institutions who had been buying back into the Hong Kong market for
several days were joined yesterday by local investors and some mainland
Chinese buyers.
Mr Michael Franklin of Kim Eng Securities in London said the colony's budget
proposals had been well received but that the strong market performance
indicated that investors were now looking for a break-through in the
political situation when Governor Chris Patten addresses the Legislative
Council today.
HONG KONG saw the Hang Seng index gain 31.16, or 0.48 per cent, at 6,467.80,
having touched a peak of 6,538.32 shortly after the opening, in heavy
turnover exceeding HKDollars 5bn. The previous intraday and closing records
were 6,470 and 6,447 respectively, reached on November 12.
Shares opened at a record high, driven by good annual results for HSBC's
Midland Bank, and expectations of a 25 per cent rise in profits for HSBC
being revealed later this month. HSBC, the biggest component of the Hang
Seng index, ended HKDollars 1 higher at HKDollars 67, after reaching
HKDollars 68.
TAIWAN continued its upward drive and the weighted index added 154.71, or
3.4 per cent, to set an 11-month peak of 4,737.32. The index has risen 40
per cent since the start of February in a rally sparked by easing political
tensions, a better economic outlook and the formation of a new, pro-business
cabinet.
SINGAPORE drew encouragement from Keppel's 14.3 per cent increase in 1992
earnings and the Straits Times Industrial index rose 6.57 to 1,658 in volume
of 157.26m shares, against 77.21m on Wednesday. Keppel put on 10 cents at
SDollars 7.05 but its Singmarine subsidiary shed 12 cents to SDollars 3.56
on reporting a 42 per cent drop in 1992 net profits.
AUSTRALIA eased afresh amid continuing uncertainty over the March 13 federal
election. The All Ordinaries index dipped 3.2 to 1,622.9.

FT  05 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continent easier after Buba
statement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the Bundesbank's constancy did not surprise, some bourses reflected a
disappointment, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT fell back in expectation of the Bundesbank's announcement after
the close with some analysts commenting that the market now felt a lack of
direction. The DAX index finished 6.33 lower at 1,687.40 as turnover fell to
DM6.3bn from DM8.1bn.
Schering was one of the day's strong performers, rising DM9.50 to DM745.50
on hopes that a drug for multiple sclerosis, which will be the first of its
kind, will gain approval from the US Federal Drugs Administration later this
month.
In contrast Siemens weakened DM2.20 to DM662.80. Mr Glen Liddy, a German
analyst at Kleinwort Benson in London, said that the stocks current discount
to the market was unjustified given forecasts of a modest earnings recovery
in 1993. He added that the stock had been oversold on the basis of a poor
order book at the end of last year: this had changed substantially in recent
weeks with big orders coming from India and Hong Kong.
PARIS had a volatile day with the CAC-40 index moving between a day's high
of 2,007 and a low of 1,978 before closing down 8.49 at 1,986.75 in turnover
of some FFr3.5bn.
Peugeot lost FFr31 to FFr590 as the view gathered momentum that this year
will be extremely tough for the sector and further negative reports were
published. Michelin slipped FFr3.80 to FFr179.70.
In spite of reporting its first ever loss due to taking provisions on
property holdings Suez closed up FFr8.60 at FFr305.00. Some analysts
commented that while the results had been dreadful there was speculation
that the chairman might leave allowing a change in the shareholding
structure, with UAP being mentioned.
Lafarge lost FFr16.50 to FFr340.00 on disappointing results from its
bioactivities division. Axa gained FFr28 to FFr1,272, supported by recent
results from Equitable Life.
AMSTERDAM reflected a slight sense of relief that Philips' results were more
or less in line with expectations. The CBS Tendency index advanced 1.1 to
101.0 as Philips added Fl 1.10 to Fl 22.50. Analysts pointed to the weakness
of the consumer electronics division and the group's need to take a further
Fl 1.2bn of restructuring provisions. Polygram put on Fl 1.70 to Fl 48.90.
DSM's results did not surprise as the group halved the dividend and the
shares put on Fl 1.60 to Fl 73.20, still down 4.5 per cent since the start
of the week. Akzo gained 70 cents to Fl 73.20. Heineken, which released
solid figures just after the close, was Fl 1.20 firmer at Fl 187.50.
MILAN resumed its upward trend after Wednesday's pause with much of the
interest again centring on blue chips that have lagged this year's rally.
The Comit index rose 3.58 to 536.72.
Olivetti found support, fixing L108 higher at L2,448 before easing to L2,440
after hours.
Analysts suggested variously that the group will benefit from more stable
prices in the PC market; that the share was the subject of general rotation
among stocks; and that the buying could be linked to Olivetti's accord with
Digital Equipment of the US last year which provided for the US company to
buy 9.5m Olivetti shares by this June.
Retailer Rinascente rose L310 to L8,710 as old rumours resurfaced of its
imminent sale by Fiat. The car maker fixed L99 ahead to L6,000 before

FT  05 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Futures slip sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN futures contracts fell back sharply yesterday after the Bundesbank
kept its officially posted rates unchanged at its council meeting, writes
James Blitz.
Dealers in interest rate markets had assumed that the German central bank
would yesterday cut 25 basis points off the discount rate, which is at 8.00
per cent. However, it made no alteration to monetary policy, nor did it
announce a new fixed rate repo for next week's money market intervention.
The March Euromark contract retreated 11 basis points to finish at 91.93.
There are no more council meetings between now and the contract's expiry in
less than two weeks' time, and the contract is close to converging with the
level of three-month D-Mark interest rates, which yesterday were at 8.15 per
cent.
French franc futures retraced sharply in the wake of the Bundesbank meeting,
although they are still trading in the middle of their recent range.
The March contract dropped 40 basis points from its opening level to close
at 88.31, and the June contract also lost 40 basis points to end at 90.90.
French three-month cash rose  5/16 percentage point to 11 7/8 per cent, and
the one-month rate was  1/8 firmer at 11 3/4 per cent by the close.
Sterling futures also weakened, in spite of recent assurances from UK
officials that a reduction in german rates would not have meant an easing of
British policy anyway.
The March contract dropped 11 basis points from the opening level, finishing
at 93.97. Three-month cash was more or less unchanged at 6 1/16 per cent, in
spite of difficulties removing a large Pounds 1.55bn shortage.
Despite the clear disappointment about yesterday's decision by the
Bundesbank, dealers clearly believe that the European exchange rate
mechanism will remain intact, tying French rates to Germany's.
The futures market is predicting that three-month D-Marks will be at 6.98
per cent in June and that three-month French francs will sell at 9.1 per
cent, providing a premium of more than 200 basis points against France.
One dealer said that the futures prices would have converged yesterday if
the market thought that the ERM would break up because the French wanted to
bring short-term rates down.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Slight pressure on franc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH THE French franc and Danish krone weakened mildly against the D-Mark
yesterday after the Bundesbank surprised some dealers by deciding not to
change its officially posted interest rates at its fortnightly council
meeting, writes James Blitz.
The decision not to reduce either the discount rate or the rate for
securities repurchase tenders caused some disappointment. Earlier in the
week, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, had suggested that
short-term money market interest rates could fall in the wake of changes in
German minimum reserve requirements, and the D-Mark softened on Monday and
Tuesday.
Yesterday, positions were retraced. The franc closed at FFr3.398 to the
D-Mark,  1/3 centime down on the day. At lunchtime in the US, the franc
crossed the FFr3.40 level against the D-Mark for the first time in more than
a month.
The Danish krone also wobbled yesterday, dipping sharply to DKr3.8550 to the
D-Mark from DKr3.835 as the news from Frankfurt emerged. By last night it
was comfortably trading at DKr3.8369.
The dollar fell back nearly a pfennig to close at DM1.6355 in London. In New
York it recovered a little to finish at DM1.6398.
If the market's reaction was muted yesterday, it was because there was a
strong expectation of an easing in Bundesbank policy at the next council
meeting on March 18.
Negotiations on the Solidarity Pact to reduce Germany's budget deficit and
help the reconstruction of eastern Germany will resume on March 11-12, and
the successful conclusion of these talks may be an important precursor to
any further easing in Bundesbank policy.
Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets said the talks are unlikely
to be fully completed before the summer. But she believes there may soon be
a resolution of the critical issue of how the central and regional
governments share the development costs of east Germany in the 1990s, and
this may help to bring a cut in the discount rate in two weeks' time.
Some market participants said there could still be a resurgence of ERM
strains in the interim. Mr Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at Bank
of America in London, believed that pressure on the French franc could
intensify if the Bundesbank does not lower its repo rate next Tuesday. A
leading London-based fund manager said ERM pressure was unlikely to emerge,
however, because of a feeling that the Bundesbank would ease policy in the
event of any pressure on the French currency.
One factor testing the D-Mark's strength will be today's non-farm payroll
figure in the US. The market is expecting the February number to come
between 80,000 and 150,000. According to Mr Hawkins, the D-Mark will only
make gains if the figure comes in at a very low level.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bombay gem trade picks up the
pieces - Life is getting back to normal after the riots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ST VALENTINE'S Day sales are usually a highlight of the year for the Mr
Shrenik Zaveri, an Indian diamonds and jewellery merchant, whose gems are
sold all over the world.
But not this year. The inter-religious riots which brought death and
destruction to Bombay in December and January also disrupted one of the
world's largest production centres for diamonds and jewellery. Thousands of
workers, mainly from the minority Muslim community, fled for their lives and
did not return for a month or more. Merchants closed their offices for fear
of being looted. The industry postponed its show-piece annual international
exhibition. 'We lost time, we lost business and we lost money,' says Mr
Zaveri, an executive working for Rosy Blue, a Bombay-based group owned by Mr
B. Arunkumar, which is one of the world's biggest diamond cutting
enterprises.
The industry is now slowly getting back to normal, with workshops in Bombay
and in the nearby city of Surat resuming production, merchants moving around
the country in safety again and the exhibition rescheduled for this month,
albeit in truncated form.
Mr Zaveri is certain that the unrest will prove only a temporary break for
the Indian gems and jewellery industry, which is set to benefit greatly from
the country's effort to modernise and integrate its economy with the rest of
the world.
It will not come too soon for India, which has failed to fully capitalise in
modern times on its long tradition in gems and jewellery. Diamonds were
mined in India for hundreds of years before they were discovered in South
Africa. The Koh-i-noor diamond in the British crown jewels is only the most
famous of the millions of stones unearthed in India before the mines were
exhausted.
But it is only since the Second World War that India has emerged as an
important international centre for cutting gemstones, largely thanks to the
efforts of long-established diamond trading families, mostly bearing the
surname Zaveri. Low-cost, high-skill labour gave India an advantage over the
traditional cutting centres of Antwerp and Israel. Nearly two-thirds of the
world's diamonds are now cut in India, plus a substantial share of the
rubies, sapphires and other coloured stones. Gems and jewellery exports
earned India USDollars 2.5bn in exports in the year to March 1992. In
1992-93 it should exceed Dollars 2.6bn, in spite of the unrest. The global
economic slow-down has hit sales, but, as a low-cost producer, India is
surviving the downturn better than other centres.
However, with improved manufacturing techniques and better marketing India
could greatly increase its revenues by increasing the added value in its
exports. In particular, it could diversify from cutting stones into making
and exporting more of its own jewellery. While India has about 40 per cent
of the market in cutting (by value) it has less than 1 per cent of
international trade in jewellery.
Rosy Blue and other companies are beginning to exploit this opportunity.
'Large-scale jewellery exports only started in the late 1980s. We are
diversifying into jewellery. That's where we see the future,' says Mr
Zaveri. Last year exports sales jumped 50 per cent to Dollars 299m and are
expected to exceed Dollars 350m in 1992-93.
Rosy Blue has built a factory dedicated to jewellery exports on the edge of
Bombay airport, in an export-processing zone where customs formalities are
kept to a minimum. Mr VSA Sury, secretary of the Gem and Jewellery Export
Promotion Council, says it is vital for India to expand jewellery-making
because other countries - including Thailand, China, Sri Lanka and Malaysia
 -also have reservoirs of low-cost, high-skill labour capable of cutting
stones.
However, Indian jewellery makers face some severe difficulties. They are
hampered by the red-tape that still binds much of the Indian economy,
despite recent deregulation. For example, special licences are needed to
secure foreign exchange to fund imports of stones and precious metals.
Furthermore, the high-cost of bank credit in India - the minimum lending
rate is 17 per cent - hinders stock-building.
There are as yet no internationally-known Indian brand names in jewellery.
Indian designs too are often too ornate for western and Japanese tastes.
Quality control is frequently not as well controlled as in developed
countries. 'We must improve our manufacturing techniques and our marketing,'
says Mr Sury.
Yet Bombay's diamond merchants are confident enough of the future to plan
building a new headquarters - a Rs6bn (Pounds 130m) tower to be called the
Bharat Diamond Bourse.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Platinum producers complain of
market distortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SA MR MICHAEL McMahon, chairman of Impala Platinum, the world's second
largest producer, yesterday launched a strong attack on 'industrial
concerns' which he accused of manipulating the platinum market.
His comments follow a week in which two announcements, both later shown to
be at least partly inaccurate, caused the platinum price to plummet from
nearly Dollars 370 to about Dollars 340 a troy ounce. The rhodium price fell
in sympathy, reaching Dollars 1,450 an ounce, the lowest for nearly five
years.
The first false alarm, which caused the initial price crack, was a story
last week suggesting that Japanese car makers were selling off their stocks
of platinum group metals (PGM), which include palladium as well as platinum
and rhodium. The price fall was then exacerbated by the release of a report
by Allied-Signal suggesting that it had developed a new catalytic converter
using only palladium.
In a statement entitled 'Is this fair play?' Mr McMahon said the latest
announcements were further examples of incidents during the past few years
that had adversely affected platinum producers' revenues, profits and
working capital. 'I am deeply concerned at the common thread which runs
through most of these announcements, which initially overstate a position,
causing severe downward pressure on the PGM markets and are followed a day
or so later by a retraction, withdrawal, or considerable watering down of
the original message.'
This view has been endorsed by Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest
producer, which said yesterday that some of its shafts were losing money and
if current price levels continued, Rusplats would have to consider closing
shafts.
Mr Todd Bruce, marketing director of Rusplats, the world's largest producer,
said there was no factual support for the claim that car companies were
selling stocks.
Allied-Signal followed their initial announcement with a statement saying
that although its new catalyst system would become an important part of its
new business, it would not replace traditional platinum or rhodium based
systems.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: UK threatens France over fish
deliveries disruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK threatened last night to take France to the European Court in protest
over violent disruption of deliveries of British fish mounted by French
fishermen.
Mr Allan Stewart, a junior Scottish Office minister, said Britain might
'need to have recourse to the European institutions' if 'quick redress' for
the incidents was not forthcoming.
He said he was encouraged by France's response to requests to provide
protection for British cargoes when notice was given.
British officials had made it clear to their French counterparts that they
were monitoring fresh incidents perpetrated by French fishermen some of whom
were 'totally out of control,' he said.
He urged the French authorities to 'act to restore order.'
Clashes between police and fishermen protesting against the increase in
imports of cheap fish into France reached a climax some ten days ago when
800 fishermen stormed the vast wholesale fish market at Rungis on the
outskirts of Paris, leaving hundreds of tonnes of damaged fish strewn over
the floor.
Only a few hours later Mr John Major, the prime minister, promised at
Westminster that he would leave France 'in no doubt' that those who had
earlier attacked a British consignment of fish in Brittany should be brought
to book.
France would be told it was expected to act where necessary to 'safeguard
free trade, to pay compensation when losses have occurred and to bring the
perpetrators to book.'
Mr Major's response followed demands by Tory MPs yesterday that the prime
minister raise the issue with the French government and ensure compensation
was paid to 'all in Britain who have lost cash.'
That spate of violence was calmed by French government assurances that the
EC would agree to impose minimum prices on imported fish.
Yesterday's threat came in a Commons debate called by Mr Phil Gallie, the
Tory MP for Ayr, to discuss fish exports through France, and particularly
the question of damage and compensation to a local Scottish company.
Claiming that Pounds 10,000 worth of 'Clyde-caught fish' was destroyed in a
French market by having diesel poured over it, Mr Gallie said that the
recent violence had caused 'a serious disruption totrade.'
A total of Pounds 2.5m worth of damage had been done and five French
fishermen had been arrested, he added.
Mr David Harris, Conservative MP for St Ives, said British exporters were
now afraid to use British transport for fear their produce would be
immediately set on by 'thugs.'

PLATINUM was fixed at Dollars 340.75 a troy ounce in the afternoon on the
London bullion market - still Dollars 2 down from the Wednesday's close but
Dollars 1 above the morning, its lowest fix since January 22, 1992.
'Platinum is falling although I'm not sure that it wants to. If there is
going to be a big move, I think it will be down rather than up,' said one
analyst. GOLD traded in a tight range, limited on the downside by good
physical demand at Dollars 327 to Dollars 328 a troy ounce. Sentiment
remains bearish on the LME following the losses of the last week, and
although most markets consolidated in narrow ranges yesterday, rallies were
seen as fresh selling opportunities. Three-month COPPER spent most of the
day above Dollars 2,150 a tonne, but was unable to push significantly
higher, and prices eased back under late liquidation. Final business was at
Dollars 2,145. Three-month ALUMINIUM continued to encounter resistance on
moves towards Dollars 1,190, and gradually lost heart, settling back to end
at Dollars 1,182.25.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians rescue Greek oranges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE

<DATELINE>
   ATHENS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG DEMAND from Russia this winter has helped to compensate Greek orange
growers for lost market share in the European Community.
Exports of oranges reached 262,700 tonnes, a 13.6 per cent rise from last
year, according to the Greek Fruit Exporters' Association.
The Soviet Union had been Greece's biggest customer for citrus fruit, taking
about 250,000 tonnes every winter. But demand collapsed with its break-up
and the demise of the state purchasing system and Russian importers bought a
paltry 3,500 tonnes in the winter of 1991-92.
This winter, however, they were back with a vengeance, buying more than
150,000 tonnes.
'Citrus fever overtook the Russians this winter. We could have sold them
practically the whole Greek crop, if it were possible to ship it all,' said
Mr George Frangistas of Gefra, one of Greece's largest fruit exporters.
Gefra exported about 48,000 tonnes of oranges to Russia, selling mainly to
small private import companies, he said.
However, Greek orange exports to other EC countries fell by 61 per cent over
the same period to 15,100 tonnes, most of which went to Germany.
Following a much-improved harvest, exports of lemons reached 35,900 tonnes,
compared with only 8,800 tonnes last winter. But Russian importers showed no
interest in Greek lemons but demand was lively in other eastern European
countries.
Increasing competition from Spanish and Italian producers has steadily
eroded Greece's share of the EC market and Greek orange producers can no
longer claim subsidies for exporting elsewhere in the EC.

His comments follow a week in which two announcements, both later shown to
be at least partly inaccurate, caused the platinum price to plummet from
nearly Dollars 370 to about Dollars 340 a troy ounce. The rhodium price fell
in sympathy, reaching Dollars 1,450 an ounce, the lowest for nearly five
years.
The first false alarm, which caused the initial price crack, was a story
last week suggesting that Japanese car makers were selling off their stocks
of platinum group metals, which include palladium as well as platinum and
rhodium. The price fall was then exacerbated by the release of a report by
Allied-Signal suggesting that it had developed a new catalytic converter
using only palladium.
In a statement entitled 'Is this fair play?' Mr McMahon said the latest
announcements were further examples of incidents during the past few years
that had adversely affected platinum producers' revenues, profits and
working capital. 'I am deeply concerned at the common thread which runs
through most of these announcements, which initially overstate a position,
causing severe downward pressure on the PGM markets and are followed a day
or so later by a retraction, withdrawal, or considerable watering down of
the original message.
This view has been endorsed by Rustenburg Platinum, the world's largest
producer, which said yesterday that some of its shafts were losing money and
if current price levels continued, Rusplats would have to consider closing
shafts.
Mr Todd Bruce, marketing director of Rusplats, the world's largest producer,
said there was no factual support for the claim that car companies were
selling stocks.
As to palladium catalysts, Allied-Signal followed their initial announcement
in a matter of hours with a follow-up statement saying that although its new
catalyst system would become an important part of its new business, it would
not replace traditional platinum or rhodium based systems.
Impala and Rustenburg's views do not, however, enjoy complete support from
the broking community. One local analyst said that while he would not
discount a certain amount of mischief on the part of customers, he had
limited sympathy for producers complaining that their market was being
disrupted. Arguing that concern about the Japanese economy was the main
reason why PGM prices had cracked, he said local producers would have to
send a signal by closing shafts for the price to recover.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Cocoa prices fall again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL

<TEXT>
London cocoa prices again fell sharply yesterday on market pessimism over
the Geneva talks, writes David Blackwell. The London May contract, which
shed Pounds 21 on Wednesday, fell a further Pounds 22 to close at the day's
low of Pounds 705 a tonne.
'It was mainly disillusion with the ICCO talks,' said Mr Tony Chadwick of
Prudential Bache. 'You would have thought a Pounds 40 drop in the market
might have encouraged producers to be more realistic and set their sights a
little bit lower.'

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Forestry Commission waste
criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK Forestry Commission could earn 15 per cent more revenue from timber
sales if it improved its harvesting plans and stuck to them when carrying
out tree felling, according to a critical report by the National Audit
Office.
The report, published yesterday, says the commission is foregoing Pounds
10.8m of income from timber sales, which in 1991-92 was Pounds 73m. But it
acknowledges that a cause of the problem is that the commission has to meet
diverse non-financial objectives set by the government.
The NAO report to the House of Commons public accounts committee says its
analysis showed that 49 per cent of trees were being felled on average more
than five years before or after their age of maximum return, meaning that
Pounds 5.6m of income was being foregone.
This was because harvesting plans drawn up by the Edinburgh-based commission
on the basis of its inventory are refined by local managers to take account
of wind damage, environmental considerations and differences between actual
and recorded stock levels.
Even then, the NAO found, some 50 per cent of timber intended for harvesting
in local plans was actually obtained from forest areas that were not in the
plans. On average trees felled were three to five years younger than those
planned to be harvested, meaning that an estimated further Pounds 5.2m of
income was being foregone.
The NAO said the commission needed a formal system to monitor variations
between planned and actual harvesting. But it noted that that it had cut the
cost of tree felling by 42 per cent in real terms since 1980.
The commission manages 900,000 hectares of forest with an expected value of
Pounds 2.8bn. It is expected by the Treasury to make a real rate of return
of 3 per cent on its plantations, but also to meet the government's
objectives of enhancing nature conservation, breaking up the uniform forests
and providing recreational facilities.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: 'Last chance' cocoa talks to
adjourn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCOA CONSUMING and producing countries will today formally adjourn
unsuccessful talks on a new international cocoa pact with price
stabilisation provisions and agree to return for a fifth round of
negotiations later this year. The 1986 pact expires at the end of September
and cannot be extended.
The current session of United Nations-sponsored talks, billed as the final
round, has made little progress over the past two weeks. The decision to
adjourn rather than abandon the negotiations followed signs yesterday that
some producers were willing to make big concessions on both prices and
financing to secure an agreement with economic provisions.
The two sides will have further consultations under the auspices of the
International Cocoa Council in London before setting a date for the next
two-week negotiating session. The council is to hold its next meeting later
this month.
Mr Alain Gauze, commodities minister of the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest
cocoa producer, yesterday floated new ideas on financing the proposed stocks
withholding scheme for market support, and said the price range to be
defended was 'negotiable'. However, delegates said other producer
representatives were divided on how far to concede consumer demands and
there was insufficient time to reach an agreed producer position before the
talks ended today.
Mr Gauze's proposals, made orally at a meeting of producer countries, go
some way towards bridging the gap between the two sides over the vexed
financing issue. Producers want consumers to share the costs of the new
scheme, while consumers say it should be financed, initially at least, from
the existing assets of the International Cocoa Organisation. These consist
mainly of arrears owed by producers, notably the Ivory Coast and Brazil, and
the 233,000 tonne buffer stock which ceased operations in 1988.
Talking to reporters after the meeting, Mr Gauze said he had suggested a
three-pronged financing scheme. The first prong would be for countries in
arrears to pay for the cost of their own withholding, which would then be
offset against their ICCO debts. This proposal, put forward last week by the
talks' chairman, Mr Peter Lai of Malaysia, has already been accepted by
consumers in principle.
The second would be limited sales from the buffer stock, of both defective
and sound beans, to fund withholdings by new producing members. Consumers
have proposed sales of up to 20,000 tonnes a year to help finance the
overall scheme, Mr Jan van Sluisveld, their spokesman, said.
The third and controversial element would be a levy on cocoa exported to or
imported from non-members. Producer calls for equal burden-sharing with an
across-the-board trade levy have been firmly rejected by consumer countries
while existing resources suffice to finance the new accord. But one consumer
delegate said yesterday that Mr Gauze's proposals were worth considering.
On prices, there has been no movement since Wednesday when consumers
increased their floor price offer from SDR840 to SDR900, while producers
reduced their demand from SDR1,180 to SDR1,040 as proposed by Mr Lai last
week.
The only tangible progress made at the meeting was an agreement by the two
sides last week on a maximum limit of 350,000 tonnes of cocoa to be withheld
from the market.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Thai output cut spurs sugar
rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID decline in estimates of sugar production in Thailand has been the
major spur behind the rally which has taken prices on the New York futures
market above 10 cents a lb, according to the latest report from ED &amp; F. Man,
the London trade house.
The fall follows dry weather earlier in the season and hints of disease. But
the report warns that some of the lower estimates - some market rumours have
suggested a fall of 1.7m tonnes to 3.5m tonnes - may be exaggerated.
According to Man's latest information, Thai sugar production up to February
28 was 4.23 per cent behind the corresponding period last year at 3.09m
tonnes. The quantity of cane crushed has fallen by 7.5 per cent to 30.13m
tonnes.
Higher yields of 102.53 kg a tonne compared with 99.03 kg last year account
for the different percentage falls. This is partly because of the
introduction of a payment system based on sugar content, which may have
encouraged farmers to delay sending cane to the mills, Man suggests.
Based on progress in previous years, the total cane crush by the middle of
this month would be only 37m tonnes, but such an early finish to the crop
seems unlikely. Man's lowest estimate for the total cane crop is now 43m
tonnes, giving 4.3m tonnes of sugar. It puts maximum possible sugar
production at 4.7m tonnes.
If Thai production were to fall below 4.3m tonnes, the world sugar market
would be pushed into a trade deficit that could support further price rises,
Man suggests. But by and large physical buyers are well covered, which
should limit the upside potential.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russian buyers rescue Greek
citrus sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG DEMAND from Russia this winter has helped to compensate Greek orange
growers for lost market share in the European Community.
Exports of oranges reached 262,700 tonnes, a 13.6 per cent rise from last
year, according to the Greek Fruit Exporters' Association.
The Soviet Union had been Greece's biggest customer for citrus fruit, taking
about 250,000 tonnes every winter. But demand collapsed with its break-up
and the demise of the state purchasing system and Russian importers bought a
paltry 3,500 tonnes in the winter of 1991-92. This winter, however, they
were back with a vengeance, buying more than 150,000 tonnes.
'Citrus fever overtook the Russians this winter. We could have sold them
practically the whole Greek crop, if it were possible to ship it all,' said
Mr George Frangistas of Gefra, one of Greece's largest fruit exporters.
Gefra exported about 48,000 tonnes of oranges to Russia, selling mainly to
small private import companies, he said.
However, Greek orange exports to other EC countries fell by 61 per cent over
the same period to 15,100 tonnes, most of which went to Germany.
Following a much-improved harvest, exports of lemons reached 35,900 tonnes,
compared with only 8,800 tonnes last winter. Russian importers showed no
interest in Greek lemons but demand was lively in other eastern European
countries.
Increasing competition from Spanish and Italian producers, who have lower
transport costs and grow the thin-skinned orange varieties that are more
attractive to supermarket buyers, has steadily eroded Greece's share of the
EC market.
Now that the single market is in force, Greek orange producers can no longer
claim subsidies for exporting elsewhere in the community. A bumper crop of
about 1m tonnes has kept producer prices below Dr40 (20 US cents) a kilogram
for all but the best fruit.
While domestic demand for table oranges remains steady at about 300,000
tonnes, processing of orange concentrate for juice, which usually accounts
for another 200,000 tonnes, will decline this year. Processors were hit
badly by an 80 per cent drop in prices for imported Brazilian concentrate.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Weak economic data fuel strong Treasuries
rally

NEWS of a big rise in weekly jobless claims and a fall in monthly factory
orders fuelled another big rally in US bond markets yesterday, although
prices came off their highs late in the day on nervousness ahead of today's
key employment report.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  25/32 at 105
5/32 , yielding 6.722 per cent. Earlier in the day the issue had been more
than a full point higher, and the yield had dropped down below 6.7 per cent
for the first time ever.
At the short end of the market the gains were considerably less pronounced.
The two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 1/4 , to yield 3.721 per cent.
Buyers of government securities were evident overnight on foreign markets,
but prices did not really take off until New York trading opened.
The market was energised by two sets of economic data - the 26,000 increase
in unemployment claims during the third week of January (analysts had
expected claims to rise by not much more than 5,000) and the 1.3 per cent
decline in January factory orders (analysts had expected a decline of about
only half that figure).
The figures, while bullish for bonds because they suggest the economic
recovery may be slowing, were not enough on their own to justify yesterday's
big gains.
Traders said that the market recently has been 'feeding on itself', and that
there has been a big move into bonds by investors in mortgage-backed
securities, where falling interest rates have raised fears of heavy
pre-payment by mortgage-holders. Some dealers categorised some of
yesterday's early buying as 'panicky'.
The market retreated later in the day, however, as investors took to the
sidelines before today's important jobs report for February. The monthly
employment numbers are traditionally the most closely watched indicators of
economic activity, and investors will be looking to today's statistics for
the latest indication on how the labour market is responding to recent
improvements in economic growth.
Analysts are forecasting that non-farm payrolls will show a moderate
increase of about 125,000 for February, which would follow January's 106,000
gain.
MOST European bond markets continued to rally yesterday despite
disappointment when the Bundesbank decided to leave German official interest
rates unchanged.
An initial setback on the news was reversed as bond markets turned their
sights instead to the next planned meeting of the Bundesbank council, on
March 18.
The German market jumped to new highs once the news had been digested,
before falling back to end with 10-year bund yields just one basis point
down on the day.
The gains were stronger in other continental markets, however, with the
yield on Danish government bonds falling by 12 basis points, on Swedish
bonds by nine basis points and on Spanish bonds by three basis points.
'Europe is relaxed about today's news,' said Mr Richard Gray, an analyst
with UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London.
Longer-dated bond prices across Europe could continue to strengthen in
anticipation of the forthcoming German cuts, though short-term interest
rates would remain volatile as pressures ebbed and flowed in the European
exchange rate mechanism, he said.
The March bund future on Liffe, which opened the day at 95.90, fell to below
95.60 and then jumped as high as 96.16 before settling back at 95.95.
French bond futures followed a similar pattern, the March Notionell contract
on the Matif in Paris hitting a high of 114.80 before settling back at
114.46.
After a strong performance this week which has seen the yield spread between
the French and German markets tighten notably, French cash bonds eased back
a little yesterday.
UK government bonds eased on the day, though continuing demand for sterling
paper - which also prompted Pounds 350m of Eurosterling bonds to be issued -
acted as a support to the market.
The June long gilt future, which started the day at 106 1/2 , slid to 106
1/4 by the close, while cash gilts lost less than a quarter of a point.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Question mark over CSFB as an
era ends - The elevation of the London chairman to the holding company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT SUISSE First Boston and its London chairman, Mr Hans-Jorg Rudloff,
have raised strong passions in the Euromarkets since the beginning of the
1980s. Arrogant, aggressive, ambitious - the bank has aroused a pungent
mixture of distaste and respect in its rise to become one of the top
London-based investment banks.
Yesterday's announcement that Mr Rudloff was being elevated to the board of
the bank's Swiss holding company, CS Holding, signalled the end of an era.
It also raised a question about what changes lie in store for one of the
most successful institutions operating in London's international financial
markets.
The answer yesterday from Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS Holding: 'None.' He
shrugged off suggestions that the management moves had been prompted by
CSFB's disappointing performance in 1992. The bulk of the group's profits
last year were provided by First Boston, which had been outshone by CSFB in
previous years. In addition, CSFB's standing in the Eurobond league table
slipped to third, with a market share down to under 6 per cent.
'There has been no dissatisfaction with last year's performance, even if it
wasn't as shining as in the past,' said Mr Gut. Profits were held back by
CSFB's expansion in eastern Europe and the move of its London operations to
Canary Wharf, which takes effect on Monday. Both of these were investments
for the future, he said. There were no plans to change course.
Despite this, the close identification of Mr Rudloff with CSFB's success
make yesterday's changes seem charged with significance. Mr Rudloff was in
charge throughout the era of expansion in London which preceded the 1988
reorganisation of CS Holding's investment banking interests in London and
New York.
Before the changes, it operated as an autonomous London-based bank, separate
from First Boston in the US. Afterwards, a new group company, CS First
Boston, was created to own operations in Europe (Financiere Credit
Suisse-First Boston), the US (First Boston) and the Asia/Pacific region (CS
First Boston Pacific). CS First Boston is itself 66 per cent owned by CS
Holding, which also owns Credit Suisse.
The reorganisation was intended to end divisive rivalries which had
afflicted the group, as well as to generate more cross-border investment
banking business. 'Those rivalries are a thing of the past,' says Mr Gut
now. But other senior bankers in the Euromarkets claim that there is still
no love lost between the various parts of CSFB.
Could the appointment of Mr Mulford, a former US Treasury official, and a
vice-chairman of First Boston, reflect a shift of control towards the US and
Mr Jack Hennessey, head of the CS First Boston group?
Mr Rudloff described Mr Mulford - a former Merrill Lynch executive - as
'very good on the new business side'. But despite his 20 years of experience
in investment banking, insiders at CSFB expect him to be less hands-on than
Mr Rudloff.
Control of day-to-day operations of the firm in London seem likely to remain
in the hands of Mr Allen Wheat. Hired from Bankers Trust in 1990 to head
Credit Suisse Financial Products, the firm's derivatives unit, he is now
also head of trading in London. Mr Wheat had himself been tipped for some
months as a potential successor to Mr Rudloff.

<TEXT>
SOUTH Africa's Reserve Bank has stopped foreign investor participation in
the planned issue of the Elfi 5 stock, a main capital market instrument.
The Reserve Bank is concerned that high coupons on Elfis were damaging the
balance of payments.
Elfi (equity-linked fixed interest) instruments, issued by Transnet, the
state transport utility, are linked to the All Share index on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Mr Johan Van Schoor, treasury manager at Transnet, said about 30 per cent of
the Elfi III and IV issues were held by foreigners. He said this meant a
potential outflow, in interest payments, of about R75m a year.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Three further sterling issues dominate
activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER supply in the sterling bond market dominated activity yesterday,
with three more issues totalling Pounds 350m.
Demand remains generally strong, particularly among UK investors who are
keen to improve their returns by buying some higher yielding assets,
following the sharp declines in UK interest rates.
Rank Organisation's Pounds 100m issue of bonds due 2000 sold out rapidly,
due to the pricing of the issue at a yield spread of 140 basis points over
the comparable gilt. Investors felt that the margin was an attractive reward
for taking a single-A rated asset, and UK institutions rushed to buy paper.
The spread of the deal, arranged by Barclays de Zoete Wedd, tightened by
about five basis points. The bonds are callable at any time at the higher of
par or the yield of the 9 per cent gilt due 2000.
Rank is using the proceeds of the issue to pay off more expensive bank debt.
In contrast, a Pounds 100m issue for Commerzbank, due December 1998, proved
difficult to sell. The issue was priced at 37 basis points over the 7 1/4
per cent gilt due 1998, which appeared tightly priced compared with
secondary market levels, dealers said.
However, the chances of getting the deal away slimmed, when a Pounds 150m
deal for Bayerische Hypobank, a similarly-rated German bank, was launched at
a spread of 50 basis points over the same gilt. By the end of trading, the
Commerzbank deal, arranged by Credit Suisse First Boston, had not broken
syndicate.
Both banks raised the funds for their sterling-based operations, bankers
said.
Meanwhile, JP Morgan is believed to be arranging a Pounds 100m issue for
Carlsberg, and other offerings, especially for UK companies keen to lock in
lower interest rates, are also in the pipeline.
Great Belt, the Danish state-owned tunnel link developer, launched a Y35bn
issue of five-year Eurobonds led by Daiwa Europe, and also brought a
DKr1.5bn issue of 10-year zero coupon bonds, arranged by Kidder Peabody.
In the dollar sector, Copene, the Brazilian petrochemical producer launched
a Dollars 50m five-year deal, which was subsequently increased to Dollars
65m. The issue, the borrower's second in the Eurobond market, was able to go
ahead despite recent uncertainty over the Brazilian government's stability.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Anglovaal holds dividend as
earnings fall slightly

<TEXT>
ANGLOVAAL, one of South Africa's largest mining houses, has maintained its
interim dividend for the six months to the end of December despite a small
fall in earnings achieved against the background of very difficult trading
conditions.
The fact that the drop in earnings was relatively small - given a severe
decline in economic activity during the half year - was largely attributable
to a solid performance from Anglovaal Industries (AVI).
Its contribution to group earnings rose by 20 per cent following a 9 per
cent increase in AVI's earnings per share and Anglovaal increasing its stake
in AVI.
Group earnings per share fell by 6 per cent to 226 cents from 240 cents and
the dividend is being maintained at 33 cents a share.
Turnover rose 5 per cent to R4.3bn (Dollars 1.4bn) from R4.1bn, but tighter
margins meant operating profits fell 8 per cent to R344.8m from R376.1m. A
17 per cent increase in investment income, to R26.4m from R22.5m, and a 16
per cent fall in tax to R149.8m from R178.6m lifted net profits marginally
to R221.4m from R220m.
Increased equity-accounted earnings were offset by a larger share of
attributable profits going to outside shareholders. As a result,
attributable earnings fell by 5 per cent to R136m from R143.1m.
Mr Basil Hersov, chairman, said earnings from the group's mining interests
were lower than during the same period in 1991 with both the volume and
price of sales under extreme pressure.
Associated Manganese Mines of South Africa, the group's largest mining
contributor, recently reported a 51 per cent drop in profits. The group said
profits from mining would continue to fall unless market conditions
improved.
With earnings likely to remain under pressure for the next six months,
however, Mr Hersov said results for the full year were likely to be slightly
lower than in 1992.

AMCOR, the Australian paper and packaging group, has outperformed most
rivals in a depressed market with strong growth in sales and earnings in the
first half to December.
The directors yesterday declared a rise in interim dividend to 15 cents a
share, from 14 cents a year earlier. This followed a 22 per cent increase in
net earnings to ADollars 136.1m (USDollars 97.2m), before abnormal items,
from ADollars 111.3m. Sales rose 28 per cent to ADollars 2.47bn from
ADollars 1.93bn.
The directors said all Amcor's main businesses achieved higher results.

stiff competition

<TEXT>
HANG Seng Bank, a listed subsidiary of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, yesterday
reported a 26 per cent growth in 1992 net earnings to HKDollars 5.69bn
(USDollars 736m), from HKDollars 4.5bn in 1991.
The profits, reported on a full-disclosure basis, were better than expected.
They were seen as positive for Hongkong Bank, which has the largest banking
presence in Hong Kong and owns 61.5 per cent of Hang Seng.
But Hang Seng's directors emphasised the low growth and competitive nature
of business in Hong Kong. Deposits and advances grew by only 6 per cent
against nominal growth in the colony's economy of nearly 15 per cent.
Mr Alexander Au, deputy chief executive, said the bank expected a year of
steady growth. 'It is too much to expect spectacular growth year after
year,' he said.
The directors said last year the bank emphasised trade finance and project
finance. It has sought profit growth from non-interest income sources,
notably foreign exchange trading and treasury operations, and from
investment, fee income and rents from properties.
They also noted that Hang Seng had embarked on a programme of
rationalisation. This would involve improving the operation of its 126
branches in Hong Kong, and the centralisation of back-office functions.
They said the implementation of these measures would boost economies of
scale - including savings in manpower and the release of office space for
rental - and reduce its already low cost-to-income ratio.
To mark Hang Seng's 60th anniversary, directors declared a special dividend
of 27 cents a share and a one-for-10 bonus issue. This was in addition to a
final dividend of HKDollars 1.17 a share and a one-for-five bonus issue.

450m convertible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS Corporation, the Australian-based international media group, yesterday
announced yet another capital raising, causing a slide in the company's
share price on Australian stock exchanges.
News said a subsidiary would shortly be raising between USDollars 450m and
USDollars 500m through the issue of zero-coupon convertible bonds due in
2013. The directors said the bonds would be exchangeable for ordinary News
shares at a 20 per cent premium to ordinary share market value at the date
of issue.
The exchange mechanism could lead to a dilution in the interest of about 34
per cent held in the company by family and associates of Mr Rupert Murdoch,
chief executive.
News shares closed at ADollars 7.30 in Australia yesterday after opening at
ADollars 7.40. The issue would bring equity and debt raisings by News in the
past half-year to around ADollars 3bn.
The funds raised are earmarked to repay debt. Merrill Lynch is placement
agent for the securities, known as liquid yield option notes (Lyons), which
are to be issued through an exempt offering and private placement.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Kobe Steel to raise capital via
cross-holdings in group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOBE Steel, a leading Japanese steel company, is to sell shareholdings in
its subsidiaries to other members of its keiretsu, or corporate grouping,
over the next three years.
The move comes as Japanese companies face increasing pressure to improve
returns on investments in the face of a rise in the cost of capital and a
plunge in earnings due to the slumping economy. More companies, which had
access to cheap equity financing in the stock market boom of the late 1980s,
are expected to follow Kobe's example, as the continuing slump in share
prices has forced an increasing number of companies to pursue efficient
investments.
Kobe expects to post Y6.9bn (Dollars 58m) of special profits from stock
sales for its current year to March. It also plans to sell about Y5bn worth
of shares over the next three years. Kobe said the capital raised will be
re-invested in its new materials and semiconductor businesses and used to
cover costs for inventory adjustments.
Shares in seven subsidiaries - including Nabco, Shinko Electric, Shinko
Shoji, and Nippon Koshuha Steel - will be sold by the parent company. During
the first half of the year to March 1993, Kobe sold 3.1 per cent of Shinko
Shoji to Shinko Electric and 4.1 per cent of Shinko Electric to Shinko
Shoji.
Kobe said that, by enhancing cross shareholdings among affiliates, ties
within the keiretsu would be strengthened, and would also contribute to
growth of the whole group.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Japan to ease curbs on bank
borrowing for casualty insurers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S finance ministry plans to ease bank borrowing restrictions for the
country's non-life, or casualty insurers, in a move to support the insurers
which face redemptions on equity-linked bonds.
The decision is intended to help some of the smaller casualty insurers,
which are facing a squeeze in cash flow due to low profit growth, and have a
high exposure to bad loans.
Some Y18bn (Dollars 154m) worth of warrant bonds issued by the non-life
insurers are expected to expire this year. Most of Japan's leading 15
casualty insurers are backed by strong corporate groupings. However, the
weaker companies without group support are expected to face severe cash flow
problems.
The companies' underwriting margin - premium income minus claims and
operating expenses - are under increasing pressure as the premiums have not
kept up with a rise in claims expenses.
An increasing reliance on savings type policies, which are a combination of
insurance and savings deposits, is also squeezing the insurers' profits, as
a fall in interest rates is depressing the return on the insurers'
investments.
A surge in bad loans is also hurting the non-life companies' profitability.
The casualty companies have Y7,100bn, or more than 32.5 per cent of their
investment assets, in loans, of which over 51 per cent are uncollateralised.
Mr David Snoddy, financial analyst at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo,
reckons almost 5 per cent of the insurers' loans are non-performing or at
risk of becoming so.
By allowing the insurance companies to borrow from banks, pressure to
realise profits on stock holdings will diminish, easing selling pressure on
the stock market before the March year-end book closing.
The finance ministry recently said it would allow life and non-life
insurance companies to book unrealised profits on stock holdings to prop up
earnings.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Amic's profits slip to R352m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTRIBUTABLE earnings at Anglo American Industrial Corporation (Amic), the
industrial arm of the Anglo American group, fell in line with market
expectations by 12 per cent to R352m (Dollars 111m) in the year to December,
from R401m in 1991.
Owing to the larger number of shares in issue, earnings per share fell by
15.6 per cent to 617 cents, from 731 cents. The dividend, however, was
maintained at 350 cents a share.
Turnover rose to R6.78bn, from R6.46bn, but operating earnings fell to
R295m, from R434m. Amic's share of earnings from associates rose to R210m,
from R206m, and income from investments and interest rose to R93m, from
R78m.
Of the main operating subsidiaries, Highveld Steel was hardest hit, with
attributable earnings falling by 26 per cent to R71m, from R96m. Mondi, the
unlisted forest products offshoot, posted a 54 per cent fall in attributable
earnings to R51m, from R110m.
Earnings of associates AECI and Dorbyl fell by 12 and 22 per cent
respectively. Although earnings at Scaw Metals, a wholly-owned subsidiary,
fell by 9 per cent to R76.5m from R84m, it was still the largest contributor
to Amic's earnings.
Mr Leslie Boyd, chairman, defended the performance of Mondi, saying many of
its main international competitors were making large losses. He said
temporary machine shutdowns, mothballings and closures had been necessary to
keep tight control of inventories and working capital.
A feature of the year was a review of the structure of Amic. The objectives
were threefold: to make the group more financially efficient; to rationalise
industrial interests held jointly with Anglo American; and to reduce the
group's exposure to commodity cycles.
Although Mr Boyd predicted another difficult year, he anticipated earnings
would bottom out in 1993.

KEPPEL, the Singapore group mainly involved in shipping, engineering and
financial services, has announced pre-tax profits for the year ended
December 31 of SDollars 279m (USDollars 171m), a 3 per cent increase on
1991's SDollars 271m.
Net earnings rose 14 per cent to SDollars 165m. Mr Teo Soon Hoe, group
finance director, said the increase in earnings took place against the
background of a slowdown in marine business and despite a 7 per cent drop in
group turnover.
Keppel Shipyard, Keppel Finance, Straits Steamship and Keppel Integrated
Engineering all improved their performance over 1991. Three other companies
within the group - Steamers Maritime, Far East Levingston and Singmarine -
recorded substantial declines in earnings.
Mr Teo said that the group's dependence on ship repair, accounting for about
44 per cent of revenues, would decline as other sections of the group grew
over the coming years. 'Financial services will see the strongest growth as
Singapore becomes more entrenched as south-east Asia's financial centre,'
said Mr Teo. Overseas earnings would also become more important to the
group.

IMPROVED performance from European operations helped Goodman Fielder, the
Australian food producer, increase earnings in the first half to December.
Despite a static result from its core baking and milling operations, Goodman
raised net profits before abnormal items by 19.3 per cent to ADollars 65.5m
(USDollars 46.7m),from ADollars 54.9m a year earlier.
Sales rose 4.8 per cent to ADollars 2.09bn, from ADollars 1.99bn. The net
profits excluded a ADollars 66.3m abnormal gain, against ADollars 22.1m, on
the sale of the Wattie's business to Heinz, the US food group.
The company's baking and milling division held pre-tax profits at ADollars
43.9m. But the European foods division raised pre-tax profits by 49 per cent
to ADollars 22.9m, including two months' trading from the newly-acquired
Wessanen businesses in the Netherlands.
The consumer foods and poultry divisions recorded falls in profits, but the
fledgling Asian unit increased profits by 58 per cent to ADollars 10.4m.
Mr Michael Nugent, chief executive, said profit margins remained under
pressure, but the result represented progress in a period of large
acquisitions and divestments. He said earnings growth would remain modest in
the short term.

AKER, the Norwegian cement, oil and gas technology group, yesterday unveiled
a sharp rise in 1992 pre-tax profits to NKr382m (Dollars 54m) from NKr92m in
1991, lifted by a NKr680m gain from the disposal of its stake in Valenciana
de Cementos Portland of Spain.
The board proposed to leave the dividend unchanged at NKr2.60 a share.
Aker's A shares shot up 12 per cent to close at NKr37.50.
Mr Tom Ruud, chief executive, forecast an improvement in 1993 by the group's
two main divisions, helped by greater efficiency and cost reductions.
Group turnover rose by NKr3.7bn to NKr17.3bn, but operating profit was more
than halved to NKr72m from NKr152m. Net profit last year more than doubled
to NKr390m from NKr170m, with earnings per share climbing to NKr8 from
NKr3.50.
Aker's cement and building materials division saw turnover unchanged at
NKr5.84bn, in spite of difficult domestic and international markets. Its
operating profit rose to NKr351m last year from NKr322m, helped by
consolidation and cost-cutting measures.
Reduced financial expenses following the sale of Valenciana also contributed
to the advance. The division last year bounced back to a pre-tax profit of
NKr18m from a loss of NKr79m a year earlier.
The oil and gas technology division improved turnover in 1992 by NKr3.33bn
to NKr10.58bn. It saw operating losses widen to NKr248m in 1992 from NKr156m
in 1991 due to a NKr419m loss incurred by Norwegian Contractors, an Aker
unit.

utility

ILLUSTRATING how an outsider can shatter the cosy habits of Turkey's
business establishment, Rumeli Holding is watching the dust settle after its
bid to buy the proxy voting rights of shareholders in Cukurova Elektrik, the
country's best known public company.
On Tuesday, Turkey's newest and brashest family-owned industrial group, an
11 per cent minority holder of Cukurova, took the market by surprise. It
solicited shareholders' proxies in return for a cash offer equivalent to 20
per cent of par value of any holding - in effect an offer for the company.
In a full page newspaper advertisement, Rumeli gave no details of how it
proposed to exercise its voting rights at the board meeting on March 30.
However, if successful, it could presage a full boardroom takeover of the
power utility.
Capital Markets Board, the government's watchdog agency, under pressure to
force Rumeli to declare its hand, said it was considering legislation to
prevent the use of similar tactics. However, this did not stop further
advertisements. The stock exchange has offered muted disapproval, while the
target company has condemned the ploy as 'immoral and unethical'.
It is probably more likely the legislation is not yet in place to prevent
such a share assault.
Rumeli Holding is owned by the Uzan family, and started Turkey's first
private TV station. But the assault on Cukurova, and earlier acquisitions of
two government cement companies and Polly Peck's media business purchased
from the UK administrators, has revealed a corporate appetite hitherto
undetected.
Last month, Rumeli paid Dollars 81m for the government's stake in Cukurova,
defeating the attempt by Sabanci, Turkey's largest conglomerate. Sabanci,
through Akbank, its Istanbul bank, owns an estimated 5 per cent of Cukurova,
and is said to be mustering support from other minority shareholders to see
off the Uzan threat.
Cukurova, which has a market capitalisation of around Dollars 440m, is
described by brokers as one of the few 'truly public' companies in Turkey.
However, with 70 per cent of its shares floating, it is also uniquely
vulnerable to takeover threats.
Fearful of just such a boardroom raid, few of the 140 companies which trade
on the Istanbul bourse have chosen to float more than 15 per cent of their
shares, the legal minimum needed to become a public company. New issues of
family-held stock are now likely to dry up.
Rumeli paid more than twice the price set by the privatisation agency.
However, brokers suspect Rumeli is eyeing Cukurova's asset book which is
'massively undervalued' due to legal restrictions which prevent government
owned companies from revaluing assets in line with inflation, a common
practice in Turkey.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lower prices push SSAB to
SKr165m pre-tax loss

<TEXT>
SSAB, the Swedish steel group which was privatised last year, slumped to a
SKr165m (Dollars 21m) pre-tax loss in 1992 after a sharp drop in domestic
demand and intense competition in the west European market.
The steep fall in prices towards the end of the year meant the deficit was
deeper than the group had expected last October.
However, it suggested enhanced competitiveness, following the devaluation of
the krona, and a promised round of price rises in Europe would provide the
foundation for a return to profit in 1993. The 1992 result contrasts with a
SKr218m profit in 1991 and follows a drop in operating revenue to SKr11.87bn
from SKr13.76bn. The loss per share was SKr2.90 and the dividend was cut by
SKr1 to SKr5 per share.
Cash flow was a negative SKr124m. Lower demand and higher imports from
eastern Europe combined to put pressure on prices in the European market
while the threat of punitive import duties curtailed exports to the US.
In Sweden, recession meant trading and processing revenues in the group's
home market fell 20 per cent. SSAB said the trend of steel prices in western
Europe would be the key influence on its result this year.
Although the year had started badly, with prices down 10 per cent on their
1992 average, the group noted that many European producers were planning to
raise prices from the second quarter.
The group also believes it will benefit from its efforts to align capacity
with domestic demand and from improved margins following the depreciation of
the krona.
It also expects lower energy taxes and reduced employer's social security
contributions to have a favourable impact.

year running
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTOKUMPU, the Finnish mining and metals group, narrowed its 1992 loss
before extraordinary items to FM360m (Dollars 61m) from FM768m a year
earlier, despite weak demand and prices for most of its main products.
Sales rose 20 per cent to FM15.1bn, helped by the weaker markka,
acquisitions and increased stainless steel deliveries. Operating income was
FM604m, up from FM3m.
A FM355m gain from the sale of holdings in mineral deposits and mining
ventures was a positive influence on the result, as were rising raw material
prices which produced inventory gains of FM77m.
However, rationalisation write-offs of FM350m and FM304m in exchange losses
depressed the performance.
Rationalisation was concentrated on the copper products and technology
divisions, both of which posted heavy losses. The deficit in copper products
deepened to FM614m from FM497m, while losses in technology grew to FM319m
from FM212m.
The group's stainless steel unit benefited from a strong growth in sales,
despite weak industry conditions, and it increased its profit to FM349m from
FM201m.
The base metals unit reversed last year's FM120m loss to produce a FM404m
profit, helped by the consolidation of the OM Group.
The group said its third consecutive year in the red meant there would again
be no dividend. However, it expects a 'clear improvement in profitability'
in 1993, thanks to its stronger competitive position and an anticipated
upturn in its markets
It said it would continue to rationalise and was ready to divest non-core
businesses as part of a strategy of strengthening its balance sheet.

<TEXT>
BCE has sold its remaining 4.5 per cent interest in TransCanada PipeLines,
the national natural gas pipeline operator, for CDollars 18 a share or
nearly CDollars 150m (USDollars 120m).
The stock was acquired by investment dealers BBN James Capel and Gordon, and
distributed immediately to institutions and the general public.
TCPL, which has a heavy expansion programme to meet rising gas demand in
Canada and the US, is expected to buy Pacific Gas Transmission, a San
Francisco pipeline company. This would make it North America's third biggest
gas transmission group with 40 per cent of its assets in the US.
BCE, Canada's biggest telecoms group, bought almost 49 per cent of the TCPL
in the 1980s. It sold half the holding in 1990 as it returned to its core
telecom businesses.

PEPSICO said it would invest about Dollars 750m over the next five years to
strengthen its bottling operations, extend its distribution network and
market its products more aggressively in Mexico, agencies report from Mexico
City.
'This involves an immediate investment of Dollars 115m in association with
Pepsi's bottlers in Mexico, which will generate important economic benefits
for the country, among them the creation of 10,000 new jobs,' according to a
PepsiCo de Mexico news release issued at a news conference by Pepsi Cola
International president Mr Christopher Sinclair.
Mr Sinclair said Pepsi had bought shares in three Mexican bottling firms to
increase its bottling and distribution capacity, with 29 per cent of Grupo
Embotelladores Unidas, 49 per cent of Grupo Protexa, and 20 per cent of
Grupo Rello.
Pepsi expects to modernise some facilities and will build a new bottling
plant in the Tampico region, he said.
Pepsi Cola has 31 per cent of the Mexican cola drinks market, up from 26 per
cent two years ago.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Profits slip by 22% at The Gap
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GAP, the San Francisco-based specialty retailer which until recently was
one of Wall Street's darling stocks, yesterday reported a 22 per cent
decline in fourth-quarter profits.
The company, which operates over 1,300 stores under The Gap, Banana Republic
and GapKids names, said after-tax profits in the 13 weeks to January 30,
fell from Dollars 83.8m to Dollars 65.7m. Sales increased from Dollars
803.5m to Dollars 930.2m.
The final quarter's figures leave The Gap's profits for the year at Dollars
210.7m after tax, down from Dollars 229.9m in the previous 12 months. Sales
totalled Dollars 2.96bn, compared with Dollars 2.52bn.
Mr Donald Fisher, The Gap's chairman, blamed the downturn, which was
concentrated in the core domestic Gap division, on 'the effect on
merchandise margins of lower retail prices and higher occupancy expenses'.
He noted that GapKids and Banana Republic outlets, with the company's
overseas stores, all posted higher profits.
Part of The Gap's problems stem from intense competition in the domestic
market from rival retailers of basic items like jeans, T-shirts and
sweaters. As a result, the San Francisco company cut its denim prices last
year, affecting its gross margins.

LEADING US retailers blamed the severe winter weather, which affected many
parts of the country last month, for a slowdown in sales growth during
February.
Most of the major retail chains posted increases in 'same-store sales'
during the trading period, but the scale of the improvements was sharply
diminished from the strong advances seen in previous months.
Some comparisons were also affected by the fact that 1992 was a Leap Year,
and hence February's trading last year included an extra day.
"Sales of consumer products and home electronics were strong throughout the
month with winter storms adversely affecting sales, particularly in apparel
lines, after the holiday weekend,' said Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman of K
mart. He also noted that temperatures had been 'unseasonably mild' in
February 1992.
At Sears, Roebuck, Mr Arthur Martinez, head of the merchandise division,
said underlying sales trends remained 'encouraging'.
Sears saw a 2.2 per cent advance in domestic same-store sales during the
four weeks to February 27, while K mart posted a 1.1 per cent improvement
for the four weeks to February 24.
Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer in sales terms, saw a 6 per cent rise in
same-store sales if February 29, 1992, was excluded from the comparison.
With that day's trading same-store sales for the month were flat.
Among the department store chains, Federated Department Stores - which takes
in Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus and The Bon Marche - posted a 1.4 per
cent increase in same-store sales for the four weeks ended February 27; J.
C. Penney managed a 4.7 per cent advance from its core department stores
over the same period; and May Department Stores a 2.7 per cent improvement.
Woolworth saw domestic same-store sales actually fall by 3.4 per cent.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Belgian bank hit by bad loan
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROVISIONS to cover inter-national loans cut net consolidated profits at
Banque Bruxelles Lambert, one of Belgium's three largest banks, to BFr3.6bn
(Dollars 1.2bn) in the 15 months to the end of 1992.
In the year to the end of September 1991, BBL reported consolidated net
profits of BFr4.5bn. The group had already warned it would turn in poor
consolidated results for the 15-month period.
The company pointed out that its operating profit had increased from
BFr18.1bn in the year 1990-91 to BFr26.3bn in the following 15 months. It
attributed the improvement to an 8.5 per cent increase in interest income
and 'efficient control of general expenditure'.
BBL proposed a net dividend of BFr100 per ordinary share.
BBL identified last year's main problem as the increase in provisions - from
BFr12.2bn in 1991-92 to BFr21.3bn - nearly three-quarters of which
represented write-off of loans.
The group said yesterday the loan provisions had peaked in 1992. It was
positive about the prospects for its international branches.
It said the international network 'may become profit-making again . . .
unless the economic situation deteriorates dramatically'. A month ago, the
group revealed that its French subsidiary alone lost FFr540m in 1992, mainly
because it had to write off French property loans.
BBL's balance sheet total rose by 7.7 per cent in the 15-month period, from
BFr2,288bn to BFr2,464bn, and customer deposits increased by 6.6 per cent.
Mr Daniel Cardon de Lichtbuer, BBL's new chief executive, insists the group
will not seek new alliances with third parties in the 1993-95 period, after
last year's ill-fated attempt at an agreement with the Dutch financial
services company Internationale Nederlanden Groep.
Gevaert, the Belgian investment group, suffered a drop in consolidated
profit in 1992, from BFr2.07bn to just under BFr2bn. It said the economic
slowdown and depressed stock market meant there were 'no major capital
gains' during the year.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER LOAN losses con-tributed to Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
suffering a 24 per cent drop in first-quarter earnings, despite improved
interest margins and an increase in assets.
Net earnings slipped to CDollars 169m (USDollars 135m), or 74 cents a share,
in the three months to January 31 from CDollars 221m, or CDollars 1.01, a
year earlier.
Return on common equity fell to 10.6 per cent, from 13.5 per cent.
Loan-loss provisions rose to CDollars 220m, from CDollars 188m. But the bank
said it expected credit losses for fiscal 1993 as a whole of CDollars 880m,
well down on last year's CDollars 1.8bn setback.
CIBC has been through a turbulent period recently, ranging from its heavy
exposure to Olympia &amp; York, the real estate developer which collapsed last
year, to a sweeping reorganisation following the appointment of a new
chairman and chief exec-utive.
Analysts have also identified the bank as the biggest lender to the troubled
Bronfman group of industrial, property and financial service companies.
Assets have risen by 10 per cent in the past year to CDollars 136.2bn on
January 31, putting CIBC less than CDollars 1bn behind its chief rival,
Royal Bank of Canada. But CIBC's first-quarter return on assets was 0.50 per
cent, against Royal's 0.73 per cent.
Total non-performing loans climbed fractionally during the quarter to
CDollars 3.14bn. The bank said the recession continued to hurt its business,
'although there are signs of an economic recovery'.
CIBC is focusing its operations on three core markets. They are consumer
business and commercial banking in Canada, as well as large corporate and
government customers throughout north America.
Cost controls led to a slight decline in non-interest expenses in the latest
period.
CIBC is the last of Canada's big six banks to publish first-quarter
earnings.
Most of the others reported little change in earnings, with higher loan
losses continuing to offset improved interest income.
One notable exception is Toronto-Dominion, which has suffered from the heavy
concentration of its business in southern Ontario.
Besides lending problems, TD's earnings were hit by the costs of absorbing a
recently acquired trust company.

KEMIRA, the Finnish state-owned chemicals group, cut its pre-tax loss to

Rationalisation, the depreciation of the markka and the start-up of new

cheap imports from eastern Europe and lower European fertiliser demand

THE Mexican government has given investors until April 1 to register an
interest in the soon-to-be privatised state-owned television channels, El
Nac-ional newspaper, and cinemas.
Five powerful groups have emerged as bidders, and reports suggest the winner
may have to bid around Dollars 500m for the entire packet.
The privatisations are intended to transform Mexico's media market, giving
Televisa, the near-monopoly television company, effective competition for
the first time. Televisa has about 90 per cent of Mexico's television
market. Investors will be able to register interest for the entire media
packet, or individual parts.
Of the five bidders the favourites are Mr Clemente Serna of Radio Programas
de Mexico, Mexico City's most successful radio programmer; Joaqin Vargas
Gomez, of the subscriber-only television channel Multivision; the Aguirre
family, of Radio Centro; and Mr Raymundo Gomez Flores, who owns Banca Cremi.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Salomon hit by Dollars 250m loss
for first two months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Salomon, the Wall Street securities house and energy trading
group, fell yesterday after the company revealed it had incurred a pre-tax
operating loss of about Dollars 250m for the first two months of this year.
Salomon attributed the loss to its proprietary trading activities, where the
company takes long-term bets on a wide range of mostly fixed-income
securities. Because those trading positions are directly affected by
movements in interest rates, they can be highly volatile over short periods.
The actual loss from proprietary trading may have been larger than Dollars
250m, because the figure announced yesterday reflects the pre-tax income
from all of Salomon's businesses. They include investment banking, which is
likely to have been very profitable recently because of heavy demand for
underwriting services from US and foreign companies, and the trading and
refining of oil and related products.
Analysts believe the loss is related to Salomon's big arbitrage portfolio,
which employs several billion dollars of the firm's assets to invest in
fixed-income, mostly government, securities.
Although the value of the portfolio can change rapidly from one week to the
next, Salomon does not sell those positions when they shift. However, the
firm has to regularly calculate their value at current market prices for
accounting purposes.
Analysts warned not to make too much of the announcement. Mr John Keefe, an
independent analyst with Keefe Worldwide Services, said: 'For the short term
it looks as if they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. But for the
long term, Salomon remains an expert trader and their proprietary activities
should do well for them.'
Salomon would not reveal what caused the loss, but there was speculation on
Wall Street that the company's traders may have bet that the recent rally in
US bond prices was about to end. As one analyst said: 'Solly could have been
leaning into the wind and expecting the bond market to reverse itself.' In
fact, US bond prices have soared to record levels in recent weeks.
Yesterday's announcement was unusual because US companies normally reveal
earnings details only every three months. However, Salomon is a regular
issuer of debt, and the company is likely to have felt the size of the loss,
even if it may be temporary, had to be divulged to potential buyers of its
securities.
This has happened to Salomon before. In the third quarter of last year the
company reported weak earnings following a big drop in proprietary trading
profits. On Wall Street, Salomon shares fell Dollars 1 7/8 to Dollars 39
5/8.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: France moves to fight bid for
OCP

THE FRENCH industry ministry has contacted 20 medium-sized drugs groups in a
bid to fight off the German takeover offer for Office Commercial
Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines wholesaler.
In the latest example of direct government intervention to protect French
companies from foreign takeover, the ministry is urging the groups to each
take 1 per cent of the OCP's capital.
The ministry is trying to form a consortium to outbid Gehe, Germany's second
largest medicine wholesaler which last month made a FFr1.8bn (Dollars 329m)
offer for OCP.
Dr Dieter Schadt, chairman of Gehe, said: 'Considering it is 1993 and the
start of the single European market, we are simply amazed.' He refused to
say whether the group would be willing to pay more for OCP if a consortium
made a bid.
The identity of the groups that have been approached has not been released
but they are not all French. One of the foreigners has expressed a
willingness to back the government's move.
Paribas, the Paris-based merchant bank, is advising OCP's leading
shareholder, the French Bourely family, which opposes the German takeover.
Banque Indosuez and Lazard Freres are representing OCP and Gehe
respectively.
The ministry appears to be having difficulties generating interest.
Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the pharmaceuticals unit of the state-owned chemical
group, may take part, but does not want to take control of OCP. Laboratories
Beaufour, a medium-sized pharmaceuticals group, confirmed that it was ready
to participate.
However, Elf Sanofi, the drugs arm of the Elf Aquitaine oil group, said it
was not interested, as did Laboratoires Servier, a small pharmaceuticals
maker.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: DSM's profits halved to Fl 224m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DSM, the Dutch chemicals group, is to halve its 1992 dividend after
suffering a 57 per cent fall in net profit last year.
The company cautioned that results in the first half of 1993 would be lower
than in the same period of last year. But it said it could make no
prediction for the whole year.
In 1992, net profit plummetted to Fl 224m (Dollars 121m), from Fl 516m a
year earlier. Operating profit dropped by 55 per cent to Fl 282m. The
dividend is to be cut to Fl 4 from Fl 8 - the first reduction since the
company was floated by the Dutch state on the Amsterdam stock exchange in
1989.
Turnover was down 5 per cent at Fl 8.9bn. Higher-volume sales and the
positive effect of acquisitions were more than outweighed by an average 9
per cent decline in sale prices and by adverse currency movements.
DSM's biggest business, hydrocarbons and polymers, reversed into a operating
loss of Fl 53m last year, from a profit of Fl 68m in 1991. The company
blamed the downturn on worldwide overcapacity as well as increasing
competition in Europe from producers in the US and eastern Europe. DSM was
hampered by the rise of the guilder after the devaluation of a number of
European currencies.
Cheaper east European imports undermined DSM's performance in base
chemicals, especially in caprolactum, a feedstock for nylon and other
fibres. Overall, the base and fine chemicals sector saw a 70 per cent
decline in profit to Fl 80m.
In resins and plastic products, sale prices were hit by reduced activity in
the automotive and construction industries. Operating profit in the sector
fell by more than one third to Fl 71m from Fl 111m.
Mr Hans van Liemt, DSM's chairman, said that, although DSM had benefited
from stable energy prices in 1992, all other factors, such as supply and
demand for chemical products and currency movements, had worked against the
company last year.
The company would continue to work on its strategy of reducing its high
sensitivity to the business cycle, partly by readjusting its product
portfolio, he said.
Mr Simon de Bree, a board member who is due to succeed Mr van Liemt on June
30, cited fine chemicals such as aspartame, the artificial sweetener, as a
promising field with low cyclicality.
'In 1992, both margins and volumes for these activities were unaffected by
the economic cycle,' he said.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: VW looks to changes in working
practices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR FERDINAND Piech, chair-man of Volkswagen, yesterday prepared the
workforce for radical changes in working and manufacturing practices, and
announced a sharp cut in investments for this year.
Capital spending on the automotive business will be cut to DM6bn (Dollars
3.6bn) compared with about DM9bn last year, the company said after Mr Piech
told an employees' meeting in Wolfsburg that job losses and spending
reductions were unavoidable.
The cuts mark a further retrenchment in VW's ambitious spending plans. The
group spent DM9.9bn in the vehicles divisions in 1991 and had planned to
spend almost DM12bn last year.
Although no details were given of where the spending cuts would fall, VW has
announced that development of its new works at Mosel, eastern Germany will
be scaled back.
Mr Piech, making his first address to the workforce since he took charge on
January 1, said the group aimed to make a profit this year in spite of an
expected 20 per cent drop in German car registrations.
The German motor industry was in its steepest decline since the war and the
crisis would continue well into next year, he added. He demanded a
fundamental rethink and said hierarchical structures had to give way to team
work.
Every means of improving results would be brought to bear, he said. Costs
would be cut, component prices reduced and productivity increased. Vehicles
had to be made less complex, with more common components. The aim was to be
able to construct the whole model range on a single construction set.
This would improve flexibility as well as save costs, he claimed.
He appealed for co-operation and said in future, workers would be treated
more as individuals and expected to contribute as 'part of the company
family'.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Heineken boosted by higher
prices for beer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEINEKEN, the Dutch brewery group, yesterday reported a 12.9 per cent rise
in net profit before extraordinary items in 1992, reflecting higher beer
prices, increased sales by volume and improved margins.
Net profit before extraordinaries rose to Fl 463m (Dollars 250m) from Fl
410m the year before. In addition, Heineken realised a Fl 101m extraordinary
gain on the sale of land in Singapore, after posting a Fl 33m extraordinary
gain the year before as part of the same property transaction.
The company said volume sales were clearly higher but it declined to give
specific figures ahead of the publication of its annual report on April 7.
However, the rise was due mainly to the Netherlands, Greece, Italy and to
export operations, which cover 105 countries, the company said.
Turnover was up 2.9 per cent at Fl 8.9bn but was held back by the decline in
the lira and the peseta. Heineken has expanded heavily in the traditional
wine-drinking countries of southern Europe in recent years.
Higher restructuring costs in Spain, where Heineken brews the Aguila brand,
meant that group operating profit rose to Fl 733m from Fl 730m. However,
Heineken benefited from a 'considerable' but unspecified decline in interest
costs last year.
The company's dividend is to be held at Fl 3.50.
Heineken said it also achieved an improvement in profit margins, thanks to a
shift in favour of its international premium brands such as Heineken and
Amstel, where profits are higher, and away from more local brands. This is
an important development for Heineken because the overall European and US
beer markets stagnated in 1992.

AXEL SPRINGER Verlag, the German media group, and Poligrafici Editoriale,
the listed Italian newspaper concern controlled by the members of the Monti
family, have wound up their four-year attempt to create a closer alliance.
Springer has sold the 10 per cent stake it took in Poligrafici Editoriale in
June 1989, when the Italian company spent L160bn (Dollars 107m) to buy a
similar sized stake in its German counterpart. Separately, Poligrafici said
it had sold its 10 per cent stake in Springer for DM220m (Dollars 132.5m).
However, plans for closer co-operation, including an Italian language
equivalent of Springer's best-selling Bild Zeitung, never materialised.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Bull to cut jobs after further
deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE BULL, the French state-controlled computer company, plans to cut
about 3,000 jobs, almost 8 per cent of its workforce, this year after
falling further into the red with a net loss of FFr4.72bn (Dollars 863m) in
1992 against a deficit of FFr3.3bn in 1991.
Mr Bernard Pache, who in July took over as Bull's chairman from Mr Francois
Lorentz, said the group suffered from the combination of recession, adverse
currency movements and the turmoil in the personal computer market, now
destabilised by an aggressive price war.
This year's job losses follow two years of stringent cost cutting at the
French group in which two other computer companies, IBM of the US and
Japan's NEC, both have minority stakes.
Bull's workforce has been reduced by 11,450 people since 1990 to 35,130
today. A third of the next round of 3,000 job losses will be in France,
where it employs about 13,000 people.
Bull hopes most of the cutbacks will be voluntary, although Mr Pache
stressed that the rationalisation plan had yet to be finalised. The group
made provisions of FFr2.4bn in its 1992 accounts, FFr1.4bn of which will be
used to pay for this year's cuts. The remainder has been held in reserve.
These provisions aggravated Bull's financial difficulties last year.
The group saw sales fall by 9.8 per cent to FFr30.19bn in 1992 with a third
of the fall attributed to currency fluctuations. However, it managed to
reduce its operating losses by 44 per cent to FFr642m.
Bull made progress in its debt reduction programme cutting its net debt to
FFr9.4bn in the year to end-December 1992 from FFr10.9bn in 1991.
The group last month received a capital injection of FFr2.5bn from the
French government and France Telecom, another of its minority shareholders.
This cash advance will be translated into equity.

In a similar move, Repsol, the Spanish energy group, intends raising nearly
Dollars 1bn by early next month.
Argentaria said yesterday its shares would be offered to retail investors in
Spain and to institutional investors through five geographical tranches.
Morgan Stanley will co-ordinate the international sale. The Spanish tranche
will be spread between Argentaria, Banco Bilbao Vizcaya, Banco Central
Hispano and Banco Santander de Negocios. UK tranches will be led by SG
Warburg Securities and BSN, for Continental Europe by Union Bank of
Switzerland, and for the the rest of the world by Merrill Lynch.

<TEXT>
SHARES IN First National Finance Corporation, the consumer credit group,
fell by 16p to 61p yesterday after the group ran into financing problems for
its First National Bank unit.
The group had intended to finance the core banking business through a
combination of bank facilities and further asset sales including a second
public securitisation planned for the first half of this year.
However, FNFC's board said yesterday that after a 'disappointing' response
from banks to a proposed new Pounds 100m facility for FNB, it had decided
not to proceed with it.
In addition FNFC said that although it has completed an asset sale of first
mortgages raising about Pounds 47m, the group has been told that its
proposed public securitisation to raise about Pounds 150m will not be able
to proceed without satisfactory bank waivers.
The waivers are required to eliminate technical breaches of the group's loan
agreements which conflict with each other.
FNFC's Board said it will be writing to the group's bankers seeking to
maintain existing facilities while obtaining further funding.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Refocused Sema displays 39% advance to
Pounds 19.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEMA GROUP, the Anglo-French computing services company, yesterday reported
a 39 per cent increase in pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-December.
The rise reflected the success of the group's strategy of focusing on
systems integration with a high technical content.
The profits figure increased to Pounds 19.5m compared with Pounds 14m, on
turnover from continuing operations ahead 12.9 per cent from Pounds 369m to
Pounds 416.7m.
Operating profits increased to Pounds 17.6m (Pounds 15.5m). Net interest
income of Pounds 393,000 compared to net interest charges of Pounds 2.53m.
Earnings per share improved by 20 per cent to 13.2p (11p) and the
recommended final dividend is increased to 1.7p making a total distribution
of 2.8p (2.6p) for the year.
The results excluded a Pounds 15.4m net capital gain, recorded as an
extraordinary profit, from the sale of Sofres, the group's market research
company, in January last year.
Proceeds of the sale were used to pay back borrowings and the group ended
the year with net cash of Pounds 5m.
Mr Pierre Bonelli, chief executive, described the results as a most
satisfactory performance and by far the best since the 1988 merger which
created Sema group.
He added that the realignment of currencies last autumn produced only a
minor benefit, adding Pounds 400,000 to pre-tax profits and 0.2p to
earnings.
Mr Bonelli said the improvement in profitability reflected a number of
factors including the strong performance of Sema's facilities management
business, which is now expanding from its UK base into Germany and Spain,
coupled with the group's 'commanding strength' in specific systems
integration markets.
Systems integration turnover jumped 15.2 per cent to Pounds 318.2m while
facilities management revenues improved 8.8 per cent to Pounds 59.7m.
The BAeSEMA joint venture established in 1991 to bid for large defence
contracts in Europe, the Far East and the Middle East made profits in its
first full year, while Sema's losses in Germany were reduced following a
restructuring.
One of Sema's objectives this year is to develop its communications business
following the formation last year of a joint venture with France Telecom in
civil telecommunications.

RENISHAW, the maker of precision measuring probes and inspection equipment,
reported a 27 per cent fall in interim profits as its main industrial
markets suffered, particularly Japan, France and Germany.
Sales of co-ordinate measuring machines and laser calibration products
increased but demand for measuring probes fell in line with recession in the
machine tool sector.
Pre-tax profits in the six months to December fell from Pounds 4.18m to
Pounds 3.07m on sales up 3.3 per cent at Pounds 22m.
Earnings per share fell from 6.1p to 4.4p but the interim dividend is
maintained at 2.5p.
Mr David McMurtry, chairman and chief executive, said the group had
increased marketing in emerging Far East markets while a new subsidiary had
been set up in Hong Kong.
The North American market was showing signs of recovery and there were
indications that other markets had also reached a floor.
'This leads us to believe that the demand for our products, might now begin
to recover,' Mr McMurtry said.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Skipton hit by loans

<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS of the Skipton Building Society fell 50 per cent to Pounds
4.1m in 1992 as the society increased its bad debt provision to Pounds
42.2m, writes Philip Coggan.
The society was also forced to restate its 1991 accounts to address a
'fundamental error'. Having taken the advice of its auditors and other
advisers, a further provision of Pounds 3.25m was taken in respect of one
commercial loan.
This reduced the 1991 pre-tax profits, previously stated as Pounds 11.5m, to
Pounds 8.2m, and increased that year's bad debt provision to Pounds 27.5m.
Over half the society's provision for bad debts in 1992 relate to commercial
loans. Mr John Goodfellow, chief executive, said that the society had been
exposed to the leisure sector and that pubs and hotels had been badly hit by
recession.
Operating profits rose 30 per cent to Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 35.7m) in 1992
helped by an increase in interest margins and a reduction in management
expenses. The cost to income ratio fell from 39.8 per cent to 32.7 per cent.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Merrett drops to Pounds 0.84m and omits
dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Merrett Holdings, one of the largest agencies at the Lloyd's insurance
market, yesterday reported a sharp fall in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.21m
to Pounds 839,000 for the 12 months to September 30 1992.
Earnings per share were steeply down at 2.76p (10.25p) and the group has
omitted its dividend.
Profit commission fell to Pounds 2.43m (Pounds 3.16m). The result was also
adversely affected by a payment of Pounds 700,000 in connection with
settlement of a lawsuit brought by Names on the Outhwaite syndicate. The
money represented the balance of the deductible on the group's errors and
omissions' insurance policy.
Mr Stephen Merrett, chairman, said the groups underwriting results had held
up well amid difficult trading conditions at Lloyd's, but noted a hefty fall
in syndicate capacity for 1993.

Mr Ian Hepworth, finance director, and another director, Mr Arthur Jeanes,
have resigned; three new directors have joined the board, Mr Ronald
McCormick (as finance director), Mr Stephen Blizzard (as operations
director) and Mr Alan Scotter (as sales and marketing director).
Operating profits rose 30 per cent to Pounds 46.3m (Pounds 35.7m) in 1992
helped by an increase in interest margins and a reduction in management
expenses. The cost to income ratio fell from 39.8 per cent to 32.7 per cent.
'Despite the huge fall in profits and the fact that capital ratios are on
the low side, Skipton is now over the worst,' said Mr John Wriglesworth,
building society analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;W in CDollars 35m phone sale to Call-Net
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CABLE AND Wireless has sold its Canadian long-distance telephone business to
its chief competitor, Call-Net Enterprises of Toronto.
Call-Net paid about CDollars 35m (Pounds 19.6m) cash.
Cable and Wireless Canada had revenues of about CDollars 75m a year from
7,000 customers, mostly small and mid-sized businesses.
Mr Robert Watson, executive vice-president, said the company would now focus
on securing the international business of large Canadian telecommunications
users for the group's subsidiaries in other parts of the world.
C&amp;W recently forged a link with BCE, the parent of Bell Canada, the
country's biggest phone company.
BCE now has a 20 per cent stake in Mercury Communications, a C&amp;W subsidiary.
Prior to the sale, Cable Canada was among the largest of the country's
'resellers' of telephone lines.
By leasing lines in bulk from the established phone utilities and setting up
their own networks, the resellers are able to offer substantial discounts on
long-distance calls.
The resellers as a group have garnered 6.5 per cent of the market since
regulators opened access to them in 1990.
Mr Watson said, however, that business was 'very competitive' among a highly
fragmented group of suppliers.
The deal firmly establishes Call-Net as the dominant reseller.
Call-Net said yesterday that the acquisition and a smaller one completed
last week gives it about 15,000 customers and annual revenues of CDollars
175m.
It now claims to have a larger market share than all of its competitors
combined.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Barclays suffers banking loss - Highlight
was Pounds 122m profit in retail services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOSS OF Pounds 414m in Barclays' UK banking operations in 1992, compared
to a Pounds 68m profit the previous year, was the main factor underlying a
Pounds 503m switch from profit to loss in Barclays' core banking division.
The banking division, which has Pounds 98bn of Barclays' Pounds 149bn
assets, fell to a Pounds 251m loss (Pounds 252m profit) despite raising its
operating profit before provisions by 27 per cent partly because of widening
loan margins and increased fees.
A doubling of profits from Pounds 55m to Pounds 122m in the division's
central retail services business, including its Barclaycard credit card
operation, was a highlight amid either losses or poor levels of profits in
other businesses.
UK banking operations outside branches slipped to a Pounds 139m loss (Pounds
27m profit) because of a Pounds 154m rise to Pounds 181m in specific bad
debt provisions on corporate lending. Much of this was due to five
property-related borrowings.
Losses in North America fell to Pounds 16m (Pounds 223m). Barclays Bank of
New York, the retail bank sold in December, made a profit before disposal
costs of Dollars 42m (Pounds 29.5m). Operations outside the US and Europe
raised profits to Pounds 111m (Pounds 77m).
Business in continental Europe fell to a Pounds 107m loss (Pounds 31m
profit). There were 'very high' levels of bad debts in France and Germany. A
loss of Pounds 98m (Pounds 3m profit) in France was caused by an Pounds 87m
rise in provisions.
The BZW investment banking division achieved a 13 per cent rise in profits
to Pounds 241m (Pounds 214m) as assets rose to Pounds 44.7bn (Pounds
37.8bn). Volatile currency markets towards the end of the year pushed up
foreign exchange income to Pounds 288m (Pounds 218m).
Specific provisions for possible bad debts rose by 50 per cent in the UK to
Pounds 1.96bn (Pounds 1.31bn). Those for other EC countries rose to Pounds
145m (Pounds 63m) while those for the US fell to Pounds 183m (Pounds 266m).
Almost Pounds 600m of the specific UK bad debt charge was accounted for by
27 provisions of more than Pounds 5m, including one of Pounds 240m to cover
lending to Imry, the property developer.
The domestic interest margin - net interest income on assets - rose to 4 per
cent (3.8 per cent). Domestic interest spread (the gap between interest paid
on assets and received on liabilities) rose to 3 per cent (2.4 per cent).
Mr Andrew Buxton, chairman, said the increase in interest margin 'reflects
our determination to obtain a reward which is commensurate with our risk'.
This was despite the bank passing on cuts in base rates to small business
borrowers.
Non-interest income rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 3bn (Pounds 2.7bn). Mr
Buxton said it was 'misleading' to attribute this increase solely to higher
fees in the UK because it was helped by progress in fee earnings businesses
within BZW.
After tax of Pounds 43m (Pounds 237,000), the group incurred an attributable
loss of Pounds 343m (Pounds 242,000 profit). It paid out Pounds 243m in
dividends (Pounds 338m) on a total dividend for the year of 15.15p (21.15p).
The deficit for the year of Pounds 586m (Pounds 96m) weakened its tier 1
core capital ratio to 5.5 per cent (5.9 per cent) while the total capital
ratio, including tier 2 capital, rose to 9.1 per cent (8.7 per cent).
The bank sustained a losses per share of 21.4p (15.2p earnings). Net asset
value per share fell 9 per cent to to 328p (359p). The shares fell by 10 per
cent, closing down 41p at 392p.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: MB-Caradon go-ahead for stake disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Shareholders of MB-Caradon, the building products and security printing
group, yesterday gave the board general powers to sell the group's 25.3 per
cent stake in Carnaud Metalbox, the European packaging company. The
authority runs until next year's AGM.
Carnaud Metalbox shares rose 157p yesterday to Pounds 28.25p, and have risen
from Pounds 26.13p since MB-Caradon announced last month that it would seek
authority to sell. There is speculation that a buyer of the stake could bid
for the whole of Carnaud Metalbox.
MB-Caradon shares rose 4p to 325p yesterday. The value of its stake has
increased from Pounds 536m to Pounds 580m since it announced the possible
sale.
The stake, which dates back to the merger of Metalbox Packaging and Carnaud
in 1989, earns a poor return for MB-Caradon, bringing in a dividend of
Pounds 7.8m in 1991.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: N&amp;P declines 22% to Pounds 80.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL &amp; Provincial, Britain's eighth biggest building society, saw
pre-tax profits drop 22 per cent to Pounds 80.2m in 1992, after making bad
debt provisions of Pounds 108.7m.
Specific provisions on residential property rose to Pounds 88.2m (Pounds
23m) and the society also increased its general provisions to Pounds 10.8m
(Pounds 1.7m). Total provisions were more than double 1991's Pounds 52.1m.
Operating profits rose by 22 per cent to Pounds 188.9m (Pounds 155m), thanks
to an increase in net interest income to Pounds 252.4m (Pounds 213.3m).
N&amp;P's solvency ratio increased to 12.7 per cent from 11.1 per cent.
The society has made a commitment to keep depositors informed about savings
rates, following a wave of publicity that investors with other societies had
languished in obsolete accounts. While the society said it had attracted
over 400,000 new savings customers in 1992, Mr Alistair Lyons, finance
director, estimated the commitment had cost the society Pounds 20m during
the year.

advance 12%

<TEXT>
LIFE SCIENCES International, the scientific instruments manufacturer,
reported a 12 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 18.5m to
Pounds 20.6m, over the 12 months to December 31 1992.
Turnover increased 21 per cent to Pounds 110.9m (Pounds 91.8m), assisted by
a full-year contribution from Nestlab, the New Hampshire-based temperature
control company acquired in 1991, and by the mid-year purchase for Pounds
2.65m of Anglia Scientific Instruments, a Cambridge- based supplier to the
histology market.
Organic growth in sales was 11 per cent, with demand particularly strong in
the second half.
More than 80 per cent of the group's production and 60 per cent of its sales
are in the US.
Most of its borrowings are in dollars, the strength of which helped push net
debt up to Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 2.4m). Gearing, assessed in sterling, rose to
18 per cent (7 per cent).
Fully diluted earnings per share were 9.1p (8.6p); a final dividend of 2.35p
is proposed, making a total for the year of 3.55p (3.35p).
Sir Christopher Bland, chairman, said US business was buoyant but UK demand
for research laboratory products was weak throughout 1992, with no sign of
an upturn since.
The company's strategy, he added, was to become increasingly international;
it is looking for 'appropriate acquisitions throughout the world'.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambro Countrywide cuts loss to Pounds 3m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMBRO Countrywide, the estate agency and financial services chain, cut its
pre-tax loss from Pounds 6.49m to Pounds 3.14m in the 12 months to December
31.
However, the result, prepared on the basis of FRS 3, included a gain of
Pounds 6.06m from the sale of a 49 per cent holding in Hambro Legal
Protection.
Turnover fell from Pounds 93.2m to Pounds 90.8m, with losses per share up
from 0.95p to 0.99p. As in 1992, the company is proposing to pass the final
dividend, leaving shareholders with the nominal 0.05p per share paid after
the interim results.
Pointing to estimates that the number of houses sold nationally fell by 23
per cent during 1992, the company believed it did well to achieve sales down
by only 3.2 per cent.
The loss on the estate agency side was Pounds 13.6m, offset by profits from
the sale of financial products. Hambro Guardian Consultancy arranged 6,918
policies, up 95 per cent.
The estate agency chain was cut from 487 branches to 455. Mr John May,
managing director, said that with a significant revival of business there
were no plans for further cuts. The company was instead looking for
'expansion in due course'.
Net debt rose to Pounds 12.3m (Pounds 11.9m) at the year end, taking gearing
to 23 per cent (22 per cent).
To break even on estate agency this year, the company estimated it needs to
increase sales from last year's 39,000 to about 43,000. On the basis of
sales in the first two months - February was the best month since June 1988
 -it believes it is well ahead of that target. But, added Mr May, 'recovery
is fragile and many challenges and uncertainties remain'.
UBS Phillips and Drew are forecasting a return to the black for the first
time since 1988, with profits of about Pounds 5m for the group this year.

HONGKONG LAND'S growing influence over Trafalgar House has been underlined
with the disclosure that the UK-based construction and engineering group is
to open a corporate office in Hong Kong.
It will be run by Mr John Fletcher, a senior director who has been involved
in most of the group's projects over the past decade.
He will continue as managing director of Trafalgar House Corporate
Development, with worldwide responsibility for group deals.
However, one of Trafalgar's financial advisers said the decision to send Mr
Fletcher to Hong Kong showed that it had accepted the need to work 'much
more closely' with Hongkong Land.
Trafalgar's engineering and construction contracts in the Far East are
valued at Pounds 1bn.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Berkeley makes Pounds 44m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERKELEY GROUP yesterday took advantage of the revival in the UK housing
market to announce a Pounds 44.1m cash call on shareholders.
It is the second housebuilder in a fortnight to announce a rights issue. The
company is offering one new share at 295p for every four already held.
The fund raising follows a Pounds 33.6m issue announced last month by
Bellway. The companies plan to use the cash to buy land. Both previously had
rights issues in 1991.
Berkeley's share price yesterday rose 11p to 371p following its latest cash
call. The announcement included a promise to increase the final dividend to
4.35p for the year to April 30 1993.
This would make a total of 6p, representing a 20 per cent increase on
1991-92. The company said that the new shares will receive the increased
final dividend.
The company forecasts that pre-tax profits for the current year would rise
by at least 19 per cent, from Pounds 12.6m to not less than Pounds 15m.
Earnings per share would increase from 13.1p to not less than 15.7p after
allowing for the increased share capital.
Mr Tony Pidgley, managing director, denied that the company was being
opportunistic in asking shareholders for more cash just two years after its
last rights issue. This also raised Pounds 44m.
This money had been used, said Mr Pidgley, to finance land purchases, the
acquisition of housebuilder James Crosby and to expand the group's
commercial property joint venture with the Saudi Arabia Saad Investment.
The group had been able to increase sales, offset falling house prices and
maintain its margins by purchasing low priced land. It expected to have sold
approaching 1,200 homes in the current financial compared with just 491 the
previous year.
Mr Pidgley said the company was not raising the money speculatively but was
already negotiating to buy several sizeable sites which would enable it to
increase the number of regions in which it builds.
The company, which specialises in more expensive up-market homes, currently
operates in the south, the Midlands and north-west England.
The rights issue has been underwritten by County NatWest. Brokers are SG
Warburg Securities.
COMMENT
The trading ability of Berkeley's managing director to buy and sell land and
houses is matched by few builders. Net margins on house sales of 10 per cent
during the second half of last year are a tribute to the company which is
well placed to take advantage of a housing market revival. Shareholders,
however might feel a little aggrieved that the company has not called on
banks to raise cash, especially as it currently has no debt. It is
reflection of the times that companies which do not need a rights issue
receive a warm welcome while those that desperately need money to strengthen
crippled balance sheets may not risk asking the market for funds. Berkeley,
however, could be looking at profits approaching Pounds 25m before tax next
year on sales of 1,500 homes, giving improved earnings of 22p on the
increased capital. The company deserves its high rating despite a yield of
little more than 2 per cent on the higher dividend.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: David Lloyd Leisure to join market with
Pounds 70m tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN David Lloyd Leisure will come to the market later this month at
150p, valuing the tennis and fitness chain run by the former Davis Cup
player at Pounds 70.4m.
The issue price represents 14.5 times earnings per share from forecast
pre-tax profits for the year to end-September of no less than Pounds 5.5m.
This forecast is supported by Robert Fleming, the group's advisers.
This earnings multiple represents a 5 per cent discount to the prospective
multiple for the market as a whole. Earnings have been established after
assuming a 20.6 per cent tax rate.
In total, Flemings will be raising Pounds 59m through the placing of 39.36m
shares with institutional and other investors. Three quarters of the shares
are being placed firm, and the balance is being conditionally placed subject
to clawback to meet public demand.
Some 72 per cent of the company's equity is held by Leisure Holdings, which
wants an exit and is to sell all its stake. This will leave the company with
Pounds 13.6m after expenses and Mr David Lloyd, chairman, said that combined
with the cash flow and banking facilities, the proceeds would allow the
group to develop an average of two new clubs each year for the next few
years.
The pre-tax profits forecast reflected directors' confidence in current
trading, and took account of membership renewal rates in October 1992 and
the level of new memberships which was now ahead of budget.
The 150p flotation price represents a forecast gross dividend yield of 2.9
per cent.
Applications are due by March 11 and dealing is expected to start on March
19.
COMMENT
The trouble with pricing David Lloyd's flotation is that the closest - but
still not a close - comparison can be drawn with First Leisure, rated at a
47 per cent premium to the leisure sector. Clearly, management that is
unproven in the public arena could not hope to start with a rating near
that. Indeed, given the rapid recent increase in profits, a price at a 10
per cent discount to the sector is pitched correctly if investors have any
doubts whether management can meet its forecast. But private investors
should be encouraged by the transparency of David Lloyd's profits from early
in the year, as so much of the company's income is derived from up-front
subscriptions. These forecasts come after five months of the year are
already in the bag, so the issue is likely to attract a good deal of public
interest.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Bilston &amp; Battersea raising Pounds 750,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BILSTON &amp; Battersea Enamels' decline continued in 1992 with a fall into
full-year losses of Pounds 222,000, against profits of Pounds 120,000.
The shares closed 4p down at 28p.
The first-half improvement in sales was reversed in the second. However, the
West Midlands-based company was confident that a new strategy being put in
place would enable results to improve. It is making a cash call to raise a
net Pounds 753,000 to help finance the plans.
The company is issuing 4.22m shares on a 1-for-1 basis at 20p each. Most of
the board are not taking up their entitlements, the majority of which are
being taken by Mr Roger Foster, chairman and Mr Hugh Gledhill, managing
director.
Mr Lindsay Bury, or a company controlled by him, will take up the balance
and is proposing to sub-underwrite the issue. The result will be that he
will control between 10 per cent and 27.5 per cent of the enlarged equity.
Turnover for the year was Pounds 3.96m (Pounds 3.99m). The pre-tax loss was
after exceptional costs of Pounds 181,000. Losses per share were 4.1p
(earnings 2p).

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Ex-Coloroll chief denies blame for Survival
fall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Ashcroft, former chairman of Coloroll Group, claimed yesterday that
he was not to blame for the downfall of Survival Group, outdoor clothing and
equipment company, placed in administration on Wednesday with total
estimated liabilities of Pounds 1.7m.
Mr Ashcroft, Survival's chairman, and managing director until December 1992,
blamed the company's problems on the recession, which hit sales, and a delay
in a refinancing needed to keep the business afloat.
He declined to say who was responsible for the hitch over the refinancing
which he said he recommended in November. He added he personally would have
taken a three to five year view of the company, in which he and two partners
bought a 72 per cent stake in 1990. He said he holds a minority interest but
is the largest creditor.
Cumbria-based Survival Aids, renamed Survival Group a year ago, was Mr
Ashcroft's first acquisition following Coloroll's collapse with debts of
about Pounds 350m.
Mr Ron Robinson of Buchler, Phillips &amp; Traynor, the joint administrators,
said yesterday he had already received a couple of approaches and was
hopeful of selling the business and its name.
Mr Ashcroft followed a policy of swift expansion for Survival, increasing
its retail outlets from three to 13, two of which closed in December. The
other 11 shops, shut yesterday for stocktaking, reopen today, pending a
decision by the administrators. A decision on the future of the company's 70
staff is expected today. Unsecured creditors, mostly trade suppliers, are
owed more than Pounds 1.5m of the estimated Pounds 1.7m liabilities. One
supplier owed a substantial sum said: 'They were trying to open too many
shops and reduce their stock accordingly to finance it. It's very sad."
In the year to September 30 1991, Survival made an operating profit of
Pounds 64,000, and after tax profit of Pounds 11,000, on turnover of Pounds
4.6m.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: MTL Instruments falls 19% to Pounds 3.7m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MTL Instruments, a maker of electronic measuring devices, yesterday
announced pre-tax profits down 19 per cent from Pounds 4.61m to Pounds 3.72m
for the 1992 year.
The shares dropped 14p to 258p.
The group is proposing a final dividend of 2p bringing the total for the
year to 3.6p (3.4p), payable from earnings per share which fell 20 per cent
from 16.6p to 13.3p.
Group turnover increased 7.6 per cent from Pounds 18m to Pounds 19.4m.
There was an extraordinary gain of Pounds 630,000 (Pounds 552,000) because
the group received a pension scheme surplus from pension funds established
for founder directors.
No further refunds are anticipated.
The group received interest of Pounds 497,000, compared with Pounds 630,000
and the cash balance grew by Pounds 800,000 to Pounds 7.1m, mainly because
of currency fluctuations.
Mr Ian Hutcheon chairman and chief executive, blamed the decline in profits
on a 10 per cent rise in operating costs largely because of newly-formed
overseas sales companies in France and Germany.
He said that margins were further reduced by the exceptional costs of
developing and introducing the new 4000 series of 'intrinsically safe
isolating interface devices' and that the decline in capital spending had
increased competition because there are fewer contracts available.
The group was disappointed by an 'insufficient flow' of profitable new
products from its main subsidiary, Measurement Technology.
In an attempt to correct this Measurement's design and marketing departments
had been combined under a new managing director, Mr Graeme Philp.
Analysts said the results were in line with expectations and that the US
recovery should see some bounce in earnings next year.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Property write-downs cut Ladbroke to Pounds
5.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A Pounds 146.7m write-down in property values, particularly office blocks in
London and other UK cities, reduced Ladbroke Group's pre-tax profit to
Pounds 5.2m last year, down from Pounds 146.3m.
The write-down represented 15 per cent of Ladbroke's near Pounds 1bn
investment property portfolio. Previous provisions had exhausted its
revaluation reserve. Mr Cyril Stein, chairman, said: 'We don't expect to
have property provisions again this year.'
The numbers reported under the new accounting standard FRS 3 were also
reduced by a change in the way profits are calculated on sales of hotels and
properties. This knocked Pounds 34.9m off last year's pre-tax profit figure
and Pounds 64.1m off the Pounds 210.4m recorded for 1991.
Ladbroke, which owns Hilton International hotels, Texas Homecare DIY stores
and various betting businesses, maintained its final dividend at 6.23p to
give a total of 11.15p. The Pounds 121m bill comes out of reserves as the
group finished up with losses per share of 3.11p (9.91p earnings).
Mr Stein, said: 'We have not reduced the dividend since the business started
in 1967. The property write-down is not cash and we have substantial
reserves.'
Operating profit was 3 per cent up at Pounds 252.5m (Pounds 245.6m) on sales
of Pounds 4.17bn (Pounds 3.82bn).
Margins were squeezed in the Hilton International chain as, for most of the
year, weakness in the dollar and the yen deterred American and Japanese
travellers.
Hotels' operating profit (pre-FRS 3) slipped from Pounds 163.8m to Pounds
151.7m, on turnover of Pounds 901.8m (Pounds 758.1m), in spite of an Pounds
11m currency gain. The profit on hotel sales fell by nearly Pounds 5m to
Pounds 38.9m.
Mr Stein said there would still be some profits from disposals this year
after applying the new rules - which made no difference to the cash going
into the bank. Hotel book values had been reduced by Pounds 195.6m, taken
from the revaluation reserve.
The racing division enjoyed a recovery in the UK. Profit improved to Pounds
64.8m (Pounds 64.5m), on sales of Pounds 2.41bn (Pounds 2.25bn), after
Pounds 8m charges for closures in Flanders and Minnesota. On the latter Mr
Stein said: 'We have been scalped by the indians,' referring to casinos on
nearby reservations.
Texas Homecare, the star performer in the first half, suffered along with
other retailers after Black Wednesday. Profit fell to Pounds 43.8m (Pounds
47.5m) on turnover of Pounds 693.8m (Pounds 652.9m). Interest charges
amounted to Pounds 105.6m (Pounds 101.8m). Of this, Pounds 67.5m was
accounted for by property, taking that division's post-interest loss to
Pounds 35.4m (Pounds 12.4m). Capitalised interest was cut to Pounds 7m
(Pounds 147.5m).
Net debt rose to Pounds 1.34bn (Pounds 1.2bn) including Pounds 83m of
convertible capital bonds - in line with Accounting Standards Board
proposals. The devaluation of sterling added Pounds 195.5m to borrowings in
translation.
The rise in gearing from 35 to 53 per cent also reflected a Pounds 340m
reduction in shareholders' funds to Pounds 2.51bn.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cookson poised to join rights issue queue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COOKSON GROUP, the industrial materials company, is expected today to
announce a 1-for-4 rights issue to raise about Pounds 200m.
The money will be used to repay borrowings and invest in business
development.
The company was understood last night to be in meetings with its advisers,
Lazard Brothers, to arrange pricing of the issue.
Cookson will also bring forward the announcement of its results for the year
to December 31, which are expected to be in line with market expectations
for pre-tax profits of about Pounds 72m, a sharp rebound from Pounds 34m in
1991.
It will be Cookson's second rights issue in two years. In March 1991 the
company launched a Pounds 82.8m rights at the same time as announcing a fall
in profits and a cut in the dividend.
A hectic acquisitions spree in the late 1980s had left it heavily burdened
by debt.
Management changes in 1991 brought in Mr Richard Oster as group managing
director and Mr Robert Malpas as chairman.
Disposals have rationalised the group around its core materials business.
Cookson's shares have responded strongly, rising from 122p last September to
213p yesterday, a gain of 2p on the day.
The new management has won backing in the City and one analyst said last
night the rights 'Won't be too badly received'.
Cookson is expected to announce net debt of about Pounds 280m at the end of
last year, implying gearing of some 63 per cent compared to 53 per cent at
the interim stage in June.
One analyst said gearing could rise to more than 80 per cent this year,
taking account of the group's convertibles and exchange rates.
'You are looking at a balance sheet leaving little room for development,'
the analyst said.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Galliford subsides to Pounds 327,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON,
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GALLIFORD, the specialist contracting and housing group, yesterday announced
a drop in profits and a near-halving of its interim dividend. The shares
dropped 8p on the day to close at 39p.
The Leicestershire-based group blamed the damp British climate on top of
inclement trading conditions for an 84 per cent fall in interim pre-tax
profits from Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 327,000.
Mr Peter Galliford, chairman, said the results, for the half year to
December 1992, should be seen in the light of 'the wettest autumn weather
for many years and the combined effect on our employees in the field'.
The interim dividend is cut from 0.95p to, 0.5p. Earnings per share fell to
0.27p (1.56p). Group turnover increased by 3 per cent from Pounds 105.9m to
Pounds 109.3m.
The group held Pounds 5m (Pounds 6m) cash at the bank at the end of
December. It has a comparatively cheap stock of land.

the group's European consumer and building products division increase
trading profits for 1992 from Pounds 59.6m to Pounds 67.3m.
The improvement in the US economy resulted in profits at the group's North
American consumer and building products sides rise from Pounds 39.2m to
Pounds 47.7m.
Fire and safety reported a fall in profits from Pounds 48.2m to Pounds
40.1m. Mr Carr said airlines were not buying spares in volumes and aerospace
continued to be affected by the recession.
The division will be boosted by the acquisition of Thorn EMI's portable fire
extinguisher business he added.
Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said the business had become Thorn's 'orphan
division' because it had been for sale for some time.
Engineering suffered the biggest profit fall, from Pounds 21.6m to Pounds
8.6m. Williams said Pearson, which owns the Financial Times, originally sold
it the military bridge building business because profits 'tended to be
lumpy.'

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pentos to sell office furniture activities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENTOS, owner of specialist retailers Dillons, Ryman and Athena, has put its
office furniture group up for sale as it reported a collapse in 1992 pre-tax
profits from Pounds 15.2m to Pounds 4m.
The group also revealed that the Pounds 3.7m purchase of Wilding Office
Equipment in December 1991, now merged with the Ryman's chain, had resulted
in a fair value provision of Pounds 12m. Debt rose from Pounds 20m to Pounds
44m for gearing of 36 per cent.
The pre-tax figure, achieved on sales 16 per cent higher at Pounds 236.4m
(Pounds 204.3m), was Pounds 1m lower than analysts' expectations, based on a
profits warning in December. However, the shares rose 1 1/2 p to 52p when it
became apparent the company would not announce a rights issue, as had been
rumoured in recent weeks.
The profits were hit by exceptional charges of Pounds 3.5m, for redundancy
and reorganisation costs largely in the office furniture and Athena cards
and posters divisions.
On the sale of the office furniture business, Mr Clive Gregory, finance
director, said Pentos was prepared to 'sit happily until we can get the
right price'. The division was valued in the books at Pounds 23m.
Office furniture incurred a Pounds 300,000 loss (Pounds 3.7m profit).
However, overheads had been reduced by 20 per cent, and it was on target to
contribute about Pounds 2m this year.
Athena suffered from a 7 per cent increase in occupancy costs and lower
turnover. Like-for-like sales in the UK dropped by 3 per cent, leaving with
a Pounds 500,000 loss.
The best news came from Dillons, where like-for-like sales were 4 per cent
ahead. Some Pounds 11m was spent opening 12 new stores, bringing the total
to 117.
Mr Gregory said Dillons claimed 12.5 per cent of the UK's Pounds 1.2bn
market. The Christmas promotion of books outside the net book agreement had
been as successful as last year, with sales up 60 per cent.
Ryman was hit by lower demand from its smaller company customers.
Nevertheless, it managed a 1 per cent advance on a comparable sales, helped
by the integration of the Wilding business.
The final dividend is cut from 2.05p to 0.8p, for a total of 1.5p (2.75p).
Earnings fell from 9.1p to 2.6p.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Boddington's Pounds 26m boosts shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BODDINGTON, the pubs and drinks wholesaling group, topped market forecasts
with a 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 26.3m for the 53
weeks to January 2.
The shares rose 14p to close at 230p.
Mr Denis Cassidy, chairman, who reported 'an encouraging start' to this
year's trading, also indicated that the group was in no hurry to dispose of
its near-20 per cent stake in JA Devenish, acquired during the unsuccessful
bid for the west country pub operator in 1991.
Increased dividends from Devenish and lower interest rates reduced the
carrying costs of the stake to about Pounds 300,000 a year. 'We are happy to
sit on it for the moment,' Mr Cassidy said. 'We regard it as a trading
investment which gives us several options.'
Boddington could renew its bid, transfer the stake to another potential
bidder, or place it on the market.
The results further justified the strategic switch out of brewing and
demonstrated that it had a sound base for continued expansion, Mr Cassidy
claimed.
Fully diluted earnings per share improved 30 per cent to 16.2p. A proposed
final dividend of 4.7p lifts the total to 7.3p, an increase of 10.6 per
cent.
Robust trading across the group's operations raised turnover 28 per cent,
from Pounds 185m to Pounds 236.2m; trading profit advanced 26 per cent to
Pounds 32.4m (Pounds 25.8m).
Further upgrading of the pub estate - including Pounds 4.5m expenditure on
refurbishment - resulted in 34 fewer outlets but increased sales and
profits. Pub trading profit improved 10 per cent to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds
18.4m) on turnover 11 per cent higher at Pounds 83.9m (Pounds 75.5m). Beer
volumes dropped 4.4 per cent against a regional market decline of 5.4 per
cent. Food sales through the 236 managed houses doubled.
Hotel and restaurant profits rose 55 per cent to Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 2.6m)
on turnover ahead 13 per cent to Pounds 27.4m (Pounds 24.3m). Restaurants
achieved profits of Pounds 2.5m in difficult market conditions. Hotel
occupancy rose from 57 per cent to 65 per cent, five points above the
national average.
The drinks wholesaling division, after recent acquisitions now supplying
20,000 customers from 24 depots nationally, raised profits 75 per cent to
Pounds 7.5m (Pounds 4.3m) on turnover 50 per cent ahead at Pounds 112.6m.
Health care homes recorded a 41 per cent increase in profit to Pounds 3.2m
(Pounds 2.3m) on turnover 19.7 per cent higher at Pounds 12m (Pounds 10m).
Occupancy levels averaged 87.5 per cent against 80 per cent the previous
year.
The pubs and restaurants were revalued at Pounds 182.5m, 20 per cent below
their 1989 value.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Surprise as Rudloff leaves chair at Credit Suisse First
Boston
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Hans-Jorg Rudloff, the prominent investment banker who made Credit Suisse
First Boston one of the most successful investment banks in London during
the 1980s, is leaving the firm to take up a position on the executive board
of CS Holding, its majority shareholder.
He will be succeeded as chairman and chief executive officer by Mr David
Mulford, the former under-secretary of the US Treasury, who joined the
investment banking group last November following President Clinton's
election victory.
The move was greeted with surprise by other senior bankers, since Mr
Rudloff, at 52, was expected to remain at the helm for some years. Mr
Rudloff played down the move as 'a totally normal rotation' for a Swiss
organisation. 'It was clear that this would happen, at some time,' he said.
Mr Rainer Gut, chairman of CS Holding, denied the move would involve Mr
Rudloff losing direct involvement in the group's operations.
'He will not be outside the loop - on the contrary, he will be inside the
loop. He will be working closely with me in formulating a five-year plan,'
he said. He added that Mr Rudloff's appointment to oversee the group's
future strategy indicated CS Holding's intention to 'pay more attention' to
structural changes in the financial markets.
However, there was speculation that the move resulted from long-standing
strife between Mr Rudloff and senior executives at other parts of the group,
although such rivalries were supposed to have been quashed by merging
operations in 1988.
'For an investment banker who has flown at such altitude, its not a
full-time job, it's an assignment,' said the head of one foreign bank's
London operations. Mr Mulford, while confirming no change of strategy was
planned for CSFB, said there was a need to 'maintain and strengthen' the
global nature of the group.
Mr Gut, 61, has until recently suggested he would like to stay in the chair
until retirement at 68. But last month he indicated he could go sooner, if
he felt the timing was right. As a German national, however, it would be
difficult for Mr Rudloff to rise to the top of one of Switzerland's largest
financial groups.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Damage of property slump will continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROPERTY lending was the most conspicuous, if not the most important, cause
of Barclays' problems last year.
Barclays was a principal banker to companies such as Rosehaugh, Mountleigh,
Speyhawk, Heron, Olympia &amp; York and Imry. The write-down on Imry alone was
Pounds 240m, one of the largest provisions in banking history.
The pain is not yet over. Barclays, which yesterday provided against 10 per
cent of its Pounds 7.7bn UK property and construction loan book, expects to
take more, if smaller, provisions next year.
Barclays, the largest lender to UK property, may be worse-placed than its
peers, but it is not alone. The banks which together lent some Pounds 40bn
to UK property are expected to write off billions of pounds between them.
Estimates of banks' total provisions against property loans range widely.
More sanguine commentators point out that at least half of the banks'
property debt was agreed before 1988.
But the banks have a disproportionately high exposure to unlet buildings and
development sites, which are worth a small fraction of their value a few
years ago. This suggests the assets that make up the banks' security may
have fallen by far more than 40 per cent, the average fall in commercial
property values since May 1989.
Banks have considerable discretion in the extent of provisioning, which
largely depends on their view of a company's prospects. Many advisers
believe banks are not fully provisioning, partly because they want to spread
the damage over time and partly because they have insufficient resources to
devote to sorting out their bad property loans. 'A lot of banks are sitting
on problems. They are not even looking at them' says Mr Richard Millward of
Kleinwort Benson's workout unit.
But provisions against property loans may be the tip of the iceberg for
banks. A bigger problem is the the effect on their collateral, since
property is the security against the huge majority of banks loans. The
damage inflicted by the collapse in property values is far deeper than the
provisions against property loans may suggest.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Philips falls into Fl 900m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   EINDHOVEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch electronics group, swung into heavy losses last year as
the deep malaise in consumer electronics forced it to make large provisions
for a new round of restructuring. The company is to omit its dividend for
the third consecutive year.
The 1992 net loss of Fl 900m (Pounds 337m) reflects restructuring provisions
of Fl 1.2bn and represents a reversal from the previous year's net profit of
Fl 1.1bn.
Citing 'unprecedented' conditions on the recession-ridden market for
consumer electronics, Philips said it planned to cut 10,000 to 15,000 jobs
at its consumer electronics business, its components division and Grundig,
its loss-making, 31.6 per cent-owned German affiliate.
The latest round of heavy restructuring provisions is the second since Mr
Jan Timmer assumed the presidency in mid-1990 and launched his 'Centurion'
programme of streamlining the company. Mr Timmer said yesterday that the
operation was already proving successful in spite of the return to the red.
'We believe that changes are taking place swiftly and that Centurion is
working,' he said.
Mr Timmer noted that price declines and currency movements trimmed Fl 1.95bn
from turnover, yet operating profit excluding Grundig fell by just Fl 463m.
The group made no predictions for 1993, as much depended on prices of
consumer electronics and the speed of carrying out restructuring. However,
sales were expected to be flat. In 1992, turnover on a comparable basis rose
2 per cent to Fl 58.5bn in spite of a 3 per cent decline in sales prices in
local currencies.
Consumer electronics, which faced an average price decline of 6 per cent,
posted an operating loss of Fl 553m before provisions, compared with an
operating profit of Fl 277m the year before. Grundig accounted for Fl 193m
of the loss.
Overall, Grundig, which until now had been managed at arms length from its
Dutch parent, cost Philips Fl 484m in 1992, including Fl 200m in
restructuring charges and Fl 63m in fixed dividend payments to the Grundig
Foundation in Germany.
Lighting was the only one of Philips' four businesses to see an overall
improvement last year, with operating profit rising to Fl 972m from Fl 783.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Buy-out by Williams as profits rise 21%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAMS Holdings yesterday announced the acquisition of Thorn EMI's
portable fire extinguisher business for Pounds 41m as it reported a 21 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits for the year to December 31.
Profits from the industrial conglomerate rose from Pounds 133.2m to Pounds
161.3m as sales edged up to Pounds 1.03bn from Pounds 1bn.
The comparative figures were restated because the latest accounting
standards require profits or losses from disposals to be taken above the
line. Under the old rules Williams would have reported a fall in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 167.3m to Pounds 155.2m.
In order to keep borrowings down, Williams funded its acquisition by placing
new shares at 345p. Its shares yesterday fell 5p to 355p. Net debt is around
Pounds 170m, representing gearing of just under 40 per cent.
However, with long-term borrowing facilities of Dollars 370m (Pounds 255m)
Mr Nigel Rudd, chairman, said Williams was 'ideally positioned to continue
to expand through infill acquisitions without going back to the market'.
Since October 1991 the group has spent more than Pounds 65m on acquisitions.
It expanded its range of brands for the DIY market by buying Hunting
Specialist Coatings, which trades principally as Hammerite, for Pounds 17m.
The profit before tax is after an exceptional credit of Pounds 6.1m,
representing a loss of Pounds 5m on the disposal of Spencer Clark Metal
Industries and a book profit of Pounds 11.1m on the sale of its investment
in Racal Electronics.
In 1991, on a comparable basis, there was an exceptional net charge of
Pounds 34.1m, comprising a Pounds 20.8m deficit on disposals of discontinued
activities and Pounds 13.3m in respect of the bid costs for and the
write-down of its investment in Racal.
The group will no longer offer post retirement medical benefits to its US
employees because of spiralling medical costs.
Although companies do not have to reflect the costs in their accounts until
1994 Williams decided to adopt the new rules in 1993. This likely to lead to
an additional charge to pre-tax profits of between Pounds 3.5m and Pounds
4.5m.
Earnings per share rose to 19.1p (from 15.2p). The final dividend is
increased to 7.5p (from 7.35p) giving a total of 12.5p (up from 12.35p).

FT  05 MAR 93 / Bankers called to account for investor unease: Barclays to
balance its portfolio and make managers responsible for credit risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Peter Middleton, Barclays' deputy chairman, had a simple answer
yesterday to the question of why the bank had not changed its senior
management as a result of making a Pounds 242m pre-tax loss. 'There have
been some management changes at the top. This was my first year,' he said
with a chuckle.
Such sentiments did nothing to comfort the man sitting next to Sir Peter
yesterday.
Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman and chief executive, was already
having a difficult time explaining when and how he will split his two jobs.
He has promised to do this because of investor unease.
Sir Peter came to Barclays in 1991 from being permanent secretary at the
Treasury. After pressure grew on Mr Buxton to split his jobs, there was
speculation that Sir Peter might take over as chairman. Mr Buxton insisted
yesterday that he could say little about future corporate governance.
Mr Buxton and Barclays' board had already given the market more to feel
unhappy about by halving the final dividend to limit the reduction in the
bank's tier 1 capital ratio. This was in spite of earlier indications that
1993 would provide enough of a recovery to maintain the final dividend.
Yet first indications were that the dividend cut had not increased investor
dissatisfaction with Barclays' management.
'I don't think it will have a direct effect on Buxton's position,' said one
fund manager, 'He was around when the lending was made, but you can't blame
one man alone'.
Other investors will take convincing that the internal culture and controls
that allowed Barclays to make so many bad loans related to UK property and
construction are being changed. The UK property and construction sectors
account for more than 40 per cent of domestic bank provisions of Pounds
1.96bn.
The fact that Mr Buxton was managing director when much of this lending was
made has led to ill-feeling.
'I feel very strongly about the fiefdom at Barclays,' says one investor.
'Buxton played a crucial role in setting the strategy in the 1980s, but
there does not seem to be accountability.'
Mr Buxton himself put a rather different interpretation on his involvement
in this lending yesterday.
'I was clearly involved in the decisions that came to the board, but credit
decisions were not a board matter. I was not on the credit side of the bank
during that period,' he said.
Barclays has taken some steps to allocate responsibility for the past. It
has reviewed all loans of more than Pounds 250,000 which went wrong, and
managers involved in more than their fair share of poor lending have been
warned. 'Some careers have suffered,' said Mr Buxton.
Yet the bank has faced a difficulty in altering the past for two reasons.
One is that the bank encouraged lending growth before and after a Pounds
922m rights issue in 1988. 'If we fired everybody who made a bad loan, we
would be a very small bank,' said Mr Peter Wood, Barclays' finance director.
The second reason is that high exposure to the property and construction
sectors was a tradition in the bank before the problem period of the late
1980s. When Sir John Quinton, the former chairman, sanctioned an expansion,
the property sector was the natural place for the bank to start.
The cost of this strategy was made clear in the figures yesterday. Compared
with National Westminster's Pounds 1.6bn specific bad debt provision for
last year, which was spread across many sectors with 47 per cent on loans of
under Pounds 50,000, Barclays' bad debt was boosted by more poor large
loans.
Almost Pounds 600m of the UK specific charge of Pounds 1.96bn was created by
27 loans of more than Pounds 5m. This figure includes Barclays' single
provision of Pounds 240m on a Pounds 422m loan to the property developer
Imry. The Imry loss was made worse because the bank failed to syndicate its
loans.
Mr Buxton does not believe the lesson is that Barclays should reduce its
future exposure to property lending to proportions held by other banks. But
he thinks the bank must instead rely less on the residual valuations of
property schemes based on what they might earn when completed.
The biggest reform that has sprung from the problems is a change in the
system of assessing risk, and balancing the bank's lending portfolio. Both
tasks used to be carried out by a central advances department, which had to
assess large corporate loans after they had been proposed.
The first problem with this system was that there was too little analysis of
the balance of the portfolio, allowing property loans to grow
disproportionately.
The bank has just appointed Mr Alan Brown to the new post of director of
credit policy to reinforce its analysis of the portfolio.
The second problem was that managers in branch banking had little incentive
to be careful about corporate loans. Because the central department assessed
credit away from the point at which loans were made, responsibility was
diffused and nobody was individually accountable.
Barclays is trying to alter this by ensuring that line managers who make
loans are also responsible for credit risk.
'There was not enough responsibility for individual accounts. If someone is
really put in charge of a loan, he jolly well makes sure he carries it
through,' said Mr Buxton.
The underlying question is whether this type of reform will convince
investors that the pain of the dividend cut is worth bearing in the
expectation that management will improve.
Mr Buxton is not offering much hope of a substantial recovery this year, and
emphasises the uncertainty of bad debts.
The problem he faces is that reforms of credit assessment and the balance of
lending will not take effect for several years yet because of the lag in
loans going wrong.
There is plenty of scope yet for questions about Barclays' senior management
structure before such effects are seen.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Maastricht amendment rejected: Government relief as move to
wreck ratification is thrown out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT breathed a collective sigh of relief last night when an
amendment that threatened to wreck ratification of the Maastricht treaty was
ruled out of order.
The decision by Mr Michael Morris, the deputy speaker, represents a serious
setback for the Conservative Euro-sceptic faction, who saw the amendment as
their best chance of sinking the treaty.
But it does not halt debate in the near future of another Labour change to
the bill that, if passed, could force the government to choose between
accepting the social chapter or abandoning the treaty.
The amendment thrown out yesterday, tabled by Labour's Mr Calum Macdonald,
aimed to remove the entire social protocol from the treaty, including
Britain's 'opt-out', thereby implicitly forcing a full renegotiation of the
pact.
Mr Morris has yet to rule on the Labour leadership's amendment, tabled on
Wednesday, which could be heard later this month.
Nonetheless, yesterday's ruling has taken the pressure off the government
after days of it looking extremely vulnerable to a defeat that would have
had disastrous ramifications for its European policy.
Additional respite came when a widely anticipated row in the Tory backbench
1922 committee over Maastricht policy failed to materialise.
In spite of these developments, ministers remain highly sensitive to opinion
among rightwing Euro-sceptic rebels.
Mr George Robertson, Labour spokesman on European affairs, said there was a
Tory 'chasm' over Maastricht: 'The Conservative party is a shambles, a
rabble out of control, without the slightest atom of knowledge of where they
are going to go on Europe, or, indeed, anywhere else.'
He charged that the government failed at Maastricht to ensure that bodies
such as the European parliament had enough powers to counter the strength of
'crude market forces and faceless bureaucrats and bankers'.
Mr Robertson faced down complaints from Tory Euro-sceptics that the basic
unity between the front benches over Maastricht made the Commons debate 'a
sham'.
Elsewhere ministers are going on the offensive against their backbench
critics on Europe.
In a speech to businessmen in Westminster yesterday Mr William Waldegrave,
the public services minister, condemned opponents of the treaty as
'flat-earthers' and told Conservative backbenchers to stop squabbling like
children.
'Of course Maastricht is a compromise - every deal one does with one's
partners always is - but it is the best on offer and much better than its
predecessor, the Single European Act,' the minister said.
He was later taken to task over his comments on BBC television by Tory
Euro-rebel Sir Teddy Taylor, who told him: 'Abuse doesn't solve anything,'
adding that the opponents of the Maastricht treaty are 'reluctant rebels. We
want to work together with the party'.
Mr Waldegrave's strong comments came on the eve of two further attacks on
the governments' backbench critics, expected to be similarly robust.
Mr Douglas Hurd and Mr Kenneth Clarke are both due to use the Conservative
Central Council meeting in Harrogate today to launch new assaults on the
party's dissidents.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Flat-owners gain aid to cover terrorism insurance risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLAT-OWNERS IN London and other large cities will face only marginally
higher insurance premiums to cover the cost of possible terrorist damage to
large apartment blocks, the government announced yesterday.
Increases will be less than was originally feared because both insurers and
the government have agreed to cover more of the potential risk.
'It is very much a compromise, with the main beneficiaries being flat-owners
and tenants,' said Mr Tony Baker, manager of public affairs at the
Association of British Insurers.
Increases in premiums would be likely to amount to about Pounds 10 per year
compared with Pounds 100 a year predicted earlier this year.
Insurers had originally insisted that owners of large blocks of flats buy
terrorism insurance from a new mutual company, Pool Re, in the same way as
other commercial property owners.
Pool Re, a mutual formed by the insurance industry, will officially open for
business in May. It will meet all claims up to an amount equal to its total
annual premium income, with the government reinsuring most claims in excess
of this amount.
Terrorism cover was withdrawn from standard commercial insurance policies
last November, following concern about the potential losses from the IRA's
mainland bombing campaign.
Under the arrangements, insurers will provide terrorism cover for all blocks
of flats worth Pounds 2.5m or less - as well as the first Pounds 2.5m of
other blocks - as part of standard property policies.
Owners of more expensive properties in London will pay only 1p per Pounds
100 ( 1/2 p outside London) for their terrorism insurance, compared with a
maximum figure of 9p per Pounds 100 for other commercial property owners.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary said: 'These arrangements
. . . represent a significantly more modest contribution from policy holders
than previously envisaged.'
Mr Baker claimed the government was 'more exposed' as a reinsurer because of
the change.
Separately, insurers have downgraded their own estimates of the cost of bomb
damage in the City last April to Pounds 350m, less than 50 per cent of the
Pounds 800m estimate claimed only a few weeks ago.
Mr Baker said claims on loss of rental and business interruption policies
were now expected to be about Pounds 100m, while property damage would total
a further Pounds 250m.
Many of the more than 250 businesses affected by the City bomb had reduced
claims by finding cheaper office space, and the downturn in the construction
industry had reduced rebuilding costs. It had also not been necessary to
demolish as many buildings as previously feared.
The new figures 'had emerged over the last few weeks' as insurance companies
finalised year-end figures.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Wandsworth to get more than 8% of council tax relief funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative-controlled London borough of Wandsworth is to get Pounds
28m of the Pounds 340m national budget for transitional relief to ease the
introduction of the council tax.
Wandsworth, with 0.5 per cent of the population of England, is to receive
more than 8 per cent of the money, it emerged yesterday. The borough, which
announced its council tax levels for 1993-94, will qualify for more than
Pounds 28m of the Pounds 340m budget provided for transitional relief by the
Department of the Environment.
Its residents will pay what is likely to be one of the lowest council tax
rates in the country, at an average of Pounds 145 for a band D house - worth
between Pounds 68,000 and Pounds 88,000.
The average Band D council tax bill for England is likely to be around
Pounds 550, according to a survey carried out by Public Finance and
Accountancy magazine and Channel 4 News. The survey is based on tax figures
adopted or recommended by 410 of the 419 local authorities in England.
A further Pounds 9.5m of transitional relief will go to Westminster, another
Conservative-controlled London borough, to hold the Band D tax down to
Pounds 202. The boroughs - regarded as Tory flagship councils - will
together account for more than 11 per cent of the transitional relief total.
The Environment Department confirmed yesterday that Wandsworth would have
swallowed a bigger share of transitional relief if the rules had not been
hurriedly changed to stop the borough setting a budget to maximise the
relief it received.
The rules for transitional relief, announced last November by Mr Michael
Howard, the environment secretary, were meant to limit to Pounds 130 a year
the maximum increase band D households will have to pay over their last poll
tax bill.
However, it became apparent that Wandsworth planned to increase its budget
by much more than was necessary to maintain services at last year's levels,
using transitional relief to hold down household bills. Since Wandsworth had
levied a zero poll tax for the past two years, the maximum council tax
payable in a Band D home would be Pounds 130 - with transitional relief
paying any extra.
The cost of the transitional relief for Wandsworth would have been Pounds
35m, pushing the total bill for the relief over its cash limit. To avoid
this, the transitional relief paid to Wandsworth was capped by changes to
the rules notified to local authority chief executives on Monday.
Though the change will in theory apply to every council, officials do not
expect more than one or two to be affected in practice.
Mr Jack Straw, Labour's environment spokesman, accused Wandsworth council of
trying to use taxpayers' money to improve services to boost the
Conservatives' chances of survival in the London borough elections next
year.

FT  05 MAR 93 / BP strikes biggest UK oil find for five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE largest UK oil discovery for five years was announced yesterday by
British Petroleum. It is likely to open up exploration in an important new
area, west of the Shetland Isles.
The discovery of 250m to 500m barrels of oil, a quarter of the size of the
Brent field which is the largest in the North Sea, comes as the traditional
oil sector is reaching maturity.
The industry estimates that development costs for the still unnamed field
could reach Pounds 2bn.
Mr John Browne, chief executive of BP Exploration, said: 'The discovery has
the potential to open up a significant new play in the West of Shetlands
province, although there is substantial further work to be done to evaluate
the size of this potential.'
North Sea oil operators are struggling to make a profit against rising
costs, low oil prices and smaller oil discoveries. 'This is just the sort of
shot in the arm the North Sea industry needs right now,' said Mr Simon
Flowers, industry analyst at NatWest Securities.
The field's development could cost twice as much as an oil discovery in the
rest of the North Sea because of site conditions. These are among the
harshest in the world, with bad weather, lack of infrastructure and water
twice as deep, at 447 metres, as the deepest discovery in the North Sea.
BP's new find is significant because the company believes it can be
developed relatively quickly. The Clair field, 120km away, was the first to
be discovered west of Shetland 20 years ago, but was never developed because
the oil is heavy and the geology of the field complex. BP is working with
seven other large oil companies to exploit oil from Clair using recent
advances in technology.
The DTI is keen to encourage companies to explore for oil in this area. Mr
Tim Eggar, energy minister said: 'There are excellent strategic reasons for
capitalising on this early work in the Faroe-Shetland basin. It is a new
area with great potential for major oil reserves.'

FT  05 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Boddington
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A 30 per cent profit increase from a regional pub group greeted by a 6 per
cent rise in its share price suggests an unfashionable degree of consumption
from both drinkers and investors alike. There were some specific reasons for
Boddington's improvement: a 53-week financial year and higher investment
income from its 20 per cent stake in fellow pubs group, Devenish, clearly
helped. But Boddington's rise also confirms a more general truth: that
running pubs these days can be far more profitable than brewing beer. By
selling its brewery interests and reinvesting the proceeds in developing
decent pubs with high margin foods and designer beers, Boddington has
markedly improved its profitability. Even though Boddington reduced its pubs
portfolio by 34 outlets and saw its beer volumes fall 4.4 per cent, this
division still lifted profits by almost 10 per cent. Diversification into
restaurants, drinks wholesaling and nursing homes has further boosted
income.
The trick has been learned by others, most notably Devenish, which
Boddington failed to acquire in 1991. Devenish's own success in realising
retail profits suggests Boddington has lost its main chance. This makes a
share placing rather more likely than a return bid.

FT  05 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Williams Holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The rerating of Williams Holdings' shares since the summer gets it out of
something of a box. Funding yesterday's acquisition of the Thorn fire
extinguisher business with equity makes sense now the shares stand at a
small price earnings premium to the market average. Its respectable
full-year profit goes some way to justifying the market's faith. Yet
Williams' ability to finance expansion with debt or out of cash flow still
looks limited.
A small asset base has always explained its aversion to debt. Yesterday's
provision for deferred tax on the pension fund surplus - and the looming
provision for post-retirement healthcare costs in the US - will shave net
assets further. A gearing ratio of 43 per cent is not excessive. But it will
rise smartly if Williams funds acquisitions - particularly of branded
products which require goodwill write-offs - with borrowings. Although the
company argues for interest cover as a better measure, the City's preference
for balance sheet gearing remains a fact of life.
Cash flow was broadly neutral last year after the proceeds of disposals.
That should improve in line with trading conditions. The Pounds 84m dividend
payment, though, remains a barrier to building a war-chest. Williams could
always conserve cash by growing the dividend slower than profits. But that
might undermine the rating of the shares. Judging by the small increase in
the pay-out yesterday, it is loath to take the risk.

FT  05 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In retrospect it is clear that Ladbroke's rather cheeky 1991 rights issue
has pulled the company's fat out of the fire. The Pounds 460m was supposed
to be spent developing the Hilton hotel chain, but has instead underpinned
the damage caused by the property slump. However, gearing has risen back to
53 per cent - not far short of that before the issue. If intangible assets
are excluded from the balance sheet gearing is 80 per cent. Shareholders
funds are now almost exactly back to the level of two years ago. Without the
rights cash, things might have got very sticky indeed.
Which is not to say that everything is rosy at an operational level. With
little upturn expected in the UK, Texas Homecare and racing are unlikely to
increase profits. Hilton may do well in parts of the far east, but Japan and
continental Europe will remain difficult. Property income may improve, but
there is always the threat of a further write-down.
The company may regard trading hotels as a normal part of its business, but
this hardly provides high quality earnings. Ladbroke's reported Pounds 53.8m
cash inflow includes Pounds 150m from hotel and property disposals. That has
paid the dividend this year. Ladbroke will be similarly dependent on selling
assets to maintain the payment in 1993. Fund managers may be attracted by a
7.5 per cent yield and a long run recovery story. But will they really be
happy to be paid with their own assets?

FT  05 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Barclays takes the plunge
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Many people will be anxious to kick Barclays when it is down. They risk
missing the point. Barclays is making its shareholders pay for years of
second-rate management of its loan book. But, having cut its dividend, it
may have stolen a march on at least one of its main competitors. Barclays
now has a tier one capital ratio of 5.5 per cent. That of National
Westminster, which has set an uncovered dividend for each of the past four
years, is a skimpy 5.2 per cent.
This matters because there was a degree of discretion in Barclays' decision.
By limiting the Pounds 226m increase in its largely voluntary general
provision, it could have found the money for the dividend. NatWest resorted
to a number of devices to bolster its tier one capital, including flattering
its earnings by a release of general provisions. Its low capital will
suffice only if a sharp rebound in profits provides enough retained earnings
to finance expansion of the loan book in recovery.
If this does turn out to be the banking trend, Barclays' dividend cut would
look with hindsight like a lurch from reckless profligacy to excessive
caution. It seems more likely though that bank profits will only recover
slowly, especially since the second half of 1992 saw provisions rise across
the sector. Barclays has taken a cautious view on earnings retention. It may
thus enter the recovery with a strong balance sheet while NatWest is still
struggling to maintain its capital ratio.
None of this is any excuse for what has gone before. The previous chairman
retired prematurely and now Mr Andrew Buxton is sheltered by the bank's
theory of collective responsibility for its mistakes. As executive chairman,
Mr Buxton lacks effective presentational skills when Barclays needs strong
leadership and strategic vision to correct the deep-rooted weakness in its
lending culture. If the dividend cut hastens the introduction of some
outside blood, it will have served a doubly useful purpose.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Learning from Barclays
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN BARCLAYS raised Pounds 921m in new capital in 1988, the FT's Lex column
consoled itself that, though the issue might lead to lax lending, 'at least
Barclays will soon have plenty of capital to cushion itself against its
future bad debts'.
What seemed a pessimistic comment has proved wildly over-optimistic. In the
last two years Barclays has taken charges of over Pounds 4bn for bad and
doubtful debts, a figure that dwarfs the capital raised five years ago. In
1992 alone, the bank discovered nearly Pounds 800m of bad lending to the
property sector; nearly Pounds 600m was accounted for by 27 big borrowers.
These are remarkable figures. They call into question not merely the
judgments at Barclays but also the framework within which British banking
has been operating.
Take Barclays first. Those culpable range from senior managers who
authorised the lending to a board which allowed them to dash for market
share. Institutional investors could also have taken a firmer line. They
complained in private about the 1988 capital increase and extracted promises
of future good behaviour, but voted in the end - by 95m votes to 11m - in
favour of the issue.
Against this background, yesterday's cut in the final dividend is an
appropriate response: it is right to keep available funds to strengthen
capital, rather than pay it out to shareholders. It would also be
appropriate for directors to reflect on their own roles in this story.
Now turn to the banking system as a whole. The loan losses at Barclays
differ only in degree from those suffered elsewhere. Even the most prudent,
well-managed banks have recently found themselves making disconcertingly
high bad debt provisions.
Bankers argue that, though there was some boom-time relaxation of lending
standards, the real cause of the disaster lay in the economic policy of the
late 1980s.
Yet this is a somewhat circular argument. The boom was fuelled not by an
irresponsible surge of government money-creation, but by a failure on the
government's part to curb the breakneck credit expansion of the banks.
True, ministers revelled in the false prosperity the credit surge created.
True, the Bank of England could have warned more fiercely and insistently
about the risks of property lending. The crucial decisions which created the
boom, however, were not imposed on the banks from outside; they were made
internally, by managers hoping for higher profits in a newly deregulated
financial services market.
The lessons of the banking losses of the past two years, therefore, involve
the constraints and incentives for those managers. Deregulating banks'
assets while maintaining an implicit guarantee of their liabilities has
proved a recipe for managerial irresponsibility. Those managers, in turn,
have been egged on by shareholders unwilling to offer a corresponding
proprietorial discipline.
Bankers, politicians, supervisors and shareholders are all chastened now.
Yet nothing has changed. The imbalances in the banking framework and in
corporate governance remain. It will happen again.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Three men and a recession: Industry leaders in Germany,
France and the UK explain their strategies for economic survival to David
Marsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For leaders of industry in Germany, France and Britain, 1993 is the year not
of the single European market, but of the single European recession. At the
Federation of German Industry (BDI), the French Patronat and the
Confederation of British Industry, talk centres less on how to succeed than
on how to survive.
Everywhere, the main source of concern is the post-unification downturn in
Germany. Mr Tyll Necker, the BDI president, a relaxed 63-year-old with the
creased features of a benevolent chaplain, points to errors at the heart of
Bonn's expensive attempts to revive the east German economy.
Underlined by the annual total of DM140bn (Pounds 58.7bn) in net fiscal
transfers to the east, west Germany is exporting eastwards 'blank cheques',
he says, rather than a market economy.
Germany's main industry spokesman is worried about the damage to
competitiveness caused by excessive increases in labour costs during the
now-faded unity boom.
Smiling wanly in his Rhine-side Cologne office, he explains: 'Germany's unit
labour costs have risen 9 per cent during the last two years . . .
Revaluation has hurt industry a lot.' He worries that Germany's successful
postwar industrial system, based on consensus between management and trade
unions, might prove insufficiently robust to weather the strains of
reunification. 'I see the danger that we will learn only through crisis.'
Mr Necker, head of a prosperous north German machinery company, returned to
the BDI presidency last September, after already holding the post between
1987 and 1990.
He appears to have accomplished one of his tasks: rebuilding BDI relations
with the government, dented under his predecessor, Mr Heinrich Weiss, who
never struck up a rapport with Chancellor Kohl.
Mr Necker believes disequilibrium in the German economy will be prolonged.
'Reunification struck like a meteorite. It will take time for the dust to
settle. In 1989, I said it would take 10 years to stabilise the east. That
was optimistic.'
The handicap of high German labour costs, obscured during the reunification
upswing, is now visible, he says, indulging in his fondness for naturalistic
metaphors. 'When the sun shines, you do not see the holes in the roof.' He
adds: 'Cyclical difficulties are temporary - like bad weather. But if we
don't solve our structural problems, we face the risk of a climatic change,
and perhaps an ice age.'
As part of necessary budgetary cuts for the next few years, Mr Necker
believes Germany has to make big reductions in welfare spending. This is one
of the most contentious points in the 'solidarity pact' being negotiated
between the government, employers and unions to try to put unity financing
on a sounder footing.
Pointing to diminished enthusiasm in Germany about European integration, he
says the BDI is doing its best to lower compatriots' 'fears' about the
single market.
But Mr Necker is cautious about the drive to economic and monetary union.
His priority is clear: 'I would rather have a stable currency than a single
currency.'
In view of reunification-induced inflationary pressures, the Bundesbank has
had little alternative but to tighten monetary policy. 'The Bundesbank wants
to discipline government and wage partners.' This has implications for
Germany's neighbours. 'We were the locomotive (during the unification boom).
Now we are the brake . . . This will cause problems for the whole of Europe,
and this rebounds on Germany.'
The reverberations of Germany's monetary and fiscal policies are certainly
felt in the 16th arrondissement of Paris, where Mr Francois Perigot,
president of the French Patronat, has his headquarters. He talks of
'impatience' at the high French interest rates needed to maintain the
franc's D-Mark parity.
A strong supporter of European union, Mr Perigot, a debonair 66, headed
Unilever's French operations for 10 years before becoming Patronat chief in
1986. He says Europe is undergoing 'its most important crisis since the
beginning of the European Community'.
Where Mr Necker shows coolness on Emu, Mr Perigot terms it a 'weapon'
enabling Europe to stand up for its worldwide economic interests. 'Monetary
union is absolutely necessary. We need homogeneity of economic policies to
avoid distortions caused by 15 per cent differences in exchange rates. This
will give Europe a different authority on the international stage.'
Mr Perigot hints at the painful ambivalence in French policies which have
produced low inflation and a strong franc - at the cost of 3m unemployed and
a probable heavy defeat for the Socialist government in this month's general
election. 'There is no other solution but Franco-German solidarity. But can
we afford it?' He says he backs the franc fort policy, but adds that, given
the nervousness on the foreign exchanges, it would be impossible for him to
say anything else.
While Mr Perigot says he does not find the idea shocking that other
countries have to bear some of the costs Germany faces in overcoming 40
years of communism, he admits German unification could crack the edifice of
European integration.
He frequently complains that social charges on French employers are too
high, but has established a good modus vivendi with the Socialist
government. 'You must be respectful in order to be respected.'
Mr Perigot refuses to participate in criticism of alleged UK attempts to
attract jobs through lowering labour market standards. After the decision by
Hoover, the appliance maker, to relocate its Dijon factory to Glasgow, Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, French prime minister, accused the UK of heading down a
'dead end'.
Mr Perigot is more elegant. To avoid devaluation pushing up inflation, he
thinks the UK may need assistance. 'I pray God will help the English,' he
says sardonically.
Mr Howard Davies, director-general of Britain's CBI, does not give the
impression of needing divine intervention. And he scotches the idea that the
UK is out on a limb.
Back from an overseas visit to industrialists, Mr Davies, with his feet on
an office table, says: 'I've been a week in Madrid and Barcelona, Milan and
Rome. No one said: 'You're going down a dead end.'
'I don't see that we are following a policy of competitive devaluation. We
are reacting to severe maladjustment in the economy.' Mr Davies, 42, who
took over at the CBI last July after a successful civil service career, sums
up the UK's exit from the exchange rate mechanism in September in brisk
terms. 'We followed the first law of being in a hole  - stop digging. It's
not clear there was another way out.'
Mr Davies thinks the gloom about Britain's industrial record and prospects
is exaggerated. But he admits to disquiet that, unlike other European
countries, Britain still has to mount campaigns to show manufacturing does,
after all, matter.
He is far from sanguine about the outlook. 'There will be some sort of
recovery, but for many people, in terms of spending power, it's not going to
look like one.' British companies have not benefited significantly from
sterling's devaluation because competitors elsewhere in Europe are
aggressively trying to protect their positions in rapidly declining markets.
'The problem of the economies of our continental partners,' Mr Davies says,
'is that they are falling off a cliff.'
He puts questions over Britain's employment policies firmly in a European
context. Pointing to the EC's high labour costs, 16m unemployed and
declining share of world trade, Mr Davies asks whether the Community as a
whole can afford the social chapter. He claims other European employers'
federations support Britain's Maastricht opt-out from the social chapter on
the grounds that the threat of jobs migrating to the UK helps restrain
overall Community labour costs.
He spells out his advice to the government with the precision born of long
familiarity with Treasury briefing papers. Room for economic expansion is
tightly constrained by the 'dual problem' of large UK budget and current
account deficits.
If the government wants to run a looser monetary policy to help industry, he
believes it will need to tighten fiscal policy through raising taxes on
wage-earners and consumers during the next two years.
In view of the sharp financial constraints on the economy, he says: 'Either
we have a production and investment-led recovery, or we don't have one. Does
the government accept the political consequences of that analysis?
'The jury is still out on that.' Like the rest of European business, Mr
Davies expects 1993 will deliver no easy answers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S DECISION by the Bundesbank to postpone cutting interest rates is
not that significant. None the less, the Bundesbank's gradualism is creating
something close to hysteria. It is criticised for strangling the European
economy and for acting in ways likely to destroy hopes of European monetary
union. These are serious charges. How might the Bundesbank answer them?
A part of that answer is that the European economy may be in recession, but
overall European inflation is still well above the 2 per cent targetted by
the Bundesbank. The case for easing may be strong for Denmark and reasonably
so for Belgium, France, Ireland and the Netherlands. But these are regions
of an EC economy whose weighted rate of inflation last year was 3.5 per
cent.
Another part of the answer is that the EC is in a monetary policy limbo. The
Bundesbank is Europe's central bank de facto, but de jure it is responsible
for Germany alone. It is as if the Federal Reserve were to stabilise prices
in Texas. Worse still, the Bundesbank has a vested institutional interest in
making the transition to Emu as difficult as possible for the rest of the
EC. The fox is in charge of the chicken coop. Little wonder feathers are
flying.
Yet there is no reason to assume a conspiracy. The conflicts created by the
Bundesbank's dual responsibility are inescapable. It would, for example,
probably have tightened monetary policy more sharply if it had not had to
worry about the European reaction, particularly in the period leading up to
the Maastricht negotiations. Had it tightened faster, it might have cut
rates more sharply as well. Similarly, every time the Bundesbank is seen to
cut rates in response to European political pressure, the longer the wait
until the next reduction is likely to be.
The most relevant criticism is whether the Bundesbank is using the right
economic analysis. In particular, is it taking proper account of the
international repercussions of its own decisions?
The Bundesbank notes, for example, that some 80 per cent of German bank
credit to the non-bank private sector is at long-term interest rates. Since
German long- term interest rates have fallen by almost 2 1/2 percentage
points since the autumn of 1990, it argues that it should be commended.
This argument underplays the international effects of German interest rate
decisions. The raising of the German discount rate by three quarters of a
percentage point last July was, for example, motivated by concern over the
growth of broad money (M3). But its result was to shake the ERM almost to
pieces. The consequent exchange rate intervention led to still further
growth of German M3. It also led to substantial increases in short-term
interest rates in many European countries. The resultant European slowdown
helped push German industrial output down by over 4 per cent between last
June and January 1993.
It is unreasonable to expect the Bundesbank to ease monetary policy faster
than needed to achieve monetary stability in Germany. Should that not be
fast enough to save the ERM, then it is for politicians to decide whether
the way German monetary policy is made should be changed. What can be
expected of the Bundesbank, however, is that it take full account of all the
consequences of its actions for German price stability. It may now be
failing to recognise the strength of the disinflationary forces it has
introduced into Germany via the effects of its policies elsewhere in Europe.

. . . and then there were two. The next editor of the Economist magazine
will be either deputy editor Nico Colchester, now 46, or the nine years
younger Bill Emmott, the business affairs correspondent. The last lap of the
race for the much coveted post will be run on Tuesday.
Emmott, a Japan buff, had been the favourite. But Economist journalist David
Lipsey, who is running a book, now puts both at odds of 11/8 on. Although
form suggests that Colchester's age is a handicap, being deputy editor ought
to count for something.

'Is CSFB's Rudloff the man for the 1990s?' asks the cover of the latest
Euromoney. Alas he isn't CSFB's Rudloff any more. He is being booted up to
executive board of CS Holding, Credit Suisse First Boston's majority
shareholder, and replaced by David Mulford, the former US Treasury official.
This career switch doesn't seem to have been foreseen by Rudloff when he was
interviewed in December. Asked if he fancied a change, he replied 'Perhaps.
But there is still so much to build here.'
Yet it is hard to believe that the chain-smoking Rudloff - the most feared
and respected man in the history of the Euromarkets - will actually withdraw
from deal-
making merely by going to Switzerland. Besides having the market in his
blood, he has been deeply involved in the business regardless of geography,
dividing every week for a decade between London, Geneva and Zurich.
One lucky break for Rudloff, however, is that he avoids the firm's dreaded
move to London's Docklands on Monday morning.

On course for a 500 per cent annual turnover in economy ministers - it is
now on its third in 150 days - Brazil is fertile ground for pranksters.
Their chances are all the better for the confusion caused by the rule that
when ministers go, their entire staff goes with them.
Hence when Eliseu Rezende's nomination to head economic affairs was followed
by a certain Joao Silverio presenting himself as the incoming press officer,
he was promptly installed. The new minister assumed he had been sent by the
presidency, which for its part assumed he'd been appointed by the minister.
But given what some press officers get away with, it's to the ministry's
credit that chemistry student Silverio was rumbled after only two days,
which he spent mainly in faxing love messages to his girlfriend. His last
statement before being led to the cells was: 'I just wanted to serve
Brazil.'

When all his pundit peers were saying Barclays would hold its dividend,
Robins forecast back in November that his employer would cut same. Moreover,
unlike some others, he stuck to his guns.
If Barclays chairman Andrew Buxton is a charitable sort, he should make sure
young Robins gets a bonus for customer service beyond the call of duty.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Observer: No flies on Beijing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Don't try to be a fly on the wall around Beijing's forbidden city this week
 -you're sure to get squashed. Besides red-scarved Young Pioneers on the
prowl with swatters, there are television cameras snooping for any flies
still surviving inspections by top municipal officials.
The purge on flies, together with other blemishes on the face of the city,
is in preparation for tomorrow's arrival of a dozen of the International
Olympic Committee to assess Beijing's bid, in competition with Sydney, to
host the next Olympic Games.
Under banners proclaiming 'A clean and pretty Beijing awaits the year 2000',
the welcoming procedure has been put through no fewer than four practice
runs. And even if the 12 committee members each insist on being chauffeured
around separately during their four-day stay, there will still be two cars
to spare.
But the 14 new Mercedes 280s at their disposal all bear a reminder of what
is expected of them. The number plates read: Beijing 2000.
To enable the party to travel speedily as well as comfortably, local traffic
movements are being curbed. And to improve the city's road-safety image,
bicycling parents have been asked to stop carrying children as passengers.
Even so, reports in the Communist Party's daily paper indicate that 92.6 per
cent of the nation think the costs justified by the potential prize. For
added emphasis, the country's Olympic-affairs chief He Zhenliang has
declared that 1.1bn Chinese are eagerly awaiting the eventual decision.
Presumably he's hoping that if the visitors aren't persuaded in China's
favour by the car number-plates, fear of angering a quarter of the world's
population will do the trick.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Branson and the bounds of silence: Confidentiality clauses
have limits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Mr Richard Branson, head of Virgin Atlantic Airways, is debating whether
to sign a pledge of silence over BA's 'dirty tricks' campaign as part of a
final settlement of the airlines' bitter dispute, he could do worse than
talk to Mr Freddie Laker, founder of the now defunct Laker Airways.
As part of the settlement terms of his US anti-trust lawsuit against BA in
1984 over its campaign against Laker's Skytrain, he agreed to be bound by a
confidentiality clause never to talk about the affair in public again. Nine
years later, industry friends say he still regrets the decision.
Mr Branson says he is happy to agree with BA not to rake over the past, but
is understandably nervous about signing away his right to defend the airline
if it comes under attack over the row with BA in the media.
The attempt to silence Mr Branson and Virgin staff is said to be the only
outstanding issue between the two companies. BA has offered a Pounds 9m cash
settlement and a signed commitment not to indulge in any further
anti-competitive practices.
'In high-profile settlements, confidentiality clauses are the norm,' says Mr
John Wright, a litigation partner with City solicitors Warner Cranston,
'certainly in any case which is a matter of public record, or where a
professional or a company's reputation is at stake.'
Dr Karl Mackie, director of the Centre for Dispute Resolution, an
industry-backed organisation dedicated to resolving commercial disputes by
mediation and conciliation, says they are particularly common in cases
'where there is a risk of commercial damage to a business reputation at a
future date if the issues are aired again'.
Frequently, they form part of a more general agreement that all the terms of
a settlement should remain secret.
'In most settlements of disputes there is usually some restriction about
what can and cannot be said by the parties. It's not uncommon for that to
include a restriction on commenting on the underlying dispute,' says Mr
Robert Anderson, a partner of City solicitors Lovell White Durrant.
Lawyers point out, however, that the current talks between Virgin and BA do
not constitute a settlement. The dispute was settled when BA apologised in
the High Court and agreed to pay Pounds 610,000 damages and Virgin's costs,
thought to be about Pounds 1.6m. There is no outstanding litigation between
the two companies, only the threat of possible legal action in the US.
'What they are negotiating now is effectively a new commercial agreement
because it is concerned with their future commercial relationship,' Mr
Wright says.
The confidentiality clause would be a crucial element of the new contract.
The terms of the clause itself are fairly standard and often signed by
senior executives when leaving companies. Mr Branson cannot mention the
'dirty tricks' campaign again unless Sir Colin Marshall, BA's chairman,
agrees, or unless the High Court permits it.
A standard confidentiality clause would also include a penalty for breaching
it. Without one, the clause would carry no weight. In the BA case, lawyers
suggest, a possible sanction might be for BA automatically to recoup its
Pounds 9m if Mr Branson breaks his word.
BA might also be able to obtain a court injunction for breach of the
agreement, thus preventing Mr Branson from making further reference to the
dispute. Alternatively, lawyers add, it could sue him for any damage to its
commercial reputation caused by reviving the affair.
The knowledge that breach of a confidentiality clause could result in fresh
litigation means that pledges of silence are rarely broken.
But would the courts uphold this particular attempt to stop discussion of a
matter of public interest? Mr Branson has one possible defence to any
attempt to obtain a court injunction, lawyers indicate. He could argue that
breaking his silence was in the public interest.
Mr Branson might also note that if there were further instances of dirty
tricks by BA, despite its assurances, he might be entitled to argue in court
that he was no longer bound by the agreement and was thus free to make any
reference to past events he chose.
So while the immediate effect of signing a pledge of silence might seem
draconian, it will not necessarily affect his ability to defend himself or
Virgin in the future.
'Some people may see it as gagging,' Mr Wright says, 'but as a lawyer I
don't. They are free to enter into this agreement or not as they wish. It's
all about freedom of contract.'

FT  05 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Not honourable
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME MINISTER deserves a modest commendation, but not a medal, for the
changes to the British system of honours that he announced yesterday. It is
right that knighthoods should cease to be automatically awarded to
time-serving Tory backbenchers or nearly superannuated civil servants -
that, indeed, all gongs will in future be pinned only on the chests of those
judged to deserve them.
It is consonant with John Major's view of a 'classless society' that the
lesser decorations, such as the British Empire Medal, until now reserved for
what were formerly called the lower classes, should be abolished. There is
sense in the proposition that anyone can write in to say that so and so has
performed a social service very well and ought to be rewarded; a sound
honours system exists to allow a society to thank those whose valued actions
have not yielded personal wealth or power. It is also true to say, as Mr
Major did, that the independence of the judiciary is protected by excepting
High Court judges from the new rule of merit, although the same effect might
have been better achieved by dissociating them from knighthoods altogether.
All of this is unexceptionable, so far as it goes, which is no great
distance. The prime minister retains his immense and opaque power of
patronage; his reference to the existing arrangements for scrutiny of
candidates is hardly reassuring.
This is particularly so in the case of the retention of honours for
political services, which are not taken up by the Labour party. Too much
support for the Tories is currently paid for by government issue of silken
ribbons and the chance to wear ermine. Yet reform of the House of Lords is
beyond Mr Major's agenda.
Mr Major has missed an opportunity to bring an antiquated system properly up
to date. He appears to understands the importance of maintaining respect for
the honours system, if it is to have continuing value. But the reformed
arrangements retain an unnecessarily antique and hence backward-looking
lustre. He should have been more radical.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Merchant takes stock: Matsushita is facing a fall in profits
and a tarnished image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sales clerk in the Tokyo electrical retail shop was unusually blunt.
'Just because the name is Matsushita, it doesn't mean the product is good.'
Across the city, in a small neighbourhood shop, the refrigerators on display
were covered with photocopies of newspaper articles warning of defects to
refrigerators made by Matsushita.
Such incidents are part of an unprecedented reappraisal of one of Japan's
corporate legends. Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics
group and owner of Hollywood's MCA film studios, has been for decades a
model of the virtues of Japanese management. But with its reputation
seriously tarnished by product defects and a financial scandal, the company
appears to be losing its way. The problems are manifest in its trading
performance. In the current fiscal year, to the end of March, post-tax
profits are expected to fall by more than 60 per cent to about Y48bn (Pounds
285m).
The most recent blow was delivered last week when Mr Akio Tanii, the group
president, unexpectedly resigned after seven years at the helm.
The official explanation for Mr Tanii's sudden departure was that he was
stepping down to take responsibility for 'a number of regrettable
incidents'. These comprised the revelation last year that Matsushita had
sold 700,000 defective refrigerators, and the involvement of its National
Lease subsidiary in a financial scandal which cost it Y20bn as a result of
loans to a stock market speculator.
But Japan's media have focused on the role played in Mr Tanii's fall by Mr
Masaharu Matsushita, the Matsushita chairman and son-in-law of Konosuke
Matsushita, the group's founder. According to the Japanese press, Mr
Matsushita, unhappy at the decline in profits and the bad publicity
surrounding the company, put pressure on Mr Tanii to resign and make way for
the eventual rise to the presidency of his son, Mr Masayuku Matsushita.
However, what the public clearly saw in Mr Tanii's departure was the
seriousness of the problems afflicting the company. At their root, according
to many industry analysts, is a cumbersome bureaucracy. A study carried out
by the company found, for example, that only 20 per cent of working hours
put in by marketing staff were directly related to business. Much work, not
only at headquarters but among group companies, was being duplicated.
The study reinforced a belief in the Japanese electronics industry that
Matsushita may have grown too large to function effectively. With 315
subsidiaries, 138 of which are abroad, 24,000 affiliated retail shops and
24,400 employees, industry analysts believe Matsushita is suffering from
dai-kigyo-byo, 'the disease of the big corporation'.
Even Matsushita managers say they are concerned that their company has
become bloated. They fear it has lost touch with its customers and drifted
from its roots as a merchant of well-manufactured consumer electronics
products with mass appeal.
At a meeting of group executives in early February, Masaharu Matsushita
warned his audience that 'it is no use talking about customers as number one
unless that motto is put into practice. Matsushita itself is beginning to
look in many ways like a company that has failed to do so.'
Such concerns about serving customers are particularly worrying. In contrast
with Sony and its other Japanese rivals, Matsushita has never been known as
an innovator or a trend-setter. Instead, its strength has been as a reliable
supplier of products through its extensive retail network. The discovery of
product defects and its tarnished corporate image have, therefore,
undermined its traditional advantages.
Matsushita has also suffered, along with the rest of the Japanese
electronics industry, from the constant expansion of its product range. The
company's philosophy, propounded by its founder, has been to provide a wide
range of products that are 'as cheap and readily available as tap water'.
However, its preoccupation with launching new models has led to excessive
investment in existing product areas.
'At one point there were 220 types of TVs and 62 types of VCRs across the
industry but only 10 per cent of these sold,' says Mr Jiro Aoki, general
manager of Matsushita's domestic sales planning office.
'When the company finally began paying attention to what consumers were
saying, it found out that they didn't want 20 buttons on a VCR. We began to
question our whole manufacturing philosophy.'
Faced with such questions and with the sharp decline in profitability, the
group is responding. Last year, a restructuring programme was introduced in
an attempt to maintain profits. Technical and marketing support is being
reduced for loss-making and less profitable outlets. The group's system of
extending financial support to retail outlets has been discontinued in an
attempt to cut costs. Distribution has also been reformed and inventories
throughout the distribution chain are being reduced from three months to one
month.
There is also a greater focus on product development and product ranges are
being reduced. The 72 types of Matsushita rice cookers which existed in 1989
have been reduced to 38.
The management is also trying to instil a new corporate philosophy that
places less emphasis on producing cheap and readily available products. To
this end, Mr Yoichi Morishita, the group's new president, has adopted a new
slogan: 'creativity and challenge'.
The company is also determined to regain the confidence of Japan's
consumers. 'Among Japan's electronics companies, Toshiba was known as the
samurai, Mitsubishi as the feudal lord and Matsushita was the merchant,'
says Mr Aoki from the planning office. 'We must go back to our roots as a
merchant, that means being customer oriented.'
Despite such initiatives, the size of the group and its entrenched
relationships with suppliers and retailers are likely to limit the pace of
change. But perhaps the biggest obstacle to recovery will be its weak record
of technological innovation.
A survey of employees at Matsushita conducted by the Nikkei Business
magazine showed that the majority felt that the most critical issue facing
the company is the development of products that are capable of building new
markets in the depressed consumer electronics industry. This, and the
avoidance of any further 'regrettable' incidents, will determine whether Mr
Tanii's successors can restore the merchant's fortunes.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: UK manufacturing would look better if compared with
rivals (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RONALD DORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Roger Lyons gives us a timely reminder that there are people who work
in manufacturing, as well those who own and manage it.
It is especially timely given Tuesday's revealing article on the bankruptcy
law ('The beauty of a vote', March 2). Three clever economists presented an
ingenious scheme for sorting out conflicts of interest among creditors,
faced with the choice between liquidation and reconstruction.
Their unquestioned assumption was that the matter was solely for those who
had money at stake to decide: never, ever, the people who had livelihoods at
stake, except to the extent that they happened to be owed a bit of back pay.
Such an assumption would never be made in our more successful competitors.
In Germany, a public company is seen as a public institution, in the way a
hospital is. In Japan it is seen as a community of all who work in it, not
just a bit of property owned by shareholders. Even in America, the only
other country our three economists seem to have heard of, elaborate Esop
provisions exist to favour the taking-over of ailing companies by their
employees.
Can we really make it in 21st-century world markets if we stick to our
peculiarly British obsession with the rights of property? Are we supposed to
rely on the Hoovers of this world to come and take advantage of our
un-socially chartered, uninvolved - but cheap - labour?

   From Mr TONY THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Before there is any more tub-thumping by Roger Lyons (Letters, March
4), the prime minister or any other of the great and good about the decline
of British manufacturing, might it not be worth spending a bit of time on
examining whether a 'decline' has, or is, taking place?
Looking at manufacturing's contribution to gross domestic product in other
English-speaking countries and France, the figures appear to be roughly the
same as ours. It is true that manufacturing output has fallen in the UK but
that is normal in a recession.
Historically, British manufacturing industry was over-manned and
under-managed. Shedding labour at all levels is an encouraging long-term
trend, however dismal for the individuals concerned.
Better education and a reduction in costs such as taxes and regulations for
all businesses, whether service or manufacturing, is the correct response.
Trying to revive the Midlands' galvanised steel widget industry - by
whatever means - is a waste of time and money.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: Tory chairman unable to block local associations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir NORMAN FOWLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article ('Tory Associations criticise Fowler', March 2) is based
upon a fundamental misunderstanding of the constitution of the Conservative
party.
I am the chairman of the Party Organisation, the professional wing of the
party. The affairs of the voluntary party are handled by the National Union
of Conservative Associations, whose leadership is elected by party members.
It is the National Union that decides the agenda at the Conservative party's
central council and annual conference.
Your article was therefore entirely wrong to state that I had 'blocked' an
attempt by a number of constituency associations to call a special meeting
of the central council. Not only have I not done so; I have no power to do
so. In fact, this request was rejected by the elected National Union
Executive Committee by overwhelming majority votes at three separate
meetings on the grounds that the actual number of verified requests for a
special meeting of central council was well below the 50 required.
The article was also wrong to say the debate on Friday morning concerns my
plans for Central Office. It does not.
It concerns the proposed change in the rules of the National Union,
following the admirable report of the chairman of the National Union
Executive Committee, Sir Basil Feldman, already passed by that committee.
As for feelings about the supposed 'autocratic style' of Central Office, it
is precisely in order to address any such concerns within the party that I
am setting up a board of management, representing all parts of the party.
Three members will come from the National Union and in addition there will
be the elected chairman of the 1922 Committee, the elected leader of our
MEPs and a leading representative of our elected councillors.
As far as I know the so-called Party Reform Steering Committee does not
oppose my action in radically cutting spending at Central Office or in
appointing a new director general and a new finance director. They do not
oppose the establishment of a new Constituency Services Department and
indeed they do not oppose the establishment of a management board itself.
Nor indeed should they. For these actions were based on the results of the
widest consultation with the party yet undertaken.

FT  05 MAR 93 / A vote could set them free
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Britain's political logjam could be broken by a well-tested explosive force
 -the referendum. Both sides could use it. The prime minister could blast
away the gridlock in the Conservative party by promising its anti-Maastricht
rebels a plebiscite when (if?) the government decides to exchange sterling
for a European currency. The leader of the opposition could unite the Labour
party around his campaign for 'a citizens' democracy' by undertaking to
consult the people on proportional representation.
There is one small snag. Both Johns - Major and Smith - are against
referenda. They regard the device as unconstitutional, an affront to the
sovereignty of parliament. This objection is specious. Plebiscites have two
functions. First, they express the popular will. Important constitutional
changes should be endorsed by direct vote. Second, they rescue politicians
in trouble. This is not a wholly ignoble cause. They are all rascals, but
they are our rascals. From time to time they have to be extricated from the
consequences of their own follies.
The 1975 referendum on Britain's membership of what was then called the
Common Market fulfilled both functions. It saved the Labour government, and
it legitimised Britain's membership of the EC. The 1979 referenda on the
devolution of parliamentary powers to Scotland and Wales, also called by
Labour, was a party fix. Scotland voted yes, but not by a large enough
majority to overcome obstacles devised by parliamentary opponents of
devolution.
A party fix would do nicely for the Tories right now. The parliamentary
battle over the bill to ratify the Maastricht treaty is blocking normal
government business. The Conservatives are at war with themselves. A quarter
of their normally loyal backbenchers have voted against the bill, or
abstained. The cabinet is sorely divided; one minister confessed the other
day that he had contemplated resignation over Maastricht 'many times'.
An unwritten, perhaps unspoken, deal has been struck. Europhobe ministers
will stand by Mr Major and support his bill. The headline scares of last
weekend are groundless. Messrs Howard, Portillo and Lilley are not plotting
a Thatcherite coup. In return, the prime minister will cast aside thoughts
of rejoining the exchange rate mechanism before the next general election.
That comforts the sceptics, who believe that the ERM will collapse. Some of
them assume that full monetary union will not be possible in their
lifetimes. A promise of a plebiscite on British participation in a single
currency union would add extra assurance. It would cost Mr Major nothing: he
cannot bind future parliaments. He would have to eat some past words, but
that is a price he may have to accept, if he finds himself with his back
against the wall with the rebels' spears at his throat.
Meanwhile he lives in hopes. He is relying on signs of the end of recession,
plus rousing speeches such as the one he is due to make at a party conclave
in Harrogate tomorrow, to see him through. He may escape the humiliation of
being forced to concede a referendum, but he cannot bank on it. He is living
from day to day.
The Labour leader is playing a longer game. His party's commission on
electoral reform is expected to report next month. Whether or not it comes
out firmly in favour of PR for elections to the Commons Mr Smith will have
to take a view. The one most likely to keep his party united would be an
indication of his personal preference, plus a promise of a referendum. If he
follows the logic of his own recent strong speech on constitutional reform
his leaning should be towards PR.
Let us ignore for just a moment the usual crass calculations about what this
would do for relations with the Liberal Democrats. A referendum on the
method of election is justifiable on its own merits. Voters everywhere are
becoming disillusioned with politicians. Electorates that have been
consulted show that they are keenly aware of the merits of competing
systems. The Italians, who have too long endured an unwieldy list mechanism
may yet discover that the people are better judges of what is in their own
interests than are the parties. In Ireland, for example, Fianna Fail failed
twice - in 1958 and 1968 - to end the single transferable vote method of
elections to the Dail.
In New Zealand the voters have spoken with dramatic force. The two main
parties stumbled into last September's referendum along a trail of broken
promises, slippery statements, and competitive bids for popularity.
According to a paper delivered by the political scientist Richard Mulgan at
the Australian National University, politicians from these parties
'confidently expected that they could draw on traditional Anglo prejudices
against the immobilism and unaccountability of coalition governments and
against the smoke-filled-room aroma of party lists'.
They therefore loaded the dice in favour of the Westminster
first-past-the-post mechanism that has long suited them so well. Voters were
asked to think, first about whether they wanted a change and, subsequently,
about which of four alternative systems they would prefer. On a 55 per cent
turnout, 85 per cent favoured an end to first-past-the-post and 70 per cent
chose the German model, with its mixture of constituency and list MPs. This
from New Zealand, which harbours a closer replica of English society than
any other on earth.
Before he talks of a referendum, Mr Smith needs to think. A clumsy
introduction of PR into the fag-end of last April's election campaign
appears to have cost Labour dearly. A careless commitment to a plebiscite in
the next Labour manifesto would leave several questions unanswered, not
least about why Mr Smith favoured a change (if he did) while his deputy, Mrs
Margaret Beckett, opposed one (which she almost certainly would). Those who
still dream of Labour ruling on its own would be set against those who
believe that it stands a chance only in coalitions. The Labour leader would
have to come off his personal fence, even if he allowed his immediate
colleagues to campaign against one another, as they did in 1975. Will it
happen? Picture Mr Smith striding out in front of his party the better to
lead it. I don't believe it either, but it would be explosive.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: Auditors must redefine their profession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, By the end of March the auditing profession must decide where it is
going by responding to the Auditing Practices Board's vision for the future.
The APB suggests the audit should provide more assurance to both management
and shareholders on the proper conduct of companies' affairs.
But many in the profession suggest the proposals are too radical. They would
indeed be a large step for a conservative profession. But they are essential
if auditing is to retain its relevance to society.
The audit was last defined in the 1947 Companies Act and no longer satisfies
public opinion. The status quo is therefore not an option. Those who are
unhappy with the APB's proposals should propose an alternative. Without it,
there is a serious danger that the role of the audit will be increasingly
marginalised.
Directors and shareholders need more assurance in an increasingly
competitive and complex business world. If my profession does not provide
it, ultimately others will fill the void. And, unless the profession
demonstrates its vitality, it will be hard to attract talented recruits.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: Best sanction against conflict of interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ERIC C ELSTOB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As a practitioner in an investment management group I was interested by
Lex's worries ('Investment trusts', February 27) about conflicts of interest
between invest-ment trusts and their managers.
I personally keep the bulk of my assets in the shares of the investments
trusts of the group where I work, for the simple reason that I know that the
investment strategy followed is the same as I would follow were my assets
large enough to warrant a discrete port-folio.
Thus as a manager my interests are precisely ad idem with the other
shareholders of the investment trusts.
No regulator could invent a more telling sanction.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Letter: NHS reform and the role of private financing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN FOUREL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Willman's review ('Just what the doctor ordered', March 1) of the
recently published OECD report on the convergence of healthcare systems in
seven countries of the European Community describes clearly the benefits
accruing from operating a mixture of public-sector and private-sector
provision and financing within the framework of a managed market.
Mr Willman's article points out that the British health service is held up
by the OECD report as one of the two services most advanced in their
reforms. It is a pity then that the article did not try to explore the role
that the private healthcare sector might be called upon to play as part of
the new health service now taking shape in Britain.
The issue of private-sector financing in particular could have been
fruitfully examined by doing a comparison with the Dutch service - which the
review describes in some detail (although it is easy to understand how the
topic might need to form the subject of a completely separate article).

FT  05 MAR 93 / Arts: Mozart on the Fringe - Music Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Figaro starts the opera by mapping out his new room: 'TV . . . Video . . .
Hi-fi . . . CD . . .' Leporello keeps the list of Giovanni's conquests on
his pocket computer. Susanna wants to know if Figaro likes the new colour in
her hair. Rosina summons her maid with a bleeper. Ottavio (rhymes with
'gravy-oh') calls Anna 'Kitten' and 'Precious.' Cherubino gets sent to the
Brecon Beacons for a fortnight with the OTC. Don Giovanni (call me Don)
launches the finale with a paean to sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.
This up-to-date modernity is just the top layer of Music Theatre London's
versions of Figaro and Giovanni, which come to London after a triumphant
tour of Germany and Austria. But there are other revelations. The best
comes, I think, in casting both operas with skilled actors, who never place
vocal effect above communicative singing. Put the words first and you hear
how natural Mozart makes the voices sound - how far from high-art plush
exclusivity he was.
The only people who should stay away are canary-fanciers and Ur-text
purists. It is Music Theatre London style to take more cuts than is usual in
the opera house and to replace almost all recitative with speech. Figaro
takes one cut too many - the great second-act trio - but it glides along.
(Though Giovanni sags slightly at two points - the Commendatore's, sorry,
Colonel's, death scene, and the coloratura of Anna's second aria - its
general pace is, if anything, livelier.) The singers bring off the
speech-song alternation with a naturalness that makes Figaro and Giovanni
work like musicals (without the laborious elocution that so often bogs down
the spoken bits in operas like The Magic Flute).
Another joy is the sheer musical and dramatic wit with which these versions
adapt Mozart to the 1990s. It is, of course, a hoot to see Rosina sing her
first aria on an Exercycle, but when her pedalling changes tempo with the
music, and as her singing never falters, the episode actually takes you
deeper into Figaro. The farcically misdelivered kiss and slap in the Act
Four finale work as well as I have seen them, but better yet is the moment
that follows: Cherubino, escaping, bumps into both Figaro and Susanna and
looks fleetingly aghast as he takes in a realm of adult intrigue beyond his
comprehension.
Amid an excellent ensemble, the performers who best exemplify Music Theatre
London style are Liza Sadovy (Susanna and Zerlina) and William Relton
(Ottavio and Basilio). These two are the most natural actor-singers of all,
wonderful in their characterful underplaying; and the way Relton/Basilio
says 'Sounds like a bud in need of nipping, Sir' is among the classic
line-deliveries I have ever heard. Gerard Casey (Don G. and Sir Cecil ie the
Count) is almost as good, though he grievously over-extends every pregnant
pause. Simon Butteriss is both Masetto and Marcellina - yes - which may be
the most remarkable role-swapping since Lynn Seymour switched from Carabosse
to Aurora overnight in 1977; though he pulls faces too much, he is a
marvellously amusing clown.
The Britten/Broadhurst translation is so unfailingly good that I hope to
return just to catch more of its passing felicities. It has only one tiny
bit of translationese ("no tank from the window came down"). The way it
never goes in for smart-alec rhymestering is part of its stylishness. And it
misses only one target. Surely the modern Elvira does not join a convent?
She joins a women's group, or becomes a lesbian, or starts a Ph. D. on the
phallocentricity of Eurocentric culture.
Last week you could also catch a more conventional Don Giovanni - period
togs and all - at the Hackney Empire. The thrill here was hearing how well
this theatre suits Mozart. Sitting way back, I loved both the ease with
which the voices projected through the packed house and the absorption with
which a largely Eastender audience followed most of the show. The company
was Opera Box; its singers offer no new treats to those who know this opera,
and the cast veered away from Fraser Goulding's baton too often. But this
beautiful Matcham Theatre is the best venue for Mozart in London I have
discovered. How appalling to find that it is battling for its continued
existence.
Music Theatre London's season at the Drill Hall, WC1, continues until March

FT  05 MAR 93 / Arts: In search of Robert Campin - Patricia Morison turns
sleuth at the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If conundrums are to your taste, Robert Campin, the latest exhibition in the
National Gallery's Brief Encounters series, will have added zest. The title
could perhaps have been Robert Campin?, subtitled 'A Fireside Mystery'. But
the curators have presented a much simpler, safer story, perhaps wanting
instead to concentrate the public's eye on the indisputable beauty of seven
early Netherlandish panel paintings. Five come from the Gallery's own
collection. The other two images, generously loaned by the Hermitage Museum
in St Petersburg, are the 'Trinity' and 'Virgin and Child in front of a
Fire'.
The St Petersburg paintings, 28cms high, once formed a diptych joined with
hinges so that its owner could fold it like a book. Perhaps the owner who
commissioned it was a merchant, a nobleman, or one of those wealthy and
cultivated Flemish ladies of the early 15th-century who we find bequeathing
paintings in their wills. The National Gallery's 'Wilton Diptych' is an
extremely well-known example of this quite common type of devotional image.
However, its grand subject, the English king Richard II being presented to
the Virgin and Christ-Child at the court of heaven, might seem to put it in
a different world from the St Petersburgpanel.
Yet this Flemish artist's theme is nothing if not grand, even though the
response of some reviewers has implied that this exhibition consists solely
of charmingly intimate, domestic images of the Virgin and Child. What has
the holy infant seen there which has made him move so sharply to the right
and hold his little hands in the air?
In the left-hand Trinity panel, God the Father supports the broken body of
the crucified Christ, whose eyes are closed. Christ faints with agony, yet
evidently he is still conscious because his hand is cupped under the wound
in his side. From that wound there had flowed both blood and water; Christ's
blood, renewed through the sacrament of the Eucharist, is the pledge of
man's redemption.
Carved on God's throne is the familiar pelican slashing her breast to feed
her chicks, as well as a less familiar family of lions. According to the
tradition of the medieval bestiaries, lion-cubs are born dead but after
three days their father breathes on them and they come to life.
To eyes more attuned to Christian doctrine than our own, the diptych would
have represented the Incarnation and Atonement. Mary wears red and blue, and
so does God. The white cloth underneath the Child, whose genitals
representing his full humanity are clearly seen, is a formal parallel to the
loincloth of the crucifixion.
Some say the Virgin holds her right hand up in order to warm it at the fire
before swaddling her baby. But was the artist really evoking such a mundane
process in a painting in which colours, objects, and structure all convey
the symbolic journey towards sacrifice and redemption? Fifteenth-century
images of the Virgin at home always portray her in thoroughly affluent
surroundings, so it seems uncharacteristic to suggest Joseph had been mean
with the heating. To my eye, the gesture is the Mother of God's response - a
little fearful because she is only a woman - to a premonition of the pain
and the glory yet to come.
So let us not sell short this profound and wonderful image by Robert Campin
of Tournai. Not that every scholar has agreed that the diptych is by Campin.
Some have said it is by one of his assistants; Jacques Daret (not
well-known, but certainly worked for Campin) or Rogier Van der Weyden
(immensely admired, and probably a Campin pupil).
'The subject is very obscure', warned the NG's 1968 catalogue of Campin's
putative paintings. He was a famous and admired master of Tournai, and he
was convicted of keeping a mistress in 1432. Very little else, and not one
single painting, is known definitely about Campin. It seems a pity that the
exhibition did not let more obscurity steal forth, like smoke from behind an
arras.
For scholars, half the point of the exhibition is the opportunity it offers
to decide whether the NG's 'Virgin and Child in an Interior' is indeed by
Campin. This panel (half the size and in much better condition than the St
Petersburg picture) was purchased as recently as 1988. It was totally
unknown, but X-ray examination showed it was made from the same piece of
wood as the small 'Portrait of a Man' which some learned authorities -
including the author of the 1968 catalogue - have decided is by Campin.
So is 'Virgin and Child in an Interior' by Campin? A virtually impossible
question for a layperson, although had more of the kernel of 'secure'
paintings been reproduced we might all have felt a little bolder. So try out
another question; which of the paintings in the exhibition present enough
points of similarity to be by the same artist? And while you are about it,
go to the Sainsbury Wing and check out the Rogier Van der Weydens.
An hour of this kind of ferreting is fun. Peering so closely, one
appreciates all the more the realism and attention to detail which is a
hallmark of Campin and the Campinesque. Through the window of 'Virgin and
Child Before a Firescreen' we see the bustle of Tournai, people strolling,
roofers up a ladder.
Campin has been praised for pioneering the street-view, and no doubt his
contemporaries were quite as amazed at his skill. So is it significant that
whoever painted the little panel went for something easier, a view of a
church and a golden cornfield? There are endless questions to ask, and it
may be that a cloud of Campins hover in the air. The art-historians'
business is to chase them and pin them down but thanks to this fascinating
little exhibition, it is a hunt others too can enjoy.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Arts: Millennium reaches the 1920s - Concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month the South Bank takes another musical stride 'Towards the
Millennium', in seven-league boots cobbled by Nicholas Snowman, Simon Rattle
and the late Michael Vyner. As you may remember, their plan for the decade
is to have an annual survey of all the decades of our century, one by one.
It will culminate in 2000 AD with music of the 1990s; this year is the turn
of the 1920s, to which several concerts are devoted.
On Wednesday, Rattle and his City of Birmingham Symphony led off with
middle-period Varese, late-middle Berg (the 1924 Wozzeck Suite) and
Gershwin, and early Shostakovich - all quite disparate. Though it was a
pretty idea to set the Varese Ameriques (1921), his first New York piece,
against An American in Paris (1928), those works passed each other by like
ships in the night; and the precocious Soviet composer and the decadent
Schoenberg pupil were locked into their own musical cultures.
Yes, Mahler was to be a common factor; but Shostakovich began to appreciate
his music only two years after his own First Symphony (1925), at about the
time when he was hearing Wozzeck appreciatively in Leningrad. In Rattle's
hands the Shostakovich First revealed few signs of latent Mahlerianism.
There really is a kinship of pawky irony to be found in the opening
Allegretto - not, however, at Rattle's indifferently hasty tempo, which left
the most characteristic ideas either over-emphatic or just under-pointed.
Far more sympathy was lavished upon the Wozzeck fragments: many poignant,
beautifully wrought details, though the soprano Elise Ross brought only a
concert-singer's careful address to Marie's solos, with no raw drama
incarnated in the voice. Rattle sounded still more engaged by the broad
hit-or-miss expanse of Ameriques, with its full, outre orchestral complement
to knock us over. Then, in properly disarming fashion, Gershwin's American
tourist crashed in, strutted, flirted brashly and won all hearts.
On Monday at the Barbican, the Ukrainian conductor Fedor Glushchenko had
taken the English Chamber Orchestra through a not dissimilar programme, of a
later date but tamer airs. Arvo Part's early 'Cantus in Memory of Benjamin
Britten' unwound, in accordance with its minimalist formula, to moderately
gripping effect; with more deliberate precision, it can seem more magically
suspended and luminous than that. Equally, Tchaikovsky's Mozartiana
transcriptions would have gained by some wry detachment, though the clarinet
and violin cadenzas were vividly projected.
As soloist in Shostakovich's First Cello Concerto (1959), Rafael Wallfisch
was gracefully eloquent - the orchestral accompaniment was too reticent to
prompt him toward any more candid display of feeling. He still managed to do
impressive justice to his grand cadenza-movement. And for the first 'public'
performance of David Matthews' Romanza op. 49, commissioned for the Queen
Mother's 90th birthday and duly performed at Buckingham Palace by
Rostropovich in August 1990, Wallfisch responded perfectly to the manner of
the score. More than any David Matthews' score until his very latest ones,
Romanza has an audibly contemporary basis: not mere nostalgia for the
gestures of between-the-wars British music, but loyal affection for them
refracted from a candid, irrevocable distance. To hear Matthews admit to
being a modern composer, perhaps against his natural bent, was a real
satisfaction. For him like the rest of us, it is too late for naive returns
to past modes; but it is possible to revive them in knowing inverted-commas.

<TEXT>
Since ITV is supposed to be a virtually new channel and the BBC is said to
be fighting for its life, there is a remarkable lack of new thinking in this
evening's television schedules. At 6.00 BBC2 shows a repeat of Stingray, the
puppet series which first appeared in 1965. That is followed at 6.25 by a
repeat of The Man From UNCLE, the spoof special-agent series which began in
the same year. Then, at 7.15, comes a repeat of Doctor Who which started two
years earlier. At 8.00 BBC1 offers a repeat of All Creatures Great And
Small, the series about a vet in the Yorkshire Dales which first appeared in
1977. And at 9.00 ITV weighs in with the first episode in a new series of
Doctor Finlay, the drama about a Scottish country doctor which was launched,
as 'Dr Finlay's Casebook', by the BBC in 1962. The new series picks up the
threads at the end of the Second World War. It sounds like a night for a
long soak in the bath and a good read; Joanna Trollope's 'The Choir' is
classy escapism. You could listen simultaneously to Haydn's Symphony No 90
and Beethoven's 8th in Orchestra Of The Age Of Enlightenment (9.45 Radio 3).

FT  05 MAR 93 / Arts: Crazy for You - London Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I do not want to spoil anyone's pleasure, but large parts of Crazy for You
struck me as absolutely dreadful: practically all the parts indeed that do
not consist of songs and lyrics by George and Ira Gershwin. Since the songs
are relatively few, that means that about two thirds of the show is dross.
There is a supreme irony half way through the first act when Ruthie Henshall
as Polly sings the wonderful 'Someone to Watch Over Me'. Ms Henshall sings
well. Her voice can fill the very large Prince Edward Theatre. Some of the
lines in that song, you may remember, go: 'Won't you tell him please, Put on
some speed, Follow my lead.' How she can utter the words 'put on some speed'
with a straight face is beyond me. For anything resembling speed in Mike
Ockrent's production is conspicuously lacking.
There are other gaps. Crazy for You does not have much of a plot, unless you
count an excursion from New York to Deadrock, Nevada. It is rather thin on
jokes. Only two stand out: the arrival of the founder of the Michelin Guide
in Deadrock and the Deadrock citizen who, asked if he has any views on
drama, suddenly begins a lecture on Chekhov and Stanivslaski.
For the rest, the comedy is at the level of: 'I'm not down here to be
insulted.' 'Oh, where do you usually go?' And 'Madame, if you don't like it
here, I can show you the wide open spaces,' followed by the response, 'I
have no desire to look inside your head'. The book is by Ken Ludwig, and
there is an awful lot of it.
Unless you are addicted to tapdancing, there is not much to be said for the
choreography either. One ensemble song and dance scene relies heavily on men
sliding down small sheets of corrugated tin and waving primitive saws. The
same goes for the physical scenes without musical accompaniment. It is
presented as a great feat that someone can fall downstairs without breaking
a leg or prance about the stage with a chair on his head. This sort of thing
belongs to Blackpool pier, where it might be better done.
I should add that Crazy is also entirely without characterisation. There is
no Annie, no Eliza, no Henry Higgins, no band of brothers and sisters from
the Salvation Army to stir it up. All the characters in Crazy seem equally
flat and forgettable.
That leaves the Gershwin songs and lyrics. No show that contains
'Embraceable You' and 'They Can't Take That Away From Me' as well as
'Someone to Watch Over Me' can be a complete disappointment. When Kirby Ward
as Bobby sings of 'the way you wear your hat . . . the way we danced till
three' and so on, he is quite as effective as Ms Henshall.
Even here, however, there is something odd. Not all the songs are nearly as
good. The rendering of 'Stiff Upper Lip', for example, is enthusiastic, but
as a lyric or a tune it is not much of a piece of work. The biggest failing
even with the best songs is that they are not integral to the show. They
occur almost at random. Quite the best moment comes when two songs follow
each other: Bobby's 'They Can't Take That Away From Me', immediately
succeeded by Polly's short 'But Not For Me'. Such a rapid response happens
only once. Otherwise, this is a ramshackle show punctuated by bad dialogue
and people with silly voices.
The sets are designed by Robert Wagner. One of them - of the Deadrock
theatre - is well above average. For what is meant to be a spectacular show,
the rest are undistinguished. A Rolls Royce appears on stage, chorus girls
clamber out of it, but the standards of (say) the National Theatre when it
comes to showing off have made us expect something more adventurous than
that.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Arts: Donizetti's 'L'assedio di Calais' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Presumably it was the success of this rare Donizetti opera at the Wexford
Festival the year before last which suggested it to the Guildhall School of
Music as a suitable piece for its students. If so, it was a good idea, which
has been well carried through. Audiences and students will have benefited
alike.
In choosing the story of the six burghers of Calais Donizetti was aware that
he was taking on a serious opera which demanded a bold treatment of the
drama. There is no prima donna here to run up and down scales and hit high
notes to provide the focus of attention. In her place L'assedio di Calais is
bravely true to its sober story and asks for the audience's sympathies to go
out to a family and a whole community in suffering.
The central act is one of the composer's finest efforts in serious opera.
One by one the six burghers come forward to sign their names as sacrificial
victims to save their city. No trite cabaletta or bouncy final chorus is
allowed to disturb the sense of the enormity of what they are doing. The
scene builds patiently to a spacious and dignified choral prayer, its sombre
mood well sustained in Stephen Medcalf's production.
There is another advantage in Donizetti's design, too. A music school does
not have to ask one talented student to carry the whole show. Roles of equal
importance can be found for a number of students. This was, for example, the
most taxing role in which we have so far encountered the bass-baritone
Nathan Berg and the imposing depth of his tone was most impressive, even if
some passages stayed high in the voice for longer than he could manage.
He also spoke the Italian text with fine, unforced eloquence; but then the
standard in that department was pretty good all round. Helen Lothian and
Elvia Sanchez, as husband and wife facing separation, made lovingly
expressive music out of their touching scene together. Miss Lothian's mezzo
was steady and strong at either extreme, if not so characterful as yet in
the middle. The soprano was stylish and had the role well within her grasp.
She might have made a good job out of the extra solo that Donizetti added
for his soprano to bring the opera to a sparkling close, if it had been
included. The Guildhall School production, conducted by Clive Timms,
preferred to keep to the original 1836 version of the score. This can at
least claim textual purity and also allowed students of the London
Contemporary Dance School to present the seldom-heard ballet.
The alliance is a worthwhile one (think of the other rare operas on which
the schools could combine). But next time it would be preferable to keep off
tasteless modern costumes and angular brutalist movements, if the rest of
the production is heading in the opposite direction.
Sponsored by the Donizetti Society. Further performances at the Guildhall
School of Music and Drama on March 5, 8 and 10 (071-638 8891)

FT  05 MAR 93 / Management: When the sky falls - Precautions companies can
take against terrorism or disaster
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY and PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How would companies cope if a bomb went off in or near their offices?
Anxious managers have been asking that question this week in the wake of the
blast at Manhattan's World Trade Centre and threats from the IRA that
British commercial and industrial targets are on its list.
For many the answer is not reassuring. John Wyatt, an anti-terrorist expert,
estimates that less than half of the UK's biggest companies have a carefully
thought-out response. He and other security consultants believe businesses
need to give more attention to preventive steps and to contingency plans to
get business started as quickly as possible after an emergency.
Complacency is perhaps more understandable in the US, which has less
experience of urban terrorism than Europe. But several recent events - from
the Wall Street power blackout in August 1990, to security threats during
the 1991-92 Gulf war and last December's storm that flooded parts of
downtown Manhattan - have ensured that security officers and contingency
planners are reasonably well prepared for catastrophic disruptions to their
businesses.
While most companies are reluctant to discuss security, one spokesperson for
a big Wall Street firm said yesterday: 'We are now using the security
programme we introduced at the time of the Gulf war - essentially, it
entails a more restrictive policing of entry and exit from our building.'
The bomb in New York's financial district was worrying to local companies,
because many of them are either banks or securities firms which stand to
lose millions of dollars if their business is seriously disrupted for any
length of time. According to city authorities about Dollars 700m (Pounds
493m) could be lost in disrupted business during the first week after the
bombing alone.
Bill Kelly, the man responsible for contingency planning at JP Morgan, said
the bank has a 'mosaic of plans' that is ready in the event of a
catastrophe. If, for example, the firm's data centre is disrupted, JP Morgan
can either use its data centre in Delaware, or it can turn to emergency
personnel and computer sites provided by private companies such as
Philadelphia-based Sungard or Comdisco of Chicago. If the bank's securities
trading room is put out of action, JP Morgan has arrangements to use a
temporary trading facility in Staten Island operated by another private
company, Exchange Resources.
At Salomon Brothers, the securities firm that occupies the northernmost
building of the World Trade Centre complex, chief administrative officer Tom
Brock says last week's bombing did not catch the firm unprepared: 'We had
planned extensively for this kind of event.' Salomon's offices were not
damaged by the explosion, but the police ordered the power to be cut off for
a few hours as a precautionary measure. Salomon used its own generators and
the firm's business continued throughout the crisis.
If Salomon had been forced to evacuate its building, Brock says the firm has
various sites around the country that could be used, including a special
location near Manhattan that stands by as an emergency trading room.
Some firms, however, were not as well prepared. Cantor Fitzgerald, the
biggest inter-dealer broker in the US bond market, had to scramble over the
weekend to find a home for its hundreds of brokers. Fortunately, Salomon was
able to offer a temporary home to some of them.
Even big UK companies have a security and contingency planning approach
which can be half-baked: most issue passes to visitors, for example, but few
are so careful about collecting them and thus have little idea of who is in
the building.
Similarly, they may have an evacuation plan but may not have considered
whether this is always the best approach. One lesson from last year's
explosion at St Mary Axe in the City of London - which happened after hours
 -was that staff would have been safer in a basement rather than on the
street, where they would have been hit by flying glass.
Companies with closed-circuit television, meanwhile, sometimes render it
useless by not watching it. Others check baggage, but in a predictable way.
Most large UK financial firms have back-up computer tapes stored off the
premises and a 'hot-site' facility to plug the tapes into. But according to
Charles Shaw from Safety Net, a business recovery firm, this is as useful as
'a fire escape going half way down a building' if it is not part part of an
overall business plan.
Companies on both sides of the Atlantic, meanwhile, are turning to
specialist security consultants for help. Eugene Mastrangelo, managing
director of risk assessment at California-based Pinkerton, has been advising
corporate officers they should take three initial steps:
Conduct a 'vulnerability survey' to determine if there are any gaps in the
security protection.
Increase security around premises and upgrade the screening of employees and
visitors entering and leaving buildings.
Re-examine crisis management plans and ask one important question: how would
your company have responded if its offices had been bombed?
According to the experts, companies must be clear about what they can and
cannot protect. In theory everything can be protected, but inevitably there
will be limits to financial and human resources.
A company's response in the first few hours can be crucial. Everyone needs
to know who is responsible for business continuity. A good press manager has
to reassure the outside world that everything is under control.
Companies need to keep up-to-date records of all important customers and
suppliers so that they can be notified at once. They may need separate plans
if the building is closed for hours, days or weeks and have plans for moving
certain staff to other branch offices or alternative accommodation.
It is not just the UK financial sector that is starting to take action. Shaw
says the message is getting through to manufacturing, distribution and
retailing businesses, which now make up almost two thirds of his clients.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology: Shedding new light on cancer - A breakthrough in
treatment on the brink of commercial exploitation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Light-based cancer treatments are on the brink of commercial exploitation -
after 90 years as an experimental procedure.
Photodynamic therapy (known as PDT) uses a drug which is non-toxic until
activated by light. It accumulates in cancer cells and kills them when the
tumour is illuminated.
The first crude attempt to cure skin cancer by PDT was carried out in
Germany in 1903. More systematic experimentation started in the 1970s, using
lasers to activate porphyrins - photosensitive compounds derived chemically
from the haemoglobin molecule that carries oxygen in the blood. Clinical
trials since 1976 have involved several thousand patients with tumours of
the skin, bladder, throat, stomach, bowels and elsewhere.
The normal PDT procedure is to inject the drug into the patient a couple of
days before the laser treatment. This gives the drug time to accumulate in
the cancer cells and clear from the rest of the body.
The tumour is then illuminated for 15 to 30 minutes with a laser emitting
light at the wavelength absorbed most efficiently by the drug. Skin cancer
can be exposed directly to the laser but for internal tumours the light has
to be guided down an optical fibre attached to an endoscope to reach the
cancer.
The power of the laser is too low to harm cells directly. Its purpose is to
activate the drug, which then produces a highly reactive form of oxygen
(free radicals) to kill cells.
Although PDT has apparently cured some people with early cancers and given
relief to those with inoperable late cancers, the results were not
sufficiently spectacular to lead to rapid commercialisation, in view of the
technique's disadvantages: its high cost compared with conventional
chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and the fact that some normal tissues also
become light-sensitive so that patients have to stay indoors for several
weeks after treatment.
This year, however, the first commercial PDT drug, Photofrin, is expected to
receive marketing approval in Canada. It has been developed by Quadra Logic
Technologies of Vancouver and will be sold worldwide in collaboration with
American Cyanamid, the large US chemical company. Quadra Logic expects
Photofrin sales to reach Dollars 95m (Pounds 65.5m) to Dollars 375m within
three years of its launch.
Photofrin is being chased by a group of more selective second-generation PDT
drugs, designed to cause fewer side effects. They will be helped by the
simultaneous development of cheaper lasers.
Quadra Logic is already starting clinical trials of its own follow-up
compound, Benzoporphyrin derivative, on skin cancer. Ciba-Geigy, the giant
Swiss group, has a promising PDT drug, zinc-phthalocyanine, in the final
stages of pre-clinical testing. Other companies active in the field include
Nippon Oil of Japan, Deprenyl of Toronto and PDT Systems of California.
But the second-generation drug furthest advanced in clinical trials is EF9,
a porphyrin derivative developed by Scotia Pharmaceuticals in the UK. It has
been tested in 25 patients at the Royal London Hospital and the universities
of Lausanne and Geneva in Switzerland.
Norman Williams, professor of surgery at the Royal London Hospital, is
pioneering the use of PDT in conjunction with the surgical removal of
tumours. He is carrying out a clinical trial in which patients with
colo-rectal cancer are allocated at random into two groups. Half have
orthodox surgery. The other half are given Photofrin or EF9 and, immediately
after the tumour has been removed, the cavity is illuminated by laser while
the patient is still under general anaesthetic.
The aim is to eradicate the microscopic traces of cancer that are sometimes
left behind when the tumour is removed. These are responsible for the
recurrence of cancer at the same site, which occurs within two years of
surgery in 10 to 15 per cent of the 27,000 cases of colo-rectal cancer
recorded every year in the UK.
Mutaz Abulafi, surgical research fellow at the Royal London, says that after
more than a year of monitoring 58 patients, there have been no recurrences
of cancer among those receiving PDT and three recurrences in the control
group. But it is too soon to draw a clear statistical conclusion about the
effectiveness of PDT.
If controlled clinical trials do prove that PDT is safe and effective, then
Williams would favour its routine use after cancer surgery. Even a modest 10
per cent reduction in the recurrence rate of colo-rectal cancer would
prevent 200 deaths a year in the UK, he points out.
The lasers used today cost tens of thousands of pounds - too much for their
routine installation in general hospitals. But cheaper solid-state lasers
will soon be available. For example PDT Systems and McDonnell Douglas of the
US recently signed an agreement to develop diode lasers for PDT.
Indeed, Williams believes the next generation of PDT drugs will be sensitive
enough to be activated by non-laser light. 'We're in the process of
developing a much cheaper and more robust light source that could be taken
into any operating theatre,' he says. 'It might then be possible to give
this treatment in any hospital anywhere with equipment costing only Pounds
5,000.'
Although cancer is likely to be the main application of PDT, the technique
is applicable to other diseases that give rise to abnormal cells in which
the photosensitive drug can accumulate.
Quadra Logic has started a clinical trial of BPD for psoriasis, a skin
disorder. The company has also carried out animal tests which suggest that
the drug might be able to clear the Aids virus HIV from the blood stream.
This would require a machine somewhat like the one used for kidney dialysis,
in which blood is removed from the patient and exposed to light in a tube
before returning to the body.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Technology: Foxing the car thieves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While the beleaguered car industry does its best to persuade reluctant
consumers to buy new vehicles, a growing number of people has decided there
is a much better way to acquire them - by theft.
In the five years to the end of 1991, vehicle theft in the UK rose by an
alarming 50 per cent. More than 626,000 vehicles were reported stolen in
1991, a rise of nearly a fifth over 1990; 225,000 were not recovered.
Disturbingly, the UK leads the EC in vehicle theft, with owners having a one
in 32 chance of their vehicles being stolen. In the US, it is one in 117.
Manufacturers build in electronic and other safety systems and drivers can
put heavy locks on to their steering wheels whenever they leave their cars.
But a new anti-theft detection system, called Tracker, will shortly be
available in the UK, following its introduction in the US (under the name of
LoJack System) a few years ago.
Tracker is based on a small transponder, which will be sold to vehicle
owners and hidden in cars or trucks by trained installers. When a theft is
reported, a telecommunications system linked to the central computer of
Tracker Network - the newly formed company operating Tracker in the UK -
will send a digitally coded radio signal to the device in the stolen
vehicle.
Police officers in cars fitted with a special direction finder will be able
to detect the tracking signal and find the stolen vehicle. The transponder
can be installed in up to 30 possible locations in a vehicle. Motorists will
be able to buy Tracker units for Pounds 160 (Pounds 220 for heavy trucks),
with an annual fee of Pounds 61.10.
The company says most police forces in Britain have agreed to use the
tracking equipment, with others likely to operate it soon. Several big
insurance companies have said they will offer discounts (as in the US) of
between 7 and 15 per cent on premiums to vehicle owners subscribing to
Tracker.

The decentralisation of companies and flatter management structures -
buzzwords of the 1980s and 1990s - have coincided with the downsizing of
computer systems to produce the latest computer term - groupware.
But while most companies will eventually opt to use information technology
which will support team working, the inhibiting factor today is cultural
rather than technical, according to the Groupware Report'93.
The report, published by Policy Publications, of Brighton, cites numerous
companies that have re-engineered their business structures using groupware
and have cut costs in the process. The report costs Pounds 195. Policy

Headaches, dizziness and allergic reactions can all be caused by the dust,
gases and microbes in every office. As the number of ozone-emitting
photocopiers and printers increases, so moves to newer offices compound the
problem by cutting off natural ventilation such as draughts.
To detect poor air quality Winton Environmental Services, of Worcester Park,
Surrey, has developed a monitor which continuously checks, during office
hours, whether the air is likely to cause illnesses. The Monitair 393 checks
for bacteria, fungi, carbon dioxide and formaldehyde - often emitted from
soft furnishings - as well as dust and ozone. The samples are removed every
three weeks and tested. A summary of the results and recommendations are
then given to the company. Winton Environmental Services: UK, 081 337 0731.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Management: The myth of the bloated head office
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT OF increasing its profits and dividend, there is one sure way for a
company to please its shareholders and the vast majority of its managers: to
cut the size and cost of its head office, or 'corporate centre'. But as the
past month has shown, it is also the best way to sow confusion - and
possibly something worse.
That HQ-cutting has become such a totem of good management is the result of
a number of long- and short-term pressures. They include:
The trend towards flatter, simpler, faster-moving and more outward-looking
organisations, which delegate much more decision-making to the front line.
The 'shareholder value' movement of the past decade, which drew alarmed
attention to the fact that a multinational's corporate centre can easily
cost upwards of Pounds 200m a year.
The realisation that many activities, from catering to data processing,
insurance, accounting and tax, can be contracted-out to specialist
consultancies.
The fashion for small HQs which was set by predatory UK conglomerates such
as GEC, Hanson and BTR.
All these have been reinforced over the past 18 months by a fifth pressure:
the very straitened financial circumstances in which many large companies
have found themselves.
All well and good, you may say: those remote, unproductive, paper-pushing HQ
staff have had it so cushy for so long that they deserve every cut they get.
But this machismo has reached such a pitch that it risks putting pressure on
companies to ignore what ought to be the foundation of every head office
redesign: a cool assessment of the nature of the company's various
businesses and the best way in which the corporate centre can add value to
them.
This should almost never mean increasing the size of an HQ, but nor does it
mean that every company's should be slashed.
Take three announcements of cuts over the past month, including two within
the past week - first from buoyant Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch packaged goods
group and then from two hard-pressed chemicals combines, Britain's ICI and
America's Dow. Not only did each move cause confusion, but together they
underline some of the many questions surrounding the right role of head
office in different circumstances.
Four weeks ago Unilever, with annual revenues of Pounds 25bn, announced it
was trimming its HQ, which is split between London and Rotterdam, by 120
people to 1,075. This was widely criticised for being too mild because of
lack of financial pressure.
Last Friday ICI, with revenues about half as large, won wide acclaim by
saying that within two years the HQs of the two companies into which it is
demerging itself, Zeneca and new-ICI, would together employ barely half its
current head office staff of 450. On Monday Dow, with roughly the same
revenues as ICI, declared a cut of only about 250 in its own current
complement of no less than 4,000.
So which of the three will have the most productive HQ? Zeneca and ICI, it
would seem, with Unilever trailing a fair way behind and Dow bringing up the
rear.
Not necessarily. For the three define their corporate centres in such
different ways that comparisons are well-nigh impossible without the
detailed activity-by-activity analysis for which consultants charge
handsomely. Even then, packaged goods and chemicals are so different as to
render much of this analysis subjective.
If ICI were not so intent on showing how lean it has already become, it
could re-express its current total of 450 as either 650 - including 'central
services' working in London - or 870, which adds in pensions experts,
patents people and other staff outside the capital. Some of these staff
spend part of their time supporting ICI's various 'businesses', or
divisions. But none of these figures includes divisional managers
themselves, who at ICI are rightly counted separately.
Not so at Dow - well, not entirely. As with other US companies, its
headquarters in Michigan seems so vast because it includes not just many of
the sort of service staff whom ICI counts separately, but also quite a
number of divisional managers. Moreover, the Dow figure contains not only
those with corporate roles, but also staff working for the company's North
American regional HQ. Many people work for both HQs, so separate numbers are
impossible to determine.
On a host of grounds, not least those of staff motivation and clear cost
control, ICI-like transparency is clearly preferable. But it has been far
from the rule among multinationals, even in Europe.
Hence some of the Unilever changes. In addition to the cut of 120 (all in
London), they also involve a clear separation from the corporate centre of
260 staff who work for the group's operating companies, plus 330 who are
engaged in either British or Dutch national management.
Then there is the dreaded subject of synergy. One of the reasons why
Unilever may need a larger head office than either Dow or ICI, pro-rata for
its size, is that its businesses have more in common with each other. This
inter-dependence tends to create many more issues in which the corporate
centre needs to get involved.
If one also takes into account the different degrees to which the three
companies sub-contract various activities, or have begun to join the trend
towards dispersing HQ tasks around product divisions, the comparisons become
fuzzier still.
The only solution is to subject each corporate centre to a microscope and to
judge on real merit. Appearances are almost always deceptive.

FT  05 MAR 93 / The Property Market: Weighed down with debtors - Banks have
no easy remedy for bad lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Pounds 780m provisions against UK property and construction losses that
Barclays announced yesterday is a reminder, if one were needed, of the scale
of the banks' property lending problems.
As the largest lender to UK property, Barclays has suffered the severest
damage from bad property loans. But with a total of Pounds 38bn of
outstanding loans to the UK property sector, few banks have escaped heavy
write-downs.
The question of how the banking industry deals with property companies that
cannot repay their debts is of paramount importance to the property
industry.
In the past year, there have been many high profile receiverships or
administrations, such as Rosehaugh, Mountleigh and Canary Wharf. But the
failures are eclipsed by the much larger number of companies that banks are
attempting to keep afloat.
Banks have been increasingly reluctant to put companies into receivership,
the exceptions usually being cases where the banks have lost patience with
the management. The reluctance partly stems from a fear that property in
receivership plummets in value. However a company that needs cash to stay
afloat may sell more cheaply than a receiver.
Faith in the powers of receivers has been dwindling. 'Receivership is only
helpful to the accountants. It does not maximise values,' says Mr Richard
Millward of Kleinwort Benson's asset recovery unit, which is marketing its
services to other banks with too few staff to cope with problem loans.
Receivers are also accused of being slow and expensive and of knowing little
about property.
Mr Nigel Hamilton of Ernst &amp; Young defends his profession. 'If there is no
market for property then no insolvency procedure will do anything for it,'
he says.
Receivers can improve prospects, he says. He cites Butlers Wharf, Sir
Terence Conran's mixed development on the banks of the Thames which went
into receivership in 1990, as an example of what can be done. 'When we came
here, there was a feeling of dereliction,' he says.
In the past two years, Ernst &amp; Young has sold most of the residential
apartments in the Cardamon Buildings and has sold the freehold of the
Butlers Wharf buildings to a Danish pension fund for more than Pounds 20m.
Even the delays in taking decisions are not the fault of receivers, says
Hamilton. The problems stem from getting a large banking syndicate of maybe
20 or 30 banks to take decisions.
The presence of large banking syndicates is one reason why this property
recession is harder to deal with than that of the 1970s. But the main reason
is the scale of the problem. The total debt to the property industry is, in
real terms, three times that of 1974. Moreover, the work-out will not be
aided by the surge in inflation which assisted during the 1970s or by
investment from the institutions, which used to be enthusiastic buyers of
property.
This time, demand for property is weak. The banks' loans to property
companies fell by 4.2 per cent last year, but the rate of decline slowed by
the end of the year, reflecting the limited appetite for property from
investors and the capital markets.
The absence of any obvious answers to the banks' problems has prompted calls
for innovation.
Debt-for-equity swaps, debt trading and securitisation are all under
consideration.
The most common of these is debt-for-equity swaps, whereby a bank takes an
equity stake in a company that cannot repay its debt. The principle was
taken to its logical conclusion when Barclays took on the beneficial
ownership of Imry at the end of last year (on which it yesterday took a
Pounds 240m provision) and when Citibank took over Randsworth Trust earlier
this week.
These deals were unusual because the banks were the sole lenders to the
companies; and they are unlikely to herald a trend, since UK banks are
unwilling to take on the responsibility and potential liabilities of owning
companies.
Secondary trading of debt evolved in connection with the third world. The
trading of debt in companies such as Brent Walker, Mountleigh and Heron is
considered by lenders which may prefer a short-term loss to being locked in
for several years.
The Bank of England has expressed disquiet. 'In the majority of workout
situations, debt sales will impede progress,' said Mr Pen Kent, an associate
director of the Bank of England, last year. 'It is not in keeping with
London Approach, namely that banks should be supportive of a company which
has announced that it is in financial difficulty.'
Securitisation is a way of increasing the property market's liquidity by
repackaging property so that it appeals to the capital markets. It has been
used several times in the UK, most recently when Rosehaugh Stanhope
Developments raised Pounds 100m in the US commercial paper market to
refinance a building in its Broadgate office complex in the City of London.
Securitisation is likely to be feasible only with well-let properties, which
are the kind of buildings that are most likely to find buyers anyway.
None of these innovations is a panacea. There will be no easy solutions to
the problems that excessive property lending has brought the banks.

FT  05 MAR 93 / People: North West Water flows into Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
When Swedish-born Eva Wisemark walked into the office of North West Water's
chief executive Bob Thian to be greeted in Danish, she was immediately
impressed. 'I have great respect for anyone with English as their mother
tongue who bothers to learn a Scandinavian language.'
Presumably Thian was also impressed because he has now hired Wisemark, whose
own linguistic skills are considerable and who has globe-trotted vigorously
in a varied career, as the water company's European project director, a new
position reporting to Alan Dean, group business development director.
With a mechanical engineering degree under her belt, her first job was
selling gas turbines and steam generators for GEC in Sweden. She has worked
with the Austrian State Power Board in Vienna, MIAG in Braunschweig,
Germany, and John Brown Engineering in Portsmouth. For the past 13 years she
was based in the US, latterly as director of external business development
in the engineered materials sector of Allied-Signal.
There she did a good deal of work in former eastern European countries,
which in turn is part of her new beat. North West Water has a highly
ambitious Pounds 5bn investment programme this decade, with 8,000 projects
under way at any one time.
The new opening also offers her the chance to quit commuting across the
Atlantic to see her husband who moved back to Cheshire two years ago.
While it has pursued contracts in locations from Thailand to Australia to
Indonesia as opportunities presented themselves, North West has hitherto had
almost no presence in Europe - save a German operation belonging to Wallace
&amp; Tiernan of the US which has been part of the group since 1991.
Wisemark has a team of a dozen east European engineers who are working for
her to produce a range of feasibility studies on possible North West Water
projects in their respective countries.
She is also looking within the EC to decide how and where the UK utility can
best compete.

FT  05 MAR 93 / People: Predator turned quarry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Stuart Mitchell, managing director of the UK arm of New Zealand's Brierley
Investments, has decided to give up the life of a corporate predator and
become a full-time executive of one of his quarries. The 37-year-old New
Zealand accountant has been appointed corporate development director of
Alvis, the engineering group.
Brierley, an investment group which specialises in taking strategic stakes
in companies, had acquired a reputation for spotting under-valued stock
market situations. Over the last few years it has held substantial stakes in
companies such as Ultramar, Ocean Transport, Union Discount, William Low and
Budgens. One of its more celebrated ventures was to try and persuade Vickers
shareholders to support the demerger of its Rolls Royce car business before
the onset of the recession.
However, Brierley's UK stock market activities have been curtailed following
its Pounds 644m takeover of Britain's Mount Charlotte hotel chain which left
it heavily indebted. 'Over the last twelve months we have been very quiet'
says Mitchell, who admits that his firm does not have a lot of cash for
further investments.
Brierley has a 29.9 per cent stake in Alvis and it is its second biggest UK
investment. Mitchell has been a non-executive director of Alvis for two
years and says that he knows the people and the problems at Alvis, which
reported a small net loss last year and cut its dividend. Alvis says that
Mitchell will be responsible for the acquisition and disposal of Alvis
businesses as the group restructures.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The appointment of Sir Ron Dearing as chairman of the new School Curriculum
and Assessment Authority has initiated a reshuffle at the top of three
powerful education quangos. Sir Ron, who was chairman of the Post Office
Corporation between 1981 and 1987, is currently chairman of the Higher
Education Funding Council for England.
The Schools Authority will be responsible from October for the national
curriculum in England and Wales and for the compulsory tests administered to
all schoolchildren at 7, 11, 14 and 16.
It replaces the National Curriculum Council (NCC) and the School
Examinations and Assessment Council (SEAC), whose chairmen, David Pascall
and Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach respectively, will stand down on April 19
so that Sir Ron can chair both through the transition.
This will be the second time Dearing has performed such a role: he was
chairman of both the Universities Funding Council and the Polytechnics and
Colleges Funding Council when they merged to form the Higher Education
Funding Council.
The new chairman of the Higher Education Funding Council for England is to
be Brandon Gough, chairman of Coopers &amp; Lybrand. A chartered accountant,
Gough became chairman of the accountancy firm at the unusually young age of
45, and saw it through the merger with Deloitte's.
He is currently chairman of the Doctors' and Dentists' Pay Review Body and a
member of the Financial Reporting Council.
One more vacancy remains to be filled in the education world: a chairman for
the new Funding Agency for Schools, set up to dispense funds to opted-out
schools, is to be announced shortly.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Discharging the honourables - A
lack of enthusiasm about the planned reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRIN AND bear it was the order of the day yesterday in officers' messes as
Mr John Major announced his reform of the honours system.
It was not a revolt over the effect of the changes on military decorations,
but there was a distinct lack of enthusiasm among senior ranks of the armed
forces about the way Mr Major's vision of a classless and meritocratic
society was being applied.
'Are we actually achieving any great improvement?' mused one brigadier. But
he added: 'I don't think anyone would die in a ditch over the changes.' The
armed services have no wish to be depicted as diehard opponents of change.
But by their nature they are hierarchical, and few felt strongly that the
principle of different awards for different ranks was misplaced or wrong.
'There was never a great discussion about it,' another long-serving officer
said.
The hardest change to swallow is the loss of automatic knighthoods for those
reaching 'three-star' level - lieutenant general, vice-admiral or air
marshal.
'They don't get much else, poor things,' said a retired major general, whose
army career ended one rank short of automatic knighthood.
A former senior army commander commented: 'If he were an American you would
give him a huge increase in salary, a thick carpet on the floor and a couple
of extra secretaries.'
So few make it to the top of their services nowadays that they deserved
their knighthoods, he said. The number of officers on the active list in
three-star posts and above - now about 50 - is due to shrink by a quarter or
more in the cuts in the armed forces.
Abolition of the two-tier system of gallantry awards, dating from the first
world war, was widely seen as inevitable. Until now only officers could win
the Distinguished Service Order. The equivalent for other ranks has been the
Distinguished Conduct Medal in the army or Conspicuous Gallantry Medal in
the navy or RAF.
One step lower, the Military Cross, Distinguished Service Cross or
Distinguished Flying Cross were for officers, while others had 'medals'
instead of 'crosses' pinned on them. The only decoration available to all
ranks, dating back to the Crimean war, was the top bravery award, the
Victoria Cross.
The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire, with its separate military
division, was also a first world war invention. Ranks below warrant officer,
excluded from any of the classes of the order, earned British Empire Medals
instead, for 'meritorious service'. They will now share the MBE awards with
majors and squadron leaders - but not with higher ranks, who rate OBEs or
CBEs.
If the military is slightly aggrieved by the reform it is because it sets
store by its special relationship with the Crown. After all, even the titles
used for civilian honours - 'Commander', 'Officer', 'Order', 'Empire' - bear
distinctly military overtones. And who should become a knight if not a
cavalry officer?
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: PM forced to defend Thatcher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR was yesterday forced into an embarrassing public defence of
Lady Thatcher's economic management during the 1980s as opposition leaders
accused him of seeking to blame her for the recession.
His disavowal of reports that he now regarded the economic downturn and the
contraction of the country's manufacturing base as the fault of his
predecessor followed renewed efforts by Treasury ministers to talk up the
prospects for recovery.
But Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, damped hopes of another cut in
interest rates to coincide with the Budget. In their last appearance in the
Commons before the March 16 Budget Treasury ministers also refused to rule
out the possibility of increasing taxation by extending VAT to zero-rated
items such as domestic fuel, food and newspapers.
Looking distinctly uncomfortable, Mr Major told MPs he had been
misrepresented in a newspaper interview in which he appeared to suggest Lady
Thatcher had underestimated the importance of manufacturing industry.
In the face of a sharp attack on his remarks by Mr John Smith, the Labour
leader, Mr Major added that a full transcript of his remarks showed that he
had not disowned responsibility for interest rates of 14 per cent he
'inherited' when he became prime minister in 1990.
Mr Smith taunted Mr Major at Commons question time over the comments made in
an interview in The Independent newspaper. 'Having run out of excuses for
the abject failure of your government's economic policies, you are now
trying to pin the blame on your predecessor in whose government you were
responsible for economic policy,' the Labour leader said.
Earlier, Ms Helen Jackson, Labour MP for Sheffield Hillsborough recalled Mr
Major saying in 1989 that he would take his 'own share of responsibility'
and not seek to heap it on his predecessors.
Mr Major retorted: 'Lady Thatcher did more to help British industry than the
Labour party has ever done.'
He added: 'As far as interest rates are concerned, I was referring to the
legacy of the recession that we are curing and that has now hit every other
nation in Europe.'
During earlier exchanges, Mr Lamont underlined again his recent caution
about the prospects for further reductions in interest rates, emphasising
the importance of holding down inflation.
The chancellor also pointed out that the Treasury's 'postbag' showed
individuals evenly divided between borrowers who wanted still lower rates
and savers who wanted a higher return on their deposits.
Labour is to use its supply day next Tuesday for a debate on domestic
manufacturing industry. Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry secretary,
said yesterday that the opposition would use the debate to show how 'the
rate of decline in manufacturing has speeded up since John Major became
prime minister'.

LABOUR was defeated in a by-election for Lambeth council last night, the
first since reports emerged of allegations of corruption in the south London
borough. Liberal Democrat Mr Ray Woolford won a seat in Angell Ward,
Brixton.
The area was the only one in the borough to have consistently returned
Labour since council reorganisation in 1964. Labour now has 27 council seats
to 19 Tories, seven Liberal Democrats and 10 former Labour members suspended
by the party. One seat is vacant.

MR JOHN MAJOR'S standing as prime minister continues to slump, according to
a Gallup poll published today in the Daily Telegraph.
Only 27.9 per cent are satisfied with his performance - a fall of nearly
half since the general election 11 months ago. Nearly a third of voters,
31.6 per cent, now think Labour leader Mr John Smith would make the best
prime minister.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Close vote on asylum changes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government narrowly avoided a fresh defeat last night on its
controversial attempt to change asylum and immigration laws.
Voting was 123 to 108 to reject an amendment to the Asylum and Immigration
Appeals Bill which would have undermined the tougher rules affecting
visitors, short-term and prospective students and their dependants.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Minister warns on drug charges
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HEALTH MINISTER Dr Brian Mawhinney said last night that he would have no
hesitation in increasing prescription charges again - even after the 13 per
cent increase announced this week to Pounds 4.25.
He told the BBC1's Question Time that the government - like Labour before it
 -believed that those who could make a contribution to the cost of their
drugs should do so.
Dr Mawhinney said there was no commitment by any government or political
party never to increase or decrease anything by more than the rate of
inflation.
Meanwhile, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday rejected
a call from the cross-party Commons health committee for the government to
support an EC ban on tobacco advertising.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row fear on Scots reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET ministers yesterday approved a limited package of constitutional
reforms for Scotland but are likely to face a barrage of opposition next
Tuesday when the details are announced.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, faces protest for not giving locally
elected representatives more say in Scottish government.
There is also concern among opposition MPs over the proposed moving of civil
service jobs from London to Scotland.
One option the prime minister and his colleagues were discussing was that
the Scottish Grand Committee - comprising all 72 Scottish MPs but augmented
by non-Scottish Tories to reflect the government's Commons majority - may be
given a wider remit than its at present role, which is entirely subservient
to government policy.
Yesterday's discussion was the culmination of a promise given by the prime
minister during last year's general election in the face of the Scottish
National party's demand for total separation and Labour's plans for new
regional assemblies, including a powerful Scottish parliament.
Mr Major agreed to look at various options. But he has made clear he is an
unflinching supporter of the union between Scotland and the rest of the
United Kingdom and would not contemplate any action that put it at risk.
The Labour party yesterday ordered a shake-up of its operations in the
political heartland of party leader Mr John Smith.
A Labour inquiry into the running of local parties in the Monklands area of
Lanarkshire said the district council had left itself 'open to criticism' by
the way staff were appointed.
Mr Smith is MP for Monklands East and Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish
secretary, represents Monklands West.
The inquiry team has also rewritten the standing orders of the local parties
in what appears to be a dismantling of an old-style political machine.
However the inquiry report - ordered by Labour's Scottish executive last
September - was muted in its criticism and insisted the changes were simply
an updating of antiquated local procedures.
The report said that 'those who suggest that improper actions have taken
place should put those charges in the hands of the appropriate authorities
or desist from making the allegations'.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MPs endorse pub rents campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CROSS-PARTY group of MPs has given its backing to a campaign by licensees
of pubs owned by Inntrepreneur Estates, protesting at the 'excessive' rents
charged on long-term leases by the Grand Metropolitan/Courage joint venture
company.
The MPs - representing all three of the main political parties - have called
on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, to initiate an urgent
Office of Fair Trading inquiry into the subject.
Using a parliamentary early day motion, they said they noted 'with grave
concern' widespread evidence of 'unrealistic changes in tenancy agreements
and rents' imposed on landlords by Inntrepreneur.
Ten days ago, licensees of Inntrepreneur pubs, some of whom have acquired
GrandMet shares, picketed the food and drinks group's annual meeting to
publicise their claims.
Inntrepreneur, established two years ago in the Pounds 2.36bn
pub-for-breweries deal between GrandMet and Courage, owns about 6,850 pubs.
The estate is managed by GrandMet and most of its beer is supplied by
Courage.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Portillo moves on EC aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, yesterday appeared to
clear the way for Britain's regions to receive up to Pounds 1bn in aid from
the European Community.
He told the Commons that the Treasury was ready to match the regional
development funds provided from Brussels, which is a condition under EC law
for the funds being distributed.
Mr Portillo said he had no reason to believe that there would be any
difficulty in ensuring 'public expenditure cover' for the regional
development funds allocated to Britain. He envisaged that Sir John Kerr,
Britain's permanent representative in Brussels, would be writing to Mr Bruce
Millan, regional policy commissioner, 'in the near future'.
A senior EC regional policy official last night welcomed the statement but
said the Commission would require 'a clear and precise answer' to its
concern that the government has not been matching the EC funds, in spite of
previous commitments to do so.
'With the experience we've had in the past, we can not prejudge. We need to
see where the beef is,' the official said.
Mr David Hanson (Lab, Delyn) protested at question time that the government
had been responsible for delaying EC grants worth millions of pounds which
were badly needed for investment in training and in industry.
Mr Millan warned last week that it risked losing 'large' sums of community
aid for depressed regions unless it conformed to rules obliging member
states to match EC funds.
He wrote to the government seeking urgent talks following complaints from
local authorities in the nine UK regions eligible for regional aid grants.
Senior commission officials confirmed that up to Pounds 1bn earmarked for
the UK had still to be disbursed - and could be lost if not committed to
regional development schemes by the end of the current year.
'If they (the British government) don't want to lose the money they will
have to do something about it,' Mr Millan said, though he added that:
'Nobody is suggesting that they're going to lose everything.'
The department of trade and industry sought to play down the row saying that
funds would be matched - although final details have still to be agreed.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Major's maverick saviour - David
Owen profiles deputy Speaker Michael Morris, who yesterday helped the
Maastricht bill clear a difficult hurdle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AIR of relief on the government front bench was genuine. After all, the
man responsible for the ruling which got Mr John Major and ministers off the
hook on Maastricht was never the sort of MP on whom successive Tory
governments could rely for unquestioning loyalty - even before he was made a
deputy speaker.
In his 19 years in the Commons Mr Michael Wolfgang Laurence Morris has
quietly built up a reputation for independent-mindedness on issues close to
his heart, while managing until recently to keep out of the limelight.
Perhaps his best-known act of rebellion during a long backbench career was
in twice opposing the Moore-Clarke National Health Service reforms in late
1989 (his wife is a general practitioner). But his dissent was not confined
to a single issue. A study of divisions in the 1989-90 parliamentary session
put him ninth equal on the list of Tory rebels.
The key role in Maastricht proceedings he has been given by virtue of his
chairmanship of the ways and means committee has finally forced him out of
Westminster's shadows. His trademark bow-tie is fast becoming as well-known
as Mr Tristan Garel-Jones's cape or Mr Kenneth Clarke's Hush Puppies.
Few would claim that his independence has been compromised, however. 'I
think he has been tough, but he has been tough on all sides,' says Mr Jim
Cran, one of the Tory Euro-sceptic leaders, speaking before yesterday's
ruling. Mr George Robertson, Labour's European affairs spokesman, said: 'He
has now found his moment and is doing superbly well.'
By common consent the MP for Northampton South has handled the sometimes
tortuous series of Maastricht debates with wit, skill and imperturbable
authority.
His initiative in meeting MPs with a particular interest in Maastricht
before the beginning of the committee stage to establish ground-rules and
assure them of his good faith, is seen as typical of his high level of
preparation. Mr Morris is also credited with the decision to divide the
copious amendments to the tiny three-clause bill into easily manageable
groups to help ensure all subjects were adequately debated.
Before yesterday's ruling his stock had risen particularly high among
opposition and Euro-sceptic MPs after he consented last month to allow a
debate on the government's embarrassing u-turn over its legal advice.
But a 13-year stretch on the powerful cross-party public accounts committee
of MPs has evidently helped to instil in him an aversion to humbug. He has
been prepared to put protagonists on both sides of the Maastricht divide
firmly in their place when his patience has been taxed.
A marketing specialist, Mr Morris began his professional career with Reckitt
&amp; Colman and is a past leader of Islington council. His south Midlands seat
 -now ultra-safe - was marginal when he won it.
His sole taste of government came in a two-year stint as parliamentary
private secretary in the Northern Ireland Office more than a decade ago. He
subsequently underlined his independence in 1982 by opposing the Northern
Ireland Assembly Bill to set up a locally elected forum.
A former captain of the parliamentary golf club and landowner who lists 250
acres of woodland in the register of members' interests, he is probably the
only MP to include budgies in his Who's Who entry for recreations.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour decision on water welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATER COMPANIES yes-terday welcomed confirmation that the Labour party has
'reluctantly' turned its back on renationalisation of the industry, in the
words of Mr Chris Smith, shadow environment spokesman.
'If I had to choose between buying back Thames Water and building 30
hospitals I would build 30 hospitals,' he told the industry journal of the
Water Services Association, which represents the 10 water and sewerage
companies quoted on the stock market. However, Labour still opposes
privatisation of Scottish water, set to be one of this year's political
battlegrounds.
Yesterday Mr Smith said the statement did not represent a U-turn as the
party manifesto in the general election last April had accepted private
ownership of the industry.
'If you ask me is (government ownership) a long term aim I would say yes but
we recognise there is no short term prospect that a government could afford
it'.
He argued that the manifesto, which said that companies should be brought
back under public control, referred to the need for greater regulation.
'The one good thing that came out of the water privatisation (in December
1989) was the establishment of the National Rivers Authority as an
independent regulator, but more is needed to protect the customers,' he
said.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: DTI concerned over USM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry is throwing its weight behind efforts
to ensure that the planned closure of the Unlisted Securities Market does
not leave London without a market for smaller stocks.
Baroness Denton, the minister responsible for small businesses, is
understood to be planning to meet City experts to discuss her concern at the
impact of the USM's closure.
While recognising that the recession has hit the USM hard, she is thought to
believe a longer-term view of the market's value should be taken.
She is understood to sympathise with fears that the lack of a junior market
could force owners of small companies to sell out entirely to realise funds
tied up in the businesses. But no government money is thought to be
available to ensure a market for smaller companies survives.
The Stock Exchange, which intends to open an 'identifiable smaller companies
sector' on the Official List, has recommended shutting the USM at the end of
1995. But a final decision is not due until later this month.
It has pledged to take into account comments received before today. If the
closure goes ahead, no new issues will be allowed on the USM after June 30.
The government's position on the closure is complicated by last year's
transfer of responsibility for regulating financial markets and non-bank
financial services to the Treasury from the department of trade and
industry.
In the Treasury's view, it is up to the Stock Exchange to decide whether or
not it wants to operate a second market. Officials emphasised, however, that
anyone meeting regulatory requirements can operate such a market if the
Stock Exchange does shut the USM.
Since the Stock Exchange authorities signalled the demise of the USM last
December, a groundswell of opinion in favour of keeping a junior market has
developed. The City Group for Smaller Companies is urging the exchange to
delay closure pending proposals for an alternative market with separate
governance.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Councils urged to maintain arts cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ARTS Council yesterday expressed its concern about cuts in local
authority arts spending.
Local authorities are the main paymasters of the arts in England and Wales,
spending more than Pounds 300m a year, compared with the government's Arts
Council budget of Pounds 225m. But rate-capping and other financial
pressures have persuaded many local authorities to cut their arts budgets
for 1993-94.
Mr Anthony Everitt, secretary-general of the Arts Council, has written to
local authorities urging them to maintain their arts spending.
The Theatre Foundry, a touring arts organisation in Walsall, West Midlands,
has lost its entire local authority revenue of Pounds 75,000 and the nearby
New Vic Theatre in Stoke has had its grant from Staffordshire County Council
cut 40 per cent.
The Northern Ballet has lost Pounds 57,000, reducing its grant to Pounds
200,000, and Watermans Arts Centre in Brentford, west London, has suffered a
15 per cent reduction in grant.
The Arts Council, which received an increase of only 2 per cent in its grant
for 1993-94, can offer no financial help. It is pressing the Department of
National Heritage to make it a statutory requirement for local authorities
to support the arts.

FT  05 MAR 93 / VW aims to double its market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Volkswagen group, the largest European carmaker, is developing plans to
more than double the share of the VW and Audi makes in the UK market for new
cars by the late 1990s.
VW acquired VAG United Kingdom, the distributor of Volkswagen and Audi
vehicles in Britain, from Lonrho in December for Pounds 124m.
Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman
of the VW volume car division, outlined aggressive plans for the development
of the two makes in the UK, which has been one of the German carmaker's
weaker markets in Europe.
He said that the VW brand would be aiming to gain a share of 7 per cent to 9
per cent by 1996-97, compared with a share last year of only 4.1 per cent.
The Audi make would aim for 4 per cent to 5 per cent of UK new car sales
compared with only 1.2 per cent in 1992.
Volkswagen faces a predicted sharp fall in sales in Germany, its most
important market, in the next two years and the UK is one of the few markets
expected to grow this year, albeit from a very low level.
Competition is set to intensify in the UK market as the three Japanese
carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda, build up production in Britain.
Volkswagen's ambitions will pose a serious challenge to the established UK
market leaders Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover.
Mr Goeudevert said: 'There is no reason why we should not reach in the UK
the average level we have in the rest of Europe.'
Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of west European
new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent in the UK.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Reported rise in new car sales prompts doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW CAR registrations rose by 16 per cent last month, according to figures
released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, possibly
indicating recovery in the market.
Ford, the UK market leader, said there had been a pronounced rise in the
number of private buyers entering the market - a development likely to be
strongly welcomed by a government anxious to see consumer confidence
restored.
But suspicions surround the true strength of the recovery, and the extent to
which the statistics might be inflated by manufacturers organising
market-boosting tactics, such as the registering of cars for which there are
no real buyers.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, said last month
that January's figures were 'inflated and erroneous', and reflected attempts
by some manufacturers to boost their market shares and hence consumer
confidence in their products.
The doubts were strengthened by statistics released yesterday showing new
commercial vehicle registrations down by 7.5 per cent last month.
The society expressed particular concern that the poor state of continental
European markets means that the UK is the only major EC country where sales
are improving.
The society said: 'A strong build-up in domestic sales is essential if the
UK industry is to compensate for sales which are bound to be lost overseas,'
Its concern is based on some of the sharpest recorded falls seen in key
Continental markets: German sales fell 27.6 per cent on a year-on-year basis
in January; French sales by nearly 37 per cent and Spanish sales by nearly
53 per cent.
Yesterday's statistics show registrations of new cars last month at 126,984,
up 16.06 per cent from 109,414 in the same month last year.
Sales in February last year were at their lowest February level since 1976,
however, because buyers delayed spending decisions in the hope that the 10
per cent special car tax - now abolished - would be reduced in the following
month's Budget.
For the first two months of this year registrations were up 10.96 per cent,
to 291,923 from 263,096. The market has now risen for five consecutive
months, and in nine of the last 11 months.
The percentage of imports, although down marginally in February to 53.78 per
cent (from 54 per cent), has risen in the year to date to 54.41 per cent
(from 53.4 per cent).
Mr David Gent, director-general of the Retail Motor Industry Federation,
representing 7,500 dealers, warned last night: 'It is critically important
that the government does not receive a false signal from these figures. The
only credible strategy for the Budget is one of no significant change to any
area of taxation.'
The sharpest jumps in registrations last month were achieved by Ford, up
34.75 per cent, Fiat group, up 48 per cent and Peugeot and Renault, up 27.74
per cent and 33 per cent respectively.

FT  05 MAR 93 / EC to order BAe repayment: Rover 'sweeteners' and interest
could amount to more than Pounds 60m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<TEXT>
THE European Commission will next week order British Aerospace to repay
Pounds 44.4m it received in 1988 from the government to 'sweeten' its
purchase of Rover, the car manufacturer.
BAe will also have to repay interest which has accrued since 1990, when the
commission ruled that the sweeteners amounted to illegal state aid. That
ruling was overturned in the European Court of Justice a year ago on a
technicality.
EC officials confirmed yesterday that a recommendation by Mr Karel Van
Miert, the competition commissioner, was on the agenda of next week's
commission meeting and should be approved without further discussion by the
17 commissioners.
Mr Van Miert's proposal does not include a figure for interest charges -
some commissioners had urged that interest be calculated from the date of
the 1988 sale. The charges will be calculated according to UK rules
governing recovery of state aid and some estimates have put the total
repayment at more than Pounds 60m.
The decision should bring to an end 4 1/2 years of court cases and political
wrangling within the commission and between Brussels and BAe.
BAe could launch a further court appeal, however. The company said yesterday
it would not decide whether to challenge the decision until it had been
formally announced. Mr Tony Parry, head of BAe's Brussels office, said
yesterday: 'Clearly we are disappointed that the commission has decided to
apply interest charges in circumstances where we felt that the basis for the
decision was flawed in the first place.'
The commission agreed to BAe's Pounds 150m purchase of Rover in 1988, after
approving a government cash injection into the car group. But the National
Audit Office discovered that the government had also sweetened the sale with
an additional Pounds 44.4m to the aerospace group.
Brussels decided in 1990 that the sweeteners amounted to illegal state aid.
After the ruling was overturned Sir Leon Brittan, then competition
commissioner, pledged a new inquiry. The commission was almost certain to
rule against BAe, because the Court of Justice did not challenge the
substance of the 1990 decision when it overturned the ruling.
Sir Leon's demand in 1990 that the sweeteners should be repaid was seen as a
counterbalance to his decision not to question the Pounds 150m sale price.
He chose not to pursue BAe for repayment of the balance between the price
paid and any higher bid for Rover, in spite of the fact that the National
Audit Office said Pounds 150m was 'substantially' too low.
Sir Leon, a former Conservative cabinet minister, was accused at the time of
being too soft on the government, and last year proposed to omit interest
charges from the repayment.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Foreign waste may force larger N-dump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIREX, the controversial planned store for nuclear waste at Sellafield,
might have to be 10 per cent larger than expected if British Nuclear Fuels
wins backing for its proposals for treating foreign customers' nuclear
waste.
BNF, which is battling to get approval for its Pounds 2.8bn Thorp plant for
reprocessing nuclear fuel, has repeatedly said Sellafield would not be a
nuclear dustbin for other countries' waste because plutonium, uranium and
highly radioactive waste would be sent back to customers.
Under proposals for 'waste substitution' being considered by the government
BNF would send back to foreign customers' a greater degree of high-level
radioactive waste but keep the more bulky low-level and intermediate-level
waste in Britain.
BNF said storage of that waste could push up the necessary capacity of
Nirex's proposed rock chamber by 10 per cent.
Critics have argued that the plant might not generate the cashflow that BNF
projects - Pounds 900m in the first decade of operation - partly because
waste storage costs could rise.
BNF denied that its substitution plans had any effect on Thorp's economics.
'Substitution is just a more elegant solution because it means shipping back
a lower volume,' it said.
One tonne of reprocessed fuel produces 10 cubic cm of high-level waste, a
cubic metre of intermediate-level waste and six cubic metres of low-level
waste. Environmentalists have attacked the Nirex proposals because of the
possible risk of groundwater contamination.
Nirex, which agreed with BNF's estimates of the possible increase in
capacity, said 'it would not be a problem in any case - our estimates of
storage are plus or minus 10 per cent'.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Challenge to news agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESS Association, the UK's national news agency, appears to be facing
the strongest challenge to its effective monopoly for decades.
Two regional newspaper groups, Northcliffe Newspapers and Westminster Press,
have decided to extend the trial of their own internal service, UK News,
until the end of the this month.
A decision will then be taken on whether to make UK News a permanent
business which will try to recruit further subscribers.
A team of more than 20 journalists at UK News headquarters in Leicester puts
together a daily file of about 15,000 words, making it available to
newspapers ranging from The Gloucester Echo at Cheltenham to the Evening
Advertiser at Swindon.
UK News can call on the work of more than 1,700 journalists from the two
newspaper groups around the country.
Critics of the PA service say that the 100,000 or so words filed each day
are too unwieldly and costly for small regional dailies to handle and that
the fees - ranging from more than Pounds 60,000 a year to over Pounds
200,000 - are too high.
Mr Richard Wooldridge, editorial director of Westminster Press - which, like
the Financial Times, is part of the Pearson Group - said he was pleased with
the UK News's quality and speed of output.
An attempt in 1991 to set up an alternative to PA, which included the
Birmingham Post and Mail, did not succeed.
It is not yet clear whether UK News will be a rival to PA, which is owned by
the regional and local press, or is merely an attempt to change the nature
and cost of the PA service.
Mr Colin Webb, editor-in-chief of PA, would only say last night that the
agency was in 'proper talks' with Westminster Press and Northcliffe
Newspapers.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Radio industry wins royalty fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMERCIAL radio industry has won a significant victory in a 15-year
battle to reduce the cost of copyright charges for broadcasting recorded
music.
The Copyright Tribunal, after a six-week hearing last year, has decided to
set a royalty rate for music stations of 5 per cent of annual net revenue,
with reductions down to 2 per cent for smaller radio stations.
Phonographic Performance, which represents the main record companies, had
proposed a range of 5.5 per cent to 20 per cent. During the hearing
Phonographic Performance suggested dropping the maximum to 15 per cent.
Mr Jimmy Gordon, managing director of the Radio Clyde group and chairman of
the copyright committee of the Association of Independent Radio Companies,
said: 'This is not so much a victory as the avoidance of a catastrophe for
the radio industry.'
He said the Phonographic Performance proposals would have meant payments
rising from a total of about Pounds 5m to Pounds 7m a year, with the closure
of some stations. He added that the Copyright Tribunal ruling would mean
royalties would be about Pounds 4.1m a year.
Mr Gordon added that commercial radio stations would still be paying more
for music copyright than any other broadcasters in the world.
Phonographic Performance said yesterday it would not comment until it had
had a chance to consult its members on the tribunal's decision.
The Radio Authority yesterday awarded the first of five regional commercial
radio licences to Bristol-based Galaxy Radio. The licence covers the Severn
Estuary area. Galaxy will have to give up the Bristol licence before taking
on the new regional licence.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Mirror Group trustees object to pension payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES FOR the Mirror Group Pension Scheme are objecting to a proposal
that would allow Maxwell company pensioners to start drawing monthly
payments on the Pounds 188m Common Investment Fund which holds the assets of
all four schemes.
The trustees for the four Maxwell schemes have to agree on the basis of
distribution from the fund before any scheme can receive money. The
government's Pounds 2.5m 'drip-feed' to pay pensioners is nearly exhausted
and those in the Maxwell Communication Staff Scheme and the Maxwell
Communication Works Scheme could face cuts in payments after April if a
resolution is not agreed.
Trustees of the four schemes will meet next week to try to reach an
agreement which will allow each scheme to make some withdrawals.
The dispute centres on the method used to calculate the percentage of the
fund allocated to each scheme. Liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment
Management, the fund management company which was controlled by the late
Robert Maxwell and which managed the Common Investment Fund while he was
alive, have been unable to say which assets belong to which scheme.
Bishopsgate failed to keep accurate records of how much each scheme
contributed to the fund, and its records do not accurately record the date
several substantial blocks of assets were transferred out to banks or to
Maxwell's private interests.
The liquidators, Robson Rhodes, have presented the trustees of all the
schemes with 11 different methods of calculating each scheme's share of the
common fund. Several of these show some schemes to owe the common fund
money.
While the trustees of the Maxwell Private Company Scheme, the works scheme
and the staff scheme are said to agree broadly that requiring pension
schemes to pay money into the fund is unrealistic, Mirror Group Pension
Scheme trustees are said to be baulking at some of the proposals.
About 30 MPs have expressed concern that some trustees are carrying out
their duties 'insensitively'.
Sir John Cuckney, chairman of a trust fund which has been collecting
contributions from companies that had dealings with Maxwell companies, has
given no firm assurances to the pension schemes that the Pounds 6m he has
raised so far will be available for monthly pension payments if assets in
the common fund remain off-limits.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Pit review progress goes underground: The delays to an
eagerly awaited white paper on mine closures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS meant to be short and sharp. When the government buckled under
backbench pressure in October and agreed to review its decision to close 31
coal pits, the widespread assumption was that it was aiming for completion
in January.
When that proved impossible Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry
secretary, said the coal white paper would be published as soon as possible
in February. Now it is unlikely anything will appear before late this month.
After a flurry of activity in the first six weeks of the year the team of
ministers and civil servants leading the coal review has gone quiet. The
heads of the electricity, nuclear and gas industries affected by the review
have heard nothing substantial for weeks.
They are puzzled. After all it is more than three weeks since leaked details
of the draft white paper showed that the government was planning a
relatively simple way out. It rejected the option of reining back nuclear
and gas power, in favour of cutting imports of coal and orimulsion, the
bitumen-based fuel, and persuading electricity generators to buy more
home-produced coal.
The generators' negotiating stance is the main reason for the delay. They
say there is a guaranteed market for only about 40m tonnes of coal over five
years and the government must pay a price if it is to achieve anything near
its 65.5m target.
Ministers are thought to have conceded that extra tonnage must be subsidised
to make it competitive with imports, but arguments remain about what the
subsidy should be, and who should pay the stocking costs for coal surplus to
generators' requirements.
PowerGen, the smaller of the two generators in England and Wales, estimates
stocking costs over five years will be more than Pounds 140m and it wants
the government to pay. The trade department has been considering its
response to Powergen and National Power for more than two weeks.
The delay does not signal that the government has abandoned its draft white
paper plans and is looking for a more radical solution. It is more likely
that the trade department is attempting to square difficult circles
elsewhere before returning to the generators with a compromise.
FIRST it must win acceptance from Brussels for subsidies to keep pits open.
The new competition and energy commissioners are more relaxed about state
aid than their predecessors, but problems remain over any subsidies to coal
after 1995, when the German government plans to reduce its aid to coal.
More difficult still are the trade ministers' problems arising from the
government's slender 20-seat majority in the Commons. The Thatcherite wing
of the Conservative party is uncomfortable about any proposals to prop up
industry with government money, although ministers' preferred solution is
much cheaper than many at first thought - the subsidies and stocking
together are likely to cost less than Pounds 800m over five years.
In delaying full cabinet discussion of the white paper proposals Mr
Heseltine will be able to strengthen his claim for government aid. He will
be able to argue that his department re-examined all the options previously
rejected.
Delaying publication of the white paper could also help deal with potential
dissidents on the left of the party. Even the full 65m tonnes would be
likely to provide a lifeline to fewer than half the threatened pits. Some
Tories have said that is not enough. Some ministers feel their expectations
will fall the longer the review goes on.
In addition, Mr Heseltine may be able to take advantage of this week's
ballots by the National Union of Mineworkers and Nacods pit deputies union
on industrial action, including a one-day strike. If miners vote 'yes' he
can argue that they are out to wreck the industry as in the bad old days. He
can argue that a 'no' means they are past caring.
However close the solution is, it is highly unlikely the white paper will be
published next week.
As the Budget will take up ministers' and parliament's energy and time in
the following week, the week beginning March 22 looks likely. Publication
after April 1 would mean further problems for British Coal - its three-year
contracts with the generators run out on that date and replacements are
unlikely until the white paper is published. Nonetheless, few MPs would be
surprised if publication slipped further.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Lloyd's prepares business plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S OF London is examining changes in five separate areas as part of a
new business plan, Mr David Rowland, Lloyd's chairman, announced yesterday.
The plan is being prepared by the new market board. Under consideration are:
cost reductions and service improvement; new criteria for professional
standards; measures to attract new capital; ways of developing sales in the
United States, western Europe and the Far East; and ideas to deal with heavy
claims arising on old insurance policies.
Most of the working groups are headed by Lloyd's professionals, although Mr
Paul Myners, chairman and chief executive of Gartmore, the fund manager, is
leading the work on professional standards.
It is expected that the plan, the first in Lloyd's 306-year history, will be
complete by late April. It will advocate specific courses of action in some
areas and a framework of possible options in others.
Separately Mr Rowland said that the market's exposure to the bomb at the New
York World Trade Centre last week would be less than Dollars 300m (Pounds
210m).
Three policies - two covering property damage between Dollars 400m and
Dollars 600m - and one covering liability claims between Dollars 4m and
Dollars 104m - are lead by Lloyd's syndicates. London market companies also
participate alongside Lloyd's syndicates on these policies.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Charity says 1m under-25s are jobless
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE MILLION young people under 25 were jobless this January, with the rate
of increase outstripping the increase among the general population, figures
published yesterday by Youthaid, a charity, show.
It said that since the recession started in early 1990 unemployment in the
age group had grown by 455,000, an increase of 91 per cent compared with 86
per cent for the general population.
Government figures published last week showed the age group had one of the
highest percentage increases in long-term unemployment, but the Department
of Employment said it 'found no evidence of the huge numbers of young people
Youthaid claimed were slipping through the net'.
Concern about how best to get jobless young people into the work habit has
caused Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, to concentrate on the
age group. Proposals being examined include forcing long-term unemployed
young people having to take part in some activity - either training or work
experience - or risk losing their benefit.
The Youthaid figures, drawn from a number of sources including official
data, claim government figures underestimate the extent of unemployment in
the group by 84,300.
The department said there were only 6,744 young people waiting eight weeks
or more for a YT place.
Colleges criticised by the Audit Commission for high student drop-out rates
hit back yesterday with high pass marks.
A survey by BTec, the Business and Technology Education Council, showed that
as many as 72 per cent of students on work-related diplomas scored pass
marks, compared with an average 70 per cent pass rate for the equivalent two
A levels on more traditional academic courses.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Met force faces shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SENIOR ranks of the Metropolitan Police could be reduced as part of a
shake-up announced yesterday by Mr Paul Condon, the London force's new
commissioner.
Mr Condon, who took up the post last month and has a reputation for
supporting a more devolved style of management, is considering eliminating
about 700 management posts from the 28,300-strong force to get more officers
on the beat.
He intends to reduce the Metropolitan force's eight areas to five, each
headed by its own chief constable. The local chief constables, plus Mr
Condon and two or three other senior officers, would constitute a new
management board at the centre of the force.
Mr Condon acknowledged that his plans would leave many senior officers at
chief superintendent and superintendent level in an uncertain position. Many
such officers have more than 30 years' service, which gives them protected
pensions, and they are likely to be encouraged to take early retirement.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, and Mr Condon share a belief that police
management has become too top-heavy. The proposals being developed for the
Metropolitan force should release funds to put an extra 1,000 officers on
the beat.
A government inquiry into police responsibilities and rewards headed by Sir
Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT industries, is due to report in May. This is
expected to advocate a reduction in senior ranks and the introduction of a
flatter management structure in forces throughout the country.

THE growing private market in forensic science needs new regulations to
prevent police or defence lawyers using 'cowboys', the Lords' science and
technology committee recommended yesterday.
Lord Dainton, chairman, said the committee was surprised to find the Pounds
40m a year public forensic services 'in much better shape' than it had
expected. But the committee was concerned about the small but growing
private sector.
The committee recommended a system of individual registration for all of the
900 or so forensic scientists working in the UK, to help customers steer
clear of bogus operators.

BRITISH GAS yesterday hit back against Alliance Gas, one of its chief
competitors, for its claims that it could cut domestic gas bills by 10 per
cent if allowed to supply households.
It said: 'Anyone can cut prices for high-volume customers near gas
terminals, but low-volume customers and those farther away would inevitably
pay more.'
The company said that standards of service, safety and security of supply
could be affected by the introduction of competition to the household supply
market.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL Techniques, designer and producer of electronic drives and controls,
announced yesterday that it intends to expand research and production
facilities at its headquarters in Newton, West Glamorgan, creating 175 jobs,
Alan Cane writes.
The Development Board for Wales is spending Pounds 8.5m to build premises
which will be leased by Control Techniques - a 60,000 sq ft extension to the
company's existing premises to house a printed circuit board plant and an
automated factory, and a 25,000 sq ft research and development headquarters.
The announcement was made by Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary.
The company is to invest Pounds 4m in fittings and equipment. Mr Trevor
Wheatley, Control Techniques chairman, said that sites in the US, Italy and
Asia Pacific had been considered but the development board's proposal was
both attractive and acceptable.
Control Techniques makes drives and control mechanisms for a range of
electric motors. Its products are used by AEG, Molins and Simon Engineering
among others.
Last year the company made pre-tax profits of Pounds 6.2m on sales of Pounds
88m. Analysts expect pre-tax profits this year to be as much as Pounds 9m.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Ministers delay London rail plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 2bn CrossRail scheme, by far the biggest public transport project
planned for central London, is in danger of being delayed or cancelled
because of public spending pressures, it emerged yesterday.
The government confirmed that the bill authorising the line's construction,
due for its second reading next week, had been delayed pending a
re-appraisal of the project's costs.
Planned as a link between Paddington and Liverpool Street stations, the
CrossRail project would allow the running of trains between east and west
London. Trains would stop at stations in the West End and the City on the
way.
Commuters could travel straight to some destinations without changing to
London Underground, relieving pressure on the Central Line. The line was due
to open at the end of the decade but the Treasury is now asking whether the
cost of the scheme can be justified given the downturn in central London
employment.
One internal study is understood to have suggested that the recession could
cut 20 per cent off the traffic passenger flows originally forecast for the
service in the year 2001.
The government is under pressure to reach an early decision on the project
because 250 people are already employed on it and Pounds 211m is due to be
spent on detailed design and parliamentary consultation pre-construction
work over the next three years.
London Underground, already concerned about delays to the planned Jubilee
Line extension to Docklands, reacted furiously to the CrossRail threat.
'To question CrossRail now by clutching at the flimsiest of mathematical
straws would be a classic case of economic myopia,' it said.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Fund managers 'beat markets'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE UK pension fund manager outperformed the domestic equity markets
last year, half of them by one percentage point or more, according to the WM
Company, a pension fund performance measurement service.
The average fund in the WM survey earned 20.8 per cent on UK equities
investments, the best performance for more than a decade.
Meanwhile the FT-A All Share Index rose 20.4 per cent last year. The WM
survey measured the performance of 2,500 pension funds with a combined
market value of Pounds 285bn.
Mr Peter Worrington, marketing director of WM, said that much of the
outperformance comes from UK fund managers underweighting in the shares of
Wellcome Plc, whose share prices are fully reflected in the FT-A Index but
only half of whose shares are actually available in the market.
UK fund managers also earned returns which outstripped stock market indices
in north America, continental Europe and Japan for the first time.
Typically, UK fund managers have underperformed in foreign markets by some
margin.
Of all categories of assets, overseas bonds outperformed all others in 1992,
returning 29.1 per cent over the year. Mr Worrington noted that the shift
into overseas bonds started only 18 months ago and that this category now
accounted for 4 per cent of the assets of the average fund.
Much of the expansion into overseas bonds has occurred at the expense of
domestic bonds and about a quarter of all funds surveyed held no UK bonds.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Retailer seeks OFT probe of Kellogg prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHOPRITE, the discount food retailer, is calling for an Office of Fair
Trading investigation into Kellogg, the food manufacturer, which threatened
to stop supplying corn flakes to the chain unless it raised the selling
price.
The chain, which is based in the Isle of Man but operates only in Scotland,
has written to the OFT complaining of 'unwarranted interference' by Kellogg,
which told all retailers in January it would stop supplying them if they
sold 500g packs of the cereal below cost price of 96p.
Mr Deryck Nicholson, Shoprite chairman, said his 40 stores had been selling
corn flakes as a loss-leader at 84p for two years, but made a profit on
other Kellogg brands. He said other large retailers, unable to match
Shoprite's price, may have put pressure on the manufacturer.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, tabled a Commons
question this week to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
asking him to investigate the role other large retailers may have played in
Kellogg's decision to stop supplying Shoprite.
Kellogg insisted yesterday that retail pricing on its products was 'for
individual retailers to determine. However, we also believe it is
unreasonable for retailers to use Kellogg's brands as loss-leaders in order
to build their overall business.'
It said its decision to stop supplying retailers who sold Kellogg brands
below cost was in accordance with the 1976 Resale Prices Act. Mr Nicholson
disputed Kellogg's interpretation of the law.
He said special prices for Kellogg's corn flakes and other products had
featured in the launch campaign of many of its stores. 'Kellogg knew this
and supported us with cash incentives that contributed to advertising and
trade promotion. I don't understand why Kellogg is introducing restrictions
now.'
The case is another example of friction between the rapidly expanding
discount retailing sector and big-name suppliers.
Aldi, the German discount food retailer, complained to the OFT that large
retailers were pressing manufacturers into not supplying it when it opened
in the UK in 1990.
The OFT said it could find 'no firm evidence' but would monitor the
situation.
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission is investigating the perfume market at
the request of the OFT, after a complaint from Superdrug, the cosmetics and
toiletries chain, that some leading perfume manu-facturers were refusing to
supply it.

THE HOUSE of Windsor Collection a catalogue of products from up to 200 royal

achieving sales of Pounds 71m by 1998.
Mr Nicholas Wills, chairman of the Eclectic American Catalogue Company,
which is responsible for the project, said the catalogue 'will be selling a
lifestyle which has traditionally appealed to Americans who recognise the
cachet that the royal warrant conveys'.
He said about 60 per cent of the warrant holders offering products in the
catalogue had not exported to the US before.
Among royal warrant holders in the House of Windsor Collection will be
companies ranging from bedding company Slumberland to small enterprises such
as Bernard Weatherill, the Savile Row tailor, and Tom Smith, maker of
Christmas crackers.
The company aims to exploit a US speciality catalogue market valued at
Dollars 35bn (Pounds 24.60bn) a year.

FT  05 MAR 93 / VW aims to double its market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Volkswagen group, the largest European carmaker, is developing plans
aimed at more than doubling the market share of the VW and Audi makes in the
UK new car market by the late 1990s.
Volkswagen acquired VAG United Kingdom, the distributor of Volkswagen and
Audi vehicles in Britain, from Lonrho in December for Pounds 124m.
Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman
of the VW volume car division, outlined aggressive plans for the development
of the two makes in the UK, which has been one of the German carmaker's
weaker markets in Europe.
He said that the VW brand would be aiming to gain a share of 7 per cent to 9
per cent by 1996/97, compared with a share last year of only 4.1 per cent.
The Audi make would aim for 4 per cent to 5 per cent of UK new car sales
compared with only 1.2 per cent in 1992.
The German group's aggressive ambitions will cause unease among rival
carmakers, whose profitability in the UK market has already been placed
under heavy pressure during the protracted recession. VW faces a forecast
drastic fall in sales in Germany, its most important market, in the next two
years and the UK is one of the few markets expected to grow this year,
albeit from a very low level.
Competition is set to intensify in the UK market as the three Japanese
carmakers, Nissan, Toyota and Honda, build up local production in Britain
and VW's ambitions will pose a serious challenge to the established UK
market leaders Ford, Vauxhall (General Motors) and Rover.
Mr Goeudevert said: 'There is no reason why we should not reach in the UK
the average level we have in the rest of Europe.'
Together the VW and Audi makes captured about 14.7 per cent of west European
new car sales last year, but held a share of only 5.2 per cent in the UK.
'VW missed the train in the past in not getting the share we did on the
Continent,' said Mr Goeudevert.
It is likely that the German carmaker will have to seek to increase
significantly its penetration of the large fleet and company car sectors of
the UK car market, which have already become the target of the Japanese car
makers. Cars registered for company use account for more than half of all UK
new car sales.
Mr Goeudevert said that while VW sought to cut its cost base in Germany it
had to continue to invest 'in the right direction'.

FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Boeing lowers sights for new aircraft
sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOEING, the world's largest manufacturer of commercial jets, has reduced by
5 per cent its long-term forecast for new aircraft deliveries in its latest
market outlook.
But despite the industry's turmoil, Boeing expects world air travel and
demand for new airliners to recover and show substantial growth by the end
of the decade.
In its annual study of the airliner market published today, Boeing forecasts
new aircraft deliveries totalling more than 1,200 jets valued at Dollars
815bn over the next 18 years. This is 5 per cent less than the Dollars 857bn
of new deliveries over the same period the Seattle-based company had
forecast last year.
The study shows that while aircraft deliveries totalling 789 jets worth
Dollars 44.3bn remained at near-record levels last year, the combination of
over-capacity, slow traffic growth and airline losses and financing
difficulties led to a 6.6 per cent drop in new orders compared with 1991.
Boeing said airlines ordered 482 aircraft worth Dollars 29.9bn last year
compared with Dollars 32bn worth of orders in 1991 and as much as Dollars
71bn worth in 1990.
All three big manufacturers - Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus - also
had cancellations and deferrals from financially strapped customers. This
has led to sharp cuts in production and employment. Boeing is cutting output
by 35 per cent and plans to shed 28,000 jobs over the next 18 months. After
declining in 1991, air travel grew by 6.9 per cent last year. However, Mr
Richard Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, said much of this
growth was the result of uneconomic air fares that produced continuing
losses for many airlines.
The recovery of the commercial aircraft business will hinge on a general
improvement in the world economy and a return to profitable airline
operations. Although airlines lost more than Dollars 10bn during the last
three years, Boeing expects that larger airlines will now evolve as
integration and consolidation continues. These larger airlines will have
better control of their operations and, while the future airline market will
still be competitive, Boeing believes it will be more stable.
Air travel is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 5.4 per cent
between now and 2010, according to Boeing. This growth will be led by the
Asia-Pacific markets which are expected to account for over 40 per cent of
growth over the next 18 years.
Of the 12,000 or more new aircraft to be delivered between now and 2010,
about 30 per cent will be needed to replace older and noisier jets.
However, the rate of replacement of older jets has been slower than
expected. Only 155 aircraft were retired last year, but Boeing says more
than 750 were parked in the Arizona and California deserts at the end of
last year. Boeing expects many of these parked aircraft will never return to
service.
The average aircraft size is also expected to continue to grow over the next
18 years from an average of 176 seats in 1980 to 193 seats in 1992 and to
227 seats in 2010.
Boeing said its market share had not deteriorated in spite of changing
competition. The Seattle group took 57 per cent of orders last year while
Airbus won 29 per cent and McDonnell Douglas 11 per cent with other smaller
manufacturers accounting for the remaining 3 per cent.
Boeing's forecasts are roughly in line with those recently made by its two
competitors.
Airbus is estimating demand for 13,500 aircraft over the next 20 years while
McDonnell Douglas has forecast a total requirement for 14,000 new jets
during the same period.

FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Foreign companies warned over higher US
taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN companies would be rash to think the US Congress has relented in
its demands for higher taxes on international businesses, Washington tax
lawyers told a meeting of the American Chamber of Commerce in London
yesterday.
The EC will need to lobby in unison if President Bill Clinton's ambitious
deficit reduction package, intended to raise a net Dollars 245bn over the
next five years, is not to include swingeing new transfer pricing rules, the
meeting was told.
Multinational companies operating in the US - the largest group of which are
headquartered in Britain - breathed a deep sigh of relief two weeks ago when
Mr Clinton said in his State of the Union address that new transfer pricing
rules would raise just Dollars 3.8bn over five years. His campaign speeches
last year had hinted that foreign concerns would have to pay an extra
Dollars 40bn in taxes.
However, Mr Greg Jenner, partner in the US law firm McDermott, Will &amp; Emery,
warned that higher taxes could yet be levied. President Clinton might be
forced to find a further Dollars 20bn in revenue to fund programmes demanded
by Congress as a price for approving the administration's deficit reduction
package. 'It is important to keep in mind that the president's proposals
were the first shot,' he said. 'Foreign companies are perceived as easy
targets in the US, and should not think they are out of the woods.'
Demands that foreign companies pay more taxes are based on popular views
that, in order to minimise taxes, many manipulate prices charged on
components passing from parent companies to their US subsidiaries.
Foreign companies complain that these charges are unfounded, and say the new
rules proposed by President Clinton - which call for transfer price analyses
to be carried out at the same time as tax returns are filed - will show
this. In the US, economists worry that higher taxes, and the uncertainty
created by the transfer pricing debate, will discourage new foreign
investment.
Mr Michael Burrell, managing director of the lobbying group Westminster
Strategy, said Mr Clinton's populist appeal meant that lobbying by European
companies 'will have to be framed in terms of the interest of the American
people, and what foreign investment means in terms of US jobs'.
Given the strength of domestic lobbying pressure for foreign companies to
pay higher taxes, he insisted that French, German or British companies would
need to make their case as European companies. 'Europeans have to be seen as
saying the same thing, in the same voice, with co-ordinated action
formulated in coalition.'
Companies needed to target four bodies: the European Commission, EC national
governments, members of the Group of Seven industrial countries, and US
state governments - particularly the home bases of such key US legislators
as Congressman Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, chairman of the House ways and
means committee, and Senator Daniel Moynihan of New York, chairman of the
Senate finance committee.

US CRITICISM of the European Airbus programme for unfair competition and
hidden state subsidies was bluntly rejected in Germany yesterday as both
hypocritical and absurd.
At the same time, the German aerospace industry is calling for more state
support as a 'strategic industry', and condemned its own government for
inadequate planning and erratic decision-making.
The twin onslaught from the German Aerospace Industry Federation came as the
chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace Airbus, Mr Hartmut Mehdorn, revealed
that 70 per cent of the company's 23,000 workforce would be put on
short-time working in the coming months.
According to Mr Wolfgang Piller, president of the German Aerospace Industry
Federation, the real level of US government support for its own civil
aviation industry was far greater than in Europe, and European governments
should adopt similar programmes,
He accused the US Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) of discriminating
blatantly against European manufacturers, such as Airbus, in its
registration system for new aircraft, charging foreign manufacturers for a
service it provided free to the US industry.
He also said the FAA introduced new safety regulations and other
requirements just at the moment when new European aircraft had to be
registered, forcing them to comply with rules not imposed on existing US
aircraft.
At the same time Mr Piller, also general manager of Deutsche Aerospace,
roundly attacked his own government for its lack of a coherent aerospace
programme, and for erratic and unpredictable planning of its defence
spending.
His sharp criticism was delivered at a review of the dismal prospects for
the German aerospace industry in particular, and the world industry in
general, at the publication of the German federation's annual report.
He estimated that both turnover and employment in the German aerospace
industry, Europe's fastest growing, had fallen by 10 per cent in 1992.
Employment in the industry had dropped from 95,000 to 80,000 in the past two
years. In the defence aviation sector, it was impossible to plan ahead
because of the erratic nature of budget cuts, Mr Piller said.
The principal target of his attack was Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister,
who is at loggerheads with the industry over his attempts to cut back the
European Fighter Aircraft programme. Mr Piller accused Mr Ruhe of behaving
as if the EFA project was not an international agreement, and as if he could
simply issue orders to the German industry alone. All the contracts were
agreed with the other three partners, Britain, Italy and Spain.

FT  05 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Kantor supports 'new trade rules'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US will support 'new rules of engagement' for international trade in a
world undergoing 'global transition', Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, said last night.
In his first public policy address since taking office, he talked of a 'new
set of standards about what is productive behaviour'. He and President Bill
Clinton, who spoke on trade last Friday, have yet to define the new rules
and standards they will seek, and probably have yet to devise them. But they
are certain to recast the debate.
'We intend to avoid getting bogged down in long theological debates about
free trade and protectionism. It is a senseless exercise and ultimately
futile,' Mr Kantor told semiconductor industry executives.
Like its predecessor, the Clinton administration fully supports completion
of the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks, but not 'simply to show
progress after so many years of effort.' It must have real gains and leave
the US the ability 'to rigorously enforce our trade laws', Mr Kantor said.
The administration wants Japan and Europe to take on 'new responsibilities
in return for the opportunity to compete in the new world economy'.
The US-Japan semiconductor agreement is a case in point, Mr Kantor said. 'We
are resolute and determined to get results' from the 1991 trade pact, which
promised foreign chipmakers greater access to the Japanese market. He said
he would monitor market share data to determine compliance with the
market-opening agreement in which Japan recognised US expectations that the
foreign share of the Japanese chip market should rise above 20 per cent by
the end of last year.
Mr Kantor is expected to take a firm line so as not to show weakness in his
first confrontation with Japan. If, as expected, the 20 per cent market
share target is not reached, he could impose sanctions. However, the
Japanese are expected to make proposals aimed to avoid them.
The 14 per cent EC tariff on semiconductors was rarely mentioned during the
Bush administration. Mr Kantor, though, gave it high visibility. 'We find it
unacceptable that the EC remains reluctant to eliminate the tariff,' he
said, adding that the latest EC offer to lower tariffs to 7 per cent was
unacceptable.

<TEXT>
SIEMENS of Germany is to make a joint bid with the Christiani &amp; Nielsen
group of Thailand (CNT) for construction of an Dollars 800m elevated railway
system for Bangkok, CNT and Siemens executives said yesterday.
The two-line, 16-km railway is to be operated by the Tanayong group, a
Thailand property company, under a contract with the Bangkok Metropolitan
Authority.
It looks likely to be the first of three competing mass-transit projects for
Bangkok to start construction.
The streets of Thailand's capital city are notoriously congested.
Christiani &amp; Nielsen, the international construction group, has its
headquarters in Thailand following the recent reverse takeover of the Danish
parent company by its dynamic Thai subsidiary.
Siemens has expertise in railway systems and rolling stock.
Bidding for the Tanayong project is expected to take place in June or July.
Mr John Millard, CNT's chief executive, also announced that his company had
won its largest ever Thai contract, an order for a Baht 2.45bn (Pounds
67.1m) shopping centre for the Siam Retail group near Bangkok.
This so-called Fashion Island will be built on a greenfield site and have
200,000 square metres of retail and commercial space, plus a further 155,000
square metres for parking.
CNT is negotiating at the same time to build two shopping complexes in
northern China.
Stockbrokers say it is also hoping to win a contract for a water treatment
project in Bangkok, in association with the British company, North West
Water.

THE US expects Germany and Japan to take 'decisive, politically difficult'

They should follow the Clinton administration's tax and spending package, he

He made clear that the US does not at present intend to re-open the accord

limit new subsidies in marketing and export finance and other areas 'on a

Exchanges on trade would be 'vigorous' and 'occasionally sharp', Mr Dobbins
predicted. But relations would be 'mutually productive' as Europe benefited
from US growth and success in opening markets.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Doubts over dividing Argentina's oil giant: A privatisation
controversy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST as the dust began settling in Argentina after last year's battle over
the privatisation of YPF, the national oil company, some Argentines are
having second thoughts about its sale.
Except for a fringe of left-wing and ultra-nationalist extremists, nobody is
opposing the principle of privatising YPF, the oldest state oil company in
the world. The debate is whether it is right to sell as a single unit
Argentina's largest company, which has an estimated value of Dollars 8bn and
controls half the oil industry.
The government is trying to avoid a reopened debate. It has already given up
privatising all of YPF, Congress having made it keep 20 per cent of the
shares. Officials do not want the privatisation, due to begin this year,
disrupted further.
But critics say selling YPF as a single company could allow buyers to build
an oligopoly. YPF still controls over half Argentina's oil production,
refinery and retail sectors, despite a radical scaling down over the past
two years which has reduced its workforce to about 10,000 from a peak of
52,000 in August 1990.
Mr Daniel Montamat, a former president of YPF under the previous Radical
government and now an energy consultant, says: 'You need (to create)
competition and establish the new role of YPF before it is privatised.'
YPF's president, Mr Jose Estenssoro - who refused to be interviewed for this
article - would retort that the government completely deregulated the market
in January 1991.
Concern about market concentration is not just an opposition bugbear. Mr
Agustn Castano, principal at US management consultants Booz, Allen &amp;
Hamilton's office in Buenos Aires, warns: 'It could be very difficult to
support a competitive environment by privatising YPF as a single, integrated
company with a very large share of the market. It is not impossible, but it
is difficult.'
Furthermore, Argentina has a history of strong cartels, inoperative
anti-trust policies and a weak judiciary that does not enforce existing
competition laws.
The government plans to float 70 per cent of YPF gradually on local and
international equity markets, spreading share ownership broadly, in
imitation of international corporations. But last year's mixed reception of
privatisation stocks could mean that future issues will meet insufficient
retail demand, leading to YPF's transfer to one of Argentina's big
family-owned conglomerates, not renowned for fiercely efficient management.
These groups have grown even stronger during Argentina's privatisation
process, buying up significant assets that were previously state-owned, and
could win control of YPF. Effective control could be bought for about
Dollars 2.5bn-Dollars 4bn (Pounds 1.8bn-Pounds 2.8bn). Many of these groups,
such as Compana Naviera Perez Companc, a holding company heavily involved in
the energy business, have already bought up YPF assets. Buying into YPF
itself would fit neatly with their new operations.
Alternatively, ownership could become so diffuse that YPF's management would
become a law unto itself. Argentina has little experience of accountability
or shareholder rights.
Moreover, with 20 per cent of equity held by the government and 10 per cent
by the unions, YPF could remain under effective public sector control. This
might make it less efficient, more vulnerable to political interference and
thus less attractive to investors.
However, the government has yet to announce YPF's flotation mechanism, which
could include safeguards against these problems. One possible solution would
be to split YPF. Mr Montamat says two or three integrated oil companies
could be carved out of YPF.
However, Mr Matas Bourdieu, of the government's privatisation team, says:
'Operationally, it is not possible to divide YPF. The scheme we used was to
spin off surplus areas and reorganise YPF, (making it) very efficient. This
is (feasible) only under one company. YPF cannot be divided into different
units.'
The government is now re-examining its plans: one official said yesterday
that Mr Domingo Cavallo, economy minister, might revise some aspects of the
privatisation in coming weeks.
The official did not expect the revisions to be extensive, but Mr Cavallo
was reviewing 'the composition of assets that make up YPF' with a view to
further reducing its size.
The amount and timing of the initial offering - until now 20 per cent of the
company's equity was to have been offered in the third quarter of this year
on local and international markets - may also be revised. A larger offering
was a possibility, the official said.
The strategy up to date is regarded as successful. With US consultants
McKinsey &amp; Co, YPF identified superfluous activities such as its tanker
fleet, drilling crews and pipelines and began selling them off. This process
financed its restructuring - designed by consultants Arthur D Little - and
increased profitability by focusing on production, refining and retailing,
thereby raising the value of the company.
Since 1990, YPF has raised about Dollars 2bn from asset sales and has turned
the losses made through much of the 1980s into profits: profit after tax in
1991 was Dollars 245m on sales of Dollars 4.03bn, compared with profits of
just Dollars 41m in 1990.
Still, there are some who advocate simply selling YPF's assets and winding
up the company. This would eliminate the threat to competition, and might
even raise more money for the government. However, if there is little chance
of YPF being broken up, there is practically no chance of closing it down:
winning public opinion and the politicians over to YPF's privatisation in
the first place was difficult enough.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Mexican party talks collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S centre-right opposition, the National Action Party (PAN), has
walked out of talks on party finance reform in protest at revelations that a
select group of businessmen has promised to give the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI) hundreds of millions of dollars.
The negotiations are intended to lead to a comprehensive new law on campaign
finance that would cap party spending in elections and force parties to
publish sources of their finance.
The declared aim of the reform is to allow the opposition parties to compete
more effectively with the PRI, which has run Mexico for 64 years.
But, after it was revealed that some 30 prominent businessmen had pledged at
a dinner last week to raise about Dollars 25m each for the PRI, the PAN
appears to have had second thoughts about supporting the reforms.
The governing party has argued that the money will go into a special trust
to build up its capital and not be used directly in next year's presidential
campaign.
There would be nothing illegal about the donations but the opposition has
argued they would give undue influence to a powerful group of businessmen.
The fact that opposition parties cannot raise such amounts has also raised
questions about the government's commitment to create a fairer political
system.
The PRI has said that the dinner last week was only one of many the party is
holding to boost its finances, and that it will also be raising money from
traditional supporters, such as the labour sector. Officials argue that the
overtures to the private sector are a positive step in that the PRI would no
longer be dependent on government money.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Congress may back deeper spending cuts: Clinton's deficit
reduction plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESS may agree to proposals for as much as Dollars 5bn-Dollars 10bn in
additional spending cuts next year to broaden support for the
deficit-reduction plan presented by President Bill Clinton.
Budget conservatives in the Democratic party will present a list of spending
cuts totalling Dollars 83bn (Pounds 58.4bn) over five years, of which up to
Dollars 60bn may win sufficient backing in Congress. Despite nervousness
that the overall package might be jeopardised if too many cuts are added,
the Clinton administration and the Democratic leadership in Congress have
agreed to consider further measures.
'We are being asked to produce a list that is saleable,' said Congressman
Timothy Penny of Minnesota, a leader of the Democratic group seeking further
cuts. While deeper spending cuts may eventually win votes from some
Republicans, Democrats are assuming that they cannot count on any Republican
support as they assess likely backing for controversial cuts.
Mr Clinton's plan, outlined last month, includes Dollars 247bn of spending
cuts and Dollars 246bn of tax increases in 1994-97, but these are offset by
Dollars 109bn of spending increases and Dollars 60bn of tax breaks.
Overall, the package is projected by the White House to save a cumulative
total of Dollars 473bn over five years in comparison with the current path
of spending.
But the Congressional Budget Office, in its own analysis of Mr Clinton's
plan, calculates that his spending cuts will save about Dollars 21bn less
than he projects over five years, and his tax increases will bring in
Dollars 27bn less than he expects.
One serious discrepancy concerns projected savings from the possibility that
the Treasury could lower its net interest costs by selling more debt at
shorter maturities, which the CBO declines to include in its estimates.
The CBO's estimate of the deficit in 1997 is, however, almost identical to
the Dollars 206bn projected by the White House, because it is more
optimistic about revenues from taxes unchanged by the Clinton plan.
Nevertheless, many Democrats in Congress believe voters will be watching
closely to see if the bill they pass matches the Dollars 473bn in deficit
reduction promised by the Clinton plan. The CBO numbers may, therefore,
strengthen the hand of those advocating further cuts.
'I think it helps our cause. At the very least they need to come to our list
of cuts to fill the hole,' said Mr Penny.
Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, the senior Republican on the House Budget
Committee, also aims to match President Clinton's Dollars 473bn deficit
reduction in his own plan, but to do so without raising any taxes. This is
expected to involve around Dollars 400bn in spending cuts and some Dollars
75bn in user fees and interest savings.
Republicans do not expect, however, that they will be able to do much to
stop the Democratic majority from passing a budget resolution that broadly
parallels the Clinton programme.
This resolution, including only the broad outlines of spending, is expected
to be taken up by the House Budget Committee next Wednesday, and could come
to the floor of the House for a vote the following week.
The hardest congressional battle is likely to come when each individual
spending cut and tax measure comes in for scrutiny in a fuller budget
reconciliation bill.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Fall in US new orders steeper than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Commerce Department yesterday reported a bigger than expected decline
in new orders for manufactured goods in January. It is the latest in a
string of reports pointing to a slowing in the pace of economic expansion
from the robust growth of the fourth quarter of last year.
State unemployment insurance claims also rose sharply in the week ending
February 20, a sign that labour markets remain sluggish.
New orders fell 1.3 per cent between December and January against
expectations of a drop of less than 1 per cent. However, the decline mainly
reflected weakness in the volatile aircraft sector and only partly offset
the strong 6.1 per cent increase between November and December.
Orders were 8.7 per cent higher than in January last year, suggesting that
the outlook for manufacturing is improving, albeit erratically.
Claims for unemployment insurance rose 26,000 to 351,000 in the week ended
February 20, a surprisingly large increase given that the week included a
public holiday.
The weaker tone of economic reports has helped sustain a vigorous rally in
bond markets but raised apprehension about the outlook for jobs, which
remain scarce in spite of the rapid fourth quarter expansion.
Analysts predicted that February employment figures, out today, would show a
modest rise in payrolls of about 110,000, well below the increase normal in
past recoveries and not sufficient to reduce the 7.1 per cent unemployment
rate significantly.

PRESIDENT Frederick Chiluba declared a state of emergency in Zambia last
night, citing a threat to security, Reuter reports from Lusaka.
He made no specific allegations but diplomats said he was referring to an
alleged coup plot to overthrow his 15-month-old government by fomenting
civil strife.
Reports of a possible coup plot codenamed 'Zero Option' surfaced last week.
The president of the main opposition United National Independence Party
(UNIP), Mr Kebby Musikotwane, subsequently said he had received a copy of
the plot from radical elements in the party.
He said this was not official UNIP policy and he had passed the information
to the government for further investigation. Police questioned Mr
Musikotwane and other senior UNIP officials.

INDIA'S prime minister, Mr P V Narasimha Rao, who is battling to rebuild his

the defence minister, to take control of the local authorities in Bombay,
the city which bore the brunt of the violence.
Mr Pawar, who is from Bombay, resigned from the cabinet yesterday to become
chief minister of Maharashtra state, which includes Bombay.
The move is being presented as an effort to bolster the state administration
with a strong and experienced leader who has held the job of chief minister
three times already.
But Mr Rao's decision is widely viewed as an attack on Mr Pawar, who sees
himself as a potential future premier.

FT  05 MAR 93 / UN plans to send 28,000 troops to lawless Somalia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY-EIGHT thousand United Nations troops, empowered to use force, would
replace American-led contingents in Somalia from May 1, under a plan
submitted yesterday to the Security Council.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, made the recommendation
in a written report following discussions with President Bill Clinton and US
officials. The UN Security Council is expected to approve the plan when it
is debated later this month.
The proposed size of the force, considerably larger than the number of UN
troops in either former Yugoslavia or Cambodia, surprised many diplomats,
including US officials.
However, Mr Boutros Ghali emphasised that there was no functioning
government in Somalia, no police force or disciplined army and that the
atmosphere of lawlessness and tension was far from eliminated as evident in
new outbreaks of violence, including against UN and US troops in Mogadishu.
Under his plan up to 5,000 US soldiers would remain as part of the UN
operation, which would be called Unosom II.
The first Unosom mission, a small ineffectual force, was superseded by
President George Bush's despatch of American troops to Somalia at the end of
last year to ensure deliveries of food and relief to the starving. About
15,000 US soldiers remain.
Turkish lieutenant general Cevik Bir has been named to command the new UN
force, with US major general Thomas Montgomery as his deputy.
Urging a smooth transfer to the UN of the current operation, in which troops
from some 20 countries are participating, Mr Boutros Ghali warned that any
hiatus would be exploited by warring gangs. But a transition would have to
be achieved area by area and he could not say when it might be completed.
He offered no cost estimate for the plan. The UN is reeling under the
financial impact of peacekeeping operations unprecedented in four
continents.
Mr Jan Eliasson, in charge of UN humanitarian operations, yesterday appealed
for international contributions totalling Dollars 166.5m for the 'first step
towards rebuilding the economic and social fabric of Somalia.' He said more
than 2m Somalis were threatened by starvation.

FT  05 MAR 93 / South Africa approaches moment of truth: Which way Buthelezi
moves is at the heart of constitutional talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the proud but unpredictable leader of the mainly
Zulu Inkatha Freedom Party in South Africa, is about to face his moment of
truth.
For months Chief Buthelezi has fulminated in public over government efforts
to agree a post-apartheid constitution bilaterally with the African National
Congress, blood-rivals of Inkatha. His two adversaries have now done their
deal - which calls for multiracial power sharing to the end of the century -
and they must sell it to the belligerent chief from Natal.
That process begins today, when the ruling National Party, the ANC, Inkatha
and as many as 20 other organisations (no one can be sure exactly how many
will attend until they count heads at the door) meet for two days of talks
to plan the resumption of multi-party constitutional talks. Those talks, in
the forum known as the Convention for a Democratic South Africa, collapsed
10 months ago. They are due to resume at the end of this month.
But the resumption will depend on this week's so-called 'multi-party
planning conference', which none of the party leaders will attend. The
conference will bring together lower-level delegations spanning the
political spectrum.
The white supremacists will be represented in multi-party talks for the
first time, by the small and relatively moderate Afrikaner Volksunie
(Afrikaner People's Party), while the ultra-right Conservative Party may
also attend. Sitting opposite them will be black supremacists from the Pan
Africanist Congress, who intend to show up despite government efforts to bar
them.
The aim of such an inclusive conference is to ensure that any new
constitution is viewed as legitimate by the whole of South Africa's
fractious population. But the harsh truth is that there will be a
constitutional settlement in South Africa, with or without the acquiescence
of these 20-odd groups - and that means, with or without Chief Buthelezi.
The cost of an imposed settlement, however, would be frighteningly high.
Over the next few days and weeks, Chief Buthulezi faces the most critical
decision of his political career which has spanned over 40 years and has
seen him lauded as an opponent of apartheid as well as condemned for
collaboration.
He must decide whether to compromise over a constitutional deal which he
substantially rejects - he opposes power-sharing and demands maximum
devolution of power to regions in a confederal state - or whether to stand
on principle to oppose a multi-party agreement.
Chief Buthelezi must know that he cannot prevent a deal: the ruling National
Party will go to great lengths to accommodate him (and even his rivals in
the ANC insist they wish to be conciliatory); but National Party ministers
have made plain, in the words of one Inkatha official, that they would
'ditch anybody' rather than jeopardise their power-sharing deal with the
ANC.
'Chief Buthelezi does not want to be seen as a Savimbi in the talks,' says
Mr Oscar Dhlomo, political analyst and former lieutenant to the Inkatha
leader. He was referring to the role played by Mr Jonas Savimbi, leader of
the Angolan Unita movement, widely credited with having wrecked Angola's
multi-party elections.
Faced with pressure to negotiate from western embassies, from the National
Party itself and from white businessmen (traditionally his allies and
financial backers), Chief Buthelezi appears to have moderated his
intransigence. The conference which begins today may provide a measure of
this new flexibility.
Still, the debate is likely to generate a large amount of heat and light
before conclusions are reached. For most of the participants in the talks
feel - understandably - that they have been convened simply to rubber-stamp
an agreement reached bilaterally between ANC and the government.
That agreement calls for multi-party power-sharing at cabinet level for five
years after the first multiracial elections (due to be held sometime between
the end of 1993 and April next year).
It also calls for a measure of power-sharing between central and regional
governments, through devolution of certain powers; but no agreement has yet
been reached on which powers should be devolved. This means, in effect, that
the form of the future state - a federation or a unitary nation - has not
yet been agreed. And that is Inkatha's largest concern.
Inkatha intends to raise this issue at the current talks, and sparks could
fly. Inkatha wants each new South African region to negotiate its own
separate constitution - like the original American states. This will be
opposed by the government and the ANC, which want the issue decided
centrally. For though the ANC has shifted significantly away from a highly
centralised state, toward a model where regions have substantial powers, it
continues to oppose Inkatha's model, which is at best loosely federal.
Considerable rhetoric will no doubt be expended on this issue over the next
few days, before a date and agenda are set for multi-party talks. But
however angry the debate, the ANC and Government will do all they can to see
that Chief Buthelezi remains in negotiations.
For if Chief Buthelezi is left to seek a separate peace for Natal - perhaps
even fulfilling a recent veiled threat to secede from South Africa - greater
violence can be the only result. Natal has one quarter of the country's
population. It is hard to see that a new constitution can succeed without
it.

                     government under the terms of the new Constitution
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
The main protagonists:
Who they represent and what they want
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
PRESIDENT FW DE KLERK and his ruling National Party claim to
represent all of South Africa's minorities (but especially whites). He
heads a formidable party machine which could win a quarter to a third
of the national vote, with the support of most of the country's 3.8m
white voters, a majority of the 2m coloured and 660,000 Asian voters,
plus some of the 16m black voters. Mr de Klerk has already seen his
main demand -    that South Africa be ruled by power-sharing -
granted in bilateral negotiations with the African National Congress.
It was agreed that power would be shared between majority and minority
parties at cabinet level through the end of the century. He will now
push his power-sharing demands one step further by calling for
substantial devolution of power from central government to regional and
local government, as a further measure to dilute the power of a
21st-Century black government in Pretoria.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
MR NELSON MANDELA, president of the African National Congress, can
count on support from a majority of the 16m black voters (more than 70
per cent of the country's total). But privately the organisation is not
certain that it can win more than 50 per cent of the total vote, as it
will have almost no white support and only minority support among
coloureds and Asians. It also has problems with organising in the black
communities. Still, the ANC seems certain to be the single largest
party in any future government, and could win as much as 60 per cent of
the vote if it can improve organisation and raise a large election
fund. The ANC's ultimate demand is majority rule, but it has agreed to
five years of power-sharing at cabinet level (though it wants to retain
effective control over most cabinet decisions despite the presence of
minority parties). Meanwhile, its most immediate concern is over
devolution of power: the ANC wants a more centralised system than
envisaged by the National Party or Inkatha (see below).
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
CHIEF MANGOSUTHU BUTHELEZI combines a political role (he is Chief
Minister of the KwaZulu black homeland and leader of the Inkatha
Freedom Party) with the traditional tribal role as a prince of the Zulu
royal house. He has cleverly exploited both positions to underpin his
support in Natal province, his regional base, where strong support from
whites and minority support among Zulus may guarantee him half or more
of the regional vote (Inkatha would probably win only 5 to 10 per cent
of the national vote). As a regional leader who can claim no national
political role, Chief Buthelezi's hope is to be able to insist on
maximum devolution of power to the regions: he demands a federal South
Africa with greater devolution than envisaged by the National Party and
far more than that proposed by the ANC. He recently published what
amounts to a secessionist constitution for Natal. Nevertheles, his
support will be crucial if a future national constitution is to succeed.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Japan split over banks' bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S financial authorities are deeply divided over how commercial banks
should deal with mounting bad debts.
The Bank of Japan and the finance ministry favour different approaches. This
threatens to complicate the banks' task as they set about writing off
non-performing loans left after the collapse of the boom economy of the late
1980s.
The outcome of the tussle over how to rid the banking system of bad loans
could determine how Japan's financial system emerges from its present
crisis. The Bank of Japan appears to want a far-reaching restructuring of
the financial system, while the finance ministry favours a more gradualist
approach in an attempt to keep most financial institutions afloat.
The Bank of Japan is urging the commercial banks to take swift action to
write off bad loans. They want other banks to follow the lead of Sumitomo
Bank, which recently wrote off Y100bn (Pounds 584m) of failed
property-related loans.
Bank officials are warning the main banks that they may have only limited
room for manoeuvre in writing off bad loans.
The banks are making strong operating profits partly because successive
reductions in the Bank of Japan's official interest rate has reduced the
cost to the banks of borrowing from the central bank.
As these reductions in interest rates have not been fully passed on to
customers, the banks have been able to widen their profit margins.
However, the BoJ is warning banks that in the next year or two, as growth
recovers, interest rates may start rising, cutting into banks' profits. This
would limit their ability to pay for bad loans from profits.
Officials at the Bank of Japan recognise that this policy would require some
banks to declare losses for the first time in their history.
Finance ministry officials want to take a more gradual approach to the
write-offs. One official said: 'It is not practical or possible to write off
bad loans in one or two strokes in the near future. It is all very well for
Sumitomo to write off bad loans but it is a very profitable bank. For less
profitable banks it is much more difficult.'
The model for the finance ministry approach is the recent deal to bail out
Nippon Housing Loan, the deeply troubled housing finance arm of several
commercial banks. Rather than write off Nippon Housing's bad loans swiftly,
its nine banks have agreed to forgo interest on outstanding loans worth
Y830bn for up to 10 years.
Agricultural banks, led by Norinchukin, will continue to receive an interest
rate of 4.5 per cent on their loans to Nippon Housing.
Tokyo bankers say the joint body set up by the banks earlier this year to
help them dispose of their bad loans is working very slowly.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Conservative Hewson upstages Keating among the workers:
Australia's opposition leader is doing a good job of looking at home with
ordinary people
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE conventional wisdom was clear: once the election campaign was under way,
Mr Paul Keating, Australia's Labor prime minister, would walk all over Mr
John Hewson, the inexperienced conservative leader.
It has not happened. One of the few surprises in a largely predictable
campaign has been the contrast between Mr Hewson's robust electioneering and
the tentative efforts of the prime minister.
Mr Keating's lacklustre performance appears to stem from his dislike of the
aimless and occasionally unsettling round of publicity stunts intended to
guarantee vital footage on the bulletins of the five television networks.
Unlike Mr Bob Hawke, the former prime minister ousted after a leadership
battle 15 months ago, Mr Keating looks uncomfortable chatting to pensioners
in shopping centres or taking questions from ordinary voters.
But Mr Hewson, leader of the Liberal/National Party coalition, has kept up a
ceaseless whirl of activity which focuses as often as possible on exchanges
with factory workers, shoppers, commuters, and even surfers taking a break
from the waves.
The conservative strategy is to get the media to show the opposition leader
as often as possible in the company of ordinary people, especially those who
might be thought of as natural Labor voters.
It is a clever attempt to combat Mr Keating's coruscating parliamentary
attacks on the alleged remoteness of the conservative leadership, which he
has frequently labelled the 'born to rule brigade'.
But the surprise is that Mr Hewson seems genuinely at ease among the voters,
even when he knows that few of those he is talking to are likely to be
conservative supporters.
Touring a car plant in the industrial Melbourne suburb of Dandenong, he
looks incongruous in a crisp white business shirt and striped tie,
surrounded by oily machinery and boiler-suited fitters.
The Greek, Italian and Lebanese names on the time clock near the door
suggest that many of the workers are from Melbourne's large immigrant
community, which traditionally gives solid support to Labor.
Yet Mr Hewson is noticeably eager to talk to workers as well as managers.
Most say afterwards that he seemed interested and asked sensible questions.
A few say they might even vote for him.
Later, he gives a bravura performance during a question and answer session
at a public meeting in a marginal constituency. Heckled by demonstrators, he
simply keeps talking until they give up and leave.
His weakness is a tendency to use precious expressions such as 'golly gosh'
and 'gee whiz' when under pressure. Many Australians find such language
risible compared to the earthier tone of everyday conversation.
Nevertheless, the campaign has shown that Mr Hewson is on the same
wavelength as much of the electorate, giving credence to his claims that he
is more in touch with ordinary aspirations than the avowedly populist Mr
Keating.
Some of his self-confidence comes from his conviction, fed by supportive
opinion polls, that he is destined to become the first conservative prime
minister for a decade when Australians go to the polls on March 13.
But much stems from his view that Australia's faltering economy can be
restored through the same combination of hard work and ruthless attention to
detail which propelled him to the conservative leadership.
Born in Beverley Hills, an unhappily named working class suburb in
south-western Sydney, Mr Hewson emerged from the state school system to earn
a doctorate in economics at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.
He worked for the International Monetary Fund before becoming a consultant
to various merchant banks, professor of economics at the University of New
South Wales and an adviser to Mr John Howard, treasurer (finance minister)
in the conservative government defeated in 1983.
Campaign officials say he is determined to use the opportunity offered by
five weeks of constant national attention to throw off his Keating-inspired
reputation for aloofness.
Mr Hewson has always had a difficult relationship with journalists, which
has limited his ability to project a sympathetic image through the press. He
has also appeared tense on television in the past.
But the uneasiness has disappeared during the campaign, replaced by a public
demeanour which reflects more of his private ability to charm and persuade,
sometimes with unexpected humour.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Beijing fails to end HK deadlock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR LI PENG, China's prime minister, said yesterday he believed the overall
interests of Britain and China would be best served by the two sides
'sitting down and talking'.
However, the deadlock between the two countries over terms for talks on Hong
Kong's future was unbroken last night. Barring a last-minute agreement on
talks, Governor Chris Patten will today tell the Legislative Council
(LegCo), Hong Kong's law making body, that his administration's patience
with China has virtually run out. He is also expected to indicate that his
democracy legislation will be gazetted next week if Beijing has not agreed
to talks by then.
Mr Li, meeting a delegation from Hong Kong's General Chamber of Commerce in
Beijing, said China's conditions for talks were 'respect' for the 1984
Sino-British Joint Declaration, 'convergence' with the Basic Law, and the
other 'understandings and agreements' reached between the UK and China in
the past. He did not call on Governor Patten to withdraw his blueprint for
political reform. These conditions have always been acceptable to the UK.
Mr Patten's planned statement to LegCo today is designed to regain support
among his increasingly restive supporters. He will insist on the right of
Hong Kong to participate in Anglo-Chinese talks on the colony's political
future. He will also reaffirm his and the British government's view that
LegCo has the constitutional authority to take the final decision on any
Anglo-Chinese agreement.
Talks about talks, which are under way in Beijing, have centred on these two
issues, with China indicating that it does not want to recognise Hong Kong
officials present at talks, and that the UK should agree to implement
whatever is agreed. Mr Patten is adamant that negotiations cannot be
conducted if the Chinese will not give way on these two issues. The governor
is under growing pressure to push ahead with political reform.
More than a tenth of the 400,000 people who have left Hong Kong in recent
years have returned, according to a Hong Kong government report published
yesterday.

FT  05 MAR 93 / LDP considers income tax cut
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S governing Liberal Democratic party yesterday yielded to opposition
demands that it consider an income tax cut as a condition for support on the
1993 budget.
The LDP and the three main opposition parties have been at loggerheads for
almost a week over opposition demands for a Y4,260bn (Pounds 25bn) tax cut
to stimulate the flagging economy. LDP leaders last night agreed to study
opposition proposals while drawing up plans for a special package to
stimulate the economy.
The government is coming under mounting pressure from business to take
further measures to provide an economic boost.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Generals stay in line for Yeltsin: Moscow's plan for peace
at home
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, insisted this week that
the military would not become involved in politics. But the definition of
'involved' is, in today's Russia, a flexible one.
The Russian armed forces are undergoing such colossal change that some
political unrest within their ranks is inevitable. The question is the scale
and the danger of that unrest.
First, it is well attested - by reporters and editors on the daily Izvestia
 -that at the end of a meeting of the Russian security council on Wednesday,
President Boris Yeltsin was told by a group of senior commanders that he
should take resolute measures to end the political crisis.
The implication - though not spelled out, either then or subsequently - is
that the army would be on the president's side if presidential rule were
established.
Mr Yuri Skokov, secretary of the security council, sidestepped questions
about Izvestia's report from MPs yesterday, saying the council had discussed
military and foreign policies, and that any other reports should be taken up
with Izvestia. Gen Grachev, appointed by Mr Yeltsin after the former's part
in defending the White House during the August 1991 putsch, is himself under
attack from discontented officers.
Many of them demonstrated in Moscow last week, and demanded his resignation,
as well as that of Mr Yeltsin. There has been no announcement that officers
who took part in the rally - and were filmed doing so, in their uniforms -
have been disciplined.
Gen Grachev was also constrained yesterday to deny charges from some MPs
that corruption and theft among his troops were on the increase.
However, the evidence is that he is struggling to contain just such
elements: a number of generals have been charged with corruption, and he has
threatened to sack senior commanders of the Pacific Fleet for failing to
deliver food and other supplies to conscripts - resulting in actual deaths
from hunger and widespread malnutrition.
Captain Victor Cherepkov, head of the official investigation into conditions
in the Pacific Fleet, told the Russian Information Agency yesterday that
'disgraceful outrages' had occurred and that 'never was battle-readiness in
the Fleet as low as it is now'. Capt Cherepkov blamed the 'top brass' - the
implication being that they had been profiteering from the theft of their
sailors' rations.
However, as Gen Grachev is defensive at home, he is expansionist abroad  -
or at least in the neighbouring former Soviet states, which Russian
commanders clearly do not really consider to be abroad.
He recently visited the Abkhazian region of Georgia - where Abkhazian
separatists are locked in conflict with Georgian forces, the former
allegedly enjoying the support of Russian units - without an invitation from
the Georgian government.
Before he did so, he said that Russian troops would stay in the area to
safeguard access to the Black Sea. Russian troops also remain stationed in
the TransDnestr area of Moldova, in the Baltics and throughout Central Asia.
The Black Sea fleet, based in Sevastopol in the Ukrainian region of Crimea,
is under uneasy joint Russian-Ukrainian command: while Russia actually
drafts troops from Belarus, Kazakhstan and the other Central Asian states to
make up for the lack of enthusiasm among its own pool of conscripts.
President Yeltsin yesterday told Mr Mauno Koivisto, the Finnish president,
that Russia would extend its security coverage only to those states which
wished it.
This a 'clarification' of remarks he made at the weekend in which he
appeared to be asking for international agencies to give him a free had in
quelling conflict throughout the former Soviet Union (which he is, in
effect, doing anyway).
It is clear, however, that Mr Yeltsin is willing to support his generals'
desire to keep presences in as many former Soviet states as possible: in
return for this, they are likely to feel he is worthy of their continuing
support.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Think-tank operator seeks a refill of ideas: The task facing
OECD chief economist Kumiharu Shigehara as he tries to restore the body's
credibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kumiharu Shigehara, who took over last April as chief economist at the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is trying to restore
the international think-tank's dented image in economic analysis.
The OECD's credibility has recently taken a battering. It under-estimated
the seriousness of the global economic downturn, and gave no public warning
of the crisis that hit the European exchange rate mechanism last year.
As the world's economies languish, Mr Shigehara has great opportunities to
make his mark. Today and tomorrow, he discusses the poor growth prospects in
Japan and Europe with an OECD committee of officials from 10 nations which
meets quarterly to review economic trends.
Mr Shigehara, a gangling 54-year-old who heads a team of 80 economists at
the OECD's Paris headquarters, goes some way to acknowledge criticism that
the OECD has turned into an expensive talking shop, doing little more than
turn out rehashed versions of the nostrums presented to it by member
governments.
He says he would like to see the OECD devote less time to describing
economic events and production of numerical economic forecasts. Instead,
there should be greater analysis of the trade-offs between different policy
objectives, and the problems of implementing desired policies such as
reforms of labour markets and cuts in government debts.
Current methods of producing economic forecasts are 'very primitive', he
says. Mr Shigehara believes the OECD might do better to devise a range of
forecasts, based on analysing different eventualities instead of devising
central projections which will almost certainly turn out wrong.
Mr Shigehara's ideas about economic practicalities evolved in the two
decades he spent in high-level jobs at the OECD and the Bank of Japan, where
he was chief economist.
A lifestyle that has meant switching between Paris and Tokyo every three or
four years since 1970 has given him a good grasp of the intricacies of
international deal-making in areas such as monetary policy and exchange rate
targeting.
It has also provided - besides an almost unnerving fluency in English and
French and a lack of formality which belies his nationality - a good
relationship with many top officials in the policy making world. One former
economist at a continental European central bank says of Mr Shigehara: 'He's
an outstanding person, although he can be a little self-assertive.'
According to another person who knows him, Mr Shigehara has at times at the
OECD irritated colleagues by wanting to impose fixed points of view. A more
approving comment comes from Professor Charles Goodhart, a former Bank of
England official now at the London School of Economics, who says Mr
Shigehara is 'highly approachable and personable, a scrutable Japanese'.
On the technicalities of forecasting, the OECD's chief economist likes the
UK Treasury's approach of recruiting part-time, private-sector advisers to
help on projections. This, he believes, could act as a check against over
optimistic government projections.
He indicates that the method might be appropriate for the OECD, even though
he says he is unsure of who could fill the posts.
Mr Shigehara is particularly keen that economists spend more time talking to
politicians to learn about putting economic ideas into practice.
'It's easy enough to write the beautiful language of economic commentaries.
What's hard is the implementation,' he says.
On ideas about how countries should shift structurally - perhaps to move
workers away from declining manufacturing sectors into high-growth services
 -he suggests that the west might learn from Japan's approach in the 1970s
and 1980s.
He says that because of Japan's lack of status as a world power, hardly
anyone in the country thought the government could protect them from the
effects of the 'economic shocks' of this era, including the quadrupling in
oil prices and the sharply rising yen, through policy measures such as trade
restrictions.
'As a result people just learned to accept a series of shifts from one kind
of industry to another,' he says.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Russian ministers differ on energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARP differences have emerged among Russian ministers on funding for the
energy industries and on privatisation, according to reports of yesterday's
cabinet meeting by the Interfax news agency.
A draft decree on the oil and gas industries, freeing them from the
obligation to sell 50 per cent of their hard currency to the state and from
customs tariffs, was struck off the agenda after objections that it was too
'soft' on the oil companies and contradicted earlier decisions to offer
credits and benefits to companies only in return for specific programmes.
At the same time, the demand from Mr Yuri Shafranik, energy minister, for
extra money above the Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.05bn) set aside in 1993 for
production equipment was turned over to a subcommittee. Mr Shafranik argues
that the oil sector needs at least Dollars 4.5bn a year just to maintain its
depressed output levels.
A resolution to give all Russian citizens the right to use vouchers to buy
shares in companies being privatised prompted objections from several
ministers to the privatisation programme. Mr Georgy Khizha, a deputy prime
minister, said that 'state structures' should run the privatised companies:
while Mr Victor Yefimov, the transport minister, said he could not guarantee
the safety levels of privatised transport enterprises.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINIAN officials yesterday rejected Russian claims that Ukraine was
unable to guarantee the safety of the nuclear missiles on its territory and
accused Russia of using them as part of a wider effort to re-establish its
hegemony in the region.
'We are witnessing an effort to return to the old division of the world into
two blocs controlled by two super-powers,' said Mr Boris Tarasiuk, Ukrainian
deputy foreign minister.
In a reference to the expansionist drive which built up the Russian empire
in the 17th century, Mr Tarasiuk said that Moscow was pursuing 'a new
gathering of the lands, a renewal of the federation, or of the Russian
Empire'.
Mr Tarasiuk said that Russia's newly aggressive stance, most apparent in
President Boris Yeltsin's weekend call for Russia to be given a free hand to
police the former Soviet Union, presented the west with an historic choice.
'The question right now is whether the countries of the world will support
the new world order and will respect international law or whether they will
give in to the temptation to view might as right,' Mr Tarasiuk said.
He warned that recent Russian allegations that Ukraine is unable to
guarantee the safety of the nuclear weapons located on its territory were
just one element in a wider range of issues which 'taken together constitute
a dangerous tendency in Russian policy toward Ukraine.'
Mr Tarasiuk said that recent Russian claims to Sevastopol and the Black Sea
Fleet and threats to cut off gas supplies to Ukraine were part of the same
wider policy.
Russian claims that Ukraine was preventing Russian technicians from
servicing the nuclear weapons in Ukraine and consequently creating a safety
hazard were false, Mr Tarasiuk said.

POLAND'S trade performance was far worse last year than originally thought,
according to preliminary figures released by the Foreign Trade Ministry,
Christopher Bobinski writes from Warsaw.
The new customs data reveal that Poland ran up a Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds
1.76bn) deficit last year, while payments figures collated by the NBP, the
central bank, had earlier reported a Dollars 512m trade payments surplus.
The new figures also show a Dollars 1.4bn deficit in Poland's trade with the
European Community, strengthening Warsaw's argument for greater EC access.
Mr Andrzej Byrt, a deputy foreign trade minister, said Poland last year
exported goods worth Dollars 12.9bn and purchased Dollars 15.5bn worth
abroad.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Rocard faces defeat at hands of a local hero: A leading
Socialist's travails
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PIERRE Cardo makes a positive virtue out of the fact that he has no
exciting views on national issues - but he has become a kind of national
issue himself.
For the latest polls predict that this 43-year-old Peugeot personnel
manager, carrying the joint opposition colours of the Union pour la France
(UPF), will deny Mr Michel Rocard, the Socialists' former prime minister and
future presidential standard-bearer, re-election to his suburban Paris seat
in three weeks.
Defeat would not stop him running for the Elysee in 1995, says an undaunted
Mr Rocard. But it would certainly bring him down to earth after his call
last month for a 'big bang' to create a new centre-left movement.
Scenting welcome trouble for a future opponent, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
the ex-president who wants to regain the Elysee, was in Andresy this week to
boost Mr Cardo's cause.
Among the 12 other candidates contesting Mr Rocard's seat are two
environmental candidates, the strongest of whom is Mrs Monique Le Saux, who
was once a parliamentary assistant to the former premier. If in the first
round on March 21 she wins 12.5 per cent of the vote - the minimum necessary
to go on to contest second round on the March 28 - and if she does not
explicitly pass her support to Mr Rocard, the latter is probably sunk.
Such a three-way fight would give the Socialist leader only 36 per cent
against 47 per cent for Mr Cardo, an opinion poll forecast this week.
At a time of popular disillusion with national politicians, Mr Cardo is
banking on his image as un homme du terrain - virtually the only view he
expresses on a broader issue is to repeat the opposition of Mr Jacques
Calvet, the head of Peugeot, to Japanese car imports. As mayor of
Chanteloup-les-Vignes, once an economic blackspot, he portrays himself as
rooted in the constituency's humdrum problems of jobs, crime and pollution.
Re-establishing his local credentials is much harder for Mr Rocard, as he
found even when addressing Socialist loyalists a couple of miles away from
Mr Giscard d'Estaing's simultaneous rally in Andresy on Wednesday night.
He vaunts a government promise to scrap the plan for a highway which would
have split the constituency. Mr Cardo, for his part, believes this is
Socialist temporising to save Mr Rocard's electoral skin. 'After the
election, the (highway) battle will continue,' the opposition candidate
says.
The quick-witted Socialist fields questions on some local issues well,
displaying considerable knowledge about Seine barge operators whose problems
have had the personal attention of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, the National Front
leader, in recent days. But on other questions he is passed notes by aides.
The peculiar French system has pluses and minuses for Mr Rocard in this
race. It has allowed him to keep, even as prime minister in 1988-91, a
valuable local root in the post of mayor of Conflans-Sainte-Honorine.
But even though he has won successive elections to this parliamentary seat
of Yvelines since 1978, he has rarely worked as a deputy for it. French
ministers have to hand their National Assembly seats to their elected
'suppleants' or substitutes, who inevitably then become better known on the
ground.
The constituency - part industry, part dormitory for commuters to Paris's
service sector, part agriculture - is not natural Socialist territory. In a
sense, that is a blessing for Mr Rocard. Average unemployment is just above
6 per cent, compared with the 10.5 per cent national level.
But Mr Rocard knows jobs are the national preoccupation, and at his Andresy
rally he pounds away at the 'new thinking' around which he wants to group
the centre-left.
One element of this is work-sharing, which Mr Rocard detects as a key
emerging theme of the campaign. 'Instead of having 10 per cent of the
workforce permanently out of a job, why not let everyone take 10 per cent
off the time of their overall working life?' he says. 'The result in
national output would be the same.'
But people would have to accept less pay for less work, he insists.
Work-sharing cannot be legislated, but must be negotiated by sector and by
company. Employers and unions could also negotiate a solution to the state
pension scheme's mess, he suggests.
Mr Cardo, on the other hand, counts on voters preferring his practical
record of reducing unemployment in Chanteloup from 25 to 15 per cent over
the past eight years.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Another 4,500 steel jobs to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S largest steelmaker, Thyssen Stahl, yesterday announced plans to
cut 4,500 jobs in four steel plants, in a rationalisation of its output of
girders, bars and semi-finished products.
The news was announced as 20,000 workers in the rival Krupp-Hoesch group
staged a 24-hour strike to protest at the likely closure of two plants
making special steels, and an entire integrated steelworks.
Blaming a substantial overcapacity in the European steel industry for all
so-called long products, Thyssen announced it was abandoning production of
beams and girders at its Bruckhausen plant, closing a combined steel rod and
steel wire production line at Krefeld, and shutting down output of special
steel products at the Witten plant.
A total of 4,500 jobs would go, out of 7,000 redundancies which the company
is planning in coming months.
Thyssen has pressed ahead with the plan, in spite of parallel talks with
Krupp-Hoesch and Saarstahl over greater specialisation in the overall
production of long products, such as girders, reinforcing steel and wire
rods, where European overcapacity is greatest.
Earlier, Krupp-Hoesch announced the probable closure of its long products
plants at Siegen and Hagen, with the loss of 4,000 jobs. The company is also
deciding whether to close an integrated steelworks either at
Duisburg-Rheinhausen, or at Dortmund.
Mr Gerhard Cromme, the chief executive of the Krupp-Hoesch group, was booed
by striking workers yesterday when he said redundancies were inevitable.
However Mr Jurgen Harnisch, head of Krupp Stahl, said on Wednesday it might
be possible to save 1,500 of the jobs at Siegen and Hagen by setting up an
independent special steels company: all the products at the plants are
high-value special steels.
All the plants affected by the Thyssen and Krupp closures are in the heart
of Germany's Ruhrgebiet industrial area, where labour militancy is now
running high.
The German steel industry federation estimates that 35,000 to 40,000 jobs
will be lost in the rationalisation process, 10,000 of them in east Germany.
The cuts are going ahead in advance of any final agreement in Brussels on a
steel industry rationalisation plan, which would require capacity cuts
across the Community.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Bosnia's warring parties face toughest hurdle: Negotiations
are still failing to produce a long-sought breakthrough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE signature by Mr Alija Izetbegovic, Bosnia's Moslem President, of the
military chapter of the international mediators' proposed peace settlement
for Bosnia-Hercegovina is the first evidence of progress for a month in the
New York negotiations. But it is hardly the breakthrough the world has been
waiting for so long and so anxiously.
Though all the warring parties - Serbs, Moslems and Croats - have now signed
two sections of the three-part agreement: the constitutional framework and
the ceasefire arrangements - they stand or fall together and the most
difficult hurdle has yet to be overcome. That consists of the plan to divide
the country into 10 largely self-governing provinces, with a central
government responsible mainly for foreign relations, an important provision
given Bosnian Serb ambitions to join a Greater Serbia.
Given the latest attempts by the Serbs to clear the Moslem population out of
certain regions of eastern Bosnia - allocated mainly to the Moslems on the
map tabled by the mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen - the prospects
for an early agreement on the map must be considered slim.
Mr Izetbegovic has refused to hold any face-to-face meetings with Mr Radovan
Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, as long as the Serbs continue their
military offensive and campaign of forcing the Moslems out of their homes
and villages. Mr Izetbegovic was due to leave New York last night, leaving
his foreign minister to lead the Moslem delegation. It remains to be seen
whether he can be persuaded to change his mind, following the pressing
appeals of the UN Security Council and the mediators.
It is nevertheless significant that he should have signed the military
agreement at this particularly tense juncture of the fighting in eastern
Bosnia, when an even less co-operative attitude on his part could have been
expected. The Moslems were on the verge of signing together with the Serbs
and Croats in January, even before the negotiations moved from Geneva to New
York. But they held back pending the fulfilment of a list of frequently
changing conditions, the most constant element of which was a water-tight
system of international control of heavy weapons, which would deprive the
Serbs of the means to resume hostilities.
The Vance-Owen plan spoke only of UN monitoring of heavy weapons, a promise
which was understandably not taken too seriously by Mr Izetbegovic, given
the international organisation's poor record in this field. General Satish
Nambiar, the outgoing UN commander in the former Yugoslavia, is now reported
to have given an undertaking that the heavy weapons will be physically
controlled by the UN, even though it does not yet have the necessary means
to do so.
What really appears to have persuaded Mr Izetbegovic to endorse the
agreement is the new direct US involvement in the peace talks, previously
the sole responsibility of the UN and European Community mediators, Mr Vance
and Lord Owen. The parachuting of relief supplies by the US to the people of
eastern Bosnia may not have been the outstanding success that it was
intended to be and certainly fell short of Moslem expectations of military
intervention. But Washington's promise that it would contribute a
substantial number of troops to the 40,000 to 60,000-strong international
force which will be required to enforce a peace settlement in Bosnia,
appears to be a guarantee that the control of heavy weapons will be more
effective this time round.
Now that Mr Izetbegovic has joined the other parties in endorsing the
military agreement and has been seen to adopt a more constructive attitude
towards the peace plan, the mediators are expected to switch pressure to the
Serbs.
With the full backing of the US and the Security Council, which has severely
condemned the latest Serb offensive in eastern Bosnia, Mr Vance and Lord
Owen will attempt to push the Serbs into making the relatively small
provincial border adjustments which would make the proposed map more
palatable to the Moslems. To achieve this, they are counting on the support
of Russia which, like the US, has appointed its own special representative
to the talks.
There may still be a long way to go before a full agreement is reached, but
the mediators' tactics of progressively isolating the chief culprits of the
Bosnian imbroglio is at last beginning to bear fruit.
The military agreement provides for the implementation of a ceasefire within
72 hours from the time of the conclusion of the peace settlement.
Its main provisions, apart from a cessation of hostilities, include the
withdrawal of all forces and heavy weapons to designated provinces and
locations according to a 45-day timetable. UN forces will monitor and, it
appears from the latest undertakings given by General Nambiar, physically
control all heavy weapons.
Sarajevo will be demilitarised and so-called 'blue routes', to be patrolled
by UN forces, will be established to ensure the freedom of movement of
civilians, commercial goods and humanitarian aid to and from the city.
The constitutional framework for Bosnia-Hercegovina, endorsed by all the
parties, provides for a unified, but decentralised state, with most
governmental functions carried out by its 10 provinces.
The provinces, however, may not enter into agreements with foreign states or
with international organisations.
The constitution will recognise three 'constituent peoples' (Moslems, Serbs,
Croats), as well as a group of 'others'.
The provinces and central government shall have democratically elected
legislatures and chief executives and an independent judiciary. The
presidency shall be composed of three elected representatives, each of the
three constituent peoples. Bosnia-Hercegovina is to be progressively
demilitarised under UN/EC supervision and the constitution will provide for
'the highest level' of internationally recognised human rights.

FT  05 MAR 93 / German deal raising petrol tax boosts 'solidarity pact'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOPES for a deal between the German government, the opposition and the 16
federal states on a multi-billion D-Mark 'solidarity pact' to finance German
unification increased yesterday, after the ruling coalition agreed on a
sharp rise in oil and petrol taxes.
The move is seen as the first step in an inevitable double increase in
taxation next year, which Chancellor Helmut Kohl will be forced to concede
to gain agreement on the pact.
Leading negotiators for the 16 German Lander, who will sit down to thrash
out a deal with the government on March 11 and 12, are convinced that only
the early reintroduction of a 'solidarity surcharge' on income tax will
bridge the financing gap over the next two years.
Agreement by leaders of the three parties in the ruling coalition on a
13-pfennig-per-litre increase in oil and petrol taxes - a 13 per cent
increase in the tax on leaded petrol and nearly 24 per cent on the tax on
diesel - is officially intended to finance the debt servicing costs of the
German railway system.
It was immediately described by the opposition as a backdoor tax increase,
in contradiction to the insistence by Mr Kohl that he will not raise the tax
burden before 1995.
The precise terms of the oil and petrol tax were placed in some doubt last
night after a meeting of MPs from Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic Union (CDU)
and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU). They
decided that increasing oil and petrol taxes was not enough and there should
also be a motorway fee on cars and trucks from January 1 next year.
The CDU parliamentary chairman, Mr Wolfgang Schauble, said that the oil and
petrol tax rise could be less than had been proposed if it could be coupled
with a motorway fee.
He described the MPs' decision as very reasonable and said it did not
conflict with the aims of the coalition leaders.
However, there has already been a public outcry in Germany at suggestions
the Bonn government might introduce an autobahn vignette, an annual or
monthly sticker that motorists would have to buy and display on their
vehicles.
Supporters of motorway fees say they are essential to make foreigners pay
towards the upkeep of motorways. Foreigners can avoid higher petrol tax by
filling up their tanks abroad.
Motoring organisations said a tax rise could damage the German car industry,
already suffering from the effects of recession, and cost jobs.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Matra to challenge minivan ruling in court
</HEADLINE>

   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MATRA HACHETTE, the French transport and telecoms group, is mounting a court
challenge to the European Commission's decision approving the Volkswagen and
Ford minivan joint venture.
Matra, which developed the Espace minivan with Renault in the 1980s, also
promised yesterday to continue fighting the Commission's 'unfair' grant of
Ecu750m (Pounds 619.5m) in regional and social aid to the car manufacturers'
new minivan plant in Portugal.
Mr Yves Sabouret, Matra director in charge of EC affairs, said yesterday:
'Matra will go on using all the means at its disposal to question decisions
which obviously contradict all principles of industrial efficiency and
social justice (in the Community)."
Mr Sabouret said EC support for the VW/Ford plant at Setubal would create
dangerous overcapacity in European production of minivans - 'the only
healthy, balanced market in the EC car industry'.
Matra said the Renault Espace was still the market leader in Europe,
accounting for 65,000 of the 100,000 minivans sold in 1992.
But Mr Frederic d'Allest, Matra managing director responsible for cars, said
analysts had estimated that with the help of EC funding VW/Ford could grab
40 or 50 per cent of the growing market within a year of opening in 1995.
The case against last December's competition decision will be heard by the
European Court's lower chamber, the Court of First Instance. Matra is
already challenging the July grant of Ecu750m of EC development and training
subsidies in the main European Court, and is expecting a preliminary opinion
on the case by the end of April. The Commission exempted the VW/Ford joint
venture from competition rules just before Christmas until the end of 2004,
subject to certain conditions.
Among the reasons given for incentives was that the market was dominated by
a single supplier - Matra/Renault - and that co-operation would have
'extremely positive effects on infrastructure and employment in one of the
poorest regions in the Community'.
But Matra claimed yesterday that the VW/Ford venture fulfilled none of the
criteria for exemption from the rules. Ford said it had been expecting a
court challenge and believed the Commission had acted properly.
A spokesman for Mr Karel Van Miert, who took over as EC competition
commissioner in January, refused to comment the case.

UNITED NATIONS officials yesterday announced provisional agreement to enter
Cerska, the fallen Moslem stronghold in eastern Bosnia, to check reports
that hundreds of people were killed and 1,500 wounded after Serbs overran
the enclave, report Laura Silber in Belgrade and Michael Littlejohns in New
York.
In meetings with the Bosnian Serb army, Gen Philippe Morillon, head of the
UN force, called for immediate UN access to the region and creation of a
24-hour UN-monitored corridor for civilians from Zepa, Cerska and Srebrenica
to move unmolested.
Meanwhile, the status of the military disengagement accord between Bosnia's
warring factions apppeared in doubt last night, as the Serbian side differed
with Moslems in interpreting the document.
Mr Karadzic insisted that, in signing the accord, all he accepted was UN
monitoring of withdrawal of heavy weapons. Bosnia's Moslem President Alija
Izetbegovic, however, was induced to sign on Wednesday on the understanding
that UN forces would take control of the weapons. Gen Satish Nambiar, who
retired this week as UN commander, offered the compromise to break an
impasse in the peace talks. But Mr Karadzic made it plain this was not what
the Serbs had agreed to.
Casting further doubt on the talks, Mr Izetbegovic and Mr Karadzic both
announced plans to leave New York today, ignoring a Security Council call to
remain in the city to 'reach quickly a fair and workable settlement'. A UN
spokesman said, almost in desperation: 'Where do we go fron here?' Talks
could be resumed in Geneva, Paris or some other city where it might be
possible to put pressure on the warring factions more successfully than in
New York.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Craxi immunity decision put off amid fresh allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian parliament yesterday decided to postpone until Tuesday a final
hearing on whether to waive immunity from prosecution for Mr Bettino Craxi,
the former Socialist leader, who faces corruption charges.
The hearing began on Tuesday and was due to last two days. But proceedings
have been delayed following new allegations by Mr Claudio Martelli, the
ex-justice minister and former close colleague of Mr Craxi.
Milan magistrates have asked parliament to waive immunity for Mr Craxi
citing his alleged illicit receipt of L36bn (Pounds 16m) in funds for the
party. Mr Craxi is the most prominent political figure to have been caught
up in Italy's ever-spreading corruption scandals.
The new allegations by Mr Martelli contain statements that Mr Craxi was
personally involved in the receipt of funds paid into a secret Swiss bank
account. The funds were allegedly paid by the late Mr Roberto Calvi, the
head of the Banco Ambrosiano, which collapsed in 1982, and related to the
Socialist party's assistance in organising loans from ENI, the state oil
company, to help the ailing bank.
It was not clear yesterday whether the delay in parliament's decision was
solely related to these fresh allegations. The government is also drawing up
legislation for a political solution to the judicial problems raised by
prosecuting scores of politicians, businessmen and officials on corruption
charges, largely related to illicit financing of the political parties. The
cabinet could agree on such proposals at a meeting today.
Meanwhile, the work of the parliamentary commission drawing up proposals for
constitutional change is likely to be delayed pending the choice of a
successor to Mr Ciriaco de Mita, who resigned this week as commission
president. Mr de Mita, a former Christian Democrat premier, resigned after
his brother was arrested on fraud charges.

A MAN described as a Moslem fundamentalist was charged last night over the
bombing of New York's World Trade Centre last week.
The charge against Mohammed Salameh, 26, was made at a Manhattan district
court. Earlier officials said he was of Middle East origin, but his
citizenship was not disclosed.
The authorities indicated that other suspects were being sought. At a news
conference in Washington the acting US attorney general, Mr Stuart Gerson,
said: 'We're interested in more than the single individual who has been
apprehended.'
Earlier, authorities said they had identified a van rented from Jersey City,
New Jersey, as the possible vehicle used in the attack. Although the van was
blown up, authorities were able to trace it through a number on the chassis.
Police said that a man had rented a van in Jersey City and reported it
stolen on the day of the blast. He was arrested when he went to get his
deposit back from the rental company.
Unconfirmed television reports said the arrested man was a member of a
Moslem fundamentalist group with links to a mosque in New Jersey. The
reports said the Federal Bureau of Investigation was executing search
warrants in New Jersey and Brooklyn.
New York TV station WNBC said the suspect was connected with a Moslem group
linked to the killing of Meir Kahane, a radical rabbi who was assassinated
in New York in 1990. However, the FBI and New York police refused to
comment.
Last Friday's explosion at the complex killed five people and injured more
than 1,000. More than 50 phone calls were received by the authorities from
persons or groups claiming to have carried it out. Speculation has ranged
from Middle East Arab groups to factions embroiled in the Bosnian conflict.
However, Mr Gerson refused to comment on all such reports: 'We are most
concerned about a thorough, complete investigation,' he said.
The cost of lost business has been put at Dollars 800m (Pounds 550m) in the
first week alone. The 110-storey twin towers, which house hundreds of
financial firms and 55,000 people, are expected to remain closed until next
month.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Bundesbank ignores appeals and leaves rates unchanged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank yesterday ignored foreign and domestic appeals for help to
escape recession and left its important short-term interest rates unchanged.
Despite more gloomy economic news and complaints from Germany's 16 regional
economics ministers, the central bank council decided it was too soon for
more cuts.
The decision not to ease policy surprised some foreign exchange dealers, and
the D-Mark made small gains against European currencies. The French franc
fell below FFr3.40 to the D-Mark at one stage yesterday, closing in London
at FFr3.398.
A month ago the Bundesbank cut the discount and Lombard rates to 8 per cent
and 9 per cent respectively after new turbulence in the European exchange
rate mechanism put the Danish krone under pressure.
In the absence of similar pressures this time the council reverted to its
usual caution. It may have been influenced partly by a government
announcement of an increase in oil and petrol taxes, notionally to fund the
restructuring of the railways.
Inflation, currently 4.2 per cent, remains the bank's principal concern. Its
medium-term aim of bringing the rate of price increases down to 2 per cent,
aided by several modest wage agreements this year, is now being hampered by
government policy.
Import prices, which have fallen steadily in the last few months, are now
2.2 per cent lower than a year ago, the statistics office reported
yesterday.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Major ends knighthoods on the nod
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOMINATING a neighbour for a knighthood could become a new British pastime -
and a headache for Whitehall officials - after proposals for reforming the
honours system were announced yesterday by Mr John Major.
The prime minister's call for candidates for OBEs, Dames or other
decorations could provoke a flood of applications to Downing Street. Forms
are available on request.
A spokesman confirmed last night that there were no plans for the
eight-strong staff who administer the honours to be increased, 'except
perhaps another typist'.
Mr Major told MPs that in future he wanted honours on merit for exceptional
achievement or services, 'over and above what normally might be expected'
and an end to automatic honours for public servants reaching certain ranks.
Class divisions will be removed by phasing out the British Empire Medal,
usually for less skilled workers, and awarding instead the Member of the
British Empire medal, currently reserved for professionals. In the services,
awarding 'crosses' for officers and 'medals' for others will end.
Mr Major wants the honours process to be more open, saying: 'It is, at
present, too haphazard'.
Among those disappointed will be permanent secretaries and lieutenant
generals who until now have been given a knighthood on the nod.
Hereditary peerages will stop, while automatic awards for High Court judges
on appointment will continue. However, along with less-automatic
distinctions for journalists, these may end in the future, Mr Major hinted.
The armies of volunteer workers, unnoticed public servants and private
sector workers outside London who the prime minister wants to reward will be
delighted. Relieved Tory MPs were assured that political knighthoods would
continue.
The four-page nomination form imposes no restrictions on who can nominate
whom, warning only that, 'because of the competition for honours it is not
fair to raise nominees' expectations in case they are disappointed'.
Factual details and other letters of support are requested, if possible, but
not if it means breaking confidentiality.
About 1,000 honours are awarded in each of the New Year and Queen's Birthday
lists. But Britain's predilection for gift offers and audience participation
means the number of nominations is likely to be far higher. The FT receives
about 1,000 entries for a Saturday prize crossword; a television programme
such as the BBC's 'Watchdog' consumer affairs magazine receives 4,000
letters a week.
Downing Street appears to have few plans for changing the current system of
scrutinising names via selection committees. Final recommendations to the
Queen are taken ultimately by the prime minister.
Forms are available from The Nominations Unit, Honours Secretariat, 10
Downing Street, London SW1A 2AA. Fax no: 071 210 5046. Closing date for the
1994 New Year's honours list is June 1.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Barclays records Pounds 242m loss and halves dividend: Bank
announces first pre-tax deficit and makes Pounds 2.5bn provision against bad
debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK, the UK's largest high street bank, yesterday announced its
first pre-tax loss - a deficit of Pounds 242m. It halved its final dividend
and posted the largest provision against bad debts yet allocated by a
British bank.
About Pounds 1.96bn of the Pounds 2.5bn provision was on specific loans in
the UK. Loans to property and construction companies, many made before the
property slump at the end of the 1980s, accounted for 40 per cent of the UK
provisions.
Mr Andrew Buxton, the bank's chairman and chief executive, said his salary
was at least 10 per cent lower than that of Sir John Quinton, his
predecessor. 'The rate for the job has fallen significantly,' he said.
Mr Buxton, who was managing director of the bank under Sir John during the
late 1980s when many lending decisions were made, declined to say when he
would split the two roles as he has promised to do after criticism from
shareholders.
The bank's shares fell by 10.5 per cent to 392p on the day's trading after
the surprise announcement of the cut in the final dividend. Most brokers had
been anticipating lower losses of up to Pounds 100m and the dividend to be
maintained.
Mr Buxton said the 'very disappointing' result and the uncertain outlook for
the coming year meant the bank felt it might not be able to re-build its
ratio of capital to assets sufficiently without cutting the dividend.
He said the bank was changing the way it handles large corporate loans to
ensure that managers who make such loans take individual responsibility. The
careers of some managers involved in poor lending in the past 'had
suffered'.
The decision by Barclays to cut its dividend was only the second time a
British bank has been forced to take such action.
Midland Bank, which was last year acquired by HSBC Holdings, cut its
dividend two years ago.
Barclays was the last of the four traditional high street banks to report
1992 profits. Its loss is one of the biggest incurred by a British clearing
bank, although Lloyds made a loss of Pounds 715m in 1989 because of Third
World debt provisions.
Mr Buxton said the executive directors had recommended a halving of the
final dividend to 6p per share because they were uncertain how far back into
profit the bank would rebound this year.
Of the Pounds 1.96bn provision against possible bad loans in the domestic
bank, Pounds 600m related to 27 single loans of more than Pounds 5m each.
They included a Pounds 240m provision on Barclays' lending to the Imry
property development company.
The bank made its loss despite a substantial increase in its operating
profitability.
Its profit before provisions rose 18 per cent to Pounds 2.4bn, as its UK
business widened margins on loans and increased commission and fees.
The Pounds 98m saved by the dividend cut let Barclays maintain a ratio of
its core capital to assets of 5.5 per cent compared with 5.9 per cent at the
end of 1991.
Some analysts believe the lowest ratio of which the Bank of England is
thought to approve is 5 per cent.
The bank, which disclosed that it cut staff numbers by 6,400 last year and
closed 189 branches, was criticised by unions. The Bifu financial services
union said the loss was from 'monumental incompetence over a long period'.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: US retailers' growth slackens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEADING US retailers blamed the severe winter weather, which affected many
parts of the country last month, for a slowdown in sales growth during
February.
Most of the major retail chains posted increases in 'same-store sales'
during the trading period, but the scale of the improvements was sharply
diminished from the strong advances seen in previous months.
Some comparisons were also affected by the fact that 1992 was a Leap Year,
and hence February's trading last year included an extra day.
"Sales of consumer products and home electronics were strong throughout the
month with winter storms adversely affecting sales, particularly in apparel
lines, after the holiday weekend,' said Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman of K
mart. He also noted that temperatures had been 'unseasonably mild' in
February 1992.
At Sears, Roebuck, Mr Arthur Martinez, head of the merchandise division,
said underlying sales trends remained 'encouraging'.
Sears saw a 2.2 per cent advance in domestic same-store sales during the
four weeks to February 27, while K mart posted a 1.1 per cent improvement
for the four weeks to February 24.
Wal-Mart, the largest US retailer in sales terms, saw a 6 per cent rise in
same-store sales if February 29, 1992, was excluded from the comparison.
With that day's trading same-store sales for the month were flat.
Among the department store chains, Federated Department Stores - which takes
in Bloomingdale's, Abraham &amp; Straus and The Bon Marche - posted a 1.4 per
cent increase in same-store sales for the four weeks ended February 27; J.
C. Penney managed a 4.7 per cent advance from its core department stores
over the same period; and May Department Stores a 2.7 per cent improvement.
Woolworth saw domestic same-store sales actually fall by 3.4 per cent.

FT  05 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Row fear on Scots reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Political Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CABINET ministers yesterday approved a limited package of constitutional
reforms for Scotland but are likely to face a barrage of opposition next
Tuesday when the details are announced.
Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish secretary, faces protest for not giving locally
elected representatives more say in Scottish government.
There is also concern among opposition MPs over the proposed moving of civil
service jobs from London to Scotland.
One option the prime minister and his colleagues were discussing was that
the Scottish Grand Committee - comprising all 72 Scottish MPs
 -may be given a wider remit than its at present role, which is entirely
subservient to government policy.
Yesterday's discussion was the culmination of a promise given by the prime
minister during last year's general election in the face of the Scottish
National party's demand for total separation and Labour's plans for new
regional assemblies, including a powerful Scottish parliament.
Mr Major agreed to look at various options. But he has made clear he is an
unflinching supporter of the union between Scotland and the rest of the
United Kingdom and would not contemplate any action that put it at risk.
The Labour party yesterday ordered a shake-up of its operations in the
political heartland of party leader Mr John Smith.
A Labour inquiry into the running of local parties in the Monklands area of
Lanarkshire said the district council had left itself 'open to criticism' by
the way staff were appointed.
Mr Smith is MP for Monklands East and Mr Tom Clarke, the shadow Scottish
secretary, represents Monklands West.
The inquiry team has also rewritten the standing orders of the local parties
in what appears to be a dismantling of an old-style political machine.
However the inquiry report - ordered by Labour's Scottish executive last
September - was muted in its criticism and insisted the changes were simply
an updating of antiquated local procedures.
The report said that 'those who suggest that improper actions have taken
place should put those charges in the hands of the appropriate authorities
or desist from making the allegations'.

5 per cent its long-term forecast for new aircraft deliveries in its latest
market outlook.
But despite the industry's turmoil, Boeing expects world air travel and
demand for new airliners to recover and show substantial growth by the end
of the decade.
In its annual study of the airliner market published today, Boeing forecasts
new aircraft deliveries totalling more than 1,200 jets valued at Dollars
815bn over the next 18 years. This is 5 per cent less than the Dollars 857bn
of new deliveries over the same period the Seattle-based company had
forecast last year.
The study shows that while aircraft deliveries totalling 789 jets worth
Dollars 44.3bn remained at near-record levels last year, the combination of
over-capacity, slow traffic growth and airline losses and financing
difficulties led to a 6.6 per cent drop in new orders compared with 1991.
Boeing said airlines ordered 482 aircraft worth Dollars 29.9bn last year
compared with Dollars 32bn worth of orders in 1991 and as much as Dollars
71bn worth in 1990.
All three big manufacturers - Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus - also
had cancellations and deferrals from financially strapped customers. This
has led to sharp cuts in production and employment. Boeing is cutting output
by 35 per cent and plans to shed 28,000 jobs over the next 18 months. After
declining in 1991, air travel grew by 6.9 per cent last year. However, Mr
Richard Albrecht, a Boeing executive vice-president, said much of this
growth was the result of uneconomic air fares that produced continuing
losses for many airlines.
The recovery of the commercial aircraft business will hinge on a general
improvement in the world economy and a return to profitable airline
operations. Although airlines lost more than Dollars 10bn during the last
three years, Boeing expects that larger airlines will now evolve as
integration and consolidation continues. These larger airlines will have
better control of their operations and, while the future airline market will
still be competitive, Boeing believes it will be more stable.
Air travel is expected to grow at an annual average rate of 5.4 per cent
between now and 2010, according to Boeing. This growth will be led by the
Asia-Pacific markets which are expected to account for over 40 per cent of
growth over the next 18 years.
Of the 12,000 or more new aircraft to be delivered between now and 2010,
about 30 per cent will be needed to replace older and noisier jets.
However, the rate of replacement of older jets has been slower than
expected. Only 155 aircraft were retired last year, but Boeing says more
than 750 were parked in the Arizona and California deserts at the end of
last year. Boeing expects many of these parked aircraft will never return to
service.
The average aircraft size is also expected to continue to grow over the next
18 years from an average of 176 seats in 1980 to 193 seats in 1992 and to
227 seats in 2010.
Boeing said its market share had not deteriorated in spite of changing
competition. The Seattle group took 57 per cent of orders last year while
Airbus won 29 per cent and McDonnell Douglas 11 per cent with other smaller
manufacturers accounting for the remaining 3 per cent.
Boeing's forecasts are roughly in line with those recently made by its two
competitors.
Airbus is estimating demand for 13,500 aircraft over the next 20 years while
McDonnell Douglas has forecast a total requirement for 14,000 new jets
during the same period.

GERMANY'S largest steelmaker, Thyssen Stahl, yesterday announced plans to
cut 4,500 jobs in four steel plants, in a rationalisation of its output of
girders, bars and semi-finished products.
The news was announced as 20,000 workers in the rival Krupp-Hoesch group
staged a 24-hour strike to protest at the likely closure of two plants
making special steels, and an entire integrated steelworks.
Blaming a substantial overcapacity in the European steel industry for all
so-called long products, Thyssen announced it was abandoning production of
beams and girders at its Bruckhausen plant, closing a combined steel rod and
steel wire production line at Krefeld, and shutting down output of special
steel products at the Witten plant.
A total of 4,500 jobs would go, out of 7,000 redundancies which the company
is planning in coming months.
Thyssen has pressed ahead with the plan, in spite of parallel talks with
Krupp-Hoesch and Saarstahl over greater specialisation in the overall
production of long products, such as girders, reinforcing steel and wire
rods, where European overcapacity is greatest.
Earlier, Krupp-Hoesch announced the probable closure of its long products
plants at Siegen and Hagen, with the loss of 4,000 jobs. The company is also
deciding whether to close an integrated steelworks either at
Duisburg-Rheinhausen, or at Dortmund.
Mr Gerhard Cromme, the chief executive of the Krupp-Hoesch group, was booed
by striking workers yesterday when he said redundancies were inevitable.
However Mr Jurgen Harnisch, head of Krupp Stahl, said on Wednesday it might
be possible to save 1,500 of the jobs at Siegen and Hagen by setting up an
independent special steels company: all the products at the plants are
high-value special steels.
All the plants affected by the Thyssen and Krupp closures are in the heart
of Germany's Ruhrgebiet industrial area, where labour militancy is now
running high.
The German steel industry federation estimates that 35,000 to 40,000 jobs
will be lost in the rationalisation process, 10,000 of them in east Germany.
The cuts are going ahead in advance of any final agreement in Brussels on a
steel industry rationalisation plan, which would require capacity cuts
across the Community.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Axel Springer gives up plans for
alliance in Italy

<TEXT>
AXEL SPRINGER Verlag, the German media group, and Poligrafici Editoriale,
the listed Italian newspaper concern controlled by the members of the Monti
family, have wound up their four-year attempt to create a closer alliance.
Springer has sold the 10 per cent stake it took in Poligrafici Editoriale in
June 1989, when the Italian company spent L160bn (Dollars 107m) to buy a
similar sized stake in its German counterpart. Separately, Poligrafici said
it had sold its 10 per cent stake in Springer for DM220m (Dollars 132.5m).
However, plans for closer co-operation, including an Italian language
equivalent of Springer's best-selling Bild Zeitung, never materialised.
Last year, Springer said it wanted to sell its Italian stake, but the
transaction has only took place this week.
The 10 per cent holding, worth L61.4bn, has been bought by Mediobanca, the
Milan-based merchant bank, at a price of L4,650 a share. That is appreciably
below the L5,505 at which Poligrafici shares were fixed on Tuesday, when the
deal took place.
The price represents a substantial loss, particularly in D-Mark terms, for
Springer, which bought its stake for about L70.6bn. According to Springer,
the sale followed its decision to concentrate on its traditional key
markets.
However, relations between the two companies have steadily deteriorated,
with the Italians complaining of insufficient involvement in decision making
at the German group. Last summer, Springer asked for the return of its
shares held by the Italians.
Brokers believe the Poligrafici shares bought by Mediobanca are unlikely to
be a long-term investment.
However, there remains considerable uncertainty as to where they may end up.
Banco Di Napoli, the large Italian bank which floated 20 per cent of its
ordinary shares in late 1991, has taken majority control of Isveimer, the
Naples-based public sector lending institution.
The acquisition, for a price which has not been revealed, marks a further
step in the gradual rationalisation of the Italian banking system and
erosion of divisions between different types of financial institutions.
Banco di Napoli owned over 45 per cent of Isveimer. The acquisition of a
further 6.1 per cent, lifting Banco di Napoli's stake to just over 51 per
cent, had taken place last year. This was formalised this week.
Isveimer, which is likely to keep its independence in the short term,
administers about L25,000bn (Dollars 16.8bn) in loans. Its other main
shareholder is Agensud, a state-owned body being closed down, whose stake in
Isveimer will be transferred to the Treasury.

The society has made a commitment to keep depositors informed about savings
rates, following a wave of publicity that investors with other societies had
languished in obsolete accounts. While the society said it had attracted
over 400,000 new savings customers in 1992, Mr Alistair Lyons, finance
director, estimated the commitment had cost the society Pounds 20m during
the year.

FT  05 MAR 93 / International Company News: Lower prices push SSAB to
SKr165m pre-tax loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SSAB, the Swedish steel group which was privatised last year, slumped to a
SKr165m (Dollars 21m) pre-tax loss in 1992 after a sharp drop in domestic
demand and intense competition in the west European market.
The steep fall in prices towards the end of the year meant the deficit was
deeper than the group had expected last October.
However, it suggested enhanced competitiveness, following the devaluation of
the krona, and a promised round of price rises in Europe would provide the
foundation for a return to profit in 1993. The 1992 result contrasts with a
SKr218m profit in 1991 and follows a drop in operating revenue to SKr11.87bn
from SKr13.76bn. The loss per share was SKr2.90 and the dividend was cut by
SKr1 to SKr5 per share.
Cash flow was a negative SKr124m. Lower demand and higher imports from
eastern Europe combined to put pressure on prices in the European market
while the threat of punitive import duties curtailed exports to the US.
In Sweden, recession meant trading and processing revenues in the group's
home market fell 20 per cent. SSAB said the trend of steel prices in western
Europe would be the key influence on its result this year.
Although the year had started badly, with prices down 10 per cent on their
1992 average, the group noted that many European producers were planning to
raise prices from the second quarter.
The group also believes it will benefit from its efforts to align capacity
with domestic demand and from improved margins following the depreciation of
the krona.
It also expects lower energy taxes and reduced employer's social security
contributions to have a favourable impact.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK would face a serious fall in living standards if the electorate
voted No to the Maastricht treaty in the country's second referendum, on May
18, according to a report by the Ministry of Finance.
The report's conclusions were promptly denounced by Mr Kai Lemberg, a
representative of the main anti-Maastricht organisation, the June Movement,
as being based on 'outrageous assumptions'. But Mr Mogens Lykketoft, the
finance minister, said that there was little doubt about the accuracy of the
economic predictions outlined in the report.
The report assumes that if there is a second No vote, Denmark will have to
leave the European Community and accept the same status as the Efta
countries by signing the European Economic Area agreement. This would
exclude Denmark from participation in the EC's common agricultural and
fisheries policies, force Denmark to leave the European monetary system, and
have an adverse effect on foreign direct investment in Denmark.
The impact on agriculture and fisheries would be especially serious. Exports
of agricultural and fisheries products, including industrially processed
foods, were worth about DKr62bn (Dollars 9.8bn), or 26 per cent of total
merchandise exports, in 1992.
Without access to EC markets, or EC subsidies for agricultural exports to
third countries, exports of agricultural and fisheries products could be
halved, the report claims, resulting in the loss of some 100,000 jobs in
agriculture, fisheries and the food processing industries.
When compared with likely developments if Denmark remains a member of the
Community, real disposable national income in the short-term would fall by
7-8 per cent and 150,000 jobs - about 5 per cent of total employment - would
be lost, the report concludes.
The remaining job losses would arise because Danish interest rates would be
higher than in other European countries if Denmark left the EMS and as a
result of lower investment by both foreign and domestic companies.
Initially, however, the country's balance of payments, which is in
substantial surplus at the moment, would not be seriously affected, as
imports would fall even faster than exports, the report predicts.
The Danish central bank reduced its key money market interest rate, the
repro rate, by a half point from 12.5 to 12 per cent yesterday. The step
follows the easing of speculative pressure on the Danish krone in February,
when the official discount rate was raised from 9.5 to 11.5 per cent. The
discount rate was reduced to 10.5 per cent on February 22. The central bank
used DKr16bn to support the krone in February.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUCHAREST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Romanian chamber of deputies has amended the foreign investment law to
allow foreign companies to own property in Romania and repatriate all
profits, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
The bill must be approved by the Senate before becoming law but is expected
to pass without difficulty, the Romanian Development Agency (RDA), the state
body responsible for foreign investment, said yesterday.
The amendment allows foreign investors to own property in Romania through
joint venture companies or through locally registered subsidiaries. Existing
legislation says Romanian economic agents may own real estate but does not
specify that this includes foreign investors participating in local
companies.
Confusion has arisen because the country's constitution forbids ownership of
real estate by foreigners.
Mr Florin Bonciu, the RDA's director general, said the amendment would bring
Romanian foreign investment regulations in line with those in other eastern
European countries.
He expected the bill would boost investment in Romania especially from
medium-sized companies.
Most of the Dollars 600m which has been invested in Romania to date had come
from small companies with no need to own property, or from large companies
such as Coca-Cola which are prepared to set up factories in spite of the
ambiguous legislation, he said.
Medium-sized companies did not have the resources to take such risks.
The amendment allowing 100 per cent repatriation of profits made in both
hard currency and in lei, the national currency, is not expected to make as
big an impact on investors in the short term.
Romania's acute hard currency shortages make it difficult in practical terms
for companies to change lei into convertible currencies.
Serbian harbour workers have ended an eight-day blockade of the River
Danube, the Romanian Foreign Ministry said yesterday.
Trades unions in the Serb port of Prahovo, protesting against UN sanctions,
had prevented international river traffic from reaching the Black Sea since
last Tuesday.

<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, UK foreign secretary, yesterday endorsed the view of Mr
Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, that United Nations troops
may have to use force to implement an agreement in former Yugoslavia.
However, Mr Hurd emphasised that it would be impossible to impose a military
solution in the absence of a negotiated settlement endorsed by all the
warring parties.
During his one-day visit to New York, Mr Hurd discussed the Balkans crisis
with Mr Boutros Ghali and the UN and European Community mediators trying to
complete a peace settlement.
The question, said Mr Hurd, was how to implement an accord based on the
proposals of the two mediators, Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, 'after that
agreement had been reached'.
The ideas that were taking shape after last Friday's Nato meeting were still
a long way from 'receiving detailed definition,' he added. Asked if the new
outbreak of fighting in Bosnia was a serious setback for the peacemaking
process, Mr Hurd acknowledged that it was damaging but it only made the
peace talks even more essential.
Mr Hurd welcomed yesterday's US call for an emergency session of the
Security Council. The council scheduled closed-door consultations last night
that were expected to be followed by a statement aimed at halting the
carnage in Bosnia.
Meanwhile, in a speech in Antwerp yesterday, Mr Hans van den Broek, EC
commissioner responsible for external relations, raised the prospect of the
European Community, the US and Russia using joint military force to bring an
end to the conflict.
Mr Van den Broek, formerly Dutch foreign minister, said the Yugoslav crisis
had entered a crucial phase. Military intervention might be necessary to
uphold a political settlement based on the Vance-Owen plan, or to impose a
solution from the outside. 'In both scenarios Europe will face painful
choices as to its military intervention,' said Mr Van den Broek.
'I believe that only a united front by the US, the European Community and
Russia offers a chance of forcing the warring parties to make peace.'
EC diplomats reacted cautiously to Mr Van den Broek's suggestion, pointing
out that such decisions lay with member states, rather than the European
Commission. A UK diplomat said Mr Van den Broek, a long-time hawk on
Yugoslavia, was on 'dangerous ground' if he was threatening to impose an
outside settlement. More than 50,000 troops might be needed to broker and
enforce a truce.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Russia to privatise maker of top people's limousines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ZIL, the Russian industrial conglomerate indelibly associated with the black
limousines which were the preserve of top communists in the former Soviet
Union, is to be privatised.
The government said yesterday that R1bn of nominal share capital - 1m shares
with a face value of R1,000 - will be offered for sale at 100 auction
centres across Russia.
Although Zil limousines are still used to whisk president Boris Yeltsin and
his bodyguards at high speeds through the Moscow traffic, demand has fallen
now that the new commercial elite prefer Mercedes and stretch Volvos. Zil
also produces heavy trucks of an outmoded design and refrigerators.
The cars are handmade at a rate of two or three a year, but the mode of
production guaranteed that each was unique so that parts were not
interchangeable. A company official declined to reveal the price.
The cars are still popular with well-heeled tourists. They are also bought
by smart young Russian bankers to conduct them from work to marble-floored
dachas. The armour plating and curtained seclusion of the passenger saloons,
which shielded the communist elite from terrorists and stares of the
curious, now serve the same function for the new commercial princes.
Western consulting companies which have looked at the enterprise have
concluded that any effort to transform the company into a successful and
profitable enterprise will be a mammoth task. It has between between 110,000
and 130,000 workers in 17 sites across Russia.
The biggest site is an ecological inferno located in a bend of the Moscow
river in the southern district of the capital. Requests to visit the plant
were yesterday brusquely refused on the grounds that the plant had
commercial secrets to protect.
The spread of Zil's sites, the wastefulness of its production methods and
the archaic nature of its designs lend a certain Stalinist splendour to the
company, but make it a nightmare for rationalisation and privatisation.
Perhaps in recognition of the difficulty of bringing Zil to the market, a
government official said foreign investment would be unlikely until 'a later
stage', when the various parts of the company had been broken up.
The shares offered represent 35 per cent of the share value of the company,
with 40 per cent going to the workforce and management either free or on
preferential terms and a further 25 per cent held in state hands for later
sale.
The enterprise is the first to be offered on an all-Russian basis, and
represents both an attempt to prove that organisations of this size can be
successfully sold off and a test of the nationwide system for offering
shares.

FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S strength in the stock index futures justified itself yesterday,
when the underlying stock market rose sharply ahead of today's policy
meeting at the Bundesbank, writes Terry Byland.
The equity market did not wait for the futures to open but quickly took
advantage of arbitrage opportunities later in the day.
The March contract on the FT-SE 100 Index first traded at 2,912, responding
to the overnight strength of Wall Street. It maintained the premium over
cash at about 12 points, contrasting with the 4-point discount to the fair
value calculation. Trading volume increased substantially in the March
future, which saw 15,637 contracts change hands.
At best, the contract touched 2,934, showing a 12-point premium against the
day's high for the underlying index. This premium was held at the official
close and the future made further progress in late dealings, being quoted at
2,936.
Traded options were also busier, returning total volume of 35,468 lots,
against 32,346. The greatest increase came in the FT-SE option, where
business jumped from 4,986 to 14,726 contracts. The Euro FT-SE was also
active, at 4,292 lots, with Tesco recording 2,108 contracts and Barclays,
where the market is nervous ahead of the results and dividend statement,
1,995 lots. Selling of Guinness shares was reflected in activity in traded
options.

FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Barclays nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a tumble late in the session in Barclays shares as the market grew
increasingly nervous about the possibility of a cut in the dividend when the
bank reveals preliminary figures this morning.
The stock raced up to 436p during early trading, with dealers confident that
the recent scare stories about the final dividend had been overplayed and
that the bank's figures would not be as bad as some specialists have
forecast. The most bearish observers have pencilled in losses of up to
Pounds 150m, with bad debts predicted to come out at around the Pounds 2bn
mark.
However, a flurry of late selling orders drove Barclays down to a day's low
point of 428p before steadying to finish at 433p for a net gain of a penny.
Barclays' discomfort during the late afternoon was in sharp contrast to the
strong showing of HSBC, which forged ahead to close 23 higher at 624p after
the well-received preliminary results from Midland Bank, taken over by HSBC
last year. HSBC shares were additionally helped by the good performance of
the Hong Kong market.
Lloyds, meanwhile, rose 9 to 540p and National Westminster, boosted by
switching out of Barclays, put on 8 at 443p in heavy turnover of 5.3m.
The outstanding performance of Standard Chartered shares in the run-up to
the March 10 figures continued apace, the stock ending 13 stronger at 692p,
easily the highest the shares have traded since before the big crash of
1987.
Guardian Royal Exchange surprised the market in reporting a return to
profits but, equally, disappointed some of the more optimistic analysts who
had been looking for a modest increase in the dividend.
'Many analysts questioned the logic of not increasing the dividend after
what was seen as a good profits performance,' said one specialist, who added
that GRE directors were given a rough ride by analysts during the
post-results meeting.
GRE shares, initially bid up to 194p, came off sharply as the session wore
on, closing only marginally higher at 189p. Turnover was a heavy 10m.
Commercial Union was the beneficiary of switching out of GRE, the shares
accelerating to finish 15 firmer at 623p. Refuge jumped 20 to 948p after
news of the sale of the estate agency businesses.
Glaxo was in the forefront of the market's advance, gaining 17 at 678p on
turnover of 4.3m. ICI, similarly, raced up 43 to 1233p on good volume of
3.4m.
Oil shares delivered another good performance, with US buying interest in
the majors accompanied by equally strong support from UK investors. Much of
the domestic buying interest in the sector was said to have been generated
by an uprating of the sector by SG Warburg Securities, one of the leading UK
integrated investment houses.
It was said that Warburg had shifted its stance on the oil sector from
'hold' to 'buy', citing the effect of currency movements on the sector.
Warburg was thought to have been especially bullish of prospects for the
exploration and production sector. Enterprise moved up 7 to 476p and Lasmo 3
to 185p. Of the majors, Shell, said to be Warburg's 'core holding' in the
sector, rose 8 to 578p on heavy turnover of 7m.
BP added 6 1/2 at 289p, with turnover, boosted by yet more strong support
from the US, reaching 13m shares. Specialists are convinced that US
investors now speak for around a quarter of BP's equity and that follow-on
buying from underweight UK funds could see the shares moving up to 300p in
the short term.
Speculation late in the session that Williams Holdings, which reports
figures today, was about to announce a rights issue and an acquisition left
the shares unchanged at 360p after trade of 2.1m.
Automated Security climbed 10 to 161p, reflecting increasing optimism over
prospects for the group's new TVX mini-surveillance system.
The market was cheered by the sharp increase in profits at Thomas Cowie,
which jumped 14 to 211p.
Perry Group moved in sympathy with Cowie, gaining 10 at 146p. Credit
Lyonnais Laing was said to have reduced its profits forcast in European
Motor, which receded 9 to 93p.
Relief that Cadbury-Schweppes was not the purchaser of Terry's helped its
shares firm 9 to 493p. Cadbury has for a long time been mentioned as a bid
target for Philip Morris, but analysts pointed out that the purchase of
Terry's may now rule out such a move on competition grounds.
Profit-taking in Unilever after the boost given to the stock by last week's
favourable results left it 15 off at 1208p.
A profits downgrade from Cazenove hit Allied-Lyons, sending it down 10 to
593p. The broker is now said to be predicting current-year profits of Pounds
610m, against its previous estimate of around Pounds 625m, and for the
following year Pounds 700m, against Pounds 725m.
In the rest of the sector, Guiness fell victim to fears of an increase in
taxation on drinks in both the US and UK, along with talk that a large
stake-holder wanted to sell its holding. The shares gave up 6 to 441p in
heavy trade of 6m.
Boddington was in demand ahead of today's figures, rising 6 to 216p.
Sentiment was further encouraged by talk that the company was planning to
dispose of its 19.5 per cent stake in JA Devenish, a penny easier at 273p.

British Aerospace (BAe) featured strongly. SG Warburg was said to have
cleared an overhanging line of stock but then sought to replenish its
trading books. The shares were 13 1/2 ahead at 272 1/2 p by the close.
Further buying came from agency broker Henderson Crosthwaite, a long-time
bull of the stock. Mr Brian Newman at the house predicted a sharp turnround
at the Rover cars subsidiary as well as further defence contracts. He now
believes the break-up value of the group to be in the region of 600p.
Trading volume in BAe reached 4.1m shares.

<TEXT>
The market gave approval to BICC's preliminary numbers which, although
slightly below expectations on the pre-tax profits figure, gave
encouragement to investors due to a maintained dividend.
'The numbers were clean, there were no funnies and there was evidence of a
recovery in the Australian business; all very good news for investors,' was
the view of one leading electricals specialist. He did, however, qualify the
good news by pointing out that the widely accepted slowdown in the
continental European economies would have a substantial effect on the cables
business in Europe.
BICC shares galloped ahead from the outset, outpacing the electricals index
and the wider market to close a further 21 up at 366p; turnover of 10m was
the highest single day's business since last October.

FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy fall by United Biscuits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Biscuits, which confirmed the sale of its Terry's chocolate making
subsidiary to Kraft General Foods International, failed to follow the strong
trend of the rest of the market because of disappointment that it had not
been able to secure a higher price.
The company said it was selling Terry's to the Philip Morris subsidiary for
Pounds 220m, although a number of market watchers had predicted a figure
around the Pounds 250m mark.
The stock fell heavily, giving up 13 to 379p in trade of 4.1m. As it has
outperformed the market by around 10 per cent over the past two weeks in
anticipation of the sale, some of the day's selling was put down to simple
profit-taking.
Mr Carl Short at Nomura commented: 'It is a sensible deal given United
Biscuits' desire to invest in other snacks and biscuit companies.' He was,
however, among those who advised investors to take profits following the
recent strength of the shares.

FT  04 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: New peak as overseas buyers appear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUDDEN shift towards optimism on interest rates both in Germany and the UK
drove the London stock market confidently to new all-time highs. Shares
opened strongly in response to the overnight 45-point rise in the Dow
Industrial Average, and drew further encouragement later from an optimistic
review of the domestic economy in the UK Treasury's latest monthly report.
Attention is now focused on this morning's meeting at the Bundesbank. The
appearance of a few Continental European institutional buyers in London
yesterday morning caused UK strategists to think again about prospects for a
cut in German interest rates ahead of the French elections.
At best, the market was ahead by nearly 40 points on the FT-SE 100 scale.
Gains were trimmed at mid-session, when the Bundesbank said it would not
hold a press conference after today's policy meeting, but UK shares rose
again when Wall Street, after some hesitation, turned higher in the new
session.
At the close, the FT-SE 100 Index was 36.3 points up at 2,918.6. The
previous intra-day peak of 2,900.1 was broken early but then lost again, in
spite of another strong opening in stock index futures.
Trading volume increased strongly to a Seaq total of 710.3m shares from the
573.3m recorded on Tuesday. The presence of the big institutions was
confirmed by the focus on the FT-SE 100 list; trade in non-Footsie shares
dipped to some 59 per cent of the Seaq total from the average 62 per cent of
recent sessions.
However, the FT-SE Mid 250 Index was also at a new peak of 3,077.9, a gain
of 27.9, and traders said that private investors appeared to have regained
their confidence. The previous peak of 3,051.4 on the FT-SE Mid 250 was
reached on February 8.
The re-adjustment in views on German interest rate prospects was by no means
absolute; City strategists rated the chances of a significant cut in German
rates as 'no more than 50-50'. But some analysts believed that the UK market
had turned too strongly negative on this point in the previous session.
Further gains in sterling encouraged hopes that overseas funds may now be
ready to buy UK equities.
On the domestic front, expectations of a cut in UK base rates around Budget
day benefited from some encouraging hints on the economy. Disclosure by the
Halifax Building Society, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, that sales of
new homes has risen by a fifth so far this year was later followed by the
Treasury's encouraging monetary report. This indicated that shop sales are
rising, house prices falling less sharply and overall activity improving.
The market has also been helped by the satisfactory tone of trading results
from major companies over the past fortnight.
The banking sector responded well yesterday to the report from Midland, now
part of Hongkong Banking, but a question mark still hangs over today's
trading and dividend statement from Barclays.
Traders admitted to having been caught out by the sudden rebound in the
stock market. Marketmakers had begun to move towards balanced trading books
ahead of the Budget and were short of stock. The final minutes of trading
brought some hints that a rights issue was planned for this morning.

FT  04 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow takes lead from firmer
Treasuries
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
AFTER Tuesday's sharp advance, US share prices posted modest gains
yesterday, supported by the latest rally in the bond market, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 3.51 up at 3,404.04. The Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 added 1.36 at 449.26, while the American SE composite finished
3.40 higher at 413.47. The Nasdaq composite was the day's best performer,
rising 6.20 to 683.92. Trading volume on the New York SE totalled 277.4m
shares and rises led declines by 1,264 to 626.
Markets spent the morning digesting the gains earned on Tuesday, when a rush
of late buying left the Dow 45 points ahead. Consequently, prices opened
slightly lower as some investors took profits and others sat on the
sidelines wait-ing for the markets' next move.
Gradually, stocks recovered from their early losses, aided by another big
rally in the US Treasury market, where technical buying and hopes for lower
German interest rates pushed the yield on the benchmark 30-year bond to
below 6.8 per cent for the first time ever. Low interest rates are good for
equity investors, because they provide companies with cheap capital for
restructuring or expansion, and cut the cost of mortgages and other
borrowings for consumers.
The latest drop in long-term interest rates boosted financial stocks,
especially mortgage providers and banks, which usually see an increase in
loan demand when borrowing costs fall. Federal National Mortgage Association
climbed Dollars 1 to Dollars 82, Countrywide Credit put on Dollars 1 1/8 at
Dollars 34 7/8 , and Federal Home Loan Mortgage rose Dollars 1 3/8 to
Dollars 49 3/8 before slipping back to end just Dollars  1/4 higher at
Dollars 48 1/4 .
Among banking issues, Wells Fargo advanced Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 103 3/8
and Chase Manhattan rose Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 32 5/8 . Citicorp added
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 26 3/8 in spite of a downgrade from NatWest
Securities, which believes that the bank's strong performance will begin to
wane in the second half of this year and in 1994.
General Cinema moved forward Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 35 5/8 after the
company announced first-quarter net income of 40 cents a share, up from the
34 cents a share reported as operating income a year ago.
Woolworth receded Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 28 3/4 after the big retailing
group reported fourth-quarter after-tax profits of Dollars 165m.
On the Nasdaq market, prices continued to recover from recent losses.
ChemTrak rose a further Dollars 2 3/4 to Dollars 15, with investors
continuing to pick up the stock following the announcement that the US Food
and Drug Administration has approved the sale of the company's
non-prescription home cholesterol test.
Canada
TORONTO rallied further in very heavy trading, boosted by a round of prime
lending rate cuts and a rise in Canada's bond and currency markets.
The TSE 300 index ended 21.0 higher at 3,467.2 in volume of 61.9m shares, up
from Tuesday's 52.8m. Wednesday's volume included two block trades in
TransCanada PipeLines totalling about 6m shares. Rises led falls by 393 to
296.
Mitel said it will sell 22m common shares at CDollars 2.05 a share in
Canada. Four entities advised by Schroder Ventures will purchase about 4.9m
of the shares. The stock surged 22 cents to CDollars 2.24.

CONCERN that the government is planning tough measures for its budget on
March 17 weighed on a Johannesburg market already unsettled by worries about
De Beers' year-end results, due next week.
The overall index shed 30 to 3,367 and industrials ended 37 lower at 4,429.
Golds gave up an early, small advance to finish unchanged at 947.
De Beers was R2.75 down at R64.25, but off the day's low of R64.10, with
analysts sharply divided in their views on the company's performance.

FT  04 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: A period of expansion dawns for NZ
equities - Terry Hall observes a new mood among investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Trading on the New Zealand stock market continued its stop-go pattern this
week, with investors concentrating on the flow of results from heavyweight
stocks.
There is unusual interest in these results, mostly for stocks with December
31 balance dates, because of widespread awareness that the economy is
changing as it moves out of recession.
Investors are keen to see which companies are coping best, as New Zealand
comes to terms with its strongest expansion since 1984-85. They also want
evidence that the companies will cope well with the new environment by
ruthlessly cutting costs and debt in pursuit of continued profit
improvements.
The past three quarters have seen business confidence at its highest level
since 1972-73, matched by a flow of encouraging statistics on everything
from GDP growth, to low inflation, and increased investment in manufacturing
and farming.
Against this is concern that rising imports may damage the balance of
payments and exports may fall because of the international recession. For
example wool earnings, although now a relatively minor export, are sharply
down.
There is also the prospect of another rise in interest rates if the Reserve
Bank repeats its January action and intervenes to support the New Zealand
dollar in pursuit of its low inflation target. It is also election year,
with the ruling pro-business National Party trailing in the polls.
Most companies in the February reporting round have announced profits in
line with, or better than expectations. Telecom Corporation, now the biggest
company in the country, accounting for 19.9 per cent of the NZSE-40 index,
soared 60 cents from early January, reaching a high of Dollars 2.87 (Dollars
1.50) on February 16. This followed its announcement of a 9.7 per cent rise
in profits in the nine months to December 31. The group also said it was
making a further 5,200 staff redundant during the next four years in a
determined bid to stay competitive.
Telecom, which eased back subsequently in line with the setback in Wall
Street, where it is also listed, has since rallied, closing yesterday at
NZDollars 2.64.
Fletcher Challenge, the forestry and energy group, announced a six month
profit in line with expectations, and confirmed that its asset selling
programme was on target. It ended yesterday at NZDollars 2.57, up from
NZDollars 1.52 last October. The NZSE-40 index closed yesterday at 1,588.03.
Attention is now focused on Brierley Investments' result, due to be released
today. The shares closed yesterday at NZDollars 1.09. Brierley has also been
re-rated after disclosing wide ranging restructuring plans, including
boardroom changes, in November, when it had traded as low as 82 cents.
Brierley is expected to announce half-year earnings of around NZDollars 105m
(up from NZDollars 90m), including profits of up to NZDollars 50m on recent
sales. The group's New Zealand profits are expected to be up sharply, in
line with the improving economy, although a negative contribution is
expected from its investment in a UK hotel group.
Analysts have lifted their earnings estimates for most of the leading
companies that have so far reported, based on the strong rise in GDP and
continued cost cutting. However some second-line stocks have been marked
back after reporting profits below expectations.
There is a widespread view among brokers and analysts that the market could
continue to mark time until the March 31 tax period. This will allow
investors to come to terms with the recent strong upward price movements in
the leaders. Leading broker Buttle Wilson described the prices of the
leaders this week as 'only mildly cheap'.
However, a wild card is the influence of Wall Street, Australia and other
markets. International investors are taking an increasing interest in New
Zealand equities, leading to 24-hour trading with New York and other
northern hemisphere markets.

FT  04 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses await word from
Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPINION was evenly divided among observers yesterday as to whether the
Bundesbank would cut interest rates at today's meeting, writes Our Markets
Staff.
Among the reasons offered for at least a 0.5 percentage point reduction were
progress on securing wage settlements at around 3 per cent, and a cut in
minimum reserve requirements announced on Monday. The pro-camp also noted
that the next council meeting on March 18 was very near to the French
elections and the Bundesbank might not want to lower rates at such a
politically sensitive time. Others commented that the need to reach an
agreement on the solidarity pact might delay a decision.
As many bourses marked time yesterday observers agreed that whatever
happened today German rates were set to decline by up to 2 percentage points
over the year, and that this would sustain momentum in the medium term.
FRANKFURT moved in a narrow range during the day, the DAX index shedding
3.01 to 1,693.73 as turnover rose to DM8.1bn from DM6.8bn.
Among financials Commerzbank put on DM1 to DM290, Deutsche DM2 to DM713 and
Dresdner DM1.20 to DM408.50.
Chemicals remained under pressure with Basf down DM2.40 to DM231.20 and
Hoechst easing DM4.30 to DM256.60.
PARIS retreated from Tuesday's 2,000 level as Chargeurs surprised the market
with 1992 earnings below most forecasts and the shares lost FFr115 to
FFr1,285.
The CAC-40 index finished 6.26 lower at 1,995.24 in turnover of some
FFr3.2bn.
Suez, which reported an estimated 1992 loss of some FFr1.9bn after the
close, saw the shares ease in anticipation FFr4.10 to FFr296.40. Eurotunnel
was off FFr1.35 at FFr39.90 as talks with TML in London ended without
agreement, while Peugeot lost FFr18 to FFr621 on further warnings of
depressed European car sales.
AMSTERDAM saw a rise in the CBS Tendency index of 0.6 to 99.9 as Philips
advanced 90 cents to Fl 21.10 ahead of today's results which are expected to
disappoint, while Polygram, up Fl 1.20 at Fl 47.20, improved after Tuesday's
good results. Hagemeyer rose Fl 1.40 to Fl 155.20 on plans for a two-for-one
share split. DSM and Heineken, which complete today's batch of results, were
respectively 30 cents lower and Fl 1.20 higher at Fl 71.60 and Fl 186.30.
ZURICH succumbed to profit-taking after a firm start but prices picked up
towards the close with investors encouraged by lower Swiss money market
rates and Wall Street's opening. The SMI index closed 11.3 ahead at 2,142.0
after a day's high of 2,151.98.
The market took its lead from renewed interest in Roche certificates, after
their recent consolidation and the shares rose SFr60 to SFr4,010.
Banks were mixed with some swapping noted out of Union Bank of Switzerland
and into CS Holding and Swiss Bank. UBS bearers eased SFr1 to SFr944 while
SBC bearers rose SFr1 to SFr366 ahead of next week's annual news conference.
CS Holding bearers added SFr20 to SFr2,230 ahead of Friday's 1992 earnings
figures from Credit Suisse.
Nestle put on SFr10 to SFr1,140 as the European Commission said that the
proposed sale of four French mineral water brands were sufficient to make
Nestle's takeover of Perrier compatible with EC competition rules.
MILAN found private domestic investors making the running, in the absence of
the institutional and foreign buyers, and attention switched to second-line
stocks and some recent laggards among the blue chips. The Comit index dipped
3.54 to 533.14
Among blue chips regarded as recent under-performers, Olivetti rose L170 or
7.4 per cent to L2,450 and Montedison firmed L50 to L1,290 after hours.
STOCKHOLM moved higher encouraged by lower domestic interest rates and the
Affarsvarlden general index ended up 4.3 to 1,018.6. Turnover weakened to
SKr709 from SKr729.
ISTANBUL shares rebounded 3.1 per cent in active buying after the 7.5 per
cent decline of the previous three sessions as investors ignored a severe
cash shortage faced by banks due to TL16,800bn of auction payments to the
Treasury. The market index rose 176.72 to 5,813.97 after losing 454.33
points since last Wednesday's all-time-high close.

FT  04 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong closes at a
new high for 1993
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERN about earnings at leading blue chip exporters prompted late selling
and the Nikkei average lost ground for the third consecutive day, writes
Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed 10.33 easier at 16,853.92 after a high for the
day of 16,949.33 set in the morning session and a low of 16,811.98 in the
afternoon. The index firmed in the morning on active buying in Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone stocks, but later lost ground as the yen
strengthened above the Y117 level against the dollar.
Trading volume totalled 240m shares, against Tuesday's 228m. Declines
outnumbered advances by 497 to 458, with 183 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks slipped 3.24 to 1,272.58, and in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 0.88 off at 1,017.16.
Interest in NTT and companies linked to telecommunications supported the
market in early trading. Comments by Mr Kabun Muto, head of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party's tax system research commission, calling for NTT
to buy shares held by the government, together with a rise in city-call
rates, boosted sentiment.
NTT finished Y24,000 ahead at Y682,000 on trading of 54,624 shares, the
heaviest since April 21, 1987. Nomura Research Institute said a range
between Y680,000 to Y770,000 reflected NTT's business and financial
fundamentals.
Companies with close ties to NTT also gained ground, with Nippon Comsys
firming Y4 to Y731 and Kyowa Exeo advancing Y11 to Y870. Cable companies
were strong, with Mitsubishi Cable gaining Y5 at Y585 and Fujikura Y10 at
Y579.
The stronger yen helped electric utilities, which would see lower fuel
import costs due to a higher currency. The electric power sector advanced
1.36 per cent, with Tokyo Electric Power appreciating Y70 to Y2,680 and
Kansai Electric Power Y40 to Y2,420.
However, high-technology exporters slipped on fears of lower earnings.
Matsushita Electric Industrial weakened Y30 to Y1,010 and TDK dropped Y190
to Y3,000.
Mazda Motor retreated Y11 to Y412 on its announcement that it had terminated
negotiations with Ford Motor, of the US, to start a European vehicle
production venture.
In Osaka, the OSE average receded 60.17 to 17,926.65 in volume of 35.3m
shares. The higher yen hurt Nintendo, the video game maker, which declined
Y170 to Y9,720.
Roundup
SOME Pacific Rim markets managed strong advances but others were more
restrained.
HONG KONG moved ahead to set a 1993 high, encouraged by forecasts of strong
economic growth by Mr Hamish Macleod, the financial secretary, in his 1993
budget speech, and by the view that Mr Chris Patten, the governor, was
showing signs of agreeing to some Chinese conditions for talks on the
colony's political future.
The Hang Seng index rose 92.41, or 1.46 per cent, to 6,436.64, helped by
strong US institutional demand. Turnover was high at HKDollars 3.7bn. The
Hang Seng's all-time closing peak of 6,447 was set on November 12, before
the Sino-British row wiped more than 20 per cent from stock values.
Among the most active issues, Citic Pacific was 60 cents higher at HKDollars
16.50, HSBC up HK1.50 at HKDollars 66 and Hutchison Whampoa 10 cents ahead
at HKDollars 17.90.
TAIWAN was the centre of very heavy speculative demand that took shares 5.5
per cent higher in a round of bargain hunting after Tuesday's 3.8 per cent
fall. The weighted index ended 237.62 stronger at an eight-month high of
4,582.61. Turnover remained heavy, although it was down from Tuesday's
TDollars 93.1bn to TDollars 74bn.
MANILA was another firm spot and the composite index advanced 44.72, or 3
per cent, to 1,518.67. Manila Electric 'B' shares rose 15 pesos to 295 pesos
on expectations of good 1992 earnings and rumours of a stock dividend.
AUSTRALIAN shares retreated steadily during the day as the Labor party's
rise in the opinion polls provoked a round of profit-taking.
The All Ordinaries index opened briefly higher, taking its lead from Wall
Street's overnight performance, but it soon turned down to finish a net 18.9
lower at 1,626.1 in modest turnover of ADollars 312.2m.
SINGAPORE ended little changed after failing to sustain gains made in the
afternoon from selective buying. The Straits Times Industrial index lost
0.76 at 1,652.05.
BANGKOK relinquished the gains made on Tuesday, the SET index shedding 16.49
 -half of it in afternoon trade - to 905.99 in sluggish trade.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Money Markets: An important day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTEREST RATE futures in Europe rose again yesterday as dealers continued to
assume that the Bundesbank would cut Germany's discount rate at its council
meeting today, writes James Blitz.
There was one clear sign yesterday that the Bundesbank was happy to see
monetary policy relax a little. The central bank drained a net DM2.4bn from
the banking system when accepting bids for this week's allocation of funds.
The draining was rather less than the market had expected, following the
addition of DM32bn of funds through the relaxation of minimum reserve
requirements at the start of the week. Taking the recent issue of short-term
bills into account, a net DM15bn of funds has been added to the system.
This helped German call money down to 8.59 per cent yesterday, from 9 per
cent earlier in the week. Three-month money dropped to 8.18 per cent.
Both of these moves helped the March Euromark contract to climb 8 basis
points to a close of 92.04. But the contract's rise also clearly assumed
that the official discount rate will be cut today, because it is pricing
three-month money at 7.96 per cent when the contract expires in 10 days'
time.
The market's assumption is that the discount floor, now at 8.00 per cent,
will be lowered. Both the growing recession in Germany and recent money
supply figures showing a net drop in M3 growth underline the possibility
that the central bank council might ease policy today. But the Bundesbank
may await the results of talks on a Solidarity Pact between the German
government, oppo-sition and trade unions before moving rates.
The March French franc contract was unchanged at 88.60. But the June
contract advanced 10 basis points to finish at 93.12, reflect-ing
assumptions that French rates must come down by the summer.
The March short sterling contract gained 8 basis points yesterday, ending at
94.07. It was helped by the Bundes-bank's money market oper-ations and a
monthly report by the UK Treasury suggesting that the UK economy should show
signs of recovery this year.
Three-month sterling cash firmed  1/16 percentage point to 6 1/16 per cent
because of difficulties removing a shortage of Pounds 1.95bn forecast by the
Bank of England.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Waiting for the Bundesbank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH THE dollar and sterling registered small gains against the D-Mark in
European trading yesterday after the Bundesbank drained rather less
liquidity from the German money market than dealers had expected, writes
James Blitz.
Around DM32bn of funds have been added to the market this week in the wake
of the easing of minimum reserve requirements for German banks. Although
some DM14.8bn was drained earlier in the week by the introduction of
short-term bills to the market, the Bundesbank only withdrew a further
DM2.4bn from the system yesterday in its weekly operations.
This brought a slight lowering in D-Mark money market rates. The
Bundesbank's accommodative stance made the comparatively low short-term
rates in the US and UK look less cheap. The dollar closed  1/4 pfennig
firmer in Europe at DM1.6450, while the pound continued the week's rally to
end  1/2 pfennig higher at DM2.3850. In New York the US currency finished a
shade higher at DM1.6453.
If the moves in the dollar and sterling were muted, it was probably because
dealers were waiting for the two most important events of the week: today's
Bundesbank council meeting and tomorrow's non-farm payroll figure.
Will the Bundesbank ease official rates today? The council's deliberations
are, in the final analysis, unpredictable. But Miss Alison Cottrell of
Midland Global Markets believes the council will only announce a lower fixed
rate repo for next week.
In her view, recent declarations by two regional council members that
inflation was not beaten put the council's hawks in the ascendant. She also
believes that a small cut in the discount rate might backfire on the
Bundesbank, because it would suggest to the foreign exchange markets that
German rates were coming down too slowly to take pressure off the French
authorities - and this might bring a return to the strains in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Christian Dunis, an economist at Chemical Bank in London, also believes
that there is insufficient pressure in the ERM to force the Bundesbank to
ease policy.
He said the Bundesbank could leave official rates untouched at both today's
meeting and the one on March 18 because the most likely time for pressure to
return will be after a right wing government is elected in France at the end
of the month.
However, other economists believe the economic outlook in Germany is
deteriorating at such a pace that the Bundesbank will be forced to stimulate
policy as soon as possible.
A critical test for the pound in the remainder of this week will be whether
it crosses the crucial DM2.40 barrier against the D-Mark. But Mr Ian Harnett
of Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull thinks the UK currency will be sold
down again whether the Bundesbank eases today or not.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brazilians cannot afford to cut
aluminium losses - It would cost more to close production lines than to keep
them running
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY HOPES that Brazil will this year relieve the pressure of oversupply on
the languishing aluminium market by cutting its output seem destined to be
disappointed. Despite a combination of low international prices and what
local industry considers high domestic energy costs, the country registered
record production of aluminium in 1992, and output is expected to remain at
a similar level this year.
The Brazilian Aluminum Association (ABAL) estimates last year's production
at 1.19m , up 4.8 per cent on 1991's, and exports at 985,700 tonnes, up 18.8
per cent.
The production increase was primarily due to a 16 per cent surge, to about
335,000 tonnes, by Albras, the joint venture between Companhia Vale do Rio
Doce and a consortium of Japanese companies. Companhia Aluminio do Brasil
boosted production by 13,000 tonnes, as it utilised its full capacity of
217,000 tonnes.
The Albras increase was a consequence of a scheme launched in 1988, designed
to double output, says Mr Francisco Pitella, commercial director for
Aluvale, the CVRD holding company for its aluminium interests. In 1988, the
plant was producing about 160,000 tonnes. Under the plan, capacity would
have jumped to 340,000 tonnes in 1991. In March 1991, however, a damaged
transmission line caused a 12-hour blackout, cutting production by about
40,000 tonnes, and pushing back the timetable for reaching higher production
levels to 1992.
There should be a slight drop in the country's aluminium output this year as
Alcan's closure in November of a 27,000-tonnes-a-year production line in
Aratu, Bahia state, makes its mark on the 1993 figures. The plant produces
aluminium to supply its own domestic operations. But with the severe
recession and dampened demand in Brazil, the subsidiary found itself
exporting. 'The quantity we were producing was in excess of our needs, and
at Dollars 1,400 a tonne cash cost, we were realising at least a Dollars
150-a-tonne loss,' explains Mr Joao Valiante, manager of metal planning.
The output cut can be viewed as part of the company's overall effort to
reduce costs in Brazil. The company now employs less than 5,000 workers,
compared with 8,000 in 1989, says Mr Valiante. Efficiency has improved, as
capacity was reduced by just 27,000 tonnes a year over the same period. In
1991 Alcan produced 113,600 tonnes.
Other producers refuse to cut output because the cost of closing production
lines is greater than that of keeping them running, according to Mr Ivo
Barone, ABAL's president. 'The price level still allows companies to break
even on a cash-cost basis, depending on their energy costs,' says Mr Barone.
Many energy contracts are 'take-or-pay' agreements, long-term accords that
guarantee aluminium producers a minimum supply for which they must pay even
if they do not take it up. Some bauxite supply contracts run on a
'take-and-pay' basis, meaning that producers must withdraw their share of
raw material whether or not they intend to use it. 'It comes down to what is
more costly, to continue producing or to close,' observes Mr Barone.
For that reason, many firms have begun working with a cash-cost philosophy,
which ignores depreciation, says the ABAL president. Reducing fixed
expenditures, producers try to get their cash expenses down to Dollars 1,200
a tonne, allowing them to limp through the present crisis.
High energy costs are the main obstacle to the Brazilian industry's ability
to compete, maintains Mr Barone. He claims that energy accounts for Dollars
450 in the price of a tonne of Brazilian aluminium, compared with an
international average of Dollars 300 a tonne.
Albras and Alumar enjoy discounts and price ceilings based on international
prices for the commodity, part of an incentive package for building plants
in the underdeveloped north of the country. Other companies, including CBA,
Alcan and Valesul, generate varying amounts of their own energy.
Aluminium producers in south-central Brazil, the country's most
industrialised region, spend Dollars 23 per MW hour for their electricity,
compared to Dollars 9 in Canada and Dollars 20 in the US, says Mr Carlos
Eduardo Mariano da Silva, Valesul's industrial director.
The cost of energy is a touchy subject in Brazil. Congress has just passed a
Bill to give regional utility companies a free hand to set electricity
prices without meddling by central authorities. Large industrial users
generally pay about Dollars 45 per MW hour, compared with an average
generating cost of Dollars 70 per megawatt hour.
Valesul, a joint venture involving CVRD and Royal Dutch/Shell's Brazilian
metal subsidiary Billiton, hopes to reduce energy costs by both increasing
efficiency and boosting its own generating capacity. Currently Valesul
generates about 20 per cent of its own electricity.
This year it is implementing a pilot project designed to improve the
efficiency of its production process. The company will invest Dollars 2.5m
this year, and if the pilot project is successful, it is ready to spend
Dollars 37m by 1995 to adapt its entire plant, says Mr Mariano da Silva.
In terms of generating capacity, Valesul's goal is to increase its own
output to 50 per cent, adds Mr Mariano da Silva. To reach that level, he
estimates that the company would have to invest Dollars 55m. 'But we have to
find an investment opportunity,' he says, adding that such an investment is
not yet officially in the cards.
Low, and falling, domestic consumption means that Brazilian producers are
forced to place greater amounts of their output on the international market,
despite low prices. Domestic per capita aluminium consumption dropped from
3.1 kg in 1986 to an estimated 2.1 kg in 1992, says CVRD's Mr Pitella,
adding that consumption in rich countries is about 20 kg a person a year.
Overall Brazilian consumption was 316,000 tonnes in 1992, an 8 per cent drop
from 338,000 tonnes in 1991.
'Last year domestic production fell to the level of the early 1980s, but if
it weren't for greater use of aluminium cans, we might have dropped back to
levels from the late 1970s,' observes Mr Adjarma Azevedo, executive director
for the local subsidiary of Alcoa.
Domestic demand seems to be rebounding slightly. In December, it was 5 per
cent above expectations, in January 10 per cent more than expected,
estimates Mr Valiante of Alcan.
'The Brazilian market is apparently improving, but I am afraid to talk about
a boom,' he says, echoing the words of other analysts. 'I don't know how
long it will last.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russians leave US without grain
debt deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALEKSANDR Shokhin, Russian first deputy prime minister, left Washington
yesterday without an agreement on ending his country's grain credit
problems, leaving US-Russian grain trade stalled.
After Mr Shokhin and Mr Mike Espy, the US agriculture secretary, ended their
talks on Tuesday Mr Espy said he remained dedicated to finding a solution to
the impasse, but he had no specific timetable.
Grain traders remain convinced that the US will offer Russia a grain export
programme of some kind - most likely food aid - when Presidents Clinton and
Yeltsin meet for a summit April 4.
However, Mr Espy said he did not view that date as a deadline and added that
there were some outstanding problems.
Disappointed traders pushed Chicago grain and soyabean futures prices lower
in early trading. Mr Warren King, grain analyst with Cargill Investors
Services, said he was preparing to reduce his forecast of wheat exports to
Russia.
'The (wheat) marketing year is over in June,' he said. 'We're running out of
time.'
Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union owe more than Dollars
416m in overdue loans for US grain purchases. Russia made what was viewed as
a token interest payment of Dollars 15m, the first since late November,
before Mr Shokhin and Mr Espy held their final meeting.
Under the US guaranteed loan programme, Russia must repay all of its arrears
before fresh grain loans can be granted.
To lower the bill, Mr Shokhin has requested that Russia's grain indebtedness
to the US be separated from other former Soviet republics.
In a speech in Chicago on Tuesday evening, Mr Yegor Gaidar, chief economic
adviser to President Yeltsin, explained that Russia was balancing its
obligations to the US against its indebtedness to other Paris Club nations.
'We fulfilled our payments to the US until November, neglecting other
members of the Paris Club, which affected our relations with Europe and
Japan,' he said.
'We're looking for a way out without hurting our relationship with other
countries of the world.'
Russia has made strategic payments to at least one other wheat supplier to
keep world grain shipments moving. The Australian Wheat Board said it had
received payments on grain shipped to Russia two years ago and had
contracted to supply an undisclosed further amount of Australian grain.
'A small cash payment has been received from the Russians and shipments of
Australian wheat will commence against that payment,' said Wheat Board
chairman Mr Clinton Condon.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Energy boost planned for
Australia's Kalgoorlie mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PERTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN ABOUT two years time a 2,000 km (1,250 mile) pipeline costing between
ADollars 300m and ADollars 500m (Pounds 147m-Pounds 245m) could be carrying
natural gas from Dampier in the north of Western Australia to the Kalgoorlie
gold fields area, providing cheap energy to boost natural resources
development there, according to Mr Colin Barnett, the state's new minister
for resources development and energy.
Western Mining Corporation, the biggest energy user in the area, would
almost certainly be involved, either as a member of a consortium that would
build and operate the pipeline or as a customer. Mr Barnett said yesterday
that the pipeline would bring inexpensive energy to an area where supplies
were not consistent and many companies used diesel fuel to provide their own
power.
The pipeline project was of a type that should be sponsored by the new
Coalition state government, which was committed to building the state
economy on its natural resources.
He claimed that the change of government had sparked new optimism among
resource companies. Since the election two weeks ago Western Mining had
announced that it would proceed with the ADollars 450m Mt Keith nickel
project in the state and Woodside Petroleum had given the go-ahead for the
ADollars 1.1bn Cossack Wanea offshore oil and gas venture.
He said the government would change the state law to permit
seven-days-a-week working in the Kambalada area, near Kalgoorlie. Western
Mining was ready to proceed with an ADollars 105m expansion and upgrading
scheme at its Kambalada nickel operations once that change had been made.
The trade unions were 'reasonably satisfied' with this proposed change in
the law, which was at the centre of a long running argument between Western
Mining and the previous Labor government. 'We will not let minority
interests hold the rest of the community to ransom,' Mr Barnett said.
Western Mining also previously said the cost of rail transport was holding
back development at Kambalada. Mr Barnett said the state-owned railways
would become more competitive and that the cost of transport would not be
permitted to prevent projects going forward.
His government was committed to reducing the cost of energy by 40 per cent
in real terms by 2000 by splitting up the state energy monopoly and
encouraging private sector investment. Barnett admitted that he expected
some opposition to the pipeline project, but the route would avoid national
parks, environmentally sensitive areas and areas know to be of special
significance to aboriginal people.
He hoped permitting procedures would be completed by the middle of 1994 and
then the pipeline would take 18 to 24 months to build.
Local analysts suggested that one project likely to benefit from the
pipeline was the Bulong nickel-cobalt venture between Western Mining and
Resolute Resources and its associate Energy Oil &amp; Gas, which would include
Western building a sulphuric acid plant at its Kalgoorlie nickel smelter to
process the ore.
Mr Barnett said Western Australia was relatively unexplored for minerals,
while the potential for offshore oil and gas discoveries was huge. His
government wanted to see state revenue from natural resource projects
quickly doubled. Direct royalties alone last year brought in ADollars 375m.
However, the state's small population of 1.7m could not provide the
necessary capital and this would come mainly from foreign investors. The
government is to send high powered delegations around the would promoting
Western Australia as 'a safe and reliable place to invest'.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trinidad fertiliser sector
prepares to resume growth - Depressed prices have tempered the industry's
buoyancy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEPRESSED PRICES over the past nine months, caused mainly by increased
production in the Ukraine, have tempered the buoyancy of Trinidad and
Tobago's fertiliser industry. This has exacerbated a slowdown in growth of
the industry over the past three years following rapid expansion in
nitrogenous fertiliser output between 1980 and 1989.
The Caribbean republic remains one of the world's leading producers of
ammonia and urea - the leader since the break-up of the Soviet Union, claim
local officials. Senior representatives of the energy and natural resources
ministry say they are not greatly concerned at the sate of market as the
country has the capacity to take advantage of the rebound that they believe
is inevitable.
This, however, will depend on a quick and significant increase in production
capacity. Combined output of ammonia and urea last year was 2.4m tonnes,
while installed capacity is 2.5m tonnes.
The feedstock for the fertiliser plants is locally-produced natural gas, and
officials say any significant expansion in ammonia and urea output must
await an increase in gas recovery. This is expected from a major gas field
off Trinidad's south-east coast in which three state-owned companies and
Enron Oil and Gas of Texas are investing USDollars 250m over the next five
years to recover 150m cubic feet of gas a day.
'The development of Trinidad and Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser industry
has been assisted significantly by the advantage of local supplies of
energy,' explains Mr Rupert Mends, the permanent secretary in the energy and
natural resources ministry. 'We are also favoured by relatively easy and
quick access to our major markets in the US and Europe.'
Ammonia and urea production in 1991 was 4.6 per cent more than in 1990,
indicating a significant slow-down after a five-fold expansion between 1981
and 1989. The Trinidad and Tobago central bank, in a recent report, suggests
that such rates of growth may not be repeated in the short term.
The bank says that in the first half of last year production of nitrogenous
fertilisers totalled 1.23m tonnes, marginally higher than in 1991. But it
reports that international ammonia markets have been depressed, and that
this has coincided with the end of the fertiliser application season in
North America and Europe, with reduced demand in these areas.
'In addition, the easy availability of the product from the Ukraine
contributed to oversupply on global markets and consequently to lower
prices,' the bank says.
It reports that Trinidad and Tobago's ammonia averaged USDollars 77 a tonne
(fob Caribbean) in the second quarter of last year, against Dollars 97 a
tonne in the second quarter of 1991. Urea prices fell Dollars 21 from
Dollars 155 per tonne in 1991.
Trinidad and Tobago's nitrogenous fertiliser industry was born 30 years ago
when WR Grace of New York established Fedchem, an ammonia plant with a rated
capacity of 250,000 tonnes a year.
Thirteen years later the US company and the Trinidad and Tobago government
created a joint venture, Tringen, to run a 400,000-tonnes-a-year ammonia
plant. The facility was expanded in 1988 and now has a rated capacity of
920,000 tonnes a year.
Following a corporate decision to divest itself of its holdings in
fertilisers, WR Grace has sold its operations in Trinidad and Tobago to
Norsk Hydro of Norway.
A third ammonia plant, Fertrin, a joint venture between Amoco Oil of the US
and the Trinidad and Tobago government, began production in 1981.
The sole urea producer, the wholly state-owned Trinidad and Tobago Urea
Company, has a capacity of 600,000 tonnes per year.
The government is seeking buyers for its 51 per cent holding in Fertrin and
for the urea company.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Over-supply and over-stocking apply through much of the wool market. In
Australia there is the official stockpile of nearly 4 million bales,
practically a full season's output, which overhangs the market even though
disposals ara currently at a standstill. Resistance to present low prices ,
in real terms the lowest on record, is causing Australian growers to
withdraw their wool and this involves a privately held and financed backlog
which again overhangs the market. Processors in major consumer countries in
Europe and the Far East are often heavily stocked also.

London COCOA headed south, weighed down by a New York market in retreat on
what traders described as liquidation related to the lack of progress at the
Geneva pact negotiations. 'People had taken long positions as protection
before the talks began. But it's becoming increasingly clear nothing is
going to happen so they're getting out,' one dealer said. On the London
bullion market PLATINUM, after fixing at Dollars 342.75 a troy ounce - 25
cents up from the morning - largely recovered the ground lost following
Allied-Signal's announcement of a new palladium-based auto catalyst.
PALLADIUM was marked down 25 cents at the afternoon fix to Dollars 105 a
troy ounce. BASE METAL price movements were less extreme on the LME, largely
consolidating after the losses sustained over the last week. However,
consumer demand remains thin, and once technical corrections have run their
course, many metals remain vulnerable unless there is a sea-change in
sentiment.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: German issues advance as rate cut hopes
gain ground

GERMAN government bonds advanced again yesterday on renewed confidence that
official interest rates were about to head lower. This was despite a setback
in the bond market on Tuesday, caused by the Bundesbank's decision not to
lower money market rates through its regular repurchase agreement (or repo)
auction.
The March bund futures contract on Liffe moved ahead from 95.47 to 95.82
late in the day on moderate trading of around 50,000 contracts, while the
June contract advanced from 95.89 to 96.20.
Traders said that the fixed-rate repo on Tuesday at 8.49 per cent did not
necessarily mean that the Bundesbank would not cut rates after its council
meeting today, despite earlier disappointment in the market.
Views seemed finely balanced, with some analysts arguing that the Bundesbank
would not act for another two weeks, until after the so-called Solidarity
Pact to stimulate economic growth in eastern Germany had been finalised.
Others said a cut at that time, just ahead of the French election, could
look too much like a panic measure, prompting the authorities to move today
instead.
On balance, a majority of analysts were still predicting a 50 basis-point
cut in both the official Lombard and Discount rates would come today.
LONG-DATED UK government bonds moved ahead by as much as one-third of a
point on the German rate cut hopes, leading to a further flattening of the
gilt yield curve.
The spread between three-year and 15-year gilts fell to almost 150 basis
points, having stood at 200 basis points a month ago.
As the market moved ahead, two Pounds 250m of tranches of new stock issued
on Monday were sold out. These were the 9 3/4 per cent gilts due 2002 and
the 8 3/4 per cent gilts due 2017.
In quiet trading, the June gilts contract on Liffe moved ahead from 106 1/4
to 106 1/2 .
FRENCH government bonds reacted strongly yesterday to the prospects of lower
rates in Germany, pushing the yield premium on French bonds to its lowest
level for a month. The spread over the yield on 10-year German bonds slipped
to 75 basis points, having started the week at around 90 basis points.
The advance came despite the prospect of today's auction of FFr18bn to
FFr20bn of government bonds, with the bulk expected in the 10-year area.
TECHNICAL factors and central bank demand helped US Treasury prices rally
strongly at the long end of the maturity range yesterday, sending the
30-year yield to record lows.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  25/32 at 104
13/32 , yielding 6.774 per cent, the lowest point since the issue was
launched in 1977. At the short end of the market, the two-year note was
3/32 at 100 1/8 , to yield 3.789 per cent. Traders said there was no single
reason for the strong gains at the long end. Some of the rise was attributed
to expectations that the Federal Reserve would soon be buying large amounts
of government securities to meet seasonal needs related to the end of the
tax year.
Other factors at play included: buying by unidentified central banks, which
forced some short-covering by dealers; hopes for lower German interest
rates; weaker-than-expected car sales figures; investors switching into
bonds out of lower-yielding mortgage-backed securities; and municipal
defeasance programmes, where municipal funds buy Treasuries and use the cash
flow from them to pay off old debt obligations.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Guidelines set for unit
trusts and derivatives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO NEW sets of guidelines, from the Securities and Investment Board (SIB)
and the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (IMRO), should smooth
the path for unit trust managers who want to use derivative instruments.
But no decisions have yet been taken on any substantial reform of regulatory
policy in this area: the SIB will deal with the main policy issues
surrounding derivatives legislation in a separate consultative document due
this spring.
Currently, derivative instruments can be used by unit trusts in two ways:
firstly, unit trust managers can use derivatives for efficient portfolio
management; secondly, under 1991 regulations, derivatives can be used in
futures and options funds (Fofs), or geared futures and options funds
(GFofs).
While a handful of companies have launched Fofs, no GFofs have yet been
offered. The unit trust industry has been lobbying for existing legislation
to be expanded to allow guaranteed funds, limited issues and performance
fees. These issues will be discussed in the second consultative paper due
this spring.
Mr Philip Warland, director general of the Unit Trust Association, said
there was an increasing feeling that Fofs should never have been separated
from other unit trusts, which can also use derivatives. Among potential
changes was the extension to the EC directive on collective investments to
include Fofs. The UK delegation has tabled a proposal to permit funds
complying with the directive to undertake tactical asset allocation.
Last week's guidance from the SIB and IMRO focuses on the area of efficient
portfolio management.
IMRO has issued guidance to clarify previous recommendations on the use of
index derivatives, regarding congruence between the components of the index
and the stocks in the portfolio. IMRO stops short of recommending any target
for correlation, but recommends a procedure for fund managers to follow in
deciding what index derivative trading is appropriate.

BELGIUM'S largest independent stockbroker and third-largest bank have joined
forces in an attempt to gain an edge over London-based specialists on the
fledgling Belgian derivatives market.
Peterbroeck, Van Campenhout (Petercam) and Kredietbank marked the formation
of Kredietbank-Petercam Derivatives yesterday by launching an issue of 1.5m
put and call warrants based on the Bel-20 index of largest Belgian stocks.
The warrants should be listed on the Brussels bourse next month, once new
Belgian legislation classifying the instruments as securities is formally
adopted.
Mr Remi Vermeiren, Kredietbank's managing director said the purpose was to
develop derivatives activity and expertise in Brussels, rather than leave it
to London.
Mr Vermeiren said the joint venture would not launch products to compete
directly with Belfox, the small Belgian futures and options exchange of
which he is also chairman.
Regarding Belfox, Mr Vermeiren said the exchange hoped to add an option on
the Bel-20 index to the two company options already traded, at the end of
this month, or the start of April.
The aim is to offer six to eight options, and three futures contracts,
including one on the Bel-20.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Bank of Greece makes a speedy return
with DM1bn launch
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of Greece returned to the international bond market for the second
time in just over a week, this time with an ambitious DM1bn issue of
five-year Eurobonds.
The bonds, which carry a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent, had a recommended
re-offer price of 99.85 to yield 7.78 per cent, or 156 points over the
series 104 of medium-term German government bonds. Yesterday afternoon, the
bonds were being offered at the recommended level.
An official at the lead manager, Commerzbank, said the aim of the
recommended re-offer price was to encourage the banks involved not to sell
the bonds below this level.
Demand was concentrated among co-operative and state savings banks in
Germany, attracted by the zero-risk weighting of the bonds, which means that
they do not have to set aside capital against these assets. However, the
Commerzbank official added that it would take some time to place the entire
issue.
The Eurodollar sector was active as the Caisse Francaise de Developpement
(CFD), a government agency previously known as CCCE, raised Dollars 330m
through an issue of 12-year Eurobonds. Proceeds of the issue are intended
for France's contribution to the International Monetary Fund.
The bonds, which have a coupon of 6 1/4 per cent, were priced at 99.77 to
yield 30 basis points over the 10-year US Treasury, or 21 basis points over
the less liquid 12-year US Treasury, according to the lead manager, UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
The yield spread narrowed to 28 basis points over the 10-year Treasury,
reflecting broad demand for the paper.
The Czech National Bank (CNB) also tapped the Eurodollar sector for its
first bond issue following the creation of the new Czech Republic. It raised
Dollars 300m worth of three-year notes which will be priced on or before
March 10 to yield 272 to 278 basis points over comparable US Treasuries.
An official at the lead manager, Nomura, said sales of the bonds were helped
by CNB's recent roadshows in financial centres around the world, and that
the pricing could well be brought forward as a result. CNB is not rated at
present but hopes to achieve an investment grade rating.
The European Investment Bank (EIB) raised SFr300m through an issue of
six-year Eurobonds. An official at the lead manager, Credit Suisse, said the
issue established a new benchmark with its coupon of 4 1/2 per cent. Last
week, France Telecom set a coupon of 4 3/4 per cent on its SFr150m issue of
five-year Eurobonds.
The official acknowledged that the pricing was tight, and said it would take
time to place the whole issue. Yesterday afternoon, the bonds were trading
at less 1.85 bid, inside fees, to yield 4.46 per cent.
The EIB also doubled the size of its CDollars 200m issue of 7 1/4 per cent
five-year Eurobonds, originally launched last October. The new tranche was
priced at 100.78 to yield 30 basis points over comparable Canadian
government bonds. The bonds were not freed to trade by late yesterday.
Two Latin American sovereign borrowers are due to tap the international bond
market in the coming weeks. Chase Investment Bank has won the mandate to
arrange a five-year Dollars 75m Eurobond for Uruguay, and Colombia plans a
Dollars 100m Eurobond at the beginning of April, via Bankers Trust.
Goldman Sachs has been appointed global co-ordinator for the privatisation
of Singapore Telecom, likely to take place in the second half of this year,
writes Kieran Cooke from Kuala Lumpur.
The privatisation of Singapore's telecommunications utility is likely to
value the company between SDollars 10bn (USDollars 6.1bn) and SDollars 15bn.
A 25 per cent stake in the company is likely to be offered.
A consortium of Singapore's leading banks has been appointed lead manager to
handle the domestic portion of the offering. Morgan Grenfell Asia will act
as co-manager with the banking consortium.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: CRA ahead 9.6% against falling
commodity prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CRA, the Australian mining house, has held out against the tide of falling
commodity prices to report increased sales and earnings for 1992.
Strong contributions from coal and diamonds helped the company to report a
9.6 per cent rise in equity-accounted net earnings to ADollars 411.4m
(USDollars 293.8m) from ADollars 375.4m in 1991, on a 5.8 per cent rise in
sales to ADollars 5.24bn from ADollars 4.95bn.
The annual dividend has been raised to 45 cents a share from 34 cents.
The result was also helped by the falling Australian currency and a
substantial cut in tax and financing charges. This allowed the company to
further boost its already strong balance sheet. Tax and other government
charges took ADollars 600.5m, compared with ADollars 744.9m, and financing
charges were down to ADollars 62.2m, from ADollars 115.0m.
The directors said gross balance sheet debt had fallen to ADollars 1.20bn,
from ADollars 1.51bn, reducing gearing to 20.8 per cent, from 24.9 per cent.
The company's position was further improved by a halving of capital
expenditure to ADollars 520.3m from ADollars 1.09m, while cash-flow rose to
ADollars 1.1bn from ADollars 1.0bn.
Iron ore remained the company's biggest contributor to earnings, but profits
eased to ADollars 349.1m from ADollars 416.3m. Coal increased its profits to
ADollars 102.4m from ADollars 67.1m and diamonds jumped to ADollars 82.3m
from ADollars 52.0m.
The copper/gold division turned a ADollars 24.2m loss into a ADollars 22m
profit. The contribution from aluminium more than doubled to ADollars 31.1m
from ADollars 14.6m. The lead/zinc/silver operations reduced their losses to
ADollars 6.8m from ADollars 32.1m.
The directors said the company had conducted an asset review resulting in a
ADollars 322.8m write-down of assets. They described 1992 as another
disappointing year for mineral producers and said any improvement in the
current year was highly dependent on the US, Japanese and German economies.
'The supply side of the metal equation remains one of over-supply,' they
said. 'A major contributing factor is the Commonwealth of Independent
States, which is maintaining high levels of metal exports into markets
characterised by substantial inventories and low price levels.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Overseas earnings help Boral
climb to ADollars 102.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

<TEXT>
A RISE in overseas earnings helped Boral, the Australian construction and
engineering group, reverse a downward trend in its earnings.
The company raised net profits by 12.7 per cent to ADollars 102.8m
(USDollars 73.4m) in the first half to December, from ADollars 91.3m a year
earlier, on a 10.4 per cent rise in sales to ADollars 2.09bn, from ADollars
1.89bn. The interim dividend is being held at 8 cents a share.
The directors have forecast higher profits for the full year, but said: 'Low
levels of economic activity in Australia continue to constrain demand for
many of Boral's products.
'It is hoped that confidence will improve following the forthcoming federal
election. Non-dwelling building is still at low levels, but government
expenditure on infrastructure should produce a positive contribution in the
next financial year.'
Australian Gas Light, the Sydney-based petroleum utility, has come through a
period of big asset acquisitions and disposals with a strong rise in
first-half earnings.
The company yesterday declared a rise in interim dividend to 7 cents a share
from 6 cents, following a 32.6 per cent advance in earnings to Dollars
A42.4m for the six months to December from Dollars A31.8m. Revenue rose 1.5
per cent to Dollars A477.1m.
Woodside Petroleum, the Australian offshore gas producer, has held its
annual dividend at 8 cents a share, despite dipping into the red in 1992. A
deferred tax provision of ADollars 85.8m against a nil charge previously
sent the company tumbling to net losses of Dollars A22.6m, from profits of
ADollars 116.5m the year before.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: Japan bank strengths to
diverge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASSET quality problems among Japanese banks and their capacity to deal with
bad loans will open up differences between the strongest and the weakest
banks, says IBCA, the UK ratings agency.
In a report yesterday on asset quality at Japanese banks, IBCA says city
banks - or commercial banks - are in a better position, while some trust
banks may not be able to make provisions in the next few years.
One of the more prominent problems weighing on Japan's banks has been loans
to the country's eight housing loan companies - non-financial institutions
which have been hit hard by bad property-related loans.
Including the restructuring scheme for Nippon Housing Loan, finally approved
by its creditors last week, interest foregone by 21 banks will total about 8
per cent of projected business profits.
IBCA says the average proportion of lost income opportunity for city banks
will be about 3 per cent of business profits, 17 per cent for the long-term
credit banks and 50 per cent for the trust banks.
The opening of new areas of business for banks, due to the easing of
barriers between the banking and securities industries, will also flush out
the strength differences in strength between Japanese banks.
Standard and Poor's, the US credit ratings agency, downgraded debt ratings
of Tokai Bank and Hokkaido Takushoku Bank, two Japanese city banks. Daiwa
Bank was placed under review for a possible downward revision.
S&amp;P downgraded Tokai's long-term debt to A minus, from A, due to a rise in
problem loans. Hokkaido Takushoku's short-term debt was lowered to A-3, from
A-2, due to a decline in asset quality and a rise in problem loans.

AIR New Zealand yesterday announced an 8.6 per cent rise in net profits to
NZDollars 60.9m (USDollars 32.18m) for the six months to December, from
NZDollars 56.1m a year earlier, in the face of difficult markets. Sales
advanced 6.9 per cent to NZDollars 1.16bn from NZDollars 1.09bn.
Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, said the result compared with record losses by US
airlines and generally lower earnings reported by Asian and European
carriers. He said the profit was achieved as the global industry was
experiencing little or no growth, excess aircraft capacity and aggressive
price competition.
Mr Matthew expects the company to announce profits for the full year similar
to last year's NZDollars 115.1m, given the difficult trading conditions in
the industry.
Air New Zealand said total assets rose by 16.8 per cent to NZDollars 2.81bn.
Shareholders' funds rose 9.7 per cent to NZDollars 1.08bn.
The directors said demand was 'soft' in the company's traditional markets of
the US, UK and Australia and New Zealand. The increasingly important Asian
markets of Japan and Taiwan experienced slower growth. Flight revenue to
Asia rose 13 per cent, but net earnings were relatively flat.
The company reported 'other revenue' was up NZDollars 57m to NZDollars 256m.
This was mainly due to strong growth in international cargo, while its New
Zealand subsidiary, Mount Cook Airlines, performed well due to a good ski
season.
Passenger sales revenue rose 2 per cent to NZDollars 907.85m. Interest costs
fell to NZDollars 26m from Dollars NZ34, and one-off redundancy costs
totalled NZDollars 8.2m.
The interim dividend is unchanged at 4 cents a share.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: A fresh option for HK
gamblers - Simon Holberton looks at the latest outlet for the colony's
investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE introduction of traded options on the Hong Kong Futures Exchange
tomorrow completes the rehabilitation of an institution which has fought
successfully to throw off the bad odour surrounding its closure and reform
in the aftermath of the 1987 stock market collapse.
Before the crash, Hong Kong's futures market vied with the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange for the exchange which had the biggest volume of daily
trade in index futures. That all came unstuck in October 1987 when Hong Kong
got a salutary lesson in the meaning of open-ended risk.
Mr Kevin Snowball, managing director of Morgan Grenfell Asia Futures (Hong
Kong), says: 'We now have a more professional futures market, and the
introduction of options is an extension of that.'
The exchange will offer a range of traded options built around the Hang Seng
Index - Hong Kong's bellwether stock market index - with 56 separate
contracts for trading.
Traded options have been two years in the making. According to Mr Gary
Knight, the exchange's chief executive, the exchange has put more than 700
individuals through extensive training courses. It has also acquired and
customised a version of the Chicago Options Clearing Corporation's clearing
system.
'Options have proved themselves to be an essential tool for all kinds of
investors,' says Mr Knight. 'How quick the options market grows depends
basically on the education process of all investors. But we take a very long
view on the market. We think the stock market will continue to expand on the
back of internal growth and because of Hong Kong's proximity to China.'
If the history of futures trading is a guide, then that process may not take
much time at all. The index futures began trading in May 1986 with an
average daily turnover of 1,600 contracts; by September 1987, average daily
turnover had swollen to 27,318 contracts.
Analysts believe options will appeal to local 'retail' investors and to
institutional investors. Says Mr Archie Hart, head of research at Crosby
Securities: 'There is quite a demand for geared plays in Hong Kong. In what
other country do you get grannies who take out swap deposits?"
Options on the Hang Seng Index will offer the gearing, but unlike futures,
where risk can be unlimited, the buyer of an option knows his maximum
exposure at the outset.
For the institutional investor, the advent of Hang Seng Index options may
also be a boon. Many international investors, especially US funds, have
minimum dealing sizes that make trades difficult to execute in Hong Kong.
The reason is much of Hong Kong's stock market listed equity belongs to
family owners or large mainland Chinese investors. Tradeable equity in
Hongkong Telecom is 21.6 per cent of issued capital: in Citic Pacific, 40
per cent: in Hutchison Whampoa, 59 per cent.
If the traded option on the Hang Seng Index is successful, and most think it
will be, then the next step is for individual stock options to be traded.
Last week, both Chicago and New York began trading an option on Hongkong
Telecom's ADRs.
But the futures exchange is not likely to carry trading in stock options
when they appear. That seems likely to be the province of the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange which, as a prelude to trading, will have to repeal the
existing prohibition on 'short selling'.
Currently in Hong Kong, stock options exist in the form of warrants. These
are almost always 'call' options and usually have maturities ranging from
two to five years. The capitalisation of this market is in excess of
HKDollars 25bn.
Analysts believe the covered warrant market - making for nearly 40 per cent
of the Hong Kong futures exchange - is most at risk from the introduction of
stock options.
Says Mr Justin Kennedy, of Warburg Securities: 'Retail investors . . . will
like stock options because they are short-dated, highly geared and extremely
volatile.'

<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese shipbuilder, is to cut its
annual dividend by Y1 to Y3 per share for the year to March 1993 due to a
sharp fall in profits.
Sumitomo also announced a downward revision of its profits forecast. It now
expects non-consolidated pre-tax profits to fall to Y1.5bn (Dollars 12.7m),
down from an earlier estimate of Y3bn. Sales are now projected to total
Y295bn, down from a previous projection of Y300bn.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: New chief at CS First Boston
global bond unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CS FIRST Boston, the New York-based investment banking group, has announced
changes to the management of its global bond business which include the
appointment of a new head of fixed-income sales and trading.
Mr Robert Diamond, formerly chairman and chief executive of CSFB's Pacific
subsidiary in Tokyo, will return to New York to run the bank's entire
fixed-income sales and trading operation, including its Far East business.
He is replacing Mr Thomas Sexton, who has resigned from his post for
'personal reasons'.
At the same time, Mr Robert Baylis, a vice-chairman of the firm, will move
to Hong Kong where he will take over Mr Diamond's old position as head of
the Pacific operating unit.
CSFB said the moves were designed to improve the co-ordination of its global
bond operations.
Mr John Hennessey, the firm's chief executive, said the moves meant CSFB now
'have two of our most senior managers tying together all of our fixed income
businesses on a worldwide basis.'
The changes at the top of CSFB come at a difficult time for First Boston,
the firm's big US subsidiary, which has been hit by some notable staff
defections.
Last week, for example, the head of fixed-income research left CSFB to join
a fund management group, and several other executives in investment banking
and capital markets also moved to other firms.

WOOLWORTH, the general merchandise and specialty store retailer, yesterday
reported after-tax profits of Dollars 280m in the 53 weeks to January 30 - a
considerable improvement on the previous year's Dollars 166m loss. Sales in
the full year and the final quarter were flat.
The 1992-3 profits total was free of any one-off accounting-related or
restructuring charges and came after net profits of Dollars 165m in the
final three months.
The 1991-2 figure included an after-tax restructuring charge of Dollars 250m
 -to cover an accelerated store redeployment programme - and an
accounting-related charge of Dollars 113m. The restructuring charge was
taken in the fourth quarter of 1991-2, when the net loss totalled Dollars
128m. Woolworth said sales in 1992-3 reached Dollars 9.96bn, virtually
unchanged. The fourth-quarter sales figure was Dollars 3.13bn.
The full-year and final-quarter revenues from the specialty stores increased
slightly, while general merchandise revenues showed a small decline.
Woolworth noted that sales figures had been depressed by the store closure
programme, al-though it said this had a positive effect on operating
profits.
In terms of 1992-3 operating results, the specialty stores made a profit of
Dollars 418m, against Dollars 312m in the previous 52-week period. The
general merchandise operations recorded a profit of Dollars 156m, compared
with Dollars 131m.
Tiffany, the upmarket US jewellery retailer, continued to suffer from the
decline in luxury goods spending and a decline in sales to Japan during the
fourth quarter.
It posted final-quarter profits of Dollars 8.66m after tax, down from
Dollars 12.1m in the same period of 1991-2, taking the total for the year to
end-January to Dollars 15.7m, compared with Dollars 25.5m last time.
General Cinema, the investment company whose interests range from publishing
to a majority stake in the Neiman Marcus retail business, announced an
after-tax profit of Dollars 31.8m in the three months to end-January.
This compared with Dollars 407.2m profits figure last time which was scored
after a Dollars 39.2m accounting charge and a Dollars 419.6m extraordinary
gain. Operating profits increased from Dollars 43m to Dollars 45.6m.

NZ subsidiaries

<TEXT>
BRIERLEY Investments yes-terday announced a 25 per cent lift in profits in
the half year to NZDollars 112.7m (USDollars 59.6m), largely due to higher
earnings from its New Zealand subsidiaries.
The chairman, Mr Bob Matthew, said the group's biggest investment, the UK
hotel group Mount Charlotte, in which Brierley Investments has a 70 per cent
interest, recorded a modest profit of Pounds 2.1m (USDollars 3m) after a
substantial loss in the previous year.
UK earnings were NZDollars 5m compared with NZDollars 123m last year which
included the subsequently-sold motor division Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn.
Mr Matthew said while the earnings from Mount Charlotte were clearly an
inadequate return on funds employed, the profit turnround came in the face
of a Pounds 8.8m or 3.9 per cent reduction in turnover. He said the result
reflected improving margins, static operating costs and significantly lower
interest charges.
Brierley Investments also had a profit turnround from its Australian
investments, earning NZDollars 23m against a loss of NZDollars 15m in the
comparable period of 1991. However, it incurred a loss of NZDollars 4m in
the US, against a profit of NZDollars 19m in the previous period. Late last
year the company announced its intention to withdraw from the US.
Profits from its New Zealand operations were NZDollars 189m against
NZDollars 190m. Mr Matthew said trading profits in New Zealand at NZDollars
124m were up NZDollars 18m.

THE PRUDENTIAL, the large US financial institution unrelated to the British
insurer with the same name, yesterday announced that its total capital
increased from Dollars 9.74bn to Dollars 9.82bn in 1992, despite the heavy
claims resulting from Hurricane Andrew.
The Prudential is a mutual insurer - owned by its policyholders rather than
by shareholders - and increases in capital are the closest equivalent to a
conventional profits total.
The company said the net loss from Hurricane Andrew, which devastated
southern Florida in late-August, topped Dollars 900m and that the overall
financial results 'fell well short of goals'. But it described the
performances of its Prudential Securities arm, its home mortgage, group
insurance and asset management businesses as 'vigorous'.
The group's results were also helped by 'substantial' gains in its bond
portfolio. The Prudential said total net capital gains on the investment
side were Dollars 461m last year - reflecting gains on the bond side, offset
by losses on commercial property investments. Consolidated net investment
income of the year overall was unchanged at Dollars 10.3bn. The Prudential's
return on invested assets, meanwhile, fell from 9.3 per cent to 8.8 per
cent, partly due to the declining interest rate environment.
Prudential Securities, the group's Wall Street broking house, reported a 42
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Dollars 221m in the wake of strong
underwriting and retail brokerage businesses.
But after taxes of Dollars 71m, 1992 net income of Dollars 150m was well
down on 1991 when the firm made Dollars 201m after tax benefits of Dollars
45m.
Overall revenues at the securities unit rose 7 per cent to Dollars 2.7bn,
fuelled by an 11 per cent gain in retail broking commissions and what the
firm described as a 'significant increase' in underwriting activity.
Customer assets under management or administration at Prudential Securities
rose 10 per cent last year to Dollars 41.5bn.
The brokerage arm's management also said yesterday that 1993 had started
strongly. January was the firm's third best month ever, said chief executive
Mr Hardwick Simmons.

GENERAL MOTORS' efforts to cut its labour force received a boost yesterday
when the United Auto Workers' union announced that some 16,500 workers had
signed up for a special early retirement programme - far more than
originally expected.
The company, which is trying to reduce its workforce as part of a plan to
return its loss-making North American operations to profit, announced the
early retirement programme last December. The deadline for acceptance was
March 1.
The union originally estimated that some 7,000 workers might accept the
offer.

<TEXT>
SPRECHER &amp; Schuh Holding, the Swiss electrical engineering group, is selling
its low voltage electro-mechanical controls company and the Sprecher &amp; Schuh
name and trademark to Rockwell International of the US.
Terms of the transaction were not revealed, but Mr Hans von Werra, managing
director of the Swiss company, said it was a cash deal. The business
accounted for roughly half of the group's turnover and profit. Turnover in
1991 was SFr494.9m (Dollars 323m).
Mr von Werra said the business, which is active mainly in European markets,
was not large enough to succeed in the future on its own. Attempts to make
an acquisition had failed so the group decided to sell it.
It will become part of Rockwell's Allen-Bradley controls division. Mr Don
Davis, president of Allen-Bradley, said the acquisition would strengthen the
US group's global market position.
The S &amp; S low-voltage control business, with factories in Switzerland,
Italy, the UK and South Africa, will continue under its current management.
Mr Davis foresaw joint development of new products by it and Allen-Bradley.
Mr von Werra said that a condition of the deal was that S &amp; S would change
its name by the end of 1994. The proceeds would go into industrial
investments.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Dutch group aims for a promising
package - Merger has created a new force in the European paper industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOMORROW will witness the emergence of a new player in the European paper
and packaging industry. KNP BT, a product of the merger of Holland's top
three competitors - KNP, Buhrmann-Tetterode and VRG - will have annual sales
of Fl 13bn (Dollars 7.2bn) and fits just behind Stora of Sweden in the
European league.
It will be the EC's leading paper merchant, its leading producer of fine
coated papers, and a dominant player in solid board, used primarily to
package fruit and vegetables.
Though positioned to cash in on any upturn in the unified European market,
KNP BT is emerging in a dismal economic environment. Virtually all players
are suffering from over-capacity and flaccid demand, and it is unclear
whether the current hopeful glimmerings will translate to more vigorous
growth later this year.
In 1992, each of the three partners saw their profits slump, even if none
actually spilled red ink.
Mr Robert van Oordt, the former Buhrmann-Tetterode chairman who is stepping
up to be the new chief, admits he is 'not terribly optimistic about 1993.
Next year might see an upturn.'
KNP BT, whose costs are denominated in 'hard' guilders, 'can never predict
such things as devaluations in Scandinavia or revaluations elsewhere. These
can radically change the business overnight,' Mr van Oordt observes. KNP BT
believes greater diversity through integration will insulate it against
cyclical fluctuations and generate cash-flow sufficient to strengthen the
balance sheet plus finance investments and acquisitions.
The new group has two business arms: KNP and BT's paper and packaging
production, which will be joined into a new Industry operation, and BT and
VRG's complementary activities in office products, graphic paper and
systems, plus information systems, which will be folded into a new trading
and distribution arm.
'If you look carefully . . . a lot of what we do is paper, but certainly not
the majority,' Mr van Oordt says.
Only about 16 per cent of KNP BT's turnover up to the six-month point of
last year came from paper production (roughly one-fifth of total operating
profits); packaging output accounted for a further 30 per cent of sales and
over half of profit.
KNP BT's fine branded papers are under heavy price pressure. Demand - steady
for most grades through much of last year - has been weakening. For all
players, 'the name of the game now is to absorb the excess capacity,' says
Mr van Oordt.
Margins in packaging are also under pressure, although both fine papers and
packaging may be among the first to benefit from any cyclical upswing.
A new strategy will come in the office products market. BT's existing
activity in the US ranks second after Boise-Cascade, with annual sales of
Dollars 420m.
After establishing a strong regional base, BT spread nationwide to form what
today represents one of the new group's few real growth markets. The
ambition is 'to replicate' the achievement in Europe. Mr van Oordt sees
particularly synergies emerging in office products and information services,
using overlapping customer lists to offer complementary services.
At present, office products account for a relatively small slice of the
merged business - 7 per cent of turnover but less of total operating profit.
Nevertheless, Mr van Oordt says, 'we have acquisition plans - very targeted
and focused. You will not see huge investments in capacity or acquisitions
in the next few years, but strategically-placed expansion in areas like
office products, information systems and, possibly, packaging.'
Among the benefits of the merger, Mr van Oordt stresses accelerated
rationalisation above closures, 'better planning of inventories, better
logistics and distribution, better use of existing production capacity.'
The graphic systems division faces stagnant demand and a serious product
overlap. BT sells 25 per cent of the printing machines produced by Germany's
Heidelberger. VRG is a leading agent for MAN Roland.
The new group is thus in the odd and unsustainable position of acting as
exclusive agent for two competing players. 'Obviously very difficult,' says
Mr van Oordt. The EC merger taskforce, in the second phase of investigating
the deal, agrees.
'On the basis of our discussions with . . . Brussels, we've concluded we
will have to make a choice in the Benelux (between Heidelberger and MAN
Roland). We will try to resolve this situation in the first half of this
year.' One resolution may lie in a management buy-out of the VRG/MAN Roland
franchise, analysts suggest.
Another concern lies in paper merchanting, where BT has traditionally traded
on its independence from big suppliers. Will its amalgamation into the new
KNP BT combine prove counter-productive?
'The merchanting arm will have the same independence as before,' insists Mr
van Oordt. 'We will still buy 75 per cent of our paper requirements outside
our own network.'
However, he is careful to add: 'The world moves on. Closer relationships
between suppliers and distributors have become more common . . . than they
used to be.'
Whether the merger will deliver the hoped-for benefits remains unclear.
Among the outstanding concerns is the clash of personalities and management
styles involved in joining three former competitors.
However, coming when the likes of truckmaker Daf, electronics giant Philips
and aircraft producer Fokker are either drastically scaling down or falling
prey to foreign buyers, the KNP BT merger has the important domestic virtue
of being a uniquely 'Dutch solution'.

FT  04 MAR 93 / N American groups to link fertiliser interests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMINCO, the Vancouver-based mining group, and Alberta Energy Company of
Calgary plan to combine their fertiliser interests in a new publicly-listed
company.
The entity, to be called Cominco Fertilizers, will be among North America's
biggest integrated fertiliser producers, with annual output of 1.6m tonnes
of nitrogen products and over 1m tonnes of potash.
Cominco Fertilizers plans to raise about CDollars 100m (USDollars 79m)
through an initial public offering, which is expected to be priced in early
April. Following the share issue, Cominco will have a 50 per cent interest
in Cominco Fertilizers and Alberta Energy 10 per cent.
The two companies are partners in several nitrogen plants and distribution
facilities in western Canada and the mid-west US. But the growth of the
fertiliser business has had to take a back seat in recent years to Cominco's
efforts to turn around its lossmaking, and much bigger, mining and metals
division.
The creation of a separate unit and the infusion of new equity is expected
to broaden the horizons of the fertiliser unit. Cominco said that Cominco
Fertilizers 'is examining a number of expansion and growth opportunities'.
A Cominco official said yesterday the spin-off would also have the benefit
of turning Cominco into a pure mineral exploration, mining and metals
processing company. Cominco's fertiliser division posted operating earnings
of CDollars 29.1m in 1992 on sales of CDollars 355m.

DEBT issued by four holding companies in the Bronfman business empire has
been downgraded to below investment grade by Canada's Dominion Bond Rating
Service.
DBRS said the downgrade, which affects Brascan, Hees International Bancorp,
Trilon Financial Corp and Great Lakes Power, reflected the inability of
companies in the Bronfman group to raise new debt or equity.
The rating on Brascan's senior debt has been cut to BBB High from A Low.
Hees' senior-debt rating has dropped to BBB from A High. Trilon is down to
BBB from A. The rating on Great Lakes' commercial paper has fallen to R-2
High from R-1 Low.

ORKLA, the Norwegian group with interests ranging from paper to food and
drinks, saw 1992 pre-tax profits almost halve after a write-down on the
group's shareholdings and heavy securities losses. The profit plunged to
NKr315m (Dollars 45.19m) from NKr608m a year earlier.
Orkla was forced to write down by NKr656m its shareholdings in Elkem, the
troubled Norwegian light metals producer, and Uni Storebrand, Norway's
biggest insurer. Orkla has a 30 per cent stake in Elkem and had 4 per cent
of Uni's shares before the insurer collapsed last autumn.
It also suffered securities losses of NKr381m in 1992, against gains of
NKr262m in 1991.
However, operations performed strongly with sales increasing by 4 per cent
to NKr16.8bn last year from NKr16.1bn a year earlier.
Group operating profit increased by 37 per cent to NKr1.2bn in 1992 from
NKr870m in 1991.
The board proposed leaving the dividend payment unchanged at NKr3.75.
Orkla's A shares rose NKr3 to close at NKr190.50 on the Oslo bourse as its B
shares advanced NKr4 to NKr191.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: VW steps up the pressure on
suppliers - Kevin Done talks to Volkswagen group executives about the plan
to cut its uncompetitive cost base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VOLKSWAGEN group, Europe's leading carmaker, is applying heavy pressure
on its components suppliers to cut their prices sharply.
Audi, the group's executive and luxury car division, and Seat, the group's
Spanish subsidiary, have written to suppliers demanding a 5 per cent cut in
prices in 1993.
Mr Daniel Goeudevert, deputy chairman of the Volkswagen group and chairman
of the VW volume car division, said that in some cases the VW division was
seeking even more substantial concessions from suppliers.
'Maybe we need even more than 5 per cent at VW. We are talking to each of
our suppliers. Sometimes we are seeking cuts of 3 or 5 or 10 per cent. It
depends on the product and its history.'
Mr Erich Schmitt, Audi director of purchasing, said the group had set the
goal of reducing the prices of components purchased from outside suppliers
by 25 to 30 per cent over the next four to five years, helped by
efficiencies from the introduction of new model generations.
The Volkswagen group's belated drive to cut its uncompetitive cost base is
creating upheaval both internally and among its German supply base. Audi
components purchases from outside the group total around DM7bn (Dollars
4.2bn), while Volkswagen division purchases in Europe total around DM15bn.
The group has fallen far behind its rivals in reforming its crucial
relations with suppliers. Mr Schmitt said that the number of the group's
suppliers would have to be sharply reduced with Audi seeking to cut the
number of its first tier suppliers from 900 at present to only 300 to 400
over the next five years.
The group was seeking to cut its costly dependence on German-based
suppliers. Around 90 per cent of Audi purchases were still made in Germany
'We want to start real global sourcing,' said Mr Schmitt.
Mr Goeudevert admitted that the Volkswagen group was lagging seriously
behind its competitors. 'Everyone in the industry knows that Volkswagen has
a cost problem. We must reduce dramatically our cost structures in the next
12 to 18 months. We have two years.'
Mr Goeudevert warned that Volkswagen was forecasting a drop of 20 to 22 per
cent in new car sales in Germany in 1993 and a fall of 10 to 15 per cent in
new car sales across west Europe. 'We have two main ambitions. Cost, cost,
cost, to lower the break-even level, and quality. There will be no
concessions on quality. We must leave for a while the dedication to
improving sales volumes year by year. This will be the dedication of
management in the next two years,' he said.
With its profits plummeting and probably the worst cost structure of any of
the volume carmakers in Europe, Volkswagen is facing a period of daunting
upheaval to close the gap on its rivals.
A further shake-up of the group's top management is expected to be announced
later this month by Mr Ferdinand Piech, who took over as chairman of the VW
group management board at the beginning of January.
Speculation persists that Mr Piech is still trying to recruit Mr Ignacio
Lopez de Arriortua, the head of global purchasing at General Motors and the
man credited with giving GM Europe the most competitive purchasing cost base
of any of Europe's volume carmakers.
Mr Goeudevert said the VW division was pursuing a 12-point programme to cut
its costs including a sharp reduction in the workforce, cuts in materials
purchasing costs and lower capital investment, with the delay of some key
projects such as the completion of the second stage of a new integrated car
plant at Mosel in eastern Germany.
Job reductions were being brought forward with the aim of cutting 12,500
jobs in the VW volume car division in Germany in the two years 1993-94.
Originally, these cuts were to have been spread over five years.
Mr Goeudevert warned that if new car sales in Germany and west Europe
declined even more sharply than currently forecast 'then we must look at a
new job reduction programme.'
'We are going to reduce output in line with the falling market. We expect to
keep our market share where it was,' he said. VW is carrying excess car
stocks.
VW is cutting 18 production days in the first quarter and 13 in the second
quarter of 1993 with the aim of reducing output by 160,000 cars in the first
six months.
Expenditure by the group on its automotive operations was being reduced to
DM46bn in the five years from 1993 to 1997 from DM51bn previously planned
from 1992 to 1996.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Groupe Suez pushed to first loss
by provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   Paris
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROUPE SUEZ, the French financial and industrial conglomerate, yesterday
estimated it lost between FFr1.8bn (Dollars 323m) and FFr1.9bn net last
year, its first-ever deficit, due to heavier-than-expected provisions on
property holdings.
The loss, the most dramatic evidence yet of the impact of the Parisian
property crisis on French financial institutions, represents a FFr5.7bn
swing from a FFr3.8bn net profit in 1991.
However, Mr Gerard Worms, chairman, said Suez should make a profit this
year, now that the heavy provisions were behind it, and would therefore
maintain its dividend at the 1991 level. 'The good ship Suez has endured a
storm but has not given up to the waters,' he said. Property losses and
provisions accounted for FFr4.2bn of the change, he said. By the end of last
year, provisions covered 19 per cent of group lending to the property
industry.
Mr Worms had earlier warned that Suez would produce the worst results in its
135-year history, but this was well below market expectations of a FFr500m
to FFr1bn net profit for 1992.
Mr David Harrington, general market analyst at James Capel in Paris, said:
'The group has had one problem after another. There must be a lot of red
faces at Suez.'
The loss showed lack of control on property investment over the past decade,
said another analyst.
On top of this came FFr800m of provisions for the fall in value of the
group's equity investments, plus FFr700m for the effect of the economic
downturn on the group's operating results.
The group is supporting its banking subsidiaries affected by the property
crisis, such as Banque Indosuez, its main banking unit, which has received
FFr800m in fresh equity from its parent last December.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: French group sets out to bid for
medicine wholesaler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRENCH consortium which includes Rhone-Poulenc, the country's biggest
chemicals group, is attempting to raise between FFr1.5bn (Dollars 269m) and
FFr2.5bn to make a counter-bid for Office Commercial Pharmaceutique,
France's biggest medicines wholesaler.
Its aim is to outbid Gehe, Germany's second-largest wholesaler, which last
month announced a friendly takeover of OCP for FFr800 a share, valuing the
company at FFr1.8bn. A takeover by Gehe would form Europe's largest drugs
wholesaling company with sales of around DM14bn a year.
The consortium, which includes a number of leading French investment banks
and drugs groups, has been pulled together by Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the
French industry minister. The Bourely family, which owns 15 per cent of OCP
and is the group's largest shareholder, is understood to oppose the German
takeover.
Mr Dieter Kammerer, vice-president of Gehe, said he was shocked by the
intervention of the government and pharmaceuticals groups. He said there was
no industrial logic for drugs companies to be involved in wholesaling.
Mr Jean-Pierre Duche, OCP chief executive, supports the deal. Under the
agreement OCP management would control the German group's wholesaling
operations which represent 80 per cent of its turn-over.
However, French pharmaceuticals groups are reluctant to join the consortium.
Mr Jean-Paul Leon, Elf-Sanofi's chief financial officer, said the company
had no interest in promoting or participating in such a consortium.
Rhone-Poulenc said it was not interested in taking over OCP on its own and
would not take a significant stake. Both said wholesaling did not represent
a core business.
The Gehe takeover was given the go-ahead this week by the Paris bourse. It
is awaiting permission from Commission d'Operations de Bourse, the stock
exchange regulatory body, and the French ministry of finance.
The takeover was expected to have been completed by the end of the month.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Mazda and Ford end venture talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   Geneva
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MAZDA and Ford, the Japanese and US motor groups, have abandoned their
negotiations to set up joint vehicle production in Europe.
The breakdown of the talks is a serious setback to Mazda, which is left as
the only one of the top five Japanese carmakers without a production base in
Europe.
Nissan, Toyota and Honda have developed their first European car assembly
plants in the UK, while Mitsubishi is developing a joint car production
venture with Volvo in the Netherlands.
Mazda and Ford, which owns a 25 per cent stake in the Japanese carmaker,
have studied a wide range of possible joint car projects for Europe, but
Mazda said yesterday the talks had been discontinued 'for the time being'.
The fruitless negotiations with Ford of Europe have lasted nearly four years
and followed abortive talks with Saab, the Swedish carmaker.
Mazda said yesterday that 'local sourcing' in Europe remained 'an important
strategic consideration.'
Mazda now planned to intensify its examination of options without Ford of
Europe. 'We will be stepping up our studies of possible co-operative
ventures with other European manufacturers. We would like to resolve the
situation as soon as possible.'
It refused to comment on earlier reports that it had held talks with
Chausson, the French automotive engineering group.
Ford said the talks with Mazda had been terminated because of 'concerns
about the potential profitability of a co-operative European venture. We
could not establish mutually acceptable economic results for a joint
project.'
Mazda's failure to develop a European production base will act as a serious
brake on its growth in Europe during the remainder of the 1990s.
Without local production it will be unable easily to circumvent the quota
restrictions on direct exports from Japan to the European Community, which
are scheduled to last to the end of the decade.
Brussels is already pushing Japan to cut its export shipments to the EC this
year in light of the steep decline forecast in new car demand.
Tokyo and Brussels are in conflict over the interpretation of the
understanding reached in 1991 over the development of Japanese car sales in
Europe during the seven-year transition to a free market in 2000. Tokyo  -
together with the UK government  - insist that local Japanese vehicle
production in Europe is not included under the agreed ceilings for direct
exports and the system for monitoring these shipments.
Mazda is also studying the shipment of cars to Europe from its joint venture
assembly plant with Ford in the US.

FT  04 MAR 93 / International Company News: Investor declines to SKr1.48bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   Stockholm
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTOR, the Swedish Wallenberg family's main holding company, saw income
after financial items fall to SKr1.48bn (Dollars 191m) in 1992 from
SKr2.16bn a year earlier. This follows a drop in capital gains and a worse
performance from Saab-Scania, its wholly-owned vehicle and aerospace unit.
However, the group benefited from a 26 per cent increase in the value of its
share portfolio to SKr23.3bn  - at a time when the Stockholm bourse fell 1
per cent  - and from a 22 per cent rise in net worth to SKr32.4bn.
The dividend was held at SKr5.25 per share.
Operating income after depreciation fell to SKr3.64bn from SKr5.05bn. This
reflected a drop in dividends received to SKr546m from SKr685m and capital
gains of SKr2.27bn against SKr2.61bn.
Saab-Scania's operating income after depreciation also worsened to SKr1.23bn
from SKr1.70bn, largely because of more difficult industry conditions for
the company's trucks and buses unit.
Sales at Saab-Scania fell 10 per cent to SKr27bn from SKr30bn and income
after financial items dropped to SKr716m from SKr889m. Orders rose strongly
to SKr36bn from SKr28bn, mainly due to JAS39 fighter aircraft orders.
Scania Trucks and Buses posted an 8 per cent fall in sales to SKr16.55bn.
The Saab-Scania figures reflect the financial integration of Saab-Scania
Holdings and Saab-Scania AB. They no longer reflect the group's 50 per cent
stake in Saab Automobile, which last week separately reported a SKr2.69bn
1992 loss, as this is no longer consolidated.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Savage shows 19% advance and expands in
shelving
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAVAGE GROUP, the USM-quoted hardware supplier, reported profits up 19 per
cent in the six months to December 31. Turnover on continuing operations
dipped 4.2 per cent to Pounds 32.3m.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.04m, up from Pounds 874,000 on
continuing operations last time. Last year's result excluded losses of
Pounds 198,000 on discontinued businesses. The outcome was struck after
reduced interest payments of Pounds 538,000 (Pounds 746,000).
Earnings per share were 0.7p, against losses of 0.3p; an interim dividend of
0.25p (nil) is declared.
The group also announced the acquisition of Strongbeam, a supplier of fixed
shelving, for Pounds 900,000. Strongbeam had turnover of Pounds 1.5m last
year.
A placing of 1.9m shares at 46p, equal to 5 per cent of the share capital,
raised Pounds 864,000 net. Proceeds will be used to help pay for Strongbeam
and to fund investment in shelving manufacture.
Mr Tony Philipson, chief executive, said UK business remained 'very
difficult, with no tangible signs of recovery', but all overseas businesses
increased sales and made profits, after several years of losses.

<TEXT>
THE Irish government confirmed yesterday that it had received an offer from
Archer Daniels Midland, the US agriculture conglomerate, for its remaining
30.4 per cent stake in Greencore, the Irish sugar and foods company, but
appears to have bowed to political pressure in throwing open the stake to
other offers until March 24.
Greencore's shares resumed trading yesterday, closing at 269p up 24p from
their suspension price.
Mr Joe Walsh, the agriculture minister, said yesterday 'We will have to
await the price which any company is prepared to pay for the shares, and
then (consider) the strategic long-term interest .. We are giving an
opportunity to Irish companies particularly to make a bid for this remaining
stake, because the only interest shown so far is that of ADM'.
He said there has been interest by some Irish companies 'but the only
precise bid' had been made by ADM. 'We have an offer on the table of 260p
per share, but that is a once-off sale, and that is not what the government
is interested in.'

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pacific sales help Linx edge ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DRAMATIC sales increase in the Pacific region helped Linx Printing
Technologies, the maker of continuous ink jet printers, edge ahead in its
first six months as a quoted company.
The group suffered a significant loss of gross margin, mainly due to launch
costs of the 6000 series printer and its delayed introduction in the US.
Pre-tax profits increased to Pounds 763,000 on sales of Pounds 5.75m in the
six months to December 31.
Earnings per share fell from 3.88p to 3.7p, reflecting the increased number
of shares in issue following the flotation.
A first interim dividend of 0.35p is declared.
The 6000 printer is expected to produce a 15 per cent increase in gross
margin over the 5000 series and should account for 50 per cent of sales in
the second half.
The group finished the period with net cash, but has not excluded the
possibility of gearing up.
Sales in Europe, including the UK, rose 4 per cent to Pounds 3.97m, with
strong growth in France and Italy and slower progress in Germany and the UK.
North American sales increased 9 per cent to Pounds 612,000, but the rest of
the world jumped to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 541,000) with Japan particularly
strong.
Sales to Germany and Japan now each account for about 20 per cent of the
total and the US accounts for about 10 per cent, without the benefit of any
significant sales of the 6000 series printer.
Mr Derek Harris, chairman, said there would also be scope for increasing
margin with the production of ink from Linx own plant and the introduction
of environment friendly ink
COMMENT
Linx provided few deviations from expectations. Falls in margin are
explainable and should be more than reversed with the introduction the 6000
series printer. On the plus side, fears of an over-dependence on Germany
should subside as rapid growth in the Pacific region reduces dependence on
Europe. Earnings should grow 20 per cent a year for the next two years and
there is scope for more growth in market share, particularly as US General
Electric's Videojet is now at a relative currency disadvantage. That said,
Linx is probably fully valued. Pre-tax profits should be Pounds 2.2m for the
year, giving 10.2p of earnings and a prospective multiple of about 18 that
is at the correct premium to the market.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Panel tightens rule on 'creeping control'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAKEOVER Panel has tightened its rule on 'creeping control'. With effect
from yesterday morning, when the announcement was made, the owner of between
30 and 50 per cent of the voting rights of a company can only buy a further
1 per cent in any 12 month period.
Previously the limit was 2 per cent.
The change to Rule 9.1(b) of the Takeover Code has been under discussion for
many months and the Panel said yesterday that the arguments on each side had
been finely balanced.
It concluded that 'the interests of shareholders would be best served' by
cutting the purchasing freedom to 1 per cent.
The Panel's concern was that the rule could be abused by a predator which
could gradually increase its stake and gain control without making a full
bid.
However, it also felt that some flexibility was still needed in Rule 9.
Complaints about the rule are rare, the Panel said.
The rule was introduced in 1974 as part of the mandatory offer rule, under
which a bid is required if a stake of 30 per cent or more is acquired.
Originally the limit on purchases was 1 per cent but it was increased to 2
per cent in 1976.
The Panel said it could not recall a case where a predator had acquired
control of a company using this rule.
The closest that a company has come to be acquired this way was Molins, the
engineering company. Leucadia National Corporation, a US group, failed in a
takeover bid for Molins in May 1990, but retained a 45.14 per cent stake
afterwards.
It subsequently bought shares taking its stake to 48.45 per cent. However,
an attempt in October 1991 to use its votes to gain control of the board
failed and Leucadia then sold its shares.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Knitwear merger at Grampian
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAMPIAN Holdings, the Scottish mini-conglomerate, is merging Pitlochry
Knitwear, its knitwear retail subsidiary, with the privately-owned Edinburgh
Woollen Mill.
Under the deal Grampian will own 25 per cent of EWM, a retailing company
with turnover of Pounds 58m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m in the year to
January 31.
Pitlochry achieved sales of Pounds 23m and pre-tax profit of Pounds 600,000
in the 12 months to end-December.
The enlarged EWM will have 200 retail units in the UK, of which 89 are in
Scotland, and should produce combined turnover of more than Pounds 90m in
the current financial year.
Both Grampian and EWM's main shareholders have agreed that they intend
ultimately to float the company.
Mr Bill Hughes, Grampian chairman, said that the two businesses would
combine EWM's strong high street presence with Pitlochry's larger
out-of-town units.
EWM has demerged its manufacturing operations from its retail side, while
Pitlochry closed most of its manufacturing and has transferred the remainder
to EWM under a separate deal.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Cowie buoyed by fleet leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH in fleet leasing helped T Cowie, the motor group, to increase
pre-tax profit by 34 per cent to Pounds 24.3m last year.
The rise, from Pounds 18.2m, was ahead of expectations and the share price
gained 14p to 211p.
Mr Gordon Hodgson, chief executive, said the group aimed to double its
dealership network and to increase its leasing fleet from 60,000 to 100,000
vehicles - probably in that order.
Cowie retains a 9.9 per cent stake in Henlys following the failure of its
Pounds 32m hostile bid in September. The holding has been written down to
60p a share.
Group turnover of Pounds 605.9m (Pounds 564.9m) was pushed ahead by Royscot,
the contract hire business acquired from Royal Bank of Scotland late in
1991.
Mr Neil Pykett, managing director of Cowie Interleasing, said economies of
scale and correct gauging of residual values lay behind the divisional
profit rise to Pounds 16.6m (Pounds 11m) on turnover of Pounds 245m (Pounds
208.8m).
The motor dealing division suffered a squeeze on margins that reduced
profits to Pounds 5.48m (Pounds 6.6m) on flat sales of Pounds 316.3m.
Sir Tom Cowie, chairman, said Black Wednesday had induced a state of
'hysteria' in the used car market. In October and November, monthly price
falls amounted to about Pounds 300 per vehicle. The good news was that
things had improved since December because of the underlying shortage of
quality used cars.
Profits rose to Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.23m) in the London Grey-Green bus and
coach operation. Bus and coach distribution increased profits to Pounds
1.75m (Pounds 835,000).
Net debt fell from Pounds 355m to Pounds 309m, gearing of 306 per cent. Mr
Hodgson said this should seen against an 'income stream of Pounds 460m going
into 1993'.
Interest costs were flat at Pounds 36.2m, but a Pounds 3m to Pounds 4m gain
from reduced rates was expected this year.
Fully diluted earnings per share rose to 13.31p (11.11p). A final dividend
of 4.25p makes a total of 6.25p (4.875).
COMMENT
Cowie took a bow for being the first motor trader to restore pre-tax profits
to somewhere near the 1988 peak of Pounds 25.8m. This year it is forecast to
set a new record of Pounds 28m-Pounds 30m. But that may turn out to be an
academic figure if it fulfils predictions and makes a significant
acquisition in the meantime. The Henlys experience has left it reluctant to
mount another hostile bid. With its share price shooting up by nearly 100p
since September, it will be keen to use its paper either directly or
indirectly. It may, for instance, go for the motor business of a
conglomerate or a bank and make use of a vendor share placing. A prospective
p/e of little more than 12 puts it at a discount to the market. The debt
risk associated with Cowie is much diminished and it remains worth holding
for its prospects both of further profits recovery and of growth by
acquisition.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Australian investment group lifts stake in
Towles to 51.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONDON CITY Equities, the investment group based in Sydney, Australia, has
increased its stake in Towles, the UK textiles group from 45 to 51.4 per
cent.
LCE has no seat on the board and the majority stake gives it only 13.9 per
cent of the votes.
The group said it had repeatedly sought boardroom representation but this
had been denied by shareholders of the Midlands-based group.
LCE said Towles directors owned 18.8 per cent of the equity and had 41 per
cent of the votes. Towles said the directors had a holding approaching half
of the voting ordinary shares.
At the 1990 annual meeting, a resolution to elect Mr Peter Murray, LCE
chairman, to the board was defeated.
LCE, whose market capitalisation is Pounds 2m, has been buying mainly
non-voting shares in Towles, which has a market capitalisation of less than
Pounds 5m and made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 1,000 in 1991-92.
The Australian group began acquiring shares in 1987 because it thought
Towles was asset rich and cash poor. The recent purchases comprised 168,081
A ordinary shares, which carry no votes, at 90p each.
Apart from pinning his hopes on a proposed European Community directive on
non-voting shares - Mr Murray said it would guarantee one-share-one-vote -
he does not have any firm strategy for securing influence.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Altus maintains stance on Costain purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALTUS FINANCE, the French bank, yesterday said it wanted to continue with
its Dollars 245m (Pounds 172.5m) purchase of the Australian mining interests
of Costain, the UK construction group, in the hope of a successful appeal
against a court injunction blocking the deal.
Costain agreed to sell the mine last year to Altus, a subsidiary of Credit
Lyonnais, the state-owned bank.
However, the transaction hit trouble when Peabody, the US coal subsidiary of
Hanson, obtained an injunction against the sale on grounds that Costain had
allegedly agreed to sell its Australian mines to Peabody for Dollars 200m,
much less than Altus is prepared to pay.
An Altus director said the French group had a binding contract for the
purchase, with agreements from both sets of shareholders and the Australian
authorities.
Costain has appealed against the injunction, granted by a US court last
month.
Altus is waiting for the result of Costain's appeal, likely by the end of
March, before deciding on the next step.
'We are awaiting the result and do not wish to interfere in a matter in
which we have no say. This is between Costain and the judge. It is a complex
issue,' the company said.

FT  04 MAR 93 / Drayton Asia Trust restates net asset value
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING A request for clarification from the Panel on Takeovers and
Mergers, Drayton Asia Trust, the target of a bid from EFM Dragon, has
accepted that the use of third-party estimates - the Financial Times - for
its net asset value was inappropriate.
On February 23 Drayton said its undiluted net asset value of 128.19p for
February 22 was calculated from the (FT-derived) diluted net asset value of
123.5p, adjusted to reflect the non-exercise of the Drayton Asia warrants.
Drayton has subsequently revised its estimate of the diluted net asset value
for February 22 to 123.19p, giving an undiluted estimate of 127.82p after
adjustment.
Further, it said that if the unconditional offer date had been February 22
the share offer would have been 6.7 Dragon shares for each Drayton. On this
basis Drayton's NAV would have been 121.27p, or 94.9 per cent of its
undiluted value at February 22.
'Based on the middle market price of the EFM Dragon ordinary shares of
17.75p on February 22 1993,' Drayton added, 'the market value of the share
offer was 118.93p, representing 93 per cent of Drayton Asia's undiluted
NAV.'

<TEXT>
Allied Irish Banks' profits in the Republic of Ireland, reported in
Wednesday's FT, should have read IPounds 76.7m (Pounds 78.2m) and not
IPounds 72.7m. On an annualised basis this gives a 15.7 per cent downturn
compared to 1991-92, not 20 per cent.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trans World back in the black
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANS WORLD Communications, the Salford based independent radio station
operator, swung from losses of Pounds 1.83m to pre-tax profit of Pounds
1.13m for the year to end-December.
The figure for the previous year, restated from a loss of Pounds 1.15m to
meet FRS 3 accounting rules, included a Pounds 680,000 charge for closing a
subsid-iary.
The improved performance was mainly due to a rise in sales which pushed the
USM-quoted group's turnover up from Pounds 11.4m to Pounds 12.1m.
Dividends are being resumed for the first time in three years via a final of
0.8p out of earnings per share of 3.1p (losses 7p).
Investment in promotion and marketing helped the company push up prices.
Airtime sales rose by 3 per cent from Pounds 9.6m to Pounds 9.9m despite a
drop in the number of advertisers.
The group should benefit further when the advertising market picks up.
There are no borrowings. All four radio stations showed an improvement.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Slimdown pays off with Pounds 11m at Brent
Chemicals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRENT Chemicals International, the speciality chemicals group, more than
doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 11.5m in 1992.
Sales rose from Pounds 100m to Pounds 119.8m.
The company said the profits figure was 37 per cent up on the previous year,
after allowing for heavy rationalisation and redundancy costs incurred in
1991.
Lord Lane of Horsell, chairman, said that while the results benefited from
the inclusion of recent acquisitions and a Pounds 15.6m rights issue in
1991, they were firmly supported by organic growth of 5 per cent in sales
and 12 per cent in profits.
Brent's packaging and graphic arts group, focused mainly on food packaging,
lifted sales by 9 per cent and profits by 20 per cent organically. The
division's actual trading profits rose from Pounds 2.42m to Pounds 4.91m.
Trading profits from the industrial, aerospace and electronics sector rose
from Pounds 3.4m to Pounds 7.5m. This division was affected by recession in
the European Community, but a strong performance in North America and
south-east Asia increased profits by 6 per cent organically.
Lord Lane said: 'During 1992 we improved our gross margins due to
manufacturing efficiencies and cost savings, and we continued to exercise
strict overhead controls. The reduction in staff levels and the streamlining
of our management structure initiated in 1991 have proved their worth.'
Brent said it continued to develop Hebro Chemie, the German metal finishing
business it acquired at the end of 1991. Sales expanded by 8 per cent, but
profits remained static.
Earnings jumped to 10p (2.9p). A maintained final dividend of 5.8p gives a
total of 7.4p (7.34p).

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Yorkshire Foods set for market via Pounds
15m placing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE FOODS is coming to the stock market through a Pounds 15m placing
which will value the Bradford-based food processing company at Pounds 37.5m.
A total of 13.64m shares will be placed at 110p. On the basis of fully-taxed
pro-forma earnings of 7.2p, that puts the shares on an historic multiple of
15.3p.
Net assets per share were 62.4p as at December 31. Dealings are expected to
begin on March 9.
The company was founded by Mr Mike Firth, chairman and chief executive, and
has expanded by buying from Berisford International businesses which process
and package dried fruit and nuts.
Yorkshire Foods made an operating profit of Pounds 3.87m in 1992 on sales of
Pounds 63.2m. The company said that trading in the current year had started
well.
The placing, sponsored by Panmure Gordon, will raise Pounds 12m of new
money. After the payment of expenses and redemption of certain classes of
preference shares, it will provide Pounds 7.3m additional working capital
for the group.
The company's aim is to build a large food manufacturing group, and it is
likely to make further purchases soon.

FT  04 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Courtaulds Textiles hits Pounds 39m and
cash flow strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS Textiles yesterday reported a rise in pre-tax profits of almost
90 cent last year from Pounds 20.7m to Pounds 39.1m.
The company, however, warned that comparisons with 1991 figures had been
distorted by the introduction of the new FRS 3 accounting standard.
This meant that provisions against discontinued businesses previously taken
below the line had been deducted from the published 1991 pre-tax figure of
Pounds 42.2m.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive, said that pre-tax profits comparisons,
using the previous accounting basis, were static. Operating profits on the
continuing businesses were 7 per cent lower at Pounds 42.9m on group
turnover 3.5 per cent lower at Pounds 889.6m.
The share price rose 3p to 593p following the announcement of a 9.2p final
dividend, making a total for the year of 13.6p (13p).
Earnings of 30.1p compared with a restated figure of 11.2p.
Mr Taylor said that net cash flow during 1992 had remained strong at Pounds
33m (Pounds 38.7m). It had allowed the group to further reduce net
borrowings to Pounds 17.7m at the year end, equivalent to less than 7 per
cent of shareholders' funds of Pounds 264m.
He said that it was more realistic to look at average monthly borrowings
which were Pounds 72.6m in 1992, still 35 per cent lower at constant
exchange rates than during 1991.
Mr Taylor added that the trading outlook remained mixed. Consumer confidence
appeared to have stopped falling in the UK, which accounted for 60 per cent
of Courtaulds' sales.
The decline in sterling, since the currency departed the ERM last autumn,
would make the company's products more competitive against imports from the
Far East.
The US market was also showing tentative signs of recovery but the lace
market was likely to remain difficult.
Continental Europe, which accounted for about 20 per cent of group sales,
was likely to remain weak - particularly in France and Germany where retail
markets were under severe pressure.
The company yesterday announced purchases worth Pounds 7m, increasing the
scale of its investment in joint ventures in Spain and Thailand.
COMMENT
The company's share price has more than doubled since textiles demerged from
Courtaulds' chemical business three years ago. The management during that
time has achieved substantial success in lowering gearing and overheads and
raising productivity. The result has been to underpin profits in dreadful
trading conditions. These appear at last to be moving in Courtaulds' favour.
UK and US markets are looking better while sterling's devaluation makes
British exports more attractive. The group says that prices of imported
materials and components have risen relatively little because of the poor
market in continental Europe. Forecast profits of between Pounds 47m and
Pounds 50m for the current year put the company on a prospective p/e of more
than 16, on an increased tax charge of about 25 per cent. The company may be
about to reap some reward, but this appears to have been already recognised
in the share price.
