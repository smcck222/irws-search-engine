FT  03 MAR 93 / World Trade News: EC and Japan fail to agree car quotas -
Political solution on exports 'now more likely'

THE EC and Japan failed to agree on quotas for Japanese car exports to the
EC, after two days of negotiations which closed in Tokyo yesterday.
The failure to reach an agreement increases the possibility that the
negotiations on whether Japan should reduce its car exports to the EC, and
to what extent, might be settled by a 'political' solution, according to an
official of the EC Commission.
'There is a recognition on the two sides that 1993 will be a year of
contraction of the EC automobile and light commercial vehicle market,' Mr
Robert Verrue, director in charge of the internal market and general affairs
at the Commission, said in Tokyo yesterday.
The EC and Japan have agreed to monitor Japanese vehicle exports to the EC
to pave the way for a smooth transition to unrestricted exports by the year
2000. Until then a quota based on the outlook for the EC vehicle market
would be used to restrict Japanese exports to the EC.
However, the two sides have not been able to agree on the outlook for demand
in 1993. The EC has said demand in the European market would fall
considerably from 1992, while Japan had, until recently, been forecasting
that the EC market would expand in 1993.
Japan now accepts that demand will fall this year, but the EC, which in
December had forecast a decline of about 2.6 per cent in registrations, now
believes it will fall even further, by 4-6 per cent.
The EC's stance is that since market demand is falling Japan should share
the burden of cutting supply by reducing the level of its exports from 1.19m
units in 1992. 'Otherwise we would fear that markets would be under strains
and sometimes under excessive strains,' Mr Verrue said.
There is disagreement, in particular, on the forecast for the German market,
which because of its size would have a considerable impact on the overall
quota.
The Commission was careful to emphasise that while it took into account all
factors, including the level of Japanese local production in the EC, in
arriving at a market forecast, the negotiations with Japan on a quota
concerned Japanese exports alone and not cars made in the EC.
As a result of the failure of the talks, the two sides will meet again,
possibly within the month, to continue their talks, but Mr Verrue emphasised
that there was likely to be only one more meeting.
The state of the vehicle market in 1993 was expected to be so bad that
unless agreement was reached 'the way the burden would be shared. . . would
in the end be subject to a political decision,' Mr Verrue said.

FT  03 MAR 93 / World Trade News: US 'in no hurry' over China talks
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA and the US made some progress this week in talks on terms for China's
entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but accord remains a
'long way off,' according to the chief US negotiator.
Mr Douglas Newkirk, assistant US trade representative for Gatt, said after
two days of talks that China had stepped back from previous understandings
on entry terms for the world's fair trade regime.
Among these sticking points is China's apparent unwillingness to accept a
safeguards system to prevent such developments as sudden surges in exports
that might swamp the domestic markets of Gatt signatories. China is also
lukewarm about committing itself to a full market economy as an eventual
goal.
Mr Newkirk said that before formal negotiations were suspended in 1989 -
talks were frozen in protest at the army crackdown on pro-democracy
activists - China had agreed to both the safeguards and market economy
provisions. Discussions this week also focused on US demands that China
commit itself to a single national trade regime, full transparency in the
publication of its trading regulations and the gradual elimination of
non-tariff barriers.
Western officials say that China has made significant progress in
liberalising trade policies, but much more needs to be done to improve
market access for foreign business. They see the Gatt negotiations as a
useful device to push the Chinese to go further.
Mr Newkirk said the US was 'not in any hurry' to conclude an agreement.
'We're prepared to go as fast or as slow as they're prepared to go,' he
declared. The US made it clear that that unconditional Most Favoured Nation
status for China was non-negotiable. The US government is obliged by
Congress to review China's human rights record each year before granting
MFN.
The US official's predictions of slow progress towards Gatt accession for
China are likely to disappoint and frustrate Chinese officials who had been
predicting an early agreement.

<TEXT>
NBC News yesterday announced the resignation of its president, Mr Michael
Gartner, in an attempt to limit damage to the news division of America's
third-ranking television network from the rigging of a broadcast test of a
General Motors truck last year.
Mr Gartner, president of the division since 1988, said he told NBC late last
year of his plans to leave in August. He said he had hastened his departure
announcement because of recent controversies.
In November, NBC's Dateline current affairs programme aired pictures of a
blazing GM truck without telling its 11m viewers that it had attached small
incendiary devices to the truck to make it burst into flames during a
collision.
In February, NBC issued an on-air apology to GM, America's biggest carmaker,
after it launched a suit for defamation against the network. GM is
struggling against bad publicity over the safety of its C/K pick-up trucks
built between 1973 and 1987, which have been the subject of lawsuits and
government investigations.
An internal investigation of the GM affair is expected to be completed this
week. Mr Don Browne, NBC News executive vice-president, will assume Mr
Gartner's responsibilities while the network searches for a successor.
This is not the only search going on at NBC. The network's parent, General
Electric, is believed to be interested in selling NBC if it can get the
right price.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Tunisia pulls off an economic turnaround: But President Ben
Ali faces a demanding test of his skills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS GHILES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN sharp contrast to its neighbours, Tunisia has quietly and steadily pulled
off an economic turnaround in the last six years.
But as it completes the first phase of reform, aimed at curbing the
country's serious economic imbalances, the Tunisian government faces real
obstacles to further adjustment. Stabilisation policies are now giving way
to a dismantling of the command economy, and with liberalisation is coming
resistance.
Strict austerity since 1986 has brought the budget deficit down from 6.7 per
cent of GDP in 1984 to 2 per cent last year, while inflation is down to 6
per cent from a high of more than 10 per cent.
Subsidies on food staples and agricultural products have been cut from 3 per
cent of GDP to 2 per cent over the last six years, with remaining subsidies
now targeted at poorer Tunisians.
Meanwhile, economic growth has averaged 6.6 per cent over the past three
years, more than three times the rate of population growth.
But, as Mr Aziz Krichen, a Tunisian academic, argues in 'The Bourguiba
Syndrome', the real battle to modernise Tunisian society is now being fought
in the economic sphere.
Reforms to date have been backed by a steady flow of World Bank loans, worth
Dollars 400m (Pounds 281.6m) last year and Dollars 300m in 1993, and have
been helped by the country's political stability, which has survived the
upsurge in Islamic fundamentalist tensions since Mr Zine El Abidine Ben Ali
succeeded Mr Habib Bourguiba as president in November 1987.
Foreign currency restrictions have been lifted, foreign investors no longer
require prior agreement from the central bank to repatriate their capital
investments or remit profits, and Tunisians have seen their foreign currency
allowances doubled.
Vested interests in the civil service and industry are now to be challenged
by reforms aimed at raising industrial productivity, enforcing quality
control and boosting exports.
Together with the potentially destabilising impact of religious extremism in
the region, the new phase of reform amounts to the most demanding test of
President Ben Ali's skills since he took office nearly five years ago.
One of the main obstacles to reform is a banking system which bears all the
hallmarks of a command economy: it is overstaffed, has accumulated many bad
loans and is often run by former hierarchs of the Central Bank who have
little understanding of the needs of the economy.
Recent economic news has been good. Hard currency receipts from over 3m
tourists were worth close to TD1bn last year, an increase of more than 50
per cent on the 1991 figure, as the country attracted Europeans who, in more
settled times, travelled to Yugoslavia. Three good harvests have also played
their part.
But ministers are concerned about the growing trade deficit, which is
estimated to have increased last year from TD1.35bn to TD1.85bn. Imports
rose faster than expected as Tunisian businessmen took advantage of more
liberal import policy - with 85 per cent of imports now free of duties.
Simultaneously, export growth slackened, although some factors such as the
Mediterranean glut of olive oil, of which Tunisia is a major exporter, are
temporary. Others are more structural. Demand in the EC, Tunisia's principle
market, has weakened, most notably for leather and textiles.
Younger Tunisians are pushing the government to become more accountable and
to stop changing rules abruptly and without explanation, while managers are
seeking greater freedom. These reformists do not hide their resentment at
what they consider the arbitrary methods of customs and tax officials, who
one respected Tunisian businessman bemoans as having 'the mentality of the
tax inspector who believes every private investor is out to defraud the
state'.
Such attitudes, they argue, act as a brake on investment, particularly at a
time when domestic interest rates stand at 15 per cent.
Overall, however, investment is increasing, from TD2.7bn in 1990 to TD3.46bn
last year, TD3.3bn of which is domestic. With public investment reigned in
by government efforts to cut budget and public company deficits, private
investment, worth TD1.5bn last year has now overtaken the contribution made
from public funds. Foreign investment has not grown overall, the bulk of it
going to the energy sector but the volume of funds going into manufacturing
has surged from TD25m in 1988 to TD52 last year. Well known international
names such as Alcatel, Siemens, BASF, Ericsson, Goldstar and Sony are now
manufacturing in Tunisia. The US corporate presence has traditionally
focused on the oil sector, but Sara Lee in the textile sector and AT&amp;T in
telecommunications are now considering setting up in Tunisia, where labour
costs are, on average, one quarter of those in the EC.
Creating new jobs is now vital for both economic and political reasons as
unemployment remains fertile breeding ground for religious fundamentalism.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK business welcomes India's budget boost for trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IT IS one thing for the Indian government to talk about trade
liberalisation and opening up its markets to foreign competition. Let's hope
their customs officers get the same message.'
This note of scepticism, in response to last weekend's budget package from
Mr Manmohan Singh, India's finance minister, came yesterday from the chief
executive of a Yorkshire-based textile company with years of experience of
trying to sell in India.
The businessman, anxious not to offend, said experience showed central
government initiatives did not necessarily have much relevance to those
trying to win business on the ground in India.
'Unless the message that the rules are changing permeates right down through
India's bureaucracy, no budget initiatives intended to boost trade will be
any use,' he suggested.
Despite such reservations, India's decision to go for an expansionary budget
has been well received in the UK. Plenty of business is at stake.
Mr Howard Davies, Confederation of British Industry director-general, who
went with Mr John Major, UK prime minister, and a business delegation to
India in January, called the budget measures 'encouraging'.
Although import duty cuts seemed modest, and no action had been taken to
reduce dividend withholding taxes (higher than in other countries), the
budget made clear New Delhi's determination to encourage more overseas
investment.
Figures compiled by the Department of Trade and Industry show Britain sold
Pounds 945.5m-worth of goods to India in 1992, including industrial
machinery, power generating equipment, organic chemicals, metals, scientific
instruments and transport equipment.
In return, India exported to the UK products worth Pounds 862m during 1992,
including yarns, textiles, finished clothing, footwear, tea, cocoa and
animal feedstuffs.
Expectations are high that trade in both directions can expand
significantly. The January visit led to the Indo-British Partnership
Initiative, intended to foster political and business links between the two
countries.
Mr Robert Evans, British Gas chairman, who is leading the new organisation,
welcomed the budget. The measures would advance the considerable potential
for trade with India and provide a 'kick start' to the initiative, he
declared.
British Gas is anxious to expand business in India. The company has just
overcome competition from Europe and Asia to win exclusive rights from the
Gas Authority of India to set up a Pounds 35m natural gas supply system in
Bombay. A spokesman said India's consolidation of liberalisation reforms
should further help business prospects.
The power generation sector also welcomed the budget measures. Mr Graham
Hadley, a director of National Power, said he was encouraged by the specific
budget references to the power industry, which reflected the government's
acknowledgment of that sector's role in India's economic development.
He took a 'bullish' view of the proposals. 'The package offers further
evidence the Indian government takes seriously the need to change the rules
to attract inward investment, particularly for capital-intensive and
infrastructure projects.'
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate which already has extensive food, tea
and personal product businesses in India, said the budget offered 'very
positive vibes' for future business. The government was 'clearly on the
road' to further liberalisation and encouragement of trade growth.
Companies such as GEC-Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering group which has
recently won a deal for a Pounds 140m high-voltage converter station to link
regions of India's electricity system, are also keen to develop new markets
there, and will welcome measures intended to make access easier.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Jobless rate in Japan falls to 2.3%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S unemployment rate unexpectedly fell in January to 2.3 per cent,
although government economists cautioned that the fall was likely to be
temporary.
The Management and Co-ordination Agency said yesterday the seasonally
adjusted unemployment rate in January fell from 2.4 per cent in December.
The fall largely reflects a strong growth in employment in the construction
sector which is enjoying a surge in orders from public works programmes.
The main federation of construction contractors yesterday announced an 8.6
per cent increase in orders in January compared with last year, the first
rise in order intake for 10 months.
It is likely, however, that unemployment will grow over the next few months
as manufacturers attack their costs by laying off workers.
In the past two weeks leading employers such as Nissan, the carmaker, and
NTT and KDD, the telecommunications groups, have announced plans for
sweeping job reduction programmes.
Toyobo, the textiles company, yesterday announced it was suspending
production at 10 of its factories for between four and eight days this month
to help reduce production by 20 per cent. About 3,000 factory workers will
be paid to stay at home during the shutdowns.
The aggregate employment figures disguise subtle shifts in the character of
the workforce which are helping to restrain the growth in officially
recorded unemployment.
The ratio of job offers to applications rose from 0.92 in December to 0.93
in January, which means there were 93 job offers for every 100 people
looking for work.
The improvement in the ratio was mainly caused by a sharp drop in the number
of people looking for jobs, which fell by 3.1 per cent between December and
January as many women withdrew from the workforce. Manufacturers, in
particular, are cutting deeply into recruitment with a 28 per cent fall in
job offers.
Employment rose by 0.5 per cent, the smallest increase since 1987, with a
6.3 per cent increase in construction employment and a 1.5 per cent rise in
the service sector offset by a 1.5 per cent fall in manufacturing.
A substantial part of the rise in service sector employment is accounted for
by a growth in part-time jobs at the expense of full-time jobs.

US forces may have to stay in Somalia in large numbers for another two
months before the United Nations takes command of military operations, the
US military said yesterday, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
The process could take even longer if the UN Security Council does not pass
a resolution setting up a peacekeeping force for Somalia this week, Colonel
Fred Peck said.
The US, which has just over 15,000 troops in Somalia, plans to contribute
5,000 to the new UN force which will take over the task of protecting relief
supplies, disarming militias and encouraging reconciliation.
Mr Robert Oakley, US special envoy to Somalia, declined to predict how long
it would take to complete the process of transition from Unitaf to Unosom 2,
the slightly smaller UN force that will take over.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Malaysia may buy Dollars 700m Mig fighters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE cold war might be over but the arms race continues. For the past two
days Mr Alexander Rutskoi, vice-president of Russia, has been acting as an
arms salesman in Malaysia.
The Malaysian air force wants a new generation of fighter aircraft. After
considering French and Anglo-German-Italian fighters, the choice has come
down to the Russian Mig 29, the General Dynamics F-16 or the McDonnell
Douglas F/A-18. The value of the initial fighter contract is estimated at
anywhere between Dollars 700m (Pounds 493m) and Dollars 1bn.
This increasingly hard-nosed battle between Russia and the US comes at a
time of growing defence spending in many Asian countries. Nervousness has
set in following the closure of US bases in the Philippines. There is
concern that conflicts might arise over ownership of the Spratlys - a group
of islands in the South China Sea claimed by China, Vietnam, Taiwan,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
The increasing power of China's armed forces is worrying many in the region.
China purchased nearly Dollars 2bn worth of arms from Russia last year,
including advanced Su-27 fighters, and is considering buying a Russian
aircraft carrier.
Yesterday, in a meeting with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, Mr Rutskoi is believed to have offered to set up various spare
parts and technical facilities in Malaysia for the Mig. Malaysia's defence
spending is rising by more than 20 per cent this year.
'It is in our interests to see that there will be no vacuum in the region,
as it may result in a new area of conflict,' says Mr Najib Abdul Razak,
Malaysia's defence minister.
Last month Malaysia signed a memorandum of understanding with India on
defence co-operation. India, which already builds and operates the Mig 29,
may help Malaysia establish its new fighter force. McDonnell Douglas and
General Dynamics have countered by offering what are said to be considerably
reduced sale prices for their fighters. A US delegation was here last month
in an effort to thwart the Russian bid.
Initially the Malaysian air force is expected to buy between 16 and 20
fighters, with options on 40 more. Russia is also believed to be offering to
sell Malaysia a number of its large Mig 35 helicopter gunships and a variety
of other weaponry.
The Russians say the Migs can be delivered within six months. US
manufacturers are likely to take considerably longer. Russia is also
reported to be willing to accept some form of barter payment from Malaysia
for a portion of the sale - possibly palm oil.
Military analysts say that by buying the Migs Malaysia would upset a growing
trend towards air force co-operation inside the Association of South East
Asian Nations (Asean). Other Asean air forces have western equipment. If
Malaysia does buy Migs it will be the first big arms sale by Russia in the
Asean region.
Indonesia, the Philippines and Burma are all at present being courted by
Russia's arms dealers. Earlier this year Indonesia announced plans to buy 39
vessels belonging to the former East German navy, all made in what was the
Soviet Union.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Relations between UK and Iran dip further
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sharp deterioration in diplomatic relations between Iran and Britain,
caused mainly by the row over the author Mr Salman Rushdie, is threatening
to spill over into the commercial field.
The decision by Iran this week to begin charging Pounds 504 for visas for UK
businessmen visiting Tehran is posing doubts over future trade missions,
while the latest British restrictions on the export of sensitive material
may spark further Iranian retaliation.
Mr Gholamreza Ansari, the Iranian charge d'affaires, was called to the
Foreign Office yesterday to be told that the Department of Trade and
Industry would not approve licences for items on international lists of
banned military or atomic energy equipment.
Iran has strenuously denied accusations that it is seeking to build nuclear
weapons, but admits it would like to acquire nuclear technology for civil
purposes. It also claims its military re-equipment is much smaller than
other countries in the region.
The Iranian embassy in London said yesterday the decision to charge Pounds
504 for a visa, as against the Pounds 14 it levied previously, was direct
retaliation for a similar rise in charges made by Britain last year.
British officials insist however that the Pounds 20 charged for a visa in
Tehran is in line with other European countries. The change made by Britain
was to calculate the visa charge at the free market rate of exchange,
instead of the old official rate. This meant that in terms of Iranian rials
the cost went up from R1,200 to R50,000. A central economic reform
instigated by President Ali Hashemi Rafsanjani has been to move more of
Iran's foreign transactions on to the free market rate of exchange.
An Iranian official said the new charge would apply to everyone applying for
a visa in London, but there might eventually be exceptions.
The decision is causing the London of Chamber of Commerce to reconsider a
trade mission to Iran planned for May. Some 15 companies have signed up for
the trip with another 25 registered as possible participants.
In January, the Energy Industries Council was forced to abandon a similar
mission to Iran when approval for visas failed to materialise.
UK and Iranian officials say the row over visa charges is distinct from the
clash over the death penalty passed by Iran on Mr Salman Rushdie over the
publication of his book The Satanic Verses.
The British government's decision to give greater publicity to Mr Rushdie's
plight has clearly angered the Iranians. In the past fortnight, Ayatollah
Ali Sayed Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, has thrown his weight behind
the fatwa, or religious ruling, against Mr Rushdie and this was later
supported by the Iranian parliament. The issue will be given further
prominence when Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, carries out his
promise to meet Mr Rushdie.
Iran has been an increasingly attractive market for Britain, with exports up
by 20 per cent to Dollars 840m (Pounds 577m) in the first nine months of
last year. But with Iran falling further behind in paying letters of credit
and oil revenues static, ministers in Tehran have warned of a cut of up to
50 per cent in imports for the financial year beginning March 21.

<TEXT>
A New York-based human rights organisation has urged the new US
administration to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on China to
bring about political change.
Asia Watch, a division of Human Rights Watch, said that President Bill
Clinton should ensure that 'clear and verifiable human rights conditions' be
attached to any renewal of China's Most Favoured Nation trading status.
In a report, titled 'Economic Reform/Political Repression', Asia Watch
denounced China's attempts to present a more benign face to the world,
saying there was little sign of genuine political liberalisation to match
economic reforms.
In spite of China's 'smile offensive' thousands of pro-democracy activists
remained in prison and political opposition to the Communist party was
heavily repressed, the report said.
Congress requires the president to decide annually whether China's human
rights record warrants continuation of MFN. Mr Bush continued to approve
MFN, arguing this would strengthen reform elements in China.

<TEXT>
THE flotation of India's rupee, announced in the annual budget at the
weekend, got off to a smooth start yesterday, with the currency rising
modestly against the US dollar.
The rupee closed at Rs31.85 to the dollar yesterday, compared with Rs32.78
at the opening and Rs32.58 at the end of trading last Friday, the last day
before Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, disclosed his plan to float
the currency.
The government has abolished the former two-tier exchange rate in which
exporters and other earners of foreign exchange were obliged to change part
of their funds into rupees at a low official rate.
This low-cost foreign currency was used by the government to import oil and
other commodities.
In place of the two-tier system, the rupee has been made fully convertible
on the trade account, though numerous restrictions remain on Indians
acquiring currency for other purposes.
Dealers in Bombay said trading was quiet yesterday with the Indian Oil
Corporation, the state-owned oil company and a major importer, staying out
of the market.
It was 'a very smooth transition,' said a dealer at the Bank of Baroda, an
Indian bank, and quite unlike the hectic trading which prevailed when the
two-tier rate system was introduced only a year ago.
Meanwhile, in the stock market, shares continued their post-budget decline
with the Bombay stock market's leading share index falling 27.36 to
2,543.82.
However, stocks closed well above the day's low of 2,494.52, indicating that
the sharp correction may be over.

FT  03 MAR 93 / German output continues to fall
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S industrial slump is continuing unabated, despite signs of a modest
improvement in output during January.
Output is falling by an average 2.5 per cent each month and the construction
industry is now the only sector showing any growth, according to figures
published by the Economics Ministry yesterday.
Meanwhile, steel output has plunged and details of incoming orders in the
engineering business showed further falls in domestic and foreign demand.
Total industrial output in January was 3 per cent higher than in December
despite widespread short-time working in the automotive industry, according
to the Economics Ministry.
The apparent recovery followed a 3 per cent month-on-month fall in December
(corrected from 2 per cent), when most of industry took extended Christmas
breaks.
A comparison of production in December and January together with the same
period a year earlier showed total output had fallen 6.8 per cent:
manufacturing was down 7.7 per cent.
Within this figure, production of capital goods slumped almost 11 per cent,
while construction rose 2.5 per cent.
New figures from the VDMA engineering and plant makers association showed
new orders in January were 18 per cent lower than a year earlier. Domestic
demand fell 24 per cent and new foreign contracts were down 11 per cent.
This sector, second only to the motor industry as an export earner, has now
recorded falling orders for almost a year with only slight signs of
improvement from overseas markets more than cancelled out by diving domestic
demand.
In the three months to the end of January total orders were 13 per cent
lower than the comparable period 12 months earlier.
The knock-on effects of this downturn, cuts in the motor industry and the
international steel crisis are now wholly apparent in the steel sector,
where January output of steel and rolled finished products was 25 per cent
and 15 per cent lower than in January 1991.
Other government statistics due out later this week are expected to show
further sharp increases in unemployment and falling orders across the whole
of manufacturing industry.

<TEXT>
LEADING carmakers warned yesterday that West European new car sales could
fall by 8-9 per cent this year with a decline of around 1.1m.
Mr Louis Hughes, president of GM Europe, forecast a drop in new car demand
across west Europe to around 12.3m from 13.45m last year.
Mr Hughes forecast a fall in new car sales in four of the five main volume
markets, Germany, Italy, France and Spain with only a modest increase in the
UK. Sales in the five markets, which account for more than 80 per cent of
total west European new car registrations, are forecast to fall by more than
1m units to just under 10m this year.
The most dramatic decline was expected in Germany where new car sales were
forecast to fall by 19 per cent to around 3.2m, a loss of almost 750,000
units from 1992, said Mr Hughes.
In Italy, Europe's second largest market, new car sales were expected to
drop by 10 per cent to under 2.1m, he said.
Mr Hughes warned that the workforce of GM Europe (Opel/Vauxhall) would be
cut by around 3,000 this year following a similar reduction in 1992. GM
Europe has a complete halt on the recruitment of hourly-paid workers in its
European operations.
GM Europe's core Opel/Vauxhall car and light commercial vehicle operations
suffered a 31 per cent fall in net profits last year to Dollars 1.36bn from
a record Dollars 1.96bn in 1991, the company said yesterday. However, it
remained the most profitable volume car maker in Europe.
The chief executives of Ford and Peugeot issued similarly pessimistic
forecasts for European car demand this year, which will add pressure to the
continuing disagreement between the European Community and Japan over the
level of Japanese car sales in Europe this year.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Talks break down after employers refuse 26% rise

<TEXT>
ARBITRATION talks for east Germany's metal and electrical workers broke down
in Saxony-Anhalt on Monday night after Gesamtmetall, the employers
association, told IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering union, it would not
pay the sector a 26 per cent wage increase.
The breakdown of the talks means that IG Metall will have to decide what
room there is for compromise without losing face, or gauge whether its
280,000 members have the stomach for an all-out strike in an industry facing
increasing unemployment.
Throughout the talks in the five east German states, Gesamtmetall had
offered IG Metall a 9 per cent rise, an increase which is becoming the
accepted target in other industrial sectors of the eastern economy. However,
IG Metall officials yesterday said such an increase ignored the fact that
east Germans had to pay west German prices with east German incomes. It also
accused employers of reneging on a contract agreed in March 1991 which would
bring east German wages up to west German levels by April 1994.
Wages for eastern Germany's metal, electrical and steel sectors are
currently 70 per cent of west German levels. A 26 per cent increase next
month would have brought them up to 82 per cent, even though productivity is
about 70 per cent below west German levels.
Arbeitgeberverband Stahl, the steel employers association, which yesterday
started arbitration talks in Berlin with IG Metall for the steel sector,
said it too was prepared initially to offer eastern German steel workers a 9
per cent pay increase, instead of the planned 20 per cent stipulated in the
March 1991 contract. A spokesman denied the association was breaking the
contract. 'A clause in the contract legally entitles us this year to revise
the timetable and wage increases, if economic expectations radically changed
from the original agreement.'
But IG Metall believes the employers are not negotiating in good faith.
'What is at stake is the entire principle of collective wage bargaining,' Ms
Dagmar Opoczynski, a spokesperson for IG Metall said. 'The employers want to
opt out of collective wage bargaining and set their own wage levels in
eastern Germany. If they break the wage contract in eastern Germany, they
can do it in western Germany,' she said.
IG Metall has responded to the breakdown of talks by organising
demonstrations.

<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday set in motion plans to draw most of the population into
the country's privatisation programme.
J. Henry Schroder Wagg, the UK investment bank which is to advise on the
government's campaign to speed sales and recruit the general public as
investors, said Hungary was considering offering millions of small investors
concessions, including cheap credit, to buy assets remaining in state
control.
Entrepreneurs would be able to buy small state-owned companies, or to invest
in shares in a company through Hungary's stock market.
The proposals for popular participation mark a departure for Hungary. Until
now it has relied heavily on foreign investment and market pricing. The
first phase of privatisation, predominantly involving trade sales to western
consumer goods companies, is running out of steam.
Acquisitions by Ferruzzi, Unilever, Nestle, British American Tobacco, Philip
Morris and many other multinationals helped give privatisation proceeds of
more than Ft100bn (Pounds 80.4m) in 1991-92.
But the frequency of large deals is declining because the most attractive
and easily digestible properties in the state's portfolio, like the
cigarette makers, have already been sold. Foreign investor interest is now
focusing on the utilities, but their privatisation needs to be preceded by
time-consuming regulation.
The conservative government is anxious to draw in popular support for
privatisation because of a widespread belief that foreigners and state
company managers, many of them former communists, have monopolised
privatisation. The Hungarian Democratic Forum, the governing party, is given
added incentive by its political predicament; elections are approaching in
1994, with the Forum trailing the liberal and socialist opposition heavily
in opinion polls.

FT  03 MAR 93 / OECD urges reform of Danish benefits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A 'SUSTAINABLE and significant reduction' in Denmark's unemployment rate,
currently running at 11.7 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis, cannot be
achieved without reforms of the unemployment benefit system, according to
the OECD's annual report on the Danish economy.
A benefit rate of 90 per cent of wages for those at the lower end of the
wage scale is too generous and reduces the incentive to seek work, while the
benefit period - up to nine years - is too long, says the report.
Changing the system is politically difficult, but 'the pay-off in tackling
the problems of high income support and of enforcement would be large in
terms of fewer people out of work, higher potential output, and improved
public finances,' it says.
The report is optimistic about Danish growth potential. Policies which have
produced an inflation rate of only about 1.5 per cent and a balance of
payments surplus close to 3 per cent of gross domestic product have laid the
foundations for the country 'to resume a sustainable path of further
growth,' it says.
But it warns against further relaxation of fiscal policy, which was loosened
considerably by the budget for 1993.
The OECD forecasts a 2.1 per cent GDP growth rate for Denmark in 1993, which
is slightly higher than the latest Danish government forecast and reflects a
higher OECD forecast for export growth.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Sharp fall in demand for plastics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES and demand for petrochemicals and plastics in Germany 'fell off the
edge of a cliff' in the last quarter of 1992, according to Mr Bryan
Sanderson, chief executive of BP Chemicals, the UK group.
A 12 per cent fall in manufacturing output between November and December fed
straight through to the plastics industry, said Mr Sanderson. 'The downturn
was quick and unexpected,' he added. 'Margins for ethylene are the worst
since 1982. Manufacturers are losing hundreds of millions of dollars.'
Mr Sanderson called for urgent rationalisation of the European petrochemical
industry. At least three and possibly four ethylene crackers needed to be
closed, and three plastics plants mothballed if the industry profitability
was to return.
'The Germans are in the wrong place for petrochemicals and polymers
manufacturing,' said Mr Sanderson. German producers were disadvantaged by an
over-valued D-Mark, high environmental costs, excessive wage and social
costs, and a high level of absenteeism, he explained.
'German manufacturers used to compensate from their natural disadvantages by
being the most efficient producers. That's no longer possible. It's very
difficult to be optimistic about the German economy over the next couple of
years.'

<TEXT>
RUSSIA said yesterday it would join the US in air-dropping aid into
Bosnia-Hercegovina, in a move which would mark unprecedented co-operation
between the two cold war adversaries.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, foreign minister, said he expected Russian planes to fly
to Bosnia from Nato airfields. There was no immediate indication of when the
operations might be launched or their scale.
US aircraft carried out a third air-drop over Bosnia last night but Mr Les
Aspin, US defence secretary, said the missions might be stopped temporarily
as more land convoys were being allowed to carry aid into the region.
In New York, meanwhile, UN and European Community negotiators deplored the
continuation of heavy fighting in eastern Bosnia while peace talks under
their auspices were taking place in the city.
Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen also deplored the fact that relief convoys were
still being blocked. They urged measures to enable the wounded to be
evacuated and expressed concern about new displacement of civilians.
Their statement was issued after President Alija Izetbegovic of Bosnia
raised the matter with the mediators at the outset of his first meeting with
them since the talks were transferred from Geneva. On Monday he told
reporters in Washington that he was bringing proposals to the UN for a US
role in a ceasefire and military disengagement, but no details were
available.
There was no indication if or when a negotiating session including all the
parties would take place in New York. Mr Haris Silajdzic, the Bosnian
foreign minister, has been named to lead the government delegation when Mr
Izetbegovic leaves for home. He has said he would remain in New York only
two or three days.
Serbs yesterday lifted a week-long blockade of the River Danube which
stranded at least 22 ships in ports along the river and halted international
traffic, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Bribe scandals hit Italy's credit ratings

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE spreading corruption scandals affecting Italy's political establishment
are beginning to affect Italy's credit ratings.
Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday announced a
downgrading of the rating on Italy's sovereign long-term foreign debt from
AA+ to AA. This comes after last Friday's statement from Moody's, the other
main international credit rating agency, that Italy's debt was to be placed
under review.
The Moody's move provoked an unprecedented joint rebuttal from the Bank of
Italy and the Treasury. They accused Moody's of failing to take account of
the positive corrective measures introduced in recent months to tackle
Italy's public sector deficit.
Yesterday the Italian financial authorities issued no formal response to the
S&amp;P move. Even with yesterday's downgrading S&amp;P still rates Italy as a
significantly better credit risk than Moody's. If Moody's review results in
Italy being downgraded to single A status, then many credit-conscious
international investors will cease to buy its bonds.
Standard &amp; Poor's action yesterday was based on a combination of political
and economic criteria. The agency said the corruption scandals were
weakening the fragile government coalition. The markets, which had reacted
nervously to Moody's announcement, appeared to have discounted a move by
Standard &amp; Poor's.
The lira was being traded yesterday at L955 against the D-Mark.
Last August, when problems first arose with creditors over payment of debts
of Efim, the state holding company placed in liquidation, Moody's downgraded
Italian debt from AA1 to AA3. Italy has undertaken with its EC partners, in
return for a four-tranche Ecu8bn (Pounds 6.54bn) loan, to reduce the public
sector deficit from nearly 11 per cent to 9.3 per cent of GDP this year. The
budget envisages raising L93,000bn (Pounds 40.6bn) in taxes and extra
revenues, about 5.8 per cent of GDP.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Transport ministers in toll roads warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSPORT ministers from Britain and Germany yesterday warned that car and
lorry drivers faced the widespread introduction of tolls on Europe's trunk
roads and motorways.
They said raising more money from vehicle owners presented the only
realistic prospect of funding the increases in road capacity needed to cope
with the forecast growth in European traffic.
Opening a Financial Times transport conference in London yesterday, Mr John
MacGregor, UK transport minister, said the challenge to governments
throughout Europe was how to finance the new roads their economies needed.
He said the UK government would this spring be proposing the introduction of
direct charges for the use of inter-urban roads to attract private sector
finance into roadbuilding.
Mr Gunther Krause, German transport minister, told the conference that
Europe faced a looming 'mobility crisis' because of rapidly rising traffic
flows - with Germany, the 'number one transit country', at the centre of it.
The German government, he said, was planning to introduce motorway charges
to fund new roadbuilding, so creating the conditions for a privatisation of
the motorway network. The budget funds released by the new source of income
would be spent on improving the railways.

FT  03 MAR 93 / EC in new agreement on small print in contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community yesterday gave consumers a new weapon to use against
unfair small print in contracts.
EC consumer affairs ministers agreed a directive to outlaw standard
contracts weighted against the consumer.
The accord ends 16 years of discussion between member states, and could open
a range of previously acceptable agreements to legal challenge, including
banks' contracts with customers, package holiday deals which allow tour
companies to impose surcharges, and even broad warnings that customers use
services 'at their own risk'.
But consumer organisations said yesterday that the new legislation, which
will not come into force until December 31 1994, did not go far enough, and
was too vague.
They believe it should include a definitive list of illegal clauses, rather
than an 'indicative' list, and should cover all contracts, including those
negotiated by the consumer.
Ms Monique Goyens, legal adviser to Beuc, the European consumers'
organisation, said: 'We are pleased that this directive is almost on the
statute books, but it will bring few concrete benefits to any of Europe's
consumers.'
Other consumer groups said its main benefit would be to raise consumers'
awareness of the dangers hidden in the small print.
Ms Rebecca Evans, barrister with the Consumers' Association in London, said:
'A big piece of legislation coming in will reinforce in the public mind that
they are not stuck with the small print, and there are things that companies
can't do.'
Mr Jan Trojberg, the industry minister in Denmark, which holds the EC
presidency, said the directive would raise minimum consumer protection
standards in southern EC countries such as Spain and Portugal.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Triffin, far-sighted economist: Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT TRIFFIN, who played a major role in the recreation of European
currency convertibility after the second world war and correctly diagnosed
the critical weakness of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system, died
on February 23 in Ostend, Belgium, at the age of 81.
Born in Flobecq, Belgium, Triffin was educated at Louvain and Harvard
Universities, becoming a US citizen in 1942. Between 1942 and 1949 he held
positions with the Federal Reserve System and the International Monetary
Fund. His most important official role, however, was in Paris as special
policy adviser at the Economic Co-operation Administration and alternate US
representative at the European Payments Union, between 1949 and 1951.
Thereupon, Triffin taught at Yale University, before returning to Belgium in
1977 and reassuming Belgian citizenship.
Triffin's main practical contribution to international monetary economics
came shortly after the second world war in the establishment of the European
Payments Union. The EPU set the European currencies on the path towards
currency convertibility and provided a framework for the renewal of
multilateral trade within Europe.
Triffin's most important intellectual contribution, however, was his seminal
critique of the Bretton Woods system, first published in 1959 and reprinted
in 1960 in the most famous of his books, Gold and the Dollar Crisis. Though
proved largely right, his fate was to be a Cassandra, unable to persuade
policy makers to make the changes that would have preserved a system in
whose underlying principles he strongly believed.
Triffin argued that the fundamental flaw in the operation of the
international monetary system agreed at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire in 1944
would turn out to be not a shortage of dollars, as most economists had
argued, but a glut. Inadequate growth of the stocks of monetary gold would
make the world increasingly dependent on rising US dollar reserves, which
would have to be supplied through a deficit in the US balance of payments.
Sooner or later, however, the US would have to correct its deficit, since
the rest of the world would become increasingly unwilling to accept the US
currency at a fixed exchange rate.
At that stage, he argued, the world would face a three-fold choice:
revaluation of the gold stock; generalised floating; or internationalisation
of foreign exchange reserves. Triffin preferred the last alternative. As was
probably inevitable, however, the US pre-empted that choice by terminating
US dollar convertibility into gold in 1971, a decision that left the world
with its subsequent regime of floating exchange rates among major
currencies.

UKRAINE'S nuclear missiles are leaking dangerous amounts of radiation
because Kiev is refusing to give Russia access to the weapons for
maintenance, General Mikhail Koleznikov, head of the general headquarters of
the Russian army, said yesterday.
'According to our data,the radiation levels from some sites exceed the
permissible levels by thousands of times,' Gen Koleznikov said.
The state of the weapons was now 'very serious'. Russia had 'lost control'
of the missiles and could no longer take responsibility for their safety.
Mr Boris Tarasiuk, Ukraine's deputy foreign minister, yesterday described
the latest Russian claims as 'imaginings'. He said Russia was pressing
Ukraine to give up the missiles. 'According to our experts the state of the
nuclear missiles located on Ukrainian territory in no way differs from that
of the missiles found in Russia,' Mr Tarasiuk said. He said that Russian
experts had full access to the missiles to perform necessary maintenance and
that Ukraine was fully prepared to pay for Russian spare parts.
A senior Nato diplomat in Kiev said yesterday that he was concerned about
the safety of the warheads and hoped the issue would be resolved quickly. He
said it was difficult to determine the true state of the missiles 'but I am
more inclined to believe the Ukrainian claims'.
Mr Shaun Gregory, a nuclear weapons specialist at the University of
Bradford's School of Peace Studies, said nuclear materials would deteriorate
more rapidly in older and less sophisticated weapons such as the six-warhead
SS-19 missiles, which were deployed more than 10 years ago. Ukraine has 130
of these missiles at Khmel'Nitskiy and Pervomaysk. Warheads would normally
be refurbished every couple of years, Mr Gregory said.

<TEXT>
THE cost to France of deploying some 10,000 soldiers in the service of the
United Nations and of other emergency military missions abroad will rise
from FFr3.2bn (Pounds 400m) last year to FFr4bn this year, Mr Pierre Joxe,
the defence minister, forecast yesterday.
Clearly regarding as a dubious privilege France's provision of more troops
to the UN than any other country, Mr Joxe told the newspaper Les Echos that
he had asked the government to bear the cost of bonuses for soldiers serving
overseas out of its general budget. Otherwise, the defence equipment budget
would suffer, he warned.
Pay bonuses account for two-thirds of special military operations abroad,
the minister said. Conscripts, for instance, who volunteer to serve in
Yugoslavia receive FFr5,000 a month, or 10 times their normal stipend at
home.
The Socialists strongly oppose the phasing out of conscription, proposed by
some leading members of the RPR Gaullists who are expected to form part of
the new government after next month's election. The army general staff
yesterday published a study claiming that the French army of 250,000 men was
not only 'no worse equipped' than Britain's purely professional force of
130,000, but 20 per cent cheaper.
Meanwhile, Mr Joxe has said more arms sales like last month's deal to supply
the United Arab Emirates with Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 2.46bn) worth of tanks
could be in the offing.
He cited Oman as a potential buyer.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Moves on private pension funds buoy shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S government has opened the way to private pension funds, bringing the
country into line with most of its European neighbours.
The step, still to be discussed by parliament but to be passed as a decree
law, will take pressure off the over-burdened state pension system and
should stimulate the flow of new funds to the stock market ahead of the
government's privatisation programme.
Italian shares rose strongly for the second day running yesterday as a
result of the decision, which should eventually boost equity purchases by
big institutional investors. Shares in insurance companies, seen as the main
beneficiaries of the planned new legislation, rose most strongly. Trading
was particularly active, according to brokers.
The voluntary system, which will not replace the existing state pension
scheme, will be open to individuals, professional associations, trade unions
and companies. The attraction of private pensions will be boosted by tax
incentives, akin to those currently available on life insurance policies,
where regular premiums can be partly offset against income tax.
The finances of Italy's state pension scheme have been increasingly strained
in recent years. The system, now being revised, is generous by the standards
of most neighbouring countries. Moreover, longer life-expectancy and the
steady shift towards an ageing population mean current payments into the
system have increasingly had to be used to pay pensions for past
contributors, rather than cover future pensions for those currently in work.
The prospect of new pension funds, which could invest part of their
resources in shares, contributed to near-record volumes of more than L500bn
(Pounds 222m) on the Milan stock exchange on Monday.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Heroes of the Italian inquisition: A look at the role of
investigative magistrates probing corruption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN OBSCURE television programme presenting court cases has suddenly become
mass viewing in Italy.
The producers hit on the idea of covering a case of municipal corruption in
Milan with Mr Antonio Di Pietro, the high-profile investigative magistrate,
as the prosecuting attorney. The case, now nearing its close, has attracted
more than 8m viewers.
The programme's success derives from the mix of voyeurism at the pathetic
figure of a municipal official writhing under the accusations of corruption
and the satisfaction of seeing a confident interrogation by Mr Di Pietro as
the triumphant prosecution. As the nation is buffeted by the growing wave of
corruption scandals, it needs heroes and villains.
The investigative magistrates, led by the team in Milan which started to
lift the lid on corruption a year ago and which includes Mr Di Pietro, are
undoubted heroes. But to what extent are they behaving correctly and are
they stigmatising those investigated as automatic villains?
Their critics have tended to be discounted because they are chiefly among
the ranks of the accused like Mr Bettino Craxi, former Socialist leader.
However, the comportment of the magistrates raises awkward questions about
their tactics and political motivation.
The investigative magistrate plays the role of a detective in an accusatory
system of justice with powers of preventive detention. Any person about to
be investigated has to be issued with a caution warning them of this avviso.
The magistrates have exploited the issuing of the avviso as a form of public
announcement of guilt. People like Mr Craxi have heard they are under
investigation through the media, who in turn treat the avviso as a proof of
magistrates possessing substantial evidence against the individual. The
avviso, an instrument intended to protect citizens rights, has thus becomes
a form of accusation.
Magistrates have the right to imprison a suspect for three months, renewable
on request by the courts. Throughout the Milan corruption scandal there has
been a clear correlation between the amount of time a person spends in
prison and their willingness to confess.
Mr Salvatore Ligresti, the financier and builder dubbed the 'King of Milan
concrete', spent 101 days in prison before he was released after talking of
his role in pay-offs to politicians.
Mr Enzo Papi, the managing director of Fiat's construction arm,
Cogefar-Impresit, remained in prison for 55 days before being released after
a confession. In contrast, Mr Silvano Larini, the Milan architect who helped
collect commissions for the Socialists, handed himself in last month after
eight months on the run having done a deal with magistrates. He was home on
bail within three days.
Milan's now notorious San Vittore prison, which houses the majority of those
imprisoned, was built in 1879 to hold 800 detainees. Currently it has 2,040
and a further 80 in its clinic. The lawyer of Mr Antonio Mosconi, the chief
executive of Toro, Fiat's insurance arm, complained last week that his
client, arrested on February 22, was sharing a cell with three others.
The magistrates argue they need preventive detention both to stop people
leaving the country and stop people they are about to charge from talking to
each other. At present at least three people are on the run, including the
former head of Ferruzzi-Montedison, Mr Giuseppe Garofano, wanted for alleged
involvement in pay-offs to the political parties. But it is not just the
fact of preventive detention which has worried some of the victims - it is
also the way the media is frequently tipped off to be present at arrests.
The media, working in a pool, is also used to filter information on
interrogations which in theory are covered by secrecy. In the meantime, the
person investigated has either no chance to reply or replies once the
magistrates' version is already known. In the case of the Milan corruption
scandal, the position of accused persons is complicated because so many
people have decided to confess to either taking or receiving bribes - close
to 110.
The final issue of the magistrates' behaviour centres on the accusation that
the investigation is politically motivated, aimed at decapitating a corrupt
politico-economic establishment. The Socialists believe they have been made
particular victims with their leadership in the front line. In private top
Socialists wonder why the investigative net has not caught up with senior
figures in the Christian Democrats.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Emergency powers hint by Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and DMITRI VOLKOV
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday gave the strongest hint yet he was
considering some form of emergency rule in an effort to break the impasse
with conservative forces over Russian political and economic reform.
If he could get no agreement on a division of powers during a special
Congress of People's Deputies likely to be held in a week's time he would
call his own plebiscite to establish whether the president or parliament had
supremacy .
At a meeting of the group 'Democratic Choice' he appeared to accept that a
constitutional referendum, which requires the agreement of parliament, would
not be possible. Parliament appears set to repudiate the agreement it made
with him in December to hold such a referendum in April.
He admitted that, 'constitutionally, (the plebiscite) would not carry great
weight but at least it would clarify for everyone whom the people support
and which way we should go'.
Then, in a heavy hint of authoritarian action, he said that should no
agreement be forthcoming even after the plebiscite, 'there is a final option
which I don't want to talk about. I don't think things will go that far and
I hope that they don't. We should respect the constitution, but if
conservatives use extreme measures to destroy Russia, we must use other ways
to save democracy and reform'.
The president ended his speech at that point without spelling out the
meaning of 'other paths'.
Mr Lev Ponomarev, a leader of the Democratic Russia movement, said after the
meeting that he and his colleagues supported Mr Yeltsin's intention to 'act
decisively' and said that 'it is his duty to act to safeguard order in a
pre-putsch situation'.
As proof of his 'pre-putsch' assertion, Mr Ponomarev pointed to appeals to
army officers in the weekly Den - an influentail organ of the hard right
opposition forces - to create 'underground organisations', and to the calls
by hard left and right deputies for direct confrontation with the
constitutional power.
'If an emergency situation is declared, then Democratic Russia would want to
influence the government to preserve democratic procedures during that
period and for elections as soon as possible after it,' he said.
Hard-line deputies are considering mounting yet another attempt to impeach
Mr Yeltsin at the special congress.
Mr Yona Andronov, deputy chairman of the Parliamentary Committee on
international Affairs, said yesterday the move would gather more support
than a similar effort last December, when more than 300 deputies registered
their approval.
Although Mr Yeltsin's comments were veiled, his speech suggests he now sees
decreasing room for agreement, and increasing necessity for a swift severing
of the noose.
A further indication of this tension was the adoption by the Praesidium of
the parliament on Monday of a motion which laid out the procedure for
parliament declaring emeregncy rule - a procedure which would strip the
President of all effective powers. The draft motion still has to be carried
by parliament, but indicates the mood of the parliamentary leadership.
Mr Yeltsin's speech was accompanied by the publication of an interview in
the Communist daily Pravda, showing a rather tetchy president grudgingly
conceding that some communists could be pro-reform and saying he would talk
to their leaders, as to all other party leaders, in a bid to get a general
agreement on reform and constitutional change.
That he gave an interview at all may be a recognition of the fact that the
Party now claims 500,000 members.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Sales of new homes increase by a fifth so far this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF new homes rose by more than a fifth during the first eight weeks of
this year, according to Britain's 15 largest housebuilders.
The figures confirm the revival of activity in the housing market reported
by builders, estate agents and building societies.
The sales rise did not prevent a further 0.3 per cent fall in house prices
last month compared with January, according to figures published yesterday
by Halifax Building Society, the country's biggest mortgage lender.
Halifax said there had been a sharp rise in mortgage applications and in
interest from potential buyers through its estate agencies, but this had not
yet worked through to prices.
Sales figures compiled by the Housebuilders Federation show that net
reservations - sales on which a deposit has been paid less cancellations -
totalled more than 5,000 in January and February for the 15 largest
housebuilders. This figure compared with 4,200 in the first two months of
last year.
The 15 companies account for about 80 per cent of new house sales. The
federation's survey, conducted weekly, also shows a 15 per cent rise, to
more than 150,000, in the number of people visiting new homes for sale
during January and February.
Abbey National, which yesterday announced a 9 per cent fall in annual
pre-tax profits to Pounds 564m, said the numbers of new mortgage offers
issued by the bank to first-time buyers and of people moving house were 30
per cent higher in January than in the same month last year.
Besides reporting a fall in profits, Abbey also said it intended to sell its
Cornerstone estate agency business. The group said it had lost Pounds 226m
on estate agency business since its acquisition in 1987.
Mr Peter Parkin, chairman of Raine Industries, one of the housebuilders
surveyed, said the number of potential purchasers visiting its sites had
risen to more than 1,000 a week in January and February. This compared with
fewer than 400 a week in December.
'Net reservations are between a fifth and a quarter higher than during
January and February last year,' Mr Parkin said.
'It is too early to talk of a sustained recovery but business is looking
better.' The improvement had occurred at sites all over the country rather
than in any particular region.
Halifax said the average price of houses which sold in February was Pounds
60,196, 7.2 per cent down on the same month last year. First-time buyers
paid 1 per cent more for houses last month as lenders targeted the group to
provide the spur to the market. 'Although house prices are still falling,
the small size of the declines in January and February could be an early
indication of stability returning to house prices in the spring,' Halifax
said.

FT  03 MAR 93 / 'Hundreds die' as Serbs overrun Moslem enclave
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOSNIAN Serb soldiers were yesterday reported to have killed hundreds of
civilians after overrunning Cerska, the Moslem enclave which was the target
of US aid drops this week.
Last night Mr Ejup Ganic, Bosnia's vice-president, said parts of Cerska were
still controlled by Bosnian government forces. But Ms Lyndall Sachs of the
Belgrade office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
indicated that 19 hamlets, comprising much of the Moslem enclave, had fallen
to Serb forces.
The reports came as four US cargo aircraft, from an airbase in Germany,
completed their third air drop over eastern Bosnia, according to Yugoslav
air traffic controllers. In another development Russia said it would join
the US in the air drops, although Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said
these might be halted temporarily.
At Cerska, in reports which could not be independently confirmed, local
radio operators said more than 500 civilians had been killed after Serb
forces seized the enclave.
One radio report said: 'The Chetniks (Bosnian Serb forces) are moving freely
around the town. They are burning houses, killing a lot of occupants . . . a
lot of civilians, women and children, mostly by slitting throats.'
'Dead bodies all over and people have nowhere to go. People cannot move,'
said the radio report, monitored by the representative of the UNHCR in
Tuzla, a Bosnian government stronghold in eastern Bosnia. 'People from
Cerska are crying for help and begging to be taken out alive. Others are
hiding in woods and ditches crying out for help.'
Another amateur radio report broadcast on Sarajevo radio said: 'Many are
trapped under rubble and being killed there.' The report said Serbian tanks
were moving through the area, razing villages to the ground.
Sarajevo radio said the Serbs were shelling routes by which people were
fleeing Cerska. 'The roads are crawling with injured and dead,' it said.
UNHCR officials were particularly concerned about reports of shelling in
Konjevic Polje where the refugees were fleeing and 1,500 wounded are
believed trapped.
Ms Sachs said even if a small part of it was correct, the situation was
desperate.
Belgrade television last night showed hazy pictures of what it said were
uniformed fighters on foot in Cerska.
In spite of pledges to allow aid to reach the besieged enclaves, believed to
house about 100,000 Moslems, Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader
who is in New York holding peace talks at the UN, has repeatedly blocked
overland convoys to Cerska and other strongholds. General Ratko Mladic, the
Bosnian Serb commander, yesterday refused UNHCR pleas for a fleet of 10
specially equipped lorries to enter the enclave and evacuate the wounded.
Amateur radio operators said 14 US aid pallets dropped on Sunday night had
been spotted at Cerska, but the heavy Serb artillery fire had made it
impossible to collect them. A radio operator in Zepa, the second target for
three US transport aircraft, said two parcels of medical supplies were found
in the snowy hills around Zepa.
Cerska, the target of the first US air drop of food and medical relief, has
been besieged since last April when Serb forces backed by the Yugoslav army
killed and drove out hundreds of thousands of Moslems from eastern Bosnia.
After the formal withdrawal of the army, which left the bulk of its
equipment and forces in Bosnia, the self-styled Serb republic controlled
most of the region except a handful of Bosnian government strongholds.
Cerska was left as the most vulnerable community, housing some 6,000
Moslems.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Private sector may run juvenile centres
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW SECURE training centres for offenders aged 12 to 15 may be run by the
private sector or voluntary organisations under proposals announced by the
government yesterday.
The two sectors will be invited to bid along with the public sector to
operate the centres which Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, said would be
'different from anything that has been offered before'.
Yesterday's announcement - part of a government response to mounting public
concern about juvenile crime - extends the potential role of the private
sector in the criminal justice system. Two prisons are already privately
managed, and competitive bids to run a third are being prepared.
The government will act as purchaser of services from the new centres. About
six - providing accommodation for a total of 250-300 young people - are
likely to be developed initially.
The centres, for a minority of persistent re-offenders, will be designed to
offer constructive training and education that tackles the causes of a young
person's behaviour. Young people will be locked up if necessary to prevent
them absconding.
Courts would be able to impose secure training orders on 12-15-year-olds
convicted of three imprisonable offences who had failed to comply with
community supervision.
Organisations working with young offenders accused the government of
repeating past mistakes with its proposals.
The National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders said
secure institutions for young people increased the chances of re-offending.
Mr Stephen Shaw, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'The graduates
from Mr Clarke's mini-prisons will be filling the adult jails for years to
come.'
Addressing a crowded Commons, Mr Clarke acknowledged the two main parties
were moving closer together on crime but one big difference was the
government had some 'solid proposals'. 'Our proposals are far in advance of
anything the other side has to hand,' he said.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow home secretary, attacked the lack of coherence in the
government's proposals and the likely delay in their implementation. 'It is
now people require action against the tide of rising crime,' he said.

FT  03 MAR 93 / 20,000 staff vote for pay cut to save jobs: Sheffield
council agreement will save Pounds 6m on wage bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY 20,000 Sheffield council workers have voted to take a 3.25 per cent
pay cut in exchange for shorter working hours to stop the city council
making 1,400 of them redundant to balance next year's budget.
The deal, which leaders at the Labour-run council believe is the first of
its kind in Britain, will boost government hopes that the fight to keep
inflation low is beginning to yield dividends in public sector pay where it
is endeavouring to confine rises to a maximum of 1.5 per cent.
Yesterday's landmark agreement will also help the council get its budget
below a Pounds 366m ceiling imposed by the government. Local authorities all
over Britain are facing up to 90,000 job losses as the government tries to
peg public spending.
In exchange for the pay cut, the employees will be able to work one hour
less a week or take seven extra days' holiday. The move will take nearly
Pounds 6m off Sheffield's wages bill. The council should be able to agree a
legal budget next week if it can now make Pounds 1.3m savings in the works
department and another Pounds 1.5m on education.
About 2,000 works staff refused the deal, while 4,000 teachers could not be
balloted because they are employed by school governors and their pay levels
are decided by the government.
The council said it would be discussing with teachers ways in which they
could improve productivity and so make the required savings.
It was suggested that one area it might look into could be the use made of
training days.
All town hall unions at Sheffield have held ballots, but works department
shop stewards substituted their own ballot question and campaigned against
the deal. Talks have started again with the shop stewards.
The council's chief officers have not yet balloted, and neither have about
200 youth and print workers. The deal will be imposed on all sections that
voted for it, including non-union staff who did not take part in the ballot.
'The cut will be treated the same way as a pay rise would - it will apply to
everyone,' the council said.
The only exceptions will be low-paid workers earning less than Pounds 90 a
week, which means part-timers.
Mr Mike Bower, leader of the Labour-controlled council, said: 'Employees
have shown a remarkable degree of commitment both to their colleagues and
the community. Nobody is happy we have been put in this situation but the
alternative - a destructive cut in services and hundreds of sackings - would
have been much worse.'
The deal also makes 1993-94 annual pay increases conditional on finding the
money to meet them from productivity improvements.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: HP moves large printer and
plotter development to Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HEWLETT-Packard, the US computers and electronics manufacturer, is to move
worldwide responsibility for the development and manufacture of large-scale
printers and plotters to Barcelona, Spain, from San Diego, California.
The move is part of an expansion programme and there will not be any job
losses in San Diego.
The company said it would invest more than Pta1.8bn (Dollars 15.3m) over the
next two years to build a new 8,000 square metre plant at its Barcelona
site.
The 300 - strong workforce is expected to double by the end of 1994.
Industry consultants estimate that the the value of plotters manufactured in
Spain will be Dollars 300m a year by 1994.
Research and development, marketing and manufacturing will all be moved to
Spain from the US.
Hewlett-Packard is a leading manufacturer of large - scale plotters and
printers, which are used to create arch-itectural and engineering drawings.
The company also said it intended to concentrate the manufacture of inkjet
printers, where it is market leader, for the European market in Barcelona
within two years.
HP will continue to make inkjet printers in Vancouver, Washington, and
Singapore.
Hewlett-Packard has been manufacturing plotters in Barcelona since 1985.
A spokesman said the company had been encouraged to develop further in the
region by the quality of components from local suppliers, by the local
workforce and by financial incentives.
The company has two other sites which manufacture products for a global
market: Andover, Massachusetts, produces medical systems; and South
Queensferry, Scotland, makes telecommunications instrumentation.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: BP to sell Australian mining
interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN and DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum has agreed to sell its 49 per cent interest in the Olympic
Dam mining project in South Australia to Western Mining Corporation, the
Australian resource group, for USDollars 240m. The agreement follows Western
Mining's decision to exercise its pre-emptive option to acquire the stake.
WMC, which owns 51 per cent of Olympic Dam, had until tomorrow to decide
whether to match a similar offer from Minorco, the overseas investment arm
of the Anglo-American Corporation-De Beers group of South Africa.
The deal to sell the mining project, which includes 450m tonnes of copper,
uranium, gold and silver deposits, will take BP out of minerals mining
altogether. But BP still has a 50 per cent stake in an Indonesian coal mine
which it will retain.
WMC said its total outlay would be Dollars 430m after paying Dollars 190m to
BP to buy out loans worth Dollars 273m. It said debt would increase by only
Dollars 157m because most of the cost would be financed from existing
resources.
The deal ends an joint venture arrangement which required BP to finance an
increase in annual production from 66,000 tonnes of copper to 150,000 tonnes
and 1,400 tonnes of uranium oxide to 4,000 tonnes.
WMC said it was reconsidering existing plans for a modest expansion to
84,000 tonnes of copper and 1,500 tonnes of uranium oxide over the next
three years at a cost of ADollars 75m (USDollars 51.00)
But the full expansion programme, which is expected to cost between ADollars
500m and ADollars 750m, was unlikely to proceed until later in the decade
unless there was a substantial improvement in uranium prices.
WMC said it was 'well placed' to finance the acquisition and future
expansion in addition to a commitment announced last week to invest ADollars
440m in the development of the Mount Keith nickel deposit in Western
Australia.
The group said it expected net debt to increase from zero to about ADollars
600m by 1993-94, equivalent to 20 per cent of equity. 'No equity issue is
contemplated or will be required,' the board said.
WMC shares fell 5 cents to ADollars 4.71 on the Australian Stock Exchange as
investors considered the impact of the deal on the group's ability to

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Carpetright appoints float team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARPETRIGHT of London, Sir Phil Harris's carpet retail chain, has appointed
advisers and non-executive directors ahead of its flotation, planned for the
summer. Details of the float are yet to be finalised but the group is
expected to be valued at between Pounds 50m and Pounds 100m.
Carpetright made a pre-tax profit in the year to April 1992 of Pounds 2.8m,
up from Pounds 351,000 the year before. Its interim profits jumped from
Pounds 1.1m to Pounds 3.4m, and analysts are expecting profits for the
current year to top Pounds 7m.
Sir Phil, who headed the Harris Queensway carpet and furniture group until
it was taken over for Pounds 450m in 1988, said that there would be 115
Carpetright stores and another 22 would open in the next year. He said the
chain could expand from cash flow.
MFI Furniture Group holds 22 per cent of the ordinary shares. It has yet to
decide whether to sell them at the time of the float. There are also Pounds
9m worth of preference shares in issue which could be redeemed from the
proceeds of the float.
The non-executives appointed yesterday are Sir Harry Djanogly, a
non-executive director of Coats Viyella and Singer and Friedlander, and Mr
Gerald Dennis, chairman of Alexandra Workwear and Domino Printing Sciences.
Sir Harry chaired Nottingham Manufacturing, the textile group which was
bought by Coats, and Mr Dennis was deputy chairman of BAT Industries.
Sponsors to the float are County NatWest and the brokers are SG Warburg
Securities.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Yukong ahead as domestic oil
demand rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YUKONG, South Korea's largest oil refining and petrochemical group, has
reported a 19.5 per cent rise in net profits to Won29.3bn (Dollars 37m) for
1992 on sales 17.4 per cent ahead at Won4,721bn.
The sales increase reflected the country's rapid growth in oil consumption.
Earnings improved due to the favourable revision of government-set foreign
exchange rates and base prices applied to crude oil imports.
Yukong also benefited from lower interest rates. The company has heavy
financial expenses following the construction of eight new petrochemical
plants in 1991.
Ssangyong Oil Refining reported net earnings up 114 per cent to Won87.3bn,
while sales rose by 12.4 per cent to Won2,043bn.
The rise in earnings reflected the same financial factors in Yukong's profit
increase.

<TEXT>
THE Johannesburg Stock exchange (JSE) plans to open its Traded Options
Market (TOM) to foreigners and non-residents. Exchange control regulation
currently bar preclude them from the equity options market.
By using TOM, foreigners will be allowed to buy and sell call and put
options on some of the main blue chip shares on the JSE as well as the
all-share index and the all gold index. This list will expand as and when
demand requires it.
Announcing the change, Mr Roy Andersen, JSE executive president, said
foreign investors would earn interest on cash margins remittable at the more
advantageous commercial rand rate of exchange. He said brokers would be able
to service a wider client base. He hoped the hedging and arbitrage
opportunities available would stimulate liquidity in the underlying cash
market.
Foreign clients will trade as ordinary clients of brokers, and may use their
financial rand or blocked rand balances for TOM trading.

flat

<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Canada, the largest of Canada's big six chartered banks,
yesterday reported little-changed net profits for the first quarter.
The bank, which is negotiating the acquisition of the trust operations of
Royal Trustco, recorded net profit for the quarter of CDollars 254m
(USDollars 211m), or 71 cents a share, in the first quarter of fiscal 1993.
This compares with CDollars 256m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. There were
more shares outstanding in the latest period.
Lower non-interest expense and larger payments received on Brazilian loans
were offset by higher domestic loan loss provisions and lower fee income.
Loan loss provisions totalled CDollars 295m, increased significantly to
cover problems in the corporate sector. A year earlier, the provision was
CDollars 185m. The bank now estimates provisions for fiscal 1993 at CDollars
820m, up CDollars 120m on the estimate at October 31 last.
Return on average assets was 0.73 per cent, against 0.76 per cent, and on
equity 14.8 per cent against 14.5 per cent.
Total assets at January 31 were CDollars 137bn, up 2 per cent from a year
earlier. If the Royal Trustco acquisition is consummated, the deal would
bring the bank's total assets to nearly CDollars 200bn.
The Toronto commercial property market deteriorated further in the latest
quarter, but retail banking, investment banking, treasury and investment
management performed as planned.
BANKS will refinance about Dollars 326m of term debt of Camdev, the former
Campeau Corporation property group.
The banks have agreed to roll-over existing loans to Camdev for up to four
years, secured by Camdev stock in a profitable US regional grocery chain and
office properties in Ottawa and London, Ontario.
BANK of Nova Scotia reported first-quarter net profit of CDollars 165m, or
70 cents a share, down about 5 per cent from CDollars 174m, or 76 cents, a
year earlier.
Return on assets was 0.65 per cent against 0.77 per cent and on equity 14.6
per cent against 16.9 per cent. Total assets at January 31 were CDollars
98bn, up nearly 5 per cent.

K MART, the US retail group which operates around 2,400 discount stores as
well as several chains of specialist stores, yesterday reported a 9.5 per
cent increase in after-tax profits for the year to January 27.
However same-store sales growth for the group overall was a modest 2.6 per
cent.
The company made after-tax profits of Dollars 941m in the 52-week period, up
from Dollars 859m in the previous year.
After-tax profits in the fourth, and most important, quarter rose by 11.7
per cent, to Dollars 535m. Earnings per share increased more modestly. Due
to an issue of equity-based securities in 1991, the figure for the last
quarter increased to Dollars 1.15 from Dollars 1.06, while for the year it
was up by 2 per cent at Dollars 2.06.
Total sales in the final quarter increased from Dollars 10.6bn to Dollars
11.5bn. For the year, there was a 9.1 per cent increase to Dollars 37.7bn.
K mart said that its gross margin for the year had slipped to 24.5 per cent
of sales, compared with 25 per cent. This reflected 'increased clearance
markdowns of spring and summer merchandise lines, especially apparel'.
K mart also noted that there was a greater sales contribution from its PACE
warehouse club chain, where margins are particularly low.
However, K mart added that the margin pressure had been greatest early in
the year and that there had been an 'excellent sell-through' of seasonal
merchandise during the Christmas season.
In the main general merchandise division, comparable store sales rose by a
modest 1.5 per cent, although operating profits increased by 11.9 per cent
to Dollars 1.56bn.
The specialty retail chains overall saw a 5.7 per cent rise in same-store
sales, with operating profits rising 10.7 per cent to Dollars 1.81bn.
The one problem area was PACE, which saw operating profits fall from Dollars
39m to Dollars 3m. K mart said the profits erosion stemmed from poor
performance of new outlets opened in 1991 and 1992, but that it expected an
improvement this year.

<TEXT>
SPAIN'S Banco Central Hispanoamericano has joined the push by Spanish banks
into Portugal through a share swap with with Banco Comercial Portugues.
Under the agreement announced yesterday, BCH has taken 10 per cent of BCP
which, in turn, has taken 2 per cent of BCH and 50 per cent of Banco Banif
Gestion Privada, a BCH 'boutique' bank that caters for wealthy clients.
The operation is thought to be the biggest share exchange between Spanish
and Portuguese institutions. BCH bought 9.14m shares in BCP at Esc2,500 each
while BCP acquired 3.4m BCN shares at Monday's closing price in Madrid of
Pta3,300.
It also marks the boldest advance made by a Portuguese bank into Spanish
territory. Mr Jorge Jardim Goncalves, BCP chairman, is likely to be given a
seat on the BCH board next month.
BCH, Spain's biggest bank in terms of assets, and BCP said they were looking
forward to 'long term co-operation' and that they 'share a similar
philosophy of performance both in the Portuguese and Spanish markets.'
It is not clear whether BCH plans to use its BCP stake merely as a source of
dividends or whether it will try to operate in some way in Portugal through
the BCP association. BCH has just reported a dramatic 22 per cent fall in
net profits last year, to Pta52.6bn.

FT  03 MAR 93 / International Company News: Morgan Stanley president to step
down
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN Stanley, the Wall Street securities house, announced yesterday that
Mr Robert Greenhill will step down as the firm's president this summer to
concentrate on his work as an adviser on client transactions.
Mr John Mack, head of Morgan Stanley's operating committee which oversees
the day-to-day running of the firm, will become the new president on June
10, when the company holds its annual meeting. Mr Greenhill will remain on
the board of directors.
Mr Richard Fisher, Morgan Stanley chairman, said the changes at the top
would not affect the firm's business strategy or management style.
Along with Mr Fisher, Mr Greenhill and Mr Mack have held the reins at Morgan
Stanley for several years, guiding the firm through its evolution into a
global investment banking and securities trading powerhouse.
In recent years, however, Mr Greenhill's role as president, with its
management and administrative responsibilities, has clashed with his work as
a deal-maker and adviser to Morgan Stanley's biggest clients, which kept him
away from the firm's New York head office for long stretches of time.
In the past year alone, Mr Greenhill has taken the lead role in advising
General Motors on its several billion-dollar stock issues; worked with RJR
Nabisco on its plan to sell shares in its worldwide food business (a plan
that was formally unveiled yesterday); and advised International Business
Machines, the troubled computer company, on its massive restructuring.
Mr Greenhill said that after stepping down as president he would devote most
of his attention to working with these and other clients.
He will not, however, necessarily be working full-time at Morgan Stanley. Mr
Greenhill said some of his time will be spent on personal interests.

DISCUSSIONS between KLM, Swissair and Austrian Airlines are not expected to
result in a merger, Mr Harald Norvik, SAS chairman, expects.
Speaking at an industry forum in Bergen, Norway, he stressed that the
airlines were looking to co-operate more closely rather than combine.
There had been speculation that the four airlines might eventually merge
following last Friday's announcement that they were launching detailed talks
on the feasibility of setting up a 'global airline system'.
Mr Norvik said: 'The talks are aiming to establish if the conditions exist
for discussions on closer co-operation, and I don't think that a
collaboration would lead to a merger. The issue is what degree of
co-operation and co-ordination would be appropriate.' He said SAS was not
holding talks with any other airlines.
SAS, Swissair and Austrian Airlines already co-operate through a loose
grouping known as the European Quality Alliance, which involves joint
marketing activities and co-ordination of timetables.
It first became clear that KLM was interested in partnership talks with the
EQA airlines in late January.
Last Friday, the four groups said they were setting up joint working groups
to explore opportunities more closely.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sale sign erected over Cornerstone - Estate
agency loss totals Pounds 226m since acquisition in 1987
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER, Banking Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY NATIONAL yesterday disclosed that it had lost a total of Pounds 226m
on estate agency since it acquired its business in 1987.
The company now intends to sell the Cornerstone residential estate agency,
which has 355 branches.
The loss comprises Pounds 88m in total operating losses over five years, and
Pounds 126m in goodwill written off to reserves as well as a further Pounds
12m in restructuring costs in 1992.
Sir Christopher Tugendhat, Abbey chairman, said that the company had bought
the estate agency chain to protect its share of the mortgage lending market.
But its agents referred no more business proportionately than
intermediaries.
'The essential reason for buying it was to defend our flank. Since then, we
have discovered that it does not have that strategic advantage,' said Sir
Christopher.
The goodwill write-off, which was taken as an exceptional item because Abbey
is now complying with the FRS 3 reporting standard, leaves only Pounds 15m
of goodwill in reserves. Some Pounds 141m of goodwill was taken into
reserves on acquisition.
Abbey's decision to dispose of its estate agency business, which made a
trading loss of Pounds 20m (Pounds 19m) in 1992, contrasts with building
societies which are holding on to lossmaking chains in the hope that they
will return to profit.
The Cornerstone residential estate agency business, which achieved a small
increase in the number of houses sold, closed a further 59 branches as part
of rationalisation, compared with 16 branch closures in 1991.
Sir Christopher said it was 'always difficult to see the best of times or
the worst of times to sell something'. But Abbey believed it was sensible to
sell now amid signs of the housing market 'coming out of the doldrums'.
Abbey currently gains Pounds 500m a year of mortgage business through the
Cornerstone chain.
However, Sir Christopher said that Abbey had found it was getting a similar
flow of business through other estate agents that it did not own.
A large number of building societies - as Abbey was in 1987 - started to
acquire estate agency chains as a defensive measure because they believed
that their share of mortgage lending was threatened by new lenders.
Mr Peter Birch, Abbey chief executive, said that this fear proved to be
illusory. 'If we went back to that time, we would probably do the same thing
again. I hope that we would not do, but I think we probably would,' he said.
Woolwich Building Society disclosed last week that its Woolwich Property
Services estate agency business, which has 257 offices and is the seventh
largest corporate estate agent in Britain, incurred a trading loss of Pounds
11m during 1992.
If Abbey is unable to dispose of the chain as a whole, it will sell branches
in regional blocks.
It believes it will be able to achieve a higher price than the Pounds 15m of
goodwill remaining its its reserves after the write-off.
Abbey's move is one of the largest attempted disposals of a corporate chain
since Prudential disposed of or closed more than 500 of its branches during
1990.
Abbey is advised on the sale by Kleinwort Benson.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Concern over dividend cuts 10% off Raine
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Raine Industries fell by more than a tenth yesterday
despite the announcement by the UK housebuilder of a 14 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 2.8m during the six months to end-December.
A rise in group borrowings and concern over an uncovered interim dividend,
which was maintained at 2p, sent Raine's share price tumbling by 12p to
101p, reducing its stock market value by Pounds 22.5m.
Pre-tax profits would have fallen below last year's interim level of Pounds
2.4m if provisions for the six months to end-December 1991 of Pounds 3.4m,
to cover losses on Raine's 2.8 per cent strategic stake in rival
housebuilder YJ Lovell, had not been restated above the line.
The company revealed that since January 1 there had been a substantial
improvement in agreed sales and inquiries from would-be purchasers.
However, Mr Peter Parkin, chairman, said the improvement had come too late
to benefit the current financial year.
He blamed wild fluctuations in currency and interest rates last autumn,
which had hit housebuyers' confidence, and restricted sales during the
run-up to Christmas.
As a result, operating profits had fallen by 11.6 per cent during a first
half which had included the first full six months of sales from Walter
Lawrence.
Earnings, after taking account of the 1991 restated provision, rose from
0.27p to 0.83p.
In order to pay the maintained dividend the company will need to transfer
Pounds 2.19m from reserves.
Borrowings had risen since the end of June by Pounds 17m to Pounds 57m,
equivalent to 47 per cent of shareholders' funds.
Mr Parkin expected borrowings to get back to about Pounds 40m by the end of
June.
He added that the political and economic upheaval caused by sterling's
withdrawal from the ERM had caused tremendous damage to the confidence of
house buyers.
First half sales of 654 were about 180 less than the group had expected.
House prices and margins had remained under severe pressure, particularly in
the south-east.
However, Mr Parkin said that more recently there had been signs that prices
had begun to stabilise, reflecting an increase in demand.
The group's housing operation in California had continued to perform poorly
and incurred a first half loss.
UK contracting was also a difficult market with margins and orders under
severe pressure.
COMMENT
Raine's share price last night was only slightly ahead of the 95p rights
issues price in March last year when it acquired Walter Lawrence. The
company, however, appears willing to raid reserves to maintain the final
dividend provided the housing market does not dive again. It will need
pre-tax profits of at least Pounds 17m in 1993-94 to provide sufficient
earnings to maintain the dividend again. In the current financial year
pre-tax profits are likely to be about Pounds 11m compared with a restated
Pounds 10m for 1991-92. Borrowings, however, will be lower by June. The
group's land costs, one of the lowest in the sector, will stand it in good
stead as the housing market picks up. A prospective p/e approaching 30 for
the current financial year suggests the shares are not going anywhere in the
short term.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mike Knowles (right), who started his City career as a foreign exchange
dealer with the Bank of Tokyo nearly 30 years ago, has come out of
semi-retirement to take on the chairmanship of M W Marshall, one of the
world's biggest foreign exchange brokers.
Knowles, 50, has been assoc-iated with Marshalls since 1965 but retired
shortly after the Pounds 175m management buy-out from British &amp; Commonwealth
in February 1989. Although he is no longer involved in the day-to-day
management of Marshalls, he has remained a director of Marshalls Finance,
the holding company for the management buy-out.
He says that he was invited to return full-time to Marshalls after it was
decided to split Chris Kelson's role as chairman and chief executive.
Knowles says that the buy-out has gone 'very well' and the decision to split
Kelson's dual function was merely a reflection of current trends in
corp-orate governance.
Kelson remains chief executive and Tony Porter, head of Marshall's European
division, has been appointed managing director.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese motor manufacturer, was yesterday ordered to pay Pounds
6m to Nissan UK, its former British importer, for not honouring an agreement
to provide marketing support for sales of its range of Bluebird cars.
The Pounds 6m payment had been negotiated by Mr Octav Botnar, chairman of
Nissan UK, as an incentive for taking 12,700 of the cars in the six months
before they went out of production in 1990, the vice-chancellor, Sir Donald
Nicholls, said in the High Court.
Nissan had denied such an agreement had ever been reached. However, Sir
Donald ruled that an agreement had existed and that Nissan UK had fulfilled
its side of it.
Mr Botnar was not in court. He has remained in Switzerland following a
warrant for his arrest in connection with an alleged tax fraud.

Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NISSAN, the Japanese car maker, is to start exporting vehicles from its
Spanish plant in Barcelona to Japan next year with planned volumes of up to
12,000 a year.
Shipping four-wheel-drive (4WD) leisure/utility vehicles from Spain will be
the second export programme from Europe to Asia for Nissan, which already
exports up to 10,000 cars a year to Japan and Taiwan from its UK car plant
in Sunderland.
Nissan said it planned to export 10,000 units of its new Spanish-built
Terrano II four-wheel-drive vehicle to Japan in 1994, rising to 12,000 a
year.
Nissan Motor Iberica, its majority-owned Spanish subsidiary, said yesterday
that it had plunged into a loss of Pta14.37bn (Pounds 85.53m) last year in
the midst of its ambitious expansion programme.
Mr Juan Echevarria, Nissan Motor Iberica executive chairman, warned that the
company did not expect to return to profit before 1995.
Continuing losses and rising indebtedness, combined with the company's
commitment to a heavy capital expenditure programme, are expected to force a
capital restructuring.
Nissan Motor Iberica has spent more than Pta100bn on capital spending and
product development in the past two years, however, to try to transform
itself into a maker of vehicles for the European passenger car market based
on its Serena people carrier and the Terrano II.
It said yesterday it still planned to increase total vehicle production to
135,000 in 1995 from 79,450 last year. Output of the Serena is planned to
rise to 20,000 this year from 8,700 in 1992, and output of the Terrano II is
expected to increase from 35,700 this year to more than 64,000 in 1994
including the exports to Japan.
Some 22,000 Terrano IIs will be supplied to Ford, the US vehicle maker,
which will market the vehicle under the name Ford Maverick through its own
European dealer network.

NBC News yesterday announced the resignation of its president, Mr Michael
Gartner, in an attempt to limit damage to the news division of America's
third-ranking television network from the rigging of a broadcast test of a
General Motors truck last year.
Mr Gartner, president of the division since 1988, said he told NBC late last
year of his plans to leave in August. He said he had hastened his departure
announcement because of recent controversies.
In November, NBC's Dateline current affairs programme aired pictures of a
blazing GM truck without telling its 11m viewers that it had attached small
incendiary devices to the truck to make it burst into flames during a
collision.
In February, NBC issued an on-air apology to GM, America's biggest carmaker,
after it launched a suit for defamation against the network. GM is
struggling against bad publicity over the safety of its C/K pick-up trucks
built between 1973 and 1987, which have been the subject of lawsuits and
government investigations.
An internal investigation of the GM affair is expected to be completed this
week. Mr Don Browne, NBC News executive vice-president, will assume Mr
Gartner's responsibilities while the network searches for a successor.
This is not the only search going on at NBC. The network's parent, General
Electric, is believed to be interested in selling NBC if it can get the
right price.

FT  03 MAR 93 / Malaysia may buy Dollars 700m Mig fighters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE cold war might be over but the arms race continues. For the past two
days Mr Alexander Rutskoi, vice-president of Russia, has been acting as an
arms salesman in Malaysia.
The Malaysian air force wants a new generation of fighter aircraft. After
considering French and Anglo-German-Italian fighters, the choice has come
down to the Russian Mig 29, the General Dynamics F-16 or the McDonnell
Douglas F/A-18. The value of the initial fighter contract is estimated at
anywhere between Dollars 700m (Pounds 493m) and Dollars 1bn.
This increasingly hard-nosed battle between Russia and the US comes at a
time of growing defence spending in many Asian countries. Nervousness has
set in following the closure of US bases in the Philippines. There is
concern that conflicts might arise over ownership of the Spratlys - a group
of islands in the South China Sea claimed by China, Vietnam, Taiwan,
Malaysia, the Philippines and Brunei.
The increasing power of China's armed forces is worrying many in the region.
China purchased nearly Dollars 2bn worth of arms from Russia last year,
including advanced Su-27 fighters, and is considering buying a Russian
aircraft carrier.
Yesterday, in a meeting with Dr Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime
minister, Mr Rutskoi is believed to have offered to set up various spare
parts and technical facilities in Malaysia for the Mig. Malaysia's defence
spending is rising by more than 20 per cent this year.
'It is in our interests to see that there will be no vacuum in the region,
as it may result in a new area of conflict,' says Mr Najib Abdul Razak,
Malaysia's defence minister.
Last month Malaysia signed a memorandum of understanding with India on
defence co-operation. India, which already builds and operates the Mig 29,
may help Malaysia establish its new fighter force. McDonnell Douglas and
General Dynamics have countered by offering what are said to be considerably
reduced sale prices for their fighters. A US delegation was here last month
in an effort to thwart the Russian bid.
Initially the Malaysian air force is expected to buy between 16 and 20
fighters, with options on 40 more. Russia is also believed to be offering to
sell Malaysia a number of its large Mig 35 helicopter gunships and a variety
of other weaponry.
The Russians say the Migs can be delivered within six months. US
manufacturers are likely to take considerably longer. Russia is also
reported to be willing to accept some form of barter payment from Malaysia
for a portion of the sale - possibly palm oil.
Military analysts say that by buying the Migs Malaysia would upset a growing
trend towards air force co-operation inside the Association of South East
Asian Nations (Asean). Other Asean air forces have western equipment. If
Malaysia does buy Migs it will be the first big arms sale by Russia in the
Asean region.
Indonesia, the Philippines and Burma are all at present being courted by
Russia's arms dealers. Earlier this year Indonesia announced plans to buy 39
vessels belonging to the former East German navy, all made in what was the
Soviet Union.

FT  03 MAR 93 / (CORRECTED) UK Company News: AIB shows IPounds 171.6m thanks
to US side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Correction (published 4th March 1993) appended to this article.
A STRONG performance by First Maryland Bancorp, its US subsidiary, largely
helped Allied Irish Banks, Ireland's largest clearing bank, achieve better
than expected pre-tax profits of IPounds 171.6m (Pounds 177m) for the nine
months ended December 31 1992.
The result was produced despite deteriorating trading conditions in Ireland.
Mr Gerry Scanlan, group chief executive, said: 'Excellent results in the US
and significant improvement in Britain compensated for the lack of growth in
Ireland, which reflected the uncertain market conditions for our customers'.
The group has changed its year-end reporting date from March 31 to December
31 this year consolidating the different reporting dates of the group's
various subsidiaries, making comparison difficult with the 1992 results to
March 31 1992, when pre-tax profits of IPounds 185.8m were reported.
However, due to improved tax management, the post-tax profits of IPounds
107.6m for the nine months compare favourably with IPounds 104.7m for the
previous 12-month period.
Profits growth of 23 per cent was reported at First Maryland which
contributed 43 per cent of total group profits for the nine months period.
Losses in the UK division were down to IPounds 25.6m for the nine months,
compared with IPounds 47m for the previous full year, while the Ireland
division, which includes results from its TSB subsidiary in Northern
Ireland, reported IPounds 129.5m in pre-tax profits for the nine month
period compared with IPounds 172.6m for 1992.
Profits in the Republic, however, were significantly down (by some 20 per
cent on an annualised basis) to IPounds 72.7m from IPounds 121.4m between
the two reporting periods.
Loan loss provisions were IPounds 143.3m for the nine months (IPounds
178.3m) and the the group's Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio has again
improved, from 6.6 per cent to 7.2 per cent.
A final dividend of 4.2p is recommended, giving a total of 8p for the
period. On an annualised basis this equals 8.7p, an increase of 5.5 per cent
over 1991-92.
Market analysts anticipate pre-tax profits in the region of IPounds 220m and
earnings per share of 21p for 1993.
COMMENT
AIB executives remain upbeat about performance in the group's core Irish
market for the year ahead. But the sharp downturn in the last quarter of
1992, triggered by the sterling crisis, high interest rates and a loss of
business confidence, will only be partially offset by the punt's devaluation
at the beginning of this year. Continuing high interest rates, weak
sterling, and ERM instability give little cause for corporate optimism.
Growing loan loss provisions and tighter profit margins would seem a more
likely scenario for 1993. Thus the group's 'engine for growth' appears to
have chugged off to the other side of the Atlantic, where First Maryland has
built up a good head of steam ready to take advantage of the Clinton
economic recovery.
CORRECTION
Allied Irish Banks' profits in the Republic of Ireland, reported in
Wednesday's FT, should have read IPounds 76.7m (Pounds 78.2m) and not
IPounds 72.7m. On an annualised basis this gives a 15.7 per cent downturn
compared to 1991-92, not 20 per cent.

FT  03 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Loan notes sale boosts Norex
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOREX, the financial services group, made a Pounds 28.7m profit on the sale
of loan notes in Global Marine, the American oil rig company.
This boosted pre-tax profit from Pounds 2.26m to Pounds 28.1m for the six
months to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 4.18m (Pounds 4.67m).
Three years ago Norex America and its partners bought about Dollars 240m
(Pounds 169m) of Global Marine's debt, becoming the main creditors after the
rig builder emerged from Chapter 11.
Norex America, in which the UK group has a 48 per cent stake, took Dollars
134m on to its own books, buying it at a 32 per cent discount to face value.
Global Marine has bought back the outstanding debt at 96 per cent of face
value. Norex America received Dollars 99m gross, of which Dollars 29m was
used to repay bank loans.
In the interim up to Dollars 8m a year has been earned on the difference
between interest received on the loan notes and interest paid on the
associated debt.
Mr Kristian Siem, the Norwegian entrepreneur who is managing director of
Norex and chairman of Norex America, said cash from the sale of a cruise
business had been invested in the Global Marine loan notes.
'It so happened it was easier and cheaper to acquire the debt than to buy
companies directly. The debt was never converted to equity and we are
delighted with the dividends and the profit.'
Norex America would look for further opportunities on the marine side,
concentrating more on the financial angles than on actual operation. 'There
is a role to play when banks are not lending and we are in a capital
intensive business,' Mr Siem said.
Results of Norex, announced yesterday, showed an operating profit of Pounds
855,000 (Pounds 4.84m). Insurance broking was ahead of expectations and
losses were cut in the executive travel agency.
After a minority charge of Pounds 17.7m, attributable profit stood at Pounds
10.4m. Earnings per share were 112.51p (4.95p) and again no interim dividend
is declared.
Norex is 42 per cent owned by a Bermuda-based trust with members of Mr
Siem's family as its beneficiaries.

David Roberts-Jones has resigned as non-executive director from ALLIANCE
RESOURCES, the US-based oil and gas company which has been in administrative
receivership since October. Roberts-Jones was the last director remaining
from the original board which floated Alliance in 1991. John O'Brien,
managing director of Manx Petroleum - which put Alliance into receivership -
is chairman of Alliance. An attempt by fellow directors to unseat O'Brien
failed last year.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Grafton ahead 9% to IPounds
3.87m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GRAFTON GROUP, the Dublin-based builders' merchant and DIY concern, reported
a 9 per cent advance in pre-tax profits from IPounds 3.55m to IPounds 3.87m
(Pounds 3.96m) in the year to end-December.
The outcome was achieved on turnover up by IPounds 1.98m to IPounds 96.4m.
Mr Michael Chadwick, chairman, said that trading during the nine months to
September had been strong but the impact of lower construction activity, as
a result of higher interest rates and reduced confidence, had been felt in
the last quarter.
However, the overall financial position remained healthy, he added, with
cash of IPounds 2.6m being generated during the year. Gearing was cut from
31 per cent to 22 per cent.
Earnings per share worked through at 18.6p (17.1p). A maintained final
dividend of 3.75p raises the total for the year to 6.5p (6.25p).

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: US group denies interest in
Greencore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARCHER-Daniels-Midlands, the US agribusiness group, yesterday quashed
speculation that it planned to take a stake in Greencore, the Irish sugar
and foods group which is 30 per cent owned by the government.
Mr Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Illinois-based ADM, said yesterday that the
group had been approached a month ago with a view to buying the Irish
government's stake. However, the terms and conditions offered had been
unacceptable. 'There did not seem to be any way to reach agreement,' he
said. There had been no further contact.
Speculation surrounding the fate of the government's stake - the legacy of
the group's privatisation in 1991 - resulted in the suspension of Greencore
shares at 245p yesterday.
The company said the shares would be suspended for 48 hours pending
clarification of the government's position on the future of its holding.
The cabinet is expected to make a statement this morning. In the budget
speech last month, the government said it intended to raise IPounds 150m in
12 months through the disposal of state assets - believed to be the
Greencore holding and a 45 per cent stake in Irish Life.
The company is believed to have held discussions with the potential
investor, and it is thought unlikely a full bid would result. The
govern-ment holds a golden share, and is likely to expect under-takings on
certain issues such as employment and the maintaining of Ireland's sugar
quota.
Possible investors include Conagra and Cargill, both of the US. Reports
cited an offer price of Pounds 65m for the stake, or 260p per share. The
government is unlikely to accept such a price, however, having disposed of
15 per cent of Greencore last year at 265p.
Analysts speculated that an offer pitched at between 270p and 275p would
succeed.
ADM, known to be keen to expand in Europe, was widely favoured as the most
likely purchaser of the stake. ADM already owns 7.4 per cent of Tate &amp; Lyle.
It was also noted that Mr Gerry Murphy, Greencore's chief executive, is
known to ADM. He was formerly a senior executive of Grand Metropolitan's
Pillsbury operations in the US, which has a joint venture with ADM in flour
milling.
Analysts in Dublin said they would welcome the sale of the government's
stake. 'It would preclude Greencore fund raising in Dublin and bring at
least Pounds 65m into the exchequer,' said Mr Joe Gill, an analyst with
Dublin brokers, Riada.
Mr Gill said speculation that Greencore would have to come to the market for
funds had helped to depress the share price in recent weeks.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Names in action to recover losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 2,000 Lloyd's Names are to issue writs against their agents today,
kicking off one of the largest actions in English legal history in terms of
the number of individual plaintiffs and defendants.
The 2,145 Names - individuals whose assets support the Lloyd's market - are
seeking to recover Pounds 396m in insurance losses.
The Names were members of Gooda Walker syndicates 164, 290, 298 and 298,
which specialised in 'spiral' reinsurance, in which syndicates and London
market companies reinsure each other's exposure to high-level catastrophe
loss.
Advised by Wilde Sapte, they are suing 67 members' agents who placed them on
the syndicates.
Mr Michael Deeny, chairman of the Gooda Walker Action Group, which is
organising the action, said the average loss by each Name is Pounds 184,877.
But he added: 'Some individual members have lost up to Pounds 1m. Some of
these were underwriting at Lloyd's on the basis of a bank guarantee secured
on their family home and had no other substantial assets.'
Mr Deeny, an accountant and rock music promoter, said that many of the Names
involved are old-age pensioners who 'now face total ruin'.
The action group has raised more than Pounds 4m from its Names to fight the
action, which could begin in commercial court next year. A final result may
take many years, however.
The main action is focused on allegations of negligent underwriting, but
litigation on other issues and against other parties is being considered and
further proceedings may be issued shortly.
Mr Deeny said that the official Lloyd's loss review report into the Gooda
Walker syndicates revealed a 'picture of almost incredible incompetence'.
He described the 'spiral' as a 'financial timebomb which has brought
disaster to Names on the Gooda Walker syndicates'.

Consolidated pre-tax profits at Tabacalera, the state-owned Spanish tobacco
monopoly, are understood to have fallen by more than 13 per cent to
Pta18.9bn (dollars 161m) last year, despite a small 3.5 per cent pre-tax
profit increase, to Pta20bn, at the parent company itself, writes Peter
Bruce in Madrid.
The group figures are understood to have been hit by poor results from the
Philip Morris operation in Spain, in which Tabacalera has a 50 per cent
stake, and by the incorporation of Elosua, the loss-making edible oils
group, of which Tabacalera took control last year.
Unofficial figures have Tabacalera's 1992 group sales 7.6 per cent up at
Pta700.4bn. The group is a potential candidate for some form of
privatisation later this year, and is also on the verge of selling its Royal
Brands foods subsidiary.

TEKSID, the metallurgical products subsidiary of Italy's Fiat group, and
Canada's Alcan Aluminium company are forming a US joint venture for the
automotive industry.
The new company, Altek Automotive Castings, will be based in Detroit and
will include Alcan's automotive castings plant in St Catherines, Ontario.
The joint venture excludes Teksid's aluminium facility in Tennessee, which
has already established a strong position selling aluminium products to the
big three US car producers.
The joint venture will aim to develop and manufacture cast and composite
aluminium components for the car industry.
Alcan is one of the world's largest aluminium producers, while Teksid is a
leading foundry group specialising in products for the automotive industry.
Group sales amounted to L1,160bn (dollars 730m) last year. The joint venture
will focus on the North American market. Altek's initial activity will
involve making cast lower control arms for Ford's new Lincoln Continental
model.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Italian corruption scandal widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER official of the Italian Communist party (PCI) was arrested
yesterday by Milan magistrates on suspicion of operating a Swiss bank
account to receive pay-offs from contracts in the power industry.
The arrest of Mr Primo Greganti, an official in the Turin branch of the PCI
during 1970-87, is part of the widening national investigation into
corruption in which a growing number of senior political and busi ness
leaders have been implicated.
Mr Greganti voluntarily appeared for questioning in Milan yesterday and was
later arrested for alleged corruption and illicit financing of the party.
It is the first time Italian companies have been linked to alleged payments
to the PCI made illicitly outside the country. Corruption in the power
industry is one of the main lines of investigation now being pursued by
Milan magistrates.
According to magistrates, Mr Greganti had been identified by Mr Lorenzo
Panzavolta, the head of Calcestruzzi, the construction and cement arm of
Ferruzzi, as the recipient of L620m (Dollars 401,000) paid into a Swiss bank
account for the PCI in respect of a contract with Enel, the state
electricity authority. This is not the first time the corruption scandals
have involved the PCI, which has sought to present itself as clean. Mr
Giovanni Batista Zorzoli, the PCI representative on the board of Enel, has
been arrested. The PCI was dissolved in 1990 and its mantle was taken was up
by the newly created Party of the Democratic Left (PDS) of which Mr Greganti
was a member. The PDS yesterday vigorously denied any knowledge of the
payment and further denied possessing a Swiss bank account.
Milan magistrates also arrested and placed on bail yesterday Mr Arturo
Romagnoli, a businessman and the brother of Mr Vincenzo Romagnoli, former
owner of the construction company Cogefar. Mr Romagnoli was alleged to have
been involved in corruption related to Milan municipal contracts.
In another development likely to prove embarrassing to the Christian
Democrats, Mr Michele de Mita, the brother of former prime minister Ciriaco
de Mita, currently head of the parliamentary institutional reform
commission, was arrested on fraud charges. Mr Michele de Mita was alleged to
have been part of a scheme which submitted fake invoices for potatoes
supplied to earthquake victims at Irpinia in southern Italy in 1980.

<TEXT>
THE man considered by police to be the financial brains behind the Medelln
cocaine cartel has surrendered to authorities, the attorney general's office
said yesterday, AP reports from Bogota.
Mr Jose Fernando Posada, 38, turned himself over to representatives of the
Medelln prosecutors' office waiting outside a cinema on Sunday night.
He was taken to a maximum security prison outside Medelln where 17 other
cartel members are being held.
Mr Posada was the fourth leading cartel member to surrender in recent weeks
under a government offer of leniency. Authorities say the surrenders are
weakening the organisation led by fugitive drug lord Mr Pablo Escobar.
Meanwhile, a wealthy Medelln businessman who is reported to have links to Mr
Escobar was killed yesterday after being abducted from his home by about
20-25 gunmen, police said.
The abduction and murder came 48 hours after an attack on the home of his
brother, Mr Diego Londono White, an architect who has said he once worked
for Mr Escobar.
Mr Diego Londono White told Medelln television that the gunmen were members
of People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar, a secretive group that has pledged to
kill Mr Escobar.
Reuter adds: Colombian authorities seized nearly Dollars 5.9m in more than
890 domestic bank accounts and arrested 250 people during a 15-month
crackdown on drug traffickers' money-laundering networks, the Colprensa news
service said on Sunday.
Quoting police, Colprensa said Colombian authorities and Interpol uncovered
the main networks used by the Cali and Medelln drug cartels in a 15-month
investigation.
It said the cartels moved their money through fictitious export and import
companies and money exchange houses.

<TEXT>
HOECHST, one of the three giant German chemical companies, has been accused
of reacting too slowly after it sprayed about 10 tonnes of chemicals  - some
potentially toxic  - over a Frankfurt suburb, writes Clive Cookson in
Frankfurt.
Hoechst insists there is no danger to residents from exposure they have
received. Company officals say the direct costs of the accident, which
happened a week ago, will be at least DM10m (Dollars 6.14m) and perhaps
several times more.
At least 10 different chemicals were discharged in the accident at its
Griesheim plant, the company said yesterday after analysing soil samples.
Some of the chemicals are potentially toxic or caustic. They include two
tonnes of ortho-nitroanisole, a smelly, yellow chemical used to make dyes,
which the company says is 'potentially carcinogenic.'
State government officials say Hoechst responded too slowly to the accident
and failed to disclose details on what the chemicals are and their potential
toxicity.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Bonn accepts return of its toxic waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY has agreed to re-import some 420 tonnes of toxic waste, including
leaking barrels of chemicals, pesticides, paints and varnishes, illegally
exported to Romania from both east and west Germany in recent years, writes
Quentin Peel.
The plan follows a campaign by Greenpeace, the environmental action group,
which threatened to bring the waste back to Bonn itself and dump it in the
German capital.
The operation, which involves decanting the waste into new containers and
shipping it back to Germany in a special goods train, will start this week,
Mr Klaus Topfer, the environment minister, announced yesterday.
It will cost DM3.3m (Dollars 1.98m) of taxpayers' money, the minister said.
However he promised to pursue the illegal exporters to pay compensation.
The waste is dumped in and near the town of Sibiu, in central Romania, where
many of the containers have corroded, or broken open in the frost, and
started leaking their contents, according to Greenpeace.
Mr Topfer yesterday praised the action group for its campaign, and promised
that the waste would now be disposed of inside Germany. He said that most of
it came from the former East Germany, mainly from the Bitterfeld chemical
industry complex in Saxony-Anhalt, but some also came from western
enterprises.

FT  02 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Sell note hits Abbey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABBEY National, the building society turned high street bank which came to
the market at 130p a share in July 1989, raced up to an all-time high early
yesterday before turning off sharply as UBS Phillips &amp; Drew issued a
straight 'sell' recommendation on the stock ahead of this morning's
preliminary figures.
UBS expects Abbey to record an 8 per cent fall in profits to Pounds 570m.
Analysts expect the dividend total to be lifted some 10 per cent to around
11.5p.
Following the UBS recommendation the shares retreated to 387p, before
staging a late rally and closing only a penny off at 397p. Turnover in the
stock totalled 4.8m shares.
UBS analyst Mr John Wriglesworth said he recommended the sale of the shares
for a number of reasons, chiefly recent outperformance that has seen them
outpace the market by 10 per cent in the past two weeks.
He added: 'Bad debts will remain a big problem and we do not expect house
prices to rise this year. Added to that, Abbey's margins will be squeezed by
the commercial banks and mortgage specialists. And they will be hit on the
savings side by the government.' Mr Wriglesworth said he expected no
pleasant surprises in the figures or at the post-results meeting.
Gen Accident firm
Recent worries that a big rights issue might be on the way from General
Accident tended to fade into the background yesterday, giving shares in the
composite insurer a substantial boost. The rights issue fears had been
triggered by the fund raising carried out by Commercial Union, which
launched a Pounds 450m-plus rights issue and the Pounds 100m bond issue made
by Royal Insurance.
GA closed a net 26 higher at 595p, a rise of 4.6 per cent, compared with the
0.5 per cent rise in the market and a 2.5 per cent increase in the composite
insurance sub-sector.
The company's preliminary figures are expected this morning, with the market
range extending from a Pounds 20m to a Pounds 45m loss, compared with last
year's deficit of Pounds 172m. Analysts said the figures could reveal a
strong improvement in results from motor insurance following rate increases.
Tate &amp; Lyle weak
The news that the chief executive at UK sweeteners group Tate &amp; Lyle was to
leave the company caused the stock to buck the strong market trend.
At the day's worst the shares were down 7 at 430p, although dealers said
there was no significant selling at the lower levels. Bargain hunting,
together with the strong market, helped the shares recover some of the
earlier fall and they closed 3 off at 434p after trade of 2.5m. Several
analysts were concerned that the departure signalled deeper trading worries
at the group.
There was no shortage of strong performers in the financial areas of the
market. Standard Chartered delivered another good showing, climbing 17 more
to 685p, the highest level since the great crash of October 1987. Standard
is scheduled to report preliminary figures on March 10. Lloyds rose 9 to
528p, albeit in relatively light trade. Barclays ended a fraction harder at
425p as the market continued the debate over whether the dividend will be
cut on Thursday when the full-year figures are released. The probable
flotation of some of its insurance subsidiaries saw Hambros Bank edge up 3
to 316p.
A Smith New Court buy recommendation helped Prudential move ahead strongly
to finish 8 1/2 up at 324p. Other life shares also did well, Lloyds Abbey
closing 4 1/2 ahead at 426p and Legal &amp; General 4 better at 475p.
Composite insurances attracted keen buying across the board. Guardian Royal,
reporting preliminaries tomorrow, settled 6 higher at 193p. Sun Alliance
rose 10 to 333p.
Continuing fears that the March 10 figures will see the dividend cut failed
to prevent a bounce in Willis Corroon, which ended 5 firmer at 185p. Lloyd
Thompson, regarded as the best quality stock in the smaller insurance
brokers, advanced 9 more to 290p.
Confirmation that Airtours was to raise its offer for its bid target Owners
Abroad to 135p a share saw the stock of both companies gain further
strength, as several market watchers came to the view that the new offer
might be just high enough to clinch the deal.
Owners closed 3 up at 134p xd, while Airtours also firmed 3, to 309p, Mr
Hamish Dixon at Hoare Govett said: 'I believe the improved offer represents
fair value and the bid now stands a better chance of success.'
A press suggestion that both Rank Organisation and Carlton Communications
may soon face stiff competition for their video copying operations hurt the
shares of both companies as each made a dividend payout. Shares in Rank gave
up 20 to 667p xd, while those in Carlton retreated 19 to 778p xd. Analysts
were, however, sceptical, saying it is an old story, and one said: 'If it is
plausible it is a long way off.'
Thorn EMI continued Friday's bounce, shrugging off recent weakness, and
added 17 at 859p.
British Gas touched an all-time high of 303p before easing back to close a
net 3 1/2 up at 301 1/2 p, after the call by Ofgas, the gas industry
regulator, for a break-up of the company into 12 independently owned
regional gas supply companies.
De La Rue staged a strong rally after the recent bout of weakness, closing a
net 18 higher at 672p.
BT moved up 5 1/2 more to 423 1/2 p, with marketmakers sensing that the
campaign to sell the government's remaining 21.8 per cent stake - labelled
BT III - is beginning to warm up.
Ferranti was the market's most heavily traded stock, with 21m shares
changing hands following strong hints that the group will be a major
beneficiary of the huge Al-Yamamah defence contract with Saudi Arabia.
Ferranti closed 1 1/2 firmer at 15 1/4 p.
Electrocomponents climbed 8 to 383p and Farnell 3 to 360p after Hoare Govett
reaffirmed its strong buy stance on both stocks and upgraded its profits
forecast for the latter. Citing good growth in sales during the past six
months, Hoare increased its current year forecast for Farnell from Pounds
56m to Pounds 59m and that for next year from Pounds 59m to Pounds 62m.
Shares in engineering company James Wilkes jumped 18 to 66p in heavy trading
of 2.2m shares as speculation of a bid from Suter swept through the market.
Shortly after the market close, it was announced that Suter had indeed been
the day's big buyer and now has an 8.9 per cent stake in the engineering
group. It said, however, that it had taken no further decisions about
further action. Shares in Suter closed unchanged at 135p.
Favourable weekend press comment boosted TI Group and the shares moved 8
ahead to 298p in trade of 2m.
Shares in British Aerospace were weak and closed at 261p xd as analysts
reflected on Friday afternoon's meeting with the company, the second meeting
following last week's results. One aerospace watcher reflected: 'The company
still has a lot to do with little room to manouevre given the poor balance
sheet.' Rolls-Royce eased 1 1/2 to 132p in sympathy.
The view that Cadbury Schweppes was not about to buy chocolate maker Terrys,
funding the acquisition through a rights issue, continued to gain ground and
the shares hardened 5 to 471p, with turnover reaching 3.9m by the close.
Many expect good results when the group reports figures next week, but
several analysts remain negative and have suggested that current year
earnings are likely to suffer as a result of a large rise in raw material
prices.
Among the food retailers, Hillsdown Holdings and Wm Morrison Supermarkets
were wanted. The former, which reports figures next week, added 3 at 161p
and the latter gained 3 at 161p.

FT  02 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DERIVATIVES markets provided the driving force behind the rise in the FT-SE
100 Index to a new closing peak yesterday, but appeared to lose heart
towards the end of the day, writes Terry Byland.
The March contract on the FT-SE Index set the pace, opening with a premium
of around 10 points against the cash market, a strong performance compared
with a discount of around 4 points on the fair value calculation which
allows for carrying costs and dividend flows on the basket of Footsie stocks
making up the contract.
A healthy arbitrage opportunity between futures and cash was seized by some
UK houses. However, futures traders said that business in their market was
not particularly heavy - the March contract finally traded 2,884 contracts,
an unimpressive total.
The contract held its premium at the official close when persistent selling
by a Scandinavian bank was counteracted by demand from locals, or
independent traders. After the offical close, however, the contract slipped
back further from the day's peak to show little change from the final
reading on the FT-SE Index itself.
Traded options business fell to 18,536 bargains from nearly 30,000 on
Friday, with the FT-SE trading only 7,093 and the Euro FT-SE 1,017. Asda
headed the individual stocks list with 1,049 lots.

FT  02 MAR 93 / London Stock Exchange: New closing peak for the Footsie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK stock market moved comfortably to a new peak yesterday, encouraged by
favourable comments on the outlook for German interest rates by Mr Helmut
Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, but it left share traders unsure
whether the new ground had been securely captured. The driving force came
from stock index futures, and genuine investment interest in equities was
undramatic.
After opening lower on ex-dividend adjustments in nine stocks in the Footsie
list, the market turned sharply higher at 8.35am when the March contract on
the FT-SE 100 Index started trading with a burst of strength.
The previous closing high of 2,873.8 on the Footsie was quickly left behind
and a gain of more than 16 points raised hopes that the existing intra-day
peak of 2,900.1 might be challenged.
It was soon clear, however, that there was insufficient institutional demand
to push the market above the mid-morning level of 2,884.9. Ex-dividend
changes held the Footsie back by about 7 points and, although the March
future contract maintained a good premium, the stock market settled down for
a closing reading on the FT-SE 100 of 2,882.6 to leave an advance on the day
of 14.6.
At least one basket trade - a series of deals between the futures sector and
the underlying blue chip stocks - was identified, but traders described the
session as 'essentially boring'. With Wall Street a mere 5.68 Dow points
ahead in UK hours, the London market was lethargic in the final hour of
business.
Seaq volume of 535.1m shares fell short of Friday's total of 671.3m, which
was worth Pounds 1.41bn in retail terms. Non-Footsie stocks made up around
67 per cent of yesterday's Seaq volume, and the FT-SE Mid 250 Index gained
13.6 to end at 3,049.7, just short of its all-time high.
In reviving optimistic views on the interest rate outlook, the stock market
chose to focus on Mr Schlesinger's forecast after last weekend's meeting of
Group of Seven finance ministers of a decline in German money market rates.
It also elected to ignore Mr Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer, who
said following the same meeting that he did not envisage cutting UK rates at
present. Stock market traders saw the firmness of sterling as an encouraging
sign that the chancellor will feel able to cut rates around Budget Day,
March 16.
The first day of the new equity market account was also featured by caution
ahead of the continued flow this week of trading statements from blue chip
British companies. Abbey National, Fisons, General Accident and BICC are
reporting this week and Thursday brings the important trading and dividend
statement from Barclays Bank. Several of these names are also on the
market's list of possible fund-raisers by means of rights issues in the
equity market.
Shell, Rank Organisation and Carlton Communications all took their
ex-dividend moves badly yesterday. With these technical factors now taken
aboard, the focus today is likely to be on the March stock index future.
Traders will be watching closely to see if the FT-SE 100 Index can break
through 2,900 convincingly; the March contract remained well short of this
level in late trading yesterday.

FT  02 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (America): Friday's blast leads to dull
equity trading
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARES lost ground yesterday afternoon after starting the day on a
modestly firmer note, with some traders suggesting that Friday's bomb blast
at the World Trade Center was having a delayed psychological effect on the
equity market, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
Although there was no direct impact from the blast on either the New York
Stock Exchange or the American Stock Exchange, which are housed in a
different part of Manhattan's financial district, some market participants
said the explosion underlined the area's vulnerability to terrorist attack.
Dealing yesterday morning began quietly, and end of day volume was somewhat
below recent levels.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally down 15.40 at 3,355.41. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 1.37 at 442.01, while the American SE composite
was 0.70 firmer at 407.54. The Nasdaq composite shed 1.26 to 669.51. Trading
volume on the New York SE was 237m shares.
The only economic data yesterday had little influence on the market. The
National Association of Purchasing Management's survey of business activity
in February showed the first decline since September, with the index
standing at 55.8 last month compared with 58 in January.
Many of the most actively traded 'mainline' stocks were mixed throughout the
day. Wal-Mart Stores gained Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 33 and IBM rose Dollars
 3/8 to Dollars 54 3/4 . Two of the drug stocks rallied, Glaxo improving
Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 19 1/4 and Merck Dollars 1 to Dollars 39 1/2 .
By contrast, Philip Morris continued to feel the weight of worries about a
tobacco tax and ended Dollars 1 7/8 lower at Dollars 65 1/4 . Compaq
Computer also declined sharply, by Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 41 7/8 , while
Chrysler slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 39 1/4 .
Among some of the smaller stocks, Thermedics, a bomb detection equipment
maker, rallied in the wake of the World Trade Center blast, by Dollars 1 5/8
to Dollars 13 1/2 . Sensormatic climbed Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 35 1/8 on
news that Wal-Mart, the nation's top-selling retailer, plans to install the
company's electronic article surveillance system in more than 100 additional
stores.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed mixed for the third consecutive trading day in active
trading. The TSE 300 index lost 19 points to 3,432.7, but rises outnumbered
falls by 333 to 288 after volume of 44.2m shares.
The mining sector posted the day's biggest loss - 1.69 per cent. Alcan
Aluminium, which said it has formed a 50:50 joint venture with a Fiat
subsidiary to produce components for the automotive industry, declined
CDollars 5/8 to CDollars 23 3/8.

SAO PAULO dropped by 5.5 per cent yesterday as investors continued to sell
after the resignation of Mr Paulo Haddad, Brazil's economy minister. At the
close the Bovespa index was 777 points lower at 13,267.
Brokers said the market was anxious about inflation, currently running at
around 27 per cent a month, the timing of a new economic programme and the
possibility of a delay in Brazil's imminent talks with the International
Monetary Fund.

FT  02 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Tokyo Steel earnings
downgrade leaves Nikkei lower
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS over lower corporate earnings, triggered by a Nomura Research
Institute (NRI) report, unnerved investors and share prices finished lower
after thin trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed 73.75 down at 16,879.60 after a day's high of
16,971.00 and low of 16,821.31. The index firmed in early trading on buying
of telecommunications stocks, but fell later on selling prompted by fears
over lower corporate profits.
Volume dwindled to 170m shares from 266m, while declines led advances by 664
to 265, with 198 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks shed 7.96 to 1,276.25, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased
0.50 to 1,027.03.
A report by Nomura Research Institute, projecting that Tokyo Steel, a
leading electric furnace steel maker, would fall into the red next fiscal
year, prompted heavy selling. Investors were shocked by the report, as the
company has been a market favourite due to its high profitability relative
to blast furnace steel makers.
NRI revised its earnings forecast for Tokyo Steel to a pre-tax loss of
Y3.5bn from a pre-tax profit of Y20bn for the year ending March next year,
stemming from a plunge in demand for steel bars. NRI said Tokyo Steel could
cut its dividend as a result of the loss.
Tokyo Steel dropped Y370 to Y2,130, while other electric furnace steel
makers also lost ground. Toa Steel fell Y64 to Y919 and Yamato Kogyo Y100 to
Y1,100. Blast furnace steel makers were also weak, Nippon Steel losing Y5 to
Y292.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone gained Y15,000 at Y631,000 on active buying.
The issue has risen 6.9 per cent over the past month on reports that the
telecommunications group wants to raise its call rates.
Showa Shell Sekiyu, the oil refiner which came under heavy selling pressure
last week on its huge foreign currency loss, fell a further Y26 to Y775.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 59.13 to 18,046.48 in volume of 48.1m
shares. Trading on the OSE surged 30.5 per cent last month from January to
1,297.4m shares. OSE officials said that active cross trading, or selling
and buying back shares to realise profits on stock holdings, ahead of the
March financial year-end had pushed up activity.
Roundup
WITH THE exception of Bangkok and Singapore, the region showed strong
performances yesterday.
BANGKOK saw the banking sector lose more than 5 per cent on rumours that
Bangkok Bank was facing substantial bad debts. The SET index closed 27.13,
or some 3 per cent, lower at 910.52 in turnover of Bt4.1bn.
The bank issued a statement denying the rumours, which had started to
circulate after last Thursday's announcement of a capital increase from
Bt10bn to Bt20bn. The shares weakened Bt8 to Bt115.
HONG KONG finished near to its record peak as investors began to anticipate
good annual results due later this week. The Hang Seng index climbed 46.83
to 6,398.82 in turnover of HKDollars 4.4bn.
Hang Seng Bank advanced HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 64 and Hutchison Whampoa 20
cents to HKDollars 17.90.
AUSTRALIA closed at its highest level for seven months after the release of
the lowest monthly current account deficit in five years. The All Ordinaries
index appreciated 29.7 to 1,639.3 in turnover of ADollars 334.6m.
The banking sector was very strong, with NAB rising 25 cents to ADollars
8.40, Commonwealth 17 cents to ADollars 6.90 and Westpac 11 cents to
ADollars 3.19.
SINGAPORE was weaker on profit-taking as many investors chose to ignore
Friday's budget which came after the close. The Straits Times Industrial
index slipped 5.60 to 1,658.90 in volume of 166m shares.
TAIWAN ended at an eight-month high, while turnover, at TDollars 78.4bn, was
at its heaviest level since May, 1991. The weighted index rose 132.92, or 3
per cent, to 4,517.59.
The electronics sector was particularly active, with Acer up 80 cents at
TDollars 25.60.
NEW ZEALAND was encouraged both by Australia's performance and by gains in
FCL, Carter Holt Harvey and Telecom, as the NZSE-40 index gained 21.01 at
1,587.04 in low turnover of NZDollars 25m.
FCL moved ahead 10 cents to NZDollars 2.49, Carter Holt Harvey 5 cents to
NZDollars 2.94 and Telecom 4 cents to NZDollars 2.69, but brokers noted that
volumes were low.
MANILA eased after Eximbank, of Japan, suspended loans worth Dollars 400m
for power projects pending a court ruling on a petition for an electricity
rate increase. The composite index fell 24.98 to 1,494.39 in 408m pesos
combined turnover.
BOMBAY retreated sharply for the second consecutive trading session as the
market reacted to disappointments over the national budget announced on
Saturday. The BSE index closed at 2,571.18, down 81.22 or 3.1 per cent, as
brokers said that the biggest disappointment in the budget was that the
government did not cut corporate taxes.

FT  02 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets: US gains offset by Japan's losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street was determined last week to retrieve what it had lost in
reaction to Mr Clinton's tax plans the week before, and even the bombing of
the World Trade Centre on Friday could not prevent US equities posting a 2.2
per cent gain.
The Nomura Research Institute Europe is not impressed. It stands by a
massively under-weight recommendation for the US market, says it is more
than fully priced for 'good news' and that failure to break into new high
ground after the drop in US long bond yields 'provides the clearest sell
signal yet seen'.
Japan's 0.6 per cent decline was the main reason why the FT-Actuaries World
Index was limited to a 1.0 per cent rise in local currency terms. Some
observers are waiting for a slump in Tokyo when the fiscal year ends,
investment books close and balance sheet ratios are set for the banks at the
end of this month.
NRI Europe takes the contrary view. It says the deflationary impact of the
rally in the yen will push the authorities towards further moves, 'this time
massive', to reflate. A full one percentage point cut in the discount rate,
and a Y20,000bn (Dollars 170bn) fiscal package would clearly not hurt the
equity market, say the researchers: 'On the contrary, we suspect that the
market is (finally) going to deliver the coup de grace to the bears by
staging a sharp rally up through 20,000.'
The week's worst performer was Mexico, extending a period of relative
weakness this year. Market professionals blame worries over prospects for
the North American Free Trade Agreement and interest rates, the latter
reflect-ing a national trade deficit which has increased five-fold since
1990.
In Europe, opinion gained strength towards the end of the week that a
reduction in key German interest rates was again imminent. France, which
advanced 2.2 per cent last week, is especially interest rate-sensitive.

FT  02 MAR 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): A question of timing for
interest rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOPES of a further interest rate cut from the Bundesbank this week were
behind yesterday's European gains, writes Our Markets Staff. However, Mr
Richard Davidson, European equity strategist at Morgan Stanley in London,
described the interest rate prospect as a 'red herring'.
The Bundesbank might well cut rates this week, he said, but the cut would
have to be one of 100 basis points to underpin, for example, the French
franc. Morgan Stanley is overweight in Europe, likes it a lot on the triple
prospect of a stronger dollar, lower interest rates and, it hopes, resumed
growth in 1994. But its time horizon is over twelve months, not four days.
FRANKFURT saw a four-year low in bond yields and the DAX index, 16.60 higher
at 1,700.95, at its highest level since last July 17. Turnover eased from
DM7.9bn to DM7.5bn.
The Bundesbank's average bond yield fell another 7 basis points to 6.44 per
cent but, as with equities, investors were beginning to see the market as a
little overbought by the afternoon, when German inflation figures came in a
little worse than expected.
In equities, banks moved up strongly on the interest rate speculation, the
critically acclaimed Commerzbank and Dresdner putting on DM6.50 to DM289.50,
DM8.30 to DM404.80 respectively.
Carmakers and their component suppliers were more mixed, above average gains
for Daimler and BMW being offset by a DM4.10 fall to DM274 for Volkswagen
after a German weekly reported that VW could incur a first quarter operating
loss of more than DM1bn.
PARIS broke the 2,000 barrier during the day on futures-led activity and
strong foreign demand, especially from the US. However, some late
profit-taking saw the CAC-40 index lose a little of its strength, closing
15.09 higher at 1,998.80 in turnover of some FFr3.7bn.
Construction and finance stocks were encouraged by the prospect of lower
European interest rates with Bouygues gaining FFr20 to FFr658, SocGen FFr5
to FFr650, Suez FFr6.40 to FFr302.90, also ahead of tomorrow's results, and
Axa FFr22 to FFr1,200.
With further warnings about a decline in European car sales Peugeot lost
FFr1 to FFr638 and Michelin eased FFr4.90 to FFr186.20.
MILAN returned to insurers, which had closed strongly last week, on
expectations that a cabinet meeting later in the day would approve plans for
the introduction of private pension funds. Some observers believe that if
the funds are created, possibly by the third quarter, the fresh inflow of
funds into the equity market could amount to as much as L4,000bn. The Comit
index closed up 17.98 at 531.19.
Generali led the way with a rise of L2,190 to L37,000 while Alleanza moved
ahead L550 to L16,662.
Elsewhere, Fiat maintained its impetus with a gain of L160 to L6,000, and
L6,060 on the kerb. Foreign interest in telecommunications was also seen
with Stet fixing L146 higher at L2,399 and L2,405 after hours and Sip up L54
at L1,778.
ZURICH, too, featured financials on interest rate speculation, with insurers
in the lead. The SMI index closed 21.1 higher at 2,120.5 with Winterthur
bearers SFr70 better at SFr3,360 and Swiss Re certificates SFr14 higher at
SFr604.
AMSTERDAM was flat, the CBS Tendency index closing at 99.9; but among the
actives Unilever built on last week's solid gains following the release of a
positive earnings statement, adding another Fl 3.20 to Fl 211.70.
Heineken, which issues 1992 results on Thursday, was another gainer, up to a
record high during the session of Fl 188.50 before slipping back to finish
up Fl 1.90 at Fl 187.60.
MADRID extended Friday's gains, banks leading with gains of 2 to 3 per cent
in several, and the general index putting on another 3.77 to 236.66 in brisk
turnover of Pta17.35bn, down from Pta5bn previously. The run of corporate
results continued, with no shocks as yet to brake the market.
STOCKHOLM lost some its early gains on late profit-taking but the
Affarsvarlden general index still managed a gain of 18.00 points to close at
1,018.10. Turnover was high at SKr873m after Friday's SKr807m.
Astra continued to recover some of last week's losses with a SKr7 rise in
the B shares to SKr692. In the banking sector, Handeslbanken advanced
another SKr3 to SKr72.
VIENNA finished at its highest close since last July with a rise in the ATX
index of 20.21, or 2.4 per cent to 857.33.
The construction sector led the day's rally with Universale up Sch59, or 6.6
per cent at Sch949.
COPENHAGEN was pushed lower by reports that Carlsberg might be overvalued,
and by losses at Unidanmark. The brewer's B shares fell DKr12.55 to DKr266
while Denmark's second largest bank group rallied to close unchanged at
DKr135 after DKr132. The KFX index closed 0.69 lower at 81.48.
ISTANBUL fell 4.6 per cent as overnight and short term bond rates reflected
the banks' need to meet some TL16,000bn in treasury bill auction payments on
Wednesday. The market index was 273.52 lower at a provisional 5,650.09,
taking its losses to 7.25 per cent since last Wednesday's record high.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Pound rallies against D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING enjoyed a strong rally against the D-Mark yesterday, buoyed by the
clear hope in both foreign exchange and money markets that the Bundesbank
would cut its official discount rate at its council meeting on Thursday,
writes James Blitz.
The UK currency advanced 3 1/2 pfennigs on the day, closing at DM2.3700. It
also enjoyed a strong rise against the exchange rate index, which measures
the pound's value against a basket of currencies. Sterling ended 110 basis
points higher at 77.1.
The pound's strength was partly due to several factors specific to the UK.
Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, suggested at the weekend that there
would be no further cuts in UK rates for some time to come. Yesterday's data
for UK money supply showed that M0 rose 0.7 per cent in February for a 4.8
per cent gain year-on-year, suggesting a rise in consumer spending.
But the main factor behind yesterday's improvement in sterling was the
indication at the G7 finance ministers' meeting in London at the weekend
that the Bundesbank was prepared to see further falls in money market rates.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, indicated a more relaxed
attitude to falling interest rates. He said the changes in the minimum
reserve requirements for German commercial banks should prompt a slight fall
in money market interest rates.
Mr Schlesinger's comments helped to unwind tensions in the European exchange
rate mechanism yesterday. The French franc firmed to a close of FFr3.394
against the German currency, from a previous FFr3.400.
However, there was concern last night that the market was too optimistic
about the possibility of the officially posted rates being reduced.
Market participants expecting an easing in the repo rate, at which the
Bundesbank provides wholesale funds to commercial banks, may be justified.
But Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the
main requirements of an easing in the discount rate were not in place. The
German government's Solidarity Pact has not been agreed, wage agreements in
the manufacturing sector have not been completed and yesterday's consumer
prices figure, at a 4.2 per cent year-on-year rise, was not encouraging.
Yesterday's lacklustre performance by the dollar, which gained  1/2 pfennig
against the D-Mark to finish at DM1.6465, may push the Bundesbank in the
direction of cutting the discount rate. In New York the US unit advanced to
DM1.6547.
One dealer said there was now less risk that an easing of policy would raise
the prospect of imported inflation by depressing the German currency. But Mr
Neil MacKinnon of Citibank in London remained sceptical. 'The market may be
pricing in too much from the Bundesbank this Thursday,' he said.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Money Markets: Germany hints again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundesbank gave another subtle hint yesterday that German money market
rates should come down this week after it issued rather less volume in its
first tender for short-term liquidity paper than dealers had expected,
writes James Blitz.
At the weekend, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, revealed a
slight change of mood over interest rate policy, suggesting that cash rates
could come down as the Bundesbank's new rules on commercial banks' minimum
reserve requirements take effect.
Yesterday was the first day that the new rules came into operation, and
there was indeed a sharp drop in the value of call money. It fell from
around the Lombard rate level of 9 per cent at the start of the day to 8.78
per cent by the close of trading, as more funds came into the market.
However, details of the issue of 3, 6, and 9-month bills may also have
implied that rates could soften this week.
Miss Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets in London noted that the
Bundesbank had said earlier this month that it would allot up to DM25bn in
the first of these new allocations of short-dated instruments to the German
money market.
Yesterday, the Bundesbank announced it would be allotting DM14.8bn of
short-term funds. In Miss Cottrell's view, the central bank was therefore
adding liquidity to the market. She believes the Bundesbank's repo rate
should therefore come down 15 basis points to about 8.35 per cent later this
week.
Dealers in Euromark futures contracts continued to assume that there would
also be another cut in the Bundesbank's officially posted discount rate at
this week's council meeting.
The March Euromark contract was little changed on the day, closing 3 basis
points down at 92.05. At this level it assumes that three-month money in two
weeks' time will be at 7.95 per cent, implying a reduction in the discount
rate 'floor', currently at 8.00 per cent.
Reflecting the news from Germany, the March French franc contract rose 8
basis points on the day to finish at 88.55.
Sterling futures also gained ground: the March short sterling contract
closed 2 basis points firmer at 94.06. Three-month sterling cash ended 1/8
percentage point softer at 6 per cent. This reflected the termination of
'end-of-month' factors, which always bring tighter conditions in wholesale
cash markets.

London robusta COFFEE and COCOA limped to a close little changed from
opening levels and lamenting the delayed opening of their New York
counterparts following the bomb at the World Trade Centre. 'It's been a
waste of time this afternoon. Everyone's been sitting around, twiddling
their thumbs,' one London cocoa dealer said. The weakness of the French
franc against sterling was keeping origins sidelined and adding some light
support. Otherwise, dealers were keeping one eye on pact talks in Geneva,
where consumers and producers failed to agree last week on a compromise
proposal. After separate group meetings, delegates said there were signs the
gap between the two sides was beginning to narrow, but many traders were
still cynical. Coffee traders were expecting little market-moving news from
a two-day producer meeting in Mexico City in preparation for the next set of
pact talks later this month. In New York arabica prices were sharply down
after a delayed opening.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Base metals prices still in
retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BASE METAL prices were in retreat on the London Metal Exchange yesterday,
continuing on the downward path started last week.
Three-month copper led the way, breaking below Dollars 2,150 a tonne to
close at a 3 1/2 -month low. Zinc and aluminium followed suit, falling to
15-month and three-month lows respectively, while nickel retreated back
below Dollars 6,000 a tonne.
Mr Angus MacMillan, analyst with Billiton-Enthoven, part of the Royal
Dutch/Shell group, said Chinese buying had kept three-month copper above
Dollars 2,400 a tonne in January, while last month floods in Arizona and
strikes in Mexico and at Papua New Guinea's huge Ok Tedi mine had kept the
pot boiling above Dollars 2,200.
But any supporting factors had now evaporated, leaving the market with a
pessimistic demand outlook for the next 16 months.
GNI, the London futures broker, said copper appeared to be on the brink of a
major price collapse. Prospects for a pick-up in the US economy had been
offset by news that European car production could fall by 1.5m units this
year, and that Japanese car production was 16.5 per cent down in January.
Weak fundamentals, sluggish physical demand, rising stocks and negative
chart formations paint a bleak picture for base metal prices, analysts
suggest. While some production cuts have been announced for zinc and nickel,
they have been too little too late. Cuts in copper production are unlikely
as most producers are still making profits.

MR VALERY Rudakov, president of the Russian diamond producing company Almazy
Rossii-Sakha, said yesterday he would soon set up an exchange in Moscow to
sell rough diamonds to the country's diamond-cutting factories.
He said this would reorganise on market principles the system whereby only
the Committee for Precious Stones and Metals could sell rough stones to
cutters and industrial diamond users. In future, both the exchange, which
would start up in a month or two, and the committee would be allowed to sell
rough stones, he said.
One western expert said, however, that this only underlined the continuing
rivalry between Mr Rudakov and Mr Yevgeny Bychkov, the head of the Committee
for Precious Stones and Metals. The two men locked horns two years ago when
they were respectively head of the old Soviet Glavalmazzoloto diamond and
gold monopoly and the state depository Gokhran.
'Almazy Rossii-Sakha is supposed to have a monopoly to sell Russian rough to
De Beers and factories. If the committee goes on selling, it will be an
unusual situation,' said the western diamond expert. 'One side will have to
win out in the end. While Rudakov is more savvy, Bychkov has good
connections (in Russia).'
Under an agreement with De Beers that expires in 1995, Russia can sell only
5 per cent of its rough diamonds on international markets, though De Beers
claims that additional quantities are smuggled out.
The committee wants to be in charge of selling this 5 per cent (designed to
help Russia monitor the prices fetched by De Beers), while Mr Rudakov
suggested that his exchange should carry out this function.
The western expert said that if given a monopoly on sales, the exchange
could prevent Russian diamond-cutters from undermining western markets. This
is because they would have to bid for stones and De Beers could compete as
well, driving up the price of rough stones, and preventing cheap Russian
cut-diamonds from indirectly depressing the rough-stone market.
Mr Rudakov said an additional exchange would be set up in Yakutsk, the
capital of the autonomous republic which produces 98 per cent of Russia's
diamonds, to sell diamonds to its fledgling diamond-cutting industry.
So as to make more of its diamond wealth, Russia is trying to improve its
inefficient diamond-cutting industry by bringing in foreign partners. For
the moment, however, prospective foreign partners have to choose between
whether to team up with Mr Rudakov or Mr Bychkov.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture: Aluminium smelters in 'poverty
trap'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSS-MAKING ALUMINIUM smelters in the West are caught in a poverty trap that
prevents them from cutting production in spite of low prices and record
stocks, according to a report from the Commodities Research Unit.
The report estimates that more than half Western capacity is losing money on
every tonne of production, while the flood of metal from the former Soviet
Union shows no sign of abating.
However, while Western production needs to be curbed to bolster prices,
companies are entirely rational not to close even their higher cost and
economically vulnerable smelters, the CRU asserts. 'Temporary or partial
closures are not an attractive option because of the high proportion of
fixed or unavoidable costs within total operating costs.'
Permanent closure is also unattractive because in the current state of the
market the liquidation value of a plant is small. In addition, any single
closure would have little effect on the market, and the CRU believes it
unlikely that producers will act collectively on a programme of closures.
The CRU is forecasting only a slow improvement in the market balance as the
surplus production is eroded by a gradual increase in demand. It predicts
that investment in new capacity will be delayed to the extent that prices
will move sharply higher towards the turn of the century when the surplus is
finally worked off.
Meanwhile, companies will be better off uprating and upgrading existing
plant than investing in greenfield sites, the CRU suggests.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Farmer's Viewpoint): Touring
Europe's green and set-aside land - A journey from Norfolk to Austria
reveals the early evidence of farm policy reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE DESTINATION
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
a heavily timbered hotel in a village surrounded by snow-covered slopes in
the Arlberg region of Austria. The starting point - a somewhat less pretty
but well-loved village in the middle of Norfolk, England. The journey - by
road and sea-ferry with a few friends as anxious as I for a temporary change
of scenery and the feel of some snow under their skis.
As we left home, much of the autumn-sown corn had begun to recover from
indifferent planting conditions and the wettest early winter for years. But,
ironically, the forecast was for snow and bitterly-cold weather, which we
knew would put back that recovery as well as delaying spring-cereal
planting. We would far rather go to find snow elsewhere and have it stay
away from our farms in late February and early March.
On the journey to the ferry, the 15 per cent of East Anglian fields left
unploughed so that weeds and other green material could regenerate naturally
and qualify the land for voluntary set-aside - the most visible result of
the 1992 reform of the European Community's common agricultural policy - was
beginning to show itself.
And although the devaluation of the pound last autumn will result in
increased compensation payments for UK farmers when they set land aside,
none of us in the vehicle thought the extra cash made the exercise
attractive.
An uneventful crossing from Felixstowe to Zebrugge was notable only for the
fact that many of our fellow passengers were only making day trips to fill
up their cars and vans with duty-free booze and cigarettes.
Then towards Brussels - the home of Eurocrats and the centre of agricultural
decision-making. We did not go into the centre to throw eggs at the EC's
Berlaymont building in the Rue de la Loi as some French farmers might have
done. But we did say a few rude things about the lack of practicality and
grass-roots agricultural knowledge of many of those who worked there as we
took the many-bridged by-pass autoroute around the town.
Some might say, however, that we were cursing the wrong people. For about 50
km (30 miles) south-east of Brussels, just off the main road, is the Belgian
University of Gembloux. Back in the early and mid-1970s, the professor of
agriculture there, a man called Laloux, developed what he called
'blueprints' for the production of cereals, the purpose of these strict
planting, fertilising and spraying programmes being to maximise yields.
Little calculation as to whether or not the exercise was profitable was
necessary. Yield was everything and the community's guaranteed-price system
ensured that profitability followed yields upwards.
Other experts in other areas of the EC followed the Laloux example and
developed similar blueprints for their local conditions. And we farmers
adopted them with enthusiasm; they meant, after all, that we made bigger
profits. But they also led to increases in production, to unsustainable
surpluses and eventually to the reform of the CAP.
Nobody uses the blueprints today - we cannot afford to. The emphasis is on
minimising inputs and optimising yields rather than maximising production. A
series of EC price cuts, which will deepen as CAP reform continues, has seen
to that. And, to be fair, the result is a more sensible use of resources as
well as being more environment friendly. But the Laloux blueprints of the
1970s were a necessary step to the fuller understanding of the physiology of
cereals which, in turn, is helping us to survive the stringent economies of
the 1990s.
Moving south, through the Lorraine, across the Maginot Line, into the
Moselle and Alsace and towards Strasbourg, home of the European Parliament,
I found the road is much improved since I last travelled it, presumably to
make it easier for the hordes of EC officials who are forced to make the
journey each time the Parliament meets.
The crops of autumn-sown grain were looking even sadder than those we had
left at home. A few farmers were out with their fertiliser-spreaders trying
to apply nitrogen to encourage them to grow. Here, too, the set-aside land
is beginning to be obvious, although there is less of it than in East Anglia
because of small-farm exemptions.
We passed through little Luxembourg on the way; not a particularly
significant agricultural member of the community but the one that has
provided the new Agriculture Commissioner, Mr Rene Steichen, in succession
to Ireland's Mr Ray MacSharry, author of CAP reform, who has retired to
Ireland.
Onwards, across the Rhine and to the forests and small farms of southern
Germany. Most of the land was already covered with a light dusting of snow,
so it was not so easy to make roadside judgments. Even so, the occasional
farm cart, hauled by horses, reminded us of the wide range of living
standards that still exist within our so-called Common Market. I remembered
a speech I had heard in Berlin from out-going German farm minister and
Bavarian farmer, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, only a few weeks ago at the opening of
the Green Week, the annual agricultural jamboree. He had followed on to the
platform Mr Jean-Pierre Soisson, the French Farm minister, who had declared
unequivocally that there was no way France would accept the agricultural
restrictions the US deal on the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade would impose. Mr Kiechle, in an attempt, no doubt, to
cement Franco-German unity on such matters, never mind that it had already
been accepted by other members, agreed that the agricultural aspects of the
agreement would have to be re-negotiated.
As we crossed the border into Austria and out of the European Community, I
could not help reflecting on the enormous and seemingly-insuperable
differences that existed between the members of the so-called European
family. And yet, in 1989, Austria applied for membership of that family, we
are told with the agreement of a majority of its citizens, including most of
its farmers.
Why? I know from previous visits that Austrian farmers receive 50 per cent
more for their wheat than I do in the UK; those with dairy farms get twice
as much for their milk; and instead of the detested set-aside, the Austrian
government has decided to subsidise its farmers to produce non-food crops,
such as oilseed rape, to refine into diesel fuel.
There is an apparent acceptance by Austrians that they have a duty to ensure
that the 6.3 per cent of farmers in their population are as well off as the
rest of the community. Oh, for a touch of that attitude in the UK]
Furthermore, partly because of a strong Austrian schilling and a weak pound,
I have just paid a man who used to be just a farmer but is now the
proprietor of a sports shop as well, the equivalent value of one tonne of UK
wheat for a six-day ski-lift ticket and another man the world price of a
tonne of wheat to hire a set of skis and sticks for the same period.
The village where I am staying is packed with people from all over Europe
who are queueing up to do the same thing. Austria earns more per head from
tourism than any European country, in or out of the EC, and a fair
proportion of the benefit of that goes directly or indirectly to
agriculture.
I can only ask again - why on earth do Austrians, and Austrian farmers in
particular, want to risk losing their independence by joining the European
Community?

contract
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PETROTECH International Corporation has won the new contract to operate the
Petromar oil field off the northern Peruvian coast. The concession, formerly
held by Belco, was taken over by the state after a 1985 contractual dispute.
Settlement of an insurance claim by American International Group is still
outstanding.
Petrotech, registered in Delaware, is part of the New York McAllister
Brothers group. Its current operations focus on Venezuela and the Gulf of
Mexico. Through a subsidiary, International Marine, it has maintained a
presence in Peru for ten years, servicing the Petromar offshore field.
Two other international companies - Hallwood Petroleum of the US and
Compania Naviera Perez Companc of Argentina - pre-qualified to bid.
Petrotech will take an average of almost 79 per cent of all crude produced,
leaving 21 per cent for Petroperu, the state-run petroleum giant.
The concession for the 400-hectare lot Z-2B will run for ten years with an
option to renew for a further ten. Output from the field has slumped since
the Belco days, from a peak of 30,000 barrels a day to an all-time low last
year of less than half that. In recent months, despite a dearth of equipment
and spare parts, output has risen to 17,000 b/d.
The concession is an important step in the planned privatisation of
Petroperu. According to Mr Jaime Quijandria, the company's president, 'the
most attractive part of the field lies in the 50 per cent still unexplored.
And while that exploration goes ahead, the new operating company will be
earning cash from the half that's already working'.
Contract terms require Petrotech to drill at least 40 development wells over
the next three years and five exploration wells by the year 2000. Petrotech
officials estimated drilling costs at Dollars 80m and Dollars 20m
respectively. The operator will also pay Petroperu Dollars 10m a year for
the lease of existing assets. Another Dollars 30m to Dollars 60m will have
to be spent on repairs and modernisation.
Meanwhile, other advances were made in the transformation Petroperu. Three
weeks ago, New York-based Booz, Allen and Hamilton was contracted to advise
the Peruvian government on an overall privatisation strategy for the oil
sector. And ten days ago Great Western Resources, through its Peruvian
affiliate, signed an exploration agreement with Petroperu for Block 65 in
the Maranon basin. It is the company's first ever venture outside the US.
The Belco insurance claim remains unresolved. While AIG tacitly agreed to
the re-leasing of the ex-Belco field, sources said that the dispute,
involving Dollars 185m in compensation and already recognised by the
Fujimori government, had by no means been dropped.

Canadian gold mine

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL OAK Mines, the Vancouver-based gold producer that specialises in
restoring high-cost mines to profitability, has signed an agreement to buy
the mothballed Colomac property in Canada's Northwest Territories.
The seller is Neptune Resources, which will receive 3.5m Royal Oak shares,
worth CDollars 10.2m (Pounds 5.7m), as well as a royalty over five years,
payable if the gold price achieves an annual average of more than Dollars
400 a troy ounce. The deal is expected to be finalised on March 25.
Neptune closed Colomac in mid-1991 after the mine had been in operation for
only a year. At the time, it estimated that a gold price of about Dollars
425 an ounce was required to keep the operation profitable.
Royal Oak said that it hoped to cut cash production costs to less than
Dollars 300 an ounce, partly by running Colomac in tandem with its Giant
mine in Yellowknife.
Unionised workers at the Giant mine have staged a bitter and often violent
strike for the past nine months, but Royal Oak has kept it operating with
outside workers. The company is insisting, among other things, that wages be
linked to the gold price.
Royal Oak plans a feasibility study at Colomac this summer with a view to
reopening the mine in 1994.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Government Bonds: Gilts strengthened by a sharp recovery in
sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN government bonds rose sharply yesterday on hopes of a cut in official
interest rates by the Bundesbank on Thursday, dragging other European bond
markets in their wake. UK government bonds were further helped by a sharp
recovery in sterling, prompting longer-dated gilt price to rise by a point.
The yield on 10-year bunds fell to 6.66 per cent as prices jumped by half a
point. The yield had broken below 6.75 per cent only last Friday, having
stood at 7 per cent two weeks ago.
Comments made after the weekend meeting in London of G7 finance ministers
were the cause of the continuing enthusiasm for German bonds, analysts said.
The beneficial effects of the German wage round, completed at the end of
last week, had already been reflected in market prices.
However, several observers warned that the rally had been so strong in
recent days that little short of a 50 basis point cut in official German
interest rates this week, and a significant reduction in the Repurchase
agreement rate, would meet the market's hopes.
'It's difficult to see what the Bundesbank can do to satisfy these
expectations,' said Ms Alison Cottrell, of Midland Global Markets.
LONG-DATED gilts jumped by a point as sterling bounced from its recent lows,
prompting speculation that foreign investors would soon start to return to
the market.
There was further encouragement from official figures which showed that
banks and building societies in the UK increased their holdings of gilts by
Pounds 2.9bn during January, to Pounds 11.4bn, as the steepening sterling
yield curve made longer-dated bonds more attractive.
This was likely to encourage the UK government to amend its funding rules to
allow such purchases to count towards funding of the government's borrowing
requirement, analysts said.
The strong rise in gilts prompted the Bank of England to issue four further
tranches of tap stock, weighted towards the longer end of the yield curve:
Pounds 400m of 7 1/4 per cent stock due 1998, Pounds 250m of 9 3/4 per cent
stock due 2002, Pounds 250m of 8 3/4 per cent bonds due 2017 and Pounds 100m
of 2 1/2 per cent index-linked gilts due 2013.
With market observers generally revising down their forecasts of the current
year's borrowing requirement in the wake of good figures for January, such
sales are likely to eat further into next year's PSBR.
OTHER European bond markets jumped on the hopes of a German rate cut and an
easing of tensions within the European exchange rate mechanism.
French government bonds rose almost as sharply, though the yield spread
between French and German bonds widened out slightly to around 90 basis
points.
With elections later this month, the political risk presented by French
bonds was likely to keep the yield spread against Germany at least at
current levels, analysts warned.
An auction of French OATs later this week would also limit the gains on
10-year bonds, said Mr Philip Tyson, an economist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
US TREASURY prices moved broadly higher yesterday as the market paid more
attention to the morning's purchasing manager's report than to Friday's
explosion at the World Trade Center.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was  25/32 higher at
103 21/32 , yielding 6.831 per cent.
At the short end of the market, the two-year note was up  3/32 to yield
3.858 per cent.
Volume, however, was light, reflecting the absence of the Cantor Fitzgerald
inter-dealer broker screen, which was knocked out in Friday's bomb blast. In
addition, some dealers reported having trouble settling Friday's trades
Bond market investors were encouraged by a report by the National
Association of Purchasing Management which showed a drop in the business
activity index to 55.8 in February from 58 in January. The decline was
steeper than expected.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Borrowers kept on sideline by interest
rate hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY a handful of Eurobond issues surfaced yesterday, as the international
bond market took a breather after several weeks of heavy new-issue activity.
Expectations that the Bundesbank would cut leading interest rates at its
fortnightly meeting on Thursday kept borrowers on the sidelines, syndicate
managers said.
However, new-issue activity is expected to pick up again quickly, with the
market waiting for the Province of Ontario's first global Canadian dollar
bond issue later this week. The province expects to raise a minimum of
CDollars 1bn through the issue, which is likely to have a maturity of 10
years and a yield spread of around 90 basis points above comparable Canadian
government bonds.
However, a decline in swap spreads in the Canadian dollar market has caused
other potential issuers of Canadian dollar Eurobonds to reconsider their
options, syndicate managers said.
Among yesterday's issues, ABN Amro Bank led a seven-year guilder Eurobond
issue for itself, raising the amount to Fl 1bn from Fl 750m due to good
demand. The bonds, which carry a coupon of 6 5/8 per cent, were priced to
yield 17.5 basis points above the 9 per cent Dutch government bonds due
2000. When the bonds were freed to trade, the spread narrowed slightly.
An official at ABN Amro said the issue had been placed by mid-afternoon,
mainly with institutions and banks in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Belgium,
Luxembourg and Austria. He added that the bonds had been pitched at the
seven-year area of the yield curve where supply was scarce. Recent guilder
issues have been concentrated in the 10-year area.
Elsewhere, the Council of Europe re-opened its 9 per cent Ecu1bn Eurobond
issue due 2001 and raised a further Ecu100m. The original issue was launched
in November 1991. The new tranche was priced at 106.30 to yield 7.96 per
cent. When the bonds were freed to trade, the price rose to 106.40 to yield
7.94 per cent.
An official at the lead manager, Goldman Sachs, said that the Council of
Europe had been looking to re-open the issue for some time and that it had
made sense to lock into current rates in view of the recent strength in the
Ecu market.
Goldman Sachs also arranged a four-year Y30bn Eurobond issue for Mitsui
Fudosan Company, Japan's largest commercial real estate developer.
The bonds, which carry a coupon of 4.3 per cent, were sold around par,
within total fees of 1 5/8 per cent.
They were mainly placed with investors in the Asia Pacific region.
Late in the day, Electricite de France re-opened its FFr3bn zero-coupon
Eurobond issue for the second time, and raised a further FFr1bn. The
original issue of FFr2bn was launched in November 1991 and was increased by
FFr1bn in November 1992.
The new tranche was priced at 49.50 to yield five basis points above the 8
1/2 per cent OATs due 2002.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has raised more than
half of its planned Ecu900m of borrowings for this year, Mr Rene Karsenti,
treasurer, said yesterday. He added that the EBRD was looking closely at
returning to the Ecu bond market, but that it could still achieve a lower
all-in cost by borrowing in other currencies and swapping.
The EBRD's average borrowing costs last year, after swaps, amounted to 40
basis points below Libor, with an average maturity of seven years.

corporate issuers

CORPORATE borrowers could be crowded out of the international and foreign
bond markets by the heavy borrowing requirements of public sector entities,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) warns in
its latest report on financial market trends.
However, even if the financing demands of the public sector remain heavy for
a prolonged period, favourable market conditions may induce large corporate
borrowers to lock in borrowing terms in those markets that are perceived to
be near the bottom of the interest rate cycle.
'Even if this strategy may imply the acceptance of somewhat larger spreads
relative to treasuries, its pursuit may prove profitable in a longer-term
perspective,' the Paris-based OECD says. It adds that all available
indicators support the view that the size of capital demand for 1993 will be
much larger than in recent years.
According to the OECD, offerings by governments in the international and
foreign bond markets rose to Dollars 64bn in 1992 from Dollars 43bn one year
earlier, and accounted for 19 per cent of overall new issues of Dollars
334bn last year. This compared with a share of 14 per cent and 11 per cent
in 1991 and 1990 respectively.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Capital Markets: German money markets lifted
by new paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE development of the German money markets was given an added stimulus
yesterday as the first issue of short-dated government paper, or bulis,
coincided with the first issue of money market instruments from a German
bank.
The Bundesbank sold DM14.8bn of three, six and nine-month paper, soaking up
some of the extra liquidity created as a cut in German minimum reserve
ratios took effect.
The change in minimum reserve policy, announced last month, released DM32bn
to the banking system, which had previously been tied up in interest-free
deposits with the Bundesbank.
The cut in minimum reserves on bank deposits to 2 per cent prompted
Bayerische Vereinsbank to issue short-dated paper. It is the first German
bank to take such a step.
The bank's paper has been timed to mature on the quarterly settlement days
of the Euro-DM futures contract on Liffe, potentially making it a more
useful instrument in interest rate risk management, said Mr Norbert Juchem,
a deputy member of the board of managing directors.
The bulis auctioned yesterday attracted bids of more than DM30bn, helping to
push the yield levels on the paper sold well below current yields on
comparable short-term deposits. The DM4.7bn of three-month paper issued, for
example, was sold at a yield of 7.86 per cent, below the 8.06 per cent
deposit rate.
Some DM5.7bn of six-month bulis were sold at a yield of 7.52 per cent, with
the DM4.4bn of nine-month paper giving a yield of 7.06 per cent.
'The auction went well, with a high level of bids,' said Mr Klaus Baader of
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in London. He expressed surprise, though, that the
three-month paper was yielding so much less than the three-month deposit
rate.
Bayerische said its paper was trading late yesterday at a yield  1/8 point
below the London Interbank Bid Rate (Libid), in line with price levels for
commercial paper issued by such names as Daimler-Benz and the Bundespost.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Teva 36% ahead on back of US
sales surge

<TEXT>
TEVA, Israel's leading pharmaceutical manufacturer, reported net profits up
36 per cent to Shk87.7m (Dollars 31.7m) in 1992, due mainly to a surge in US
sales which carried overseas turnover ahead of domestic for the first time.
Sales in the US, where Teva has been targeting growth for several years,
rose by more than 30 per cent to account for some 35 per cent of total group
sales of Shk1.09bn, which in turn were up by 23 per cent. Total overseas
sales reached Shk560m, reflecting Teva's strategy of growing beyond the
limited local market and establishing itself as one of Israel's leading
technology-based exporters.
The company said Teva's concentration on generic and prescription drugs
through its own manufacturing and through Lemmon, its US subsidiary, had
enabled it to sustain strong overseas growth despite the generally weak
economic background throughout much of the year.
Teva, which is listed on Nasdaq in the US, has put much of its effort abroad
into the more homogenous US market. But it said it was now seeking to expand
in Europe, which at present accounts for 10 per cent of sales. It has
acquired companies in Italy and Germany, and says it is looking for further
acquisitions to extend its penetration in Europe.
The inflation-adjusted results showed earnings per ordinary share at
Shk3.34, up from Shk2.74 in 1991.
Green Cross, a Japanese pharmaceutical and blood-products concern, posted a
59 per cent fall in consolidated net profits to Y1.24bn (Dollars 10.5m) from
Y2.97bn for the year to December, AP-DJ reports from Tokyo.
Sales rose 4.9 per cent to Y106.6bn from Y101.58bn, while pre-tax profits
fell 15 per cent to Y5.3bn from Y6.2bn. Earnings per share fell 58 per cent
to Y5.99 from Y14.35.

<TEXT>
SAFREN, the South African shipping, leisure and freight handling group,
recorded an 18 per cent drop in attributable earnings for the six months to
the end of December as deteriorating trading conditions affected all its
divisions.
Turnover rose marginally to R2.37bn (Dollars 764m) from R2.31bn during the
same period in 1991, but operating profit was 1 per cent lower at R334.6m
compared with R337.8m. A sharp rise, however, in net interest paid - to
R24.2m from R1m - and a decline in the share of associated companies'
profits, which fell to R36.7m from R63.4m, caused attributable earnings to
fall to R109.4m from R133.3m.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 65 cents per share despite
earnings per share falling by 18.6 per cent to 202 cents from 248 cents.
Increased competition and the recession, both in South Africa and abroad,
caused Safmarine, the shipping and transport subsidiary, to experience
declining cargo volumes and reduced freight rates in its liner and bulk
trades.
Increased depreciation and interest arising from large investments in new
ships and containers also affected profit adversely. Safair, the freight
carrier, suffered from the resurgence of hostilities in Angola, while
Flitestar, the domestic airline, incurred substantial losses owing to
overcapacity and predatory pricing on domestic routes.
Profits at Kersaf, the leisure and entertainment arm, were lower due to
difficult trading conditions, aggravated by construction work at its main
resorts and competition from unregulated casinos. Rennies, the freight
handling group, benefited from its participation in a drought relief scheme
in the region and lifted profits.
Safmarine, Rennies and Kersaf respectively contributed 22 per cent, 21 per
cent and 56 per cent to Safren's attributable profit.

<TEXT>
NORTH Broken Hill Peko (North), the Australian resources group, has reported
a 24 per cent increase in net profit to ADollars 52.3m (USDollars 36m) for
the six months to the end of December.
However, the group said pre-tax profit fell by ADollars 25m to ADollars
113m, partly because of the cost of restructuring in the forestry and paper
production divisions.
The improvement in net profit reflected a gain of ADollars 16.8m from the
sale of shares and a reduction of ADollars 11.4m in net interest costs,
which fell to ADollars 23.4m as a result of debt reduction and lower
interest rates.
The board said second-half net profit should equal the first-half result,
but warned that earnings would be affected by lower iron ore prices and
difficult trading conditions facing the forestry and paper businesses.
At the operating level, the group said three of its four divisions suffered
falls in pre-tax earnings. Warman International, the mining pump
manufacturer, increased profit by 70 per cent to ADollars 14m. Sales fell 7
per cent to ADollars 751m.

NEW Zealand Refining Company, which operates the Marsden Point Oil Refinery,
has reported a 7 per cent rise in profits to NZDollars 53.02m (USDollars
27.77m) in the year to December 31.
New Zealand Refining is controlled by a consortium of Shell, BP, Mobil and
Caltex, with 20 per cent held by the New Zealand public. The company is
recommending a final dividend of 75 cents a share, making a full-year
payment of NZDollars 1.25, up from 70 cents in 1991.
Total operating revenues rose to NZDollars 280.35m from NZDollars 275.2m,
while operating profits advanced to NZDollars 79.76m from NZDollars 74.34m.
Tax took NZDollars 26.73m compared with NZDollars 24.81m.
Fernz Corp, one of the biggest listed fertiliser companies in Australia and
New Zealand, yesterday announced expansion into Malaysia, taking a
controlling interest in Ancom, a Malaysian agricultural chemist, for
NZDollars 12m.
Ancom Berhad is listed on the Malaysian Stock Exchange. Fernz is involved in
industrial chemicals, timber treatment processing, and fertiliser making.
Fernz announced its first links with Ancom Berhad in 1991. The purchase of
the Malaysian interests is through Fernz subsidiary Nufarm Energy. The
agreement needs Malaysian government approval.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Robotics chief warns of tough
12-months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S Dollars 500m robotics market is facing a tough year in 1993 because
of the recession in Germany and reduced investment by the automotive sector,
said Mr Bruce Potts, executive vice-president of Fanuc Robotics Europe.
But the market was likely to bounce back next year because of strong
underlying demand for robots by European manufacturers keen to improve their
productivity, he said.
Mr Potts was speaking in Coventry at the unveiling by Fanuc Robotics, the
world's largest robot producer, of its new series of robot control systems.
The controller is a key plank in Fanuc's strategy to broaden the use of
robots in non-automotive markets; in Europe, for example, about 60 per cent
of the installed base of 50,000 to 60,000 robots is used by the motor
industry.
It is also an important element in Fanuc's strategy to become the market
leader in Europe, where, said Mr Potts, it runs a 'solid second' behind ABB
Robotics.
In the past two years, the European robotics market has been relatively more
resilient than other sectors of mechanical engineering.
Last year, the market was flat, with weakness in some countries offset by
the effects of reunification in Germany, which accounts for about half the
total market, and by carmakers' spending.
This year, said Mr Potts, the North American robot market will come out of
recession and will be the best-performing of the major markets. The European
market could fall from last year, but would still perform better than the
recession-bound Japanese market.
Fanuc believes the new controller will have the same effect on the robot
market as the 'graphical user interface' had on personal computers by making
the robot easier to understand for users in areas such as welding,
mechanical handling and painting.

<TEXT>
COMALCO, the Australian aluminium manufacturer, yesterday reported net
profits of ADollars 42.5m (USDollars 29.54m) after abnormal items for the
year to December, compared with losses of ADollars 72.2m in the previous
year.
However, net profits before abnormal items increased by a more modest
ADollars 18m to ADollars 39.6m, largely as a result of a lower tax bill. The
group warned that it expected 'difficult' conditions to continue in the
current year.
Comalco said the bottom-line result included an abnormal profit of ADollars
2.9m following a detailed review of asset values. The 1991 result included
an abnormal loss of ADollars 93.7m caused by a ADollars 200m provision
against asset values offset by a transfer of ADollars 106.3m from the group
superannuation fund.
Mr Nick Stump, chief executive, said sales volumes had been reduced by
difficult trading conditions. However, the impact was offset by a more
competitive exchange rate, which helped sales increase to ADollars 2.1bn
from ADollars 2bn.
Comalco said an improved result from Commonwealth Aluminium, a US
subsidiary, was largely offset by lower aluminium and alumina prices.
Aluminium prices averaged Dollars US1,279 a tonne, compared with USDollars
1,333 in 1991. The group said prices had averaged Dollars US1,227 this year.
'No major improvements in price and demand are likely to occur before 1994,
but the longer-term outlook is sound as demand grows in the Asian economies
and there is increased use of aluminium worldwide by the packaging and
automobile industries,' Comalco said.
The directors raised the final dividend to 3 cents, fully franked, from 2
cents in 1991, making a total dividend of 5 cents, compared with 4 cents.
Comalco is 67 per cent owned by CRA, the Australian resources group, which
is 49 per cent owned by RTZ of the UK.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: NEC predicts pre-tax loss of
Y40bn as demand slows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics group, revised downwards its results forecast
for the year to March and expects to see a Y40bn (Dollars 344m) pre-tax loss
for the group on a consolidated basis.
The revision comes after NEC announced in October a pre-tax profits forecast
of Y10bn. It reflects an unexpectedly depressed market for electronic
products worldwide in the first three months of this year, the company said.
NEC now forecasts consolidated sales of Y3,620bn, compared with a previous
forecast of Y3,780bn. A pre-tax loss of Y40bn compares with a profit of
Y51.4bn in the year to March 1992. For the parent company, NEC expects a 5
per cent drop in sales to Y2,900bn and a pre-tax profit of Y18bn, which
represents a 77 per cent decline from the previous Y40bn.
The company blamed the unexpectedly severe slowdown in domestic demand,
particularly for electronic devices, for the revision of its results
forecast. When NEC made its profits forecast in October, it had been
expecting a customary seasonal rush of orders in the January to March period
from corporations buying to use up their procurement budget. This year,
however, that buying spree failed to materialise.
NEC has, like many Japanese semiconductor companies, been hurt by a severely
depressed market for memory chips and by weak prices, which lasted until the
fourth quarter of last year. In 1992, NEC lost its position as the world's
largest semiconductor manufacturer to Intel of the US, according to
Dataquest the market research group.
In its computer business, the company faces growing competition from US
manufacturers in its home market where it has a 53 per cent market share.
For the fiscal year beginning in April, however, NEC expects overall
revenues to increase by 4 to 5 per cent as the Japanese government's
economic stimulus package and the recovery in the US market help to lift
trading activity.

Brewing earnings at midway

SA BREWING, the Australian food and industrial group, yesterday reported a
1.1 per cent increase in interim net profit to ADollars 57.15m (USDollars
39.72m) for the six months to the end of December.
The group said strong appliance sales, higher wine exports and lower
interest costs offset poor results from beer and packaging operations. Sales
increased by 7.3 per cent to ADollars 1.12bn.
Mr Ross Wilson, managing director, said the outlook for the second half
'looks reasonably favourable'.
Mr Wilson said wine exports were growing strongly. He forecast a significant
increase in profits from the US following the rationalisation of the
recently-acquired Mor-Flo water heater business.
The group's packaging margins came under pressure in the first half
following the loss of a contract to supply cartons to Carlton and United
Breweries, a subsidiary of Foster's Brewing Group.
The loss of the contract was reflected in the beverage and food division's
reduced earnings before tax and interest, which fell to ADollars 36.8m,
compared to ADollars 43.8m in the comparable period of the previous year.
The group said the lower contribution also reflected a fall of 6.3 per cent
in the core South Australian beer market during the period, compared with a
decline of 4.7 per cent in the national market.
SA Brewing said the contribution from the packaging division fell to
ADollars 48.6m from ADollars 49.5m before tax and interest costs. The
appliance division contrib-uted ADollars 33.8m, compared with ADollars
29.8m.
Mr Wilson said the group's balance sheet was strong, and confirmed that the
board had considered a number of potential acquisitions.
The directors declared an unchanged dividend of 7.75 cents a share, fully
franked.
SA Brewing shares closed 4 cents higher at ADollars 3.43 on the Australian
Stock Exchange.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN National Rail-ways, the government-owned railway company, expects
to report 1992 losses of over CDollars 1bn (USDollars 800m), largely
reflecting the cost of severance packages for about 11,000 workers. The
previously-announced job cuts, which will cut CN's workforce by a third, are
due to be implemented over the next three years.
But Mr Paul Tellier, who recently took over as CN president, said the entire
CDollars 900m cost would be taken in the 1992 accounts. The company expects
to pay workers an average of CDollars 80,000 each to entice them to give up
contractual job security.
Both Canada's national rail companies, CN and Canadian Pacific, are in the
throes of far-reaching retrenchment in an effort to improve their
competitiveness against US railways and truck operators.
CP Rail has reported a 1992 loss of CDollars 343m, most due to restructuring
charges, including the cost of reducing the size of train crews.
Mr Tellier predicted that CN would suffer a loss of about CDollars 70m for
1993 but would return to the black in 1994.
Besides the job cuts, CN and CP are anxious to accelerate rationalisation of
their rail networks. This has been slowed by regulatory and political
obstacles. Mr Tellier said CN was negotiating joint use of track with CP. It
planned to sell parts of its network to short-line operators.

cuts

NORTHWEST Airlines, the indebted US carrier in which KLM Royal Dutch
Airlines holds a minority share stake, yesterday offered its employees a 20
per cent equity interest in the company in return for substantial wage
conces-sions.
The company has been negotiating with representatives of the various labour
unions and groups at Northwest. It said yesterday's proposal was 'the
company's best offer for a revised compensation plan'. The lack of progress
in the talks has prompted speculation that the airline might file for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, although Northwest has denied any such
intention.
The carrier, the fourth largest in the US, said the labour cost reductions
needed to be in force by the end of March. It asked labour leaders to agree
to the plan by March 10. Northwest said it might 'fine-tune' its offer, but
could not 'agree to material changes'.
The company is asking contract employees - including its pilots, flight
attendants and mechanics - for cost savings of about Dollars 883m over a
three-year period. Management and non-contract employees would contribute
Dollars 92m. The savings would come from wage reductions, employee
contributions to medical and dental insurance plans, and holiday accrual
rate reductions.
In return, Northwest is offering employees a 20 per cent equity stake and
three seats on a 15-strong board of directors. This would match the three
representatives appointed by KLM, which would see its share stake diluted
pro rata.
Once the employee wage concessions are in place, Northwest will attempt a
financial restructuring. If it has not obtained Dollars 500m of new
permanent capital by the end of June 1995, the employees' stake could
potentially increase to 51 per cent of the equity. PWA, parent of Canadian
Airlines, has sent a revised restructuring plan to senior creditors and
aircraft lessors which reduces the total prepayment of claims through the
issue of rights to buy PWA common stock, Robert Gibbens reports from
Montreal.
The prepayment would be reduced from CDollars 506m (USDollars 400m) to
CDollars 423m. Partly-secured creditors could also take prepayment in
non-interest-bearing 10-year notes.
Holders of PWA subordinated debt, preferred and common stock, would also
receive warrants to buy additional PWA stock.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Marriott bondholders to push on
with fraud claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of bondholders in Marriott Corporation, the US hotels and food
services group which is planning to split itself into two separately-quoted
companies, said yesterday it intended to step up its securities fraud
litigation against the company, writes Nikki Tait.
The bondholder action is led by PPM America, part of the British Prudential
insurance company's investment management division, which holds around
Dollars 200m in Marriott bonds - largely on behalf of Jackson National Life
Insurance Company, the Prudential's US insurance subsidiary.
The demerger scheme involves spinning off the more profitable operational
businesses and leaving most of the group's debt, along with the property
assets, in a separate company.
Marriott bonds dropped sharply as a result, although the group's shares have
soared.
Some bondholders, including PPM America, sued Marriott, charging that the
company failed to disclose its restructuring plan when it was selling new
debt issues to investors last year.
Some of the big US institutional bondholders, however, are negotiating with
Marriott, with a view to a settlement.

DOW CHEMICAL of the US is planning to eliminate about 6 per cent of the jobs
at its corporate headquarters, the company announced yesterday, AP-DJ
reports from Midland, Michigan.
The group posted a Dollars 489m loss for 1992, blaming a glut on the world
chemical market and special charges relating to retiree healthcare benefits
and income tax.
Dow said the costs of the workforce cuts were covered by a Dollars 430m
charge the chemical company took against its fourth-quarter 1992 earnings.
Dow then said the charge would cover asset write-offs and write-downs, plant
shutdowns, divestitures and consolidations.
Between 225 and 275 jobs would be cut at the Michigan office, which employs
about 4,000 people, said Mr Enrique Sosa, president of Dow Chemical's North
American operations.
The company said the cuts resulted from a combination of factors including
slumps in the aerospace, automotive and construction industries, coupled
with increased global competition in a shrinking and depressed worldwide
chemical market.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Australian poll could unlock
door to bank mergers - Kevin Brown analyses the prospects for financial
services if John Hewson wins this month's elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE possibility of a conservative victory in Australia's federal election on
March 13 raises the prospect of a radical shake-up of the troubled banking
sector.
Mr John Hewson, leader of the opposition Liberal/National Party coalition,
has yet to release a considered strategy for the financial services industry
under a conservative government. But, as the coalition increases its lead in
the opinion polls, attention is turning to the likely consequences of the
defeat of the decade-old Labor government, now led by Mr Paul Keating.
The impact of a conservative victory would be felt first by the four trading
banks - National Australia Bank (NAB), Westpac, ANZ and Commonwealth - and
the two big life insurance institutions, AMP Society and National Mutual.
Merger negotiations between the big six have been banned since 1990, when Mr
Keating, the then treasurer, (finance minister) unexpectedly blocked a
proposed merger between ANZ and National Mutual.
Mr Keating's sought to prevent a diminution of competition within and
between the bank and insurance sectors. However, Mr Hewson and Mr Peter
Reith, the opposition's candidate for treasurer, have promised that merger
proposals would be considered 'on their merits'.
Officials say Mr Hewson believes a merger might strengthen competition by
reducing the substantial differences in the financial strength of the banks.
Westpac and ANZ have sustained heavy losses since 1990 on loans secured
against commercial property in the late 1980s, when both banks gave a higher
priority to rapid asset growth than to credit control.
By contrast, NAB has benefited from its more conservative policy of lending
against cash-flow and largely eschewing the risky corporate lending market
in favour of housing loans.
Mr Don Argus, NAB managing director, has publicly played down prospects of a
takeover offer, claiming the bank is fully occupied in digesting its recent
ADollars 1.1bn (USDollars 765m) takeover of the Bank of New Zealand.
However, he is known to have looked closely at the merits of a bid for
either Westpac or ANZ. A management committee is believed to be working on
details of a bid.
Analysts say NAB is likely to be most interested in ANZ, which wrote off
ADollars 1.9bn against bad and doubtful debts last year, but is widely
believed to be on the road to recovery.
Westpac wrote off ADollars 2.6bn last year, but Mr John Uhrig, chairman, has
said the bank's troubles may not be over. Mr Robert Joss, the chief
executive recruited last month from Wells Fargo, is supervising a property
review which may force further provisioning.
Meanwhile, National Mutual has indicated it is still interested in merging
with one of the banks to gain access to a retail branch network, which
offers a cost-effective means of marketing life policies.
Such a merger would give the bank involved greater access to Australia's
growing market in compulsory superannuation contributions, which is emerging
as the biggest growth area in financial services.
It might also provide an escape hatch for one of the weaker banks, probably
ANZ, which had reached an advanced stage in negotiations with National
Mutual when Mr Keating stepped in in 1990.
Westpac and AMP have a more limited marketing arrangement which might also
provide a basis for a merger or close defensive alliance. AMP owns 15 per
cent of Westpac, and the two groups share a number of directors.
An incoming conservative government could drop the ban on mergers without
legislation, but a bid by any of the big six might be opposed by the Trades
Practices Commission, the competition regulator.
The TPC can block mergers if it believes they would lead to 'a substantial
lessening of competition'. The commission has not yet decided how this test
would apply to the banks.
Mr Bernie Fraser, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), told a
parliamentary banking inquiry last year he would not object to a banking
merger on grounds of prudential supervision.
A coalition government would probably draw the line at a single merger.
However, Mr Hewson might also be tempted to allow one of the weaker banks to
be acquired by a strong overseas bank.
Such a takeover would end the balance sheet weaknesses undermining the
sector. But it would require an amendment to the Bank Shareholders' Act,
which would probably be opposed by the non-conservative majority in the
Senate.
Mr Hewson has indicated a conservative government would sell the federal
government's 70 per cent stake in Commonwealth, which was part-privatised by
Labor last year.
Commonwealth has a strong balance sheet and the largest share of the loans
and acceptances market. But it is unlikely to play much part in the
rationalisation of the banking sector until after full privatisation, which
could take some time.
The quoted banking sector will be expanded during the three-year term of the
next parliament by the sale of state-owned banks in South Australia, Western
Australia and New South Wales.
The coalition has also suggested during campaigning that it would set up an
inquiry into the system of prudential supervision, described by Mr Hewson as
'haphazard'.
The inquiry would probably focus on the division of responsibilities between
the RBA, which supervises the trading banks, and the state governments,
which regulate building societies.
But it could be widened to review the roles of the Insurance and
Superannuation Commission, which oversees the life offices, the Australian
Securities Commission, the main corporate regulator, and the Australian
Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
CANADIAN National Railways, the government-owned railway company, expects to
report 1992 losses of over CDollars 1bn (USDollars 800m), largely reflecting
the cost of severance packages for about 11,000 workers. The
previously-announced job cuts, which will cut CN's workforce by a third, are
due to be implemented over the next three years.
But Mr Paul Tellier, who recently took over as CN president, said the entire
CDollars 900m cost would be taken in the 1992 accounts. The company expects
to pay workers an average of CDollars 80,000 each to entice them to give up
contractual job security.
Both Canada's national rail companies, CN and Canadian Pacific, are in the
throes of far-reaching retrenchment in an effort to improve their
competitiveness against US railways and truck operators.
CP Rail has reported a 1992 loss of CDollars 343m, most due to restructuring
charges, including the cost of reducing the size of train crews.
Mr Tellier predicted that CN would suffer a loss of about CDollars 70m for
1993 but would return to the black in 1994.
Besides the job cuts, CN and CP are anxious to accelerate rail network
rationalisation.
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is to restructure its operations in the
Caribbean, Reuter reports from Toronto.
Under the first stage of the plan, which is still subject to regulatory
approval, the bank will create two new companies in Barbados, to be named
CIBC West Indies Holdings and CIBC Caribbean. It will sell and transfer its
branches and trust unit in St Lucia, St Vincent and Antigua to CIBC
Caribbean. CIBC Caribbean will be wholly owned by CIBC West Indies.
In the second stage, CIBC West Indies Holdings will offer shareholders of
the Bank of Commerce Trinidad and Tobago the chance to swap their shares for
those of CIBC West Indies Holdings.

LEVI STRAUSS, the San Francisco-based clothing manufacturer, reported record
sales and earnings for 1992 and became the first apparel company to exceed
Dollars 5bn in annual sales.
The company said worldwide consumer demand for its denim jeans and US demand
for its casual clothing lines were strong.
Levi Strauss Associates, the privately-held parent company of Levi Strauss &amp;
Company, reported net sales for the year of Dollars 5.6bn, a 14 per cent
increase over the Dollars 4.9bn in 1991.
Net income for the year was Dollars 360.8m, up 1 per cent from Dollars
356.6m, despite a Dollars 158m pre-tax stock-option charge in the third
quarter.
Excluding the charge, net income would have been approximately Dollars
475.8m, an increase of 33 per cent over 1991, the company said.
Record revenues and unit sales, a lower effective tax rate and lower
interest expenses contributed to the income rise, the company said.
'Our results are particularly gratifying during a period of economic
uncertainty in many of the markets that we serve worldwide,' said Mr George
James, chief financial officer.
For the fourth quarter of 1992, Levi unveiled net sales of Dollars 1.6bn,
which were up 15 per cent from the same period last year.

COMPANHIA Vale do Rio Doce (CVRD), the state-controlled Brazilian mining
company and a leading exporter of iron ore, unveiled profits of Dollars
299.4m for 1992, against a 1991 earnings figure of Dollars 251.9m.
Net sales were off slightly, to Dollars 2.28bn from Dollars 2.34bn in 1991.
This was due to a 4.9 per cent drop in mineral prices, and a 7 per cent
decline in sales volume, said Mr Vitor Hallack, director of market
relations.
He added that positive factors included a reduction in the company's debt,
to Dollars 1.18bn from Dollars 1.54bn in 1991, and cuts in personnel
expenditures of about Dollars 77m, owing to increased subcontracting of
services.
Freios Varga, a leading Brazilian auto parts company, posted losses of
Dollars 4.4m last year, about half of the Dollars 9.6m it lost in 1991.
The company blamed Brazil's economic and political instability, particularly
high inflation and high interest rates.
Varga, which makes brakes and exports 35 per cent of its production, is
completing the reorganisation of an Argentinian subsidiary, Frenos Varga.

<TEXT>
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines, has sent a revised restructuring plan to
senior creditors and aircraft lessors which reduces the total prepayment of
claims through the issue of rights to buy PWA common stock.
The prepayment would be reduced from CDollars 506m (USDollars 400m) to
CDollars 423m.
Partly-secured creditors could also take prepayment in non-interest-bearing
10-year notes.
Holders of PWA subordinated debt, preferred and common stock, would also
receive warrants to buy additional PWA stock.
As part of the restructuring, employees would invest the equivalent of
CDollars 207m via pay concessions and AMR of the US would invest CDollars
246m in Canadian Airlines for a 25 per cent voting interest.
PWA said that if the revised plan were approved by the senior creditors,
then it could resume paying interest and amounts due to lessors on April 30.
Payments were halted on all non-operating debt last November while the
restructuring plan was worked out.

   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-WERKE, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday revealed
its plan to restructure its steel operations and write off more than 50 per
cent of their outstanding debts.
It is the largest German company to sue for protection from its creditors
under the composition procedure since AEG, the electrical equipment
manufacturer, more than 10 years ago.
It is also the first leading steelmaker to be forced to seek protection in
the latest European steel crisis. The plan, an essential step in the
company's bid to negotiate a debt-relief scheme with leading creditors, was
presented to the local court in Duisburg, where Klockner-Werke is based.
It proposes writing off DM1.4bn (Dollars 848m) of the DM2.7bn owed by the
company's steel subsidiaries, Klockner Stahl and Klockner Edelstahl. The
rest of the group is not affected by the process.
Creditors with their loans secured by property or other assets would receive
60 per cent payment, and other creditors, 40 per cent, the company suggests.
The restructuring involves the closure of one blast furnace at the Bremer
Hutte steel plant in Bremen, reducing raw steel capacity by some 700,000
tonnes, and shedding up to 1,400 jobs.
The company is also negotiating with a group of investors, led by Mr Jurgen
Grossmann, the former chief executive of Klockner Edelstahl, to sell its
plant at Georgsmarienhutte. A decision on that proposal is expected in the
next two weeks, according to a company spokesman, although it depends on the
success of the composition proceedings.
The legal move by Klockner-Werke, one step short of formal bankruptcy
proceedings, was announced in December. The Duisburg judge will seek expert
opinion on the plan from the composition administrator, and from the
Duisburg chamber of commerce and industry. The judge and administrator will
decide whether to summon a creditors' meeting, which must approve the plan
with an 80 per cent vote if it is to succeed.
Deutsche Bank is the com-pany's principal creditor, followed by WestLB, the
state bank in North Rhine-Westphalia. Both are believed to support the move.
The full meeting of creditors is not likely to be called before May.

losses to FM158m (Dollars 26.53m) last year from FM324m in 1991, as sales
rose 18 per cent to FM18.2bn from FM15.5bn.
The group would have made a profit but for the performance of its consumer
electronics division, where operating losses deepened sharply to FM783m
because of worse-than-anticipated conditions in the European market.
However, profits rose substantially within telecommunications and mobile
phones, and the group is confident of further progress this year. Nokia was
heartened by the trend in its performance in the final four months, when
operating profits amounted to FM440m compared with a FM71m loss in the same
1991 period.
This enabled the group to record an operating profit of FM288m for the whole
year after 1991's FM96m loss. A further increase in operating profit is
predicted for 1993, although the group is wary about forecasting an overall
return to the black given continuing currency turbulence.
Nokia is planning additional rationalisation within consumer electronics
this year to cut costs by at least a further FM200m. It is also looking to
form alliances with other groups within the tubes and home electronics
sectors.
'The difficult situation in the market place means internal measures alone
are not enough,' said Mr Jorma Ollila, president and chief executive.
Sales at Nokia Telecommunications rose 73 per cent to FM3.21bn last year and
operating profit amounted to FM427m. Mobile phones recorded a FM437m
operating profit on a 45 per cent increase in sales to FM3.64bn. Consumer
electronics saw a 9 per cent rise in sales to FM5.76bn. This is the first
time the group has specified operating profit for each of its individual
divisions.
The group said sales of mobile phones doubled, helping it to consolidate its
position as Europe's leading mobile phone manufacturer.
The group loss after extraordinary items rose to FM723m from FM211m. The
group made a FM332m profit on the sale of its shareholdings in the European
soft tissue maker Jamont and a Finnish power company. But it is taking a
FM342m provision to cover the costs of further rationalisation within
consumer electronics this year. The FM2.00 per share dividend is maintained.

VIAG, the German energy-based conglomerate, is likely to maintain its
dividend despite a 9 per cent fall in profits last year.
The group, which last summer forecast higher earnings and its ninth
consecutive pay-out increase, said yesterday that performance had been hit
by the accelerating downturn in the second half.
There were no real signs of improvement in the German economy, although the
company said it expected the worst to be over in some business areas in the
second half of the current year.
Cost-cutting programmes and structural adjustments would continue, it added.
Numbers employed rose 14 per cent to 84,200 during the year as a result of
consolidating recent acquisitions, although on a like-for-like basis the
workforce was cut by 3 per cent.
Net profits of DM370m (Dollars 225.4m), on sales up 3 per cent at DM24.3bn,
were eroded by falling income from the can-making and trading interests.
Results from the glass business, grouped under the Gerresheimer subsidiary,
were 'heavily burdened' by over-capacity and import competition.
The rise in group turnover was largely attributable to the inclusion for the
first time of sales from Viag's one-third stake in the Kuhne &amp; Nagel
shipping and freight concern.
Profits from chemicals, the group's third-largest sector after energy and
aluminium, 'improved significantly', while sales fell from DM1.9bn to
DM1.6bn.
Increased earnings were attributed to good demand for special products for
the building industry and structural changes in the metallurgy business.
Restructuring also helped improve results in fire protection, where sales
were virtually unchanged at DM1.4bn.
Deliveries of electricity and natural gas from the energy subsidiaries,
which contributed DM3.6bn to group sales compared with DM3.2bn last time,
were unchanged and earnings remained at the high level of the previous year.
Earnings from aluminium were also unchanged despite the impact on prices of
shipments from the former Soviet Union.

SPAIN'S second-tier electrical utilities reported lowered results yesterday,
reflecting the impact of two devaluations of the peseta in the final quarter
of last year.
Union Fenosa raised its group profits by just 1.7 per cent to Pta19bn
(Dollars 161m) despite raising its sales by 6.5 per cent to Pta308bn,
Sevillana, which raised its sales by 6.6 per cent to Pta249bn, dropped its
consolidated income by 3.3 per cent to Pta12.7bn, and Fecsa, which posted a
3.7 per cent fall in sales to Pta208.6bn, registered an 8.5 per cent fall in
profits to Pta15.4bn.
They were penalised by the peseta devaluations of 5 per cent and then of 6
per cent in September and November respectively last year. Union Fenosa
holds 33 per cent of its debt in foreign currencies and the proportion at
Sevillana and Fecsa is 27 per cent and 25 per cent respectively.
Earlier, Iberdrola, the Spanish electricity producer, posted a 7.5 per cent
drop in pre-tax profits to Pta78.5bn. The company, which has 31 per cent of
its debt in foreign currencies, borrowed strongly in dollars and yen and it
registered a year-on-year Pta50bn increase of its global debt at the end of
last December.
In contrast, Endesa, Iberdrola's state-owned rival which has only 14 per
cent of its debt in non-peseta denominations, posted net income of
Pta106.2bn, a 13.6 per cent increase on 1991, and raised its dividend by the
same percentage to Pta408 per share.
Endesa's profits were in line with those of previous years and could fuel
plans by INI, the state industrial holding, to place part of the 76 per cent
stake it holds in the utility.

THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, and
Short Brothers, the Belfast aerospace subsidiary of Bombardier of Canada,
yesterday agreed to join forces to make very short-range ground-to-air
missiles.
The move sparked anger from Matra Defense, France's main private sector
defence electronics group, against which the Thomson-CSF-Shorts joint
venture will compete. Normally, the French defence industry avoids competing
against itself, on national interest grounds.
Thomson-CSF and Short Brothers will have an equal share in the venture, to
be called Shorts Missile Systems in the UK and Thomson Shorts Systemes in
France. It will have a FFr1bn (Dollars 179m) annual turnover, representing
one-fifth of the world market for this type of weapon, with a top range of
3km.
Thomson-CSF denied the venture would compete directly with Matra. Matra's
Mistral used an infra-red guidance system which made it suitable for use
against heat-emitting targets such as jet fighters, while Shorts' missiles
were laser guided, and so more suitable for cooler targets such as
helicopters, said a Thomson-CSF official.
Shorts will make the missiles, while Thomson-CSF will produce the
electronics and guidance systems.

UNIBANK, the Danish bank, yesterday reported a 1992 loss of DKr4.66bn
(Dollars 737m), compared with losses of DKr1.65bn in 1991. This is the
biggest loss ever reported by a Danish bank.
Mr Hugo Schroder, chairman of the supervisory board, will resign at the
bank's annual meeting in April 'as a consequence of the highly
unsatisfactory result for the bank in 1992'.
The company will not pay a dividend for the second consecutive year.
The capital adequacy ratio at the end of the year was 11.6 per cent on a
balance sheet which was slimmed from DKr263bn to DKr221bn. Equity capital
declined from DKr15.4bn to DKr10.7bn while the total capital base was
unchanged at DKr20.8bn.
Mr Thorleif Krarup, chief executive, said the bank did not expect to need
new capital in 1993. He forecast a reduced loss and a moderate further
reduction in the balance sheet for the current year.
He said that on an unchanged balance sheet total equity capital would need
replenishing if the bank loses much more than DKr3bn in 1993.
The 1992 loss was caused by bad loss provisions of DKr6.28bn, up from
DKr5.4bn in 1991, and a loss on the value adjustment of the securities
portfolio of DKr492m compared with gain of DKr1.15bn in 1991. A loss of
DKr656m, up from DKr487m in 1991, by the bank's London subsidiary,
Unidanmark Holding, contributed to the group's loss.
The losses in London have arisen almost entirely as a result of property
engagements.
The bank's forecast of a reduced loss in 1993 assumes unchanged interest
rates and share prices (which fell by 25 per cent last year), continued
slack demand for credit and high bad loss provisions.

Viag, which has expanded rapidly since it was privatised in 1988, appeared
last year to slow its acquisition programme and focus more sharply on
consolidating its interests. The group spent less than DM600m on
acquisitions last year, compared with DM2.3bn in 1991.
However, the creation of a new division, transport and logistics, to house
the Kuhne &amp; Nagel business suggests it has further ambitions in this area.
Capital investment rose 11 per cent to DM1.9bn last year, as the company
completed a primary aluminium plant in Canada and its new drinks can works
in Saxony-Anhalt.

REPSOL, the Spanish oil and gas conglomerate being prepared for further
partial privatisation by the Spanish government, yesterday reported a 1.8
per cent increase in net profits for 1992, to Pta71.43bn (Dollars 607m),
despite a sharp drop in cash flow.
Repsol said it was delighted with the results, 'particularly if one compares
them with the rest of the sector'. Operating profits fell nearly Pta10bn to
Pta119.8bn, while cash-flow, after tax, fell 10.4 per cent to Pta154.06bn.
The Spanish government is planning to place up to 40m shares in Repsol -
roughly 13.3 per cent of the group - with institutions in the Spanish and
international markets before the end of May. The flotation could raise close
to Dollars 1bn and, if fully used, will reduce the state's holding from 54.5
per cent to just over 40 per cent.
Repsol said it had managed to squeeze the most out of a difficult year
thanks to good returns on some recent investments and the impact of a tough
cost reduction programme. The group had shed nearly 2,000 jobs over the
year, bringing the workforce to 19,632 people.
It posted a 77 per cent increase in operating profits to Pta18.6bn in its
exploration and production division thanks, it said, to exploration
successes and to a 20 per cent increase in crude production.
As expected, however, Repsol's troubled chemicals division continued to
suffer along with the rest of the international chemicals industry, losing
Pta7.9bn after making a meagre operating profit of Pta1.2bn in 1991.
The Repsol refining and marketing division saw operating income fall more
than 16 per cent to Pta86.6bn partly because of new accounting rules, partly
because it is having to shed service stations belonging to the Campsa group
under EC monopoly rules and, lastly, because of tighter margins for refined
products in international markets.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: ASW incurs Pounds 10.8m deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED PRESSURE on margins pushed ASW Holdings, the Cardiff-based steel
and wire group, deep into the red last year, but the shares yesterday jumped
20p to 153p amid hopes of an upturn in steel prices.
The pre-tax deficit of Pounds 10.8m for 1992, struck after restructuring
costs of Pounds 4.6m, compared with a profit of Pounds 2.3m.
The operating loss for the second half of 1992 was virtually the same as
that for the first six months.
Turnover fell 6 per cent to Pounds 367.8m (Pounds 390.7m). Losses per share
were 16.2p (1.9p).
The recommended final dividend is 3p, making 6p (9p) for the year.
Net borrowings were Pounds 17.2m, with gearing at the year end of 14.5 per
cent.
Mr Alan Cox, chief executive, said 'abnormally low prices', at below 1982
levels, caused the poor outcome.
Nevertheless, the group maintained volumes and made a profit on its basic
steel operations.
'We remain one of the lowest cost producers in Europe, and have have again
improved our cost base.
'Last year prices were reaching loss-making proportions across Europe; now
they are recovering, and I expect to see a real improvement in results for
the next half,' he added.
With scrap prices up to about Pounds 70 a tonne from Pounds 53 at the start
of the year, analysts estimated that margins for scrap-based products were
improving markedly. Prices for other products - like wire rod and
reinforcement bar in coil and length - were also rising.
COMMENT
ASW's reputation as a low cost producer remains untarnished despite
yesterday's results, but with 40 per cent of its business on the Continent,
in the immediate future it needs a recovery in European steel prices more
than Mr Lamont's green shoots. Efforts to promote that recovery appear to be
under way. But are they enough and will they be sustained? Regarding the
state of Europe's steel industry, and the nervousness of the Commission in
tackling state aids in their numerous guises, it is hard to be confident on
either front. But with analysts predicting a 1993 profit of Pounds 12m
pre-tax, and a prospective p/e of 15, things are looking up short-term.

Inoco, the USM-quoted property investor, reduced losses from Pounds 6.82m to

The outcome was struck after a profit on the sale of investments of Pounds
111,000 (losses of Pounds 3.1m) now treated as an exceptional rather than
extraordinary item.
Losses of Pounds 2.46m on sale of fixed assets, Pounds 96,000 on sale of
trading stocks and a provision of Pounds 1.6m against carrying value of
trading stocks were also taken above the line.
Losses per share were 2.06p against a restated 3.29p.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sharp decline to Pounds 80,651 at Goodwin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Goodwin, the Stoke-on-Trent engineering company, reported pre-tax profits
for the six months to October 31 of Pounds 80,651, a little more than a
third of the comparable Pounds 232,040.
Turnover fell 8 per cent, from Pounds 7.13m to Pounds 6.59m.
The company said that reorganisation had been undertaken to improve
efficiency. Investment in exports remained high and as a result margins were
unlikely to recover before the end of the year.
Earnings per share came out at 0.75p (2.16p).

<TEXT>
Losses before tax at CountyGlen, the Dublin-based property investor and
trader, rose from IPounds 153,000 to IPounds 170,000 (Pounds 175,000), for
the six months ended October 31.
Directors stressed that the deficit mainly represented costs incurred in
finalising agreements in the UK for CountyGlen to recover its Pounds 500,000
loan to the Videoplus distributors as well as write-offs of rent accepted by
the company to obtain possession of the Blackrock site.
The company added that it was examining a number of merger and takeover
suggestions but it was too early to bring them to shareholders. The shares
have been suspended since October 20.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Platon repeats call for no action on bid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robin Meyer, chairman of Platon International, has written to
shareholders of the USM-quoted instrumentation group, repeating the board's
earlier advice to take no action on the bid from Wills Group.
The letter follows the publication of Wills' offer document in which Mr
David Massie, chairman, said there were a number of advantages of a merger,
including complementary product ranges, geographic fit and opportunities for
an increase in sales.
He also drew attention to the recent achievements of Wills, an industrial,
electronic and automotive products company. They included a return to
profits, a strong balance sheet and reduced bank borrowings. They compared
with Platon's recent losses, lack of dividend and qualified accounts.
The 5-for-4 share offer values Platon at Pounds 2.93m, or 27 1/2 p a share.
Platon's shares were unchanged at 25p yesterday while Wills' rose  1/2 p to
22p. Wills claims undertakings to accept representing 15.7 per cent of
Platon.
Wills also published details of its rights issue to raise Pounds 5.4m. The
34m shares are offered at 16p on the basis of 1-for-3 ordinary, 1-for-3
warrants and 10-for-3 preference.

<TEXT>
MCLEOD Russel Holdings, the paints producer and distributor which last month
launched a hostile bid for Wheway, the struggling environmental group,
yesterday despatched formal offer documents on its 1-for-10 offer to Wheway
shareholders.
The McLeod board said it believed that was in the best interests of
shareholders, employees and creditors of Wheway that a rapid transfer of
control was accomplished because Wheway was a 'company in distress'.
Other interested parties had been aware of the 'For Sale' sign on Wheway
since December 23 1992, and no other parties had announced an offer, McLeod
directors asserted.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring plans halve Beauford shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Beauford, the manufacturer of material handling equipment and
machine tools, halved to 7p yesterday after the announcement of a capital
reorganisation.
The company is proposing to split its 10p ordinary shares into one 1p
ordinary and nine 1p deferred shares. The 7p convertible preference shares
will be converted into four ordinary and six deferred shares and all arrears
of the preference dividend will be eliminated.
The deferred are considered valueless and application to cancel them will be
made as soon as possible.
The plans would leave preference holders with 86.9 per cent of the new
capital as against 44.2 per cent under the existing conversion rights.
Beauford warned that without the restructuring there would be limited scope
for future development.
The company reported losses in 1991 and the first half of 1992. In September
1992, after the sale of its interest in EW Bliss, borrowings were Pounds
13.3m against net assets of Pounds 7.3m. By the end of the year borrowings
had fallen to Pounds 11.7m but the company expected to have to make
substantial write-downs in the value of its assets and make provisions for
restructuring costs in the accounts for the year.
Gearing is considered too high and a debt reduction plan in conjunction with
the company's banks is being pursued.
It has not paid preference dividends since July 1991, leaving arrears at
January 1 of Pounds 1.9m, or ordinary dividends since November 1991.
Taking into account the trading and financial position the board thinks that
there is no prospect of paying the arrears or resuming dividend payments of
the preferential shares in the foreseeable future.
In addition, the ability to redeem the preference shares by July 1 2003
would require an extraordinary and sustained improvement in the trading
performance throughout the period to redemption.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Citibank Investments buys assets of
Randsworth Trust
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CITIBANK Investments, a wholly owned subsidiary of the US bank, is acquiring
the assets of Randsworth Trust, a London property company, the parent of
which has been in receivership for the past year.
Citibank is facing a book loss of more than Pounds 100m on the deal, on
which its exposure of Pounds 310m compares with assets valued at about
Pounds 200m.
This is the most prominent example of a bank taking control of a property
company in the UK since Barclay's acquisition of Imry at the end of last
year.
Citibank said its decision reflected confidence in the company's prospects.
Citibank's involvement in Randsworth dates back to 1989, when it backed a
Pounds 258m acquisition of the company by JMB Realty, a US investment group.
This deal, which was the first large investment in the UK property market by
US investors, proved disastrous.
As the value of Randsworth's portfolio in the West End of London halved in
value, the shareholders - who injected a further Pounds 58m in 1991  - lost
their equity.
Even the debenture holders, who had first claim on the assets of London &amp;
Provincial Shop Centres, Randsworth's chief subsidiary, lost money.
Last month, Citibank agreed to repay Pounds 135m of debentures at a price of
Pounds 95 for Pounds 100 of stock, in the first time in recent memory that
holders of secured bonds have accepted a loss. At the same time, it said it
intended to buy all or part of Randsworth.
Citibank Investments has set up a company called CIPL to own Randsworth. The
portfolio consists of 35 office and retail buildings in the West End,
including 25 Berkeley Square, 91 Kensington High Street and St Christopher's
Place, an area of shops, offices and restaurants near Oxford Street.
Citibank excluded from its acquisition two small properties which have
negative value.
Mr Nigel Kempner, a former joint managing director, said the deal would
allow the management to concentrate on enhancing the value of the business.
'Citibank is prepared to take a long term view of the property market,' he
said.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Fragile reappearance of customer confidence
 -Flames of hope spark sharp rally in share prices of leading motor
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the purest recovery plays in the stock market is the motor trade. Car
dealers proved particularly vulnerable to high interest rates, which raised
their financing costs and reduced custom. Now that 'double whammy' has
flipped into reverse.
Share prices of the leading quoted groups have outperformed the market by
nearly 40 per cent over the past three months - the flames of hope fanned by
the revival of interest in smaller, UK-orientated, companies.
This year sales of new cars are forecast to rise by about 7 per cent to
1.7m. It would reverse a trend which has seen the market fall from a record
2.3m in 1989 to less than 1.6m in both 1991 and 1992.
The picture also looks better for used cars as the lower levels of new car
sales feed through into a shortage of quality second-hand ones.
If firmer demand can be used to improve profit margins from the niggardly 1
to 2 per cent brought about by widespread discounting, bottom lines could
revive quite rapidly.
However, most of these rosy factors are for the future. Few of the motor
traders due to report 1992 results over the next few weeks will show a
rebound in their figures.
Two exceptions are T Cowie and Lex Service.
Cowie, which has a substantial fleet leasing operation - and hence
substantial debt - went through the fire in 1990 when pre-tax profit fell to
Pounds 9m. Interest costs soared to Pounds 44.6m and the dividend was cut.
Profit is estimated to have recovered to Pounds 23m last year - not far
short of the Pounds 25.8m peak recorded in 1988.
Lex, which slumped to Pounds 500,000 pre-tax in 1991 and cut the dividend,
is expected to have bounced back to Pounds 25m.
The group's exit from electronic components has proved highly profitable
through a residual investment in Arrow of the US. Payments from Volvo to end
an import agreement have cleared debts and allowed the Pounds 46m purchase
of Swan National to boost the dealership network.
While these two put most of their troubles behind them, one or two others -
such as Pendragon and Reg Vardy - have limited the recessionary damage and
enhanced their managerial reputations.
More commonly, however, motor traders' profits have remained bogged down.
Among the laggards is Appleyard Group, one of the oldest names. Its
expansion ran out of steam after the purchase of Ian Skelly in 1989. In 1991
profits slumped to Pounds 1.81m and the dividend was uncovered. The figures
may be worse for 1992 and a dividend cut is feared.
Companies which disappointed at the interim stage included Evans Halshaw and
Perry Group, while Lookers was more than 40 per cent down at the pre-tax
level in the year to September.
But even the laggards have outperformed the market.
Apart from the recovery arguments, a number of other issues have gingered up
the sector and should continue to do so.
The first is takeover talk. Popular choices of predator are Cowie and Lex.
The former tried unsuccessfully to acquire Henlys in a hostile bid last
year, but remains keen to expand both its dealership network and its leasing
fleet - the latter from 60,000 to 100,000 cars.
Nor has Lex made any secret of its expansion plans, with the priority going
to car retail. A substantial deal could propel it to the top of the motor
retail league, as monitored by the magazine Automotive Management.
The two organisations ahead of it are Inchcape's UK motor retail operation,
a small part of an international concern, and Automotive and Financial Group
(AFG), controlled by Mr Octav Botnar.
Inchcape has cut dealerships from 110 to 87 since last March's takeover of
TKM. AFG has had to react to the loss of the Nissan franchise by finding
replacements.
Turning to the mooted acquisition targets, the most frequently cited are
Appleyard, Lookers and Perry Group, all quoted, and Dutton Forshaw, part of
Lonrho.
The background to the speculation is that the sector remains fragmented. The
long list of quoted motor traders only accounts for a small portion of the
market.
Last year saw a fair amount of consolidation. Apart from the Inchcape-TKM
and Lex-Swan deals, Hartwell won control of Trimoco, and emergent motor
groups - such as European Motor Holdings and Sanderson Murray &amp; Elder -
added to their portfolios.
An advantage the smaller groups have is that they have some way to go before
bumping up against the limits imposed by Ford, which still has about 22 per
cent of the new car market.
Hartwell was left with 12 Ford dealerships after the Trimoco takeover, four
more than Ford's limit.
Ford says agreement has been reached for four to be sold off. It is sticking
to its rules, which also limit location, in spite of criticism of
manufacturers' restrictions in a Monopolies and Mergers Commission report
published last year.
Ford's stance, which contrasts with Rover and Vauxhall's modified
approaches, also has a bearing on another big issue in the motor trade:
multi-franchising. This involves a company selling a variety of makes of new
car either on one site or from a local network of sites.
Evans Halshaw, for instance, is developing two multi-franchise sites in the
Birmingham area. One is orientated towards Japanese makes, the other will
bring together Vauxhall, Rover and Toyota.
Currie Motors, on the other hand, which has nine showrooms in London, has
recently switched from Ford to five new franchises, although there will be
only one brand of new car available at each site.
Ford argues that multi-franchising will enable local dealerships to be
concentrated in too few hands, and that it will compromise after sales
service - in terms of the range of parts carried and the skill of fitters.
As about 28 per cent of cars on UK roads are Fords, the after-sales
operation has considerable weight. This is not the case with the Japanese
makes, which are not yet around in sufficient numbers.
However, the build-up of UK-made Japanese cars is a big issue in the new car
market. Mr Rob Golding, motors analyst at SG Warburg, says Japanese cars are
forecast to increase their share from 11 to 25 per cent by 1996. A key
factor is that fleet buyers will increasingly consider the home-grown models
 -and corporate sales account for 60 per cent of the new car market.
This has led motor traders to queue up for Japanese franchises, although the
weak after-sales outlook has led Cowie, for instance, to utter reservations
about 'rushing in in a big way'.
While the Japanese build-up offers a long-term opportunity, the dealers'
immediate attention will be focused on the Budget. Mr Golding says the money
which the Treasury has given up in car sales tax will be raised from
motorists in some other way.
Given the level of recovery hope in the share prices, there is a fear that
increased road tax or petrol duty could hinder the fragile reappearance of
customer confidence and make 1993 another year of disappointment.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Acquisitions help Lilleshall advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LILLESHALL, the industrial distribution and building products group, lifted
pre-tax profits by 30 per cent, from Pounds 2.4m to Pounds 3.1m, in the year
to December 31 1992.
The rise was mainly due to the acquisition in January 1992 of Crystalware
Products, the plastic housewares and garden products manufacturer, and the
purchase of Bradgrange Packaging in February.
The shares closed up 3p at 133p. Lilleshall's stock, which had fallen below
100p, has been climbing since late December.
Barlow Fastener Centres was acquired too late in the year to affect profits.
The acquisitions brought gearing to 33 per cent by the year end.
Currency movements on the group's French franc borrowings also increased
gearing and pushed interest payments from Pounds 33,000 in 1991 to Pounds
539,000 in 1992.
Mr John Leek, chairman, said that since the year end gearing had reached 40
per cent but was budgeted to come down as more stocks were taken out of the
business, especially from industrial consumables which it said was
overstocked.
Group turnover rose from Pounds 36.7m to Pounds 52.1m and a final dividend
of 2.65p is proposed, making a total of 4.25p (4p) for the year. Fully
diluted earnings per share rose 15 per cent from 8.5p to 9.8p.
The building products division recorded a small drop in operating profits
from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 2.3m. The plastics and engineering division
produced higher operating profits of Pounds 1.68m (Pounds 446,000) with most
of the increase from the Crystalware acquisition. The group recorded reduced
losses on industrial consumables of Pounds 461,000 (Pounds 628,000).
There was an exceptional gain of Pounds 81,000, masking a Pounds 522,000
provision against stocks following refocusing of the fastener division. This
was offset by gains including Pounds 230,000 proceeds from litigation and a
Pounds 202,000 release of pension provisions.
These were released because the company closed its defined benefits pension
scheme (which relates pension income to final earnings) and invited all
employees to join a contracted out scheme. The group does not expect to pay
out less as a proportion of gross income but said the move had been prompted
by possible changes in pensions law.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Differences in management style at Tate &amp;
Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Shaw, who is chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugars and sweeteners
group, who is adding 'executive' to his title, and Mr Stephen Brown, chief
executive, who yesterday left the group after less than two years following
'differences in management style', writes Maggie Urry.
Mr Shaw said he would be easing out of some of his outside interests. Mr
Paul Lewis will become deputy chairman as well as finance director. Mr Shaw
said he did not expect his role to change. Instead of a single chief
executive reporting to him there would be four people. These four, with Mr
Shaw and Mr Lewis, will form the group's executive management committee. The
four, all in their 40s, are likely to be contenders to succeed Mr Shaw, who
is 63. They are:
Mr Paul Mirsky, 46, who is joining the board and will add the North American
sugar business to his role running the Australian activities. He was
described by one analyst as the 'even money favourite',
Mr John Walker, 48, also joining the board and becoming managing director of
the European sugar business,
Mr Stuart Strathdee, 41, not a board member but to become managing director
of the international division,
Mr Larry Pillard, 45, also not a main board director. He joined the group
last year to head the problematic AE Staley corn wet milling business in the
US.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Quality Software seeks quote

<TEXT>
QUALITY SOFTWARE Prod-ucts, a small computer software company based in
Gateshead, plans to seek a stock exchange listing later this month.
It wants to raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m to fund expansion.
Formed in 1981, the company is a leading UK accounting software supplier.
Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, said the listing would enable Quality Software to
develop a new product line - Universal Olas - and engage in joint products
'with a large number of companies which have expressed interest.'
Pre-tax profits for 1992 were expected to be Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.5m in
1991), before Pounds 600,000 of exceptional costs, on turnover of Pounds
13.1m (Pounds 11.1m).
The company is expected to be valued at about Pounds 25m.
It currently has some 130 customers, mostly large.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical gets Pounds 150m price
tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLLIDAY Chemical Holdings is to raise about Pounds 70m through the largest
flotation yet this year, valuing the synthetic dyestuffs and speciality
chemicals company at about Pounds 150m.
Mr Michael Peagram, founder, chairman and largest single shareholder, said
the company decided to increase by Pounds 5m to Pounds 35m the amount it
will raise to reduce debt.
This followed some concerns in the City that the company would be saddling
itself with a balance sheet that was unnecessarily highly geared.
Raising this amount of capital would lead to gearing of about 34 per cent,
on a pro-forma basis at the end of 1992, and interest nine times covered by
operating profits.
Holliday is coming to the market through a firm placing of 75 per cent of
the shares; the balance will be available through public offer.
The issue will be priced on March 25; applications will be accepted until
April 1 and dealing will begin on April 14.
The venture capitalists who backed the original buy-out of Holliday from
Holliday Dyes and Chemicals in 1987, will be selling about half of their
overall shareholding.
Holliday's earnings per share have increased from 4.4p in 1988 to 9.7p last
year. Sales last year rose by Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 97m and operating
profit by Pounds 5m to Pounds 14m.
Mr Peagram said he was comfortable with the higher level of gearing - he had
been used to running a company financed largely by venture capital when
interest cover was as low as three times.
The balance of comment from the City had, however, been 'why not raise
Pounds 5m more' to reduce pro-forma gearing from about 46 per cent, the
company said.
Mr Peagram said the group was intent on growing organically but that in the
medium term there would be further cash calls to fund acquisitions.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brabant returns to the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRABANT Resources, the oil and gas explorer being stalked by fellow USM
company Aberdeen Petroleum, yesterday announced a return to the black with
profits of Pounds 366,000 for the year to December 31.
The turnround, which compared with a loss of Pounds 4.8m last time, was
struck on sales 86 per cent higher at Pounds 5.4m. The improvement was
largely due to the acquisition of producing assets from Monument Oil &amp; Gas
in the second half.
Brabant said it had increased average net oil production during the year by
52 per cent to 1,786 barrels per day. The Monument acquisition had left it
well placed to fund future exploration, the company said.
Brabant could 'rely on internally generated funds to support its exploration
and development programme for the foreseeable future'.
Mr Malcolm Butler, managing director, said the group could now begin
exploring its own prospects, as opposed to ones dictated by obligations such
as those arising through acquisitions. A substantial drilling programme, to
be funded through cash flow, was planned for 1994. It was unlikely that the
company would seek investment from shareholders for this programme.
Any payment of a dividend would depend on exploration success - as in
previous years there is again no pay-out.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Rowland's salary rises despite 'difficult'
year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR TINY Rowland's salary and emoluments rose from Pounds 1.6m to Pounds
1.65m in the year to September 1992, according to Lonrho's annual report
which was published yesterday.
Mr Rowland, joint chief executive of the international trading group, saw
his salary rise by Pounds 48,401 in a year in which the group's pre-tax
profits fell from Pounds 205m to Pounds 80m.
In his message to shareholders Mr Rowland said: 'This past year has been the
most difficult in your company's financial history.'
Lonrho said Mr Rowland's overall pay included his remuneration as chairman,
which he briefly took over when Sir Edward du Cann resigned, as well as
expense allowances and benefits in kind.
The annual report also shows that a significant amount of borrowings have
become secured. Some Pounds 140m (Pounds 54m) of long-term loans are
secured. Of the short-term loans Pounds 90m (Pounds 52m) is secured.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: New chiefs at Tate &amp; Lyle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL Shaw, chairman of Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugars and sweeteners group, who
is adding 'executive' to his title, and Mr Stephen Brown, chief executive,
who yesterday left the group after less than two years following
'differences in management style', writes Maggie Urry.
Mr Shaw said that he would be easing out of some of his outside interests.
Mr Paul Lewis will become deputy chairman as well as finance director.
Mr Shaw said he did not expect his role to change. Instead of a single chief
executive reporting to him there would be four people. These four, with Mr
Shaw and Mr Lewis, will form the group's executive management committee.
The four, all in their 40s, are likely to be contenders to succeed Mr Shaw,
who is 63.
They are:
Mr Paul Mirsky, 46, who is joining the board and will add the North American
sugar business to his role running the Australian activities. He was
described by one analyst as the 'even money favourite',
Mr John Walker, 48, also joining the board and becoming managing director of
the European sugar business. He already runs the UK sugar operation,
Mr Stuart Strathdee, 41, not a board member but to become managing director
of the international division,
Mr Larry Pillard, 45, also not a main board director. He joined the group
last year to head the problematic AE Staley corn wet milling business in the
US.
Mr Shaw said a new remuneration and appointments committee comprising
non-executive directors would be formed. This would 'have very strong
control over me, the board and the senior management of the company'.
Mr Murray McEwen, currently managing director of the North American sugar
division is retiring on April 1.

MR JOHN ASHCROFT, former Coloroll group chairman, confirmed yesterday that
Survival Aids, the outdoor clothing company which was his first acquisition
following Coloroll's collapse with debts of about Pounds 350m, is having
problems over refinancing.
Mr Ashcroft, chairman of the Cumbria-based company, declined to elaborate.
He said rumours that receivers had been called in were incorrect.
'The refinancing had been agreed but there was a bit of trouble,' he said.
It had not yet been completely sorted out,' he added.
In January, Mr Ashcroft said he had not been happy with Survival Aids'
payment situation and was nervous about trading prospects this year.
Last month, he stepped down as managing director making way for Mr Hugh
Lapham, a former B&amp;Q director.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Trafalgar to press on with cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR House is to proceed with its rights issue after winning support
from small shareholders at yesterday's extraordinary meeting.
The engineering, construction and shipping group already had more than 274m
proxy votes, mainly from institutional investors, in favour of its Pounds
204.5m cash call with only 800,332 against.
Directors were visibly relieved that small shareholders, after voicing
criticism of the management, voted overwhelmingly in favour of the 1-for-2
rights issue at 60p.
Small shareholders voted at the recent annual meeting against reappointing
Touche Ross, the auditors, after 1991 results were restated.
Although institutional investors voted in favour of retaining the auditors,
Trafalgar said it would look at the question later this year.
Small shareholders yesterday asked whether the Pounds 120m of exceptional
losses and write-downs which may be required in the year to end-September
would be the last word on the subject.
The warning of further write-downs followed the decision to announce
substantial write-downs for 1992.
Mr Alan Clements, chairman, said: 'I cannot say that this is the last final
word on the subject.'
The rights issue proceeds will be used to repay borrowings. Mr Clements said
it would take the pressure off the group to make quick disposals. The group
has said it wants to sell its hotels, which include the Ritz and the
Stafford.
Mr Clements said there were no plans to change the group's advisers, which
include Kleinwort Benson and UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, or to make further changes
to the board. other than those already announced. He accepted that
non-executive directors, who include Mr Tony Ryan, chairman of GPA, the
aircraft leasing company, and Mr David Howell, Conservative MP, 'did not
realise early on enough the problems facing the company'. Mr Clements is
non-executive chairman.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Suter takes stake in Wilkes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUTER, the conglomerate chaired by Mr David Abell, has taken a 8.9 per cent
stake in James Wilkes, the engineer which last year fought off a hostile bid
from Petrocon.
Suter said it bought the shares for 'investment purposes' and had not
decided what further action to take. A decision is 'not imminent', a company
adviser said.
Wilkes's shares, which had fallen from a high last year of 190p to 48p,
yesterday jumped 18p to 66p on takeover speculation. The company refused to
comment until Suter's intentions 'become clearer'.
Suter is reknowned for taking small stakes in companies and not necessarily
making a bid. Last year it built up a 7.4 per cent stake in Brown &amp; Tawse,
the steel and pipeline group, again insisting the stake was for investment
purposes.
Yesterday's move is Suter's first since publication in January of a DTI
report on share dealings by Suter and Mr Abell in the mid 1980s.
The report found no evidence that these and other parties acted in concert,
but strongly criticised Mr Abell and questioned the timing of his private
share purchases in Suter's bid targets. Last month Suter announced Mr Abell
had been cleared of insider dealing by the DTI.
Petrocon's all-share bid valued Wilkes at about Pounds 35m. Since then,
Wilkes' shares have tumbled, partly because of an interim loss announced in
October. The company's market capitalisation, before Suter started building
its stake, was only about Pounds 8m.

HOLDERS of Control Securities' two Swiss franc bond issues agreed yesterday
to defer interest payments until June 1.
They also waived the right to declare the bonds in default until the same
date by which time further meetings will be held.
Control, the property, brewing and leisure group, is in the middle of a
financial restructuring which is taking longer to complete than originally
hoped. The company recently revealed a deficit on shareholders' funs of
Pounds 31.8m.
Shareholders have been asked to a meeting on March 17 to authorise continued
discussions while the banks have repeatedly renewed a standstill agreement.
The group has exchanged contracts for the sale for Pounds 3.44m of a housing

<TEXT>
STAKIS, the hotels and casinos group where the corporate rescue specialist
Sir Lewis Robertson is chairman, paid Pounds 90,000 to Mr David Michels, its
chief executive, when he joined the company in December 1991.
This emerged yesterday from Stakis's report for the year to September 30
1992.
Mr Michels was paid a total of Pounds 258,000 in the 1992 financial year. At
the time he joined the company it was about to report a loss of Pounds
47.4m.
Stakis said it had been necessary to offer Mr Michels special inducements to
leave a secure and well paid job at Hilton UK, where he was deputy chairman
and managing director.
Directors now felt that, with Stakis back in profit, Mr Michels' extra
remuneration had been well justified.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Inquiry into MCC foreign exchanges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS probing the affairs of Maxwell Communication Corporation
believe they have uncovered false foreign exchange transactions allegedly
used by the late Mr Robert Maxwell to boost substantially the insolvent
publishing company's pre-tax profits.
Price Waterhouse, administrators to MCC, claim in a New York bankruptcy
court filing that pre-tax profits were overstated by at least Pounds 36.9m
in the year to end-March 1991. MCC posted pre-tax profits of Pounds 145.5m
in the period, including Pounds 80.7m of foreign exchange gains.
According to Mr David Lee, head of the litigation and special investigation
services unit at Price Waterhouse, investigation of MCC's 1991 profits show
that at least some of the foreign exchange transactions may never have taken
place. His investigators have examined four photocopies of documents
purportedly related to the currency deals which he said, 'show typographical
inconsistencies'.
The first document purports to show that on November 9 1990 MCC bought a
Dollars 242.5m (Pounds 170.7m) contract for settlement on March 28 1991,
three days before the end of MCC's financial year. This was followed by a
Dollars 279m contract on December 21 1990, and a Dollars 247m contract on
December 28 also for settlement on March 28.
The fourth document purports to show that on March 28 1991 MCC closed its
position by selling the Dollars 768.5m at a spot rate of Dollars 1.739,
supposedly generating the Pounds 37.9 profit. However, the Wall Street
investment bank purportedly involved in the transactions has told
investigators that it has no record of these transactions.
The Pounds 36.9m net profit from the currency transactions was supposedly
paid directly by the bank to one of Mr Maxwell's private companies which
allegedly then paid the money to MCC as part of a Pounds 40m cash transfer
received by MCC on April 4 1991. Administrators to the private companies
have confirmed that a Pounds 40m payment was made, but said it did not
represent the proceeds of foreign exchange transactions.
Last night, Mr Lee said: 'The documents could well have been cut and pasted
and as a result of this discovery we are now looking even more closely at
MCC's foreign exchange deals.' Price Waterhouse has provided details of its
investigations to the Serious Fraud Office.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Tate &amp; Lyle chief executive leaves after 11 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR STEPHEN Brown yesterday left Tate &amp; Lyle, the sugar and sweeteners group
where he was chief executive. Mr Brown joined the company only in April 1991
as group managing director. He became chief executive in April last year,
when Mr Neil Shaw split the roles of chairman and chief executive.
Tate also announced other board changes. The shares fell 3p to 434p.
Analysts said Mr Brown's sudden departure was embarrassing for Tate and for
Mr Shaw and raised questions about management succession at Tate.
Mr Brown's original appointment had suggested Tate could not find a
successor to Mr Shaw internally. Mr 'Red' Wilson, who had run the group's
North American businesses and had been seen as a possible successor, left in
1989, although he remains a non-executive director.
Mr Shaw said yesterday that he planned to stay for at least two years and
there would by then be 'a lot of candidates' to succeed him.
Mr Brown, who had a three-year rolling contract on a basic salary of around
Pounds 300,000, is expected to receive compensation of around Pounds
900,000. He will also have to move out of his Kensington home, which is 70
per cent-owned by Tate and 30 per cent by himself, or exercise an option to
buy Tate's share. The house was bought for Pounds 900,000 last June.
Mr Shaw said there had been differences over management style and Mr Brown
'didn't fit in'. There had been 'no big scene' but both sides agreed that it
'wasn't working'.
He said there was a difference between an agricultural company such as Tate
and a manufacturing group such as Alcan, the aluminium company, where Mr
Brown worked before.
He admitted that this had not been foreseen when Mr Brown was appointed two
years ago.
One analyst said Mr Brown 'never managed to impose himself'. Others
suggested that Mr Shaw had continued to dominate decisions.
However, insiders said that Mr Shaw had stepped back from day-to-day
management, taken on a number of outside interests and had 'played fair'.
They admitted there could have been some difference of perception between Mr
Shaw and Mr Brown over the role of a chief executive.

FT  02 MAR 93 / US price warriors spark revolution in desktop Japan: A
successful assault by American computer makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As the Japanese economy began the year showing signs of a worsening slump,
Dell Computer, the US company, announced its arrival in the second largest
personal computer market in the world.
Dell announced a low-priced desktop computer - a move that heralded a
revolution in the Japanese PC market's pricing structure and distribution
system.
Dell's debut in Japan has added momentum to a concerted assault on the
Japanese market by leading US manufacturers which has forced Japanese
computer companies to rethink their strategies.
Shortly after Dell arrived in Japan, Toshiba announced its first low-cost
notebook PC, bringing the price-cutting trend into the notebook market.
The Japanese PC market has long been one that seemed to work according to
its own rules.
The difficulty of producing software which used the Japanese language had
allowed a handful of domestic manufacturers, led by NEC, to carve up the PC
market among them.
While the rest of the world was dominated by IBM-compatible machines, in
Japan NEC ruled supreme with 53 per cent of the market, followed by Fujitsu
with 13 per cent and Toshiba with 11 per cent, according to the Nikkei
Industrial newspaper. IBM had to content itself with a meagre 7 per cent
market share. Until as recently as a few months ago, US PC manufacturers had
made little impact on the minds of the Japanese PC-buying public, but a
price war, triggered last autumn by Compaq, the US company, changed all
that.
On October 1, Compaq introduced a machine at half the price of comparable
Japanese-made PCs. IBM immediately followed suit by introducing its own
range of low-priced PCs.
This offensive sent a tremor through the Japanese PC industry. Most leading
Japanese PC manufacturers, including NEC, the market leader, cut their
prices within months. In return, Compaq reduced the price of some of its
machines further and added a three-year guarantee.
NEC's response has been mostly defiance. It insists that the outbreak of the
price wars has had no effect on its business. 'NEC will never compete in a
price war,' says Mr Katsuichi Tomita, general manager of NEC's personal
computers marketing division.
Yet NEC felt threatened enough to use nationwide advertising to spell out
that its own system could boast 14,500 software applications, 379 service
points throughout the country and proven experience with Japanese language
software.
In spite of NEC's tactics, the impact of the price wars has been to raise
substantially the profile of US manufacturers and improve their fortunes in
Japan. Undercutting the domestic competition on price proved to be the
quickest, most effective, route for outsiders trying to gain market share.
'We brought out low-priced models because it was the main way to
differentiate between IBM's and NEC's machines,' says Mr Tsutomu Maruyama,
director of personal systems operations at IBM's Japan General Business
Company.
IBM and Compaq both report strong sales.
The groundwork for the success of the price wars had been laid by IBM. In a
bid to spread the use of its own PC/AT standard, IBM had set up an Open
Architecture Developers' Group and invited foreign and domestic
manufacturers to support DOS-V, a bilingual operating system that allows
users to use the English language DOS, as well as more than 1,000 Japanese
applications.
Most of the leading manufacturers, apart from NEC and Apple, have joined the
IBM-led consortium.
Yet in spite of the momentum building up around DOS-V, the attempt by US
manufacturers to break NEC's dominance still faces formidable obstacles.
NEC controls national distribution channels. Two-thirds of PC sales in Japan
are still through specialist dealers which have traditionally sold NEC
machines. US manufacturers, which were late to enter the Japanese market,
will need to build up their distribution channels.
The DOS-V camp, with about 1,000 Japanese language software applications,
cannot compete with NEC's 14,500 applications. The willingness of developers
to write software for DOS-V depends on the penetration rate of hardware,
which in turn depends on the number of software programmes available.
For the huge installed base of NEC users, there is little incentive, apart
from price, to switch to DOS-V. But NEC has already closed the price gap by
introducing a low-priced range of its own. 'NEC already has a huge installed
base. Why would those people want to give up the security of using something
they are already familiar with?' asks Mr Katsushi Shiga, industry analyst at
Dataquest, the high technology consultancy.
There is also some question as to how far price alone can woo Japanese
consumers away from domestic manufacturers. Many in the industry believe
that in spite of the attraction of lower prices, discount superstore and
tele-marketing sales will not take off as strongly in Japan as in the US and
Europe. Japanese consumers, they say, would rather pay for having equipment
installed and serviced than having to do it themselves. 'There isn't much of
a do-it-yourself culture in Japan,' admits IBM's Mr Maruyama. 'Japanese
people don't have that kind of time.'
Unless US manufacturers can keep the price gap between their products and
those of domestic manufacturers wide, the momentum building up could quickly
fizzle out. The signs are that US manufacturers intend to keep up the heat.
And Japanese consumers are becoming more cost-conscious and more
sophisticated as familiarity with PCs spreads.
Apple Computer saw Japanese market revenues lift 50 per cent in the year to
September 1991 and 30 per cent in the past fiscal year.
The most likely outcome of the current price wars is that the large US
manufacturers will gain market share at the expense of smaller Japanese
players.
The chill wind of foreign competition has forced domestic manufacturers to
ask what consumers really want - high prices and free service, or choice.

FT  02 MAR 93 / GPA shares priced at Dollars 1 in latest issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA GROUP, the aircraft leasing company, is offering its shareholders the
right to buy shares at Dollars 1, compared with the Dollars 30 it said they
were worth less than a year ago. In an attempt to raise new funds, GPA has
set the conversion price of its Dollars 200m (Pounds 140m) preference share
issue at Dollars 1. The cash is needed to ensure the company's survival.
The price compares with Dollars 20 a share offered in the Irish-based
company's aborted flotation last June and the Dollars 30 a share it said
they were worth less than a year ago. Nomura International, the Japanese
securities house which is organising the new share issue, has told GPA's
shareholders that restructuring the Dollars 5.5bn of debts depends on
raising new equity.
Shareholders have been asked to give their response before the end of this
month, when the restructuring is due to be completed. One shareholder said:
'If we do not take part in this share issue, we have been told the banks
will take effective control of the company.'
It is the third time in less than a year GPA investors have been asked to
raise cash. The company was forced to pull a preference share issue, with a
conversion price of Dollars 8, at the end of last year following its failure
to go public in the summer.
Of the four big shareholders which account for 35 per cent of the group, Aer
Lingus, the Irish airline, is unlikely to take part. A spokesman said last
night that the airline was 'keeping the situation under close review. The
matter was discussed at last week's board meeting and no decision was made.'
Air Canada has not yet made a decision. Mitsubishi Trust and Banking
Corporation and Irish Life are understood to be inclined to take part,
although part of Irish Life's shareholding is made up of non-beneficial
trusts which may not take up the new shares. Other shareholders contacted
yesterday said they had yet to decide whether to take up the new shares.
GPA's banks have already make clear they will only agree to the
restructuring if shareholders take part in the new issue. The banks are
being asked to defer to late 1996 approximately Dollars 1bn of debt
repayments due between the end of last year and September 30.
The issue means a dilution of stakes owned by shareholders unable to take
part in the fund raising.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Owners rebuffs Airtours' final bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS Abroad yesterday rejected a raised final hostile offer from rival
holiday group, Airtours, which values the company at Pounds 268m.
Mr Howard Klein, the Owners Abroad chairman who was offered an increased
cash alternative by Airtours last week, said the new offer still undervalued
his company.
'The board believes the strategic alliance with Thomas Cook and LTU will
deliver far greater value to shareholders than Airtours' final offers,' said
Mr Klein. Thomas Cook and LTU, the German travel company are both controlled
by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank, which is still hoping to
create a pan-European holiday group with Owners Abroad.
The immediate reaction of some Owners Abroad shareholders was that Airtours'
new offer was not over-generous. One said it was 'touch and go' whether
Airtours would win at this level.
Airtours' increased all-share offer includes 15 Airtours shares for every 34
ordinary Owners shares. With Airtours shares up 3p at 309p last night, this
offer values Owners' shares at 136p, 2p above Owners' closing price.
Airtours also increased, and made final, its preference share offer, in
which it will give 218 convertible preference shares for every 100 Owners
Abroad convertible cumulative redeemable preference shares.
The company did not increase its partial cash alternatives. These are Pounds
67.94 and 19.41 Airtours ordinary shares for every 100 Owners Abroad shares,
and Pounds 122.08 in cash and 95.92 Airtours convertibles for every 100
Owners Abroad convertible shares.
Mr David Crossland said the final offer was fair both to shareholders in
Airtours and Owners Abroad, who had never before seen a price that high.
He said Airtours bookings continued to gain momentum and its market share
continued to be ahead of Owners Abroad's. Airtours is currently the number
three in the holiday tour market behind Owners Abroad, both of which are
less than half the size of market leader, Thomson.
Airtours also forecast a 1993 dividend of not less than 8.7p, a 20 per cent
increase.
Airtours offer is final, unless a 'competitive situation arises' from
another bidder.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Sterling boosted by prospect of lower German interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ and RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING enjoyed a powerful rally against the D-Mark yesterday amid strong
expectations in financial markets that Germany's official interest rates
would be lowered again after an interval of just four weeks.
European bond and equity markets also experienced rallies following comments
at the weekend by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, Bundesbank president, indicating
that he has taken a more relaxed attitude to further interest rate cuts.
However, Germany's latest inflation figure yesterday raised concern that the
Bundesbank might not be willing to ease its Lombard and discount rates at
its council meeting on Thursday, despite the deterioration in the German
economic outlook. Consumer price inflation rose to an annualised rate of 4.2
per cent in the year to February.
After falling to new historic lows against the German currency last week,
sterling yesterday rose 3 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in London
at DM2.37. In New York the pound was trading at DM2.3725 and closed against
the dollar at Dollars 1.439.
It also rose sharply when measured by its exchange rate index, which
expresses the pound's value against a basket of currencies. The pound closed
at 77.1 on the index from a previous close of 76.0.
The London stock market also surged to an all-time closing high, on hopes
that a cut in German interest rates would assist a further easing in UK
monetary policy. The FT-SE 100 index of leading shares closed 14.6 points up
on the day at 2,882.6.
European stock markets were buoyant on expectations of an easing in
Bundesbank policy.
In Paris, the CAC-40 share index gained 15.09 points on the day to end at
1,998.8. In Frankfurt, the 30-share DAX index gained 16.6 points to close at
1,700.95. German government bond prices rose half a point with 10-year bonds
yielding around 6.65 per cent yesterday evening.
After the weekend meeting in London of finance ministers of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations, Mr Schlesinger suggested that a reduction
in the minimum reserves which German banks have to hold in non-interest
bearing accounts at the Bundesbank should prompt a slight fall in German
money market rates.
New reserve requirements introduced yesterday triggered a sharp fall in the
cost of borrowing D-Marks overnight, from about 9 per cent to 8.78 per cent.
This raised speculation that the Bundesbank could lower its 'repo' rate  -
at which it provides wholesale funds to commercial banks - by as much as 15
basis points later this week from the current level of 8.5 per cent.
However, the operations of dealers in German money markets clearly implied
that they also expect a cut in the discount rate, currently at 8 per cent,
which sets the floor for German interest rates.
Mr David Cocker, chief economist at Chemical Bank in London, said the main
requirements of an easing in the discount rate were not in place. The German
government's solidarity pact had not been agreed and important wage
agreements with the country's trade unions had not yet been completed.

FT  02 MAR 93 / NY Trade Centre partly reopens after blast: Two-thirds of
workers estimated to be displaced following bomb
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT and KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICE WORKERS jostled with television crews and emergency services
yesterday as Manhattan's World Trade Centre partly reopened after Friday's
bomb blast which killed five people.
Mr Stanley Brezenoff, executive director of the Port Authority of New York
and New Jersey, which operates the complex, estimated that about two-thirds
of the 50,000 people who normally work there had been displaced.
He confirmed that it would be at least another week before the complex's
110-storey twin towers reopened, but said there was no fresh information on
who was responsible for the bomb. Police said about 55 calls claiming
responsibility had been received.
Many of the hundreds of financial firms based in the complex had used the
weekend to shift operations to other offices. Deloitte &amp; Touche, the
international accountancy firm which normally has 1,200 people working from
seven floors of One, World Trade Centre, one of the towers, said it was
temporarily housing them in its Broadway office.
Deloitte said it had been allowed into the towers on Sunday to retrieve
urgent files, and the only visible damage was from smoke. 'There's a fine
soot on the computer equipment, but we won't know whether that's affected
the hardware until we turn it on,' an official said.
Salomon Brothers, the big US investment bank based in Seven, World Trade
Centre, said yesterday it planned to convert one of its computer rooms into
a temporary trading floor for 200 'displaced' Cantor Fitzgerald employees.
Cantor Fitzgerald Securities, based in One, World Trade Centre, is the
largest interdealer bond broker.
Dean Witter Reynolds, the brokerage firm and largest single tenant of the
complex, said it had relocated 4,500 employees to six company offices in New
York and three more in New Jersey. It said its trading operations were
running normally.
US firms were not the only ones affected. Some subsidiaries of foreign
financial services firms based in the twin towers also faced disruption.
Commerzbank Capital Markets normally has about 50 people working out of One,
World Trade Centre. They were attempting to move across West Street, to the
bank's offices in the separate World Financial Centre complex.
New York's futures exchanges, which share a single trading floor at Four,
World Trade Centre, managed to open for abbreviated sessions yesterday, and
most hope for business as usual today.
However, the New York Mercantile Exchange, where most of the world's crude
oil is priced, is again planning delayed openings and early closes.
The New York Commodity Exchange operated in a make-shift environment, but
spirits were high on the trading floors. Traders particularly enjoyed the
fresh air being pumped onto the trading floor to compensate for lost air
conditioning.
The New York commodity exchanges provide the world's largest markets for
crude oil, coffee, sugar and cotton and are important trading centres for
precious metals such as gold and platinum. World prices for these
commodities are set in New York, making it essential that trading time is
not lost.
Meanwhile, early morning commuters to the WTC found transport running almost
normally. The Port Authority stressed that there had been no structural
damage to the twin towers.
New York state officials said a Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.5m) programme had been
set up to assist small and medium-sized businesses displaced as a result of
the blast. Mr Richard Leone, chairman of the Port Authority board, said:
'Obviously, we're suspending rent.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament to cost over Pounds 200m for the first time next
year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARLIAMENT is to cost the taxpayer more than Pounds 200m for the first time
next year, according to Treasury figures.
Revised figures, to be published next week, will show that the total cost of
the House of Commons and the House of Lords is Pounds 198m for 1992-93,
including ministers' salaries, and is estimated to be Pounds 210m in the
financial year beginning next month. This figure is based on cutting the
salary bill by Pounds 3m, in ways which have not yet been decided, so could
turn out to be higher.
While the government is cracking down on public spending in every
department, the parliamentary budget is one area over which ministers have
little control.
Treasury officials say the rise in the Commons budget for fees and salaries
from Pounds 58m last year to Pounds 72m this year comes partly from an MPs'
decision last summer to vote themselves a rise which took office costs
allowances for each of them to almost Pounds 40,000 - above annual salaries.
Spending on the House of Lords, including allowances for the 400 or so peers
who regularly attend, is planned to rise from Pounds 36m this year to Pounds
41m next year, while spending on House of Commons administration is set to
rise from Pounds 90m to Pounds 100m.
Comparisons with previous years are difficult, because until recently costs
such as printing or building work were concealed in other departments'
budgets.
But in 1979-80, the first year of the Thatcher government, the spending on
Commons fees and salaries was Pounds 12.5m, while in 1992-93 the comparable
figure is Pounds 72m - an increase of well over 450 per cent. Between 1979
and 1991, the retail price index rose by 136 per cent.
However, taxpayers may feel they are getting value for money, at least in
terms of effort; parliament sits for longer each year than many other
legislatures.

<TEXT>
All is not sweetness on Tate &amp; Lyle's board as Mr Stephen Brown's abrupt
departure as chief executive testifies. Mr Brown was only at the company for
two years. As the architect of Tate's recent success, the chairman, Mr Neil
Shaw, is well qualified to fill the breach. Nevertheless, the unhappy
episode raises questions about the board's judgment.
This year is not a worry: Tate should show reasonable recovery following
earlier disappointments. But Tate has yet to prove it has a longer-term
growth recipe for its portfolio of mature businesses. A new chief executive
would help find an answer.

FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The battle for Owners Abroad may turn out to be close, despite the increased
offer from Airtours. A company used to driving hard bargains with its
suppliers was unlikely to be over-generous to Owners' shareholders. Still,
an exit multiple of 11 looks thin. Airtours has a superior management record
and its offer represents a large premium to Owners' pre-bid share price. But
Owners has presented a good case for its proposed link-up with Thomas Cook.
Airtours has failed to quantify equivalent benefits for Owners' investors,
making the continued absence of a full cash alternative perplexing.
The failure to deliver a knock-out blow raises the possibility of Owners
coming under foreign parentage. Germany's WestLB bank, which controls Thomas
Cook, may seek to secure its investment or even launch an outright bid. That
would be a highly unusual move. But Owners' shareholders should not rush to
respond to Airtours just yet.

FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Repsol
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The timing of the Spanish government's international sale of up to Dollars
1bn of Repsol shares has more to do with deteriorating public finances than
choosing an opportune moment in the business cycle. Yesterday's full-year
figures maintained the company's record of earnings growth, but refining,
marketing and petrochemicals are all slowing. The extent of rationalisation
suggests the government's current 54 per cent stake has not been too much of
a restraint on management.
Since car ownership and the economy are forecast to grow faster than the
European average, Spain ought to be comfortable home turf. Yet with its home
market in recession and the government soon reduced to a minority, Repsol is
understandably considering expansion abroad. BP and Elf have started to
encroach on Spain. Exceptionally high refining and marketing margins cannot
last forever. Deregulation of the local butane market will produce wider
margins in the short run. It also brings the long-term threat of
competition.
Diversification could be achieved through asset swaps with other oil
companies. Repsol might surrender a portion of its local refining share in
return for a marketing toehold in France or the UK. If crude oil prices
start to rise, it will be harder to resist the temptation to acquire more
upstream assets to match downstream capacity. Either option carries a degree
of risk. Repsol has proved itself in a protected domestic energy market. The
risk is that it gets sucked into unwise expansion.

FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One begins to wonder why Sir James McKinnon is so determined to conduct the
debate about the future of British Gas in public. Traditionally,
participants respect the confidentiality of submissions to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission. But the director-general of Ofgas has aired his
views in the manner of someone who suspects that the argument is not going
his way. If Sir James is merely trying to apply extra pressure to ensure he
triumphs, then he is playing with fire.
Besides, the latest Ofgas document does not adequately address many of the
thorny issues raised by the break up of British Gas. Should the proposed
regional marketing companies have a local monopoly, and, if not, who should
assume the obligation to supply customers with gas? Will the government
accept that low-usage domestic customers should pay more? Does the cheap
interruptable gas market have a future, and is it economically efficient for
companies such as ICI to be supplied with gas at marginal prices?
Whether British Gas is dismembered or not, the most important factor for
valuing the company is the rate of return earned on its pipelines. Here the
gap between Ofgas's recommendations and British Gas's requests is still
vast. Privatisation has produced several poorly thought-out structures. Now
that gas is justifiably getting a second look, both customers and investors
deserve more than yet another half-baked publicity stunt.

FT  02 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Sterling takes a shine
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At last, things seem to be going more the chancellor's way. The Bundesbank
has hinted at lower interest rates to come; UK inflation appears under
control; after a further robust rise in M0 money supply, there is a whiff of
recovery in the air which makes Mr Lamont's reluctance to cut rates that bit
more credible. At least he should be spared a sterling crisis in the run up
to the budget. A stable pound as well as a competitive exchange rate is
needed to attract overseas buyers into the gilts market.
Sterling's 3.5 pfennig rise yesterday suggests the markets may be getting
ahead of themselves. There is no guarantee that the Bundesbank will cut
official rates that quickly. Long bond yields have fallen in Germany and
there has been some good news on the wages front, but retail price inflation
of 4.2 per cent, continuing high wage demands in the construction sector and
the unresolved budget negotiations give pause for thought. The Bundesbank
may confine itself for the time being to a further cut in the money market
repurchase rate.
Mr Lamont has a balancing act to perform at home. While the recovery remains
tentative, a tight budget would be difficult to sell in the absence of lower
interest rates. Without some sign of fiscal discipline, the markets might
come to doubt his ability to finance the PSBR. Since the government appears
to be concerned about the exchange rate, it could certainly do with some
timely accommodation from the Bundesbank.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Leading Article: John Birt Inc
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AVERAGE British citizen has long been entitled to take all possible
steps, provided they are legal, to minimise his or her tax bill. But the
director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation is not an average
citizen; and the revelation that Mr John Birt's pay has been finding its way
into the family coffers via a tax-efficient private company has
understandably raised eyebrows.
Yesterday's belated decision to turn him into an employee of the corporation
is undoubtedly the right one. But it leaves a disconcerting impression that,
just as long as the public remained in the dark, the BBC and its board of
governors were happy to live with an arrangement that did not stand up to
public scrutiny.
It was certainly a curious arrangement for any director-general of the BBC.
By calling himself a consultant and paying himself through a company, Mr
Birt was able to offset a wide range of expenses against his remuneration,
something which no ordinary employee is able to do. This is particularly
unsettling to BBC staff at a time when they are being asked to absorb the
effects of a programme of radical change initiated by Mr Birt.
Unlike most of those who are paid under contracts at the BBC, the
director-general enjoys several years of tenure. And unlike most television
producers who operate under a corporate banner, he does not derive his
income from a wide range of sources.
The arrangement was nonetheless agreed by the Inland Revenue and has been
sanctioned over many years. There is no way of knowing how widespread such
arrangements are in broadcasting or any other business.
The fact that a tax avoidance mechanism is legal does not necessarily make
it acceptable for individuals in important positions to exploit it. This
point has force whether the individual is in the private or public sectors,
although those who hold high public offices have a responsibility to accept
demanding standards.
But more reliable information is needed before it can be judged whether it
would be appropriate to take an early opportunity to tackle the specific
loophole which permitted Mr Birt's arrangements. There are good arguments
for reviewing the whole structure of corporation tax to address this and
other concerns, but not only on the basis of tax avoidance by a few
television personalities.
The main policy matter to arise from the affair is a reminder that the
pursuit of a simple tax system which is widely felt to be fair requires
constant vigilance and determination. The fall in personal income tax rates
under the Thatcher governments did much to undermine many of the more
Byzantine tax avoidance methods, but there is still work to be done.
For the BBC, the main issue is the question mark raised, once again, over
the judgment of the board of governors. But they seem no more likely than
others in British public life to accept responsibility for an evident
blunder.

Bulls of the gold price may be an endangered species, but they were out in

Rupert, doyen of South African industrialists, led the celebrations.
His belief in the yellow metal is no surprise given that his Rembrandt
tobacco business has big stakes in Gold Fields. Still, his view that the
world has too little gold is at least novel. 'It is so scarce,' he says,
'that all the gold mined since Noah could be fitted into one luxury yacht
such as that of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.' No doubt Rupert is talking from
first-hand experience.

If anyone doubted Robert Drummond, chairman of the British Venture Capital
Association, when he said back in January that one of the biggest challenges
facing venture capitalists was raising new funds, they should have been
watching the final episode of BBC2's Adventurers programme.
The series, based on Drummond's own venture capital firm, Grosvenor Venture
Managers, revealed that Grosvenor set out in early 1992 to raise Pounds 60m.
It was forced progressively to reduce its sights until, by the end of the
series, it had gathered in only Pounds 7m. On top of this, the two young
turks who joined the firm at the start of the series were both quitting.
Clearly Drummond has not got the same sort of star qualities as TV
Troubleshooter Sir John Harvey-Jones who comes from the same TV production
stable. But it would be a great pity if Drummond's experience deterred
others from revealing warts and all on camera.

Given the fanfare accompanying Jose Dedeurwaerder's arrival at the top of
Interbrew, the fast-growing Belgian beer giant, his sudden decision to quit
is mystifying.
The Belgian brewer of expensive Stella Artos lager had hired the former
Renault car troubleshooter to consolidate the merger of privately-owned
Piedboeuf and Artois, and to expand the company internationally. The simple
explanation is that he has completed that job, and successfully. But some
suspect he may have trodden on toes on the way - all too easy for the
professional manager of a family-owned concern.
The vacancy will be filled temporarily by Jean-Marie Descarpentries, on the
board for two years and better known as the former boss of French packaging
company Carnaud. He engineered the merger with Metal Box - and reduced his
audience to glassy-eyed bemusement with a two-hour philosophical
justification of it.

When it comes to finding well-paid retirement jobs for ex-British
ambassadors to Japan, demand seems to exceed supply, judging by the speed
with which Sir John Whitehead has been picking up jobs lately.
However, it seems that there may also be an untapped demand for retired
Japanese big-wigs. Shijuro Ogata, former deputy governor of the Japan
Development Bank, is on Barclays' board, but there are precious few other
examples.
Full marks then to Foreign &amp; Colonial which has recruited Kazuo Chiba,
Japan's man at the Court of St James until 1991, on to the board of its Far
Eastern flagship Foreign &amp; Colonial Pacific Investment Trust. Chiba, with
his impeccable English and considerable cultural versatility, was a big
success in London.
F&amp;C's Eric Elstob says he got the idea of recruiting Chiba after he 'popped
up this winter giving a seminar at the LSE in Far East international
relations'. The fact that Chiba will be sitting alongside Sir Hugh Cortazzi,
Britain's man in Tokyo between 1980 and 1984, may have helped. Even so F&amp;C
seems to be living up to its pioneering reputation.

Hands up anyone who hasn't yet formed a pro-manufacturing industry lobby
group? After the lost years of the 1980s, during which British business
apparently forgot how to make anything except Japanese cars, manufacturing
is firmly back on top of the agenda.
The CBI, finally bludgeoned into championing the makers of nuts and bolts
after its love affair with the service sector, has its National
Manufacturing Council, businessman David Turnbull has started the UK
Industrial Group, and now an odd bunch of politicians is launching the
Manufacturing and Construction Industries Alliance.
It's the brainwave of maverick Tory MP Nicholas Winterton. He's got Robin
Cook, the Labour industry spokesman, GMB boss John Edmonds, the Lord Mayor
of London and a bevy of industrialists from Rolls-Royce downwards on his
side.
Indeed, the only weakness is Winterton himself. He doesn't have the ear of
the PM, to put it politely, and he and his new chums can be rather full of
themselves sometimes. Even so, the presence of veteran campaigner Des Wilson
suggests that the new alliance will get heard. But why another organisation
whose motto 'Making things happen' sounds no different from the CBI's
'Making it in Britain'?
It seems Winterton had initially tried to cuddle up to the CBI without
success. Nevertheless, all sides are being very polite and the CBI's Howard
Davies has even sent a message of support.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Exposed to chill economic winds: French banks are beginning
another bruising year in their domestic markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you ask Mr Andre Levy-Lang, chairman of Paribas, the French banking
group, how his company is faring, the answer is scarcely cheering. 'We had a
tough time in 1992,' he said, 'and 1993 is going to be another difficult
year.'
Mr Levy-Lang is not alone. The 1992 figures for Paribas and the other big
French banks, due to be published over the next few weeks, will paint an
unpleasant picture of sluggish operating profits from their banking
activities and steep provisions against losses on property and industrial
investments.
The French banks, which include six of Europe's 20 biggest banks, are now
beginning another bruising year of struggling with both the short-term
pressures of the economic slowdown and the long-term challenge of adapting
to life in an increasingly competitive market. The problems could not have
come at a worse time for Credit Lyonnais and Banque Nationale de Paris
(BNP), the state-controlled banks which are prime candidates for
privatisation if, as the opinion polls suggest, France's conservative
coalition wins this month's parliamentary elections.
One of the main difficulties is the sluggish state of the banks' domestic
market. The high level of French real interest rates, at more than 7 per
cent, has depressed demand for credit among consumers and industry. 'Demand
for credit is static for the first time since the war,' said Mr Michel
Pebereau, chairman of Credit Commercial de France. 'This means that the
volume of banking activity is very low.'
The credit problem has also made it difficult for the banks to respond to
the recent rise in short-term interest rates triggered by the Bank of France
in its battles to defend the franc. The bank raised its short-term lending
facility, which sets the rate at which banks borrow money, from 10 per cent
to 12 per cent in early January. The action was aimed at deterring
speculation, by making it more expensive to borrow funds in francs.
This increase also raised the banks' borrowing costs. In normal conditions
they would have responded by raising the base rate they charge for loans to
their own customers. But they have been reluctant to do so, partly for fear
of offending the government, which is anxious to avoid another interest rate
rise before the elections, and partly because of concern that higher base
rates would further depress demand for credit.
The big banks have left base rates at 10 per cent since December. The French
banking association estimates that, since the short-term facility rose in
early January, their total borrowing costs have risen by FFr10m (Pounds
1.25m) a day. The Bank of France is committed to reducing short-term rates,
but is unlikely to make substantial cuts until German rates fall further,
for fear of imperilling the franc. The banks have been left in the
unenviable position of having to decide whether to struggle on with higher
borrowing costs, or to risk losing business by raising base rates.
These problems have been aggravated by the fragile state of the property
market, particularly in Paris where average rentals have fallen by 20 per
cent over the past three years. Mr Levy-Lang estimates that the banking
industry may have to write off up to FFr70bn on property loans.
Banks have also been hit by the plight of small companies. The number of
business failures - mostly small concerns - rose by 7.3 per cent in the year
to last August, leaving the banks with a string of bad debts.
As a result, the four largest commercial banks - BNP, Credit Lyonnais, CCF
and Societe Generale - have seen their average level of provisions as a
percentage of average loans treble from 0.4 per cent in 1989 to 1.2 per cent
in the first half of last year. While this level may be relatively high for
French banks, however, it is low by international standards. The comparable
figure for the four big UK banks in 1992 was 2 per cent. Moreover, French
bankers argue that higher provisions, like the credit squeeze, are due to
short-term factors.
'We've been through all this before in the mid-1970s and early 1980s,' said
Mr Marc Vienot, chairman of Societe Generale. 'The property crisis, business
failures and the market slowdown are all cyclical problems which will be
resolved when the economy picks up.'
So far, there is no sign of a pick-up. The latest Bank of France survey
suggests the economy has deteriorated in the opening months of this year,
largely because of the effect of the strong franc on exports. Economists
expect the strains to continue until after the elections, with the recovery
starting in the second half of the year.
'The worst is probably over,' said Mr Chris Davis, banking analyst at BZW in
London. 'The cyclical pressures should have eased by the end of this year
and the banks must then address their main structural problem  - the high
cost of their branch networks.'
French banking overheads are high by international standards, with a
cost-to-revenue ratio of 70 per cent, against 65 per cent in the UK. The
banks are trying to resolve this by shedding staff, which represents 60 per
cent of costs. The French banking association estimates that the industry,
which employs 430,000 people, is now reducing staffing at an annual rate of
2.3 per cent, against an average of 1 per cent for the past four years.
The banks are also responding to domestic pressures by expanding outside
France. The industry has traditionally taken a cautious approach to
international investment, with the exceptions of Paribas in capital markets
and Credit Lyonnais with its successful European commercial banking network.
However, last month CCF joined forces with Germany's BHF Bank to take
control of Charterhouse, the UK merchant bank, and BNP declared an interest
in buying Banco de Fomento of Spain.
The most pressing question on the domestic agenda is whether the banking
industry's present problems will jeopardise the conservatives' plans to
privatise BNP and Credit Lyonnais. Both state banks have been badly affected
by the economic slowdown. BNP, which has adopted the more cautious strategy
of the two, saw net profits fall from FFr2.94bn in 1991, to about FFr2.78bn
in 1992, and is on course for a modest recovery to FFr3.2bn this year,
according to Shearson Lehman, the investment bank.
Credit Lyonnais is in a more precarious position. It barely broke even in
the first half of 1992 and analysts forecast a fall in net profits from
FFr3.2bn in 1991 to less than FFr1bn last year. The crux of its problems is
the aggressive lending policy, pursued since Mr Jean-Yves Haberer became
chairman in 1988, which has left it exposed to a string of corporate
catastrophes, including Dollars 350m to Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian
property group, and Dollars 900m to MGM, the stricken US film studio. The
bank is also worried by speculation that its MGM exposure is far higher than
its Dollars 900m estimate.
'Could you privatise Credit Lyonnais right now? No way,' said one observer.
'And I wouldn't try selling BNP on last year's figures.' However, analysts
are confident that both banks should be marketable in two or three years.
The most discussed scenario is that Mr Haberer will be replaced at Credit
Lyonnais after the elections and BNP will liven up its image with deals such
as Banco de Fomento.
'This certainly isn't the right time to sell either BNP or Credit Lyonnais,'
said a second observer. 'But there's no reason why they shouldn't be sold in
late 1994 or 1995. The whole French banking system should look a lot
healthier by then. If there are no more disasters, Credit Lyonnais might
even look like an exciting investment - exciting in the right way.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / World Bank's worst-kept secrets: Michael Holman argues for
an open approach in Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The time has come for the World Bank to open to public scrutiny its
relationships with the governments of Africa, just as it has urged the
continent's leaders to open up to their citizens. Transparency and good
governance demand it.
Instead the bank withholds information. Country reports, sectoral analyses
and project evaluations are classified as confidential. Often they are the
only source of reliable data in Africa, but bank officials apart, only a
handful of politicians and civil servants is allowed access to them. This
restrictive approach does Africa a disservice - it stifles debate, protects
vested interests and gives structural adjustment programmes a bad name.
Many governments around the world would like to control the information
supply, but in Africa it is easier to do so than elsewhere. The private
sector is weak, the press is vulnerable, universities starved of resources,
think-tanks are almost non-existent. Who can fill the information gap if
governments will not? Only the bank.
It already plays an important part. Its 1989 analysis - Sub-Saharan Africa:
From Crisis to Sustainable Growth - remains required reading. Hardly a month
goes by without a new study on some aspect of the continent's economic
crisis. But it is a different matter when it comes to operations in
individual countries.
The bank's relationships with some of its African clients are profoundly
unhealthy: protective, secretive or defensive, sometimes all three.
Governments are too often being given the benefit of the doubt when practice
falls short of promise, and presidents' white elephants are indulged.
Take Nigeria: why the circumspection with which the bank handles its biggest
customer in Africa? The bank has been the main supporter of the structural
adjustment programme launched by President Ibrahim Babangida in 1986. After
a promising start the programme ran into serious difficulties, undermined by
corruption, weak management and fading political commitment.
But these factors are not evident from a look at the bank's 1992 annual
report on the state of black Africa's largest economy. 'Growth in Nigeria's
GDP and agricultural sectors,' it says, 'both rose by about 5 per cent in
1991 with total non-oil productions rising by just under 4 per cent. However
the combined effect of the political transition and the short-lived effect
of the Gulf crisis contributed to some weakening of fiscal and monetary
discipline' (my italics).
This euphemism conceals a crisis. The unexpurgated view of Nigeria is
revealed in a bank report - Public Expenditure Management in Nigeria - not
intended for public consumption. It was based on a review conducted in early
1991. In this study, one finds a more enlightening account of Nigeria.
The report tells of 'large-scale' spending of oil revenues 'outside the
purview of statutory controls'. It speaks of 'a lack of transparency and
accountability of big spending decisions'. It says that 'public expenditures
(are) used more to distribute oil riches and generate lucrative business
opportunities for selected groups than to ensure efficient delivery of goods
and services to the country as a whole'.
Ask Nigerians about their economic crisis and most will blame corruption and
'sap' - the acronym for the structural adjustment programme, which has
become synonymous with hardship, inflation and unemployment. But if they had
access to information that the World Bank treats as confidential, they would
be better able to see the link between corruption and mismanagement and the
failure of 'sap'. They would gain more insight into Nigeria's plight, and
why 'sap' was introduced in the first place. This information would not ease
the pain of austerity. But at least there would be a better understanding of
why 'sap' was not working and a more informed debate about alternative
strategies.
Of course, the bank has an explanation for the secrecy. Without it,
officials argue, governments would not co-operate. And confidentiality is
clearly important. Yet all too often information that should be in the
public domain remains secret. When information about grave mismanagement is
withheld, confidentiality overlaps with complicity.
It is now widely accepted that international aid should carry conditions,
whether linked to human rights or political accountability. The World Bank
should add access to information to that list. The reports and analyses on
which adjustment programmes are based should be open to public scrutiny.
Nigeria, which has promised to return to the path of reform, would be a good
place to start. Chief Ernest Shonekan, chairman of the country's governing
Interim Council, set out the blueprint in his budget in January, together
with an appeal for debt relief. Few actions would do more to convince
sceptical donors and creditors that he means business than allowing the
World Bank to open the books on Nigeria. The governments that object the
loudest to such scrutiny would be those with the most to hide.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Breaking up British Gas
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS a strong prima facie case for some form of break-up of British Gas,
and the current Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation provides an
opportunity to do so. Whether the radical dismemberment proposed yesterday
by Ofgas is the right way to go remains unproven.
The underlying principle behind the industry regulator's plan is right:
competition wherever possible, and monopoly and regulation only where
necessary. Ofgas convincingly argues that British Gas's transportation
business is the only part of the gas supply market to constitute a 'natural
monopoly'. It would be wasteful to build duplicate pipelines into customers'
premises and, provided rivals can get fair access to these facilities, there
is no reason why the rest of the gas market should not be competitive.
But is forcing British Gas to sell off 14 different companies necessary to
achieve competition?
The case for creating a separate transportation company is compelling. The
current integrated structure has made it difficult for competitors to get
fair access to British Gas's pipelines. Divestment would ensure fair
treatment, as the transportation business would no longer have an incentive
to show favouritism to British Gas's marketing arm.
There is also something to be said for breaking the marketing business into
12 competing companies. A more modest proposal would be to remove British
Gas's de jure monopoly to supply domestic customers. But the group's de
facto monopoly would be eroded more quickly if it was split into regional
companies able to make raids into each others' territories.
More competition would create a greater incentive to improve efficiency,
expand the market for gas and deliver a better quality of service. The main
objection is political. Competition might lead to prices for some customers
going up as cross-subsidies inherent in the system were eliminated.
The least convincing part of Ofgas's plan concerns a separate gas purchasing
company. British Gas's dominant position in this part of the market is
largely due to long-term contracts signed before privatisation. It is
already being forced to sell on some of this gas to competitors and it is
not clear that more should be done.
Moreover, most of Ofgas's arguments are theoretical. Before embarking on big
structural changes to the industry, it is important that hard figures on the
costs and benefits of a break-up are produced. So far the only published
figures are a Pounds 3bn estimate from British Gas and a Pounds 250m one
from Ofgas for the break-up costs. No attempt has been made to explain where
these numbers come from, although the MMC has been given more detailed
figures. British Gas and Ofgas must now make more financial information
available to the public. The issue is too important to be decided behind
closed doors.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Russia's backyard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE political and economic situation in Russia worsens, the responses of
President Boris Yeltsin grow more unpredictable. Already struggling to
maintain his political authority at home, he has now touched off alarm bells
abroad with careless talk concerning Russia's role in its immediate
neighbourhood. In a speech to the centrist Civic Union grouping on Sunday,
Mr Yeltsin said that given its 'heartfelt interest' in suppressing conflicts
around its borders, Russia should be granted 'special powers' by the United
Nations to act as guarantor of peace and stability in the former Soviet
Union.
It is not clear whether even Mr Yeltsin knows what precisely he has in mind.
But if - as Russia's wary neighbours and former subjects were bound to
suspect - he is demanding some sort of international carte blanche to
intervene beyond his country's borders, either in defence of Russian
interests or in the more general cause of containing instability, he
deserves a dusty response from the west. If he is attempting to appease
hardliners in his armed forces by promising them a new extra-territorial
role, then he is playing a dangerous game which, far from creating a 'belt
of good-neighbourly, friendly states' around Russia as he says he wants,
could merely fan the flames of conflict.
Russia undoubtedly has an overriding interest in preventing the spread of
conflict to its south and west: its troops are already in combat in Georgia
and Tajikistan, and keeping a fragile peace in Moldova; refugees from these
wars represent a further burden on its resources; and fissiparous tendencies
abroad could easily infect the Russian federation itself.
It also has reasons for concern about the internal arrangements of some of
its peers in the Commonwealth of Independent States. Some 25m ethnic
Russians live in other parts of the former Soviet Union, and in some cases -
Latvia, Kazakhstan and eastern Ukraine - they constitute nearly half the
population. Such communities are a target for anti-Russian sentiment at a
time when relations between governments are coming under increasing strain
over energy prices, currency links and trade. In Latvia and Estonia,
discrimination against Russian minorities represents a flash-point waiting
to ignite.
But to acknowledge such interests is one thing; to give Russia a free hand
in dealing with them unilaterally quite another. In some of the conflicts on
its borders, Russia could conceivably play a useful mediating role. But in
many of them, its status as honest broker is not undisputed - and is likely
to be further tarnished if it arrogates to itself an open-ended right to
intervene in other sovereign states.
The west should tell Russia that it can only hope to resolve such disputes,
and take its place in the community of civilised nations, by playing the
fullest role in the international body set up to deal with them, the UN.
Attempts to bypass that machinery will only make matters worse.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Personal View: The beauty of a vote - Reform of bankruptcy
law could help revive ailing companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPE AGHION, OLIVER HART and JOHN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On both sides of the Atlan-tic, a debate is taking place about bankruptcy
law. There is a lot at stake. When a company needlessly goes to the wall,
the overall health of the economy is threatened - to say nothing of lost
jobs and wrecked lives.
Bankruptcy law should play an important role in resuscitating financially
distressed companies that are inherently sound. But current procedures are
failing to deliver. A recent Coopers &amp; Lybrand report concludes that,
despite reforms in 1986, UK insolvency procedures too often 'bayonet the
wounded'. In the US, Chapter 11 is thought to be slow, costly and too soft
on debtors.
Practitioners have suggested ways of amending current procedures. While many
of these changes are sensible, there are more fundamental problems that no
amount of tinkering will solve. A radical restructuring of bankruptcy law is
needed. We propose a new procedure, which is simple and quick, and gets the
balance between liquidation and reorganisation right.
Almost all existing procedures can be crudely classified into two types. In
the first type, a bankrupt company's assets are sold off for cash, and the
proceeds distributed to creditors according to the seniority of claims. This
type of procedure - in essence a cash auction - is how Chapter 7 operates in
the US, and how most liquidations and receiverships work in the UK.
Cash auctions are attractively simple. The worry is that they lead to the
piecemeal liquidation of healthy companies. Of course, in principle, there
is nothing to stop someone from making a cash bid for the company as a going
concern. The problem is that it is costly to buy the whole of a large
company for cash. So even viable companies may be broken up.
To overcome the danger of inefficient liquidation, a second type of
procedure has been developed. In the UK, this is the administration order;
in the US, it is Chapter 11. Although the details of the UK and US
procedures are very different, both can be viewed as forms of structured
bargaining. The idea is to encourage creditors to agree on a reorganisation
plan for the company, including a restructuring of their claims. Crucially,
a plan can be agreed by a suitable majority of the creditors: unanimity is
not required. Creditors may of course decide to liquidate, and this is how
most cases end up.
Reorganisation is a laudable objective, but there is an inherent problem
with structured bargaining procedures. Creditors are being asked to make two
decisions. First, what should happen to the company - should it be
reorganised or liquidated? Second, who should get what - whose debt should
be forgiven, and by how much?
Serious conflicts of interest arise when these two matters are decided
together. Senior creditors may push for rapid liquidation since they will
certainly get paid. Junior creditors and shareholders may want to gamble on
the reorganisation process, since they enjoy the upside gains if the
company's prospects improve, but do not suffer the downside losses. In
structured bargaining, people are not only squabbling over how to divide the
cake, they are also fighting over which cake to divide. This mixing of
decisions is a recipe for failure.
We propose a procedure that has the simplicity of a cash auction, but which
is flexible enough to allow for reorganisation, without conflicts of
interest. At the outset of bankruptcy, an insolvent company's debts are
cancelled. The accountant or judge supervising the process then solicits
bids for the company. The crucial difference from a cash auction is that
bidders can offer to buy the company using as means of payment securities in
the post-bankruptcy company.
Suppose the company's managers believe that the bankruptcy was owing to bad
luck rather than their bad management. They want to continue running the
company, but do not have the cash to buy it outright. Under our proposal,
they could bid to retain their jobs by offering equity in the
post-bankruptcy company.
Another possibility would be to make a bid comprising cash and equity, where
the cash is raised by borrowing against the company's future profits. An
outside management team could make the same kinds of bids. And of course
anyone is free to make a purely cash bid.
The difficulty in evaluating these various bids is that they are chalk and
cheese. How does one compare a cash bid to a non-cash bid? The answer is to
transform the former claim-holders into shareholders, and then let them vote
on the bids. There are a number of ways of doing this.
One market-based mechanism gives all the equity initially to senior
creditors. Junior creditors have the right to buy out the senior creditors
once the bids are announced: someone owning 1 per cent of the junior debt is
given the option to buy 1 per cent of the equity from the senior creditors
at a price equal to 1 per cent of the senior debt. Similarly, former
shareholders are given the option to buy back the equity from the creditors
as a whole.
The merit of this scheme is that it preserves the seniority of claims
without requiring an external valuation of the company. No junior claimant
need feel short-changed, since he or she can always buy out the senior
claimants if he or she thinks their equity allocation is worth more than
what they are owed.
Once the new shareholders have been determined, they vote on which bid to
accept. If the vote goes in favour of a cash bid, the company is in effect
liquidated or sold. If a non-cash bid wins, then the company is in effect
reorganised.
The advantage of a vote is that it leaves the decision over the company's
future - whether to liquidate or reorganise - in the hands of the (new)
owners. And at the moment of decision, these owners' interests are aligned,
since they are all shareholders. Moreover, there is no squabbling over the
division of the company's value, since the procedure determines this
mechanically via the options.
We think our procedure strikes the right balance between liquidation and
reorganisation.
Unlike a cash auction, the procedure gives claim-holders the option of
maintaining the company as a going concern if the company's bad fortunes are
the result of bad luck rather than bad management.
Unlike administration or Chapter 11, the procedure avoids conflicts of
interest. It is quick and cheap. And it is not biased in favour of incumbent
management. Managers must persuade the new shareholders to vote them back
into office, presumably against a competing cash bid. The threat of losing
one's job provides a strong incentive to avoid bankruptcy.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: Why Mulroney's effect on society means he will not

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN MCNAMARA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While it may seem mean-spirited, I think that you will find that most
of your Irish readers would object to your characterisation of Brian
Mulroney ('Irish charm turns sour on Mulroney', February 25) as an 'Irish
charmer'.
Look at it this way: while you would perhaps be comfortable attributing a
stereotypically British characteristic - for instance, a 'stiff upper lip' -
to a politician of British origin, you would think again before headlining
Jesse Jackson's or Nelson Mandela's 'sense of rhythm'.
Innocent as it may seem, your Irish charmer label is in fact a stereotype,
with more negative images, such as the usual 'tendency towards exaggeration'
(which was included in the same article), never far away.

   From Mr NICHOLAS LOWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The resignation of Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister of Canada, has
garnered a fair share of attention. However, I feel the focus of the
commentary has failed to highlight the true reason for the demise of Mr
Mulroney's leadership career.
While it is true to say that his tenure suffered from the blight of economic
recession in Canada, other issues are more central to his unpopularity. Mr
Mulroney, like many other politicians, failed to heed the history of his
nation and the protestations of the citizenry.
Mr Mulroney's greatest error was his transgression on the citizens' ideal of
the nation of Canada. He fostered and supported policies that attacked the
institutions of the national political and social identity. These ranged
from simple incidents such as the controversy over the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police uniform, to the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords.
One must realise that being a Canadian means more than playing hockey and
objecting to being called an American. There are intangible aspects that few
Canadians can define, but they are all too aware of them when they are
vio-lated.
A national identity does exist in the hearts and minds of every Canadian,
which is built up from the aspects of the Canadian social structure and
lifestyle.
In the final analysis, Brian Mulroney showed too much petulant disdain for
that which the man in the street holds dear, and his fate was predictable.
Therein lies the true reason for his fall from grace.

   From Dr HAROON AKRAM-LODHI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'Mr Mulroney's political legacy' (February 25) suggests
that history will be kind to Brian Mulroney. However, the view from Main
Street is very different from the view from Southwark Bridge in London.
Mr Mulroney pursued policies designed to restructure the Canadian economy.
The results have been: an erosion of the east-west trade which has
historically served as the foundation of Canada's economic logic; a
decimation of the Canadian manufacturing sector; a loss of tens of thousands
of jobs, many of which have shifted south to the US; and the longest,
deepest recession recorded since the 1930s.
By undermining the social solidarity upon which the Canadian federal state
is built, these policies have been instrumental in worsening Canada's
divisions, not only between French and English-speaking Canadians, but also
between eastern and western Canadians.
Mr Mulroney will not be missed.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: The Duke of Westminster 'should have read Marx'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LUCA SALICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Duke of Westminster seems genuinely surprised at the Conservative
government's desire to interfere in property rights with the lease reform
bill currently before Parliament.
The Conservatives are clearly trying to remove some power and wealth from
the large London estates in favour of the professional middle classes that
live in West End flats.
This is a case of redistribution of wealth from the very rich to the merely
rich.
Had the Duke of Westminster read his Karl Marx as a young man like everybody
else, he would have realised that the shifting of the balance of power
between social classes is what politics is all about.
Politicians of all persuasions endeavour to protect or extend the power of
some social classes at the detriment of others.
Had the Duke realised that, he might have adopted the well-known policy of
diversifying one's investments.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: Politicians ignore national identity at their own
peril
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS LOWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The resignation of Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister of Canada, has
garnered a fair share of attention. However, I feel the focus of the
commentary has failed to highlight the true reason for the demise of Mr
Mulroney's leadership career.
While it is true to say that his tenure suffered from the blight of economic
recession, other issues are more central to his unpopularity. Mr Mulroney,
like many politicians, failed to heed the history of his nation and the
protestations of the citizenry.
His greatest error was his transgression on the citizens' ideal of the
nation of Canada. He fostered and supported policies that attacked the
institutions of the national political and social identity, from simple
incidents such as the controversy over Royal Canadian Mounted Police
uniform, to the Meech Lake and Charlottetown Accords.
One must realise that being a Canadian is more than playing hockey and
objecting to being called an American. There are intangible aspects that few
Canadians can define, but they are all too aware of when violated.
A national identity does exist in the hearts and minds of every Canadian,
which is built up from the aspects of the Canadian social structure and
lifestyle.
Brian Mulroney showed too much petulant disdain for that which the man in
the street holds dear, and his fate was predictable. Therein lies the true
reasons for his fall from grace.

FT  02 MAR 93 / A colour-blind vision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Police chiefs everywhere will recognise the powerful phrases used by Mr Paul
Condon, the new commissioner of London's metropolitan police, at the
weekend. 'The dire consequences of racially based nationalism, ignorance,
prejudice and outright thuggery,' he said, 'have already been seen to a
greater or lesser extent in Italy, in France, in Belgium and of course in
Germany.' He did not exclude his own country. 'Our society is in the process
of becoming an even richer mix of races and nationalities,' he reminded his
audience at a three-day conference on 'fairness, community and justice',
organised by the Metropolitan police.
His clear implication was that 'outright thuggery' is used against Asians,
Africans and West Indians in Britain. We all know this. England's assaults
on Indians and Pakistanis long preceded Germany's recent murderous attacks
upon Turkish guest-workers. On the western side of the English channel, the
perpetrators are usually young louts, but sometimes police constables. 'This
is an area where we must be totally intolerant - intolerant of racially
motivated attacks, intolerant of those who indulge in racial abuse, and
intolerant of those who use hatred and violence as the tools of their
political expression,' said the commissioner.
As to the police themselves, 'we must be equally intolerant of our own
colleagues who fail to meet the required standards. The argument that there
is some excuse for poor behaviour because the culture of the service can
only be expected to mirror that of wider society . . . is simply specious.'
Mr Condon's words echo the warnings given to the Los Angeles police by Mr
Willie L Williams, the black successor to Mr Daryl F Gates as chief in LA.
In saying this, I acknowledge the substantial differences between Scotland
Yard and LA law. Blacks constitute a far greater proportion of the Los
Angeles population. The ugly beating by four white officers of the black
motorist, Rodney G King, on March 3 1991, and the subsequent riots in Watts
county, caused much more damage in California than anything that has
happened in Britain. The burned-out acres of Watts are evidence of that, as
I saw the other day. Yet the fears in both cities are the same.
The British theory of assaults on ethnic minorities is that the less said
about them the better. The Commission for Racial Equality has so far failed
to persuade the government to create a new offence of racial violence. The
government does collect figures showing reported attacks. But, although
these suggest that there have been sharp increases over recent years, the
actual numbers are meaningless, since black or brown victims often believe
that there is no point telling the police. Worse, there is plenty of
anecdotal evidence to suggest that some younger members of the force
automatically assume that the non-white participant in any fight is the
aggressor, no matter who started it.
My exposure to such stories started a few months ago with a telephone call
from the CRE. It proposed a new set of annual media awards, for sensitive
reporting or interpretation of racial matters. Would I be one of the judges
in the radio section? A few weeks later 32 tapes arrived - a total of 22
listening hours. Heavens] The only solution was to keep them for the
motorway.
What I thought would be a bore turned out to be fascinating. The Britain
revealed by these tapes is every bit as multi-ethnic as Mr Condon says it
is. Non-whites constitute only 5 per cent of the population but a
disproportionate number of them are under 16. These young new Britons may be
visible in the streets, but many are indistinguishable to the ear. The
really interesting voices were exactly those of natives of these isles. On
one tape a Chinese girl spoke with a pure Ulster accent; on another we had a
Glaswegian Singh; on a third a Patel of the Welsh valleys. West Indians who
speak undiluted Birmingham are well-known; I heard a few as I sped along the
M4.
Some of those interviewed, such as Diane Abbott, Labour MP for Hackney North
(Harrow County grammar school and Newnham College, Cambridge), have clearly
been able to look after themselves; many have not. Accounts of racial
harrassment, by pavement thugs or by the very police officers to whom the
incidents were reported, were too consistent to be ignored. There is a
contrary argument. Some forces have officers whose duty it is to record
complaints of racial abuse, and to follow these up. The good intentions are
there, but one or two individuals in a large and busy force cannot plod
through the huge volume of reported incidents of violence.
None of the above should be taken by contestants as an indication of which
tape has won. That is a separate matter, to be decided at the CRE ceremony
at the end of the month. The point this morning is that Britain's ethnic
community speaks to the rest of us through many hours of air-time. What it
says fully justifies Mr Condon's weekend observations. These might serve to
increase the propensity of victims to report racial incidents.
Beyond that, it is hard to see what can be done. British race relations are
governed by a tacit agreement between the government and the majority of the
electorate that remains suspicious of foreigners in general and black or
brown ones in particular. The deal is this: whichever party is in
government, and whichever the official opposition, will combine to enact an
increasingly severe series of laws aimed at keeping non-whites out.
The latest example, debated in the House of Lords last month, is the Asylum
and Immigration Appeals bill. On February 16, Lord Bonham-Carter observed
that 'there is racial discrimination in the way in which the system works at
present; and that will become worse if there is no appeals procedure', as
there will not be under the new legislation. 'I should be surprised,' he
added, 'if the more than one-in-1,000 Americans who were refused . . . entry
 -as opposed to the one-in-five Ghanaians and one-in-27 Jamaicans - were not
black.'
In return for this restrictive covenant, the native inhabitants of the white
homeland of Britain are expected to treat the few Africans, Asians and West
Indians in their midst with a degree of decency. Most do. Mr Condon's is the
right approach to those who do not.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: A Welsh perspective on the freight transport debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From A J GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In his article 'Little Engine Who Can't' (February 15th), Richard
Tomkins makes a valuable contribution to the debate on road and rail as
regards freight traffic.
His analysis of the issues is certainly borne out in south Wales, where
there has been a dramatic decline in rail freight traffic consequent upon
the collapse of the coal industry and the rundown in the steel industry,
both of which were virtually captive markets for the railways.
It is of course true that the government and various other agencies have had
considerable success in diversifying the economy of the area through inward
investment and indigenous growth of manufacturing. But for the reasons given
in Mr Tomkins' article, this has done little or nothing to halt the decline
in the amount of freight carried by rail.
I believe that a fresh approach is needed. The government is now more
committed than for a long time to promoting transport infrastructure
developments.
In these circumstances I suggest that it should commission a detailed study
into the viability of establishing between a dozen or 20 railway-motorway
interchanges with the most modern handling equipment, so that anything from
a parcel to a full container load could easily be switched from one form of
transport to the other.
I am convinced that if all the important industries within, say, a 20-mile
radius of such an interchange were satisfied that freight deposited there
between 4pm and 8pm one day would be available for collection at the nearest
destination interchange between 6am and 10am the next morning, a good deal
of long-haul traffic would be switched.
The truth of the matter is that most of our transport infrastructure is
related to an economic structure which no longer exists or which has been
transformed beyond recognition and over the years has 'grown like Topsy'
with little or no regard to an overall strategic plan.
The time has come for a fresh start. While we cannot wipe the slate clean,
we should at least take steps to ensure that future infrastructure
developments are coherent and meet the needs of the next century and not
continue to be related to those of an earlier one.
A study along the lines I suggest would be an important step in the right
direction.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN MCNAMARA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While it may seem mean-spirited, I think you will find that most of
your Irish readers would object to your characterisation of Brian Mulroney
('Irish charm turns sour on Mulroney', February 25) as an 'Irish charmer'.
Look at it this way - while you would perhaps be comfortable attributing a
stereotypically British characteristic (for instance, 'stiff upper lip') to
a politician of British origin, you would think again before headlining
Jesse Jackson's or Nelson Mandela's 'sense of rhythm'.
Innocent as it may seem, your Irish charmer label is in fact a stereotype,
with more negative images, such as the usual 'tendency towards exaggeration'
(which was included in the same article), never far away.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Letter: Housing bill and Britain's constitution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GEORGE DONATH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, My regard for the Conservative Party is much enhanced by its steadfast
pursuit of the Housing Bill, albeit in a somewhat emasculated form, and
notwithstanding the loss of the Duke of Westminster's support.
The Duke wishes to use Britain's unwritten constitution as an impediment to
change. It is in fact the opposite, for it permits parliament to update
legislation in an orderly fashion, while restricting upheaval to the
legislative chamber.
The Grosvenors have a litigious record in both the British and the European
courts.
One would hope that the present Duke will not now set out to try to
frustrate parliament's will by either further attacking the principle or
searching for loopholes in the legislation.
This can only create bitterness, expense, a modicum of delay and further
legislation.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: Dmitri Hvorostovsky - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The noisy enthusiasm which greeted this recital suggests that Dmitri
Hvorostovsky is well on his way to becoming a fully-fledged matinee idol.
With arms outstretched and head held high, a smile of audacious pride
allowed to creep across his face as he polishes off another song to his own
satisfaction, Hvorostovsky is clearly practised at how to play the part.
For the young Russian baritone who rocketed into public awareness when he
won the BBC Cardiff Singer of the World competition in 1989 fame was won
quickly. He has, however, worked in earnest to further his standing. His
matinee recital at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Sunday was no mere
after-lunch selection of favourite titbits from the celebrity singer's
sweet-trolley. This was a serious programme of Russian song at its most
demanding.
The first half was all Tchaikovsky. By chance the audience included the
Russian mezzo Olga Borodina (in London to sing Berlioz's La Damnation de
Faust at the Royal Opera) whose Tchaikovsky recital at the Edinburgh
Festival last year was so unforgettable. Comparisons are difficult to
resist: if Borodina was the more determined to get to the heart of each
song, Hvorostovsky was also musically eloquent, dramatically varied.
Occasionally there were odd phrases in these songs where the baritone's
instrumental shaping of the vocal line recalled old recordings of bel canto
singers of the past. But when he sings out, especially at the top, the voice
does not grow in size and brilliance as one might expect. The top notes at
the end of 'Be it day that reigns', with the singer proudly inviting
applause and Mikhail Arkadiev thunderously coming close to drowning him at
the piano, suggested both of them thought that he was making more noise than
he really was.
The pleasure of the recital came not in the thrill of hearing a fine voice
in full flood, as Hvorostovsky might suppose, but in the beauty of so much
of the singing, its malleability, its sensitivity to colour. Of the
Tchaikovsky songs, 'Amid the din of the ball' stood out for its
conversational intimacy and 'On yellow cornfields', a marvellous song, for
its feeling of intensity with room to spare. Musorgsky's Songs and Dances of
Death were not monochrome sepulchral black, as they were with Christoff and
Nesterenko, but subtly contrasted studies of Russian gloom.
Encores included a pair of arie antiche and Bellini's I Puritani, suavely
sung, the breath control as remarkable as ever. By that point it was no
doubt a sensible idea to vary the programme, but it is Hvorostovsky's
accomplishment as an imaginative and serious interpreter of Russian song
that will stay in the memory. Now that so many young Russian singers are
coming forward who fully have the measure of this repertoire, there is no
excuse for audiences in the West to ignore it.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: The Magic Fundoshi - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This triptych of short Japanese plays were written in Kyogen style by Donald
Richie, the British authority on Japanese film, during his 50 years in
Japan. Kyogen drama, as Richie has written, is 'satyr-play, anti-masque; it
is Pyramus and Thisbe to Noh's Theseus and Hippolyta.' And all three of
these are miniature comedies in nicely bawdy vein. Perfect Servants is like
an erotic joke by Marivaux; The Magic Fundoshi is like a dirty rewrite of
The Emperor's New Clothes; and The Misplaced Goddess is like a Whitehall
farce set in a temple.
They are, however, acted here with laborious cuteness and zero finesse. I am
sure that Glen Goei and Stephen Night, who co-direct, know far more about
Japan than I; but this, surely, is Japan for tourists. David Tse, Adrian
Pang, Danile York and Andrew Mallett perform with an archness that implies
that (a) 'We're being Japanese, and refined, and quaint' (b) 'You couldn't
take any of this seriously, it's too silly' (c) 'But aren't we a hoot'.
Everything smacked of schoolboy theatricals. I think I laughed once, but
have forgotten when. Not when the Lady Chibusa (Mallett) reads Hello
magazine, anyway.
Acted with more authority, these plays could probably be enchanting. (Alas,
there is always an audience to cherish crummy nudge-nudge acting, and the
audience at Hammersmith's Lyric Studio chortles merrily.) Richie has a comic
gift, which only falters in the climax of The Misplaced Goddess. The real
goddess appears, and tells off these men for underestimating women - an
apotheosis evidently intended as a feminist dea ex machina idea. But its
feminism is expressed with such pc deadness that it seems to have been
written by a machina for a machina, with no serious dea or idea in its head.
At the Lyric Studio, Hammersmith, W6, until March 20

Last week's Assignment reported on malaria in countries such as Cambodia and
Thailand, and showed that the disease was killing 20 times as many as Aids,
yet receiving much less research money. This week's programme quotes what it
calls 'Asia's leading Aids prevention campaigner' saying that Aids is
'Asia's largest non-military security threat'. It seems that Aids spreads
through Thai brothels and 95 per cent of Thai men are said to use the
brothels (7.45 BBC2). We progressed from de Quincey to Aldous Huxley in last
week's survey of artists and drugs in Without Walls. Today (9.00 C4) we move
on to the 1960s and such characters as Ken Kesey, Timothy Leary and JG
Ballard. 40 Minutes finds nine young men from north-east England packed into
a Benidorm flat intended for four. 'Loud, aggressive, abusive, they drink
too much and leer at the topless girls', we are told. 'It looks like an orgy
of loutish behaviour but, for them, the excesses are an escape from the
drabness of life in everyday Britain'. Surprising really that they are not
all mass murderers given the unique horror of the drabness (9.50 BBC2).

FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: Horizontal slice of European art / A look back to the
works of 1893 at the Musee d'Orsay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chronological study of a movement's development, or the retrospective
account of a particular artist and his work, is the staple of art-historical
museum practice. But there are other ways to slice it for the microscope
than up and down. The Musee d'Orsay has been looking sideways more and more
in recent years, and now, after the success of its contextual studies of Van
Gogh and then of Munch in their Paris periods, it has made the horizontal
slice much thinner and chosen to see what artists of all kinds throughout
Europe were up to in a single year.
The single-year idea is not new - I can remember a modest but excellent show
at the Tate in the mid 1970s, of works in the collections made in 1935 - but
this is the first I can think of to attempt so ambitious, pan-European a
view. As such it can hardly fail to be interesting and enjoyable to anyone
of open mind and catholic tastes. Here, cheek by jowl, sit great works
alongside manifest oddities, the familiar with the unfamiliar or unjustly
forgotten, different views and approaches to the same subject, the different
results to be had from similar practice.
A full century ago, 1893, is as good a year as any to settle on, with
Europe, fin de siecle, at its most cosmopolitan. And if Paris remained at
the heart of things, we have for once a French exhibition that does admit of
a significant world beyond. The sectional titles set out the possibilities -
inspiring places; daylight; primitivisms; science and poetry; intimism and
modernity; myths, religions, allegories; muses, nymphs and shepherdesses;
crowds, processions, solitudes; artists, writers, musicians.
Every section springs its surprises and pleasures. Here are Prince Eugen
(Sweden), with a barn-like castle beneath a wide northern sky, and DeGouve
de Nuncques (Belgium), whose strangely lit pink house is a clear
anticipation of Magritte, with a row of Monet's Rouen facades across the
room. Here are towering cliffs by Mednyanszky (Hungary); a mystical sunset
by Sohlberg (Norway); trees on breezy hill-top by Thoma (Germany). Tea, for
Casas (Spain), is taken in pregnant silence on the verandah; for Guthrie
(Scotland), with gossip in the garden; Kroyer's young lady (Denmark) sits
quietly reading beneath the rose bush.
We are given two magnificent Gauguins, a self-portrait and 'Otahi', a small
but monumental image of a crouching Tahitian girl. And alongside are a
Breton girl lying in the sun, by Amiet (Switzerland); a seated Breton girl
in blue-striped shawl by the excellent Roderic O'Connor (Ireland); and a
quite extraordinary, abstracted painting of Van Gogh's funeral, three broad
bands of colour, yellow, purple-black and pink, and a row of orange heads
above the pew, by Emile Bernard.
So it goes on, the influence accepted and remodelled, the intuitive
sympathy, the unlooked-for correspondence - Burne-Jones's strange grey
painting (England) of Perseus stealing, while they slept, the single eye of
the Graiae, sisters of the Gorgons; Malczewski's spirit of the whirlwind in
the cornfield; Masek's prophetess Libusa (Austria); Moreau's apocalyptic
Moses saved from the water. The point of the strength and continuing
importance of symbolism throughout the period, too often over-looked in the
modernist preoccupation with post-impressionism, is well made.
The academic tradition, vivified by current impressionist example, is also
well represented, most especially in the portraits and conversation pieces -
Breitner's tall girl before the mirror (Hollland); Rusinol's piano lesson
(Spain) with Renoir's two young girls at the piano; Corinth's vigorous, cool
portrait of the painter Leistikow (Germany); Rothenstein's of the painter
Conder, turning to leave the room (England); Serov's of the painter Levitan
(Russia); the artist's wife splendid in her scarlet dress by Anders Zorn
(Sweden).
But most remarkable, perhaps, is the Italian contribution with its technical
debt to Pissarro and pointilism, its conscious social realism and over-lay
of symbolism and its clear fore-shadowing of the Italian avant-garde, Balla
and Boccioni some ten years on. Here are Morbelli's old men in the bleak
hospice, and his rice-pickers bent double in the fields; Nomellini's workers
at a factory gate; and Pollizza da Volpeda's religious procession in the
summer sunshine, at once poignant, memorable and technically advanced.
The show ends with the proto-expressionism of Munch (Norway) and Ensor
(Belgium) and a genuflection to Cezanne. There is also the mandatory
audio-visual display, usually so resistible but this the most charming I
have ever seen: an anthology of rare cinematic vignettes of the period, made
by the Lumiere brothers in the streets of all the capitals of Europe.
But interesting as it is, the show is not an unqualified success. With
barely 90 exhibits, it is small enough, which is no bad thing; the Orsay
space for special shows is constrictive and ill-designed in any case. But
such portmanteau shows do hold out the promise of a generous and
comprehensive presentation, and here the promise is not truly delivered. The
omissions are all too clear, where comparatively few additions, 20 or so,
would have more than done the trick. Perhaps the loans were asked for and
denied. Yet surely there could have been a Whistler and a Sargent, not say a
Degas. And, from a British point of view, why so poor and trivial a Sickert,
why no Steer, no Nicholson, no Clausen, no Stanhope Forbes . . .

FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: 'The Juliet Letters' - Elvis Costello and the Brodsky
Quartet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'This is no more my stab at 'classical music' than it is the Brodsky
Quartet's first rock and roll album' warns Elvis Costello in the sleeve
notes to The Juliet Letters. The release of the disc, and the performance at
Drury Lane on Sunday, are the latest stage in Costello's carefully
calculated move away from the rock background of his earlier work and
towards something (not 'that junkyard named 'Cross-Over' he insists) that he
clearly hopes will prove to be richer and stranger.
With sublime hindsight hints of growing disaffection with the direction of
his career could be traced through Costello's last two albums, Spike and
Mighty Like a Rose. But neither of those patchy collections contains
anything to anticipate The Juliet Letters, in which he seems to have
abandoned almost every shred of his past work and started again from
scratch, working with the members of the Brodsky Quartet on a sequence of
songs for which the writing credits are shared equally.
The intentions may have been honourable enough, but the result is hugely
disappointing; in submerging himself in this collectivity Costello seems to
have sacrificed almost all his creative identity as a songwriter. There are
just flashes that reveal the distinctive tang of his best work, an
occasional twist to a vocal line or a familiarl modulation, but the hard
acerbic edge to the songs has all but gone; the rhythms of the lyrics are
flatter, less abrasive, and the emotional power has been drastically dimmed.
The textures of a string quartet marry uneasily with Costello's voice; there
are songs in the set in which the accompaniment would undoubtedly be far
more effective on a guitar-based band, while at best the string figures
simply blur the melodic shapes. Promoting the Brodsky from a perfectly
decent string quartet into creators in their own right has really added
little; the accompaniments and interludes which the players invent for The
Juliet Letters simply paraphrase choice nuggets of their mainstream
repertoire - a Bartok pastiche here, some Shostakovich or Britten tags
there. It is not surprising there is little sense of coherence, while
hearing some of their words put into Costello's mouth only reminds one of
the power his own lyrics regularly generate.
In live performance, with a sound very faithfully duplicating the recording,
the anodyne effect of the songs was if anything emphasised. Costello sings
them well enough, standing among the quartet to underline the blamelessly
democratic basis of the exercise. No one could deny the finest British
singer-songwriter of his generation has not earnt the right to experiment,
to explore new directions; it is the extent of Costello's failure here that
is so surprising; the huge sense of disappointment that is hard to accept.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Arts: Festival of Britten - London concerts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Barbican's latest big concert series (February 25 - March 21) is a
celebration of Benjamin Britten by the London Symphony Orchestra and a whole
galaxy of singers, choirs, instrumentalists and composers, led by Mstislav
Rostropovich. He is its artistic director and guiding light; he is
conducting most of the concerts, playing the cello in two others, and
infusing everyone and everything with his overflowingly generous musical
personality.
This is, above all, his tribute to Britten, the last of the 'three composers
who have had the most influence in shaping my musical life': thus he writes
in a foreword to the LSO programme book, itself decked with photographs
documenting the association of Britten, Pears, Rostropovich and Vishnevskaya
 -relatively short in clock-time (not quite two decades), infinitely
significant in creative terms.
But while the festival may focus on the artistic stimulus - of composer on
cellist (and soprano wife) and vice versa - that resulted from this
association, its programme is by no means narrowly single-minded. The LSO's
opening concert, last Thursday, had no Britten in it but much
Britten-by-reflection. The opening item was his little-known 1941
arrangement of the 'flowers' movement from the Mahler Third Symphony; the
finale was Shostakovich's Fourteenth Symphony, dedicated to him.
Mahler as Britten influence and Shostakovich as Britten's 20th-century
artistic companion-in-arms are potent, fascinating subjects that cropped up
again for examination in Sunday's two Barbican Hall concerts  - the
afternoon Borodin Quartet recital (which showed both Britten and
Shostakovich learning the metier of string-quartet composition) and the
evening LSO concert (which ended with Britten's 1939 Sinfonia da Requiem,
its anguish and consolatory calm deeply imbued with the spirit of Mahler's
Ninth Symphony). This intelligent artistic cross-referencing adds to the
excitement of the whole enterprise.
Another strand concerns Britten as enlightened patron of younger composers
such as Robert Saxton, Oliver Knussen and Colin Matthews. All three are
featured during the series; for Thursday's concert the LSO had commissioned
Matthews's Memorial. This sombrely impressive single-movement threnody
attempts to capture in music a war-vision something like Lutyens's 'great
untriumphal arch' at Thiepval, commemorating the fallen of the Somme (where
Matthews's grandfather is buried).
A single pedal-note tolls in the bass throughout the 20-minute length. Above
it, reflections of two of Britten's most impassioned musical war-protests,
the Sinfonia da Requiem and the War Requiem, seem to play on Matthews's
harmonic language and the carefully graded evolution of his orchestral
writing from grim chordal stasis to hallucinatory fast flourishes. The
concentration on rhythmic variety-in-unity that has preoccuppied so much of
his recent orchestral composition - fast-moving, exuberantly punchy - here
works up a powerfully intense effect of slowly unfolding lamentation,
dignified yet forcefully disquieted.
On Sunday evening, alongside the Sinfonia da Requiem, there was another
Britten composition presaging war: the Piano Concerto, a bittersweet
cocktail of Shostakovich raucousness, Prokofiev-like virtuoso glitter and
wit, and Britten's own angular, quintessentially English lyricism. It was
expertly mixed and shaken by the pianist Barry Douglas and the vast
batteries of the LSO.
As a Britten conductor Rostropovich responds with an uninhibited fervour
that nevertheless proves apt only some of the time. He gave the Simple
Symphony so fiercely loving and drawn-out a bear-hug that its 'Sentimental
Saraband' all but collapsed under the strain; the slow sections of the
Sinfonia da Requiem were likewise distended. Even then, however, while
longing for a lighter touch and a sharper sense of half-lights and
expressively glancing orchestral effects, one tends to find oneself disarmed
by his all-embracing Britten enthusiasm.( The festival is supported by
Britten-Pears Foundation and Britten Estate.)
*****
Earlier on the opening evening of the festival there was real Britten to be
heard, though only for a select number of the audience. In the intimate
setting of St. Giles Cripplegate students of the Guildhall School of Music
presented Curlew River, the first of Britten's three Church Parables.
Even when they are encountered straight after work and at a church in the
very centre of a city, far from the hallowed rustic silence that the
composer had in mind, these remarkable pieces cast a unique spell. Curlew
River, a Japanese Noh play transferred to the misty fenland of East Anglia
and given a Christian slant, is probably the best of them. Its music is
spare, infinitely sensitive to the touch; its atmosphere is haunting.
Various student groups have tried their hands at the Church Parables over
the years, but the Guildhall's production, in the care of Jonathan Alver,
came closest to the exaggerated Noh-style gestures of the original. The
vocal parts, including Mark Milhofer's plangent Madwoman and Mark Evans's
sturdy Traveller, were without exception well taken. Every good festival has
its fringe activities and the success of this one reflected well on the main
programme.

FT  02 MAR 93 / People: St Thomas' Matthews defeats Guy's Griffiths
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A battle between two of Britain's most prominent hospital managers to run
the biggest National Health Service trust in London ended in victory
yesterday for Tim Matthews, chief executive of St Thomas' hospital.
St Thomas' and Guy's hospital trusts are due to amalgamate into a single
trust next month. The eventual aim, based on recommendations of the
Tomlinson report into London healthcare, is to combine the hospitals on one
site.
Matthews (left) defeated Peter Griffiths (right), chief executive of Guy's,
for the new job. The decision is a severe blow for Griffiths, who gave up
the high-flying post of deputy chief executive of the NHS management
executive in Whitehall to run Guy's when it became a trust in 1991. It is
also a blow for Guy's morale - the hospital has frequently been promoted as
the flagship of the government's health reforms and a prototype for other
trusts.
Lord Hayhoe, who will chair the new combined trust, said yesterday that Tim
Matthews' leadership would provide an opportunity to build 'the best
hospital in London for patients, staff, teaching and research'.
Matthews first task, after getting his senior management team in place this
month, will be to develop a strategy for combining St Thomas' and Guy's. The
government wants proposals for consolidating services on a single site
within six months. It has not yet been decided which location will be
chosen.
Griffiths, 48, who is expected to leave Guy's soon after the new trust comes
into effect next month, said yesterday that he would 'continue to provide
the maximum support' in preparing for its launch. 'I have no doubt that
working together Guy's and St Thomas' will be a world beating combination,'
he said.
Matthews, 41, was previously district general manager of Maidstone health
authority and manager of the Middlesex hospital. Before that he, like
Griffiths, worked in the Department of Health.

<TEXT>
John Lovering, Sears' finance director until mid-1992 who resigned from the
retailing group at the end of January, has arrived at Tarmac, the UK
construction and building materials group which is expected to announce
substantial losses for the past financial year. In the newly-created
position of chief operating officer, he will be working in harness with
Neville Simms, chief executive, and Terry Mason, Tarmac's finance director.
Simms said yesterday: 'Tarmac is a very large group and I see us working as
a triumvirate. John Lovering will assist me with day-to-day operational
management and with business planning and development.'
Lovering joined Sears in 1986, becoming finance director in 1988. Last year
he was moved to the post of managing director of corporate development and
international operations. Sears chairman Geoffrey Maitland Smith commented
at the time of Lovering's departure: 'He felt his talents were not being
utilised.'
Before joining Sears, he held senior posts at Lex Service, Grand
Metropolitan and Imperial Group.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Software ruling - Legal Briefs
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A test case for the copyright of computer software, the English High
Court has ruled that a plaintiff can establish an infringement without
showing that his software code has been literally copied.
The case is of great significance to software developers and owners.
Previously, the law had been unclear in cases where 'the look and feel' of
one program duplicated another, according to solicitors Dibb Lupton
Broomhead, who acted for John Richardson Computers, the successful
plaintiff.
The Court said that non-literal aspects of a computer program could infringe
copyright. The plaintiff did not have to show copying of a substantial part
of the structure and organisation of the program even where the program
source code had not been copied.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: A good life at the top of the charts -
Robert Rice unveils the results of an FT poll of legal firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Clifford Chance, the UK's largest law practice, has emerged as the leading
UK commercial law firm in the 1992 FT law firm poll of polls.
The group's move to the top of the table, ahead of Linklaters &amp; Paines and
Slaughter and May, both of which were ahead of it in 1991, suggests it is
now reaping the rewards of the ambitious 1987 merger between Clifford Turner
and Coward Chance which led to its formation.
The overall strength and depth of the firm's base is reflected in its high
ratings across the complete range of performance indicators used in the FT
poll. Profitability remains the only area where it lags behind its main
competitors, its weak showing in Legal Business magazine's table of the most
profitable law firms being largely due to extraordinary costs associated
with a move to new City premises.
Although perhaps not yet enjoying the reputation of Linklaters and
Slaughters, it appears to be 'benefiting from a more competitive pricing
policy' than some of its rivals, according to one City observer.
Linklaters, ranked second, also had an exceptionally good year being
involved in most of the big transactional deals during 1992 and continuing
to benefit from the strength of its international capital markets work. The
firm would have finished as a clear leader but for its lack of involvement
in the main management buy-outs of 1992.
The 1992 poll also confirms the existence of a 'super group' first
identified in 1991. These top five firms continued to move ahead in 1992 in
spite of the depth of the recession largely through the strength of their
international practices and their domestic, corporate and financial client
base, which allowed them to tighten their grip on high quality, high value
work.
Mr James Wyness, joint senior partner of Linklaters, says 1992 was a year in
which to be grateful for a strong corporate and financial client base, a
view echoed by Mr Giles Henderson the new senior partner of Slaughter and
May.
In terms of the domestic market for legal services, 1992 was very tough and
increasingly competitive. For the big firms this meant concentrating more on
tailoring their services to client needs and learning to be flexible on
fees.
Companies began to recognise in increasing numbers that the recession had
changed the marketplace and that they could now exert a much greater
influence on the legal services they purchased and on what those services
cost.
In spite of the recognition by most law firms of the need to be flexible
over fees in these market conditions, the top UK commercial practices were
caught off balance in the autumn by a league table published by the
International Financial Law Review which suggested that the average hourly
rate for legal advice from a partner in a leading City of London law firm
had risen by 20 per cent in the last 12 months.
IFLR labelled UK commercial law firms the most expensive in the world,
charging Dollars 235 an hour more than their US counterparts. If, in
practice, they had demonstrated the need to be flexible on fees, they had
failed to get that message across to the public. Some firms had even found
themselves attacked for apparent inflexibility.
In spite of difficult market conditions, the top 10 firms all appear to have
enjoyed a relatively successful year. Figures published last September by
Legal Business for the 1991/92 financial year showed revenues holding up
very well in the early part of the year.
The top six firms all had turnovers roughly equivalent to Pounds 1m per
partner. Clifford Chance the UK's largest law firm had a turnover of Pounds
244m, comparing well with American firms of similar size such as Skadden
Arps (Pounds 280m), Baker &amp; McKenzie (Pounds 273m) and Jones Day (Pounds
232m). Linklaters (Pounds 154m), Freshfields (Pounds 135m), Lovell White
Durrant (Pounds 120m), Slaughter and May (Pounds 113m) and Allen &amp; Overy
(Pounds 112m) also compare favourably with their US counterparts.
All of them say that since April they have managed to maintain revenues and
that, if anything, business has picked up. The 1992-93 figures are likely to
show continued growth for these six.
The explanation for this success can be found partly in the counter-cyclical
nature of some sectors of the legal services market and partly in the
strength of the firms' international practices.
Mr John Pritchard, editor-in-chief of Legal Business magazine, says that all
the leading firms have benefited from the huge increase in corporate
restructuring and refinancing that has accompanied the recession. But two
firms in particular, Allen &amp; Overy and Lovell White Durrant, have shone out,
he says.
Mr Bill Tudor John, managing partner of Allen &amp; Overy says his firm has had
a particularly good year because of the strength of its banking and
insolvency practice.
Allen &amp; Overy had a hand in most of the big insolvencies and debt
reschedulings in 1992, acting for the administrators of the Maxwell private
companies and Canary Wharf and for WPP, Guinness Peat Aviation, Heron
Corporation and News International in their reschedulings.
On the international front, Linklaters, Allen &amp; Overy, Slaughter and May,
Clifford Chance and Freshfields have all benefited from their domination of
international capital markets and structured finance work.
The IFLR Eurobonds league table used in the poll of polls is supported by a
recent survey, by Euromoney, of senior executives in the Eurobond syndicated
loan and derivatives departments of leading financial institutions. That
showed that international capital markets are dominated by Clifford Chance
and Linklaters with Allen &amp; Overy and Slaughter and May vying for third
place.
With some 40 per cent of its work now having an international element, it is
not surprising that Linklaters and other such firms have found it easier
than most to ride the UK recession, Mr Wyness says.
To add insult to injury for those firms fighting for a share of the domestic
markets, what little high quality transactional work there was in 1992 also
appears to have gravitated to the top firms.
Freshfields, arguably the leading corporate finance law firm, Linklaters and
Clifford Chance were all involved in either the Pounds 3.7bn Hongkong and
Shanghai/Midland Bank deal or the merger between Reed International and
Dutch publisher Elsevier. Linklaters and Slaughter and May were involved in
the public sale of Wellcome shares and Linklaters worked all last year on
the ICI demerger.
This domination is likely to continue in 1993. Linklaters, for example, has
been appointed by the government on both the British Rail privatisation and
on the sale of the third tranche of British Telecom.
The picture for those outside the top 10 is not so encouraging. While the UK
economy remains in recession, all law firms are likely to suffer to an
extent. But it is outside the top 10 that structural problems, born of the
boom in legal business during the late 1980s when many law firms grew much
too rapidly in size to meet the huge demand for legal services, are likely
to make themselves felt in 1993.

Firms score 20 points for a first place and 0 where there are 20 firms
ranked above them in a league table. The FT's table of the top 10 law
firms is based on a poll of polls - from a number of publicly
available lists and rankings. The polls used in 1992 vary slightly from
those used in 1991 to take account of newly published information, in
particular the Legal Business table of the most profitable law firms.
The 1992 table also attempts to reflect the increasing importance of
international work by ranking firms by the size of their international
practice.

FT  02 MAR 93 / People: 'CBI activist' for new environment panel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Confederation of British Industry has set up a new environmental
lobbying panel and chosen Harry Robinson, a divisional director of John
Mowlem Construction, as its first chairman.
The Environment Protection Panel, which replaces a series of panels
concerned with individual issues, is designed to 'sharpen the thrust' of the
CBI's lobbying effort, according to environment director John Cridland. It
held its first meeting on February 4.
Robinson, 63, whom Cridland describes as 'a CBI activist', had for the past
two years been chairman of the South-Western Regional Council. He has spent
30 years at John Mowlem, and until last year was chairman of the South West
Division of the construction group. He remains a divisional director, with
special responsibilities including the corporate image; he also says he
'gets involved with major projects in the early stages'.
Cridland explains that the CBI had been particularly keen to involve someone
from the construction industry, rather than a representative from the
'classic polluters' such as chemicals or plastics. 'Land contamination for
instance is very hot on the political agenda,' says Cridland. 'We are all
more concerned than we were - and rightly so - about environmental
liability, but the CBI is keen to encourage the setting of effective rules
for the future rather than dwelling on the past.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: When to use the national courts -
European Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRICK COURT CHAMBERS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission has published new guidelines on co-operation with
national courts in EC competition cases, designed to encourage the use of
national courts in the application and enforcement of EC competition rules.
Publication of the guidelines in a Commission Notice has been hastened by
three recent developments: the post-Maastricht philosophy of subsidiarity;
the European Court's judgment in the Delimitis case setting out the
procedures which national courts may follow in EC competition cases; and the
recent Court of First Instance judgment in the Automec case. The Commission
relied on that case to justify exercising a discretion as to which
competition complaints it should give priority.
Since 1974, the ECJ has recognised that companies and individuals have the
right to enforce the EC competition rules in national courts. A line of
cases has established the general right to an effective remedy for
infringements of Community law.
The Commission Notice rather timidly says that this means that all
procedural rights and remedies such as damages, injunctions and interim
measures provided by national law should be available to litigants on the
same conditions as would apply if a comparable breach of national law were
involved. The Commission does not deal with the situation where there is no
effective remedy for a comparable breach.
National courts, however, have been reluctant to exercise their jurisdiction
for a number of reasons, such as the Commission's exclusive competence to
grant exemptions for agreements and business conduct which would otherwise
be prohibited as anti-competitive, the often complex economic questions
involved, and the absence of specific procedural rules. The Notice sets out
to provide sufficient reassurance to overcome this reluctance.
When applying EC competition law, national courts should be guided by formal
Commission exemption decisions, as well as any other official statements
such as comfort letters, the case law of the ECJ, other Commission
decisions, general notices and the block exemption regulations.
In difficult cases the national court is encouraged to stay proceedings to
await the outcome of any Commission procedure relating to the same conduct,
or seek the Commission's views on certain issues, or refer the matter to the
ECJ for a preliminary ruling.
It is envisaged that national courts may, within the limits of national
procedural law, request the Commission to provide:
information of a procedural nature;
consultation on points of law, including an interim opinion on eligibility
for individual exemption;
and factual data to be used as evidence by the parties subject to
availability and the principle of confidentiality.
Replies from the Commission on these points will neither bind the courts nor
affect their right to refer questions to the ECJ. The right to request
economic market data from the Commission is one of the most obvious benefits
of the Notice.
Although bringing an action before a national court may be more expensive
than filing a complaint with the Commission, the Commission identifies some
of the advantages of court action:
damages are available; injunctions may be available and interim measures may
be more readily adopted;
claims under national and Community law can be combined;
and legal costs may be awarded.
In spite of such potential benefits, however, the policy of encouraging
co-operation raises almost as many potential problems as it seeks to solve.
Effective decentralisation may demand a more radical approach along the
lines of harmonisation.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Technology: Steamed up over irons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the reunification of Germany, eastern households very quickly switched
from their heavy, sometimes unsafe irons to new, lighter western versions
with more features.
Further south, Italian housewives might find themselves ironing 10 shirts a
day. Anything that makes the chore easier, quicker and produces a better
result will lighten their load.
Sales of irons in Europe are rising in real terms even though volumes are
flat or down slightly, a sure sign of a market demand for more sophisticated
products.
But, as often happens in the appliance industry, the approach to innovation
falls somewhere between that of Japan and the US.
Japanese iron manufacturers are using electronics to give users information
considered of doubtful benefit in Europe - such as soleplate temperature. In
the US, by contrast, the market is driven by price - what European producers
scathingly call the 'Dollars 9.99 syndrome'. European irons are using
electronics more as a means than as an end - to control product functions
and improve safety.
But national markets still vary. Italy is the most innovative, says Leon
Ramselaar, ironing product manager at Philips. In the UK, says Ian Mackey,
Tefal UK's marketing manager, consumers do not want too many buttons to
press - believing there could be more to go wrong.
Tefal, its sister company Rowenta, and Philips dominate the European iron
market. When it comes to innovation, it is a 'nip and tuck affair'.
Occasionally, a company will come up with a feature that is enough in itself
to persuade consumers to buy, such as Tefal's replaceable anti-scale
cassette introduced in 1990.
Scale build-up can leave stains on clothes and the Tefal cassette system
converts the calcium carbonate that causes scale to sodium carbonate as the
water passes through it. Philips has now responded with a permanent
anti-scale system.
Other ideas might contribute to a purchase decision. Philips has just
introduced a drip-stop system for steam ironing on its top-of-the-range
irons. The idea, says Ramselaar, is to prevent the incomplete evaporation of
water which can cause drops to slip through and stain silks.
One important development is the 'ironing system'. Borrowed from commercial
ironing, this links the iron by tube to a steam-producing unit which acts
like a pressure cooker. The result is a lighter iron and more steam.
Producers are cagey about future plans, but Tefal and Philips are working on
'quantum leaps' in technology. One possibility is to use ceramic hob
technology to produce a new type of soleplate, ending the need for an
element.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Technology: Searching for the perfect rice cooker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession in Japan may have dampened consumers' appetite for electronic
goods, but a quick glance in any electrical retail shop in Tokyo shows it
certainly has not killed their taste for high technology.
The decline in consumer spending in Japan has led manufacturers to review
their product strategies and adjust their marketing and distribution plans
to the new environment. Product ranges and cycles have been reduced. Some
retailers report that certain manufacturers have clamped down on discounts
and rebates for poorly selling products.
However, one thing that has not been affected is the rising level of
sophisticated technology that manufacturers feel compelled to incorporate in
their products.
Take rice cookers, for example. There is no denying that the Japanese take
their rice seriously. But when facing a row of rice cookers, each proudly
proclaiming the use of microcomputers, induction heating or fuzzy logic, it
is difficult not to feel that things have gone a bit too far.
The key to cooking good rice is a strong initial burst of heat. Conventional
rice cookers, in which a coil at the bottom of the rice cooker heats the
inner pot, do not provide sufficiently strong heat. But a new range of rice
cookers has appeared on the market using a method known as induction
heating. Friction between a magnetic coil at the bottom of the cooker and
the pot that contains the rice creates the heat which is transferred through
the pot. The heat is stronger than in conventional cookers and spreads
around the pot to cook the rice evenly.
Induction heating is a method long used in industrial furnaces. With the use
of more semiconductors, rice cookers can also obey instructions to cook the
rice normally, or slightly drier or wetter than normal. Because the new rice
cookers do not just turn on and off, but can make subtle adjustments
depending on the circumstances, they are described as being 'neuro-fuzzy'.
From toasters to washing machines, manufacturers are testing the computer
programming skills of housewives with the use of microcomputers and liquid
crystal display panels that show any number of programmes which need to be
set up to get the machines to work. Manufacturers claim Japanese consumers
are becoming increasingly sophisticated and they are only trying to meet the
demands of consumers for better-performing household appliances. But it is
more likely that the excess of high technology in recent electronic products
stems above all from manufacturers' needs to stimulate consumer demand and
their desire to earn a higher profit from new products.
They are also clearly desperate to offer an incentive for domestic consumers
to replace their old equipment. According to the Economic Planning Agency,
the penetration rate of washing machines in Japanese households is 99.4 per
cent, while that of refrigerators is 98.9 per cent.
In a country where penetration of electrical goods is as high as it is, it
is not surprising that stimulating extra demand will take more than a few
extra buttons. However, added features also provide a convenient excuse to
raise prices. The latest rice cookers, for example, are about twice as
expensive as conventional ones.
As the difficulty consumers experience in programming video tape recorders
has shown, too much high technology runs the risk of turning away potential
buyers. Some manufacturers now recognise the need for easier-to-use
electronic equipment and have started to introduce much simplified products
such as VCRs.
Whether or not Japanese consumers are happy with all the high technology in
their homes, it will be some time before they start to express their
exasperation. Meanwhile manufacturers possess a powerful trump card. Since
the production of old models is usually discontinued after some time,
Japanese consumers are left with little chance to vote with their purses by
keeping them closed.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Technology: Tempted by green gadgetry - Andrew Baxter takes
a look at the latest innovations from white goods manufacturers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inside one of Zanussi's new dishwashers is a multiple detergent dispenser -
pour in the fluid and there's enough for a month before it needs refilling.
It is a simple idea, if less easy to put into practice, says Fulvio Caccio
of Electrolux, which owns the newly relaunched Zanussi brand. Making the
electrical parts humidity-proof was the main problem.
Zanussi and its rival white goods producers were displaying dozens of
similar innovations at last month's Domotechnica appliances show in Cologne.
The dominant theme of Domotechnica was the environment - from the reduction
and phasing out of CFCs in fridges to reducing water consumption of washing
machines and dishwashers. But functional innovation was an important
accompaniment and the technological challenge for the white goods industry
is twofold: to produce worthwhile new features and better environmental
performance.
A combination of both might just tempt consumers to trade in their old
machines before the end of their useful lives - crucial in mature western
markets. The Zanussi dishwasher, for example, has an alternate top and
bottom spray system to save water.
One way to tempt customers is to act on a good idea before the opposition.
But intelligent use of electronics is also vital for innovation and
enhancing environmental performance without confusing the customer. However,
this is where problems can arise.
According to a 1991 report by market research company Frost &amp; Sullivan on
Europe's white goods industry, 2 per cent of all semiconductors are used in
domestic appliances, and this share is rising.
'Microchips have made possible far more sophisticated switching, control and
timing devices,' says the report.
'However, many suspect these new 'bells and whistles, knobs and knockers'
are only a manifestation of unnecessary gadgetry . . . many doubt whether
the typical consumer really wants such frills and actually uses them.'
A few, at least, of the most recent functional innovations are not driven by
electronics. Electrolux, for example, has introduced a new, low-frost system
for chest freezers which cuts out 80 per cent of ice build-up.
Freezers warm up and cool down as the compressor switches off and on, but
here the dry air normally expelled in the warm-up phase is held in a
flexible cavity connected to the inside by a small pipe. When the freezer
cools down, dry air is recycled into the freezer rather than humid air which
deposits its moisture as ice on the freezer walls.
Another simple idea was launched by Whirlpool for its dishwashers - a 'long
door' which is counterbalanced to stay open in any position.
Most innovations, however, depend substantially on electronics. One of the
big issues at Domotechnica was the extent to which western producers would
introduce products with 'fuzzy logic' - where a central microchip receives
signals from several sensors in the machine and then sends out fresh
instructions accordingly.
The answer is that western producers are taking a much more selective
approach to fuzzy logic than their Japanese counterparts, which market the
concept heavily.
'In fridges and laundry products, I see us moving towards fuzzy logic in
this decade,' says Ronald Kerber, Whirlpool's chief technology officer. 'Not
because there is any desire by consumers to have it, but because of its role
in controlling the performance of the machine.'
AEG launched a washing machine with fuzzy logic that is due to go on sale in
Germany later this spring. The big German producer also enthuses about the
'massive potential' of fuzzy logic for appliance efficiency. The sensor
system means, for example, that the machine can ensure exactly the right
amount of water is used, making the half-load button redundant.
Whirlpool, meanwhile, launched its first fuzzy-logic product, a new 'Sixth
Sense' microwave for its top-selling VIP range. This eliminates the
guesswork from two common but boring tasks - reheating or defrosting food.
The user presses a single button to reheat or defrost and the oven works out
the type and weight of the food, then calculates the correct time and power
output. The cooking is left to be done manually.
The approach to 'interactive' or intelligent cooking is also cautious,
although some manufacturers believe the effort is worthwhile for top-range
machines. Fagor, the biggest Spanish producer, unveiled its Todo Plus oven
which combines traditional heat, circular heat and microwaves and links them
to a small screen in the control panel. This can show how to prepare more
than 125 recipes, work out quantities and choose the best cooking sequence.
AEG unveiled another important new feature, so-called Bio phase programming
for dishwashers and washing machines. This is geared to the latest
ultra-compact detergents for both types of machines, which include enzymes
that work best at low temperatures.
In AEG's new washing machine, the water is held at 40'C for 20 minutes to
allow the enzymes to work effectively, before it is heated to the set
temperature for the rest of the wash.
As for genuinely new products, one to watch - especially for microwave
producers - was the Jet-Stream Oven from Minnesota-based American Harvest.
This uses cyclonic cooking, a patented technology that heats air to 204'C
and moves it around the food at 2,200 feet per minute. The result, says the
producer, is oven-quality food at microwave speeds.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): The merchants' adventure
 -Charles Batchelor asks whether trade missions are of any value to smaller
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
John Major's recent return from Saudi Arabia with an order from King Fahd
for 48 Tornado aircraft in his briefcase focused attention on that
cornerstone of exporting: the trade mission. The prime minister was so
inspired by the experience that he enthused on his return about Britain's
need for 'merchant venturers, not merchants of gloom'.
But are trade missions of any relevance to the smaller business or are the
merchant venturers only to be found in larger companies? The deals which are
trumpeted are usually multi-million pound construction, engineering or
defence projects.
Nigel Grainger, founder of Offspring International, a two-year-old,
Droitwich-based export agency supplying products and services for the
offshore, petrochemical and power-generation industries, is proof that the
small business can make use of trade missions.
Grainger, who has one other full-time employee, one part-timer and a
projected turnover this year of Pounds 300,000-Pounds 350,000, spent eight
days in Yemen in December with a mission arranged by the London Chamber of
Commerce. He says he made useful initial contacts though he did not expect
people to place orders.
The Yemen trip was not without incident. Rioting prompted by the rising cost
of living prevented a lunch appointment in Sana'a with a visiting British
minister, says Tracey Dorrell, manager of the mission. A cancelled airline
flight led to a six and a half-hour drive through the mountains from Aden in
taxis which would probably not have passed a conventional test of
roadworthiness.
It is difficulties like these which prove the value of trade missions, says
John Dorrell, head of international services at the London chamber.
'Missions to countries which involve some discomfort or uncertainty tend to
be oversubscribed,' he says. 'People want the support of the group and the
backing of the local embassy. If there are unlikely to be problems, who
needs a trade mission? There are none to European Community countries.'
Missions are normally organised by either a chamber of commerce or a trade
association and typically consist of between 10 and 30 members. The
Department of Trade and Industry subsidises most missions but recently
modified its policy to make the programme more cost-effective. It raised
travel grants by between 5 and 25 per cent but placed a limit on the number
of missions a business could join. There is an overall limit of 10 with a
maximum of three to any single country except Japan, where the maximum is
five.
The past three years have seen a fall in the number of DTI-funded missions
but an increase in the number of businessmen and women travelling. In
1990-91 1,725 participants went out on 133 missions. By 1992-93 there were
just 123 missions but 2,350 participants, the DTI calculates. To encourage
small and medium-sized companies to join missions it normally requires 60
per cent of participants to be from businesses employing fewer than 500
people.
Although the organisers usually like to have a mix of participants from both
large and small companies there are particular benefits for the smaller
firm:
The chore of booking flights, hotels and making local travel arrangements is
removed.
Advice on local market conditions and the practicalities of doing business
is available from both the organisers and more experienced exporters. A
briefing meeting is usually held before the mission leaves and on arrival in
the foreign destination. The local embassy or high commission will produce
lists of contacts though it normally makes a charge.
A programme of receptions and visits is arranged. Participants are not
obliged to take part in these events but they can provide valuable
introductions. 'Don't just treat the mission as the chance of a cheap trip,'
says Tracey Dorrell.
Companionship. 'There is no substitute for travelling with other people,'
says Nigel Bateman, sales manager of Euro-Tech (Export), a Croydon-based
exporter of electronic components with 16 employees and sales of between
Pounds 2m-Pounds 3m. Bateman compares a recent visit to Saudi Arabia on a
London chamber mission with an earlier three-week visit to the Gulf states.
'Spending a lot of time on your own can sap your enthusiasm and means you
are less effective. The companionship of a mission is a big plus.'
Support when things go wrong. The organisers or the local embassy can help
with problems with visas or changes in travel arrangements. Women face
particular difficulties in many countries in the Middle East. Three women on
the Saudi mission were initially told they needed police approval to stay at
one hotel, though this demand was subsequently dropped. Cost. Government
subsidies do reduce the cost though some organisers think the sums involved
are not significant enough to affect a decision to participate. The London
chamber charged participants in its 10-day Saudi mission Pounds 1,269 with a
Pounds 350 rebate from the DTI payable on return. The chamber advises
participants to allow a further Pounds 50 a day for taxis, meals and
incidentals.
But the prospect of a cheap trip should not be a significant factor, the
experts say. Most important is whether the company's products or services
are likely to find a market in the country being visited. Once this has been
established the would-be exporter needs to check that he can repatriate the
proceeds of any sales. Will he be able to obtain insurance cover on the
commercial and political risks of that particular destination?
The exporter also has to be prepared for the extra business which may be
generated by the trip. Janet Crawford, managing director of London-based
Angel International Recruitment, calculates she won Pounds 120,000 worth of
business from her trip to Saudi Arabia. She says she was surprised by the
volume of business she obtained and estimates it will take a year to turn
the 'orders' (for trained personnel) into cash.
Participants should not necessarily expect to sign up firm orders on their
first visit. Making contacts and establishing confidence is a slow process
and regular visits will probably be necessary. 'Investigate the market on
your first trip,' advises Bateman. 'Don't expect to come away with armloads
of inquiries or orders. And don't be rushed into signing up exclusive agency
deals.'
A mission also requires careful preparation. Places must normally be booked
three months in advance to be eligible for DTI subsidies and participants
are advised to think about the trip well ahead of time. 'Some people don't
do their homework beforehand,' says Peter Valpy, director of the British
Knitting &amp; Clothing Export Council, which has five missions planned.
'Prepare good promotional material in advance and send it to the embassy for
distribution ahead of your visit,' he says.
A drawback of a trade mission is that it does require participants to keep
to the general timetable. The London chamber's 10-day mission to Saudi
Arabia involved three-day stops in Jeddah and Riyadh followed by a day of
rest and then three days in the Eastern Province. Some participants may find
they can generate most business in one location but have little to do in the
others.
This problem can be overcome by extending the visit, an option which is
permitted by the DTI rules. Jean Morgan-Bryant of Sebvia, an equipment
supplier to the oil and construction industries, extended her Saudi visit by
three days before flying on to another destination. Grainger says he makes
his first trip to a country with a mission but makes subsequent visits on
his own so he can set his own itinerary.
Missions organised by trade associations are normally only open to members.
Chamber of commerce missions are usually open to members and non-members and
to businesses outside the geographical area covered by the chamber. Contact
trade associations, chambers or the DTI's Outward Missions section Tel. 071

The barriers to cross-border venture capital investments is the subject of a
two-month survey initiated by the European Commission.
The survey, by accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, will identify the type of

Cross-border deals have not taken off as many venture capitalists expected
and the EC is keen to increase activity following the creation of the single

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Private individuals invest many times more in small businesses than the
formal venture capital sector in the US. But efforts to create a similar
investors' network in the UK have had only very limited success.
A new attempt to form such a network has come in the shape of The Capital
Exchange, a members-only organisation which publishes CX Monthly, a
newsletter to help investors find businesses seeking finance and businesses
seeking joint venture partners. The organisers, a group of Hereford
businessmen headed by Nigel Lacy, a former bank manager, plan to launch a
scheme for syndicating private equity investments later this year.

It found that in 75 cases banks had overcharged their customers, while in 70

overcharged was Pounds 1,412 a year while the undercharging amounted to
Pounds 956.
Bankchek ascribed the high error rate to poor administrative systems.

SURPLUSES arising in the pension funds of nationalised industries should not

Mr Donald Dewar, shadow social security secretary, said pensioners were

on pension fund assets.'
Trustees of British Rail's pension scheme are due to meet Mr John MacGregor,

SIR NICHOLAS LYELL, the attorney-general, yesterday took refuge behind
deputy speaker Mr Michael Morris in declining to advise MPs on whether they
could reverse the government's opt-out from the Maastricht treaty's social

Questioned by Labour frontbencher Mr John Fraser, Sir Nicholas said he was
'surprised' to be invited to comment on an amendment to the bill which Mr
Morris was still considering whether MPs would be able to debate.
Mr Fraser had asked whether an amendment tabled by Mr Calum MacDonald,
Labour MP for Western Isles, or any other, would be an effective route via
which MPs could adopt the social chapter.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Sales to Iran face tighter controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN IS tightening controls on sales of defence-related equipment and
so-called dual-use technology to Iran, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary, announced yesterday.
The Department of Trade and Industry will not approve licences for items on
international lists of banned military or atomic energy equipment.
Licences will also be refused for attempted exports of any equipment 'where
there was knowledge or reason to suspect that it would go to a military
end-user or be used for military purposes'.
There will be two exceptions to new guidelines, announced in a written
answer to a parliamentary question: goods judged essential for the safety of
civil aircraft and radioactive material for medical use.
The Foreign Office would not elaborate last night on the reasons for the
changes but it is thought they are aimed at blocking potential loopholes in
the old guidelines.
These were announced in 1985 and applied to equipment which the government
felt 'significantly enhanced the capability' of Iran and Iraq following the
outbreak of their territorial conflict.
Iranian groups have approached UK exporters recently for military parts to
replace equipment lost or damaged over the last 10 years, and some western
officials have expressed fears of a new military build-up.
Last month UK customs officers interviewed a number of UK businessmen after
seizing about 12,000 counterfeit engine parts for US-made Iranian jet
fighters. The Foreign Office said last night that Tehran's continuing death
threat against the author Salman Rushdie remained a 'factor in our bilateral
relations', although the issue was not directly related to yesterday's
announcement.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Councils map for Wales to be
redrawn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAP of local government in Wales is to be redrawn for the second time in
19 years.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, yesterday announced his intention to replace
the eight counties and 37 districts with 21 unitary authorities responsible
for all services.
Elections for the new councils will be held next year and the authorities
will come into being legally on April 1 1995.
Making the announcement - appropriately on St David's day - Mr Hunt said the
'desirable reform' would give electors a 'better understanding of who is
providing local services, which will result in greater accountability'.
The reshaping of local councils brings to an end two years of talks. A
similar reorganisation is being discussed in Scotland and in England, where
the Boundaries Commission is not likely to report for some time.
Mr David Thomas, chairman of the Council of Welsh Districts, said the reform
would give Wales 'a system of government that can for the first time be
clearly understood by the people it serves'.
The Assembly of Welsh Counties, which had lobbied against diminishing county
powers, made no statement. Under Mr Hunt's proposals, county names such as
Clwyd, Dyfed, Gwent and Gwynedd - introduced by a Conservative government in
1974 - will disappear. Names then wiped off the local-government map, such
as Monmouthshire, Pembrokeshire, Carmarthenshire and Cardiganshire, will
re-appear along with new districts such as Heads of the Valleys in south
Wales.
The reform will affect 120,000 workers though the districts. Mr Thomas did
not think more than 1,000 - 'all in central administration' - would lose
their jobs.
A report last month by management consultants Touche Ross put the cost of
the re-organisation ranging from as little as Pounds 66m over 15 years to as
much as Pounds 153m at constant prices.
Touche Ross also projected potential savings from a minimum of Pounds 17m a
year, and Mr Hunt said he was 'confident the reorganisation will pay for
itself well within 15 years'.
The Welsh capital, to be known in future as the City and County of Cardiff,
is to be given a special role.
A study is to be undertaken of how the city, and its position as capital,
should develop over the next 25 years.
Mr Hunt told MPs Wales would lead the UK out of the recession. Announcing a
five-year programme for the regeneration of the valley communities, he
insisted the portents were good for the whole of Wales to 'go for growth'.
The Welsh secretary also looked to the new local government structure based
on a single tier of 21 unitary authorities to secure a more co-ordinated
approach to economic issues through the Welsh Economic Council.
He emphasised that Wales had established itself internationally as the
'first option for new projects and expansion'.
Assurances by Mr Hunt that the reform of local government was unlikely to
lead to massive redundancies failed to satisfy Mr Ron Davies, the shadow
Welsh secretary, who said the high level of unemployment was 'blighting the
economy of Wales'.
Mr Hunt emphasised the success of the first five-year programme for the
valleys, due to end on March 31, in bringing to bear the full range of
government policies on the problems and challenges of a single area.
He said the creation of long-term sustainable employment of improved quality
should be the first objective.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Smith outlines plan for
constitutional change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH last night called for 'a fundamental shift in the balance of
power between the citizen and state' as the central goal of a wide-ranging
programme of constitutional reform.
In a clear effort to seize on the widely-perceived 'atmosphere of decline
and gloom' across Britain, the Labour leader attributed the mood to poor and
unaccountable government feeding a sense of impotence among the public.
He poured scorn on Mr John Major's claims to champion citizens' interests by
warning that 14 years of Conservative rule had reinforced alienation and
centralised power and had left Westminster 'dictatorial and remote'.
Siding firmly with the modernising faction in his party, he said: 'It is
clear to me that the institutions which purport to embody our country's
democracy no longer do so. Instead they hold real democracy back.'
Among a long list of proposals aimed at extending citizens' rights, Mr Smith
advocated an end to the practice of 'Budget purdah' - the traditional news
blackout before Budgets - and new legislation obliging companies to detail
remuneration packages for their directors.
Arguing for greater transparency in government, he also said that the
Central Statistical Office should be made statutorily independent and
accountable to Parliament as one of a number of measures aimed at
de-politicising the dispersal of official information.
A further move proposed in his speech in London to Charter 88, the lobby
group for constitutional reform, was the introduction of an annual State of
the Nation speech to the Commons in which the government would outline the
economic outlook. A 'green budget' might also be published to inform a wider
debate on the economy.
But Mr Smith was careful to stop short of declaring his own position on
electoral reform, now being debated by the Plant committee, which will
report to the Labour party conference later this year.
He would not be drawn on his views on House of Lords reform, beyond
reaffirming his opposition to the hereditary principle.
The bulk of his 21-page speech covered familiar territory, not least the
long-promised revival of the powers of local government and a new tier of
government for Scotland, Wales and the English regions.
It also included Labour's longstanding commitment to freedom of information
legislation and the incorporation of European human rights principles in a
Human Rights Act, overseen by a Human Rights Commission.
Alongside these came a pledge to create a Justice Ministry, empowered to
pull together supervision of the law and its reform under one departmental
roof.
Party officials underlined that the speech built on Mr Smith's address to
Labour's local government conference at Bournemouth last month in which he
attempted to redefine the party's central goal as broadening opportunities
for individual citizens.
That message has been echoed in speeches by other Labour frontbenchers,
including an attack on vested interest groups by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Lords fight bill to reform unions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS were warned yesterday of changes they will be pressed to make to
the latest bill on trade union reform, as the legislation began its passage
through the House of Lords.
The most vehement opposition to the bill, which includes the provision to
abolish wages councils, came from Labour and Liberal Democrat peers led by
Baroness Turner of Camden for Labour. Some elements of it were also
criticised by Tories.
Employers' groups expressing serious reservations about the measure - cited
by peers on both sides of the House as the measure was given a second
reading - included the Confederation of British Industry, the Industrial
Society, the Association of British Chambers of Commerce and the Engineering
Employers' Federation.
The two provisions about which employers are particularly unhappy are the
greater freedom for individuals to join the union of their choice, and the
proposed changes to the 'check-off' arrangements, though which union dues
are deducted automatically from employees' pay.
The bill would mean that an employee would have to indicate continuing
approval of the arrangement every three years. Lord Prior, a former Tory
cabinet minister and chairman of GEC, the electronics and telecommunications
group, emphasised the importance to foreign companies investing in the UK of
the ability to negotiate single-union deals. 'That is the nub of the problem
with the bill,' he said.
Lord Murray of Epping Forest, a former general secretary of the TUC, warned
Viscount Ullswater, the junior employment minister, that the bill made rods
for employers' backs.
Baroness Young, another former minister, welcomed much of the bill, but said
the government should think again about the provisions on maternity leave.
Reflecting the views of the Equal Opportunities Commission, she said that
the provision allowing women 14 weeks might well not be long enough, and
that it might be to the benefit of employers as well as their staff to
increase it to 18 weeks.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tory associations criticise Fowler
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Tory leadership faces an embarrassing row with party activists later
this week over its refusal to give local constituency associations a direct
role in the running of party headquarters.
Supporters of the Party Reform Steering Committee - a pressure group seeking
democratic accountability within the party organisation - have tabled a rare
motion of censure condemning the management reforms unveiled last month by
Sir Norman Fowler, the party chairman.
The motion, which will be debated on Friday at a meeting of the
Conservatives' policy-making Central Council, has the support of at least 50
local party associations.
It underlines the rumbling discontent among activists over the autocratic
style of the party's Smith Square headquarters and the debt of nearly Pounds
20m it has accumulated in recent years. Many associations are refusing to
hand over funds to the national party organisation.
The council, which meets once a year, brings together the various wings of
the party including MPs, MEPs, local associations and councillors. Public
debate of censure motions is highly unusual.
Moved by the Brentford and Isleworth association, the motion condemns the
refusal of the party's National Union to call a special meeting to examine
proposals for a radical overhaul of the party machine.
The steering committee wanted the council to establish a party executive
committee - with at least half its members elected by a postal ballot - to
take over responsibility for the administration of Conservative Central
Office and the party's central funds.
But Sir Norman blocked the attempt by questioning the credentials of some of
the 50 local associations supporting the demand. Some of the associations
were alleged not to have paid their subscriptions.
The party chairman then unveiled his alternative plan for a new, appointed
board of management under his chairmanship to bring together the different
wings of the party. In parallel, the party chairman announced more than 60
job losses as part of an economy drive designed to reduce the debt.
But Mr Michael Normington, the chairman of the pressure group, yesterday
condemned the new board as having 'no constitutional basis'.
He said that it could be changed or scrapped by Sir Norman at any time and
would not provide any democratic accountability for party members.
Mr Normington also attacked the procedures under which party headquarters
hoped to have his blueprint endorsed by the central council. Sir Norman's
plan will be debated at a special session on Friday morning, before many
party activists have arrived in Harrogate for the council's formal opening
session later that afternoon.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Hunt optimistic on future of
valleys
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WALES would lead the UK out of the recession, Mr David Hunt, the Welsh
secretary, told the Commons last night when announcing a five-year programme
for the regeneration of the valley communities, Ivor Owen writes.
Insisting that the portents were good for the whole of Wales to 'go for
growth', he also looked to the new local government structure based on a
single tier of 21 unitary authorities, to secure a more co-ordinated
approach to economic issues through the Welsh Economic Council.
Mr Hunt emphasised that Wales had established itself internationally as the
'first option for new proejcts and expansion'.
Assurances by Mr Hunt that the reform of local government was unlikely to
lead to massive redundancies failed to satisfy Mr Ron Davies, the shadow
Welsh secretary, who said the high level of unemployment was 'blighting the
economy of Wales'.
Mr Hunt emphasised the success of the first five-year programme for the
valleys, due to end on March 31, in bringing to bear the full range of
government policies on the problems and challenges of a single area.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Backbenchers strain for leadership
amid gloom - Ralph Atkins takes soundings from the Tory rank and file
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUIET Monday afternoon in the Commons chamber, dominated by Welsh business
and with no votes scheduled, gave the normally loyal Tory MP, chatting in
Members' Lobby time, a chance to ponder on the leadership qualities of the
prime minister.
'If you are saying, do we want a return to the apparent certainties of
Margaret Thatcher, then definitely 'no',' he decided.
'But we are being a bit wishy-washy. John Major's friends are trying to get
a bit of clarity of thought.'
His words were, perhaps, harsher than he intended. But the sense of unease
within Tory ranks at Westminster - though still a notch or two from open
revolt and driven largely by economic gloom - was palpable yesterday.
The prime minister's falling poll ratings have encouraged a febrile
atmosphere to which there seems no early respite. Only 19 per cent of
electors believe he is a capable leader, according to a Mori poll for The
Times. Just 21 per cent believe he understands the problems facing Britain.
'What is worrying is the criticism of Major coming from the constituency
parties,' said one young Tory, first elected last April. 'It is not acerbic
like the newspaper editorials, but it is there.'
A combination of past incidents and looming difficulties has meant that
among Tory MPs it is almost unfashionable not to add a measure of cynicism
or malice in the privacy of the Commons' lobbies.
The Maastricht bill is bogged down in committee, good economic news is
elusive, a package to save coalpits has yet to be agreed, and the
by-election in Newbury, caused by the death of Mrs Judith Chaplin, is
already being written off by many Tories as a Liberal Democrat gain.
'I would be amazed, astonished and delighted if we won; I reckon we will
lose by 5,000,' said one Tory MP for a constituency not far from the town.
Mr Major's efforts to impose authority are not yet seen as credible by the
right wing. There is frustration that Maastricht has pushed out other
government business, that there is an apparent vacuum of new ideas from the
cabinet.
An obviously stage-managed revolt by government loyalists against the
Euro-rebels at a backbenchers' meeting last Thursday won a few headlines but
changed nobody's mind.
'There is no leadership,' said an MP who voted for Mr Major to become prime
minister in 1990. 'What we get now and again is a petulant lashing-out -
headlines saying, 'Major to crack down on Euro-sceptics'  - and then nothing
happens. It is like a turn-of-the-century plane, lots of flapping of wings
and noise and then the thing nosedives.'
In the background is Baroness Thatcher, still a totem for the Tory right,
and her former cabinet ministers. Mr John Biffen, ex-leader of the House,
wrote last week that there was a 'determined restiveness' on the Tory
backbenches. Lord Lawson, a past chancellor, has derided the government over
its handling of sterling's exit from the exchange rate mechanism.
A lunch last week, hosted by the former prime minister and attended by
rightwing cabinet ministers Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, and
Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, set off
unsubstantiated murmurings of behind-the-scenes plotting.
In truth, ministers can legitimately argue that much of the pessimism is
transient and recession-related. 'The economy is always the thing that will
help bolster the government,' admited one Euro-sceptic. One veteran MP was
prepared to go against the trend. 'There is nothing unusual about the mood,'
he insisted.
But, for now, many Conservatives are restless over Mr Major's apparent
reluctance to replace Mr Norman Lamont as chancellor. 'A lot of the
pessimism is because of the occupant of Number 11 Downing Street,' said one
London Tory. 'There is a universal feeling that he should go to another
department.
'But I suppose that reflects frustration about Mr Major and his leadership
credibility.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / M0 growth lifts retail sales hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH IN circulation grew strongly last month, raising hopes that retail
sales continued to rise in February, according to Bank of England figures
released yesterday.
Narrow money, M0 - consisting mainly of notes and coins in circulation  -
increased by a seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent in the year to February. The
rise breached the government's official target range of zero to 4 per cent
for the second consecutive month. In the year to January M0 rose by 4.1 per
cent.
However, Treasury officials indicated that the latest increase was unlikely
to prompt tighter monetary policy. Other indicators are showing different
trends. Growth of the broad money measure M4 - M0 plus bank and building
society deposits - is below the floor of its 4 per cent to 8 per cent
monitoring range and inflation indices continue to point to disinflationary
pressures in the economy.
The 0.7 per cent month-on-month rise in M0 in February points to buoyant
consumer spending. A number of other factors could explain the higher than
expected monthly and annual increases in the narrow measure of the money
supply.
Economists said recent reductions in base rates to 6 per cent meant that
there was less incentive for people to hold money in savings accounts, which
could account for the boost to cash in circulation.
Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Greenwell Montagu, said: 'Low interest
rates means that once money is withdrawn it stays out for longer.'
At the same time borrowing on credit cards, the rates for which have stayed
relatively high, is expensive and is acting as a further incentive to use
cash rather than credit.
The strong growth of M0 might also reflect the fact that people are buying
cheaper goods that can be purchased with cash, rather than expensive durable
goods.
Mr Bootle said: 'I suspect that there is rather a lot in the balance of all
these factors and it would not be the first time that a monetary indicator
is giving a misleading picture.'
Many retailers say the rise in sales that started over the Christmas and new
year period was maintained into February. The British Retail Consortium said
yesterday it expected February's trading figures to be 'reasonable.'
WH Smith said the firmer tone that came in after Christmas has been broadly
maintained. Sales were stronger both compared with the same time last year
and with the autumn period.
The John Lewis Partnership said its department store chain had seen
encouraging sales growth of 5.9 per cent for the first three weeks of
February compared with the same period last year.
Revised figures from the Bank of England showed that bank and building
society lending to the private sector rose in January by Pounds 4.36bn after
a fall of Pounds 198m in December.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Birt-type deals said to be common
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAX CONSULTANTS say arrangements similar to Mr John Birt's employment
contract with the BBC are common among entertainers, computer consultants,
North Sea divers, fishermen and non-executive directors of large companies.
Ms Moira Elms, senior manager at Coopers &amp; Lybrand Financial Planning, says
Mr Birt's position as sole employee of a limited company in which he is the
sole shareholder was 'a valid arrangement and the Inland Revenue have a
difficult time overturning it'.
In 1897 the House of Lords ruled that an employee of a company is legally
distinct from the company itself, even if he or she is the only shareholder.
To prove otherwise, the Revenue would have to 'pierce the corporate veil,'
tax consultants say.
Mr Lochlan Hickey, partner at KPMG Tax Partners, identifies two main
advantages of the arrangement: cashflow benefits as tax is not deducted at
source and the freedom enjoyed by limited companies in deducting legitimate
business expenses for tax purposes.
The disadvantages are that the limited company must comply with all
Companies Act rules, including filing annual accounts at Companies House and
holding an annual general meeting - even if attended by only one person. It
must also pay national insurance contributions and VAT and corporation taxes
which, at 25 per cent to 35 per cent of profits, are preferable to the 40
per cent income tax on top-rate salaries.
Mr Hickey says the Inland Revenue has intervened where an employer has used
a one-person limited company to fill a position likely to be ongoing.
Employers and executive recruitment specialists expressed surprise that the
Revenue would grant freelance consultancy status to executives earning their
living predominantly from one source.
Mr Peter Brown, chairman of Top Pay Research Group, which advises
non-executive directors, says it is 'virtually inconceivable' that a
permanent chief executive would be employed on a freelance basis.
Mr John Courtis of Courtis &amp; McManus, the headhunters, warns that companies
employing executives as freelances could be held liable for outstanding tax
liabilities.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Street-Porter paid via company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC'S head of Youth and Entertainment Features, Ms Janet Street-Porter,
is paid as a freelance through her own private company.
Janet Street-Porter Ltd is a company set up principally 'to provide and
promote the services of Miss Janet Street-Porter in broadcast, journalism,
films and television'.
The company had a turnover of Pounds 94,256 last year, according to records
which have been filed at Companies House. This would have included other
freelance earnings apart from her BBC salary.
The company had distribution costs of Pounds 9,775 and administrative
expenses of Pounds 39,364, leaving an operating profit of Pounds 45,117.
For the past four years Ms Street-Porter has been a senior programme
executive at the BBC, but is a freelance on two-year contracts. Last year
she paid corporation tax of Pounds 11,515.
Last night the BBC declined to discuss Ms Street-Porter's payment
arrangements.
Ms Street-Porter said in a statement that she had been 'a freelance for over
20 years, including broadcasting, writing books, journalism, television
presentation and television production'. She added that her last contract
with the BBC ran out at the end of December 1992 and that arrangements for a
new one were still under discussion.
It is apparently not unusual for heads of department at the BBC not to be
members of staff.
Mr Jonathan Powell, who resigned as controller of BBC1 in December, was
never on the staff of the BBC. His successor Mr Alan Yentob always has been.
London Weekend Television confirmed last night that four executives were
paid in part through private companies. They are Mr Marcus Plantin, former
director of programmes who is now ITV's network director; Mr Greg Dyke,
chief executive and also non-executive chairman of GMTV, the breakfast
television company; Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs; and Mr
Brian Tesler, former managing director of the company.
The LWT annual accounts make clear that part of the services of all four is
paid in this way. In each case it is believed the main part of the salaries
are paid to them as employees.
Mr Dyke's company, Vine Productions, had a turnover of Pounds 52,810 in the
year to March 1991 and made a profit of Pounds 32,503.
Payment through a service company in ITV has been less usual in recent years
because of the growth of share option schemes.
The Inland Revenue said that only employees and full-time directors of
companies are eligible for share options. Full-time directors of a company
cannot be executive directors of another company.
Other benefits such as profit-sharing schemes and redundancy pay are also
linked to employee status.
Meanwhile, there was widespread agreement yesterday, before Mr Birt's change
of heart, that his method of payment was untenable for a director-general of
the BBC.
Senior broadcasters who met yesterday to start the organisation of the next
Royal Television Society Cambridge convention saw it as 'extraordinary
behaviour'. They decribed it as a moral issue.
The political reaction to the revelations about Mr Birt's salary was
low-key. The general feeling at across the parties at Westminster was that
it was up to the BBC to determine the details of Mr Birt's remuneration
package.

FT  02 MAR 93 / When taxing questions need an answer: Peter Norman examines
ways in which Lamont could bring some extra revenue to the Treasury - Spring
Budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF NEARLY 14 years of Conservative government have achieved anything, it is
a reduction in the burden of direct taxation placed on the individual. But
with Britain's public sector borrowing requirement widely forecast to reach
Pounds 1bn a week in 1993-94 even the most sacred cows have to come under
critical scrutiny.
As Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, considers whether to start increasing
taxes to curb the UK's growing budget deficits in his March 16 Budget, it is
an odds-on bet that Treasury officials have been weighing the merits of
raising more revenue through income tax or National Insurance contributions.
There are political and economic constraints on precipitate action. The
Tories owe their fourth term in office largely to their fierce opposition to
Labour's manifesto plans for a sharp increase in direct taxes on
middle-income families.
There are tentative signs of recovery in Britain's industrial and retail
sectors, but indices of consumer confidence have been slow to reflect any
upturn. And there are widespread fears that a sharp increase in direct
taxation could nip any revival of confidence in the bud.
It is therefore unlikely that the government will embark on large-scale
revenue raising through direct taxes in 1993-94. But it will be conscious of
a need to close the budget gap in the years ahead and that eliminating or
reducing some of the anomalies in the income tax and National Insurance
systems could serve this goal. In the short term there are plenty of
relatively minor changes that would bring increased revenue.
The most obvious step would be to freeze the allowances and thresholds
enjoyed by all Britain's 24.8m income tax payers. Under the provisions of
statutory indexation these are due to go up by 2.6 per cent in 1993-94
unless parliament decides otherwise.
The projected 2.6 per cent increase reflects the rate of retail price
inflation in the year to last December. It already looks generous compared
with January's 1.7 per cent inflation rate and expectations that retail
price inflation will fall further this spring.
Most taxpayers would not suffer a great loss if the personal allowance - the
amount of income that all people can enjoy before income tax is levied -
were held at the 1992-93 level of Pounds 3,445 instead of rising in line
with indexation to Pounds 3,565 in 1993-94.
A 20 per cent income taxpayer with a taxable income of up to Pounds 2,000
would forego 34 pence a week. A higher rate taxpayer paying 40 per cent on
taxable income of more than Pounds 23,700 would 'lose' 69p a week if the
personal allowance were frozen. He or she would forego a further Pounds 2.0l
weekly if the upper 'basic rate limit' at which the 25 per cent basic rate
of income tax gives way to the top 40 per cent rate were not indexed upwards
to Pounds 24,400.
Freezing all allowances would save the government Pounds 750m in the next
tax year with three quarters of the saving coming from no change in the
personal allowance. The main disadvantage of such a blanket freeze would be
to inflict a real-income loss on very low paid workers who would be brought
into the tax net on the strength of only modest wage increases.
The Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested as an alternative that the
chancellor might choose to freeze just the married couple's allowance and
the basic rate limit. Such action would be in line with recent practice, but
the yield would be comparatively small. Another option canvassed by the
institute would be to restrict the value of the personal allowance to the
basic tax rate rather than subtract it as at present from gross income to
obtain taxable income.
Such a change would be a blow to Britain's 1.7m higher-rate taxpayers, for
whom the personal allowance is worth Pounds 1,378 a year compared with
Pounds 861.25 for the basic-rate taxpayer. But the yield for the government
would be large - about Pounds 1.3bn according to IFS estimates - nearly as
much as the Pounds 1.6bn that would be raised by a 1 percentage point
increase in the basic rate of tax to 26 per cent.
Mr Lamont's direct tax options do not stop with income tax. Britain has a
second tax on incomes in the form of National Insurance contributions. But
the arguments for extracting more from this source are finely balanced.
Increased NI contributions of some sort might be quite easy to sell to the
electorate. NI contributions have long since ceased to finance a genuine
fund to pay for such social services as old age pensions or unemployment,
but they are generally perceived as serving that purpose. Mr Lamont could
point to the greatly increased cost of social security for the unemployed to
justify an increase in revenues from this source.
On the other hand, any radical increase in the NI take would lay the
chancellor open to a charge of misleading the electorate. During last year's
campaign he focused the Conservatives' counter attack on the Labour party's
plans to extend NI contributions to the full pay of middle and upper income
earners.
Increases in direct taxation are normally the preserve of the brave or the
strong. Mr Lamont has proved surprisingly resilient through the crises of
his chancellorship in the past six months, but his political position is
weak.
That fact and continuing uncertainty about the economy argue against radical
changes in UK direct taxes to redress the budget deficit. But the chancellor
has scope for action at the margin.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Freedom helps unlock offenders' potential: Alan Pike
examines the efforts of charities to divert young people from a life of
crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWELVE teenagers from Chatham, Kent, are unlikely to be among the first to
hear the news when Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, announces plans for a
new generation of secure schools for young offenders shortly.
They will be climbing a Welsh mountain as part of a motivational training
course run by Fairbridge, a charity working with young people from
disadvantaged inner-city backgrounds. Many of Fairbridge's clients are
offenders, including some likely candidates for Mr Clarke's new schools.
Fairbridge is one of a number of charities that try to divert young people
from crime. A group of the biggest - the Children's Society, National
Children's Homes, Rainer Foundation and Howard League for Penal Reform -
have been pressing unsuccessfully for a meeting with Mr Clarke ahead of his
announcement. They want to tell him that they fear the government is in
danger of making a serious and expensive mistake if more young offenders are
locked up.
During the 1980s there was a strong shift away from custodial sentences for
young people. The number of 14 to 17-year-old males sentenced to custody
fell from 7,700 in 1981 to 1,400 in 1991.
There were two major reasons for that. Custody seems to increase the
likelihood that a young person will reoffend, and it is also very expensive
 -the average weekly cost of a community penalty or probation order is only
5 per cent of a custodial sentence.
Follow-up studies of young people completing the eight-day Fairbridge course
show that around 60 per cent have gone on to jobs, education or further
training. A remarkable 85 per cent to 90 per cent retain contact with the
charity.
'It becomes more difficult to define and calculate success at times of high
unemployment,' says Mr Steve Mellors, manager of the Chatham project. 'If
someone who has spent five of the last six years in prison slows down his
reoffending rate, I regard that as success.
In financial terms the cost of the charity's course - around Pounds 400 -
would keep a teenager in a young offender's institution for a week.
A Department of Education report described the Fairbridge approach as an
excellent model reaching those young people who are most in need of help.
Yet the proportion of Fairbridge's income received from the public sector
has declined since the mid 1980s. Mr Michael Butler, the charity's southern
regional manager, says its work would be immeasurably enhanced by only an
extra Pounds 1m a year from the government. That compares with suggestions
that the new network of special schools could cost Pounds 75m to develop.
The message that leaders of the voluntary sector want to give Mr Clarke is:
'Most young offenders grow out of crime as they become more mature and
responsible. They need encouragement and help to become law-abiding. Even a
short period of custody is quite likely to confirm them as criminals,
particularly if they acquire new criminal skills from more sophisticated
offenders. They see themselves labelled as criminals.'
Until an explosion of media attention to youth crime last month united
government and opposition in calls for tougher penalties, the sector
believed ministers had already grasped the message, for the words quoted
above words come from the 1988 Home Office green paper Punishment, Custody
and the Community.

Growth in the supply of graduates is not being matched by demand from

the numbers going on to teacher training and further academic study.

professional property advisers and companies with head offices in northern
England, a survey by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm, shows.
Nearly 70 per cent of 154 firms or businesses surveyed expect an upturn in
northern property markets in the second half of this year. But while a
quarter of professionals in surveying, engineering and construction think
recovery is already under way, only 14 per cent of occupiers agree.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Gilts sales may force PSBR changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HEAVY purchasing of gilt-edged securities by banks and building societies in
January will increase pressure on the government to alter the rules by which
it finances the public sector borrowing requirement, Emma Tucker writes.
Official money supply figures from the Bank of England show that gilts sales
to banks and building societies in January totalled Pounds 2.84bn  - more
than three quarters of gilts sales in January. Sales to the non-bank private
sector were just under Pounds 500m.
The 'full-fund' rule means that the government does not recognise gilts sold
to UK banks and building societies as contributing to the funding of the
PSBR. This forces it to sell an equivalent amount to the non-bank sector.
The banking sector has tended to show little interest in UK government
stock. But the sharp fall in inflation and interest rates could increase the
attraction of gilts to them.

HEAVY purchasing of gilt-edged securities by banks and building societies in
January will increase pressure on the government to alter the rules by which
it finances the public sector borrowing requirement.
Official money supply figures from the Bank of England show that gilts sales
to banks and building societies in January totalled Pounds 2.84bn,
accounting for more than three-quarters of total gilts sales in January.
Sales to the non-bank private sector were just under Pounds 500m.
The current 'full-fund' rule means that the government does not recognise
gilts sold to UK banks and building societies as contributing to the funding
of the PSBR. This forces it to sell an equivalent amount to the non-bank
sector.
One argument against altering the full-fund rule was that the banking sector
previously showed little interest in UK government stock.
However, the sharp fall in inflation to an annual rate of 1.7 per cent in
January, along with the drop in short term interest rates to 6 per cent,
could increase the attraction of gilts for UK banks.
Banks purchased most of the gilts in January. They bought Pounds 2.48bn
while building societies bought Pounds 358m. The private sector bought
Pounds 497m.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Increase in unfair dismissals is alleged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS are increasingly sacking staff just before they qualify for
protection against unfair dismissal, the National Association of Citizen's
Advice Bureaux said yesterday.
The association pointed to 'growing exploitation' of employees during the
recession, reflected in an increasing number of complaints to bureaux on
employment issues. Such complaints represent the third-largest category of
enquiries dealt with by the service after consumer debt and social security.
The association yesterday published a report on the problem and pointed to
several cases which, it said, illustrated exploitation.
A bureau in Oxfordshire reported a case of a man dismissed after 23 months
and 3 weeks allegedly because he visited the toilet too often.
Bureaux also reported an increase in employers unilaterally changing
employees' terms and conditions, particularly in hours and pay.
A bureau in Taunton reported a 17-year-old youth who worked part-time for a
fast-food restaurant was dismissed because he objected to compulsory
Saturday working. His sister, who also worked at the restaurant, was made
full-time and expected to work 50 hours a week with no overtime pay.
The association's report made several recommendations to restrict
exploitation. It wants employees with six months' service to be able to
claim for unfair dismissal. The current threshold is two years.
At present full-time employees must have accumulated two years' continuous
service before they can claim unfair dismissal. Part-time workers working
between 8 and 16 hours a week have a qualifying period of five years.
'Without any doubt this lack of protection against unfair dismissal is the
dominant theme in the hundreds of thousands of employment problems the CABs
service deals with each year,' the association said.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Enforcing a punishing regime for offenders: Alan Pike
examines the efforts of charities to divert young people from a life of
crime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWELVE teenagers from Chatham, Kent, are unlikely to be among the first to
hear the news when Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, announces plans for a
new generation of secure schools for young offenders shortly.
They will be climbing a Welsh mountain as part of a motivational training
course run by Fairbridge, a charity working with young people from
disadvantaged inner-city backgrounds. Many of Fairbridge's clients are
offenders, including some likely candidates for Mr Clarke's new schools.
Fairbridge is one of a number of charities that try to divert young people
from crime. A group of the biggest - the Children's Society, National
Children's Homes, Rainer Foundation and Howard League for Penal Reform -
have been pressing unsuccessfully for a meeting with Mr Clarke ahead of his
announcement. They want to tell him that they fear the government is in
danger of making a serious and expensive mistake if more young offenders are
locked up.
During the 1980s there was a strong shift away from custodial sentences for
young people. The number of 14 to 17-year-old males sentenced to custody
fell from 7,700 in 1981 to 1,400 in 1991.
There were two major reasons for that. Custody seems to increase the
likelihood that a young person will reoffend, and it is also very expensive
 -the average weekly cost of a community penalty or probation order is only
5 per cent of a custodial sentence.
The charities believe the law already provides for the tiny group of
offenders who must be detained. They fear that the development of new secure
schools would encourage more frequent use of custody.
They say this would be at best a waste of money. At worse, says Ms Frances
Crook, director of the Howard League, it might mean 'a rise in the number of
children found hanging from their cell bars'.
Follow-up studies of young people completing the eight-day Fairbridge
course, which involves canoeing, abseiling and rock climbing, show that
around 60 per cent have gone on to jobs, education or further training. A
remarkable 85 per cent to 90 per cent retain contact with the charity.
'It becomes more difficult to define and calculate success at times of high
unemployment,' says Mr Steve Mellors, manager of the Chatham project. 'If
someone who has spent five of the last six years in prison slows down his
reoffending rate, I regard that as success.
'But in the better economic climate of 1985-86, more young people went into
jobs as a result of our Chatham scheme than were placed in employment by the
Chatham, Rochester and Gillingham Jobcentres.'
In financial terms the cost of the charity's course - around Pounds 400 -
would keep a teenager in a young offender's institution for a week. A
Department of Education report described the Fairbridge approach as an
excellent model reaching young people most in need of help.
Yet the proportion of Fairbridge's income received from the public sector
has declined since the mid 1980s. Mr Michael Butler, the charity's southern
regional manager, says its work would be immeasurably enhanced by only an
extra Pounds 1m a year from the government. That compares with suggestions
that the new network of special schools could cost Pounds 75m to develop.
The message that leaders of the voluntary sector want to give Mr Clarke is:
'Most young offenders grow out of crime as they become more mature and
responsible. They need encouragement and help to become law-abiding. Even a
short period of custody is quite likely to confirm them as criminals,
particularly if they acquire new criminal skills from more sophisticated
offenders. They see themselves labelled as criminals.'
Until an explosion of media attention to youth crime last month united
government and opposition in calls for tougher penalties, the sector
believed ministers had already grasped the message, for the words quoted
above words come from the 1988 Home Office green paper Punishment, Custody
and the Community.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Women engineers warn on equal opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERING union negotiators should refuse to sign annual pay and
conditions agreements with employers unless they contain an 'open commitment
to guaranteeing equal opportunities,' the women's section of the AEEU
engineering and electrical workers' union said yesterday .
The AEEU's ruling executive council looks certain to accept the unanimous
vote at the women engineers' annual conference that no agreements be signed
without the equal opportunities clause.
The conference also condemned Opportunity 2000, the employer-led initiative
which aims to improve the position of women in the workforce, as 'no more
than a convenient smokescreen' behind which companies were hiding.
Separately, the banking union Bifu accused employers in the finance sector
of paying lip service to equal opportunities and claimed that banks had lost
interest in issues such as childcare since the recession.
Mrs Edwina Hart, Bifu president, said of Opportunity 2000: 'It is very easy
for the banks to be involved in high-profile publicity campaigns like this,
but in reality they do nothing for women.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / ICI not to pay 'pool uplift' charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries will not have to pay 'pool uplift' charges for
the purchase of electricity from Teesside power station for its adjacent
Wilton site, the company announced yesterday, Michael Smith writes.
Since electricity privatisation, virtually all electricity in England and
Wales has had to be sold through a pool, or wholesale market, which then
results in a higher price to cover administration and other 'uplift' costs.
Until this decision on uplift charges by the pool executive committee, ICI
would have been liable to pay Pounds 1.5m a year to the pool on top of what
it will pay to the consortium that operates the power plant, which is on
land owned by ICI.
ICI said it was too early to say what the effects would be on talks to
bypass the pool at its Runcorn chlorine plant.
The situation there is different because the potential supplier, PowerGen,
would be physically separate from the plant and electricity would have to be
supplied through equipment owned by a regional electricity company.
South Wales Electricity is to reduce tariffs for more than 900,000 customers
for the second time in six months. Domestic customers paying quarterly will
see a 1 percentage reduction in bills.
Electricity prices for 3m Eastern Electricity customers are to be held at
1992 prices for a year from April.
Both companies made their decisions following reductions in the price of
coal which is used to generate electricity.

<TEXT>
REDUNDANT and retired managers are to be recruited for a 'timeshare' scheme
piloted by Recharge North East, an initiative launched yesterday to help
regenerate former coalfield areas in north-east England, Chris Tighe writes.
Recharge will employ managers on part-time contracts, placing them in small
and medium-sized enterprises on tasks aimed at helping companies survive and
grow.
Recharge's director, Mr Danny Sharpe, a former deputy director of the
Department of Trade and Industry in the region, said many smaller companies
lacked spare management capacity to implement the advice they were given.
The Pounds 3m, three-year Recharge initiative is funded by the DTI, British
Coal Enterprise and the European Community's Rechar programme for declining
mining areas.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Monopolies body looks at condom market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 45m a year condom market is to be investigated by the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said changes in the
market meant price controls introduced after an earlier MMC inquiry in 1982
needed to be reviewed.
The supply of contraceptive sheaths in the UK is dominated by LRC Products,
part of the London International Group, which has about 75 per cent of the
market with its Durex brand.
Mates - originally owned by the Virgin Group but sold three years ago to the
Australian Ansell Corporation - is the second largest with about 20 per cent
of the market.
When the MMC last looked at the market it concluded that LRC's monopoly
position with 90 per cent to 95 per cent of the market operated against the
public interest and that its prices might be expected to become excessive.
LRC gave undertakings to the Office of Fair Trading that it would limit
growth in its average realised price (total UK turnover divided by total UK
volume) to below 1.5 per cent below an index of costs close to the retail
prices index.
Sir Bryan said yesterday: 'Although the price control arrangements have
restrained the rate of increase of average realised prices, I believe the
market has changed and the price control arrangements now need to be
reviewed.'
He added he would be particularly interested in the MMC's views on the price
control mechanism and whether it had damaged the prospect of successful
competition from Mates and other suppliers.
LIG yesterday welcomed the MMC reference. It said the business affected
represented about Pounds 20m of sales, at wholesale prices, 5 per cent of
group turnover.
LIG's shares fell on the news but recovered to close unchanged at 220p.
The company agreed circumstances had changed since 1983, citing the arrival
of Mates as a strong competitor in the market and the Aids problem.
LIG, which is a leading maker of condoms worldwide, said the UK was the only
market where it faced price controls.
With LIG as market leader competitors cannot charge more for their products.
LIG is likely to argue to the MMC that price controls hinder competition,
deterring competitors from entering the market. It may also argue that
consumers are thought to put safety and reliability above price when making
purchasing decisions.
The commission has been given nine months to report.
The MMC yesterday took the unusual step of issuing a statement to correct
press reports that it has already reached conclusions on its investigation
into the supply of national newspapers. The commission said it still hoped
to report by the end of July.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANTHONY PARNES and Mr Gerald Ronson, who were convicted of theft in the
first Guinness trial, have asked Mr Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, to refer
their cases back to the Court of Appeal.
Lawyers for Mr Parnes believe that evidence showing that share support
operations were common City practice in the 1980s was in the hands of the
Serious Fraud Office before the trial began.
The evidence of indemnities being given to assist in six other takeover bids
was given to the Department of Trade and Industry by directors of TWH/NV, a
licensed share-dealing firm, during a separate investigation and then passed
to the SFO, the lawyers believe.
Mr Parnes might have conducted his defence differently had this evidence
been known about during his trial, Mr Keith Oliver, his solicitor, said
yesterday.
'It is our view that a serious miscarriage of justice has occurred,' he
said.

PROCEDURES for in-vestigating monoplies and mergers by the UK competition
authorities are slow in focusing on the real issues, involve duplication of
effort and impose an unnecessary burden on managements over an extended
period, according to a survey by accountants Ernst &amp; Young.
The survey of 25 companies involved in recent Monopolies and Mergers
Commission inquiries found the Office of Fair Trading was thought to be too
quick to initiate inquiries and gave inadequate explanations of the reasons
for references to the commission.
The companies also felt the commission collected too much detailed
information and that there was a lack of commercial awareness in the OFT and
the commission. They also felt that MMC inquiries were too wide-ranging.
Issues of little relevance were often left open at a late stage of the
inquiry.
The majority of the companies felt the OFT and the commission should be
merged but many of them wanted to preserve the MMC's independent role.
Ernst &amp; Young recommends that OFT investigations should be more in-depth so
that they can be either terminated before referral to the commission or
passed on for a shorter inquiry.
In the recent green paper Abuse of Market Power the government indicated
that it planned to increase the OFT's investigatory powers and give the MMC
responsibility for handling appeals against decisions of the
director-general of fair trading rather than undertaking an investigation
itself.
Ernst &amp; Young welcome these proposals but say they do not go far enough as
they only affect anti-competitive practice and restrictive trade practices
investigations. It says there is no logic in merger and monopoly
investigations still being undertaken by the commission following an OFT
investigation. The accountants say their proposals would significantly
reduce the average length of inquiries as well as avoiding unnecessary
duplication.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Leyland Daf truck plant nears supply deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was new hope yesterday for the 1,346 workers at the threatened Leyland
Daf truck plant in Lancashire after an agreement was reached in principle
for Leyland to supply trucks to Daf Trucks NV, the Dutch company created on
Friday.
The agreement, which the administrative receivers of Leyland Daf said
yesterday 'still needs a lot of 'i's dotting and 't's crossed', was reached
after a week of talks in Eindhoven in the Netherlands.
They took place between Mr John Gilchrist, the Leyland truck plant's
managing director, and the management of the Dutch company created by
receivers in the Netherlands with aid from the Dutch and Belgian
governments.
As a result, and provided that a detailed agreement is reached, the Leyland
plant could soon step up production substantially.
It is now making about 50 trucks a week to fulfil its outstanding orders.
Mr Gilchrist, who is leading a planned management buy-out of the Lancashire
truck operations, was negotiating the agreement on behalf of the receivers,
Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of the accountancy firm Arthur
Andersen.
One reason for the protracted length of the talks is understood to have been
the need to establish how readily the supply agreement could be transferred
to any new owner of the Leyland facilities.
The receivers refused to speculate on when a final agreement would be
reached.
Factors still to be settled include the volume of trucks and the precise
financial terms under which the vehicles would be supplied.
However, all sides indicated yesterday that they were treating the issue as
a matter of urgency and seeking a conclusion within days rather than weeks.
The boost to the truck factory's prospects came as a separate management
team at the Leyland Daf van plant in Birmingham, led by managing director Mr
Allan Amey, met the receivers to present its own formal proposals for a
management buy-out.
The Birmingham plant, which still employs 1,200 people, has resumed building
vans at a rate of 250 a week.
Both buy-outs are being advised by Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Ford cuts margin on Mondeo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD has cut its dealers' official profit margin, which is usually 16 per
cent to 17 per cent, to 10 per cent on its Mondeo cars, which are due to go
on sale on March 25.
The move helps Ford to claim that the Mondeo's retail prices, announced
yesterday, will be up to several hundred pounds lower than those of Sierra
models which the Mondeo will replace.
The new car is not quite the bargain Ford is seeking to make it, however,
because the Sierra's retail prices include a margin of 16 per cent to 17 per
cent for the dealer.
In addition, prices of the Sierra, which is imported from Ford's German and
Belgium plants, rose in January by an average of 7.5 per cent.
Ford, which increased prices of UK-built models by an average of 4.5 per
cent at the time, said the Sierra rise was necessary to compensate for
sterling's devaluation. It rejected speculation that such a rise would help
to make the Mondeo - Ford's first 'world car' - appear less expensive.
The company had little choice about cutting dealers' margins on the new car
because all its main rivals have already done so.
Such a move has allowed all these manufacturers to cut 'official' retail
prices.
However, this has little, if any, effect on the amount customers actually
pay for their cars. This is because the severely depressed new car market is
so competitive that dealers had been 'giving away' much of their 16 per cent
to 17 per cent margins anyway. The cut to an official 10 per cent margin
merely gives the dealers less room to manoeuvre.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Challenge of moving mountains: The difficulty of tackling
growing stocks of coal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIKE CHILDERLEY heaves a deep sigh as he peers down from the top of a 3m
tonne heap of coal next to the Cottam, Nottinghamshire, power station which
he manages.
There is enough coal there for six months, he says, but 'today, like every
day except Sundays, we have 17 trainloads of the stuff coming in'.
His problems are unlikely to ease. The government's four-month review of the
coal industry has come up with few solutions. But one almost certain to be
adopted in an attempt to save some of the 31 threatened pits involves
persuading the electricity generators to maintain or even increase stocks.
UK coal mountains have grown because demand for electricity has risen more
slowly than expected as a result of the recession, a mild winter, stronger
competition from the nuclear industry and a rise in imports.
Stockpiles in England and Wales are about 46m tonnes, enough to keep power
stations going for six months and three times the level the coal and
electricity industries believe is commercially justified.
British Coal has about 11.2m tonnes, against the 5m it would ideally like;
National Power has about 18m tonnes (against about 5m-6m) and PowerGen,
which owns Cottam, has 16m tonnes (5m-6m). British Coal executives argue
that maintaining or raising stockpiles would merely postpone pit closures.
'What we need is a bigger market, but the government does not seem prepared
to create that,' says one. 'Leaving coal stocks where they are merely means
that the market will collapse when the next five-year contracts with the
generators end.'
Some power stations may close before they burn all the coal they have. Even
for those like Cottam, with a secure future, there are considerable
penalties for being so overstocked.
Before the coal review, Mr Childerley planned to reduce his mountain to
about 750,000 tonnes in the next few years.
Each tonne of coal added to the pile adds 50p to the company's costs in
handling charges alone, on top of the cost of capital tied up in the stocks,
he says, adding that the stockpile can take little more. 'Our preference
would be that the coal stays in the bowels of the earth until it is needed,'
says Mr Childerley.
The government's preferred method of saving some pits hinges on persuading,
or coercing, the generators to take an extra 65.5m tonnes of coal over five
years. The generators say there is a firm market for 40m-43m tonnes.
PowerGen has said it wants about Pounds 140m for keeping stocks at their
current level; National Power, the larger of the two generators, has not
specified an amount but would want at least as much again as the amount
wanted by PowerGen.
Whatever the generators get, British Coal is likely to suffer most if
stockpiles remain high. By 1998, when the next set of contracts run out, the
coal industry is likely to be in the private sector and the government will
have less of an interest in preserving pits.
In addition the 34m tonnes in generators' stocks then would last a lot
longer than now because coal burning will have been reduced further as other
sources of fuel grow in importance.
'Imagine if by then BC has by then been split into several companies,' says
a BC executive. 'The generators will simply be able to pick one supplier off
against another.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / Coal chief warns of stockpile dangers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL CLARKE, chairman of British Coal, warned yesterday on the dangers of
keeping pits open by maintaining electricity generators' stockpiles. He
suggested that such a solution would deter potential buyers in
privatisation.
His comments to the Coal Industry Society in London came amid growing fears
among British Coal officials that the white paper on coal will depend
heavily on persuading the generators to keep stocks at high levels.
The generators currently hold stocks of about 35m tonnes but want to reduce
them by about a third.
Mr Clarke said that any additional demand for coal should result in it being
burnt and 'not simply put to stock'. British Coal needed a durable solution
to its problems.
Such a solution could only come from creating a more substantial market for
coal now, while not neglecting what happened beyond the five-year contracts
likely to be agreed shortly.
'The longer-term risk is in creating an artificial demand for coal. The end
of the five-year contract period would then almost certainly see further
intense pressure on our collieries.'
Mr Clarke said that any assessment of potential demand for coal must be
linked to a redesign of contract structures between British Coal and its
customers. The issues he had raised would have a fundamental impact on the
potential for privatising the business.
Behind Mr Clarke's comments is a growing feeling at the corporation that the
government's apparent solution will merely delay the closure of pits, with
the biggest danger point in 1998.
In that year the five-year contracts already tentatively agreed for 160m
tonnes between British Coal and the generators will end.
Additional contracts under discussion for a further 40m to 65.5m tonnes
would also expire then. If stocks remained at their current level, the
generators would be able to produce electricity without buying coal for more
than six months.
Mr Clarke said he found it sad and regrettable that leaders of the National
Union of Mineworkers were campaigning for strike action in a ballot to be
held later this week. He said: 'Industrial action could not be a worse
signal to send after we have rebuilt belief in the security of our
supplies.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / 'Timeshare' scheme piloted by Recharge North East
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUNDANT and retired managers are to be recruited for a 'timeshare' scheme
piloted by Recharge North East, an initiative launched yesterday to help
regenerate former coalfield areas in north-east England, Chris Tighe writes.
Recharge will employ managers on part-time contracts, placing them in small
and medium-sized enterprises on tasks aimed at assisting the companies to
survive and grow.
Recharge's director, Mr Danny Sharpe, a former deputy director of the
Department of Trade and Industry in the region, said the scheme was needed
because many smaller companies lacked spare management capacity to implement
advice they were given.
About 400 people have applied to advertisements in the region for the first
batch of 12 'timeshare' managers. Those selected will be placed in
companies, free of charge, for up to 10 days, possibly spread over many
weeks.
The Pounds 3m, three-year Recharge initiative is jointly funded by the DTI,
British Coal Enterprise and the European Community's Rechar programme for
declining mining areas.
The initiative was announced in October after the government's decision to
close 31 pits. Mr Sharpe insisted that setting up Recharge had not
pre-empted final decisions on the threatened pits, but was designed to
cushion the effect of losing 18,000 north-east coalfield jobs since 1982.
Recharge will help smaller businesses improve marketing, identify those with
greatest growth potential and recruit volunteer businessmen as mentors for
small companies.

A ROW between customer and supplier has halted production of shuttle trains
intended to carry coaches and mini-vans through the Channel tunnel when it
opens at the end of this year, it emerged yesterday.
Bombardier Eurorail, the Brussels-based company building the trains for
Eurotunnel, said it had to stop making the shuttles because it had no room
left to store them.
It said its Bruges production line was blocked because Transmanche-Link, the
Franco-British contractor for the Channel tunnel, had failed to give the
necessary authorisations for deliveries to begin.
TML reacted with astonishment to the statement. 'TML has not received any
detailed particulars of any such claims from Bombardier. . .'
Bombardier is building 108 carriers for coaches and minivans as part of a
FFr4bn (Pounds 506m) contract for Channel tunnel rolling stock.

The project, which consists of two coal-fired 600 MW power units, will be
Indonesia's first privately built, owned and operated station linked
directly into the national grid.
The plant is at the heart of the government's drive to attract private

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government yesterday brushed aside US criticism of its
supercomputer procurement policy and went ahead with the installation of a
Japanese-made supercomputer in an attempt to end one of the most
controversial trade disputes between the two countries.
Japan's National Institute for Fusion Science, a government research
institute, has installed a supercomputer made by NEC, the Japanese
electronics group, which won a contract over Cray Research, a leading US
manufacturer.
The installation of the NEC machine rejects outright claims by the US that
the Japanese company won the contract as a result of a public procurement
policy that favours Japanese companies.
It comes as the US has stepped up pressure on Japan to open its markets,
particularly for high technology electronic products.
Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, expressed concern on Friday
about Japanese public procurement of supercomputers.
The US is sending Mr Ira Wolf, assistant trade rep-resentative, to Japan at
the end of the week to discuss a number of thorny trade issues, and is more
than likely to touch on government procurement of supercomputers.
Cray Research said yesterday it had not been able to evaluate, at a
demonstration held by the Japanese research institute, whether NEC's machine
met the performance criteria required to satisfy the terms of the bid. The
US company has questioned whether NEC's machine could actually do what it
professed to do and claimed that the institute had used an evaluation
process that favoured NEC's machine.
The Japanese government, which set up a Supercomputer Procurement Review
Board after US threats of retaliation, rejected Cray's complaint last
October. The research institute held a test of the NEC machine's performance
last week and found it met required criteria.
The Japanese side believes it holds a trump card and is not prepared to bow
readily to US demands.
'Cray has already supplied a few supercomputers to Japanese government
institutes,' Mr Tadashi Watanabe, general manager of NEC's supercomputer
marketing division, pointed out yesterday. 'But not one US public body has
bought a Japanese supercomputer.'
A representative of the research institute said: 'We are the ones who bought
the supercomputer so we are the ones who need to be satisfied by the NEC
machine's performance.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Irish misty eyed over Digital days / A
look at the local impact of a shake-up in the world computer industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision last week by Digital Equipment, the US computer maker, to close
its manufacturing facility at Galway in the west of Ireland has produced
much dismay and soul-searching in Ireland.
Digital has been in Ireland for 22 years, and was the biggest employer in
the electronics sector until its decision to concentrate production at Ayr
in Scotland, with the loss of 780 jobs at the Galway factory.
The Irish government has blamed the British government for allegedly
offering lucrative government contracts to Digital (although it admits to
having no hard evidence).
The opposition blames the government and the Industrial Development
Authority for having done 'too little too late' to save the Galway factory.
More nationalistic voices, including some in government, have been heard
questioning the dominant role being played by multinationals in Ireland's
industrial sector, and arguing that fewer tax and grant incentives should be
given to foreign companies and greater support given to indigenous Irish
industry.
More sober reflection by those not so close to the political front line,
though, view the Digital closure as part of an inevitable shake-out of an
industry facing rapid technological change.
Mr Edward Johnston, the director of the Federation of Electronic and
Informatic Industries in Ireland, said: 'We have to live with the fact of
occasional failures in terms of closures.'
Digital's Galway plant was primarily manufacturing VAX minicomputers. In
early 1992 it decided to start building its new Delta workstation around its
newly developed Alpha chip. According to industry sources, test marketing of
the Delta in Europe proved a failure, as PCs have increasingly come to
dominate the market over workstations and minicomputers.
As Digital had already begun PC manufacturing at Ayr, and had opened a new
semiconductor plant in Scotland, the concentration of production at Ayr
became inevitable.
Next to the food processing industry, electronics is Ireland's most
important manufacturing sector. Built up in just 25 years it now employs
17,000 people with a further 7,000 employed in software production and
development.
Net investment in fixed assets in the electronics sector amounts to IPounds
763m (Pounds 747m), which produces an annual output worth close to IPounds
5bn, of which 80 per cent is exported.
In the early 1970s, jobs in the industry were mainly in the basic assembly
of low-cost products. Today workers are involved in the production of
high-value systems, components and software.
According to the IDA, the government agency responsible for promoting inward
investment into Ireland, as much as 40 per cent of the 9,000 jobs in the
electronics sector in 1980 no longer exist. Nonetheless the sector has
experienced continuous growth, with high-tech plants replacing the older
assembly 'screwdriver plant' type operations, and demanding better trained
employees.
The past year has been one of even greater change. Last year, Wang, which
went into receivership, shed 75 per cent of its 700-strong workforce in
Ireland. Apple was on the point of putting off 400 of their 800 workforce,
but have since revised their decision.
By the end of 1993, in the space of two years, about 10 per cent of the
workforce in the existing electronics industry will have been made redundant
as a result of the Wang and Digital wind-downs and the closures of several
smaller companies.
Nonetheless this is being offset by new entrants such as Dell and Intel,
which are making major investments which within two years could boost the
sector's output by as much as 25 per cent. Dell decided to set up its sole
European manufacturing base Ireland just two years ago.
According to Mr Buddy Griffin, the managing director for manufacturing,
'there has been no cause for pain or regrets. On the contrary the operation
has been highly successful and facilitated very rapid growth in sales in the
European market.'
Intel is in the process of constructing a IPounds 500m semiconductor plant,
the biggest electronics investment ever in Ireland. The plant will
manufacture wafers for its new generation Pentium chip, otherwise known as
the 586 processor, and will be the company's main world manufacturing
facility for the processor, with sales projected at a level of 'billions of
dollars'. Some 1,500 jobs in total will be created at the plant.
Mr Frank Turpin, the external affairs manager at Intel, said the reasons for
choosing Ireland for this strategic plant were primarily due to the
workforce skills available and the 10 per cent corporation tax regime.
'Due to the complexity of the technology, we felt it had to be an English
language location, and in Scotland we felt we would face poaching by other
companies,' he said. Intel itself has poached 200 Irish engineers from other
electronics companies worldwide.
Mr Dan Flinter, the executive director for overseas industry at the IDA, is
in no doubt that, despite the setback of Digital's closure, the electronics
industry will continue to grow in Ireland. 'We shall continue to back strong
companies that want to locate here. We are in the business of applying
capital resources to get the best return, not necessarily the safest.'
It is not the most comforting message for the 780 who are to lose their jobs
at Galway, but as Mr Turpin said: 'There is a whole world of difference in
the industry now compared to when Digital came to Ireland.'

FT  02 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Japan to step up spending on LCDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO leading Japanese manufacturers of liquid crystal displays (LCDs) intend
to invest a total of Y160bn (Pounds 950m) over the next three years in moves
that could further widen the lead of Japanese LCD manufacturers over their
western competitors.
Sharp plans to invest Y80bn to expand its thin-film transistor plant in Nara
prefecture in the coming fiscal year, modernise a separate plant in Nara and
set up a plant in southern Japan which would begin production in 1995.
NEC, which is building a plant in Kagoshima, southern Japan, is investing
Y80bn in setting up a new thin-film transistor manufacturing plant, among
other things. Total investment by the company since 1989 would rise to
Y100bn by 1996, it said.
Sharp and NEC are expanding their LCD manufacturing capacity despite the
recession in the hope they can maintain leadership in a market which is
expected to grow to Y1,000bn by the next decade.
LCDs are used increasingly in portable computers, camcorders, car navigation
systems, electronic diaries and other communication devices.
The industry believes that with the growth in personal communication
devices, such as Apple's personal digital assistant which is scheduled for
launch this year, demand for LCDs will increase.
US and Europe have been left behind in the race to capture one of the
largest growth areas in electronics and western companies are dependent on
Japan for LCD supplies.
Philips, the Dutch electronics group, has joined Thomson and Sagem of France
in an LCD joint venture plant in an attempt to break into the market.
Philips already has a pilot plant in its home country. But LCD technology
requires many years of manufacturing experience and the Europeans are likely
to take some time to catch up.

acetic acid production plant at Wujing near Shanghai. The contract has been
awarded by China National Technical Import and Export Corporation for
Shanghai Chemical Industries.
Acetic acid is an intermediate chemical in the production of a range of
items, including paints and plastics. The process equipment for the plant
will be bought in Britain, says John Brown, responsible for engineering and
procurement for the plant, which is expected to start production in 1996.

<TEXT>
SENIOR Chinese and US officials yesterday focused on conditions for China's
entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade at talks in Beijing. It
was the highest level contact between the US and China since the change of
administration in Washington.
The US, whose negotiating team was led by Mr Douglas Newkirk, assistant
trade representative for Gatt affairs, has indicated support for China's
rejoining Gatt; but US officials say that the 'process of Gatt accession is
some way off'. China was a founding member of Gatt in 1948, the year before
the communists swept the US-supported nationalists from power.
Formal consultations between Beijing and Washington on Gatt accession -
China launched its bid to rejoin Gatt in 1986 - were suspended after the
1989 Tiananmen episode in which hundreds of democracy protesters died in an
army crackdown.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Phoenix of Beirut starts to rise from the ashes of civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIRUT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chic and wealthy young wives of east Beirut browse through the Coco
Chanel and French lingerie stores in the modern glass and steel ABC indoor
shopping mall, built after the end of the civil war.
After a busy morning buying expensive perfume, cosmetics and designer
clothes and enduring occasional power cuts the fashionable women eat a light
lunch together before zooming home in BMWs and Mercedes. On both sides of
the city, once divided by the killing zone known as the 'Green Line', a new
Beirut is rising from the debris of 15 years' fratricidal bloodshed.
Two years of peace and five months of government under billionaire prime
minister Rafik Al-Hariri has restored confidence to many Lebanese. The
government has started to reassert economic control and speeded a Dollars
5bn (Pounds 3.46bn) public and private reconstruction of the city. The
political situation remains volatile and the government faces a Herculean
challenge in financing its rehabilitation plans and stabilising an economy
awash with corruption, unemployment and poverty.
The armed sectarian militias which once mounted checkpoints and ran parts of
the city as fiefdoms have been cleared off the streets and replaced with the
Lebanese Army. Syrian troops still operate checkpoints, marked by pictures
of President Hafez al - Assad taken against a bouquet of red roses, but
their presence is more discreet.
Much of the business optimism is based on a belief in the miracles expected
from the government of Mr Hariri. Mr Michel Sinoura, finance minister, says
the government has already made substantial economic gains, particularly in
turning round the balance of payments deficit. The Lebanese pound has been
stabilised, despite a politically-motivated attack on the currency in late
January which was successfully fought off by a Dollars 300m Central Bank
intervention.
Mr Sinoura says big efforts are under way to slash a soaring budget deficit
of LPounds 1,200bn (Pounds 472m) last year by reducing expenditure and
improving revenue collection. Stabilising the macro-economic environment and
reforming an unwieldy and disintegrated public service are critical in
attracting the huge sums required to implement the government's
reconstruction plans. On the public sector side the government is trying to
speed implementation of a World Bank-backed Dollars 2.3bn three year project
for rebuilding and modernising the city's infrastructure.
Mr Al-Fadl Chalak, president of the Council for Development and
Reconstruction, says the CDR has just completed pre-qualification of tenders
for the Dollars 250m-Dollars 280m electricity rehabilitation and expects to
award the tender in July. All other projects are almost ready to go to
tender. However the CDR has so far received financing pledges for only
Dollars 400m. The rest may be raised at a Paris meeting of donors in April.
In the private sector, the second main thrust of the reconstruction project
is a controversial Dollars 3bn plan to rehabilitate 1.3m square metres,
including 660,000 square metres of private property, in the bombed-out
centre of Beirut.
While western diplomats say the economic plans and achievements of the
government are impressive, there are still serious contraints. Politically,
Mr Hariri is walking a tightrope between the different factions. The
Maronite-Christian community boycotted last year's elections because of the
continued presence of Syrian troops in Beirut in contravention of the peace
agreement hammered out in late 1989 in Taif, Saudi Arabia.
They remain suspicious of the increasing power of Mr Hariri, a Sunni Moslem,
at the expense of the presidency, which is reserved for a Maronite
Christian. Last month Mr Hariri clashed with President Elias Hrawi over
government appointments, marking the end of the political honeymoon.
Maronite businessmen, who have a large part of the estimated Dollars
30bn-Dollars 40bn held by nationals abroad, were accused of leading an
attack on the Lebanese pound in an effort to weaken the government. The
Kataeb, the Maronite political party, is also torn by an internal power
struggle.
Another problem is the continued power of the Islamic fundamentalist
Hizbollah, which is building its influence through charitable activities.
Curbing the Hizbollah and finding a political solution to Maronite
discontent are largely dependent on external factors. Hizbollah remains
almost untouchable while it heads the forces fighting against Israeli
occupation in the south of Lebanon.
The Maronites are unlikely to be reassured until the Syrians abide by the
Taif accord and redeploy all their 40,000 troops to Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.
Regaining Lebanese sovereignty will be critical to overcoming the looming
political problems and without it Mr Hariri will find his grand economic
ambitions much more difficult to achieve.

</HEADLINE>

   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Suharto of Indonesia yesterday opened the national assembly with a
promise to relax the 'iron grip' of government.
'We have been enjoying dynamic national stability for more than a quarter of
a century. Such stability cannot be maintained by an iron hand, regardless
of its strength,' he told the People's Consultative Assembly.
Government critics, who say the assembly itself reflects the government's
intolerance of democracy, greeted the speech with cynicism.
The 1,000-member assembly, which meets once every five years to elect
president and vice-president and discuss state policy, is certain to elect
the unopposed President Suharto for his sixth five-year term. General Try
Sutrisno, who last month retired as head of the armed forces, is expected to
be elected vice-president.
Although the assembly is the nation's highest body, it has never used its
power to initiate legislation and remains, critics say, beholden to the
president. Its membership consists of 500 members of the lower parliament -
which is dominated by Golkar, the governing party, and representatives of
the armed forces - and a further 500 people directly appointed by the
government.
The government also dissuades the assembly from using its right to vote,
arguing that agreement by consensus better reflects Indonesian values.
Members have been told not to disrupt the meeting.
'It's a pretence of democracy. Indonesia's got 180m people and we're all
being fooled,' complained one dissident former army officer.
Government supporters, however, say the assembly's support of the government
has been the bedrock for political stability and economic growth averaging 6
per cent over the past 20 years.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Canada becomes an Australian issue: Mulroney's tax policy
makes its mark on the election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S somewhat lacklustre federal election campaign came to life last
week on the day that Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, promised that a
re-elected Labor government would review the future of the monarchy. But it
was not Mr Keating's tepid republicanism which caught the public
imagination.
Paradoxically, Australians were more interested in the resignation of Mr
Brian Mulroney, Canada's Conservative prime minister, whose profile was
previously rather lower than that of the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team.
Mr Mulroney was catapulted into the campaign because he is associated with
the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST), the one issue which
could prove capable of preventing the election of a conservative
Liberal/National party government when Australians go to the polls on March
13.
Opinion polls suggest that Australian voters do not believe Labor's claims
that rapid economic growth will soon reduce unemployment, which peaked in
November at 11.4 per cent.
After a decade in power, Labor lacks credibility on economic issues, as
illustrated by the cool response to Mr Keating's economic statement at the
beginning of the campaign.
But many voters are also fearful of the opposition's tax proposals, raising
hopes among Labor advisers that a well-thought-out negative campaign may yet
enable the government to stave off defeat.
In line with this strategy, Mr Keating has dropped the statesmanlike style
he adopted at the beginning of the campaign in favour a brawling onslaught
on the proposed GST, which he describes as 'a monster'.
'This is not some small tax on the edge. The result will be that the
Australian lifestyle as we know it will change forever,' he warned in a
rowdy television debate with Mr John Hewson, the conservative leader.
Against this background, the upheaval in Ottawa was a heaven-sent
opportunity for Labor, which Mr Keating boldly exploited by asserting that
Mr Mulroney had been forced to quit by public anger about Canada's GST.
His explanation ignored the strains imposed on Canada by recession, high
unemployment, the North American Free Trade Agreement and Mr Mulroney's
failure to resolve Canada's constitutional problems.
It was also challenged by commentators with knowledge of Canada, who pointed
out that the conservative proposal forms part of a wide-ranging package of
tax reforms which make comparisons difficult.
Nevertheless, the anecdotal evidence of letters to newspapers and radio
talkback programmes suggests that the Mulroney factor has contributed to a
significant improvement in Labor support.
The latest batch of opinion polls, published yesterday, put Labor only 1-7
percentage points behind the conservatives, compared with 6-12 points a week
earlier.
The apparent success of Labor's anti-GST campaign presents a dilemma for Mr
Hewson, who has tried to make unemployment the main issue, but has been
unable to persuade voters that Australia's economic problems can be solved
by imposing a new tax.
The coalition's fight-back policy platform claims that a 15 per cent GST
would stimulate exports and help reduce Australia's long-term dependence on
foreign capital by encouraging domestic saving.
It also claims that most voters would be better off because the GST would be
offset by personal tax cuts and the abolition of seven indirect taxes,
including payroll tax, wholesale sales tax and petroleum excise tax.
But Mr Hewson knows that while a few thousand voters will read the platform,
many more may respond to Mr Keating's simpler warning that the GST will
increase the price of everything except basic foods by 15 per cent.
The result is likely to be a messy exchange of slogans in the last two weeks
of the campaign as the government tries to exploit its advantage on the
public relations battlefield where the election will be decided.
Tough campaigning comes naturally to Mr Keating, a master of the pithy
phrase, whose insulting labels for Mr Hewson include 'Dr Doom' and 'Gordon
Gekko' the fictional Hollywood businessman whose creed was 'Greed is Good'.
Mr Hewson attempted to win back the initiative yesterday with an attack on
Labor's 'secret taxes', such as the variable rate sales tax which is added
to the retail price of most consumer products.
He also showed that he is prepared to step up his own rhetoric in an attempt
to put the prime minister on the defensive in the last phase of the
campaign.
'He has got no plan, he has got no answers, all he has got left is a
negative scare campaign,' Mr Hewson told supporters in Sydney.

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA is ready to allow 100 per cent foreign ownership of power stations in
an attempt to tackle energy shortages caused by explosive economic growth, a
senior government official said, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Mr Zhou Heliang of the Ministry of Machinery and Electronics said China
would need to invest at least Yuan 50bn (Pounds 6bn) at 1993 prices in power
plants up to the year 2000.
Hong Kong companies have led the drive to build up China's power industry
but have done so by forming joint ventures with local partners to build and
run plants.
But Mr Zhou, who is director of the ministry's Department of Major Project
Equipment, said: 'We welcome foreign businessmen to China to build
wholly-owned power plants.'
In Hong Kong recently, he said power shortages were especially severe in
Shanghai, Beijing and Guangzhou. China's economy grew 12.8 per cent last
year, over twice the original target. Internal funds were insufficient to
boost power output.
'Premier Li Peng has said part of the market should be reserved for foreign
businessmen and they should be allowed to make profits,' Mr Zhou added.
But some analysts said foreign investors might well prefer to continue
working in joint ventures because Chinese partners have the influence needed
to cut through red tape.
Mr Allan Ng, of SG Warburg Securities, said Chinese infrastructure projects
could be profitable. But foreign companies should not bypass local partners
unless familiar with China.
Problems could arise if utility tariffs did not rise quickly enough.
'Setting up a wholly-owned subsidiary could be unfavourable while the
government regulates tariffs.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE housing starts, which have been one of the few bright spots in an
increasingly bleak economic landscape, may be slowing down, the country's
construction ministry reported yesterday.
The ministry said housing starts appeared to be entering a slowdown phase
after their strong growth in the second half of last year, with a 0.9 per
cent rise in January compared with the same month last year.
The slowdown is likely to add to pressure for the government to include tax
credits on housing in a special package to stimulate the economy.
The package is expected to be announced soon after the original budget for
1993 passes through parliament later this month.
For the past few months the strong growth of housing starts has been one of
the few straws in the wind that economic policymakers have pointed to as
evidence that the economy may not be heading for outright recession.
The marginal rise in housing starts in January followed a 5.4 per cent rise
in December. The construction ministry expects that housing starts for
February will be below the level of last year, particularly because fewer
houses for rent are being built.
Generally, however, the construction industry is starting to feel the full
force of the sharp increase in public works spending under the Y10,700bn
(Pounds 63bn) emergency spending programme announced last year. Orders
received by the country's top 50 contractors in January were 7.6 per cent up
on the year before, the first annual increase for nine months. The rise was
due to a 60 per cent jump in public sector demand.
The financial authorities hope this public spending will gradually feed its
way through into higher production in industries such as steel and
chemicals, which will in turn stimulate investment.
Consumer spending is likely to remain severely depressed however. Household
spending fell by 0.9 per cent in real terms in December, while new vehicle
registrations last month were 7.9 per cent down on last year, according to
the Japan Automobile Dealers' Association.
Isuzu Motor, which is pulling out of passenger car production, reported a 27
per cent drop in registrations.
Japanese companies' profits are likely to suffer a continuing squeeze,
according to official figures published yesterday which show that unit
labour costs rose by 8.5 per cent in the final quarter of last year and by
4.7 per cent in January.
Productivity was 7.5 per cent down in January on the year before.

Torture has become widespread and human rights violations have increased
dramatically since Algeria was placed under a state of emergency a year ago,
Amnesty International said yesterday, Reuter reports from London.
The human rights organisation said that since February 1992 more than 9,000
suspected Islamic activists had been held in internment camps in the desert
without charge or trial; 1,000 were still held.
About 300 people have been killed by security forces. Amnesty said a
significant number appeared to have been innocent bystanders deliberately
killed.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Interest rates to be cut in Australia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Australia's official interest rates are likely to be cut later this month
following an unexpected improvement in the current account deficit and a
rise in the value of the Australian dollar, Kevin Brown writes.
The Labor government and the conservative opposition parties both indicated
that the stronger currency clears the way for a cut in rates, whatever the
outcome of the federal election on March 13.
The Australian dollar closed just over one US cent higher at 70.27 cents
after the government statistical agency said the current account deficit
narrowed in January to ADollars 489m (Pounds 232m), seasonally adjusted. The
January figure was the lowest monthly deficit for five years.
The agency also issued revised monthly figures for the first six months of
the 1992-93 financial year which suggested that the full-year deficit will
be below the Treasury forecast of ADollars 17bn.
The announcement sparked a bond market rally which cut the yield on the
10-year bond to 7.75 per cent from 7.98 per cent. The yield on three-month
bills fell nine points to 5.41 per cent.
The last easing of monetary policy was in July, when the official cash rate
was reduced by 75 basis points to 5.75 per cent.

FT  02 MAR 93 / India plans more currency liberalisation soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL and R C MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI, BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDIAN government, which this week floated the rupee on foreign exchange
markets, is planning further currency liberalisation 'in the near future',
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said yesterday.
Mr Singh told a press conference he was considering ending restrictions on
the amounts of foreign exchange Indians could take out of the country for
travel and other purposes covered by the current account.
'We want to go for full current account convertibility in the near future,'
he said.
Mr Singh was commenting on the annual budget, which he presented on Saturday
and which contained wide-ranging economic reforms, including the
liberalisation of the rupee for trade-related transactions.
This involves the abolition of a system of dual exchange rates - a
free-market rate (last week about Rs31 to the US dollar) and an official
rate (Rs26 to the dollar).
By abolishing dual rates, Mr Singh hopes to boost business for exporters,
who can now exchange all revenues at market rates. However, the government
will have to pay more for imports.
The exchange markets were closed yesterday to give bankers time to consider
the changes. When dealings start today, Finance Ministry officials expect
the rupee to settle close to last week's free market rate.
Some foreign exchange dealers believe there could be wild swings in early
trading as dealers try to find a level for the currency. However, the
Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, has the right to intervene in the
market and its trading capacity is very large in comparison with that of the
commercial currency dealers. So it could dampen fluctuations it considered
excessive.
Meanwhile, Indian stock prices dropped sharply yesterday, following a
similarly precipitous decline on Saturday, as investors judged that the
budget fell short of their expectations.
The chief disappointment was the finance minister's failure to cut
corporation tax or capital gains tax.
The Bombay stock exchange's index of leading shares fell 81.22 to 2,571.18,
after losing 160 on Saturday.
The decline reflects investors' belief that a cut in corporation tax would
have been an immediate boost to profits. Industrialists, mostly having a
longer-term horizon, have reacted much more positively to a budget which has
brought big cuts in import duties and domestic sales taxes - moves which
give scope for increasing margins.
After the budget, the Finance Ministry must now prepare for negotiations
this month with the International Monetary Fund for a loan to help tide
India over any unexpected balance-of-payments problems.
The IMF, which is monitoring India's reforms, has supported the country so
far with a stand-by credit which expires at the end of the current financial
year this month. For next year, India hopes to negotiate exceptional
financing of about Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.76bn).
The 1993-94 budget includes measures welcome to the IMF, such as customs
duty cuts, a reduction in the fiscal deficit and financial sector reforms.
But Mr Singh has not gone as far as the IMF would wish. The government's
target for the fiscal deficit is 4.5 per cent of GDP, whereas the IMF would
like it to be under 4 per cent.
Mr Singh made clear yesterday he had gone as far with liberalisation as
political considerations allowed. 'The world has to accept that India is a
functioning democracy,' he said.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Beijing quashes HK voting role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG was yesterday given a glimpse of its future ruler's intentions
when a senior Chinese official ruled out publicly a role for Hong Kong in
determining arrangements for its 1994 and 1995 elections.
In so saying, Mr Lu Ping, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office
of the State Council (cabinet), made it plain that China's key concern with
Governor Chris Patten's proposals for greater democracy was not only with
their substance but the thought that the Legislative Council, the colony's
lawmaking body, might have a part in determining them.
In an impromptu but carefully scripted meeting with Hong Kong's media in
Beijing, Mr Lu said Britain would have to guarantee that Hong Kong's
Legislative Council go along with any Sino-British deal.
'If not, then you don't need to talk. What use is it?' he said.
Mr Lu, who by most accounts is well informed on Hong Kong matters, must know
that such a precondition to talks is one the British government and Mr
Patten could not agree to and is, indeed, impossible to guarantee.
As Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, said in an interview
published in Sunday's South China Morning Post: 'The constitutional position
is clear: the Legislative Council is responsible for enacting the
legislation for the 1994 and 1995 elections. We will stand by LegCo's
decision.'
Mr Lu must also have known that Mr Hurd's position was firmly based in
reality. In late 1991, LegCo threw out a deal that Britain and China had
made on the Court of Final Appeal - the court which will become Hong Kong's
highest appellate court after the colony reverts to Chinese sovereignty in
1997.
This issue still sits in limbo awaiting either renegotiation with China or a
change of heart in LegCo.
Hong Kong has been in thrall to daily reports of 'talks about talks'. They
have dominated local newspapers ever since Chinese officials leaked the news
that the two sides were discussing the possibility of dialogue three weeks
ago.
The stock market has taken heart ever since. Yesterday the blue-chip Hang
Seng index ended 46.83 points, or 0.74 per cent, higher at 6,398.82 - a
whisker short of its all-time high of 6,447 in November.
But as the 'talks about talks' drag on, China appears more and more to be
manoeuvring. A month ago Mr Patten's Executive Council, his highest advisory
body, signed off his proposed legislation without amendment. Only then did
China hint that it might be prepared to accept Mr Patten's offer of talks
made as far back as last October.
The past three weeks have been difficult for Mr Patten and his government
and have cast him on the horns of a dilemma. There is widespread support in
the community for Sino-British dialogue and Mr Patten does not want to be
seen as the party who scuppered talks before they had a chance of starting.
But the longer he delays the greater the risk he faces of losing the
momentum that has built up behind his proposals and the support he has in
the legislature and the community.
Last week, after his third delay in introducing the legislation into LegCo,
an adviser said Mr Patten had to go 'an extra mile' to show Britain's
sincerity in offering talks. But after Mr Lu's demarche yesterday, he may be
advised that it was 'a mile too far'.

FT  02 MAR 93 / President's grumbling strikes a chord: Brazilians love it,
but the business community and economists are wincing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Itamar Franco has Brazil's business community and economists
apoplectic, but his support among the public in general continues at levels
that most government leaders can only envy. When Mr Franco visited the
historic town of Olinda last week to watch the carnival celebrations he
received standing ovations. The latest polls show popularity ratings of 75
per cent.
Mr Franco seems to have struck a chord among the Brazilian people, who feel
long abused by profit-hungry businessmen and ministers with high-faluting
economic theories that have caused a three-year recession, soaring
unemployment and public debt, with no visible results in terms of reducing
inflation.
For many, his down-to-earth honesty and daily gripes have come as a welcome
change from the slick talk and glamorous ways of his predecessor Mr Fernando
Collor, who was accused of lining his pockets while talking austerity,
resulting in his impeachment.
Mr Franco, whose thick glasses give him a permanently bemused air, spends
his spare time taking his ministers to the circus or watching children's
movies like Home Alone 2. He apparently sees no contradiction in wanting low
interest rates, low inflation, higher wages and increased public spending
and believes that removing three zeroes from the cruzeiro - now 22,800 to
the dollar - would weaken it.
What traders have called 'the Itamar effect' - off-the-cuff comments on the
economy which send the markets plummeting - made its first appearance on the
day he took office. Mr Franco said he did not care what the markets in
Brazil or the bankers in London and New York thought, and that if foreign
bankers wanted to negotiate with Brazil they should learn Portuguese.
He woke his first economy minister up early in the morning, furious that an
increase in fuel prices had been authorised without his knowledge, and told
the press he would take charge of all tariff increases - a situation that
drove the head of Petrobras, the state oil company, to resign and pushed the
company into red.
Discovering that the price of his mouth ulcer cream had gone up, he declared
war on the pharmaceutical companies with a series of punitive measures
scaring off any potential foreign investment.
Criticising the price of cars, he offered incentives to the manufacturers to
relaunch the VW Beetle, causing dismay among richer Brazilians eager for the
country to start producing up-to-date models. A staunch defender of the
state, he suspended the privatisation programme and talked about renaming
the currency the cruzeiro forte - 'strong cruzeiro' - as if a simple change
in nomenclature could solve all Brazil's problems.
Each day a new comment has economists groaning. One trader said: 'Each
morning I take a deep breath before I look at the headlines to see the
latest from Itamar. He acts as if he is opposition rather than president.'
Most damaging of all have been his open attacks on his economy ministers. Mr
Gustavo Krause, the first, quit in December after being subject to a series
of criticisms from the president.
It is not clear how far Mr Franco's strategy is deliberate. Mr Pedro Motta
Veiga, director of the Rio-based Foreign Trade Foundation, says: 'I think
Itamar is just as much a marketing man as Collor.'
The marketing seems to work. Around the news-stands of Brazilian cities can
generally be found clusters of ordinary people murmuring in agreement with
the president's latest complaints, as if he himself bore no responsibility
for the country's problems.
But it is not clear how much longer Mr Franco's honeymoon with the public
will last. Yesterday the main Brazilian papers were preparing angry
editorials over the departure of Mr Paulo Haddad from the Economy Ministry.
His replacement, Mr Eliseu Rezende, may not allow himself to be made the
scapegoat for inflation in the same way as his two predecessors.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Insurers brace for NY bomb damage claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSURERS, including underwriters at Lloyd's of London, could face claims of
hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the weekend's bomb damage at
the World Trade Centre in New York City.
However, with considerable uncertainty surrounding the circumstances of the
claim, it is likely to be weeks before the industry can estimate the loss.
The New York Port Authority, which owns and operates the centre, has a
complex series of insurance policies covering both property and liability
claims, which is reinsured in the London insurance market.
London market sources last night doubted whether the policies would cover
damage caused by terrorists. However, lawyers acting for the Lloyd's
underwriters involved met Port Authority officials yesterday and last night
spoke of a 'spirit of co-operation' between the parties.
It was 'too early to tell one way or the other about coverage,' said Mr
Lawrence Pollack of New York lawyers LeBoeuff Lamb Leiby and MacRae, but the
Port Authority had a long history of placing insurance with Lloyd's, which
'values this business dearly'.
If claims do prove to be valid, it is understood that damage to the
building's fabric and interruption to business alone will generate
substantial losses.
Last year UK insurers and their continental European reinsurers paid Pounds
800m on property, interruption and loss of rental policies after the bomb
attack on the Commercial Union building in the City, a much smaller building
than the Trade Centre.
In New York legal actions - both from the wounded and relatives of the five
people killed in the attack, and potentially from commercial interests - are
expected to swell the total size of the loss.
Many of those caught up in the bombing might sue for compensation for
stress, possibly producing additional claims on other policies. 'This is one
of the most litigious cities in the world. It is a can of worms,' commented
one London broker.
On the Port Authority insurance programme, US companies would meet claims to
a limit of Dollars 400m (Pounds 282m). Above this Lloyd's underwriters would
meet all property claims up to an overall limit of Dollars 600m, through an
excess of loss reinsurance programme placed by CE Heath, the brokers.
These property damage policies would also typically cover losses through
business interruption.
Heath has also placed a reinsurance programme in London to provide Dollars
100m of cover for all liability claims above Dollars 4m. Below Dollars 4m,
all claims will be paid from the Port Authority's insurance programme.
Additional claims could also come from the building's tenants, which make
their own insurance arrangements to cover risks to property, business
interruption and liabilities.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Caribbean economic hopes rest with trading partners: Growth
in industrialised countries seen as vital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CANUTE JAMES

<DATELINE>
   KINGSTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CARIBBEAN countries can expect to improve on last year's sluggish economic
performance only if there is significant growth in the industrialised
countries, particularly in North America and Europe, according to the
Caribbean Development Bank.
In a review, the Barbados-based bank said the medium-term prospects were
also clouded by fears among the region's producers and exporters about the
impact of new trade blocs.
The bank said the weak economic performance of most of its borrowing members
last year 'reflected prolonged recession in their major trading partners and
tight fiscal and monetary policies as many countries sought to protect the
balance of payments contracting aggregate demand'.
The CDB, which has resources of Dollars 800m (Pounds 563m), provides project
loans for its 17 borrowing members. Its main contributors are the US,
Canada, Britain, France and Germany.
The bank reported that while some economies, such as Barbados and Dominica,
contracted last year, Guyana and Belize each grew by about 7 per cent.
Guyana's economy was buoyed by improved performance in all sectors except
bauxite, while there was expansion in agricultural output in Belize.
Other countries recorded growth below 4 per cent, the report said, with
Jamaica's performance aided by stabilisation of interest rates and the
slackening of inflation. Trinidad and Tobago suffered from a weak balance of
payments.
'The generally weak regional performance has contributed to mounting
unemployment, with several of the larger borrowing members reporting rates
in excess of 20 per cent.'
Tourism, increasingly important to many Caribbean economies, grew by 2 per
cent last year, with a decline in the North American market being
compensated for by an increase in the flow of visitors from Europe.
The fall in volume from North America was caused mainly by recession in the
US and Canadian economies, the bank said.
Favourable weather last year contributed to an increase in banana exports to
Britain, the CDB reported. But it warned that despite the European
Community's agreement on a new marketing arrangement to be implemented in
July, 'the future of this industry in the region appears relatively
uncertain'.
The region's sugar producers improved last year - with the exception of
Barbados - with output growing by 38 per cent in Guyana.
The bank reported, however, that the industry had been adversely affected by
a reduction in import quotas by the US.
Recession in the region's key markets dampened manufacturing output, while a
weak aluminium market depressed demand for bauxite produced in Jamaica and
Guyana. Falling oil prices and reduced production cut Trinidad and Tobago's
earnings from its petroleum sector.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Second economy minister quits Franco team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   MINAS GERAIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZILIAN economic policy was thrown into further confusion yesterday with
the resignation of Mr Paulo Haddad, the second economy minister in three
months to quit the government of President Itamar Franco.
Mr Haddad resigned after the president refused to grant him more time to
present an economic stabilisation plan and publicly criticised him for
failing to reduce spiralling inflation. Mr Gustavo Loyola, the governor of
the central bank, also resigned yesterday, along with the bank's entire
directorate.
Within hours Mr Franco named Mr Eliseu Rezende, head of the state-owned
electricity company Eletobras, as the new economy minister. Although not an
economist, Mr Rezende has a long history of public-sector experience.
Mr Haddad's decision heightened fears that the government would resort to a
shock economic plan, including a price freeze, in an attempt to bring down
inflation from current levels of 30 per cent a month. But a presidential
spokesman denied any economic shock plan was being considered.
Mr Antonio Delfim Neto, a congressman and former planning minister,
predicted an immediate rise in inflation. 'I think Itamar wants the best for
the country but just doesn't understand the significance of his actions,' he
said.
He added: 'How can anyone take us seriously when we are now on our eighth
economy minister since the start of civilian government in 1985? Instead of
the peace and caution we need, we are changing ministers quicker than the
movement of lovers through a motel.'
The news hit Brazil's financial markets as the country returned to work
after week-long carnival celebrations. The main Sao Paulo bourse dropped 6
per cent, before recovering to 4.6 per cent down after Mr Rezende's
nomination.
Mr Rezende, an engineer, was minister of transport during the military
regime of 1979-85. A friend of Mr Franco, he is from the president's home
state of Minas Gerais. He described himself yesterday as 'a soldier of
Itamar'.
Given Mr Franco's past interference in economic matters and his preference
for policies such as price freezes, Mr Rezende is expected to have
considerable difficulty attracting good economists to his team.
Mr Haddad said he had resigned not because of his failure to reduce
inflation but as a protest against political interference in the central
bank. Mr Franco wants to leave the nomination of central bank directors up
to Congress.
Mr Haddad's resignation coincided with the arrival in Braslia of a team from
the International Monetary Fund to assess the economy prior to negotiations
on a new accord, necessary for the closure of a deal with foreign creditors
to restructure Brazil's Dollars 44bn (Pounds 30.9bn) commercial debt. The
team is now expected to fly back to Washington.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Key index hints at slower US growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SLEW of figures yesterday pointed to a steady expansion of the US economy
but probably at a slower pace than the 4.1 per cent annual rate of growth
registered in the second half of last year.
The purchasing managers' index - a closely watched barometer of conditions
in manufacturing industry - fell to 55.8 per cent last month from 58.0 in
January. The dip mainly reflected a slower rate of growth of new orders,
which had soared to a nine-year high in January.
However, the index remained well above the 50 per cent level which is the
threshold for growth of the manufacturing sector.
Mr Robert Bretz, a spokesman for purchasing managers, brushed off the dip in
the index. He noted several encouraging signs, including the second highest
reading in five years of the association's production index.
The Commerce Department said personal incomes grew 0.5 per cent between
December and January following a 1 per cent increase in the previous month.
Personal consumption spending rose 0.3 per cent against a 0.8 per cent
increase in December. After allowing for inflation, however, real consumer
spending fell 0.1 per cent in January, a reaction to pre-Christmas spending.
However, officials said December incomes had been boosted by the bringing
forward of bonus payments in the securities industry, farm subsidies and
social security benefit payments. Excluding special factors, incomes grew by
only 0.3 per cent in December, less than in January.
The department also reported a 1.3 per cent decline in construction spending
between December and January, the first drop in five months.
Separately the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
existing homes fell 6.4 per cent between December and January, after
seasonal adjustment, against a revised 4.7 per cent gain in the previous
month. However, on an annual comparison sales were up nearly 15 per cent in
January.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Clinton moves on community service: Congress urged to act
quickly on pilot scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday unveiled a pilot scheme he hopes to develop
into a far-reaching national service programme with the impact of the GI
bill in the 1950s or the Peace Corps in the 1960s.
Mr Clinton asked Congress to act quickly on a summer initiative designed to
create a core group of about 1,000 leaders to spur community service
programmes around the country.
The pilot programme is intended to develop into a broader scheme to provide
loans for university education, to be paid off by community service, which
the president hopes will involve 100,000 people by 1997. He proposes that
participating graduates would undertake either one or two years of direct
community service, or repay the loans as a percentage of the graduate's
subsequent income.
The president's promise that 'in a Clinton administration everyone will be
able to get a college loan as long as they're willing to give something back
to their country in return' was one of his most productive themes during
last year's presidential campaign.
With tuition costs at US universities rising by an average of more than 10
per cent a year throughout the 1980s, the cost of higher education has
become a particularly daunting prospect for the middle-income families that
Mr Clinton targeted during the campaign.
Budget realities, however, have forced the new president to scale back some
of his ideas. The programme is now budgeted at Dollars 98m (Pounds 69m) next
year, climbing to Dollars 3.4bn in 1998, as part of a broader 'lifelong
learning' spending package totalling Dollars 37.8bn in 1994-97, compared
with Dollars 63.3bn spent over four years in Mr Clinton's campaign
manifesto.
The president said in an article in the New York Times on Sunday that his
national service programme would concentrate on providing young people to
work in schools, immunisation clinics, police forces and environmental
projects.
He argued, however, that the programme could have a wider impact on a whole
generation, as the Peace Corps created by President John Kennedy had for his
own generation.
'At its peak, the Peace Corps enrolled only 16,000 volunteers yet it changed
the way a generation of Americans look at themselves and the world,' Mr
Clinton wrote.
He was also due to present his national service scheme last night on a
special programme on MTV, the music video channel which last year became the
favourite means of targeting younger voters for both Mr Clinton and his
opponent, former President George Bush.

NICARAGUA'S President Violeta Chamorro is facing mounting protests against
her government's links with the leftist Sandinistas, her predecessors in
office, Reuter reports from Managua.
On Sunday about 30,000 protesters packed Managua's main plaza, many shouting
'Out] Out] Out]' at the mention of the president's name. The crowds arrived
by bus from the west of the country and from marches held in the capital.
The speakers, cheered on by the crowd, accused Mrs Chamorro of betraying
promises from the 1990 campaign, when she headed the 14 parties that formed
the National Opposition Union to defeat the Sandinistas.
No incidents were reported at the rally, organised by right-wing politicians
from the same coalition that elected Mrs Chamorro three years ago, but one
leader threatened to call for widespread civil disobedience against the
government.
A series of speakers urged Mrs Chamorro to dismiss her chief aide, Mr
Antonio Lacayo, and General Humberto Ortega, the Sandinista who stayed on as
chief of the defence forces.
A virulent attack on Mr Ortega by US Senator Jesse Helms was read out at the
demonstration.
Mr Helms, a North Carolina Republican, has helped delay US aid to Nicaragua
on the grounds that the Sandinistas wield too much power. The Sandinistas
won 42 per cent of the vote in the 1990 elections.
Mrs Chamorro has rolled back much of the Sandinistas' revolutionary
programme, established a largely free-market economy and widened the bounds
for political dis-sent.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Campbell sets pace in Canada succession race: The forceful
defence minister widely tipped to replace Brian Mulroney as prime minister
later this year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS taken less than two months for Ms Kim Campbell to make her mark as
Canada's defence minister. Foreign diplomats have already detected a more
forceful articulation of defence policy, ranging from a blunt affirmation of
Ottawa's contentious order for 50 European-built helicopters, to the
deployment of Canadian troops on a risky new mission in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The diplomats have also noticed that, since Ms Campbell took over the
portfolio in January, statements which used to be made by the chief of
defence staff now come from the minister's office.
Such evidence of decisiveness and ambition help explain why Ms Campbell  -
whose real first name is Avril - has quickly emerged as the front-runner to
succeed Mr Brian Mulroney as Canada's 19th prime minister.
Mr Mulroney announced his resignation last week but, as is normal in Canada,
will remain in office until his party holds a convention to choose a new
leader. The convention will probably be held in June, giving the new leader
no more than five months to prepare for the general election, which must be
called by November.
No one has yet stepped forward as an official candidate. For the moment all
those who may be in the running are taking the lie of the land, putting
together alliances and organisations, and scraping together the substantial
funds required for a leadership campaign.
Besides Ms Campbell, the candidates are expected to include Mr Perrin
Beatty, communications minister, and Mr Jean Charest, who holds the
environment portfolio. Mr Michael Wilson, the veteran trade minister, may
also throw his hat into the ring.
Each of these men appears, however, to have a weak spot.
Mr Beatty, who is in his early 40s, has been in parliament for 21 years but
is widely regarded as lacking substance. Mr Charest, 34, is bright,
personable and bilingual. But convention delegates, many of them from
western Canada, are unlikely to favour one Quebecker handing over the
leadership to another. Mr Charest will probably emerge from the convention
as a man to watch in the future.
Mr Wilson's seniority is offset by his plodding manner, his poor French and
his identification with the most unpopular policies of the Mulroney era,
such as free trade and the goods and services sales tax.
Early opinion polls indicate that, of all the prospective candidates, Ms
Campbell has the best chance of narrowing the gap which has opened between
the Conservatives and the opposition Liberals.
Before last week, the Liberals could count on the backing of about 45 per
cent of decided voters, against less than 19 per cent for the Conservatives.
But according to a Gallup poll taken shortly after Mr Mulroney's
announcement, the two parties would be almost neck-and-neck with Ms Campbell
at the helm. Mr Wilson was the second most popular choice.
Ms Campbell, who turns 46 next week, has the rare combination in Canadian
politics of being a woman from British Columbia who speaks fluent French.
She gained a reputation during three years as justice minister as an
intelligent, ambitious and forthright politician with a knack for pushing
legislation through parliament. 'She knows what she wants, but she's able to
work in a team and to convince people that she has the right solution,' says
Mrs Paule Gauthier, president of the Canadian Bar Association.
The UK government will have an opportunity to size up Ms Campbell when she
visits London later this month for talks with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, her
British counterpart.
Political observers say Ms Campbell's biggest handicap is an intellectual
aloofness. She studied Soviet government at the London School of Economics
(and speaks passable Russian), lectured in political science at the
University of British Columbia and, in her mid-30s, qualified as a lawyer.
Her hobbies include painting and playing the cello.
Opinions are divided on whether Ms Campbell can repeat Mr Mulroney's success
in persuading Quebeckers to vote Conservative; she is not well known in the
francophone province. The Tories have yet to cement the Quebec political
organisation crucial to victories in 1984 and 1988.
One favourite convention scenario is that Ms Campbell will emerge as the
winner, but with a Quebec 'lieutenant' at her side, perhaps Mr Charest or Mr
Benoit Bouchard, the popular health and welfare minister. But with three
months to go before delegates gather, no firm bets are being placed.

The campaign for France's two rounds of parliamentary elections on March 21

Seeking to minimise impending defeat, Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of the
ruling Socialists, said it was high time for the left 'to wake up' and for
the Socialists and environmentalists to get together to stem the 'tidal

Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, said yesterday that Britain
and France remained opposed to German membership of the United Nations
Security Council, Our Foreign Staff writes.
In a statement likely to fuel controversy within the EC, and for Chancellor
Helmut Kohl within his own government, he also said it would be
'unrealistic' to imagine the EC taking a seat on behalf of Europe in the
council. 'The United States says Germany should be on the Security Council,
but there are still two countries that are opposed - Britain and France,' Mr
Kinkel said at a privately sponsored conference on US-German relations,
according to Reuters news agency.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government and opposition agreed yesterday to set up an all-party
conference to negotiate a long-term energy policy, including a decision on
the future of nuclear energy in power generation.
The deadline for agreement has been set for the end of the year, before the
country faces a whole series of local, state and national elections in 1994.
However, there remain widespread doubts in the nuclear industry over whether
the political parties, ranging from the conservative Bavaria-based Christian
Social Union to the anti-nuclear Greens, will be able to agree on any
consensus. Apart from the future of nuclear energy, the conference will be
asked to propose a solution for the direct disposal or reprocessing of
nuclear waste, on which the political parties are deeply divided.
That question is vital to the long-term future of Britain's Thorp nuclear
waste reprocessing plant built by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) at
Sellafield, with which the German utilities have a 10-year reprocessing
contract.
The all-party talks, expanded to include representatives of the energy
producers and consumers, trade unions and environmental groups, will also
make recommendations on issues such as energy conservation and renewable
energy.

<TEXT>
SERB forces were yesterday close to seizing Cerska, the Moslem enclave in
eastern Bosnia which United Nations officials said was the target for the
first US air-drop.
Reports from Cerska said there was no evidence that any of the 21 tonnes of
food and medicine dropped by US air force C-130 aircraft were recovered
either by the 6,000 Moslems trapped in the area or by any of the other
parties to the conclict.
However, Mr Les Aspin US defence secretary, said the operation had been
successful, with many parcels landing in clear areas near Cerska. He added
it was believed the other parcels had landed in or near the drop zone.
Mr Aspin said the information was provided by national technical means,
which usually refers to aircraft or satellite photographs.
In Germany US troops prepared for a second air-drop but refused to say when
it would take place.
An amateur radio operator, Cerska's only link with the outside world, said
an object which could have been an aid pallet had been spotted behind
Serbian lines.
He suggested that the US aircraft might have mistaken Moslem villages set
alight during recent fighting for bonfires in the enclave.
Serb fighters at the weekend seized several villages in the Moslem area.
Artillery shells yesterday fell in the Drina valley as Serb forces fought
for control of more territory around Cerska. Western diplomats said the
outgunned Bosnia government forces in Cerska were unlikely to hold out much
longer.
The Belgrade office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees last night sent
two officials to the Zvornik area, just 10 miles away from Cerska, to
investigate reports of a likely outflow of Moslem refugees.
Local Bosnian commanders said that there were 1,500 wounded in Cerska and
that Serb fighters had set 10 villages on fire. Bosnian Croat forces said
yesterday they were enforcing a blockade of supply convoys for their
estranged Moslem allies despite Bosnian government reports that it had been
lifted, Reuter reports from Zvornik. The Bosnian Croat militia force said it
was halting about half of the Moslem forces' traffic between the Croatian
border and central Bosnia.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Rome moves to restore political confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian justice minister announced an initiative late last night aimed
at restoring confidence in the country's political system, which has been
battered by a widening corruption scandal.
Mr Giovanni Conso said after a cabinet meeting that the government would on
Friday unveil measures to 'restore legality' and ensure swift and simpler
justice for corruption suspects. For many, this would apparently mean
avoiding jail.
Mr Conso said: 'We all feel how grave the situation is and there is a deep
yearning for renewal. You can feel it in the air. We are surrounded by it. .
. The country wants to turn over a new page and honest politicians must give
it a chance. We must clean up every sector of our community from these worms
which have undermined our democracy.'
The government package will be reviewed at a cabinet meeting on Thursday.
Rome's apparent intention is to ensure that public life is not paralysed by
the scandals and to put some of the most common crimes beyond the reach of
prosecutors. A growing number of senior political and business leaders have
been implicated in corruption.
Mr Conso said those who confessed and immediately paid back ill-gotten gains
could request suspended jail sentences, he said. Other punishments, however,
would also await them.
Mr Conso said measures being discussed included barring politicians
convicted of corruption from holding elected office. Businessmen found to
have paid bribes would face unspecified 'commercial sanctions' and public
administrators who took them would be excluded from jobs in the public
service.
The minister said that a new law on political party funding was needed but
that the government wanted parliament to take the lead.
Earlier yesterday, a former official of the Italian Communist party (PCI)
was arrested by Milan magistrates on suspicion of operating a Swiss bank
account to receive pay-offs from contracts in the power industry.
Mr Primo Greganti, an official in the Turin branch of the PCI during
1970-87, voluntarily appeared for questioning in Milan yesterday and was
later arrested for alleged corruption and illicit financing of the party. It
is the first time Italian companies have been linked to alleged payments to
the PCI made illicitly outside the country.

A FURTHER round of Balkan peace talks opened at the United Nations
yesterday, with UN and EC mediators due to hold separate meetings with the
three main parties.
A spokesman for Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen voiced optimism that all
parties to the conflict would be brought together before the end of a
'crucial' week.
Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader who came to New York on Sunday
ignoring the threat of a human rights lawsuit, was the first to call on the
mediators. Mr Mate Boban, the Bosnian Croats' leader, made an appointment
and Bosnian president Alija Izetbegovic sent a message he was leaving
Washington for New York and would be available for a meeting last night. UN
officials were elated the talks were under way after more than three weeks.
Mr Fred Eckhard, spokesman for the mediators, said they 'continue to feel
they have the three parties close to agreement, and with sufficient leverage
applied by governments day to day, it could be wrapped up'. If the parties
left New York later this week without agreement it could be hard getting
them together again.

FT  02 MAR 93 / E Europe expects more from EBRD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, set up two years ago
to promote economic development in eastern Europe, ploughed only Ecu200m
(Pounds 165m) into the region during 1992, though the bank's lending is
expected to increase sharply this year.
Agreement was reached during 1992 to invest Ecu1.2bn in projects in eastern
Europe, and commitments of a further Ecu2.6bn are expected this year, the
EBRD revealed as it announced its annual results.
The slower disbursement of cash reflected the length of time taken to
implement projects, said Mr Anders Ljungh, vice-president for finance.
Commitments made so far show a bias towards economically and politically
more stable states such as Poland and Hungary, rather than the former Soviet
Union.
Poland and Hungary account for 44 of the 71 projects approved by the EBRD so
far. The Russian Federation, by comparison, accounts for just eight, with
less capital committed than to Romania and the Czech and Slovak republics.
'We've done less than we should (in the former Soviet Union), particularly
as it accounts for over half of our operations,' said Mr Ljungh.
A number of large projects are currently under discussion in the former
Soviet Union, including energy projects requiring capital of Dollars 5.5bn
in all. The bank has been presented with 'fewer good projects than we would
have liked', said Mr Ljungh.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Gonzalez faces call for early poll: Spain's economic woes
herald unofficial start of election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish parliament is to hold an emergency debate on unemployment today.
It will pit Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez against his increasingly
confident conservative opponent, Mr Jose Maria Aznar, in what Spaniards
assume will be the unofficial start to a long 1993 election campaign.
With polls showing Mr Aznar's Partido Popular (PP) rapidly gaining on Mr
Gonzalez's Socialists, unemployment at a record 21.06 per cent and business
failures at historic highs, today's debate promises to be one of the most
acrimonious in the 10 years that the Socialists have held power.
Mr Gonzalez has to hold an election by the end of November and is anxious to
delay for as long as possible.
As a first effort to put a brake on his party's declining popularity, he
will today put forward a Pta300bn (Pounds 1.8bn) emergency economic package,
agreed in cabinet last Friday.
It aims to accelerate infrastructure spending, ease small business taxes and
increase the statutory length of temporary job contracts to slow
unemployment growth.
The European Community will fund 80 per cent of the package, Madrid hopes,
and thus limit its impact on the tight 1993 budget.
But this is the first time opponents such as Mr Aznar and the leader of the
communist Izquierda Unida (IU), Mr Julio Anguita, find themselves
approaching an election with the economy in recession. These men believe
that they are about to end Socialist party dominance in Spain, and will
demand early elections.
Mr Gonzalez is unlikely to do them that favour, but pressures on the
government are immense.
Unemployment is expected to continue to rise until the summer and, with both
the business community and the opposition calling for Spain to float the
peseta, cut interest rates and raise spending, the currency may see a
turbulent period in the markets. Meanwhile, industrial production figures
published yesterday showing a 5.6 per cent fall in December 1992 against the
same month in 1991, and a 1.7 per cent fall in overall output in 1992, are
likely to sharpen calls for drastic action to revive the economy.
Despite persistent rumours, however, it is most unlikely that the government
would unilaterally take the peseta out of the exchange rate mechanism.
Signs that German interest rates may soften soon will probably make it
easier for the Spanish to cut rates.

two most powerful republics, could make a lasting deal elusive.
Further evidence of tension between the two emerged yesterday, with Ukraine
rejecting the call by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, for Russia to
be given a free hand by the international community, especially the United
Nations, to 'guarantee peace and stability' throughout the former territory
of the Soviet Union.
Mr Mikola Mikhailchenko, chief political adviser to Mr Leonid Kravchuk,
Ukraine's president, said: 'Ukraine will never recognise that Ukrainian
territory is a sphere of special Russian interest . . . we want relations of
equality.'
In addition, Mr Leonid Kuchma, the Ukrainian premier, accused Russia of
imposing an economic blockade on Ukraine. He saw no alternative but to shift
trade between the neighbours to world prices.
'No matter how much we try to negotiate with Russia over prices, we have
realised that we cannot escape world prices. But we, in turn, will insist on
world prices,' the prime minister said.
Ukraine has threatened to charge transit fees at international rates for
exporting the Russian gas which goes through Ukraine's pipelines. This
amounts to 93 per cent of Russia's total foreign sales.
This was in response to Russia's threat to cut off all gas supplies over
Ukraine's gas debt to Russia. Moscow told Ukraine earlier this year that it
would charge world prices for gas from February 1.
By contrast, republics such as Belarus and Kazakhstan, which have retained
close political links with Russia, appear confident in restoring economic
ties as well. However, political rebels such as Georgia said they were in
the same position as Ukraine.
'We must speak of an economic blockade,' said Mr Tengiz Sigua, the Georgian
premier. 'Russia is not supplying us with anything at all.'
The comments of the leaders of the former Soviet states appear to indicate
that Russia, in the grip of continuing economic crisis, is now determined
overtly to reward its friends and punish those with which it has strained
relations.
Russia expects to produce between 340m-347m tonnes of oil this year, down
from 395m tonnes in 1992. The Surgut meeting represents an effort to
re-establish these links in the oil and gas sector by creating a 'mini-Opec'
to co-ordinate investment and production.
Mr Yuri Shafranik, Russian fuel and energy minister, warned that unless the
republics co-operated, oil production might be insufficient by 1995 to meet
even Russia's own requirements. Mr Shafranik hoped the non-Russia republics
would contribute up to Rbs700bn to the Siberian oil industry in exchange for
a guaranteed supply of cheap fuel.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Collapse of bribery edifice traps corporate Italy: As more
construction company executives are caught in the investigation net, Robert
Graham examines the impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A QUICK glance down the list of businessmen involved in Italy's ever
expanding corruption scandal reveals a common thread: almost without
exception they are connected with the construction business.
This has been underscored by the latest batch of arrests that include Mr
Giampiero Pesenti, the Italian cement baron, and Mr Francesco Paolo
Mattioli, chief financial officer of Fiat, in his capacity as president of
the group's civil engineering arm, Cogefar-Impresit.
At least nine of the leading 15 construction groups in Italy are involved in
the inquiries relating to illicit funding of political parties. Apart from
Cogefar-Impresit, the country's largest private group, these include
Ferruzzi's Calcestruzzi, Mr Salvatore Ligresti's Grassetto, and the family
groups Lodigiani and Belelli.
Nor is it a coincidence that Mr Giovanni Prandini, a former Christian
Democrat minister of public works, has been caught in the corruption
investigations. Tendering for public works contracts, worth more than
L30,000bn (Pounds 13.7bn) a year, lies at the heart of the magistrates'
countrywide investigations. The politicians have allegedly been taking
kick-backs in return for either rigged contract bids or providing favoured
treatment to the bidding consortia.
But as more executives and owners are caught in the magistrates'
investigative net, the impact is increasingly being felt on company
decision-making processes, their balance sheets, and company reputations.
'We are particularly concerned about the impact this will have on the
reputation of Italian contractors abroad,' commented a spokesman for Ance,
the Italian construction association.
In the case of state-run entities where management has been arrested or
placed under investigation, the decision-making process has been especially
slowed. At Anas, the state roads authority which accounts for 10 per cent of
the annual value of public works contracts, the entire board has been
decapitated by a corruption investigation. Another victim of closer judicial
scrutiny is the prospective L30,000bn worth of contracts in prospect for the
development of a high-speed rail network which was to be the mainstay for
the contractors in the mid-1990s.
But the main worry of company owners is the paralysis in public
administration caused by the scandals. According to one building company
proprietor: 'No decisions are being taken: everyone - from the local
councils, through to the regional councils and ministries - is terrified of
putting their signature to a document for fear of being accused of
corruption.'
If it is not a case of bureaucrats being afraid, public works contracts are
being delayed because of the collapse of city administrations. Currently
Italy's four main cities - Milan, Naples, Rome and Turin - have no councils,
thanks to the scandals.
Mr Francesco Merloni, the public works minister, readily admits that he
himself has blocked a large number of contracts, especially road works,
because the ministry he inherited eight months ago had awarded so many
contracts by private tender. Almost two-thirds of all public works
contracts, including those in transport, during the 1980s were awarded by
private tender or by methods which ignored established guidelines, according
to a recent report by Censis, the research institute.
The minister has few illusions about the extent to which the contracting
business was subject to abuse. Bidding was uncompetitive; cartels among
different contractors were common, and contracts were frequently awarded to
shell companies. It was also difficult for the government to keep tabs on
the companies. Some 15,000 had the formal qualifications to bid for
contracts and 12,000 public bodies could award construction contracts.
Officials estimate that the real value of contracts was inflated by at least
15 per cent to accommodate 'commissions' and extra profits. Another tactic
was to halt work in mid-contract to renegotiate the price. These practices
help to explain why Italy spends 4 per cent of GDP - close to the EC average
 -on infrastructure yet has comparatively poor networks of modern roads,
railways, urban transit systems and ports.
The paralysis in bureaucratic procedures affects not only public works
contracts. Ance maintains the civil service's fear of being investigated for
corruption is also holding up private sector activity, which accounts for 52
per cent of the construction business.
The problems arising from corruption scandals are compounded for the
construction business by the state of the economy. The economy moved into
recession in the second half of 1992 and some 100,000 jobs were lost. Since
last July the government of Mr Giuliano Amato has cut back pubic spending to
hold down the public sector deficit. In the last half of 1992, the value of
public works contracts put out to tender dropped 27 per cent in real terms
compared with the same period the previous year. The 1993 budget has cut out
L11,200bn of expenditure, a reduction of almost 30 per cent.
The drop in spending has been accompanied by a corresponding rise in unpaid
contracting debts.
Contractors are currently owed a staggering L11,000bn which is being covered
by short-term finance at punitive rates of 20 per cent. One positive
development of the scandals has been the drafting of a new law governing
tenders, subjecting them to greater transparency and scrutiny. Mr Merloni
also believes Italy will in future be in a better position to comply with EC
regulations on tenders and bidding. This in turn should guarantee greater
competitiveness, both between domestic companies and with outsiders.
Increased competition, combined with the bleak economic climate, is expected
to encourage more mergers and force many small operators to disappear. The
problems produced by the corruption scandal are also obliging conglomerates
like Fiat or Ferruzzi to question whether they need to maintain a presence
in the construction business.
Fiat's Cogefar-Impresit is the largest private construction group, itself
the product of a series of mergers, but it is not central to the core
business of the automotive sector.
Mr Silvio Berlusconi, the media magnate, recently claimed he had pulled out
of the construction business more than a decade ago because it was too
wrapped up with politics at all levels.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government and opposition agreed yesterday to set up an all-party
conference to negotiate a long-term energy policy, including a decision on
the future of nuclear energy in power generation.
The deadline for agreement has been set for the end of the year, before the
country faces a whole series of local, state and national elections in 1994.
However there remain widespread doubts in the nuclear industry over whether
the political parties, ranging from the conservative Bavaria-based Christian
Social Union to the anti-nuclear Greens, will be able to agree on any
consensus.
Apart from the future of nuclear energy, the conference will be asked to
propose a solution for the direct disposal or reprocessing of nuclear waste,
on which the political parties are deeply divided.
That question is vital to the long-term future of Britain's Thorp nuclear
waste reprocessing plant built by British Nuclear Fuels (BNFL) at
Sellafield, with which the German utilities have a 10-year reprocessing
contract.
The all-party talks, expanded to include representatives of the energy
producers and consumers, trade unions and environmental groups, will also
make recommendations on energy conservation, use of renewable energy, plans
for the future use of fossil fuels, and for a common European energy policy.
Pressure for such an 'energy consensus' has come from Germany's leading
power utilities, including RWE, Veba and Bayernwerk, which have been
demanding clarity from the government and opposition over the future of
nuclear energy, which now provides about 34 per cent of Germany's
electricity supply.

<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first Anglo-Spanish ministerial meeting in two years on the future
status of Gibraltar ended yesterday without significant progress.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary said 'difficulties remain but
we have charted a possible way forward.' Mr Javier Solana, Spain's foreign
minister, said: 'We have taken a small step but one in the right direction.'
Officials from the two countries are to hold further talks in the coming
months in the hope of arranging another ministerial meeting before the end
of the year. Summing up yesterday's events, Mr Hurd said: 'We have been
talking essentially about procedures for possible talks about matters of
substance in the future.'
At the centre of the Gibraltar dispute lies Spain's claim of sovereignty
over the three-mile long peninsula that lies at its southern tip, and
Britain's commitment to stand by the enduring opposition among the colony's
20,000 inhabitants to any deal with Spain.
Mr Solana restated his policy mix of 'persuasion and pressure' which aims at
waking Gibraltarians up to the realisation that 'their best interests lie in
the normalisation of the situation' - this being Madrid's code for progress
towards returning the Rock to Spain.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE campaign for France's two rounds of parliamentary elections on March 21
and 28 officially opened yesterday, with more than 5,000 candidates
contesting 577 seats, reflecting the rise of fringe parties and incomplete
electoral pacts between certain mainstream parties, writes David Buchan in
Paris.
Seeking to minimise impending defeat, Mr Laurent Fabius, leader of the
ruling Socialists, said it was high time for the left 'to wake up' and for
the Socialists and environmentalists to get together to stem the 'tidal
wave' forecast for the centre-right opposition.
A CSA poll published yesterday predicted that the RPR-UDF opposition parties
would get 38.5 per cent of the popular vote, translating into an enormous
majority of 424-436 seats out of the total of 555 for mainland France. It
put support for the Socialists and their minor allies at 20 per cent, giving
them 91-98 seats, and backing for the two environmentalist parties at 17 per
cent, translating into only 2-8 seats.

FT  02 MAR 93 / EC urged to bring car taxes into line

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission should take 'political action' to harmonise car
taxes in EC member states, according to European carmakers, writes Andrew
Hill in Brussels.
ACEA, the European automobile manufacturers' association, says wide
disparities in car tax 'constitute the single most important cause of car
price differences in the EC, maintaining low pre-tax levels in high taxation
countries'.
An ACEA study of car taxes across Europe reveals that the overall level of
tax on an average 2-litre car in the EC varies from 15 per cent in
Luxembourg and Germany to 213 per cent in Denmark. 'Apart from being
contrary to the philosophy of the single market, these discrepancies
obviously cause distortion in the cross-border movement of new motor
vehicles,' ACEA says.
EC legislation has set minimum levels of value added tax across the
Community, and cut higher VAT rates, but it has not affected additional
sales and registration taxes in some member states.

A Nato-style military structure could emerge from talks between former
Soviet states on closer military integration, a common defence industry and
a common draft, writes John Lloyd.
Six members of the Commonwealth of Independent States have agreed to closer
integration, but differ on how an integrated military should be structured,
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, CIS forces commander, said yesterday. The six
states are Russia and Armenia, with the four central Asian states of
Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE Theodore Roosevelt, the reformist US president at the turn of the 20th
century, Mr Dieter Wolf speaks softly but carries a big stick.
After six months in office, Mr Wolf, the new president of the Federal Cartel
Office, Germany's anti-trust authority, has started to spell out his views
on the future of EC competition policy. His thoughts may disappoint those in
Brussels who saw the 1990s as a decade of expansion of EC powers at the
expense of member states.
Speaking in his office in Berlin, Mr Wolf makes clear that Germany's
attitude to EC competition policy mirrors the Bonn government's views on the
evolution of the EC as a whole. There is, he argues, a need for more
openness in decision-making, more accountability and, in some cases, more
devolution of power to member states.
The European Commission is nearing the end of a wide-ranging review of its
September 1990 merger rules. Already Germany, along with the UK and France,
have indicated that they will resist moves to lower the turnover thresholds
above which the EC's competition watchdogs automatically investigate deals
affecting the EC market.
EC officials said yesterday the Commission remained 'neutral', but Mr Wolf
says lowering the current threshold of Ecu5bn (Pounds 4.13bn) is premature.
He is pushing for other reforms, mainly clarity on how and why decisions in
Brussels are made, noting that the Commission is not obliged to set out in
writing the reasons for competition decisions. True, the Commission does
produce a short summary, but in nowhere near the detail of the UK's
Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
He says: 'Inevitably there is some political colouring because of the need
to have a majority in the Commission. Inevitably, there is the suspicion of
a fix.'
Because Germany's competition credentials are stronger than most in the EC,
Mr Wolf jokes about a two- or three-speed Europe, with Germany, Denmark, the
Netherlands and the UK in the fast lane. Thus, it is also premature to talk
up the prospects of a new EC-wide competition authority independent of the
Commission: 'It won't probably happen before the end of the century.'
Harmonising the varying competition laws among member states could take even
longer, even if this means a delay in a true single market.
Instead, Mr Wolf would like greater clarity in procedures for vetting
cartels and abuse of a dominant market position, under Articles 85 and 86 of
the Treaty of Rome.
At present, he estimates some 200 cases are outstanding in Brussels, and the
number is expected to rise because of the single market.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Low pound may push up interest rates, Bank warns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN WOULD raise interest rates if it felt a falling pound imperilled its
goal of low inflation, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of
England, warned last night.
Speaking in Bristol, Mr Leigh-Pemberton insisted that the Bank was 'in no
way indifferent' to the behaviour of the exchange rate and stressed that the
UK had 'most certainly not been seeking a competitive advantage' for its
exports through sterling's depreciation.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton, who is to retire at the end of June, said the
'substantial fall' in sterling's value since its departure from the European
exchange rate mechanism in September 'was not a deliberate object of
policy'.
Although sterling gained 3 1/2 pfennigs against the D-Mark to close in
London at DM2.37, its value measured on the Bank's trade-weighted exchange
rate index was 15.2 per cent lower than before leaving the ERM.
The governor warned that continued success in pursuit of the government's
target of keeping underlying inflation within a 1-to-4 per cent band during
the life of this parliament 'could be impaired if the exchange rate were to
fall too far'.
Giving his clearest warning yet of higher interest rates in the event of a
further sterling slide, he said: 'We will need to monitor very carefully the
impact of the exchange rate on inflation and to respond with tighter
monetary policies if we believe the inflation target to be threatened.'
As money markets throughout Europe yesterday looked forward to an easing of
German monetary policy, Mr Leigh-Pemberton made clear that Britain would not
follow any cut in interest rates.
'In such circumstances, there would be no question of the UK seeking to hold
the exchange rate down to maintain competitive advantage,' he said. 'Indeed,
the appreciation of the (sterling) exchange rate which would result from
easier policies elsewhere would greatly assist the achievement of the
government's target for reducing inflation.'
The governor's remarks came only hours after provisional Bank figures for
M0, the narrow measure of money supply, pointed to a continuing upturn of
British retail sales last month. The sharp seasonally adjusted 4.8 per cent
year-on-year increase of M0 in February was well above the government's
0-to-4 per cent target.

MR JOHN BIRT, the director-general of the BBC, yesterday backed down and
decided that he would become an employee of the Corporation for the first
time, six years after joining as deputy director-general.
Mr Birt's change of status follows revelations that he had been paid during
his time at the BBC through a private company, John Birt Productions.
After a meeting yesterday with Lord Barnett, the vice-chairman of the BBC
governors, Mr Birt said in a statement: 'The argument has been strongly made
in the past few days that it is inappropriate for the director-generalship
to be occupied by someone who is not an employee of the BBC.
'I recognise the force of that argument. And I have today told the BBC I
would like to accept their offer to change my status and to become a member
of the BBC's staff.'
On Sunday, the BBC was still publicly defending Mr Birt's role as a
'freelance' with his own service company and a senior governor made it clear
no pressure would be brought on Mr Birt from the governors to change his
mind.
The news of Mr Birt's change of heart comes as further information became
available about the private companies of other senior broadcasters, who
have, like Mr Birt, worked or still work at London Weekend Television. Such
arrangements are legal and have been accepted by the Inland Revenue.
Ms Janet Street-Porter, head of youth and entertainment features at the BBC,
has her own private company, Janet Street-Porter Limited. Ms Street-Porter
is not on the staff of the BBC and money from her contract is paid to her
private company. The company had a turnover of Pounds 94,256 last year,
although that would include other freelance earnings.
The BBC refused to discuss the details of Ms Street-Porter's contract last
night. Ms Street-Porter said she had been a freelance for over 20 years
including broadcasting, writing books, journalism, television presentation
and television production. She said her BBC contract ran out at the end of
last year and a new one was being negotiated.
The BBC emphasised yesterday that no other member of the current board of
management, apart from Mr Birt until now, was paid on a freelance basis.
However, Mr Jonathan Powell, until recently controller of BBC 1, was never
on the staff of the BBC.
LWT confirmed yesterday that four executives have been paid in part through
private companies. They are Mr Marcus Plantin, the former director of
programmes who now is director of the ITV network, Mr Greg Dyke, chief
executive of LWT, Mr Barry Cox, director of corporate affairs, and Mr Brian
Tesler, former managing director. Mr Dyke's company, Vine Productions, had a
turnover of Pounds 52,810 in 1991.
The BBC said yesterday that following Mr Birt's appointment as
director-general, the Corporation 'preferred new arrangements for the post
of director-general. These have now been agreed and John Birt will become an
employee of the Corporation'.
It is not clear if Mr Birt will be compensated for the fact that he will not
be paid gross in future and is likely to have to pay more tax. The BBC
refused to discuss details of his new contract.
In his statement, Mr Birt said his particular arrangement had been agreed
with the Inland Revenue. 'I have always been entirely open about the basis
on which my services are provided,' he said.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Scottish bank offers bonuses for charging customers more
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GAPPER and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Scotland was yesterday criticised by the Labour party for
introducing an incentive scheme which offers bonuses to employees who
increase the number of account charges levied on customers.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer spokesman, said the Performance Plus
scheme was 'the last straw for many small businesses'. He said it undermined
banks' claims to treat customers sensitively, and on an individual basis.
The Royal Bank scheme, introduced on a trial basis from February to April,
sets a target for each branch to raise its collection of ancillary charges
such as those levied for returning 'bounced' personal and business cheques.
Each branch has a second target to increase the number of customers opening
savings accounts. Employees at a branch which meets one of the two targets
will receive Pounds 40 a quarter, and those at a branch which meets both
will get Pounds 100.
All retail banks have been trying to raise income from account charges and
other fees to compensate for high bad debts. Royal Bank raised its
commission and fee income by 23 per cent to Pounds 391m in the year to last
September.
Mr Griffiths called on Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
to investigate banks' charges. The call followed an attack on banks'
treatment of small businesses last month by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow
chancellor. Banks have figured heavily in Labour's recent attacks on the
government for protecting the vested interests of big business.
Using a parliamentary early day motion, Mr Griffiths urged Lord Younger,
Royal Bank's chairman and a former cabinet minister, to end the scheme. He
said many businesses and individuals were already unable to meet bank
charges.
Mr Tony Schofield, Royal Bank's managing director for branch banking, said
the scheme was the first attempt by the bank to provide incentives to
clerical staff to meet business targets similar to those already in place
for managers.
Mr Schofield said the bank was not curtailing managers' discretion. 'We want
to curtail acts of omission by staff who fail to apply standard charges
because of a busy daily schedule,' he said.
The bank had identified a 'significant amount of leakage' due to staff
failing to impose standard charges. Mr Schofield said some of these charges
were levied by computer at other banks, and might also be at Royal Bank
within two years.
Mr Sandy Boyle, assistant secretary of the Banking, Insurance and Finance
Union, said Performance Plus was 'an ill-conceived scheme' which would
create tension between Royal Bank's 13,500 branch staff and its customers.
Banks have placed more emphasis on collecting fees and charges on personal
accounts because the fall in base rates has reduced earnings from such
accounts. Royal Bank does not charge customers who remain less than Pounds
100 overdrawn.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Break-up of British Gas urged: Watchdog wants division into
12 regional companies to reduce domestic prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CALL for the wholesale break-up of British Gas as a way of reducing prices
for household customers came yesterday from the industry's regulator.
The radical proposals to introduce more competition have plunged the
relationship between the company and Sir James McKinnon, director-general of
the industry watchdog Ofgas, to a new low. British Gas called his
suggestions 'a smash and grab raid' on its business that would cost Pounds
3bn over 10 years.
The proposals call for British Gas to be broken into 12 regional marketing
companies with a separate gas purchasing arm. The regional companies would
not have British Gas's current monopoly over domestic supply, opening up the
market for rivals.
The regulator, who has waged a battle of attrition against British Gas's
market power, wants the break-up in addition to hiving off the company's
pipelines and storage system. 'It's a logical development,' Sir James said.
'If there is any desire to give domestic customers some kind of choice, this
is the route to go.'
He believes that more choice will lead to lower prices. 'It must be for
customers themselves to decide how much they want to pay for the kind of gas
supply services they require,' he said.
Sir James's proposals were made in a submission to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission and released to the public yesterday. The commission is
reviewing the structure of the gas industry after previous rows, and is due
to make its report next month.
Mr Cedric Brown, chief executive of British Gas, who was yesterday giving
evidence to the commission on why the company should not be broken up,
predicted that Sir James's proposals could lead to price increases of up to
15 per cent.
He called the proposals 'superficial and poorly argued', and questioned 'the
irresponsibility of a body that is supposed to be responsible'.
British Gas said that to dismember its business would cost Pounds 166 on
average for each customer as well as Pounds 1,500 per shareholder, although
it gave no indication as to how the costs would break down. The company also
said the industry would face disruption for 18 months.
Ofgas claims that the cost of the break-up would be closer to Pounds 250m
than the Pounds 3bn cited by British Gas.
Mr James Cooper, chairman of the Gas Consumers' Council which represents
domestic customers, said he was 'astonished' by Sir James's proposals. 'I
wonder whether real competition can exist for the punter. Am I really going
to have the same choice as I have between Sainsbury and Tesco? I suspect
not.'
British Gas has 30 rival companies already supplying industrial customers.
Many of these, including the regional electricity companies, are keen to
enter the domestic market.
But British Gas says its competitors would not have the same safety
standards or an obligation to maintain supplies. According to the company,
its break-up could also mean that customers furthest from the east coast gas
terminals would face higher prices.

DOW CHEMICAL of the US is planning to eliminate about 6 per cent of the jobs
at its corporate headquarters, the company announced yesterday, AP-DJ
reports from Midland, Michigan.
The group posted a Dollars 489m loss for 1992, blaming a glut on the world
chemical market and special charges relating to retiree healthcare benefits
and income tax.
Dow said the costs of the workforce cuts were covered by a Dollars 430m
charge the chemical company took against its fourth-quarter 1992 earnings.
Dow then said the charge would cover asset write-offs and write-downs, plant
shutdowns, divestitures and consolidations.
Between 225 and 275 jobs would be cut at the Michigan office, which employs
about 4,000 people, said Mr Enrique Sosa, president of Dow Chemical's North
American operations.
The company said the cuts resulted from a combination of factors including
slumps in the aerospace, automotive and construction industries, coupled
with increased global competition in a shrinking and depressed worldwide
chemical market.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Restructuring plans halve Beauford shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Beauford, the manufacturer of material handling equipment and
machine tools, halved to 7p yesterday after the announcement of a capital
reorganisation.
The company is proposing to split its 10p ordinary shares into one 1p
ordinary and nine 1p deferred shares. The 7p convertible preference shares
will be converted into four ordinary and six deferred shares and all arrears
of the preference dividend will be eliminated.
The deferred are considered valueless and application to cancel them will be
made as soon as possible.
The plans would leave preference holders with 86.9 per cent of the new
capital as against 44.2 per cent under the existing conversion rights.
Beauford warned that without the restructuring there would be limited scope
for future development.
The company reported losses in 1991 and the first half of 1992. In September
1992, after the sale of its interest in EW Bliss, borrowings were Pounds
13.3m against net assets of Pounds 7.3m. By the end of the year borrowings
had fallen to Pounds 11.7m but the company expected to have to make
substantial write-downs in the value of its assets and make provisions for
restructuring costs in the accounts for the year.
Gearing is considered too high and a debt reduction plan in conjunction with
the company's banks is being pursued.
It has not paid preference dividends since July 1991, leaving arrears at
January 1 of Pounds 1.9m, or ordinary dividends since November 1991.
Taking into account the trading and financial position the board thinks that
there is no prospect of paying the arrears or resuming dividend payments of
the preferential shares in the foreseeable future.
In addition, the ability to redeem the preference shares by July 1 2003
would require an extraordinary and sustained improvement in the trading
performance throughout the period to redemption.

QUALITY SOFTWARE Prod-ucts, a small computer software company based in
Gateshead, plans to seek a stock exchange listing later this month.
It wants to raise between Pounds 5m and Pounds 10m to fund expansion.
Formed in 1981, the company is a leading UK accounting software supplier.
Mr Alan Mordain, chairman, said the listing would enable Quality Software to
develop a new product line - Universal Olas - and engage in joint products
'with a large number of companies which have expressed interest.'
Pre-tax profits for 1992 were expected to be Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 1.5m in
1991), before Pounds 600,000 of exceptional costs, on turnover of Pounds
13.1m (Pounds 11.1m).
The company is expected to be valued at about Pounds 25m.
It currently has some 130 customers, mostly large.

Canadian gold mine
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL OAK Mines, the Vancouver-based gold producer that specialises in
restoring high-cost mines to profitability, has signed an agreement to buy
the mothballed Colomac property in Canada's Northwest Territories.
The seller is Neptune Resources, which will receive 3.5m Royal Oak shares,
worth CDollars 10.2m (Pounds 5.7m), as well as a royalty over five years,
payable if the gold price achieves an annual average of more than Dollars
400 a troy ounce. The deal is expected to be finalised on March 25.
Neptune closed Colomac in mid-1991 after the mine had been in operation for
only a year. At the time, it estimated that a gold price of about Dollars
425 an ounce was required to keep the operation profitable.
Royal Oak said that it hoped to cut cash production costs to less than
Dollars 300 an ounce, partly by running Colomac in tandem with its Giant
mine in Yellowknife.
Unionised workers at the Giant mine have staged a bitter and often violent
strike for the past nine months, but Royal Oak has kept it operating with
outside workers. The company is insisting, among other things, that wages be
linked to the gold price.
Royal Oak plans a feasibility study at Colomac this summer with a view to
reopening the mine in 1994.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Safren 18% lower in poor trading
conditions
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SAFREN, the South African shipping, leisure and freight handling group,
recorded an 18 per cent drop in attributable earnings for the six months to
the end of December as deteriorating trading conditions affected all its
divisions.
Turnover rose marginally to R2.37bn (Dollars 764m) from R2.31bn during the
same period in 1991, but operating profit was 1 per cent lower at R334.6m
compared with R337.8m. A sharp rise, however, in net interest paid - to
R24.2m from R1m - and a decline in the share of associated companies'
profits, which fell to R36.7m from R63.4m, caused attributable earnings to
fall to R109.4m from R133.3m.
The interim dividend is being maintained at 65 cents per share despite
earnings per share falling by 18.6 per cent to 202 cents from 248 cents.
Increased competition and the recession, both in South Africa and abroad,
caused Safmarine, the shipping and transport subsidiary, to experience
declining cargo volumes and reduced freight rates in its liner and bulk
trades.
Increased depreciation and interest arising from large investments in new
ships and containers also affected profit adversely. Safair, the freight
carrier, suffered from the resurgence of hostilities in Angola, while
Flitestar, the domestic airline, incurred substantial losses owing to
overcapacity and predatory pricing on domestic routes.
Profits at Kersaf, the leisure and entertainment arm, were lower due to
difficult trading conditions, aggravated by construction work at its main
resorts and competition from unregulated casinos. Rennies, the freight
handling group, benefited from its participation in a drought relief scheme
in the region and lifted profits.
Safmarine, Rennies and Kersaf respectively contributed 22 per cent, 21 per
cent and 56 per cent to Safren's attributable profit.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: NEC predicts pre-tax loss of
Y40bn as demand slows
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NEC, the Japanese electronics group, revised downwards its results forecast
for the year to March and expects to see a Y40bn (Dollars 344m) pre-tax loss
for the group on a consolidated basis.
The revision comes after NEC announced in October a pre-tax profits forecast
of Y10bn. It reflects an unexpectedly depressed market for electronic
products worldwide in the first three months of this year, the company said.
NEC now forecasts consolidated sales of Y3,620bn, compared with a previous
forecast of Y3,780bn. A pre-tax loss of Y40bn compares with a profit of
Y51.4bn in the year to March 1992. For the parent company, NEC expects a 5
per cent drop in sales to Y2,900bn and a pre-tax profit of Y18bn, which
represents a 77 per cent decline from the previous Y40bn.
The company blamed the unexpectedly severe slowdown in domestic demand,
particularly for electronic devices, for the revision of its results
forecast. When NEC made its profits forecast in October, it had been
expecting a customary seasonal rush of orders in the January to March period
from corporations buying to use up their procurement budget. This year,
however, that buying spree failed to materialise.
NEC has, like many Japanese semiconductor companies, been hurt by a severely
depressed market for memory chips and by weak prices, which lasted until the
fourth quarter of last year. In 1992, NEC lost its position as the world's
largest semiconductor manufacturer to Intel of the US, according to
Dataquest the market research group.
In its computer business, the company faces growing competition from US
manufacturers in its home market where it has a 53 per cent market share.
For the fiscal year beginning in April, however, NEC expects overall
revenues to increase by 4 to 5 per cent as the Japanese government's
economic stimulus package and the recovery in the US market help to lift
trading activity.

AHLSTROM, the Finnish forestry and machinery group, saw pre-tax losses fall
to FM36m (Dollars 6m) last year from FM191m in 1991, writes Christopher
Brown-Humes.
The improvement came as sales grew 22.5 per cent to FM10.15bn from FM8.28bn
and the operating margin rose to FM1.02bn from FM606m.

THE Julius Baer Swiss private banking group is looking for double-digit
profit growth again in 1993, Mr Hans Baer, the chief executive, said
yesterday, writes Ian Rodger in Zurich.
The group's net profit jumped 15 per cent last year to SFr68m (Dollars
44.56m), driven mainly by a 27 per cent rise in commissions from asset and
portfolio management.
*****
FOLKETRYGDFONDET, Norway's national insurance scheme fund, one of the
biggest institutional investors in the domestic securities market, yesterday
reported an increase in unrealised losses on its share portfolio to NKr588m
(Dollars 83.97m) from NKr158m in 1991, writes Karen Fossli in Oslo.
Total assets at the end of last year rose to NKr66.75bn from NKr60.66bn in
the same period a year earlier. The fund was also allowed to invest up to
NKr5bn in state bonds and commercial paper.
*****
Z-LANDERBANK Bank Austria, Austria's largest bank, has denied charges in two
magazines that it laundered money for two east Berlin firms, Novum and
Transcarbon, between 1989 and last year, writes Ian Rodger.
'It is absolutely untrue that we have had anything to do with laundering,'
Mr Rene Alfons Haiden, chief executive, said. The bank said investigations
so far showed that the bank had respected all laws and regulations.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Inoco, the USM-quoted property investor, reduced losses from Pounds 6.82m to
Pounds 4.31m pre-tax over the 12 months to December 31.
The outcome was struck after a profit on the sale of investments of Pounds
111,000 (losses of Pounds 3.1m) now treated as an exceptional rather than
extraordinary item.
Losses of Pounds 2.46m on sale of fixed assets, Pounds 96,000 on sale of
trading stocks and a provision of Pounds 1.6m against carrying value of
trading stocks were also taken above the line.
Losses per share were 2.06p against a restated 3.29p.

FT  02 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Holliday Chemical gets Pounds 150m price
tag
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOLLIDAY Chemical Holdings is to raise about Pounds 70m through the largest
flotation yet this year, valuing the synthetic dyestuffs and speciality
chemicals company at about Pounds 150m.
Mr Michael Peagram, founder, chairman and largest single shareholder, said
the company decided to increase by Pounds 5m to Pounds 35m the amount it
will raise to reduce debt.
This followed some concerns in the City that the company would be saddling
itself with a balance sheet that was unnecessarily highly geared.
Raising this amount of capital would lead to gearing of about 34 per cent,
on a pro-forma basis at the end of 1992, and interest nine times covered by
operating profits.
Holliday is coming to the market through a firm placing of 75 per cent of
the shares; the balance will be available through public offer.
The issue will be priced on March 25; applications will be accepted until
April 1 and dealing will begin on April 14.
The venture capitalists who backed the original buy-out of Holliday from
Holliday Dyes and Chemicals in 1987, will be selling about half of their
overall shareholding.
Holliday's earnings per share have increased from 4.4p in 1988 to 9.7p last
year. Sales last year rose by Pounds 26.2m to Pounds 97m and operating
profit by Pounds 5m to Pounds 14m.
Mr Peagram said he was comfortable with the higher level of gearing - he had
been used to running a company financed largely by venture capital when
interest cover was as low as three times.
The balance of comment from the City had, however, been 'why not raise
Pounds 5m more' to reduce pro-forma gearing from about 46 per cent, the
company said.
Mr Peagram said the group was intent on growing organically but that in the
medium term there would be further cash calls to fund acquisitions.

FT  02 MAR 93 / Ford cuts margin on Mondeo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD has cut its dealers' official profit margin, which is usually 16 per
cent to 17 per cent, to 10 per cent on its Mondeo cars, which are due to go
on sale on March 25.
The move helps Ford to claim that the Mondeo's retail prices, announced
yesterday, will be up to several hundred pounds lower than those of Sierra
models which the Mondeo will replace.
The new car is not quite the bargain Ford is seeking to make it, however,
because the Sierra's retail prices include a margin of 16 per cent to 17 per
cent for the dealer.
In addition, prices of the Sierra, which is imported from Ford's German and
Belgium plants, rose in January by an average of 7.5 per cent.
Ford, which increased prices of UK-built models by an average of 4.5 per
cent at the time, said the Sierra rise was necessary to compensate for
sterling's devaluation. It rejected speculation that such a rise would help
to make the Mondeo - Ford's first 'world car' - appear less expensive.
The company had little choice about cutting dealers' margins on the new car
because all its main rivals have already done so.
Such a move has allowed all these manufacturers to cut 'official' retail
prices.
However, this has little, if any, effect on the amount customers actually
pay for their cars. This is because the severely depressed new car market is
so competitive that dealers had been 'giving away' much of their 16 per cent
to 17 per cent margins anyway. The cut to an official 10 per cent margin
merely gives the dealers less room to manoeuvre.

JOHN Brown, part of the Trafalgar House construction, property, hotels and
shipping group, has won a Dollars 60m (Pounds 42m) contract to build an
acetic acid production plant at Wujing near Shanghai. The contract has been
awarded by China National Technical Import and Export Corporation for
Shanghai Chemical Industries.
Acetic acid is an intermediate chemical in the production of a range of
items, including paints and plastics. The process equipment for the plant
will be bought in Britain, says John Brown, responsible for engineering and
procurement for the plant, which is expected to start production in 1996.

FT  02 MAR 93 / International Company News: Klockner-Werke unveils cutbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KLOCKNER-WERKE, the German steel and engineering group, yesterday revealed
its plan to restructure its steel operations and write off more than 50 per
cent of their outstanding debts.
It is the largest German company to sue for protection from its creditors
under the composition procedure since AEG, the electrical equipment
manufacturer, more than 10 years ago.
It is also the first leading steelmaker to be forced to seek protection in
the latest European steel crisis. The plan, an essential step in the
company's bid to negotiate a debt-relief scheme with leading creditors, was
presented to the local court in Duisburg, where Klockner-Werke is based.
It proposes writing off DM1.4bn (Dollars 848m) of the DM2.7bn owed by the
company's steel subsidiaries, Klockner Stahl and Klockner Edelstahl. The
rest of the group is not affected by the process.
Creditors with their loans secured by property or other assets would receive
60 per cent payment, and other creditors, 40 per cent, the company suggests.
The restructuring involves the closure of one blast furnace at the Bremer
Hutte steel plant in Bremen, reducing raw steel capacity by some 700,000
tonnes, and shedding up to 1,400 jobs.
The company is also negotiating with a group of investors, led by Mr Jurgen
Grossmann, the former chief executive of Klockner Edelstahl, to sell its
plant at Georgsmarienhutte. A decision on that proposal is expected in the
next two weeks, according to a company spokesman, although it depends on the
success of the composition proceedings.
The legal move by Klockner-Werke, one step short of formal bankruptcy
proceedings, was announced in December. The Duisburg judge will seek expert
opinion on the plan from the composition administrator, and from the
Duisburg chamber of commerce and industry. The judge and administrator will
decide whether to summon a creditors' meeting, which must approve the plan
with an 80 per cent vote if it is to succeed.
Deutsche Bank is the com-pany's principal creditor, followed by WestLB, the
state bank in North Rhine-Westphalia. Both are believed to support the move.
The full meeting of creditors is not likely to be called before May.

</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE NINE financial institutions which back Nippon Housing Loan have agreed a
rescue plan for the deeply-troubled lending institution which faces mounting
bad debts from the collapse of the Japanese property market.
The banks which back Nippon Housing Loan, led by Sanwa Bank and Sakura Bank,
have agreed to forego interest of loans for up to 10 years. The group will
also require substantial new loans to pay off mortgage-backed securities
which fall due within the next two years.
Agricultural banks, which were also heavy lenders to Nippon Housing in the
1980s, have agreed to reduce the interest rate on their loans to 2.5 per
cent from 4.5 per cent.
Nippon Housing Loan was set up in the 1970s by a group of commercial banks
to provide housing finance. It is thought to have bad loans of about
Y1,300bn out of a total loan book of about Y2,200bn.
The president of Kawasho, a Japanese steel trader, is resigning after
disclosing a huge loss at a financial subsidiary.
Mr Kinji Ibaraki said he would be tending his resignation at the end of June
to take responsibility for a Y4bn (Dollars 34m) net loss in the year to
March 1993, forced by a Y19.5bn charge for an investment loss at a financial
subsidiary.
Kawasho said Captain, the wholly-owned Osaka financial subsidiary, would be
liquidated after making a net loss of Y12bn and with unrealised losses of
Y7.5bn on failed investments. Kawasho said it would make a loss despite
selling more than Y13bn of securities.

FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Authorities criticised over Uni
raid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NORWEGIAN government-appointed commission has sharply criticised the
country's finance ministry and Banking, Insurance and Securities Commission
for failing to prevent the disastrous raid by Uni Storebrand, Norway's
biggest insurer, on Skandia, its Swedish rival.
The inquiry report examines the events following the bid which culminated in
Uni's collapse in August into the hands of public administrators.
Although the minority Labour government is expected to survive the
repercussions of the commission's findings, the report's criticism casts
doubt over the future of Mr Sigbjoern Johnsen, Norway's finance minister. So
far he has refused to resign over the affair, and over the role of his
special adviser, Mr Arne Oeien.
The commission, led by Mr Erling Sandane, a former supreme court judge,
outlined a series of failings in the finance ministry's handling of Uni's
raid on Skandia.
The report said the ministry and BISC allowed Uni to build a NKr4.7bn
(Dollars 601m) 28.3 per cent stake in Skandia in spite of a law forbidding
Norwegian financial institutions from owning more than 10 per cent of
foreign financial concerns without a special concession.
Uni built the stake before the permit was issued. The commission said the
subsequent permit should never have been issued, but it cleared the ministry
of allegations that Uni had been given an unofficial go-ahead to pursue
Skandia.
'The commission of inquiry points out that Uni Storebrand had a considerable
liquidity problem, and the finance ministry ought not to have issued a
permit when the question of a capital expansion was unclear.'
The report said Uni provided inadequate details of its plans and financial
position while the authorities failed to make strong enough demands for the
information.
Uni borrowed heavily to finance the Skandia acquisition in an abortive
attempt to force the Swedish insurer into a Nordic insurance pact. Skandia
rejected Uni's advances. This precipitated a sharp fall Uni's shares leading
to a liquidity squeeze which forced the company's collapse.
In response to the report the finance ministry said it would follow a
recommendation to set up a public commission to undertake a further probe
into Uni's collapse and the role of its board and top executives.

FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Rising exports give lift to
South Korean electronics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HIGHER sales of semi-conductors and increased exports of consumer
electronics led to South Korea's four main electronics companies all
reporting growth in turnover and profits for 1992.
The continued growth of the Korean economy, although weakening, is another
reason for their improved profitability in contrast to their Japanese
rivals, which are suffering from the effects of a domestic recession.
Combined profits among the four electronics manufacturers jumped by 70.2 per
cent to Won125.5bn (Dollars 157.8m), while sales rose by 11.9 per cent to
Won12,600bn. However, 1993 results could be much lower if the US decides in
favour of imposing dumping duties on Korean chips, which would severely
curtail exports to its largest overseas market.
Samsung Electronics, Korea's largest electronics company, reported a 5.5 per
cent increase in net profits to Won72.4bn, while sales rose by 16.6 per cent
to Won6,100bn.
Sales of its semiconductor division, which is the world's fifth-largest
producer of memory chips, grew by 25 per cent to Won1,340bn, and provided
most of the group's profits. The consumer electronics division's sales were
up 10 per cent at Won3,300bn. Sales for the computer and telecommunications
division rose by 29 per cent to Won1,430bn.
Earnings at Goldstar jumped by 43.2 per cent to Won26.5bn, although sales
only grew by 2.9 per cent to Won3,780bn.
The improvement was mainly due to exports, which grew by 7.6 per cent to
Won2,000bn. Sales were brisk in south-east Asia and Latin America, where
Goldstar has increased marketing efforts to counter weakening exports to
North America.
Domestic sales slipped by 2 per cent to Won1,780bn, which Goldstar blamed on
depressed consumer spending caused by slower economic growth.
Daewoo Electronics posted a 22 per cent increase in profits to Won16.6bn,
while sales rose by 9.6 per cent to Won1,700bn.
Daewoo said it performed particularly well in the domestic market in spite
of the general slowdown in consumer spending because of the introduction of
new products, especially washing machines and televisions. Domestic sales
rose by 16.6 per cent to Won664.4bn.
Hyundai Electronics, which suffered a loss of Won27bn in 1991, reported a
profit of Won10bn as sales grew by 25 per cent to Won1,030bn. The recovery
was largely caused by increased sales of semiconductors, with exports up 60
per cent to Won500bn.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Observer: Tory home rule
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the rules of thumb for up-and-coming Tory politicians is that
reputations are more easily damaged than enhanced by a Home Office posting.
Hence, some surprise at the extensive supporting cast for the Home Office's
local government conference.
Health secretary Virginia Bottomley banged on about the need for a firm
stand on persistent juvenile delinquents as did John 'hellfire' Patten, the
education secretary. Even Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party chairman, was
keen to get his message across, opining that law and order would be one of
the two great national issues in the local elections in May.
But despite all this tough talk about cracking down on offenders, the
underlying impression was left that for many Tories the real villain of the
piece is Tony Blair, the shadow home secretary, whose high-profile stance on
crime over the past week or so has been threatening to rob the Tories of one
of their most prized political assets - a popular belief that Labour is
'soft' on the issue.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Writs likely at Lloyd's this week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 2,000 members of syndicates at the Lloyd's insurance market
formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency expect to serve writs against
their agents early this week, Richard Lapper writes.
But there are strong indications that the prospects are receding for an
out-of-court settlement between about a dozen groups of loss-making Names -
the individuals whose capital backs the Lloyd's market - and their agents.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Lloyd's, said: 'The problem has some
fairly intractable dimensions.'
Seven Gooda Walker syndicates lost more than Pounds 900m between 1987 and
1990, mainly because of their involvement in so-called 'spiral' reinsurance
business in which syndicates and companies reinsure each others' exposures
to high-level catastrophe loss.
Some 2,000 Gooda Walker Names, some of whom face losses more than five times
the amount they deposited with Lloyd's, voted last November to take legal
action against 67 agents who placed them with the Gooda syndicates.
Mr Michael Deeny, an accountant and rock concert promoter who chairs the
Gooda Walker Names Action Group, said his group had raised more than Pounds
4m to finance the action.

But there are strong indications that the prospects are receding for an

'The problem has some fairly intractable dimensions,' said Mr Peter

4m to finance the action.
Hopes of an out-of-court settlement were raised last October when Mr
Middleton appointed a panel of Names and market professionals to examine the
possibility of a deal.
This would involve errors and omissions (E&amp;O) insurers, who covered the
agents against possible negligence claims. But the E&amp;O insurers are
themselves Lloyd's syndicates, which must satisfy both their own Names that
a settlement is also in their interests, Mr Middleton pointed out.

COAL reserves of 80bn tonnes have been found in Pakistan's Sind province,
Reuter reports from Islamabad.
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was informed about the find in the southern
province's Thar area while flying to the central Sind district of Nawabshah,
the official APP news agency said.
No further details were immediately available about Pakistan's biggest
reported coal discovery.
Mr Sharif issued instructions to concerned authorities to develop fully the
mine for coal-based generation of electricity to help meet Pakistan's energy
shortage, APP said.
Pakistani authorities said last that year they had found what they called
the largest coal field in south-east Asia and the Middle East. The field's
reserves have been put at more than 10bn tonnes.
Those reserves are also located in Sind at Thara-Jo-Goth near the Indian
border.
Previously Pakistan had estimated its coal reserves at only 579.6m tonnes
with an annual production of more than 2m tonnes in recent years.

Yugoslav peace talks are scheduled to resume at the United Nations today
provided all the main participants show up, Reuter reports from the UN.
They are to focus on a plan and map drafted by the co-chairmen of the
international conference on the former Yugoslavia, Mr Cyrus Vance,
representing the UN, and Lord Owen, on behalf of the European Community.
The plan would divide embattled Bosnia-Herzegovina into 10 provinces - three
with Moslems majorities, three Serb, two Croat and two mixed.
Bosnian Serb chief Radovan Karadzic was due to arrive in New York yesterday
apparently satisfied he would not be impeded by a private lawsuit brought
against him during his previous stay by organisations acting on behalf of
two victims of alleged atrocities by Serb forces in Bosnia.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Bosnian Croats close Moslem supply routes

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIGHTING was reported on several fronts in Bosnia yesterday as Moslems cut
off by Serb rebels in the east waited for the US to begin an air-drop of
emergency relief.
Moslem-controlled Sarajevo radio said shellfire killed one person and
wounded another in the besieged Bosnian capital. Shells also landed in the
city's outskirts and sniper fire was intense at times, it said.
A fresh row flared between Moslem-led Bosnian government troops and Bosnian
Croats, nominal allies in the civil war, when Bosnian Croat forces announced
that they were closing all supply routes between Croatia and Moslem-held
territory.
The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) accused the Bosnian government forces of
deploying 25,000 troops in central Bosnia and abandoning the fighting
against Serb forces. 'The HVO has therefore decided to close all roads
between Croatia and Bosnia for supplies of the Bosnian army,' it said in a
statement from Mostar, Croat military headquarters in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
In spite of promises to allow aid convoys to Moslems, Bosnian Serb forces
often block or delay overland convoys. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb
leader, banned a convoy of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees from going
to Cerska, eastern Bosnia, which has been without any outside relief in the
last 11 months. 'He said the convoy would be allowed to go to Zepa, which
means people would have to travel for miles and miles over the mountains,
through snow and across front lines to pick up the aid.' said Mr Laurens
Jolles of the UNHCR Belgrade office. Western journalists were also refused
permission to travel Serb-held parts of Bosnia.
Serb forces at the weekend continued to expel Moslems from the Banja Luka
region, western Bosnia. Some 2,500 Moslems, clutching all the belongings
they could carry, were forced to walk to Turbe, a Bosnian-held village. UN
peacekeepers and western journalists helped carry children unable to walk
over the snowy hillsides.
At one point, Serb fighters reportedly fired on the queue of refugees.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Leaders versus parties: Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Michel Rocard has long been the white hope of a certain free-wheeling
school of liberal social democracy in France. So when he launched his
proposal for the creation of a broad new centre-left political movement,
encompassing socialists, ecologists, reformed communists and moderate
liberals, the immediate reaction from rivals and opponents (two categories
that include just about all the stars in the French political firmament) was
astonishment followed almost immediately by cynical dismissal.
This was just a wily manoeuvre, they said, designed to change the rules of
the game in his favour. By calling for the creation of a broad-bottomed
movement, he was seeking to enlarge his own constituency as well as making a
takeover bid for the ecological vote, which has swelled as fast as the
Socialist vote has shrunk.
By criticising the accumulated mistakes of the Socialist party, he was
effectively criticising President Francois Mitterrand, distancing himself
from his discredited rivals in the party leadership, and trying to position
himself for the presidential election campaign of 1995.
The Rocard proposal is more than clever footwork, however; it may yet start
a serious debate on political reform in France, and perhaps in Europe as
well.
One reason for the Socialists' decline, according to Mr Rocard, is that they
have told too many political lies. In 1981 they promised miraculous economic
improvements which were unrealistic; then in 1983 they did a massive U-turn
to economic austerity, but tried to hide the fact. A second reason was that
many have engaged in wholesale corruption.
But the heart of Mr Rocard's analysis is much more structural than these two
factors: traditional socialism no longer corresponds to the modern world.
'The very name of socialism was forged in a conception of the world wholly
based on production and class relationships . . . We have entered a market
society where inequalities appear in many forms, but where the feeling of
belonging to a class, to a collective movement, is no longer perceived as a
reality.'
This explains the rise of the ecological movement, he believes. 'When the
French can no longer find the springs of their identity in a social class,
nor in a religion, nor in a profession, nor in a generation, nor in a level
of income, what is left to identify with? What surrounds them immediately:
their environment.'
The dilemma for a convinced socialist such as Mr Rocard is that he needs,
but does not yet have, a new message for the times. Conservatives may delude
themselves that this is just a socialist problem, which leaves them free to
triumph. In reality, the conservative agenda has been essentially defined
for most of this century by and in opposition to socialism. The best
ideological hope for conservatives, is that socialists should fail to
modernise their message.
The question is, how can the socialists set about modernising their message?
In most west European countries politics has been, for several generations,
a war of classes, dressed up as a war of doctrines, and organised through a
war of parties. As ideological organisations, it is in the nature of parties
to resist changes in their doctrines; just look at the British Labour party
and its absurd clinging to Clause IV and the idea of nationalisation.
Rocard's implicit answer is threefold: you must break the old party
stranglehold of dogma, ritual and faction; you need someone who is above the
party, and free from the dogmas, to lead the process of rethinking; and
therefore you need to dilute the party into a larger, looser group, under a
paramount chief.
Now the French political system may be peculiarly amenable to this strategy
of political reform. First, the political spectrum contains enough different
parties to permit a flexible choice of groupings.
Second, the lure of the presidency generates a number of potential leaders
who are not wholly dependent on their parties; at the moment, there are at
least six credible potential candidates for the presidency, three on the
left and three on the right; and Rocard is one.
Italy and Britain, which are in even greater need of reform than France,
have systems that will make reform more difficult, if not impossible.
Italians used to claim their PR system gave them 'representative'
government. However, the parties represented only themselves and their
clients. Political decadence has gone so far that the parties are paralysed,
except in their resistance to change; their leaderships are largely
decapitated. Virtually the last desperate hope for reform is that it will
finally come from grassroots referendums.
The British myth is that the voting system provides 'strong', therefore
good, government. In fact the British system is locked solid by the
anachronistic war of the parties; as a result, not merely are there no
alternative political leaders who are independent of party, but the leaders
in place are the prisoners of their parties. Where the governing party is
deeply and irreconcilably split on the most important issue of the day, as
it is now, there is no escape from government which is both weak and bad.
In France, some constitutional reforms are already under discussion; the
paradox is that these might be good for the quality of ongoing government,
but bad for structural political reform. If members of parliament were
forbidden to hold a second elective office, parliament might be more
effective; but politicians who did not have an alternative power base in a
town hall or region would be less independent and more subject to party
discipline.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Monday Interview: Poland's reigning queen - Hanna Suchocka,
prime minister of Poland, talks to Anthony Robinson and Christopher Bobinski
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanna Suchocka, Poland's first woman prime minister, who begins a three-day
official visit to Britain tomorrow, is not the first politician to detect
the hidden hand of providence behind an unexpected rise to power. But she is
hard-pressed to find another explanation behind the telephone call she
received last July which led to her appointment to the second most powerful
political office in Poland.
Poland was in crisis: the then prime minister designate, Waldemar Pawlak,
was unable to form a cabinet and the country's political matchmakers were
worried by growing public discontent. Poland's foreign partners were
concerned about the outlook for political stability, economic reform and
foreign investment.
Bronislaw Geremek, leader of the Democratic Union party, Solidarity veteran
and close adviser to President Lech Walesa, and one of the most influential
strategists in Polish politics, recognised that Poland needed a new leader,
untainted by the endless compromises and intrigue of Polish politics. He
remembered Hanna Suchocka, the competent, no-nonsense woman with a brisk but
friendly manner with whom he had worked on drawing up the post-communist
constitution.
Geremek's telephone call to President Walesa, proposing Suchocka for the
prime minister's job, produced a positive response. Another call followed to
Suchocka in London, where she was attending a legal conference - and Poland
had its first female leader since the Angevin Queen Jadwiga in the 14th
century.
Speaking in her newly furnished office in Warsaw's Council of Ministers
building, with reproduction Austrian Biedermeir furniture and vases of
freesias and chrysanthemums, Suchocka recalled that her first reaction to
Geremek's offer was 'sheer panic'. When she asked whether there were other
candidates, she was told that all alternatives had been excluded. 'I never
had any ambition to become prime minister; at most I thought of a career in
an international organisation,' she says.
'Maybe it was providence. I certainly don't see myself as a saviour or
anything like that. But it happened and somehow a sort of consensus has
grown up around me.'
After seven tough months as the prime minister of 'a very difficult country
by tradition and national character', she enjoys a 76 per cent approval
rating in opinion polls. Such support helps provide the moral authority
needed to preside effectively over a disparate seven-party ruling coalition
which does not enjoy a guaranteed majority in the 460-seat Sejm, the lower
house of parliament.
Public support also helped to stiffen her resolve through a wave of strikes
in the car plants and coalmines just after taking power last summer and a
second wave in the Silesian coal mines early this year. She has also
survived months of gruelling parliamentary debate as opposition and
government MPs alike tried to tack extra spending provisions on to a 1993
budget which the government had to keep within tight limits to gain a
Dollars 660m stand-by loan from the International Monetary Fund, due to be
approved soon.
Last month the government finally managed to garner enough votes from
outside the coalition to gain parliamentary approval for the budget as
originally proposed.
What clinched the outcome was a threat by Suchocka to resign if the vote
went against her and a warning from President Walesa that he would dissolve
parliament and hold new elections if the vote led to the government's
defeat. The prime minister and president gambled successfully on their hunch
that MPs would not have the stomach for fresh elections, which could have
led to the downfall of an increasingly popular prime minister.
The upshot is that Suchocka comes to London, where she will address a
Polish-UK business conference organised by the Confederation of British
Industry as well as meeting John Major, prime minister, with the budget
crisis safely behind her. This has opened the way to a new IMF agreement
which in turn is linked to future loans from the World Bank and is expected
to make Poland more attractive to foreign investors.
Suchocka, who is 46, has not only emerged as one of central Europe's most
successful politicians, she is also presiding over growing signs of an
economic recovery after three years of recession. Last year the economy
stabilised; this year it is expected to grow by between 2 and 3 per cent.
She has established a close working relationship with both former academics
such as Jerzy Osiatynski, finance minister, and Jacek Kuron, labour
minister, once feared by the communist regime for his close rapport with
Poland's militant workers. Suchocka and Kuron, in particular, make an
unlikely team. The fast-talking Kuron, with his jeans and
cigarette-and-whisky-tainted voice, relishes his rapport with the rather
prim prime minister in twinsets and pearls. They co-operate closely in
trying to sell the government's 'enterprise pact', which offers wage
restraint by workers in exchange for more union say in management and the
privatisation process.
Fellow politicians say one of Suchocka's strongest points is her ability to
address the public in simple, everyday language. 'I never use the language
of hatred. But that does not mean that I don't sometimes feel the urge to
lay into somebody,' she says, giving a hint of the underlying tensions in
the government.
Andrzej Olechowski, a former finance minister and now an economic adviser to
the president, says the prime minister's main qualities are those of a good
chairman. She is not a forceful, self-opinionated leader like Lady Thatcher,
but a good listener able to reach a consensus and enforce it.
In this she resembles her close friend, Hanna Gronkiewicz-Waltz, chosen as
chairman of the Polish central bank by President Walesa 18 months ago. The
fact that women head both the government and the most important financial
institution in post-communist Poland is without precedent.
Thus far both appointments have turned out well. Thanks to her management
skills, Suchocka has managed to keep together a coalition of unlikely
political bedfellows: free-market liberals to dyed-in-the-wool Polish
nationalists and Catholic fundamentalists. Where she has strong views,
Suchocka manages to express them without causing offence.
As a practising Catholic, for example, she holds forceful anti-abortion
opinions but managed to distance the government from this divisive issue by
insisting that parliament voted freely. As a result, Poland now has a highly
restrictive abortion law, but one which stops short of the virtually total
ban demanded by the powerful Catholic church.
Her ability to steer the government past potential hazards is helped by the
unwillingness of the coalition partners to push their differences to
breaking point. Suchocka herself may be popular, but the political parties
and the government itself are not.
Ultimately, the secret of her success seems to lie in the way her
personality and background as the daughter of a small town pharmacist from
Pleszew, western Poland, appear to make her the personification of the
desire of millions of Poles to live in a reasonably prosperous, stable and
above all 'normal' society.
After 60 traumatic years of war, invasion and communist domination, Poles
now have the opportunity to forge good relations with their powerful
neighbours, Germany and Russia, and return to the mainstream of European
culture and trade to which they have always felt they belonged.
Strengthening ties with Britain, with its large Anglo-Polish community and
wartime alliance, is part of this process.
It is also part of rebuilding Poland as what Suchocka herself defines as 'a
normal country'. This may sound an excessively modest goal in the west, but
not to Poles and the citizens of other countries in east and central Europe
now spreading their wings after decades of captivity.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Clinton eclipses Republican sun: America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After Franklin Roosevelt defeated Herbert Hoover in 1932, the Democrats
controlled the White House for 20 years, created a taste for government
activism and permanently altered the social and economic landscape. It is
far too soon to argue that President Bill Clinton will have a remotely
comparable impact on US politics. But his remarkable personal attributes,
coupled with seismic changes in the economic, social and diplomatic
environment, suggest American conservatives may face some very lean years.
At times Republicans are confronted by a politician so perfect that he might
be an android built in some mad scientist's lab. Mr Clinton has a formidable
IQ and a near-photographic memory. Yet he radiates warmth as well as
rationality; he understands popular culture (would any republican leader
feel comfortable on stage with Michael Jackson?); and he is a superb
communicator. Mr Clinton has a gift for mastering complex subjects and
presenting them in simple terms children can grasp. He is equally
comfortable delivering a televised address to the nation, debating in a
'townhall' meeting, jousting with journalists or merely chatting with folks
at a MacDonald's restaurant.
Who can the Republicans throw into battle against so accomplished a
political quarterback? Messrs Robert Dole and Robert Michel, the Republican
leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives, are solid, honourable
politicians, but they can match neither Mr Clinton's intellect nor his
rhetoric. Potential Republican presidential candidates in 1996 are mostly
lying low. Among governors, Mr Pete Wilson of California, once highly rated,
may have been irretrievably damaged by his state's deep recession and budget
crisis. Mr Dick Cheney and Mr Jack Kemp, defence and housing secretaries
respectively in President Bush's cabinet, remain well respected. But one
wonders how either would measure up against Mr Clinton, whose authority will
be steadily enhanced by the pomp and ceremony of office.
Much else is going Mr Clinton's way. The timing of the business cycle is
just perfect for the Democrats. George Bush was torpedoed by three years of
economic stagnation; Mr Clinton inherits an economy that we now know was
growing at an annual rate of almost 5 per cent in the fourth quarter of last
year.
Yet the good news is sinking in so slowly that popular opinion will probably
associate the recovery with Mr Clinton's economic package. Given the nature
of business cycles, the US economy is likely to grow at an annual rate of 3
per cent (perhaps more) for the next few years, almost regardless of the
White House's policies. Yet in 1996 Mr Clinton will sound extremely
plausible when he claims credit for restoring jobs and prosperity.
The end of the cold war, while welcomed by Republicans, represents another
heavy blow to their electoral fortunes. The potential threat from a heavily
armed communist foe - an 'evil empire' in Ronald Reagan's words - gave
American conservatives a sense of unity and purpose. Now that the US is the
only military superpower, defence is largely neutralised as a political
issue. There has been little public reaction to the very deep real defence
cuts proposed by Mr Clinton.
Republicans seem equally vulnerable on social issues. Mr Clinton will
undoubtedly propose a comprehensive plan for reforming the flawed healthcare
system. People will dislike some aspects of the plan, especially the need
for new taxes to finance cover for the uninsured, but they will respect him
for tackling an issue that Republican presidents dodged for too long. Mr
Clinton is also more in tune with changing social mores than his
conservative opponents: by being pro abortion and pro gay rights he is
moving with the tide of public opinion (especially among the young). The
Republican party's ability to adapt flexibly to social change is badly
hampered by the growing influence at local level of the fundamentalist
Christian right.
As if this were not enough, conservatives have to realise that their
political ascendancy during the past 12 years was never quite what it
seemed. In the 1980s, Republicans briefly controlled the Senate; but
Democrats have enjoyed large majorities in the House of Representatives for
four decades. If the nation had really been converted to conservative
doctrines in the Reagan years, the Republicans would have won far more
Congressional seats.
There is always a chance that Mr Clinton will stumble badly. He could be
undermined by a foreign-policy disaster or (less likely) by some unexpected
economic setback. But if conservatives want to regain power in 1996, they
will have to articulate an agenda for government that competes with Mr
Clinton's. This will not be easy, if only because he has appropriated much
of their best language - from 'empowering' individuals to 'reinventing'
government.
Mr Clinton is also canny in deliberately framing his policies to appeal to
middle-income families, which are far more numerous than the minority groups
that monopolised the attention of Democrats during much of the 1970s and
1980s or the rich, who still enjoy disproportionate clout in the Republican
party. It all adds up to a challenge of historic proportions for the
conservative thinktanks which, at least geographically, still surround the
White House.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Foreign Exchange and Money Markets: Eyes on Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MAIN focus in foreign exchange markets this week is on whether the
Bundesbank will ease monetary policy again at its council meeting on
Thursday, writes James Blitz.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, hinted at the weekend that
the easing in minimum reserve requirements for German banks, due to take
effect today, could lead to a decline in lending rates in the German cash
market.
However, there has been considerable speculation that the lombard and
discount rates might also be changed on Thursday, not least because of the
fledgling tensions in the European Community's exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International in London, believes
there are several reasons why a cut could come now.
He points out that monetary growth is slowing, the recession in the
manufacturing sector is deepening and business confidence fell further in
January.
Recent inflation data from the German states may have dented any willingness
to cut rates. But, Mr Lyons says: 'Although the February inflation data was
stubbornly high, the other recent domestic indicators point to the need for
lower rates.'
Miss Alison Cottrell, an international economist at Midland Global Markets
in London, thinks that the Bundesbank will not ease its official rates at
all.
It will not want to be seen to make any policy change immediately after this
weekend's G7 meeting, giving the impression that it can be swayed by
international pressures.
Today's change in minimum reserve requirements also ties the Bundesbank's
hand, because there will be more liquidity in German money markets, and the
central bank would not want to confuse markets by easing policy.
If there is tension in the ERM, Miss Cottrell believes the Bundesbank could
buy time by cutting the repo rate, which it has not done since rates were
cut earlier this month.

FT  01 MAR 93 / International Bonds: Sterling borrowers ready to lock into
low rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Eurosterling sector of the international bond market is poised for a
marked rise in new issuance in the coming weeks, as an increasing number of
borrowers take the view that the time is right to lock into the lowest
interest rates the UK has enjoyed for 20 years.
UK corporate treasurers, who have so far declined to borrow extensively in
the sterling Eurobond market for fear of missing out on further base rate
cuts, are now looking hard at the various opportunities for raising
fixed-rate sterling funds.
A strong UK government bond market, which had fully discounted a further cut
in base rates before this weekend's comments from the chancellor of the
exchequer that no cut was in prospect, has also increased the attraction of
tapping the Eurosterling sector.
There is talk in the Eurobond market that the World Bank is considering
proposals from banks with regard to reopening by as much as Pounds 100m to
Pounds 150m its Pounds 200m 7 1/4 per cent Eurobond issue due 1998, launched
last November.
British Gas is also said to be looking to raise Pounds 200m through a
fixed-rate Eurobond issue with a maturity of seven to 10 years.
Neither borrower had any official comment on the rumours. However, British
Gas, which announced its 1992 results last week, is known to want to take
Pounds 500m out of the market this year, and is also known to favour the
longer end of the yield curve.
British Gas is a frequent and highly-regarded borrower in the Eurobond
market, and syndicate managers say that any sterling Eurobonds it issues
will be snapped up by domestic and international investors who are currently
starved of paper with seven-to-10-year maturities in the sector. This lack
of supply has caused the yield spread on recently-issued paper with those
maturities to tighten.
For example, the spread on the seven-year Pounds 150m issue by Argyll, the
UK supermarket group, has fallen to about 72 points over the 9 per cent UK
gilt due in 2000, from a spread at launch of 80 basis points on February 17.
The spread on the Royal Bank of Scotland's Pounds 150m 20-year issue of
subordinated Eurobonds has dropped to 125 basis points above the comparable
UK gilt from 140 basis points at launch on January 28.
The exception has been last week's Pounds 100m issue from Peugeot Talbot
Motor Company, the UK subsidiary of the French car group. The yield spread
on its bonds, due December 1997, has risen to more than 100 basis points
above the 8 3/4 per cent UK gilt due 1997 from a spread at launch of 90
basis points.
Syndicate managers involved in the deal offer two overriding reasons for the
widening: the fact that Peugeot's long-term debt is not rated, and the
issuer's absence from the Eurosterling market since 1981. Furthermore, the
maturity of just under five years is not so attractive to institutional
investors.
However, they note that competition for the Peugeot mandate was fierce, with
no fewer than seven banks in the running. They also believe that the spread
on the bonds would have widened further if the supply of corporate paper had
not been so low.
In recent weeks, a high proportion of the UK borrowers in the sterling
Eurobond market have been financial institutions seeking to raise long-term
funding either to top up their regulatory capital or, in the case of
insurance companies, to raise extra capital for their operations.
The issues have tended to coincide with the publication of the borrowers'
1992 results, and syndicate managers expect more UK borrowers to announce
fund-raising exercises with their annual results over the next few weeks.
Last week, Royal Insurance raised Pounds 100m of subordinated Eurobonds due
2003. 'We wanted to lock into beneficial interest rates,' says Mr Roy
Randall, head of group corporate relations at Royal Insurance.
The bonds have replaced the group's existing short-dated bank borrowings and
have served to push out its debt profile. Together with Royal's Pounds 76m
issue of convertible Eurobonds, launched last December, one-third of the
group's borrowings has now got a 10-year maturity profile. More importantly,
Mr Randall says that the recent bond issues have resulted in a considerable
saving in the group's borrowing costs.
Also last week, Woolwich Building Society raised a similar amount of
subordinated sterling Eurobonds, but with a much longer maturity of 24 3/4
years.
The Province of Ontario will launch its first global Canadian dollar bond
issue in the near future. The issue, of at least CDollars 1bn with a
maturity of 10 years, will be lead-managed by Merrill Lynch Canada, Nomura
Canada, ScotiaMcLeod and Wood Gundy.
Ontario said the indicated yield spread of the bonds was around 90 basis
points above comparable Canadian government bonds. It said the issue would
be at a fixed rate, and there were no plans to swap the proceeds into
floating rate.
The issue will be part of the province's borrowing programme for 1993-94,
estimated at about CDollars 8.9bn.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: The value of hedging comes in for
re-assessment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME fund managers are giving hedging a bad name. To most people, the term
implies risk reduction: logic suggests that a 'hedge fund' should carry less
market exposure than a normal investment fund, for instance.
In practice, that may not be true. The growing number of such funds being
sold internationally carry a wide array of risk profiles. How potential
investors assess for themselves the balance between risk and potential
return from such vehicles is an open question.
From their inception in the US, hedge funds have always looked remarkably
unhedged. Among the leaders in the field is Mr George Soros, the Hungarian
fund manager who achieved near-legendary status when a massive bet he placed
against the European exchange rate mechanism came good last year.
But Mr Soros himself lost Dollars 800m when he wrongly predicted a stock
market crash spreading from Japan in the mid-1980s: 'hedge' hardly seems the
right word to describe such an investment approach
Some hedge funds - many of which grew up in the commodities markets - run
rudimentary hedging strategies that hardly warrant the name.
Such imperfect hedges can come disastrously unstuck. Many US currency funds
 -a popular investment vehicle in 1991 and the first part of 1992, as US
interest rates fell - discovered this last autumn.
A popular approach had been to go long of higher-yielding European
currencies (the Italian lira or sterling ) and shorting the D-Mark to create
a currency 'hedge'. Such a strategy was based on the apparent belief that
the parities between currencies in the ERM were fixed, effectively making
the lira or sterling a proxy for the D-Mark.
The hedge funds now becoming familiar outside the US largely take a more
cautious approach, or so they claim. They still claim to be able to make
returns far in excess of normal market levels, given the apparent level of
risk, though.
The demand for such vehicles has come with falling worldwide interest rates.
Not surprisingly, hedge funds - or other geared 'futures funds'  - like
investors to judge their promised returns against money-market levels.
Cresvale, a UK-based securities house that has raised Dollars 140m for three
hedge funds over the past year, says it aims to make around three times the
return available from cash, with no extra risk.
Citibank has just attracted Dollars 257m for a three-year geared fund,
Spectrum 95, which aims for returns between two and three times more than
three-year dollar rates (which currently stand at little more than 4 per
cent). Both have targeted the averagely well-off who are now the target for
such leveraged investments (Citicorp's minimum investment was Dollars
100,000, Cresvale's Dollars 10,000.)
Is it possible to make higher returns without also taking on higher risks?
Only if the market has mispriced particular financial instruments
(Cresvale's claim), or through a portfolio diversification approach which
reduces overall exposure (Citibank's).
For investors, the problem is how to assess the claims fund managers make
for their own ability to identify and take advantage of these opportunities
 -as well as the quality of their risk-management analysis at hedging away
risks.
Cresvale, for instance, claims to hedge investments in Japanese equities
with equity warrants in a way that leaves it with no underlying exposure to
the Japanese equity market. 'The mispricing is in the relative valuation of
the warrants,' says Mr Lester Petch, managing director of Cresvale
International Asset Management.
Analysed on the standard Black-Scholes method of option pricing, the
warrants (or long-dated options) look cheap, he says, 'but you have to know
how to extra the value'.
In theory, such option strategies should struggle to show a return when
market volatility is low - as in the Japanese market over recent months.
However, Cresvale claims a return of 18 per cent in the year since its funds
started. As leveraged investment funds like this become more familiar, it
may well be time to reassess what hedging really means.

FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Gilts: Adjustment in perception of inflation trends
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SLOW but steady rally in gilts is starting to attract attention. It
indicates the degree to which perceptions about long-term inflation trends
in the UK have changed over the past month.
Since late January, yields for 10-year gilts have come down by about 50
basis points from 8.2 per cent to around 7.7 per cent, their lowest level
for 21 years. The reduction in yields for 20-year bonds has been even more
marked, with a fall of 90 basis points, while the fall at the five-year mark
has been about 70 basis points.
According to Mr George Magnus, international economist at S . G. Warburg
Securities, the downward movement in yields underlines how gilt
practitioners are taking a sanguine view on price pressures in the UK
economy over. That fits in with the fragile state of much of the world
economy, with demand pressures and consequently inflationary pressures
extremely muted.
These trends have depressed yields for government bonds in most markets in
the past month. While the investment return on gilts rose by a healthy 2 per
cent during February, the performance of Japanese, German and French bonds
was slightly better, at between 2.2 per cent and 2.3 per cent. The return
for US bonds was somewhat lower at 1.9 per cent, according to calculations
by Warburg Securities.
Economic data published in the UK during the past week have done little to
alter the view that any economic recovery will be slow and protracted.
Economists have tended to ignore indications that the M0 measure of the
money supply is rising at above the Treasury's target rate, a development
which would normally be taken as a sign of inflationary pressures.
According to preliminary estimates based on Bank of England figures, M0 rose
in February by a year-on-year rate of between 4.2 per cent and 4.6 per cent.
Confirmation of these figures, due later today, would make last month the
second month running in which the measure has risen at above the 4 per cent
year-on-year target.
However, many in the gilt market accept the explanation that recent cuts in
interest rates have reduced the incentive for consumers and businesses to
hold money in bank accounts. As a result, more funds have found their way
into notes and coins - the main constituents of the M0 measure.
Over the longer term, worries remain that the Pounds 50bn or so of
government borrowing expected in 1993-94 will lead to such a large volume of
gilt issues from the Bank of England that yields along the yield curve will
be pushed up to an unacceptably high level.
According to Mr Roger Bootle, chief economist at Midland Bank, the
government is making a strategic mistake by issuing most new gilts in the
form of long-dated bonds which threaten to cause 'unnecessarily high long
yields'. His view is that - in order to reduce the threat of what he calls a
'financial crisis' - the Bank of England should switch more issues into a
mixture of short-dated gilts, National Savings bonds, index-linked gilts and
foreign currency debt.
He reckons this would ensure long-dated yields did not go too high, helping
to bring down the long-term costs of borrowing and aiding economic recovery
in Britain over the next few years.
According to calculations by Mr Neil Williams at the London office of
Japanese investment house Daiwa, the government is likely to overfund the
public sector borrowing requirement in 1992-93 by about Pounds 4.5bn,
meaning that cash of roughly this amount will go towards funding the 1993-94
PSBR. That news should be generally positive for the gilt market. It should
depress the volume of issues in the coming financial year.
More goods news for the gilt market would come from any government
announcement that the full-funding rule is to be abandoned, meaning that
purchases by banks and building societies of gilts would count towards
financing the PSBR.
While many gilts specialists have been pressing for some time for a change
in the rules, there are confident expectations that Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor of the exchequer, may indeed announce an end to full funding in
the March 16 Budget, on the grounds that the switch would boost the money
supply and so help an economic upturn.

FT  01 MAR 93 / US Money and Credit: Corporate issuers take advantage of
all-time lows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER the US stockmarket's qualms about the Clinton economic plan, the
bond market is having no such doubts. Bond yields fell to all-time lows last
week, and corporate issuers took full advantage, offering record amounts of
new paper.
The slide in yields occured at the start of the week, with the price of the
benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rising by  7/8 to 102 7/16 on Monday, and
then gaining almost a point and a half on Tuesday. This, in turn, caused the
long bond yield to fall below the 7 per cent mark, to 6.93 on Monday, and
then drop to 6.82 per cent a day later.
This change in sentiment has been swift. Something over a month ago - on
January 12 - the long bond yield was standing at 7.47 per cent. Last week's
developments can also claim a place in the history books. Since the US
Treasury began regular auctions of the 30-year bonds in 1977, the closing
yield had never dropped below 7 per cent until this month, and the 6.82 per
cent level marked a record low.
The market, admittedly, did not hold on to all of these gains for the rest
of the week. Midweek, there was a fairly sharp fall in prices, and trading
then remained volatile on Thursday, although the closing yield on the day
was unchanged at 6.88 per cent.
On Friday, dealers paid more attention to the blast under New York's World
Trade Center complex - which disrupted trading by several large firms - and
the long bond yield ended its momentous week at 6.9 per cent.
The question is whether the market can hang on to these levels over the next
five sessions, when some key economic statistics will be released.
Last week, the bond market cheered the latest consumer confidence data -
which showed that the heady 'holiday season' optimism was waning even before
the Clinton plan was announced - and shrugged off an upward revision to
fourth-quarter gross domestic product data, which suggested that the economy
was growing at an annualised rate of 4.8 per cent.
This week, it will confront a more fulsome list of economic statistics -
from home sales and personal consumption expenditures for January to the
February unemployment figures - and some traders suggest that the market
could be volatile.
The most-closely watched data is likely to be the jobs report, due out on
Friday. Here, analysts generally expect signs of a modest strengthening in
the labour market, with the increase in payroll employment perhaps repeating
January's 106,000 rise. However, the overall unemployment rate is reckoned
to show little shift from last month's 7.1 per cent level.
Corporate issuers are not waiting to see where the market goes next. They
took full advantage of the fall in long-term interest rates last week,
issuing billions of dollars-worth of new debt.
The biggest outpouring of new paper came of Thursday, when approximately
Dollars 5.8bn-worth of issues hit the market, compounding the roller-coaster
trading. In terms of new corporate debt offerings, that represented a
one-day record, outstripping the Dollars 5.25bn-worth which was issued on
January 8 1992.
The range of companies taking advantage of the opportunity was wide - from
Georgia-Pacific, the wood products group, to Bass America, part of the UK's
Bass group.
Among the largest borrowers, however, were Dean Witter, Discover, which is
being spun off from Sears, Roebuck, with a Dollars 1.5bn offering; the
Tennessee Valley Authority, which sold Dollars 1bn of three and five-year
bonds; and Wal-Mart Stores, the fast-expanding discount retailer, which
raised Dollars 750m by issuing five-year notes and 10-year bonds.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Japanese Bonds: Yields tumble on sharp rise in yen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOND yields in Japan fell to their the lowest level since July 1987 last
week as the market took its cue from a surge in the value of the yen.
The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond No 145 closed on Friday at 3.865 per
cent, a fall of 22.5 basis points on the week. Although profit-taking before
the March financial year-end is expected to dampen the rally in the
near-term, most investors expect a further decline in yields.
In spite of denials by the government of a concerted effort to raise the yen
to reduce the country's surging trade surplus, calls from top US officials
added weight to speculation that an agreement would be reached to bolster
the currency.
The yen's sharp rise heightened fears that a fall in competitiveness of the
country's exporters would delay economic recovery. Moreover, the yen's
strength would lower imported inflationary pressure, setting the stage for a
further official discount rate cut.
Last week's spate of corporate restructuring announcements added to hopes
for lower interest rates. Nissan Motor said it would close its vehicle plant
near Tokyo by early 1995 and reduce its workforce by 5,000 to 48,000 by
1996.
Matsushita Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics
company, posted a 63 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the nine months to
December, while Nippon Telegraph and Telephone said it would reduce its
workforce of more than 200,000 by 30,000 over the next three years and cut
its 1,300 retail outlets by a third.
The unexpected announcement by NTT, strongly backed by the government, to
cut staff by encouraging early retirement of middle-aged workers, unnerved
many Japanese office workers. Economists said further corporate
restructuring announcements could hurt consumer confidence, further hitting
consumption.
Investors have rushed to the bond market since the official discount rate
cut early last month, and February's market turnover leaped by 40.6 per cent
compared with January's total to Y39,344bn.
The rally has resulted from the lack of alternative investments. The Tokyo
stock market has floundered around the 17,000 level and is not likely to
recover shortly. Demand from corporations for loans is still low as capital
investment is slow, and short term interest rates have plunged, with
three-month certificates of deposit yielding around 3.25 per cent.
While demand for bonds remains high, the market may be suffering from a lack
of liquidity, as an increasing number of bondholders are becoming reluctant
to sell due to the lack of other attractive investments. 'There's no need to
take profits because one would only plough them back into the bond market,'
says Mr Marshall Gittler, bond analyst at Merrill Lynch in Tokyo.
Bond yields could have more room to fall, if inflation is taken into
account. With inflation at around 1 per cent, the JGB 145 currently offers a
real (inflation-adjusted) yield of just under 3 per cent. Since 1989, the
real yield has averaged 3.3 per cent, ranging between 3.97 per cent and 2.63
per cent. With inflation expected to fall further, the yield could still
have more room to fall.
Meanwhile, economists predict another cut in the discount rate, currently
2.5 per cent. Mr Takashi Oshio, economist at Morgan Guaranty Trust in Tokyo,
believes the Bank of Japan will lower the discount rate around June.
The bond market may face a temporary lull as investors take profits and
adjust positions ahead of the March financial year-end. However, bond yields
could see further easing on a slow economic recovery, sluggish corporate
profits and a continuing consumer slump. The yield on the benchmark bond is
expected to fall to 3.3 per cent during the third quarter of this year.

SONY, the Japanese electronics company, is pulling out of word processor
manufacturing in a move that reflects its falling fortunes in the
highly-competitive market.
The company will cut production gradually of its PJ700 word processor and
not develop a successor. The decision reflects a growing trend within the
Japanese industry to withdraw from unprofitable products.

FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Repola holds deficit to FM810m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPOLA, the Finnish forestry and engineering group, improved its performance
in 1992 but high financing costs and difficult industry conditions meant it
still made a loss of FM810m (Dollars 136m).
The result, which compares with a FM1.43bn loss in 1991, was hit by FM709m
of exchange rate losses connected to the impact of the weaker markka on
foreign loans. The dividend was held at FM0.65 per share.
The group noted that its operating profit more than doubled to FM1.72bn from
FM656m, with half of the total arising in the final four months. It said it
benefited from cost-saving measures, divestment of unprofitable businesses
and the devaluation of the markka.
However, this profit was more than wiped out by the exchange rates losses
and other financial losses of FM1.82bn.
The group blamed low capacity utilisation, falling newsprint prices, the
divestment of the group's marine technology activities and poor
profitability within forest machine manufacture.
Repola is more positive about prospects in 1993 although it has not made a
specific forecast.
Sales expanded 7 per cent to FM23.7bn from FM22.3bn, thanks to a better
performance from all three of the group's industrial units.
Rauma, the metals and engineering unit, saw sales rise 11 per cent to
FM8.2bn, and the unit's pre-tax loss dropped to FM167m from FM609m.

FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Vard losses deepen to NKr213m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VARD, the Norwegian cruise and ferry group, reported an increase in net
losses in 1992 to NKr213.5m (Dollars 30.49m) from NKr180.9m a year earlier,
due mainly to a rise in foreign currency losses, high interest payments, and
a huge loss on the disposal of a cruise ship.
Vard forecast a weak first quarter for Kloster Cruise, its cruise business.
However, the group said it was continuing with efforts to improve its
capital structure through a disposal or equity partnership.
Last autumn, Vard declared its intention to find a partner to invest in the
cruise business.
Group revenue edged ahead to NKr5.47bn from NKr5.36bn while operating
expenses dipped to NKr4.67bn from NKr4.77bn. Net financial costs, comprising
mainly interest expenses to service debt, widened to NKr480.3m from
NKr399.81m, and foreign exchange losses shot up to NKr108.93m from NKr61.33m
in 1991. Group operating profit, however, advanced to NKr459.3m from
NKr274.4m
On the bright side, Vard's ferry business posted a record result last year.

<TEXT>
MAGNUM Corp, the Malaysian gaming and investment holding company, has
announced pre-tax profits of MDollars 310.2m (USDollars 117m) for the year
to December 31 1992. This represents an increase of 48 per cent on 1991
taxable profits of MDollars 209.2m.
Turnover reached MDollars 1.55bn, up 28 per cent on the 1991 figure.
Magnum said the improved performance was partly due to better management
controls, plus a significant increase in the sales of its lottery tickets in
Malaysia.
Magnum is one of a number of Malaysian companies chasing what are believed
to be highly-lucrative gaming projects in China.
Late last year, the com-pany announced that the Chinese authorities had
approved 'in principle' its application to run a lottery in Guang-dong
province, in southern China.

to NKr802m
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SAGA Petroleum, Norway's biggest independent oil company, posted an increase
in 1992 pre-tax profits to NKr802m (Dollars 114.5m) from NKr777m a year
earlier, helped by a rise in oil and gas sales and an increase in income
from pipeline tariffs.
Saga proposed lifting its dividend to NKr1.75 a share from 1991's NKr1.25.
Group revenue increased last year to NKr5.36bn, from NKr4.58bn, in 1991 as
operating expenses rose to NK4.11bn from NKr3.22bn. Group net profit rose to
NKr277m from NKr173m.
Saga recorded a charge of NKr119m for an unrealised currency loss on a
long-term dollar loan and also wrote down the value of its 11.7 per cent
stake in Elkem, the Norwegian light metals group, by NKr92m. Saga initially
bought a 12.4 per cent stake in Elkem two years ago for NKr460m.
Total financial charges fell last year to NKr449m from NKr588m in 1991,
while group operating profit dipped to NKr1.25bn from NKr1.37bn.
Gas sales rose to 424m cu metres from 350m a year earlier, while revenue
from pipeline tariffs reached NKr450m.
Taxes for 1992 were estimated at NKr525m, down from NKr604m in 1991.

FT  01 MAR 93 / International Company News: Philippine government takes
control of airline
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MANILA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPINE Airlines is back under government control, just over a year after
it was auctioned in the country's biggest privatisation.
Mr Gabriel Singson, president of the state-run Philippine National Bank, has
been elected chairman and president of PR Holdings, a consortium of private
and government-owned groups that acquired 67 per cent of PAL in January
1992. He replaces Mr Antonio Cojuangco, who is also president of Philippine
Long Distance Telephone.
Meanwhile, at PAL, Mr Cojuangco is to step down today as chairman and
president in favour of Mr Carlos Dominguez, a former banker and agriculture
secretary.
The appointment of two government nominees to the top positions at PR
Holdings and PAL results from a compromise reached between two rival groups
of businessmen that have fought for control of the two companies over the
past couple of months.
One group is lead by Mr Lucio Tan, a Chinese-Filipino businessman with
cigarette and banking interests who holds 40 per cent of PR Holdings. The
other group is led by Mr Cojuangco who with his allies also holds 40 per
cent.
A dispute arose over whether to purchase Dollars 1.2bn of new aircraft. The
row became increasingly bitter until Mr Fidel Ramos, the Philippine
president, intervened early last month and asked Mr Singson to work out a
scheme acceptable to the two groups.
The compromise came after Mr Andres Soriano, an ally of Mr Cojuangco, sold
his stake in PR Holdings to International Container Terminal Services which
then sided with Mr Tan.
It is not clear whether the changes represent a victory for Mr Tan. At
today's PAL board meeting to formalise the new management team, an
announcement is also expected that the airline will continue to pursue the
controversial aircraft acquisition plan.

FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Institutions back Trafalgar cash call -
Board braced for criticism from small shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAFALGAR HOUSE'S institutional shareholders have backed the group's
controversial Pounds 204.5m rights issue in advance of an extraordinary
general meeting today to approve the transaction.
Proxy votes received by Trafalgar are understood to show a clear majority in
favour of a cash call at 60p a share. Nevertheless, the board is bracing
itself for criticism from small shareholders at today's meeting.
News that the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales is
investigating the group following its decision to restate its 1991 accounts
has cast a shadow over the egm. The Institute said it had not launched any
formal investigation against the accountants associated with Trafalgar
House. Mr Andrew Colquhoun, secretary of the Institute, said the inquiry
followed automatically after the Financial Reporting Review Panel forced the
group to bring a Pounds 138m write-down on property assets into its profit
and loss account. This turned a reported Pounds 122.5m profit into a Pounds
30m loss.
Mr Colquhoun said it was too early to say whether any accountants on
Trafalgar's board would be reported to the Institute's disciplinary
committee. There are four accountants on Trafalgar's board - Mr John
Ansdell, financial director, Mr David Calverly, property division chairman,
Mr Ian Fowler, company secretary, and Sir Eric Parker, deputy chairman.
The inquiry comes as a number of Trafalgar's executives believe Hongkong
Land, which is expected to shortly take its stake up to 29.9 per cent, is
preparing to push through a series of management changes as well as bringing
in new financial advisers.
Mr Allan Gormly, Trafalgar's chief executive, said there were no planned
changes to the group's advisers, which include Kleinwort Benson and UBS
Phillips and Drew, or to the board other than those already announced. He
condemned the 'speculation' surrounding people's future and described
Trafalgar's relationship with Hongkong Land as very good.
However, the company believes that it would not be surprising if over a
period of time a number of changes were made at the behest of Hongkong Land.

HAMBROS, the merchant banking group, is completing plans to float some of
its insurance subsidiaries on the stock market and expects to go ahead with
an issue designed to raise more than Pounds 30m by the end of the month.
Hambros, which sold part of its stake in CE Heath, the insurance broker,
last year, will retain a stake of about 50 per cent in the new company,
Hambros Insurance Services Group.
The group's existing management is expected to acquire 15 per cent of the
capital, with some 35 per cent being sold to outside investors.
The flotation will be by means of a placing coupled with an intermediaries'
offer through Panmure Gordon. The new group will be chaired by Mr
Christopher Sporborg, the deputy chairman of Hambros Bank. Mr Nicholas Page
will become chief executive.
HISG, which is expected to earn profits in excess of Pounds 9m this year,
will consist of four main elements.
Cunningham Hart, one of the country's top three loss adjusters, has been
acqui-sitive in recent years, taking over IAP, a London-based firm of
international loss adjusters, and the Dutch group, Polak Schoute Beheer.
Profits in the 12 months to March 31 1992 amounted to Pounds 5.3m on
turnover of about Pounds 35m.
Hambro Legal Protection, which provides legal, medical and other advice
services by telephone helpline, selling services through companies, brokers
and other intermediaries. Its legal expenses insurance policies are
underwritten at Lloyd's.
Beale Dobie, a market maker in sales of second hand with-profit endowment
policies.
Berkeley Insurance Services, which provides advice about brokers and
intermediaries, recommending which one is appropriate to handle a particular
type of account or problem.

Bank
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Secure Trust, the financial services group, has conditionally agreed to buy
Peoples Bank from Provident Financial for Pounds 4.8m cash.
Secure said that Bradford-based Peoples served a similar customer base to
its own, would give it a presence in Yorkshire, and broaden its range of
products and services. Peoples provides personal banking services to 6,000
customers in the UK and has a loan book of more than Pounds 4m.
At December 31 it had audited net assets of Pounds 14m, though since then a
court approved capital reduction reduced this to Pounds 5m. 1992 pre-tax
profits were Pounds 318,000.

FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Relisting expected following restructure at
Fairbriar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FAIRBRIAR, the insolvent south-east based property developer which had its
shares suspended at 8p in September 1991, is likely to be relisted on the
Stock Exchange in the next few weeks.
The joint administrators from Ernst &amp; Young, the accountancy firm, have
applied to the High Court to be released from their appointment following
the approval by creditors in late January of a company voluntary
arrangement.
That would pave the way for what is believed to be the first ever example of
a British company being relisted intact since administration orders were
first introduced in the 1986 Insolvency Act.
Under a restructuring proposal accepted in late January, unsecured creditors
have been offered Pounds 400,000 in cash and 3.45m new shares in exchange
for outstanding debts.
Preferential creditors will be paid in full at Pounds 200,000. An interim
distribution is expected within four months. There will also be a
subscription of 7.67m new shares at 1p.
The Bank of Scotland will receive 4.13m ordinary shares, 8.82m convertible
preference shares and up to Pounds 10.6m in zero coupon secured loan notes.
It will extend a new working capital facility of Pounds 2.5m.
Mr Terry Carter, one of the joint administrators, said the allocation of
shares between the creditors was based on 'a horse trade'. He said Fairbriar
showed that administrations to save a company could be made to work.
He added that failure to achieve approval for the company voluntary
arrangement would have led to liquidation, with the loss of tax credits
worth tens of millions of pounds and little prospect of any dividend for
creditors.
The company's properties are valued in the balance sheet at Pounds 51.9m at
March 31 1992, against borrowings of Pounds 81.9m. Contingent claims from
unsecured creditors are believed to total about Pounds 25m.
Under the proposed restructuring, debt would be reduced to Pounds 60.3m
leaving the company with an accumulated deficit. No dividend will be paid
until this is removed.
The relisting follows approval at a series of creditors' meetings on January
22 for a company voluntary arrangement.

FT  01 MAR 93 / UK Company News: NFC sees 1993 as year of growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the transport and logistics group, yesterday forecast growth in profits
and earnings of between 6 per cent and 10 per cent this year, thanks to
acquisitions and an expected upturn in the US.
Mr Jack Mather, chief executive, said the company's 'best view' forecasts
were for profits before tax of between Pounds 95m and Pounds 100m in the
year to end-September, compared with an adjusted Pounds 89.9m last time.
Mr Mather told several thousand NFC shareholders, gathered in Nottingham for
the company's annual meeting, that first quarter profits before tax
increased 10.2 per cent to Pounds 19.5m. The logistics division increased
operating profits 48 per cent to Pounds 17.5m, helped by US growth,
favourable exchange rates and lower restructuring costs.
Neither the first quarter figures nor the profits forecast take into account
NFC's sale of its waste management subsidiary in January. The company was
sold for Pounds 113m to Wessex Waste Management, the joint venture between
Waste Management International of the US and Wessex Water.
First quarter turnover increased 12 per cent on continuing operations, while
turnover including acquisitions and disposals increased 11 per cent to
Pounds 557.4m. Interest costs increased sharply to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds
2.3m), reflecting higher borrowings to finance acquisitions.
Last year gearing increased from 29 per cent to 55 per cent.
Earnings increased 8 per cent to 2.7p. A first interim dividend of 1.35p is
being paid, a 3.8 per cent increase. Full year earnings are set to increase
from 11.7p to between 13p and 13.7p, the company said.
Mr Mather retires today and is replaced by Mr Peter Sherlock, who resigned
from Bass last year.

At the request of the independent directors of Buckingham International, the

by which Jemma Trust and Naaz Holdings must make mandatory offers for the
company.
In December the Panel ruled that Jemma and Naaz were acting in concert in
Buckingham shares and that an offer at 2.75p per ordinary share and an
appropriate offer for the secured convertible loan stock 1995 of Buckingham
were to be made by February 28 1993.
The Buckingham directors anticipate that the offers, together with the

ARTHUR SHAW, the buildings materials group, has announced further management
changes following an egm at which rebel shareholders ousted the board.
Mr Peter Ryan, the caretaker chairman, has resigned. He has been replaced by
Mr Brian Phillips, a former managing director. The moves follow the removal
of Mr Gordon Pearson and the board after shareholders backed rebel demands
for a change in direction at the loss-making group.
Mr Alan Bearman and Mr Donald Crammond, two directors on the original board
who were first ousted last August for backing the rebels and then
reappointed recently, have also stepped down.
Mr Ian Tickler, the rebel leader and Mr Pearson's predecessor, will remain a
director.
Mr Tickler, whose family controls 49 per cent of the equity, hopes to sell
the Jackdaw engineering subsidiary to reduce the group's Pounds 3.35m debt.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Crisis of confidence among business leaders: The mood of big
company bosses in continental Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FT Correspondents
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Europe's big company bosses have written off 1993; most expect
no improvement in the economic climate until next year. That is the common
theme running through conversations with leading executives in the past few
weeks.
Their eyes are fixed firmly on Germany, Europe's largest economy and one
facing some of the most difficult problems over the next few years.
German bosses have no illusions. Mr David Herman, chairman of Adam Opel, the
German arm of General Motors, paints the darkest picture. Opel will still
make profits this year, but they will be reduced. Beyond that, he makes no
guesses. 'Business confidence is not yet down at post-war lows, but the mood
trend is the steepest downward curve seen since the war.'
Mr Edzard Reuter, chairman of Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial
company, cites a similar time scale. The post-war trend of steady growth
interrupted by brief slowdowns and characterised by continuously improving
prosperity has apparently come to an end, he says. This has created a
pressing need for change in expectations and behaviour within Daimler,
German industry and German society at large.
Structural change at Daimler, including harsh cuts at the core Mercedes-Benz
motor business, is underpinned by efforts to persuade the workforce that
today's business conditions require revolutionary changes in behaviour.
'The relationship with our people and the unions should be changed,' says Mr
Herman. 'We all need to open our eyes and see things in a worldwide
perspective'.
In charge for only a few months, he is clearly shocked by the routine 10 per
cent absenteeism for sickness. 'Who would ever have dreamed that the UK
would have 50 per cent the sickness rate of Germany?'
Veba, the big German energy company, also finds local costs its most
pressing worry. 'It is essential for Germany to remain competitive in terms
of production costs', the company says, 'in order to protect market
positions against low-cost producing nations, especially in eastern Europe.'
Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank,
says the gloom spread by the current cyclical downturn has been compounded
by a revival of doubts about Germany's ability to attract investment and
broader issues of structural change.
However, he feels the depression is overdone. When the going becomes rough,
Germany tends to labour under a sort of 'hysteria' which exaggerates the
real scale of the problem, he says.
Opel's Mr Herman ascribes part of the gloomy outlook to the Bundesbank's
high interest rate policy and adverse exchange rates. 'But that's not an
issue with me', he says, 'because I can't affect it'.
If German business leaders cannot influence the Bundesbank, others feel even
more impotent. Mr Carlo De Benedetti, chairman of the Olivetti computers
group, is particularly critical of the Bundesbank's policies, which he
believes are stifling growth in Germany and exporting recession to other
European countries.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, France's biggest chemicals
group, says a cut in French and German interest rates after the elections in
France next month is indispensable. 'The state of the European economy is
worse even that during the 1973 oil-shock. I don't expect it to improve
until 1994 at the earliest,' he says. His finance director, Mr Jean-Pierre
Tirouflet, warns that without a cut in interest rates, France risks the
destruction of its industrial base.
Those who have escaped, through devaluation, from the strait-jacket of
German interest rates bless their good fortune. Mr Bo Berggren, president of
Stora, Europe's largest pulp and paper group, takes comfort in the drop in
the Swedish krona. Thanks to that, and to signs that overcapacity in pulp
and paper is gradually being absorbed, he feels relatively optimistic. 'If
things do not get substantially better in the next two years, I would be
very disappointed.'
Mr Giorgio Garuzzo, chief operating officer of Fiat, Italy's biggest private
sector company, draws comfort from the decision to take the lira out of the
exchange rate mechanism. The lira's float 'is very positive for the Italian
economy and for Fiat,' he says. Although it will probably take at least six
months, and possibly a year, for the full benefits to come through for Fiat,
'our competitiveness has been greatly enhanced'.
Demand in the Italian car market, Europe's second biggest, is a concern,
however. Last year it stayed relatively buoyant, but has been falling in
recent months. January's figures showed a fall of almost 14 per cent on the
same month the previous year.
The outlook for the European car industry is of prime concern to Mr Mauritz
Sahlin, group chief executive at SKF, the world's leading roller bearing
manufacturer. 'Consumer confidence is so low in Europe that people are
saving money rather than spending it on cars and household appliances,' he
says. 'Until consumer confidence picks up, it's not very likely that there
will be any increased demand in the European market.' In Germany, Opel's Mr
Herman says: 'Consumer confidence is in free fall.'
If those who rely on selling consumer durables such as cars are gloomy, one
man who sells lower-priced consumer goods is noticeably more cheerful. Mr
Nicolas Hayek, chairman of Switzerland's SMH, the world's largest watch
making group, sees 'many signs' of consumer confidence recovering,
especially in France, the UK and Germany.
France was also singled out for optimism by Stora's Mr Berggren, who says
firm French and improving UK markets are offsetting the downturn in Germany.
This optimism about France from its neighbours contrasts with an almost
uniformly pessimistic view from industrialists in that country. Mr Louis
Schweitzer, chairman of Renault since last year, was boasting in mid-1992 of
the company's best sales performance for a decade. He struck a far gloomier
tone two weeks ago: the group barely broke even in the final quarter,
because of sluggish sales and the handicap of the strong franc. Mr
Schweitzer has no doubt that Renault is on course for another difficult year
in 1993.
Alcatel Alsthom in electronics, LVMH in luxury goods, Pechiney in packaging
and Michelin in tyres have all experienced a deterioration in trading
conditions since the autumn; all have suffered from the rise of the franc.
Coping with a weak economic outlook is particularly hard when an industry is
undergoing wrenching technological change. Mr De Benedetti's Olivetti, like
other computer companies, is undergoing just such an experience. As a
result, analysts say, it is likely to report a 1992 net loss which could
reach L750bn (Pounds 332m). Mr De Benedetti's one dominant concern for the
group 'is to convince our large customers that we will be around in five
years'.
For some business people, it is the threat to society, rather than to their
own companies, that is the most serious concern. Mr Josef Ackermann, new
chief executive of Credit Suisse, argues that though the European economy
should start to pick up next year, an investment-led upswing will not be
strong enough to bring about a significant reduction in unemployment.
'This is cause for great concern,' he says. 'The danger of protectionism
will increase, raising the threat of a complete breakdown of the Gatt
negotiations. High unemployment in general, and mass unemployment in certain
countries, regions and cities, as well as among young people, will place the
social and political fabric under pressure.'
SMH's Mr Hayek also stresses the social threat of unemployment. 'I just hope
we will not see an extremist coming with a plan to build autobahns, as we
did 60 years ago,' he says.
Several of those interviewed stressed the need for government actions. Mr
Jorma Ollila, president of Nokia, the Finnish consumer electronics and
telecommunications, company, points to a hopeful transatlantic example: 'The
fact that we have a leader in the US who is clearly trying to address the
economic issues brings a certain amount of optimism about a healthy
long-term development there.'
Few were as positive about European governments. Daimler-Benz's Mr Reuter
says there are economic policy vacuums in European capitals. He wants a
framework industrial policy for the EC bound together by a common European
currency. 'The roots of our problems lie in the lack of convincing European
solutions,' he says.
Mr Leonardo Vannotti, president of Ascom, the Swiss telecommunications
manufacturer, speaks for others when he asks: 'How can I be optimistic when
I do not see any concerted action in Europe to get things moving?'

FT  01 MAR 93 / Lonrho in talks with Gencor to raise cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONRHO, the international trading group, is in talks with Gencor, South
Africa's biggest mining house, about a cash raising exercise which could see
its shareholding in Western Platinum reduced to 51 per cent.
The proposals are part of the group's recently unveiled strategy of reducing
debt by selling stakes in core businesses. Lonrho has put the value of
Western Platinum at Pounds 1bn, though independent brokers say it is worth
only half that.
Lonrho wants to wipe out the borrowings of the three platinum mines, which
have risen to more than R800m (Pounds 180.5m).
Talks between Lonrho and Gencor, which has a 27 per cent stake in Lonrho's
platinum assets, have been under way since the end of last year.
According to a Lonrho executive the group has narrowed its options down to
three proposals:
Gencor would buy a further 22 per cent of the platinum mines, taking its
stake to 49 per cent.
The platinum mines would be floated off as a separate company on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange.
Lonrho's platinum assets would be put into one of its existing investment
companies, such as Tweefontein United Collieries, which is quoted on the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange. The investment company would then have a rights
issue to raise funds.
It is understood that Lonrho directors hope the talks will reach a
conclusion within a fortnight. An announcement may then come as early as
this month.
However, the recent fall in the prices of precious metals means all three
proposals would be more expensive than first envisaged. Since the beginning
of the year the price of rhodium has fallen from Dollars 1,800 an ounce to
around Dollars 1,450, while the value of platinum fell from Dollars 370 an
ounce to Dollars 350.
Lonrho last year broke off merger talks with Gencor when it decided to a
deal with Mr Dieter Bock, the German financier. Mr Bock joined the group's
board as joint chief executive with Mr Tiny Rowland. Lonrho decided against
merging with Gencor because it did not want to be South African controlled.
Mr Rowland has said the group only needed 51 per cent of its key assets to
retain control.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Airtours expected to raise bid for Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS IS today expected to increase the terms of its hostile all-share
bid for rival holiday group, Owners Abroad, to 135p a share, 20p higher than
the market price at Friday's close. The new bid will value Owners Abroad at
about Pounds 270m, up from Pounds 225m.
The new terms are likely to involve Airtours raising its three-for-eight
share offer to 15 of its own shares for 24 Owners Abroad shares. Airtours is
not, however, expected to increase the partial cash alternative unless the
Owners Abroad board recommends the bid.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, and Mr David Crossland, Airtours
chairman, met last Wednesday - as did their advisers on Friday - but failed
to agree terms for a recommended bid.
Airtours is understood to believe its target is holding out for too high a
price. Owners Abroad's advisers say its rival has failed to appreciate the
value of the proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel agents and
financial services company controlled by the German state bank, Westdeutsche
Landesbank.
On Friday Owners Abroad posted its last defence document to shareholders.
This followed the decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, not to refer Airtours' bid to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. Airtours must post its last document including any substantial
new information to Owners Abroad shareholders by this Friday.

The impression in the west that chaos and confusion are overwhelming both
Russian politics and the economy is only partly true.
The paradox is that in spite of its mounting troubles, Russia has perhaps
come closer to grappling with crucial reforms than ever before.
The west, which has much to lose if attempts at a relatively peaceful
transition to a market economy collapse, also has a good opportunity to help
the best reformist government that Russia is likely to get in the
foreseeable future.
For in spite of the drama surrounding the power struggle between President
Yeltsin and the parliamentary chairman, the threat of hyperinflation is
helping to focus at least some minds on the need for painful macroeconomic
stabilisation.
An unprecedented growth of money supply - culminating in the issue of
Rbs1,600bn of central bank credit in December alone, or 60 per cent of
national income - helped push weekly price increases to hyperinflationary
heights of 10 per cent a week in January.
With inflation back down to 5 per cent a week, the government on Wednesday
finalised a plan to restrict money supply growth to 7 per cent a month. This
would be accompanied by selective support for state-owned enterprises, and
continuing to build badly-needed market institutions.
Many of the pre-conditions for effective reform which were missing last year
are also now in place.
As inflation fuelled by an unprecedented growth in money supply has ravaged
living standards, the government no longer needs to justify financial
austerity as part of a comprehensive reform package it is now trying to
implement.
The government is also finally forcing other former Soviet republics to drop
the rouble as their currency unless they co-ordinate monetary and credit
policy with it.
Bankruptcy and other key legislation is in place. The country is now even
building proper borders with other republics which should help it implement
foreign exchange controls.
And in spite of dismay over the fall of Mr Yegor Gaidar, the reformist prime
minister who launched economic shock therapy but abandoned it under
political pressure, the government itself has become more effective since
his departure.
Mr Boris Fyodorov, the new deputy prime minister for economics and finance,
has both the expertise and the time which Mr Gaidar never had as prime
minister, to focus on what he calls the 'elaboration and detailisation' of
the Gaidar strategy.
For this he has the support of Mr Viktor Chernomyrdin, the new prime
minister who has the advantage of being elected by parliament and therefore
does not need to constantly fight for his political survival.
What happens next largely depends on talks between the government and the
central bank, described by a government economist as 'a lengthy persuasion
process'.
The central bank has come back with counter-proposals to those of the
government which include setting money supply growth at 20 per cent a month.
But the bargaining has only just begun.
Previously, the government engaged in political polemics by blaming the
central bank for the failure of last year's stabilisation attempts.
Now, Mr Fyodorov is working hard to reform the relationship so that both
sides recognise their responsibilities: the central bank to defend the
currency, and the government to implement the economic reform it has talked
about.
Mr Fyodorov also wants the central bank to restrict the government to
commonly agreed credit expansion limits. And he believes the government
should pay a higher interest rate for central bank credits. At present it
has paid just 10 per cent a year, compared with 80 per cent paid by
commercial banks.
Such a practice would in turn mean admitting to a much bigger budget deficit
than the 5 per cent of Gross Domestic Product proclaimed last year and
planned in earnest for this year. If cheap credits to the government were
factored into the calculation, the deficit would be closer to 30 per cent .
This is where the west, which last year found a convenient excuse to wait
and see about financial aid as Mr Gaidar failed to live up to promises made
to the IMF, can make a big difference.
Tied to specific conditions such as the selective distribution of credit to
enterprises and the building of a social safety net, western transfers would
lessen the hyperinflationary pressures caused by printing money to cover
spending which cannot be cut overnight.
Continued technical assistance is also vital, with focus on the provinces
rather than Moscow, which is already saturated with foreign advice.
While some of Russia's problems are connected to internal politics,
including the present conflict between the executive and the legislative
branches, fear and ignorance over what should be done is even greater.
A few regions of Russia are boldly pressing ahead with reform with the help
of western advisers. Others, though, fearing unpopularity and not knowing
any better, are falling back on the even more dangerous formula of
half-baked reform.
Another danger is Russia's old habit of preferring talk over action, and
setting up new rules and superfluous structures to tackle old problems.
Typical is the recent establishment of a new presidential body to attract
foreign investment (duplicating an existing government agency which itself
replaced a committee), when what is really needed is the removal of very
basic obstacles to investment.
It is more important than ever that the west should not be cowed by the
confusion in Russia, but should declare itself ready to provide targeted
assistance as soon as the authorities produce some proof of their resolve.
President Bill Clinton, who has some well-informed Russia experts in his
administration and meets President Yeltsin on April 4, would do well to
consider providing the leadership for a concerted western aid policy whose
time has now come.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Yeltsin seeks peacekeeper role: Russian leader wants right
to curb conflicts on his borders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and JUREK MARTIN

   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin told the international community yesterday that
Russia must be given a free hand to act as guarantor of peace in the former
Soviet bloc, possibly with special powers granted by the United Nations.
Fresh from a 12-day break at a country house near Moscow, the Russian leader
said he believed 'the world community is increasingly coming to understand
Russia's special responsibility in this difficult task'.
His country had 'a heartfelt interest' in suppressing conflicts round its
borders, he told an open meeting of the political council of the influential
centrist Civic Union bloc.
'The moment has come when responsible international institutions, including
the United Nations, should grant Russia special powers as guarantor of peace
and stability in the region of the former (Soviet) Union,' Mr Yeltsin said.
At the same time, he stepped up the battle at home over the division of
power between president and parliament.
He warned his opponents he would no longer tolerate their blocking of
constitutional and economic reform. He did not feel bound by oath to the
present constitution, which is a patched up version of the old Soviet era
document. 'If we refuse to divide powers, we will get dictatorship or
anarchy,' he said.
The strength of his latest call for more power for the president appears to
indicate he is contemplating decisive action soon in the power struggle.
Mr Yeltsin's warning to the international community comes at a time when
western states are in despair at their inability to control the fighting in
former Yugoslavia. The Russian president appears to be assuming that major
foreign states would not protest too much about Russian 'peace keeping' in
the former Soviet Union where there are similar nationalistic disputes.
The remarks also signal that Russia is no longer willing to accept the
fiction of being one among equals in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
Russian troops are already enmeshed in fighting in Georgia and Tajikistan;
holding an uneasy peace in Moldova; and in the Baltics where tension is
rising between the native and Russian populations. There is also tension
between Russia and Ukraine over the Black Sea fleet.
Jurek Martin, in Washington, writes: On the question of Russia's economic
and political reform, Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state,
yesterday offered an unqualified endorsement of US support for Mr Yeltsin,
who is due to meet President Bill Clinton on April 4.
Mr Christopher said in a television interview that the Russian president's
convictions in favour of 'greater democracy and freedom' made him 'in our
estimate the best choice in Russia'.

FT  01 MAR 93 / China boxes clever for the Olympics with US match
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A drab stadium in Beijing on Saturday night, the workers of China came
face to face with the blood, sweat and hoopla of American professional
boxing. It was billed as the 'Brawl at the Wall'.
The promoter, Mr Harold Smith, appeared elegantly attired in a dinner
jacket. Local girls, in short white skirts and matching tops, semaphored
each new round. Many in the crowd, bemused and exhilarated by the spectacle,
had spent a month's wages on a single ticket.
Muhammad Ali, boxing envoy, former world champion and sporting icon, was
introduced to the cheering crowd. He raised his arm in acknowledgement of
the greeting.
Mr Han, a producer for Chinese television, which was broadcasting the event
to millions, caught the mood of joyful puzzlement: 'It's crazy, but I like
it.'
If China, preparing a bid to host the Olympics in 2000, needed a lesson in
sports promotion, it certainly got one. Fighters were greeted on their
arrival in the ring with their signature tunes blaring from amplifiers.
A honey-voiced American ring announcer boomed out their details. The bill
included five bouts, featuring 10 boxers, whose abilities were not
undersold. At the ringside sat the American promoters, managers, attorneys,
wives, mistresses, girlfriends, sponsors and other assorted hangers-on.
Among many bizarre moments during a long night which combined American and
Chinese entrepreneurship in unlikely circumstances was the brief opening
ceremony. Hardened veterans of the American fight game became misty-eyed at
the playing of the US national anthem on the site where not many years ago
mass rallies were held to denounce American imperialists and all their
works.
When American Leeonzer Barber retained his World Boxing Organisation (WBO)
light-heavyweight crown over countrymen Mike Sedillo, it was probably the
first time a world title fight had been staged on Chinese soil, certainly
since the communist revolution in 1949, and perhaps for many years before.
China's rulers banned boxing as cruel, exploitative and capitalist, but in
1986 the ban was lifted after the Chinese began to move back into the
mainstream of international sport.
Entering into the diplomatic spirit of the occasion the fighters - nine out
of the 10 were Americans - said they had come on a mission of peace, never
mind that inside the ring several exhibited murderous intent.
Chinese media reporting revealed a certain lack of expertise. A reporter for
the official New China news agency described as a 'demonstration' the first
bout between a hulking Kevin Ford and a puny, by comparison, Keith McMurray.
This is likely to have been news to a battered McMurray who was sent
crashing to the canvas several times.
The Chinese promoters made little secret of their motives for staging the
'Brawl at the Wall': 'Of course, we see this as part of our campaign to
stage the Olympics,' said one official.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Opposition mounts to widening Brussels' merger role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE, Germany and the UK have joined forces to oppose any expansion of the
European Commission's powers to vet large mergers when EC rules come up for
review this autumn.
The governments in Bonn, Paris and London have indicated to Brussels that
they will resist moves to lower the turnover thresholds above which the EC's
competition authorities automatically investigate deals affecting the EC
market.
Brussels officials last week said the Commission remained 'neutral' on the
matter of thresholds. At present, Brussels looks at all mergers involving
companies with a combined turnover of Ecus5bn (Pounds 6.1bn).
Last December, Sir Leon Brittan, then EC competition commissioner, said
existing thresholds were too high. Mr Karel van Miert, his successor, has
yet to comment. But if he does propose lower thresholds, he will face strong
opposition from France, Germany and the UK which see the matter as a test
case for 'subsidiarity' - the principle that powers should be devolved to
the most appropriate national or regional authority.
Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, has suggested scaling back the
Commission's competition powers, starting with higher thresholds for merger
investigations. Paris was incensed in 1991 when the Commission blocked a
Franco-Italian takeover of de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft-maker - the
only merger so far rejected under the 1990 EC merger rules.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of the Office of Fair Trading in
London, is reported to view an increase in Brussels' jurisdiction as
premature.
Similarly, the Bundeskartellamt in Berlin believes that, after only two
years of operating the new rules, it is too soon to make a judgment on
change. A senior Bundeskartellamt official suggested that Germany was
pushing first for other reforms, specifically more open decision-making in
Brussels.
The Commission is conducting a wide-ranging review of its September 1990
merger rules. Consultations with industry, lawyers and governments are
likely to be wrapped up in a fortnight, at which point the Commission must
decide whether to push for more powers. Mr Van Miert must table any
amendments by the end of the year for approval by member states.
The EC's merger task force, the special unit set up within the Commission
competition directorate, has won praise for its speed and comparative
efficiency in examining more than 300 cases over the past two and a half
years.
The Commission is also examining whether to bring all joint ventures under
the merger rules, and whether to allow companies to amend their deals to win
approval during the preliminary inquiry.

FT  01 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: UK gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The gilts market is whipping itself into a frenzy of anticipation about a
change to the full funding rule in the Budget. Today sees yet another
recommendation to that effect, this time from Midland Montagu. At this rate
the market will be very disappointed if Mr Lamont does not oblige. That must
be doubly irksome to the Treasury. The main advantage of conceding the
change would not have been immediate sales of gilts to banks: the yield
curve is not nearly steep enough to tempt them and even Treasury bills are
too expensive. But the authorities would have derived tactical gain by
announcing the change as a surprise. They could then have funded
aggressively into a rising market.
Indeed, if Mr Lamont can pull something out of the hat to make the market
feel good, this would still be a sensible Budget day strategy. Tax
concessions to retail buyers of gilts would help, as would a downward
revision of the PSBR. More effective would be a foreign currency borrowing
programme. That would be controversial but it makes more sense to borrow
abroad with sterling at DM2.33 than it did to defend a higher parity within
the ERM.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The poker game between Mr Chris Patten and the Chinese government gets more
absorbing, not least because it is unclear who is bluffing. By rallying to
within an ace of all-time highs, the market clearly believes a fudge will be
agreed behind the scenes, presumably with the British doing most of the
backing down. Such a deal is also expected to include agreement on the new
airport and associated large construction contracts.
That view may be too sanguine, given the void between Mr Patten's public
position and the apparently implacable Chinese opposition. Even if the gap
can be bridged it will take time, and the market will not keep patience for
ever. Besides, the Legislative Council is no longer just a rubber stamp and
requires a reasonable period to debate the proposals before the end of the
session in July. If Mr Patten cedes too much to Beijing, he may also get
flak from the democratic reformers who, thus far, have been his main
support. None of that will lower the political temperature in the colony,
however much the business community wants to hush up the whole affair. The
market thus remains vulnerable, all the more so since over half the Hang
Seng's earnings still come from property, which can hardly move to safer
shores.

FT  01 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: GEC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are echoes of the 1980s about GEC. Recovery, when it arrives, will
once again challenge GEC's cash holdings, while the company faces new
management issues. Lord Weinstock has devolved responsibility for many of
the best hopes to joint ventures. Running the defence operations is the
management of long-term decline. Striking out in a radically new strategic
direction hardly fits with the company's careful culture.
That caution has done the company no harm with the market recently, despite
the fall in interest rates. In part that is because some of the company's
cash is held in French francs within GEC-Alsthom, and so has been insulated
from the fall in UK rates. But the yield premium on the shares has also
fallen as fund managers have revalued the company's financial strength and
ability to grow its dividends ahead of the market average. GEC now yields
only slightly more than the FT-A All-Share index but is still generating
cash and has a dividend cover of 1.9 times.
Operations, however, look less rosy. Defence is fighting for profits in a
declining market. The gradual run-down of the BT System X business also puts
the telecoms operations on the defensive. Only the GEC-Alsthom power systems
and transport joint venture offers the prospect of significant growth, but
that division contributed only 22 per cent of last year's profits. Perhaps
the company is holding its cash to force good terms from the government for
GEC investment in public projects, but that may come to nothing. And however
good the dividend record in the 1980s, Lord Weinstock's reluctance to spend
may be extended to shareholders if he believes lower dividend cover would
cramp his room for manoeuvre.

FT  01 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Dividend dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The moment of truth arrives for Barclays Bank this week when it must decide
on its dividend for 1992. The stock market assumes the payout will be
maintained despite large property lending losses. But should Barclays
blithely pay a dividend out of reserves as if nothing adverse had occurred?
The question, if the bank and its shareholders are being honest, is far from
easy.
A bad reason for doing so would be to save the skin of Mr Andrew Buxton, the
bank's executive chairman who was managing director for a period from 1988
when much of the bad property lending was approved. A cut dividend would
almost certainly set the City baying for blood. It might no longer be
possible for Mr Buxton to satisfy his critics simply by splitting the
functions of chairman and chief executive.
Yet a cut dividend could also imply the bank was gloomy about its own
prospects despite the succession of interest rate cuts since last September.
The signal would be seriously misleading if the real reason was to atone for
past mistakes. Barclays would have some justification for maintaining its
dividend if it felt confident of continued growth in operating income -
provided the cost to its reserves did not impair its ability to finance
higher lending in the recovery. Having squandered the proceeds of its 1988
rights issue, it can scarcely ask shareholders for more.
All other things being equal, an unchanged final dividend costing around
Pounds 195m would knock only about 20 basis points off Barclays' tier one
capital ratio. That would leave it at around 5.7 per cent, substantially
above National Westminster's 5.2 and comfortable enough for this year. But
that assumes no more nasty surprises in this week's results. Barclays must
also decide if it will be able to retain enough future earnings to rebuild
reserves going forward. That is the test for the dividend. Even if it
passes, shareholders should still ask why a system of collective
responsibility for lending decisions turned out to be a system that
effectively absolves management of any responsibility.

<TEXT>
Not everyone believes that Battersea power station is God's gift to the
London landscape. But Victor Hwang, who has the job of explaining why his
Hong Kong family is venturing where even the UK's most hardened property
developers fear to tread, insists that he doesn't want to pull it down.
The 39-year-old Victor is no stranger to Britain. Along with his other three
brothers, he was educated at Lindisfarne College. He says his father chose
to send his boys to a minor British public school in north Wales because he
wanted to keep them well out of the way of London's Chinese community.
However, the Hwangs' arrival on the 31-acre Battersea power station site has
caught the attention of not just the London Chinese. What is it that the
Hwang boys have spotted that has escaped London's canny property types?
Victor remains tight-lipped on his family's plans for London's famous
landmark. All he will say is that he probably won't turn the power station
into a hotel, because 'it doesn't have any windows'.

<TEXT>
Whatever might be said about Lady Thatcher, her loyalty to her old business
heroes is admirable. When TV-am lost its breakfast slot, Lady Thatcher wrote
to tell chairman Bruce Gyngell how heartbroken she was, especially since she
was partly responsible for the legislation which lost TV-am its franchise.
Now it seems she has been consoling Lord King who has lost his British
Airways chairmanship somewhat earlier than planned. According to yesterday's
Sunday Times a lady called Margaret phoned Lord King to say: 'I just wanted
to tell you, you were the greatest achievement of my years in office. I am
so proud of you.'
Whatever the truth of the tale, it is clear that Lord King has not lost his
sense of humour judging by his performance at last week's annual dinner of
the Institution of Electrical Engineers, where he recounted the story of a
hungry mouse. Every time it tried to venture out of its hole, it was
terrified by a loud feline 'miaow'.
Eventually the 'miaows' were replaced by a dog's bark. Thinking that the
coast was clear, the mouse ventured out, only to be pounced upon by the cat.
Moral of the tale: it pays to learn a second language, even if you are a
cat.

Top marks to Britain's life assurance industry for resourcefulness under
enemy fire and braving a counter-attack in face of hopeless odds.
Under assault from regulators and customers provoked by the sales agents'
high-pressure tactics, the industry has mounted the classic defence. It has
commissioned a survey showing that six in every seven people think life
insurance is valuable if not essential.
Among the survey's more astounding findings is that 70 per cent of
respondents actually agreed that policy-buyers who cash them in early
deserve to lose out financially. The number believing the sales agent should
bear the penalty was only 7 per cent.
In the meantime, however, Observer hears that the industry has also launched
a less conventional undercover operation. Companies ranging from Allied
Dunbar to Legal &amp; General have begun rattling people's letter boxes with
unsolicited suggestions that they might like to change career and become
'financial consultants'.
One recipient is singer-songwriter Dilly Keane, formerly with the
Fascinating Aida trio. She reported on radio the other day that she had just
had a second such approach, from Allied Dunbar.
The company's John Morgan, who wrote the letter, said Keane's name was
obtained from a marketing company with a very high success rate. So far,
though, the only actual recruit from show business was a certain Dennis
Lipton, whose wife used to run a stripper-gram enterprise.

FT  01 MAR 93 / No longer a superficial wound: The profits squeeze is
forcing Japanese companies to rethink how they do business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES LEADBEATER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Japanese companies are admitting an unpalatable truth. Their success in the
late 1980s was partly a mirage, which disguised some strategic misadventures
and a lack of discipline about costs.
Last week, corporate Japan made its realisation public. Nissan, the
carmaker, announced plans to shut a domestic production plant in a drive to
save Y200bn (Pounds 1.2bn) in three years, with a cut of 5,000 in its
workforce of 53,000. NTT, the telecommunications group, plans to cut 30,000
jobs by 1996.
Restructuring has become publicly acceptable. Nissan and NTT have opened the
way for other companies to announce plans to halt a three-year slide in
profits.
That fall was set off by the slowdown in economic growth after the the rapid
acceleration of the late 1980s. But Japanese companies face more than simply
a cyclical slump in demand.
They are starting to acknowledge a deeper malaise. Operating profitability
for all industrial companies declined in the 1980s, owing to a steady rise
in costs. In addition, the car and electronics companies, which have been
the industrial engines of Japan's growth, face saturated domestic markets.
So as companies start cutting costs, they are facing more troubling
questions about the way they do business. Have they reached the limits of
their traditional methods of management? Will their profits improve only if
they retreat from what they have stood for - lifetime employment, a wide
array of trend-setting products and a constant effort to expand market
share?
The problem stems from the costs left over from the high growth of the late
1980s. The increase in investment between 1986 and 1990 has left behind a
depreciation charge which has risen to 4.5 per cent of manufacturing
industry's sales. Personnel costs have increased, because white-collar
employment in manufacturing has expanded by almost a fifth since 1985.
Labour costs per head last year were 25 per cent higher than in 1988.
Japanese companies were able to carry these costs on two conditions: high
rates of growth and cheap capital. With the collapse of the speculative
bubble economy of the late 1980s, those conditions have evaporated. The
result has been a severe profits squeeze. Total profits earned by the
industrial sector in Japan this year could be half the level they were in
March 1990, according to Mr Peter Norton, chief strategist at Baring
Securities.
Until this winter the corporate response to the profits squeeze was
superficial. Cuts in executive salaries of up to 15 per cent at companies
such as Omron, the electrical machinery maker, have been commonplace. Nippon
Steel started locking its doors at the weekend to reduce overtime. The
elimination of new-year cards saved the company about Y3m.
Job reductions were confined to workers on the fringe of companies'
full-time workforces. JVC, the electronics group, shed about 1,500
part-timers. Kanebo, the textiles and cosmetics group, is retiring 300
workers over the official retirement age.
Deep cuts in investment are widespread and more than superficial. But they
will not yield big short-term savings. Nissan is cutting investment by 15
per cent, but its depreciation charge will rise from Y96.9bn in 1990 to
Y160bn next year to pay for its past investment.
Until this year most companies had limited themselves to measures such as
these. But last month something changed. Companies began to recognise that
the downturn would be protracted. A new phase of restructuring began, which
typically involves a combination of:
Changes in senior management. The president of Matsushita, the ailing
electronics giant, last week resigned to take responsibility for its poor
performance. Bridgestone, the tyremaker, has taken the unprecedented step of
appointing as president an executive from its highly decentralised chemical
division who has extensive overseas experience.
Much deeper staff cuts. Iseki, which makes rice-planting machines, plans to
cut its workforce by a fifth to 2,300 by November 1995. Mazda, the carmaker,
has transferred 5,000 administrative staff to its production lines.
Retreating from new businesses. Taking advantage of cheap credit in the
1980s, many companies entered the high-growth electronics markets. Now
chemicals group Ube Industries, for example, is withdrawing from making
floppy discs.
Companies are cutting product ranges to make production simpler and reduce
development costs. Nissan plans to cut the number of options it offers with
its models - such as styles of steering wheel, or interior design - by 35
per cent in three years.
The proliferation of products in the past decade often generated large costs
but little revenue. Ajinomoto, the food group, plans to halve its product
range to 2,500 items after finding that 40 per cent of its products
contributed only 3 per cent of its sales.
Revising corporate structure. Sanyo, the electronics group, has replaced its
centralised divisions with eight business units, each responsible for its
own profitability under the slogan 'No excuses'.
Reducing such costs is a quick way to boost profitability. A 5 per cent cut
in administrative costs at the average manufacturer would improve operating
profits by more than 25 per cent, said Mr Norton.
But cost-cutting on this scale may not be enough to help manufacturers
respond to the longer-term pressures they face: more expensive capital; a
decline in prices for electronic goods; mounting competition from low-cost
Asian producers, especially in traditional industries such as textiles; and
the prospect that Japan's maturing economy will grow only slowly in the
1990s.
These pressures mean further restructuring to come.
International strategies are likely to be reassessed. More companies may
follow Shimizu, the construction group, which is pulling out of the UK and
Australia. Japanese companies may start to retreat from their ambitious
investment plans for the US and Europe, in favour of investment in low-cost
production plants in the high-growth economies of south-east Asia.
Within Japan, there is likely to be consolidation in whole sectors of
industry. A 30 per cent fall in paper prices since 1989 has already forced
Kanzaki Paper Manufacturing, the seventh largest paper-maker, to merge with
Oji Paper, the largest. That followed plans for a merger between Jujo Paper
and Sanyo Kokusaku Pulp.
The car industry, with nine manufacturers competing over a slowing market,
is another candidate for consolidation. There may have been room for nine
manufacturers in the 1960s, when automobile ownership in Japan was growing
at an annual rate of about 37 per cent. But in the next few years most
analysts expect ownership to grow by about 3 per cent at most. That may not
be enough to sustain them all. The tie-up between Honda and Isuzu announced
late last year could be the first step in a wider rationalisation of the
industry.
The heavily overpopulated electronics industry could also consolidate. One
senior executive admitted: 'We will no longer be able to make the profits we
need just from making hardware. No matter how efficient we are, it just
cannot be done.'
For the electronics companies, cost-cutting will not be enough. They need
new strategies to take them further into high-growth areas, such as
software.
As Japan's companies embark upon such changes, they have large resources to
draw upon: highly educated workforces employed in efficient, modern
factories. They also have a big incentive: the large productivity gains to
be reaped from cutting into bloated administrative and office divisions.
Moreover, the financial pressure upon them is unlikely to ease. Since
previous periods of restructuring in the 1970s and 1980s, the relationship
between the Japanese finance sector and industry has changed significantly.
In the 1970s, when companies restructured after the oil shock, they relied
upon the patient support of their banks. In the 1980s, large companies
turned to capital markets for their finance.
Now the banks have their own problems with mounting bad loans. The Tokyo
stock market is in the doldrums and Japanese investors are wary. The
international capital markets will provide funds, but they will demand that
Japanese companies make an internationally competitive return on investment.
That will maintain the pressure for improved profitability.
As Japan's companies start stripping themselves down to their competitive
core, many appear to be introspective and uncertain. When they emerge, in
three or four years, however, they may be more competitive than ever before.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK'S report on the collapse of the London Ambulance Service's new
computer for despatching vehicles to emergencies makes sorry reading. The
computer system crashed after a series of management failures, plunging the
capital's ambulance service into chaos. The LAS chairman has resigned and
reforms are under way, but there are lessons here for all the public
services.
In the health service, as in other key public services, the government has
delegated management responsibility to a series of quangos. These are
usually dominated by professional managers and by business executives;
elected representatives of the local community have often been excluded. The
aim is to work along more businesslike lines, giving managers more freedom.
Much of this revolution in the management of public services is valuable and
long-overdue. It has also required determination, given the opposition of
many who work in the public services. But in its haste to force through
change, the government has given inadequate attention to the question of
accountability. It is not enough for public services to be efficient: they
must be accountable to those who pay for them.
This accountability can often be exercised through choice. Parents, for
example, can choose between different state schools, patients between
competing family doctors. But where there is a monopoly - as, currently,
with the ambulance service - mechanisms are needed to ensure that the
taxpayer who pays the piper calls the tune.
That was manifestly not the case under the arrangements for managing
London's ambulances. It was obvious to patients, doctors and hospital
administrators that the service was quite inadequate. Yet the LAS board
failed to remedy those defects: it demanded too little information to make
informed judgments; and it was too ready to accept the assurances of senior
managers that problems were being resolved. The regional health authority
responsible for the ambulance service was reluctant to interfere, since it
had delegated responsibility to the LAS board.
The problems were exacerbated by a management style which created a 'fear of
failure', mistakenly believed to be modelled on best private-sector
practice. This put undue pressure on managers to meet over-ambitious targets
and to ignore obvious difficulties. It also undervalued good communications
between managers and staff, leaving an atmosphere of mistrust.
If similar failures are to be avoided in the future, the government must
ensure that clear lines of managerial and public accountability are
established when responsibility for services is delegated to quangos. With
similar reforms now mooted for the police, it would be unforgiveable if the
lessons of the London Ambulance Service were not learnt.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Personal View: Growth for sale at One Stop Shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GRAYSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers recently looked at every known scheme around the world for
helping small businesses. To their amazement, it seems that every form of
scheme has either been started or subsequently tried in the UK. Britain is a
great inventor of 'schemes' for small business.
But many schemes have confused social objectives (cutting unemployment) with
economic goals (maximising wealth creation). They have often been
under-funded, chopped and changed, or run by people not trained to provide
the necessary quality of service. The sheer multiplicity has bewildered
clients: few schemes have had sufficient marketing to reach their target
audience, and running them separately has raised costs and reduced
effectiveness and led to 'turf wars'.
As Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, declared last July: 'I
tell you frankly, we can no longer afford to continue to waste our
collective energy on this unhelpful debate.'
Mr Heseltine has just run a national competition to pilot the idea of 'One
Stop Shops' for business support. He wants the shops to target those with
the aspiration and potential to grow. These are the people who will really
contribute to wealth creation and to Britain's international
competitiveness. This is not picking winners, but developing them. It cannot
be done by national government, but by good business advisers who can spot
and nurture such businesses because they have seen a client's commitment and
ambition over time.
A common complaint about business advice agencies is that the information
they give is too general. Information technology, however, makes it possible
to identify what businesses in a particular area and sector are asking for.
Mr Heseltine has stressed that the shops must make the most of new
technologies. They will need to be on-line to commercial databases, and to
be connected to each other by electronic mail so that inquiries unknown to
one shop can be checked out with others.
Sharing expertise might be reinforced if shops have both a geographic
responsibility and sectoral specialisms. IT would also allow video
presentations and conferences in which business advisers and individual
companies could participate via each shop.
Considerable resources are already being spent through training and
enterprise councils, chambers of commerce, enterprise agencies and local
councils to help small firms. The impact could be greatly enhanced, but it
is necessary to be realistic about what activities can become self-financing
and what will need subsidy. Public money for One Stop Shops should clearly
be for outcomes - not inputs. It should not, for example, be linked to
'bottoms on seats' on training courses, but to improvements in the client's
business performance.
Banks and companies such as Shell and BT have given large amounts of cash,
people and expertise to enterprise agencies and other small business
initiatives during the past 15 years. Apart from maintaining existing
commitments, larger firms can help the One Stop Shops through making
available expertise and contacts - for example, in total quality management,
'green' auditing and supplier opportunities.
The government has repeatedly emphasised the distinction between policy
formulation and delivery of services. There is no reason why the Department
of Trade and Industry should deliver services such as consultancy or export
advice to companies. In time, most of these can be contracted out to the One
Stop Shops.
Once established, it is essential that shops enjoy a period of stability and
continuity - and that they are clearly seen not as a government scheme but
as local partnerships in which government (not just the DTI) is an active
partner.
Cynics believe these One Stop Shops will end up as just one more government
scheme. However, combining the vision of a political heavyweight such as Mr
Heseltine with the emerging consensus among business support organisations
on the ground, a 'once in a decade' opportunity is being given to achieve a
national network of business advice centres setting world-class standards.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Bankers and small business
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RELATIONS BETWEEN Britain's high-street banks and its small and medium-sized
businesses are under severe strain as the recession drags on. Talk of the
renewal of a British 'enterprise culture' during the 1980s has rung
increasingly hollow as the number of small company failures has grown. Their
banks have been unable to get back overdrafts and short-term loans secured
on property that has fallen in value.
The number of company insolvencies in England and Wales rose from 9,400 in
1988 to some 22,000 in 1991. A continued attrition appears inevitable as
banks burned by bad debts refuse loans to highly geared businesses. Nearly
half of National Westminster's Pounds 1.3bn provision in UK branch banking
last year was against loans of less than Pounds 50,000.
In this unhappy climate, one bank chief executive has suggested that the
system of financing small business should be fundamentally rethought. Mr
Brian Pearse, of HSBC's Midland Bank, says that a 'partnership' of banks,
businesses and the government is required to wean smaller companies from
their addiction to short-term debt financing.
Mr Pearse has a number of ideas. He thinks the government should provide tax
breaks to individuals who invest in equity capital for local businesses. He
also believes Britain should imitate the German KfW bank by providing a
subsidy so that banks can provide medium and long-term loans at 1 percentage
point above base rates, rather than the current 2 to 3 points.
Mr Pearse does not absolve banks from blame. He thinks they need to improve
risk assessment, and offer businesses new forms of debt finance. But many
will sniff self-interest in his plan. The banks have weakened their capital
by paying out uncovered dividends in the past few years. Although Midland's
capital is now backed by that of its parent, UK banks would like to be eased
over the awkward phase before retained profits recover. Shareholders who are
unhappy at their record might well hesitate to subscribe to fresh rights
issues. This suggests the government should exercise caution before offering
even the Pounds 67m Mr Pearse believes his scheme would cost at most.
This does not detract from the validity of his more general point, that
British financing of small businesses requires a rethink. Many businesses
have been tempted into accepting an excess of short-term debt from banks by
the lack of equity alternatives. One recent study found that 58 per cent of
debt held by small companies in Britain was in the form of overdrafts,
compared with only 14 per cent in Germany.
Midland is not alone in thinking incentives are needed to lessen this
dependence. Several business organisations have called on Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, to provide tax incentives to increase capital in his
forthcoming budget. Corporation tax is biased against equity funding and
capital gains tax is set at 40 per cent - the same as the top rate of
personal income tax. Mr Lamont will be right to respond.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Leading Article: India's budget
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE some welcome surprises in Mr Manmohan Singh's third budget,
unveiled on Saturday. In floating the rupee and sharply cutting tariffs, he
has gone further than expected and shown that he remains committed to
reforming and opening up India's economy. Exporters and foreign investors
should draw encouragement.
However, the flourish of Mr Singh's delivery cannot disguise his dual
purpose. Almost all the measures can be justified as extending the reform
process. Cuts in excise duties were necessary. The fall in interest rates
follows a reduction in inflation. Who can deny the need in India for
spending on health, education and agricultural development if the fiscal
austerity of the past two years now provides some leeway? But it is hardly
coincidence that most of the measures are also vote-winners.
Provided that fiscal discipline is maintained and that a sudden surge in
imports does not wreck the balance of payments, it would be harsh to blame
Mr Singh for adopting a more populist approach. The government of Mr P V
Narasimha Rao needs to restore confidence in its direction and to boost
national morale after the violence which has followed the destruction of the
mosque at Ayodhya. Several important state elections are due and an early
general election cannot be ruled out.
The government's argument is that the past 20 months of cuts in the budget
deficit, subsidies, inflation and the balance of payments deficit, coupled
with the end of many bureaucratic hurdles in the way of investment, have
provided a base from which to accelerate economic growth. Without increases
in spending and cuts in duties, the budget deficit would be even smaller
than the 4 per cent of GDP desired by the International Monetary Fund.
This may be true. In the longer term, however, India's prosperity will
depend on the government tackling the most sensitive issues: tax reform,
subsidised lending, and the size of the public sector and of government
itself. Mr Singh has skirted round the edges of these except in one
important regard: his decision to inject capital into state-owned banks so
that they can clean from balance sheets un-provisioned bad debts, tighten
their management and prepare themselves to sell equity to the public.
The problem of dismantling India's complex web of controls is that each step
immediately provokes calls for the next. But this budget should not be
judged severely. It is a substantial move forward, with important incentives
for exports and for investors - in particular, the large cut in duties on
imports of capital goods and tax incentives for investment in infrastructure
projects, especially power generation. Faster economic growth will give the
government greater popular support to push reforms further. Then the most
difficult issues will have to be addressed.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Just what the doctor ordered: The merits of managed markets
in the provision of healthcare services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As Mrs Hillary Clinton examines strategies for reforming the US's costly and
incomplete healthcare system, she could learn much from the experience of
European countries in reforming their health services.
A recent Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report* on
healthcare reforms in seven European countries (see table) concludes that,
despite starting with very different health systems, they are converging on
the same solution to the problem of escalating costs.
That solution is what the OECD calls a 'managed market' in healthcare. The
details vary from country to country but, in each case, some sort of market
mechanism is created, in which doctors and hospitals compete to provide
health services paid for or underwritten by the government.
Some countries are further down the road towards managed markets than others
 -Germany, the Netherlands and the UK are the most advanced. And none of
them has all the elements of the model in place, with many still
experimenting with or in the middle of implementing their reforms.
However, all the important components of the model have been successfully
tested in one or other of the seven countries, allowing the OECD to describe
the managed market approach as 'not a high-risk strategy'.
All the countries provide healthcare universally or almost universally -
those with limited public provision have widened its scope in the past
decade. Methods of funding vary, however, with some paying for it out of
taxation, others through compulsory insurance contributions paid either to
private insurers, public bodies or a mixture of both.
All had experienced 'unacceptably high' growth rates in healthcare costs in
the 1970s, according to the OECD, with the share of GDP swallowed by health
rising during the decade by between 29 per cent in the UK and 71 per cent in
Ireland. The desire of politicians to contain these costs was the main
motive behind healthcare reforms.
Universal funding has proved to be the key to containing costs, says the
OECD. By setting overall budgets, governments can take the lead in
controlling expenditure by bearing down on producer interests such as
surgeons, hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry. Where health costs are
demand-led and open-ended - as in privately insured systems - there is no
such force for economy and efficiency.
Universal cover is also the key to improving the standard of health since it
allows basic medical care to be allocated according to need rather than
ability to pay. Without universal cover, insurers select healthier groups,
leaving the less healthy people - often on low incomes or ageing - with
little or no protection.
An additional argument in favour of universal funding is that it can help
reduce the financial burden on middle-income groups. With voluntary insured
systems such as in the US, they pay twice: their own insurance premiums, and
higher taxes to pay for public health services for the low-income groups who
are not covered by insurance.
But capping the budget is only the first step. The seven countries have all
experimented with market-type mechanisms for spending the budget more
efficiently. The common elements of these mechanisms are:
Decentralised purchasing agencies to buy health services for customers in
the light of local needs. In the UK, these are the district health
authorities, which purchase health services on behalf of most people living
in their areas.
Competition among 'providers', such as doctors, hospitals and other
community health services. Payments systems have been restructured to reward
those that are more efficient, so that money follows the patient.
A mixture of private-sector and public-sector providers to inject market
forces. In the UK, the entrepreneurial spirit is provided by the National
Health Service trusts, which are independent and self-governing.
Self-regulation on quality assurance - leaving it to professionals and
purchasing agencies to regulate the market, rather than heavy-handed
interference from above.
Within the managed market, paying for health services through a contract for
services is more cost-effective than reimbursement of fees for each service.
In France, for example, where healthcare was mostly paid for by
reimbursement of fees during the 1980s, the share of GDP consumed by
healthcare rose from 7.6 per cent of GDP in 1980 to 8.8 per cent in 1990.
The share was static in Germany and the Netherlands, which used the contract
method throughout this period.
There is evidence that countries that pay doctors fees for services have
higher consultation rates, longer consultation times and higher prescribing
rates. When Ireland switched from fee-for-service to a fixed annual contract
for each patient on the doctor's register, doctors' consultation rates fell
by a fifth. Fixed payments per head remove the incentive to over-treat to
earn fees - a big problem in the US.
The good news for US reformers - where 'socialised medicine' has
traditionally been viewed with suspicion - is that none of the seven is
moving towards a centralised, command economy-type health service.
The best example of the latter is in the UK. Until the recent reforms, the
NHS was largely organised on what the OECD describes as a 'public integrated
system': hospital and community health services were paid for and provided
by a centralised, vertically integrated, monolithic organisation.
Now the British health service is held up by the OECD report as one of the
two most advanced in its reforms. In addition to introducing managed markets
for healthcare providers, the UK has begun to introduce competition in
purchasing of health services. It is doing this by giving some family
doctors, called fund-holders, direct control of the budgets for hospital
treatment of their patients.
While most patients are treated under block contracts negotiated by district
health authorities, fund-holders can shop around for the best deals for
their patients. The OECD says that this has improved the responsiveness of
hospital services, though it concedes that it remains to be seen whether the
benefits can be extended to all patients.
Similar attempts to introduce competition in purchasing are being
implemented in the Netherlands, which will allow consumers to choose between
competing insurers and sickness funds. Membership of a scheme is to be
compulsory, and requires a flat-rate premium which is expected to cover 15
per cent of health costs.
The balance of health finance comes from a central healthcare fund which
collects income-related premiums from every consumer. This money is
distributed to purchasers according to the profile of their customers, so
that healthcare is allocated according to need. Selection and cream-skimming
are avoided by a requirement on schemes to accept all applicants.
The OECD accepts it is too early to make a final assessment of either the UK
or Dutch reforms. But the creation of managed markets in healthcare in each
of the seven European countries appears to have extended healthcare to most
or all the population at costs much lower than those in the US.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: Risks no reason to delay aid to Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From SILVIA MISKULIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I am sick and tired of comments that everything to do with helping
Croatia and Bosnia 'entails some very real political and military risk',
according to Mr Robert Mauthner's article 'Air-drops to land in a political
minefield' (February 25).
I am maybe naive, but has anyone ever joined in any war without 'some very
real political and military risk'? Are the soldiers being trained to be
afraid of risk, afraid of fighting, being shot at and shooting? The reason
why people don't join the army is because it is a risky occupation, which is
also one of the reasons why they do.
So far the British have done their best to postpone any kind of real help to
stop victimisation of Croats and Bosnians because of the risks involved.
Fair enough.
Therefore it is true that the Moslems' last hope were the Americans; so why
don't the British, if they themselves are afraid to help, allow someone else
to do it? They now say the American air-drop would stop the preace process.
What peace process? Within recent days the Serbs have destroyed another part
of Sarajevo. The Serbs have never yet stopped aggression for any peace
negotiations (ie going back to Lord Carrington's endless famous cease-fires
in Croatia).
So how can US air-drops start something that has never stopped? War cannot
escalate any further against Croats and Moslems. It could prove troublesome
to the Serbs and Serbs don't like to be troubled, as they keep warning the
west.
It seems to me that, in order not to annoy the Serbs, we condemn them on the
one hand and let them get away with murder on the other, and why shouldn't
Serbia vote for a war criminal to be their leader? After all, crime does
pay, as their leader Milosevic has proved and the west has allowed for far
too long.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From JOHAN ENEGREN

<TEXT>
Sir, It is comforting to read that Philip Stephens ('Premier makes music in
a minor', February 26) believes that Mr Major suppressed his doubts about
the US air-drop operation in Bosnia by calling it 'brave' and 'imaginative'.
However, if Stephens had read his Yes, Prime Minister, he would know that
such words can imply damning praise indeed, to be translated into
'foolhardy' or 'idiotic' or even worse. One can only hope that Mr Major's
vernacular has not been too contaminated by Appleby-ese. Of course, the
cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler, seems a far cry from Sir Humphrey, so
maybe the risk is not too great.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: A voting system that leads to capricious election
results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GARY TITLEY MEP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Edward Mortimer's defence of the single transferable vote (Foreign
Affairs, February 24) was ironically given the headline 'Vote to break the
bosses'. Ironically because, in fact, one of the effects of the STV is
actually to strengthen political 'bosses'.
STV encourages the development of a client system in which individual
politicians nurture their electorate, often in direct competition with
politicians in their own party and often in ways which more closely
represent 'pork-barrel' politics than we would believe could be acceptable.
STV is also extremely complex. As the Irish general election showed, it can
often take weeks for the final result to be known. Further, as the Plant
Report showed, STV is 'capricious' with the elimination process, throwing up
results which are clearly not the ones intended by the electorate.
STV therefore does not have a clear link between voters' intentions and
final outcome - which ought to be the prerequisite of any electoral system.
In short, STV is neither proportional, nor simple, nor conducive to party
discipline or to effective constituency representation. It is difficult, in
fact, to find a good reason even to consider it.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: The route round the late-payment cycle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN SUMNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We are constantly hearing about how the late payment of debts is,
supposedly, causing the downfall of many a business, and I dare say this is
a factor in the appalling company-failure statistics.
Nevertheless, the reality is that most trading companies selling on credit
to other businesses should never go down because of late payment of debt.
The reason is the existence in the financial markets of invoice discounting
and factoring products. By advancing to the company up to 80 per cent of
invoice value (including VAT) as soon as it is raised - the balance
reverting after collection - the greater part of the debt is properly funded
at the outset, enabling working capital to be replenished and the business
cycle to continue.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Letter: Government must play part in boosting industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK H J RADCLIFFE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, We shall do nothing for Britain's vital export trade if we continue to
talk in terms of problems rather than solutions in the manner of your
articles 'Industry's unstoppable slide' (February 19) and 'Charting the
mechanics of decline' (February 22).
No one disputes that the UK has an unacceptable trade deficit. Britain needs
to capture an extra 1 per cent of world trade in manufactured goods and
increase exports by at least Pounds 12bn a year to balance the books. But to
suggest, as you do, that the prime minister may be disappointed in looking
to industry for an export-led recovery is rather like shrugging your
shoulders and saying nothing can be done. A more positive approach is
needed.
The CBI's National Manufacturing Council is carrying out an examination of
those sectors of industry which have a trade imbalance, especially those in
which the deficit is increasing, with a view to finding ways of reversing
the trend. In addition, we are studying 11,000 categories of imports to
establish why such products are bought in from overseas rather than being
produced in the UK.
The CBI is also seeking improvements in the UK's inadequate education system
and weak transport infrastructure, to overcome their adverse effects on our
industrial performance.
Improved international competitiveness is the only real solution to
capturing a greater share of world markets, recognising, as we must, that 96
per cent of market potential is outside the UK. One solution to Britain's
inadequate performance is to raise the standards of many average UK
companies to world-class levels.
The NMC is seeking to do this by spreading best practice, and attracting the
best people into industry to make this happen. World-class performance
depends on world-class talent.
However, the government also has a role to play and we will be looking to
the forthcoming Budget for evidence that the government recognises the need
to encourage investment and exports to provide the basis for a sustained
recovery.

FT  01 MAR 93 / A rich new seam: The UK's latest source of energy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Natural gas trapped in coal seams could give Britain a vast new source of
usable energy. Geologists say UK reserves of coalbed methane, as the gas is
called, may exceed 1,000bn cubic metres - comparable with the total volume
in conventional North Sea gas fields.
The oil industry is starting to drill wells to extract the methane, which Mr
Tim Eggar, the energy minister, believes 'could represent a very valuable
addition to our future energy supplies'. Yet it has hardly been mentioned in
the debate currently raging about coal and gas in the UK.
'There seems to be a conspiracy of silence,' says one operator. 'No one
wants to talk about a new huge source of gas at a time when many people
think we already have more than we need.'
Several technical, fiscal and regulatory obstacles will have to be overcome
before Britain can exploit coalbed methane on the same scale as the US,
where gas is now flowing at a rate of 30m cu m a day. But it could offer a
vital supplement to UK gas supplies early in the next century, when the main
offshore reserves are likely to have been used up.
The Department of Trade and Industry awarded the first eight exploration
licences for coalbed methane in 1991; 27 more followed last year. They cover
coalfields in England, Wales and Scotland.
UK exploration for methane is led by companies with US experience. Evergreen
Resources, based in Colorado, is now testing the first well, Sealand-1 just
west of Chester in north-west England, and is drilling a second well south
of Rhyl on the north Wales coast.
'We believe Sealand is capable of production but we are still evaluating its
commercial possibilities,' says Mr Ian Thompson, Evergreen's UK managing
director.
A dozen other companies are involved in UK coalbed methane exploration. They
include Eastern Electricity, Kirkland Resources, Hillfarm Coal, Puffin Oil,
Babcock Energy, Powergen and Conoco. All are drilling well away from
collieries which could interfere with gas production.
Any well is bound to find some methane because all coal seams contain the
gas, adsorbed chemically on the surface of coal particles and filling the
tiny spaces between them. The question is whether it can be extracted in
commercial quantities.
The methane is traditionally regarded as a safety hazard in coalmines. It
has to be drained from the seams to prevent explosive quantities building up
underground. Although small amounts of gas are sometimes used locally, for
example to fire colliery boilers, it is normally vented into the atmosphere
 -a waste of energy similar to the flaring of natural gas in an oilfield.
From the environmental point of view it is better to extract methane for use
as a fuel, because it is a powerful 'greenhouse gas'. Each molecule
contributes 50 times more to global warming than a molecule of carbon
dioxide.
Commercial exploitation of coalbed methane started in the US during the
1970s, stimulated by new federal tax credits for unconventional gas
production. Six thousand wells have been drilled in three main areas in
Colorado/New Mexico, Alabama and Pennsylvania.
The technology developed for extracting methane depends first on creating
long fractures in the coal seam to enable the gas to flow more easily. The
simplest technique, hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water at high
pressure. Then the pressure is reduced at the surface - for example, by
pumping water out of the well - to stimulate the flow of gas.
Mr Eric Allen, an engineer with LAS Energy, a Canadian methane company, says
the technology has improved significantly over the past 10 years. 'With
recent advances in completion techniques, many new wells produce at levels
which are spectacular by any conventional comparison.'
Gas does not flow through coal seams as readily as through conventional
sandstone reservoirs, so coalbed extraction generally requires more wells
for a given area. But methane enthusiasts say the latest wellhead equipment
does not make an obtrusive impact on the landscape.
'Drilling costs are higher in the UK than in the US but all other factors
appear to compare favourably with the most productive areas in the US,' says
Mr John Garratt, managing director of Puffin Oil, an independent energy
company with methane interests in both countries. One attraction of the UK
market is that gas prices 'are among the highest in the world'.
But Mr Henry Boyd, secretary of the UK Onshore Operators Group, says:
'Coalbed methane will not be a bonanza for anyone. The returns will at best
be moderate.'
Mr Boyd points out that the outlook for coalbed methane in the UK is
overshadowed by uncertainties about the fiscal and regulatory regimes. These
are spelt out in a memorandum on coalbed methane prepared by Oil Management
Services (OMS), a London consultancy which provides the group's
administration.
The main fiscal uncertainty concerns the point at which petroleum revenue
tax would apply to a coalbed methane field. OMS says the reaction of some US
companies is: 'Let us know when the UK works out its tax regime; meanwhile
we will go to third-world countries which do know what their tax regime is.'
A more fundamental legal question is: who owns coalbed methane? British Coal
maintains that its property includes not only all coal in the UK but also
the gas trapped within it. The onshore operators, on the other hand, insist
that the methane belongs to the crown, although most agree that British
Coal's permission is required to drill into its seams.
'Licensees have been outraged at the claims being made by British Coal,'
says OMS. 'They did not expect to be required to make substantial additional
payments to British Coal as a condition for exercising their petroleum
licences.'
The operators are lobbying the DTI hard to resolve the uncertainties and
encourage methane production. The incentive is not only to provide a new
indigenous energy source for the next century; it is also to lay the
foundations for a UK industry which could export services and equipment to
other European countries seeking to exploit their coalbed methane resources,
just as the North Sea fields provided the basis for Britain's offshore oil
and gas industry.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: Snow Orchid - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is it because of the greater influence of psychoanalysis there that the
United States in this century has developed so much stronger a tradition of
serious drama set in the family home than we have ever had in Britain?
Joseph Pintauro's Snow Orchid presents an Italian-American family nucleus of
mother, father, and two sons, and illumines the traumatic psychological
damage effected by spouses/parents upon each other and their children. Every
scene but the last occurs inside the family's tight little apartment. The
only intruder is the elder son's boyfriend; and he doesn't stay long.
Though Snow Orchid is sometimes funny and does not actually ring true at
every moment, you can't miss how it addresses family matters in a
psychologically serious way that our theatre has avoided. At the Gate, where
it is having its British premiere performances, its intensity has terrific
force. Rob Howell's designs turn the tiny space into the apartment's several
rooms with wonderful detail; Tim Luscombe's direction has produced a kind of
Italian-American detailed conviction of playing rare in our theatre.
Snow Orchid is in no way radical today - it was probably not radical when
written in 1979 - but over here it is still a shot in the arm, simply
because of the nature of its realism. The painful recriminations between
husband and wife, between father and elder son, between mother and younger
son, and the wealth of detail that each such scene drags up: all is
marvellously persuasive, even cathartic.
The play's final scene is the wrong kind of catharsis - a touch of optimism
that arrives too neatly, though staged at the Gate with a surprise scene
change that is something of a coup de theatre. Details are thrown away too
lightly, such as the father's admission that he not only never loved his
wife, he never loved anyone - puzzling, since he demonstrates love for both
sons. And, though it is presented here by the London Gay Theatre Company,
its handling of gayness and gay issues is not its most central concern or
successful achievement. Snow Orchid is ultimately about the claustrophobia
of family life.
The linchpin of the Gate staging is Paola Dionisotti as Filumena. Her
Italian accent is flawless, even in its incipient Americanisms; and the
aggressive fury that has always made her remarkable is given a fresh spark
by enacting a Mediterranean temperament. Here, as in Vassa Zheleznova (same
theatre, 1990), she is playing a minor latterday Clytemnestra; how about
reviving Mourning becomes Electra for her?
As her husband and two sons, Roger Lloyd Pack, Adam Magnani and Jude Law are
excellent. The playing sags only twice; first, after the climax of Sebbie's
tremendous bathroom scene with his father; second, in Blaise's too mild
reproaches to his mother. These are brief lapses in a performance that holds
its audience gripped from first to last.
Gate Theatre, London W11, until March 27 (071 229 0706)

FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: Mark Murphy and Eurodance - Dance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you knew the new-dance scene but not who choreographed Mark Murphy's
Headshot, you might well assume that it had been made across the Channel.
But if you didn't know the new-dance scene, you wouldn't think that Headshot
was a dance anyway.
The dancers of Mark Murphy's V-Tol Company, performing the 70-minute
Headshot at the Place, London, last weekend, are attractive and fit, but
dancing is hardly what he asks them to do. Though his choreography is
authoritative, it is much too important to have mere dance on its mind. Why
should it concern itself with petty things like showing you how these
dancers respond to music; or what kinds of rhythm and phrasing they can
develop; or the degree of virtuoso articulation of which they are capable?
All that has been out of date for years.
In this respect, Murphy is like scores of choreographers on the new-dance
scene. The two things that make Headshot unusual are first, that in one or
two moments he reveals an instinct to make these dancers (of whom he is one)
really move commandingly across the stage, turning and/or jumping; and
second, that otherwise it has been very smartly organised as a perfect
example of Eurodance - ie non-dance physical theatre, full of aggression and
irony, with deliberately 'controversial' flashes of sociology.
Men and women get hit, brutalised, and shot by one another. Every aspiration
to tenderness or romance is to no avail. As for the episodes of brutality,
when they are fitted to rock or jazz music, they actually start to look
droll, even hip. The mixture of elegance and violence is part of the work's
deliberate irony.
This sour world view - albeit despondent and cynical - has been expressed
with apparent conviction by a host of cross-Channel choreographers: notably
Pina Bausch. It has even produced a few works of art. But Headshot does not
appear sincere, or like an attempt to make art. It is a mere exercise in
audience manipulation, in slick modishness. Murphy has mastered every trick
 -even the cliched Kamikaze jump now widely known as the Eurocrash, in which
the dancer lands bang on the floor, rolls over, picks himself up, and dives
splat back on to the ground.
Yet I suspect that Murphy's dance instincts are more innocent and lively
than Headshot would have us believe. Though there is very little here that
should be dignified by the name of dance, that little has a sweep, an attack
and a pleasure in precisely controlled energy that are all welcome.
But so what? Does Murphy have the courage to follow his dance instincts when
the prevailing trends from the Continent blow so strongly in the opposite
direction?

FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: The Venetian Twins
</HEADLINE>

THE Venetian lawyer Carlo Goldoni (1707-1793) was told his face was too
jovial for the profession. Turning a jolly disposition to good account, he
found himself better fitted for writing commedia dell'arte than subpoenas,
and embarked on an extraordinary career in Venice and Paris which yielded
nearly 300 plays in Italian and French.
Now Goldoni's The Venetian Twins (1746) at the Oxford Playhouse (Oxford
Stage Company) opens his bicentenary. This is anarchic comedy looking back
to Rabelais, sideways at Marivaux and forward to Feydeau. Goldoni's subjects
are social, rarely political: 'The secret of the art of writing comedy,' he
wrote, 'is to cling to nature, and never leave her.' The quality of the
invention and insight is a reminder that Goldoni has been overlooked and
undervalued.
The plot beggars belief. Zanetto and Tonino are identical twins, one
simple-stupid and the other suave-clever. Unknown to the other, each arrives
in Verona. There, Zanetto is betrothed to local beauty Rosaura, a horror in
fluffy mules; meanwhile Tonino is awaited by his pudgy fiancee, Beatrice.
The ensuing confusion runs out of breath after two deaths, two marriages and
the appearance of the twins' long-lost sister.
The mistaken identities and cross-purposes are like The Comedy of Errors or
the last act of Twelfth Night. Robert David MacDonald's stiff translation is
laced with Shakespearean borrowings in true commedia dell'arte style.
Goldoni was one of the first commedia dell'arte playwrights to give written
parts to actors used to improvisation. The dialogue here keeps up a Whose
Line is it Anyway?  unpredictability: 'I managed to purloin a gondola and
make my way here' - 'By land?'  - 'My adventures would amaze you.'
The acting, especially from Peter Jordan as the twins and Clare Cathcart as
the winsome Beatrice, is robust and energetic. Jordan's best scenes are when
Tonino visits Rosaura and takes his brother's bride-to-be for a whore and
his future in-laws for pimps, and a wonderful scene where the two brothers
meet, offstage, in a public lavatory.
Other highlights include Polly Kemp as Rosaura's lubricous maid and Malcolm
Scates as Lelio, who wears an amoebic waistcoat and a fixed grin whilst
pursuing Beatrice. Juliet Hill's busy pastiche score keeps the action
flowing, while Mark Brickman's direction finds a measure of mess within the
ordered plot. The moral, from the lips of a dying Veronese: 'If we were
always good, we should not need to be wise.'

Earlier this month the government published a report by a Mr John Warne (an
assessor appointed by the Department of the Environment) that reviewed the
Architects' Registration Acts from 1931 to 1969.
This slim, blue and grey document, published by Her Majesty's Stationery
Office at Pounds 6.50, is not on the current bestseller lists - which is
hardly surprising because it deals with the pretty arcane subject of the
legal registration of the title 'architect'. But in some quarters it is seen
as a small bombshell that completely changes the nature of professionalism
for architects and has wide repercussions for education and practice.
The Warne Report's main recommendation is that The Architects' Registration
Acts should be repealed and the profession be deregulated. At the moment
architecture is a uniquely protected profession. It was a struggle to pass
the Architects' Registration Act in 1931, five bills having been previously
defeated by parliament, which felt that to hand the official registration
and control of the architectural profession to its own Royal Institute would
be too monopolistic.
The Act of 1931 created an independent council, the Architects Registration
Council of the United Kingdom, to regulate the membership, conduct and
education of the profession. You cannot legally call yourself an architect
unless you register with ARCUK. The case for this independent council was
declared to be 'the protection of the public from the half-trained, the
untrained and the absolute imposter'.
The government has accepted Mr Warne's report and when the repealing
legislation is passed in two years time, Britain's architects will no longer
be a protected species. Architectural services will be offered by builders,
designers and consultants, and self-regulation will be the order of the day
for the architects who will be able to call themselves 'chartered
architects', with institutions like the RIBA and its Scottish and Ulster
equivalents becoming the self-regulatory bodies.
Mr Warne is the former secretary of the Institute of Chartered Accountants
and his report suggests that architects should organise themselves very like
accountants. His main recommendations are that the title 'architect' should
no longer be protected by statute; that ARCUK and its Board of Architectural
Education should be abolished; and that the RIBA should be confirmed as a
self-regulatory body operating in the public interest.
Sir George Young, the minister at the Department of the Environment
responsible for any legislation, said on the report's publication: 'There is
no reason why architects, uniquely amongst the construction professions,
should be regulated by statute. The established arrangements for
self-regulation through the chartered professional institutions provide for
satisfactory protection of the public interest and of consumers.'
The Royal Institute of British Architects has pondered the report and
decided that the abolition of registration 'is a retrograde step, not in the
public interest'. This reaction is not surprising, but seems short-sighted
as the Warne Report also goes out of its way to suggest that a reformed and
improved RIBA has a key role to play in developing a 'client-friendly'
profession. Warne recommends that the RIBA should be invited to include lay
members on its committees and to examine ways in which users of
architectural services and the construction industry could help to develop
architectural education.
It is tragic that the RIBA has reacted in such a Pavlovian way. It has been
made a series of offers in the report that could set it up as the inclusive
body for the construction of buildings. The profession is very vulnerable:
there are too many architects in too many small firms chasing too few jobs.
The RIBA has for years wasted endless time and money on internal political
bickering (for which it is justly criticised in the report). Architects have
a bad name with the public, which does not see any benefit to them in the
statutory protection of a title. The RIBA is invited to have formal annual
discussions with government - something it has long wanted - about
priorities in design matters.
The excellent president of the RIBA, Richard MacCormac, is worried about the
arrival on the scene of 'cowboys' calling themselves architects. He should
understand that much of the profession has behaved little better than the
average cowboy to its clients - all under the umbrella of special statutory
protection. Architects are judged by results not by their nomenclature.
This freeing up of the profession offers important chances for the reform of
education and will encourage new schools. The Prince of Wales's Institute of
Architecture is already pioneering a more holistic approach to the design of
buildings and encouraging the demise of professional divisiveness among the
various professions and trades that design buildings. I hope the Prince's
institute will promote public discussion of the important questions raised
by this report about educational reforms, and make a bid for some of the
ARCUK education fund. I suspect that, while the RIBA continues to
contemplate its navel, others will step in and take advantage of the spirit
of free competition. Architects will have only themselves to blame if they
fail, yet again, to get their professional act together.
