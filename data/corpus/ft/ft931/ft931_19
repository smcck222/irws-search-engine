FT  01 MAR 93 / Arts: Iron hands in velvet gloves - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Companies can expect to have their arms twisted more gently and effectively
in future by the development officers of arts organisations whose task it is
to drum up sponsorship money. The arrival on the scene of full-time
development officers has transformed the sponsorship industry: on average,
development officers will have raised around Pounds 125,000 for their arts
groups last year.
Last month, WH Smith sponsored, with Business in the Arts, a residential
course for 16 development officers with the aim of improving their skills in
persuasion and negotiation. The presence of a successful revenue raiser in
an arts company takes a great burden off the shoulders of the chief
executive. Artistic directors and museum directors have spent too many hours
being nice to potential and existing sponsors. No wonder that good
development directors are regarded as worth their weight in gold.
The heavily over-subscribed course, which attracted executives from the
National Theatre, the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, the Aldeburgh
festival, and the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, will be repeated.
Mixing business and the arts at an even more senior level is also proving a
rewarding experience. In January five arts managers, including Stephen
Remington, chief executive of Sadler's Wells, and Bubble Lodge, chief
executive of the Everyman, Cheltenham, won bursaries which will send them to
institutions such as the Cranfield School of Management. English Estates
will put up about Pounds 10,000 towards their fees. So far, 23 arts
executives have already received intensive management training through the
bursary scheme.
In addition there is the Business in the Arts placement programme which
works the other way, seconding corporate managers with special skills - in
computing, accountancy, marketing - to advise local arts organisations. To
date there have been 250 such mind-expanding experiences.
IBM has always been a stalwart sponsor of the arts. In cash terms its
commitment is not amazing, about Pounds 400,000 a year, but it has been
supporting them for more than 20 years. For most of this time Peter
Wilkinson supervised the budget.
Last year, to cut costs, IBM shed all its marketing departments. A new
company, Comark, was established, mainly staffed by ex-IBM personnel, to
supply advertising, PR, and marketing services generally to IBM under a
five-year contract. Wilkinson's sponsorship department, which includes sport
and the community, is part of Comark, and twice a year now he makes
proposals to the thinned-down IBM management.
So far there has been little change to the arts programme. The budget, while
not increased, has not been cut, and the bias remains towards youth projects
and the creation of new events with a community appeal. Corporate
entertaining scarcely features.
You could hardly get more innovative than 'Da Capo - From the Beginning' at
the Royal Academy of Music, which IBM is sponsoring from March 8. It is a
five-day festival of works by 57 living composers all of whom studied at the
Royal Academy. Rodney Bennett, Maw and Tavener are composers in residence
and there will be pieces by Birtwistle, Berkeley, Dankworth and many, many,
more.
*****
Companies are very reluctant to sponsor big, elitist, arts events in the
current climate. More and more of the budget is being directed towards
community, environmental, or charity causes. This is true at Thorn-EMI which
has a corporate budget of about Pounds 750,000 for good works, including the
arts.
Last year it made a big promotional splash and invested Pounds 400,000 in
touring Europe with Beethoven's Broadwood piano. This year arts expenditure
is going towards such events as National Youth Theatre workshops in Feltham
Prison; a residency by London Contemporary Dance at the Brimble Hill Special
School; and Pounds 40,000, over three years, towards Music for Youth.
Tomorrow it is underwriting a charity evening for the new musical Crazy For
You which will benefit the Cancer and Leukaemia in Childhood Trust by Pounds
80,000. Even the guests of chairman Colin Southgate will be expected to pay
for their tickets.
*****
A major new award for the arts, worth Pounds 100,000, has been announced.
Each year the Vivien Duffield Foundation will present the Vivien Duffield
Award to a British performing arts company to allow it to mount a project
which would otherwise be beyond its means.
The first recipient is Welsh National Opera, which next winter will present
three operas based around the Cinderella myth. Nine other opera companies
were asked to suggest ideas. Theatre companies will be approached for the
1994 award, and in subsequent years dance and classical music will benefit.
*****
On the same theme the RSC is looking for a sponsor, or two, for the Prince
of Wales Shakespeare School. The Prince is keen that Shakespeare should be
taught in schools and he is putting his influence behind two 12-day courses
at the RSC's Other Place theatre in Stratford in the summer at which 70
teachers will be trained by RSC experts. The cost of the venture is Pounds
90,000, and the Prince will be putting in an appearance.
*****
British Telecom is enjoying itself as the UK's leading arts sponsor. It has
now upped its 1993 budget to Pounds 1.8m, way ahead of any competitor, and
is displaying its market leadership by getting into bed with the Association
for Business Sponsorship of the Arts, the industry pressure group. In future
it will help fund ABSA seminars, literature, and general proselytising work.
Last year's BT New Contemporaries art show is currently on display at the
ICA in London at the end of its tour and BT has committed itself to sponsor
the 1993-94 show, with about Pounds 65,000, starting in Manchester in June.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
New ideas about the state of the universe are discussed in Horizon (8.00
BBC2) which looks at the 100-inch telescope built 70 years ago by Edwin
Hubble in California, and also at the Hubble space telescope. Although the
only thing most of us know about the space telescope is that it has a defect
in its mirror, it has still been surveying distant parts of the universe and
showing that more galaxies existed when our solar system was young. ITV's
new drama, September Song, is about Billy and Ted (Michael Williams and
comedian Russ Abbot) who suddenly change their lives when, in their late
fifties, Billy loses his job as a barman and Ted loses his wife. They decamp
to Blackpool when Billy is offered a job as a compere in what turns out to
be a strip joint. Tonight's episode (8.00) lasts an hour. History will
surely conclude that, among all the social experiments tried in the later
part of the 20th century, closing the mental hospitals and pushing the
patients out to sink or swim was the most iniquitous. Panorama looks at a
mother who killed her children a month after leaving a mental hospital (9.30
BBC1).

Daks Simpson, the clothing manufacturer and retailer, has made two new
appointments to its board as part of the continued reorganisation since its
takeover by Japan's Sankyo Seiko in 1991.
Colin Campbell, who joined Daks in 1975 and became group company secretary
in 1976, has become a group director with responsibility for legal,
administrative and personnel matters. Don Ruffle, who joined Simpsons of
Piccadilly in 1961 as a buyer and was latterly marketing director of the
group's Invertere casual and rainwear division, has become group
merchandising director and a board member.
Daks says the appointments reflect the desire to have all important group
functions represented at board level.
Wim Van Overdijk, an outside director since 1989 who advised Daks on design
and technical matters, has resigned to pursue his other design and
manufacturing interests, including his company Design House in the
Netherlands.

FT  01 MAR 93 / People: Erskine gets on the mobile
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mars was marvellous for Peter Erskine but the call of the portable phone
proved compelling and he has just been appointed director of BT's Mobile
Communications division.
Erskine, 41, describes it as an opportunity to take a leading role in one of
the few markets which are booming at the present time. The division,
700-people strong, deals with BT's cellular telephones and radio pagers,
serving more than 600,000 customers.
A marketeer by training and inclination, Erskine clearly relishes the
prospect of competing against Vodafone and a host of new entrants to what is
one of the fastest moving high technology markets. 'My job is to make sure
we take a leading share of this market,' he says. The portable phone
business will be revolutionised over the next few years as personal
communicators using digital transmission replace today's mobile telephones.
Erskine went to Liverpool University where he read psychology before
learning the essentials of sales and marketing with Colgate Palmolive. He
then worked for companies in the Mars group, ending up as vice-president for
Mars Electronics International. A brief interlude with Unitel, now part of
Mercury, kindled his enthusiasm for mobile phones: 'The challenge is using
consumer marketing techniques in a area where they have not been used
extensively before,' he says.

FT  01 MAR 93 / People: Anderson. Bank of England to Bank of Egypt
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the perks of working for The Bank of England is that its former
executives tend to get snapped up by foreign banks keen to make the right
impression on the authorities. In the 1970s, before foreign exchange
controls were abolished, there was a heavy trade in retired Bank of England
officials who knew their way around the forex markets. Nowadays, former
members of the Bank's supervisory staff seem most in demand.
The latest ex-Bank of England official to resurface in the Square Mile is
John Anderson, 56, a former deputy head of banking supervision. He has
joined the board of the newly formed National Bank of Egypt International
and has been given the job of chairing its audit committee whose job is to
make sure that the bank's executives don't go off the rails.
The National Bank of Egypt is the biggest of Egypt's state-owned banks and
has operated in London for more than a decade. However, it has set up
National Bank of Egypt International to take advantage of the European
Commission's second banking directive which allows UK-authorised banks to do

FT  01 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Pounds 37m motorway improvement
scheme
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Secretary of State for Transport has awarded BALFOUR BEATTY CIVIL
ENGINEERING the contract for the widening of the M6 motorway improvements
between junctions 30-32, in Lancashire, valued at Pounds 37.5m.
The works comprise the widening of the dual three-lane M6 motorway, between
junction 30, which is the interchange between the M6 and the M61 at Blacow
and junction 32 at the interchange between the M6 and the M55 at Broughton,
to dual four-lane motorway standard.
The work will be achieved by a combination of asymmetrical and parallel
widening with a short section of off-lane replacement.
Extensive environmental features include earth mounding and noise
attenuation measures.
Junctions 30 and 31 will be remodelled. Junction 31 is the junction of the
M6 with the A59 and will include the realignment of the trunk road and
roundabouts together with two new slip road bridges over the River Ribble.
A new underbridge, together with provision for new south facing slip road
stubs associated with a possible future junction 31A, are to be constructed.
In addition, 15 bridges will be either demolished, demolished and
reconstructed, widened and redecked or refurbished and extended. Hard
shoulders, which have discontinuities at all bridges, will be made
continuous throughout.
Scheduled for completion in December 1994, the project also involves new
lighting and motorway signalling erected on gantries.
The consulting engineer for the development is Rendel, Palmer and Tritton.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Construction Contracts: Waterloo Station project
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BOVIS CONSTRUCTION has begun work on a Pounds 20.85m design manage construct
contract to refurbish a four-storey office building for British Rail at
Waterloo Station.
With the offices situated above the main entrance to one of London's busiest
stations, the P&amp;0 company's project team faces the task of stripping out the
interior and refurbishing the building through very restricted access,
alongside a pedestrianised station concourse and a taxi cab access road.
A continuous planning dialogue between British Rail and Bovis will ensure
that minimal disruption is caused to the 250,000 commuters who pass beneath
the building every day.
The Bovis team has just 16 months to create three office suites, each
providing about 60,000 sq ft of lettable office space. Whilst the majority
of the floor area will be of an open plan design, at least 10 per cent will
be cellularised.
As well as the structural alterations and additions, Bovis will be managing
the fitting out for British Rail tenants.
These include British Transport Police, for whom a new police station is
being created, and European Passenger Services, a subsidiary of British
Rail.
Internally, each building will feature raised floors, suspended ceilings,
carpets and partitions. New services, including power, heat and air
conditioning, will be installed within ceiling voids.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Economics: Focus turns to Germany and worries about interest
rates and prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RUSH of figures in Germany will turn attention this week to the state of
Europe's biggest economy. Analysts are expecting the indicators - including
industrial production, manufacturing new orders, and employment data - to
confirm that the economy is 'going nowhere'.
Ms Alison Cottrell, international economist at Greenwell Montagu, suggests
that 'a barely changed level of industrial output in January on the month
may look better than December, but it ranks poorly in comparison to rises of
5.1 per cent in January 1992 and 2.7 per cent in 1991'.
Prospects for monetary easing after the Bundesbank's regular council meeting
on Thursday will add to the interest in Germany although the market is
divided over whether the central bank will cut officially posted rates.
Labour figures on Friday are forecast to show a fall in west German
employment of around 20,000 reflecting the decline in manufacturing
industry.
The following are some of the week's other economic highlights. The figures
in brackets are the median of analysts' forecasts from MMS International, a
financial information company.

FT  01 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAMS HOLDINGS, the industrial conglomerate, is expected to have suffered
a 5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 168m to Pounds 160m, when
it announces its full-year results on Thursday.
The company's exposure to DIY and aerospace markets are behind the likely
slip in earnings per share to 20.1p (22.8p). The dividend is expected to be
maintained.
Another round of write-downs on property and the Channel Tunnel contract is
thought to have kept BICC's pre-tax profit flat at about Pounds 80m last
year. It reports on Wednesday.
This time the cables and construction group is expected to provide for its
Spitalfields joint venture among roughly Pounds 40m of charges. Although
this will again leave the 19.25p total dividend uncovered, BICC said it
would maintain it when it made a Pounds 154m rights issue last year. The
proceeds went towards buying continental and US cables businesses and helped
to reduce debt.
Two more composite insurance companies, General Accident and Guardian Royal
Exchange, are expected to report sharply reduced losses this week.
Rising premium rates and milder weather are mainly responsible for the
improvement at both companies, neither of which are heavily exposed to
losses from domestic mortgage indemnity business. General Accident is
expected to report a loss of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m tomorrow,
compared with a deficit of Pounds 171.6m in 1991. On Wednesday, Guardian
Royal Exchange could also report losses of between Pounds 20m and Pounds
40m, against losses of Pounds 209.7m in 1991.
Fisons, the drugs and scientific instrument group, reports its full-year
results tomorrow. Analysts are unsure about the net impact of disposals
during the last 12 months, which must now be carried above the line to
conform to the new FRS3 accounting standard.
Lehman Brothers estimates the underlying business will report profits down
from Pounds 190.5m last year to about Pounds 105m. This represents a 50 per
cent improvement during the second half of the year. Followers will be
watching for a statement about future prospects more than the historic
results.
The 1992 results for Barclays will be announced on Thursday. These will be
preceded tomorrow by Abbey National, and on Wednesday by Midland.
Barclays is expected to make a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 100m, and a
retained loss of Pounds 500m-Pounds 600m after maintaining the final
dividend. However, BZW is predicting a cut in the dividend.
Abbey National will make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 570m, and retained
profits of about Pounds 200m. Its provisions for possible bad debts are
expected to double to about Pounds 320m, reflecting the depressed UK housing
market.
Midland is expected to show the effect of a significant lightening of its
provisions for possible bad debts to about Pounds 700m for the year compared
to Pounds 903m in 1991. This is expected to boost pre-tax profits to about
Pounds 200m from Pounds 36m.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Management: When employees rate their superior - Appraising
your boss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FURNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
More and more organisations subscribe to the fundamental ideas of
performance management. All employees should be given regular feedback on
their job performance. And these ratings are often tied - in some loose way
 -to promotions, merit pay, sideways moves, or are used more simply for
training purposes. Some organisations determine pay increments by these
ratings so that salary is not decided by collective bargaining but rather by
rated, individual effort. Performance management means true meritocracy.
For performance management to work, appraisals need to be seen to be
accurate, fair, sensitive and reliable. For most corporations, employees are
rated by their bosses on criteria such as time-keeping and contribution to
innovation. In effect this means once or twice a year a manager must fill
out a rating form on his or her employees. Some managers may have to
appraise many subordinates, which leads to certain problems - do the
managers know all their staff? How much time does it take to appraise so
many? What about problems of favouritism?
Innovative organisations have found a simple, radical solution to these
problems. In the UK, BP, British Airways and Central Television among others
are changing their methods. Employees are not rated by their superiors but
by their subordinates. Not top-down but bottom-up. Simple and democratic
though it is, the idea puts the fear of God into many managers.
What can be gained from this method? The following points have arisen from
work in Cathay Pacific Airlines.
Subordinates tend to know their superior better than superiors know their
subordinates. They see their bosses and know their moods, foibles and
preferences, their adequacies, skills, strengths and limitations and things
they do and do not like doing.
As all subordinates rate their managers statistically, these ratings tend to
be more reliable - the more subordinates the better. Instead of the biases
of individual managers' ratings, the various ratings of the employees can be
converted into a representative view. If the employees have very differing
views of their bosses this can present problems, but represents very
significant data meriting further investigation.
Subordinates' ratings have more impact because it is more unusual to receive
ratings from subordinates. It is also surprising to bosses because, despite
protestations to the contrary, information often flows down organisations
more smoothly and comfortably than it flows up. When it flows up it is
qualitatively and quantitatively different. It is this difference that makes
it valuable.
What are the dangers of converting the appraisal system to a bottom-up
approach?
Some employees might hesitate to give a frank and fair appraisal of their
boss for fear of reprisal. On the other hand, employees may be unused to
giving either negative or positive feedback. This can be observed by a 'halo
effect' where bland, safe-ratings, half-way up the scale are given. However,
an anonymous rating might lead some employees to be vindictive, for example
to a boss who is pushing staff to do better. Such a rating would easily be
detected however, because it would differ significantly from other ratings.
There are also greater costs involved. More forms have to be processed,
probably by computer programme, than in the top-down method. But there are
now companies such as Pilat of Israel, or Forum (Europe), a US company,
which have written the software for this type of analysis. Subordinates also
need training on how to rate individuals without falling into some of the
well-known traps. Training courses, paperwork and computing software cost
money.
Do the benefits, costs and risks outweigh the dangers and disadvantages of
the bottom-up system? The fact that such innovative companies have persisted
with these methods indicates they believe it has benefits.
To some extent initial enthusiasm has been tempered, as in the case of BA,
but it is recognised that working well, the bottom-up system is efficient
and equitable. To put in place the performance management system an
organisation needs to trust staff to be honest, fair and constructive. It
also needs to pay more than lip service to the idea that communication is a
two-way process. More importantly it needs to be willing to act on the
ratings of subordinates. This takes some courage and for multinationals,
real culture change.
The bottom-up approach is the first step in the process of taking staff
opinions seriously and allowing staff to influence the organisation. The
management toast for the successful go-ahead service-related business is a
good one, not 'down the hatch' but 'bottoms up'.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Management: Support for Aids project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Picture the scene: a jack collapses in a repair workshop, a mechanic is
trapped under a car and there is blood everywhere. The mechanic is known to
be gay. No-one wants to touch him in case he has got it - Aids. The
first-aid kit cannot be found and the victim screams for help while his
workmates freeze in horror and indecision.
This chilling sequence of events - played by actors in this instance, but
only too plausible - comes from a training video from the Terrence Higgins
Trust, in partnership with a group of blue-chip employers. Companies which
have given their backing to the training project include IBM, Marks and
Spencer, Unilever, Kingfisher and WH Smith.
The project has also published a training manual and briefing notes,
covering basic medical information, recruitment issues, confidentiality,
pensions, first aid and travel abroad.
Separately, the Society of Occupational Medicine has also produced a booklet
which covers some of the same ground and serves as a good introduction to
the subject.
European companies have been slower than their US counterparts to draw up
policies covering HIV and Aids and educate their workforces. A degree of
complacency, even, has crept in. This latest batch of training material will
help to reawaken interest in the issue.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Management: Streamlined for speed - A report on General
Accident's 'inside-out' transformation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It's 16.32 on a Friday afternoon. The electronic indicator board high on the
wall of General Accident's new Glasgow offices shows that 1,365 calls have
been handled by the claims staff of the country's second-biggest insurance
company. Five staff are on the phone dealing with customers' inquiries.
No calls are waiting to be answered, a pleasing statistic for Alistair
Waters, at 32, one of a new generation of insurance managers at the UK's
second-biggest insurance company. He says that 98 per cent of calls are
handled within three seconds and most claims are handled within two days.
It is a far cry from the recent past when it could take General Accident
weeks to respond to its policyholders. But, in common with other insurers,
GA is changing its ways, overhauling its traditional bureaucratic
organisation in order to transform relationships with its customers.
Stung by losses of more than Pounds 2bn in 1990 and 1991 and spurred by new
competitors who have been quick to take advantage of new technologies, the
UK's biggest insurers have slashed jobs, reducing numbers by up to a third
in some cases.
But there is more to the industry's reorganisation than a simple reduction
in headcount. In many companies whole layers of middle management have been
removed, while new responsibilities are being given to lower-grade staff.
Status-conscious hierarchies are giving way to flatter, more responsive and
more goal-oriented businesses.
The changes are all the more striking at General Accident because the
company has long been one of the industry's most conservative, dominated by
generations of Scottish actuaries. Yet two years of losses have underlined
the need for change, which has quickened since the departure of Buchan
Marshall, the former chief general manager, who retired at the end of 1989.
One of the main aims of the reorganisation - orchestrated by the head of UK
operations, Bob Scott - has been to improve the speed with which claims are
paid, as well as the quality of back-up services and complaints procedures.
Such changes have had an important influence on the organisation's culture,
with the company shifting from what Scott calls an 'administrative-centred'
approach to one based on 'long-term customer service', heavily influenced by
the experience of companies such as Toyota. GA has been turned 'inside out',
says Ray Andrews, a former Saatchi and Saatchi executive, recruited in 1990
to head an overhaul of GA's internal communications.
Scott explains how management and organisational changes have paved the way
for much more rapid handling of claims. The goal is to respond to all
claimants within five days, says Scott. Five years ago 'a claim would have
been processed by the clerk, sent to the under manager, then the manager to
be checked and finally back to the clerk. The whole process could take
weeks,' says Scott. 'You could justify the old system on the grounds that it
guaranteed accuracy. But it destroyed people's initiative.'
Under the new system GA's lower-grade claims staff have been given more
responsibility to carry out basic tasks. 'They have to get it right. They
are responsible,' says Scott.
Computers have helped. Over the past three years, GA has abolished its
typing pool and has weaned staff away from the use of paper files. Staff at
GA's 'new model' office in Dundee - where the new systems were first
introduced - make extensive use of computer training techniques, as part of
a programme which equips them to handle all aspects of insurance
transactions - underwriting, claims and accounts, and the like - instead of
the much narrower focus of the past.
While lower-grade staff are being asked to be more responsible, managers are
under pressure to take a more active interest in the development of the
company's business.
For a start there are fewer of them. Scott has pushed through a radical
overhaul of GA's branch structure, replacing over two thirds of the
company's 60 or so branch managers. A middle management position,
responsible purely for office administration, has been scrapped.
Relieved of many of their control and checking functions, managers are being
encouraged to develop areas of new business. John Munro and his management
team in Dundee, for example, are examining ways of persuading motor
policyholders to take out home or creditor insurance.
'There is much more emphasis on accountability,' says Munro, who runs the
group's Dundee office. 'We have much more headroom and much more room to
take initiatives.' There are now six management layers, against eight
previously, improving the company's responsiveness and increasing the
opportunities for younger managers such as Waters and Munro to rise within
the organisation, where promotion is no longer tied to seniority and time
serving.
Performance-related pay is becoming common and information about the company
more widely disseminated. In the past, middle management has seen its
control over information as a source of power, says Scott. By contrast GA
senior management now report details of the company's performance.
All this is good news for younger managers such as Waters, who began working
with GA 13 years ago at the group's offices in Ayr and began building up
GA's direct motor subsidiary at the age of 29, a position of prominence
unimaginable for a young manager even 10 years ago.
'Everyone is on first-name terms,' says Waters. 'We are trying to develop an
operation that downplays concern for status. It's much more open - more
frank and more goal-orientated than in the past. All the layers have been
taken away. All the bullshit has gone.'

FT  01 MAR 93 / Move on council-house mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is to press building societies to be more willing to provide
mortgages on homes that have been bought by former council tenants.
Ministers will be holding meetings with the Council of Mortgage Lenders in
the run-up to a new campaign which will encourage council tenants to
exercise their right to buy their homes. The lenders will be urged to end
their reluctance to provide mortgages for some former council properties,
particularly flats.
Some Conservative councillors say that the building societies' attitude can
lead to former tenants who have bought their homes being unable to move
because prospective purchasers cannot get mortgages.
When complaints were first raised on this matter last summer the council
assured ministers that if a building society had once provided a mortgage on
a property then it would continue to be ready to provide one in future.
This has run into difficulties however, because of a change to mortgage
indemnity insurance which makes it harder for building societies to obtain
insurance on such mortgages.
The tightening of insurance policies has led the council to call for local
authorities to take a role in helping to provide the insurance.
Ministers are determined that the problem will not hinder the new campaign
and are anxious to get an agreement with building societies before it starts
later this month.
Ministers will also discuss with the lenders the prospect of providing
fixed-rate mortgages on former council properties, so that potential
purchasers will know how much they will have to pay over the next few years.
The campaign will also stress the cash incentive scheme, through which a
tenant in, for example, a tower block flat which they do not want to buy can
receive a cash lump sum towards buying a home in the private sector.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Small player looks for a chance to stay in the game: The man
who is leading the buy-out attempt at Leyland Daf Vans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGING director Mr Allan Amey and five colleagues launching a management
buy-out attempt today for Leyland Daf Vans in Birmingham know they must
explain an apparent paradox to potential backers.
Backers are certain to ask how such a small vanmaker could possibly be
viable.
There are 190 employees still working in the Birmingham plant who are
subcontracted to Renault of France. They are developing the new van range
which Renault and Daf had intended to launch jointly at a cost approaching
Pounds 400m if Daf and its Leyland Daf subsidiary had not collapsed into
receivership.
Renault will move this Excel van project to France later this year for sale
throughout Europe at projected volumes approaching 100,000 a year.
The company envisaged by Mr Amey's management buy-out would have no access
to this van range, and would seek to modernise the current Leyland Daf
200/400 van range, which has its origins in the British Leyland Sherpa van
launched 20 years ago.
Further, the buy-out company's sales activities would, initially at least,
be confined mainly to the UK market, where Leyland Daf sold fewer than
14,000 vans last year. The new Daf company formed in the Netherlands and
Belgium has already made plain that vans will not form part of its
activities. So until alternative distribution arrangements could be made, an
EC market which last year absorbed 7,000 Leyland Daf vans would be lost to
the Birmingham production lines.
Mr Amey, 46, who has run Leyland Daf Vans for the past three years,
questions that being a small player should be seen as a problem. 'Big
doesn't necessarily mean anything except the potential for big profit - or
big losses. You've simply got to be the right size for your market,' he
says.
'Excel is a massive project to design, develop and produce a completely new
van. We won't do that, at least in the short term.
'Our customers want economic load-carrying capacity at a competitive price.
We can provide that today. But instead of revolution, like the Excel, we can
evolve the product perfectly satisfactorily.'
He acknowledges that Ford and other vanmakers might seek to move in for the
kill with a price war, but says the company is already well versed in
fighting its corner.
The breakeven level for the Birminghan operation is believed to have been
about 14,000 units a year before the Daf takeover. Mr Amey says this can be
cut sharply. The plan envisages an operation of such a size that the 'vast
majority' of the remaining 1,200 workers would be retained.
As for backers, Mr Amey gives a clear hint that short- termism is not on the
agenda. 'We are intent on the long-term development of the product and
processes, and the foundations necessary for them.'
As for assumptions that little investment has been made at the Birmingham
facilities in recent years, Mr Amey insists that this is not true. 'Millions
have been spent in the past few years, particularly on the factory structure
. . . in terms of facilities, there is the risk of confusing low technology
with fitness of purpose.'
With pledges of support also made at last week's Leyland Daf dealers'
council, 'realistically, we think the vast body of the network will stay
loyal and work with us to develop our market', Mr Amey insists.
The management team - which includes finance director Mr Roger Cable,
marketing director Mr Malcolm Jefferies, commercial operations director Mr
Jim Parks, technical director Mr John Rae and manufacturing director Mr Tony
Sergeant - has already held talks with local Department of Trade and
Industry officials on whether the buy-out qualifies for regional selective
assistance.
Otherwise, Mr Amey said, 'the financial net is wide open'. He added: 'A
number of financial institutions have already contacted us to say that 'when
you're ready, come and talk to us'. We have to be cautious, though - we
don't want anyone taking a 45 per cent stake on a three-year, sell-it-off
basis.'
He insists the business plan is predicated on a viable, stand-alone
operation. 'But it would be wrong at any point to be blinkered. If an
opportunity came along which it was felt might be in our best interest, then
naturally we would explore it fully.'

MR JOHN SMITH, the Labour leader, will today call for an end to the
traditional Budget 'purdah' arrangements, as part of a move to bring greater
openness to the government's economic decision-making.
In a speech to Charter 88, the constitutional reform movement, Mr Smith will
also extend the idea of a 'new deal' for the citizen beyond the customary
ground of a ministry of justice, a bill of rights and wider eligibility for
legal aid.

Some of the biggest company members of the CBI have protested to the

FT  01 MAR 93 / Managers' pay rises by 3.7%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID fall in the rate of inflation seems to have taken many companies
by surprise, resulting in larger than intended salary increases for private
sector managers, a survey of pay over the three months to January reveals.
Overall, managerial and professional salary rises averaged 3.7 per cent
between November 1992 and January 1993, compared with an average of 4 per
cent for the previous quarter. When pay freezes are excluded, the figure for
the average rise in the last quarter rises to 4 per cent, ranging from, a
1.5 per cent average rise at Apricot Computers, to up to 7 per cent for
senior managers at Kraft General Foods.
The independent pay research group, Incomes Data Services, which compiled
the figures, has found one in six companies imposing pay freezes on
managers' salaries.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Lord Pennock: ICI deputy chairman and CBI president
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD PENNOCK, former deputy chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries and
president of the Confederation of British Industry, died last week aged 72.
Raymond Pennock spent more than 30 years at ICI, initially in personnel and
later as head of the agricultural operations. He was appointed a director in
1972 and became deputy chairman between 1975 and 1980.
Knighted in 1978 for his services to exports, he was widely tipped as a
possible chairman of ICI, but the position went to Sir Maurice Hodgson.
Between 1980 and 1982 he was president of the CBI and at the end of his term
he was made a life peer.
In 1980 he became chairman of BICC, the cables and construction group, where
he was already a director.
He stayed at the post until 1984, helping to turn the company around.
His entry in Who's Who mentions his directorship at Eurotunnel, but not his
unhappy year-long stint as the group's co-chairman between 1986 and 1987.
He stepped down after criticisms from the Bank of England about the handling
of an international share placing which almost failed.
Lord Pennock, an energetic committee member, was a member of the National
Economic Development Council from 1979 to 1982.
He was the first British president of the Union of European Community
Industries from 1984 to 1986 and was president of the Chemical Industries
Association in 1978 and 1979.
He was a director of Morgan Grenfell and deputy chairman of Standard
Chartered Bank and Plessey.
In 1943 he married Lorna Pearse and they had a son and two daughters.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Major to re-assert authority over rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR will this week seek to re-assert his authority over Tory
Euro-rebels after the disclosure of a meeting between two senior rightwing
ministers and Baroness Thatcher.
Tory party officials were at pains to point out that Maastricht had not been
discussed at the lunch last Thursday attended by Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, Treasury chief secretary. They
also underlined that both cabinet ministers had consistently voted for the
Maastricht bill in its passage through the Commons.
While the meeting with Lady Thatcher is a sign of the confidence of the Tory
right wing, no one at Westminster seriously expects a ministerial exodus
over Maastricht.
Instead, the most sensitive issue is the government's attitude towards the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Mr Major has said that the UK will not rejoin the mechanism this year, but
some right-wing ministers are letting it be known that there should be no
question of rejoining during the lifetime of this parliament.
Although Downing Street was relaxed about the lunch - also attended by Lord
Tebbit, a leading Euro-sceptic, and Sir Alan Walters, formerly Lady
Thatcher's economic adviser - its timing is particularly awkward.
A week ago ministers faced renewed embarrassment over the bill but fought
back with a display by loyalist MPs at a private meeting of Tory backbench
MPs on Thursday aimed at putting the Euro-sceptics on the defensive.
Today Mr Major will discuss the handling of the Maastricht legislation with
Mr Richard Ryder, the chief whip, Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords, and
other business managers.
The bill returns to the Commons on Thursday and ministers are keen that it
regains some of the momentum it has lost recently.
Mr Major will also discuss today with Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory party
chairman, his speech at the Tory central council on Saturday.
The prime minister intends to use the speech to set out more fully the
renewed Tory emphasis on crime and press home the causes for economic
optimism.
The gathering of constituency officers will also give party managers an
opportunity to exert pressure on some dissident Tory MPs through their local
party associations.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Backbench MPs support phasing out of mortgage interest tax
relief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHASING OUT of mortgage interest tax relief is supported by 55 per cent
of backbench MPs, according to a survey commissioned by the housing charity
Shelter, Alan Pike writes.
Shelter says MPs of all parties endorse proposals for better targeted help
for homeowners, which it is publishing today.
The charity wants the government to accompany the ending of tax relief -
which costs the exchequer Pounds 5bn a year - with other arrangements for
helping the needy.
These might include a mortgage benefit scheme, based on existing housing
benefit, or an alternative form of assistance for low-income home owners,
and a review of further ways to help with housing costs.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of Shelter, said the recent record mortgage
arrears and repossessions had 'highlighted the absurdity of the current
mortgage tax relief policy'.
The call to abolish mortgage tax relief is supported by the Tory Reform
Group, a moderate Conservative pressure group, in its Budget submission to
the chancellor.
It believes tax relief should be phased out over five years. In the
meantime, the group argues, the chancellor should stimulate the housing
market by offering homebuyers a cash alternative to tax relief.
Such one-off payments would, it suggests, be about Pounds 2,000 initially
and diminish annually.
'This would help to encourage first-time buyers, offsetting the current
incentive to remain outside the market while prices continue to fall,' it
says.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Civil servants without salaries after blunder: Computer
system overlooks 65,000 payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 65,000 Department of Employment staff are waiting this morning to see
if the government will keep its promise that a cheque is in the post. A
clerical slip in the department's computers has left its employees without
last month's pay.
'The error is going to cost an awful lot of money,' said department
officials, who declined to disclose details.
The personnel division has agreed to pay any overdraft or bank charges
incurred by staff because of the mistake.
After the problem emerged on Friday morning senior officials and managers
spent hours making arrangements, so far as they could, to tide staff over.
'It was a bit of a panic,' admitted one official.
Managers agreed with some building societies to credit staff's accounts on
Saturday. Others rushed around organising Giro and cash payments to
employees relying on their salaries over the weekend.
Officials were relieved to confirm that the department's ministers - Mrs
Gillian Shephard, Mr Michael Forsyth, Mr Patrick McLoughlin and Viscount
Ullswater - had received their salaries on time because they have separate
pay arrangements.
'We weren't that surprised,' says Mr Ian Taylor, national officer of the
National Union of Clerical and Public Servants for the Department of
Em-ployment. 'It's happened before - about five or six years ago.'
The exact cause of the embarrassment has not yet been tracked down. It was
only revealed on Thursday evening when the Bank of England ran the
department's faulty tapes.
Mr Taylor said he understood someone had failed to tell the computers to pay
out on Friday rather than on the last day of the month, a Sunday.
The cost will not be known until all affected employees have submitted
claims, but the department will almost certainly have to absorb it from
within its existing budget.
Mr Taylor said: 'We accept that errors occur. Providing the cheques are
available today, we'll put it down to human error.'

FT  01 MAR 93 / Dispute delays Sellafield plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX, Environment Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TENSION IS rising in government departments over the question of whether
British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield site will be used to store other
countries' radioactive waste for many decades.
The Trade and Industry Department received a report from the government's
Radioactive Waste Management Advisory Committee before Christmas saying that
Sellafield could be used for long-term waste storage, but the department has
so far refused to discuss the implications with the Environment Department.
BNF has repeatedly rejected charges that its Sellafield-based Thorp plant
for reprocessing nuclear fuels, which has taken nearly 10 years and Pounds
2.8bn to build, would become a 'nuclear dustbin'. It argues that most of its
overseas contracts require customers to take back reprocessed waste.
The latest tension arises over a BNF 'waste substitution' proposal - which
means customers will take back only the 'radiological equivalent of their
waste'. Under this proposal large volumes of waste would be left at
Sellafield.
BNF wants Thorp to start operating soon. Unless the waste substitution plan
is implemented, however, this may not happen. Japanese customers, who with
German customers account for much of Thorp's order book, have made
preparations to take back only a small amount of highly radioactive waste.
While some customers have said publicly that they are committed to their
contracts with BNF, others are increasingly apprehensive about taking back
the reprocessed waste because of the high storage and shipping costs and
political sensitivity.
Environment Department officials have been refused some details of BNF's
customer contracts by the Trade Department on grounds of commercial
confidentiality, making an assessment of long-term waste storage at
Sellafield more difficult.
Before Thorp can start operating it needs authorisation from the Pollution
Inspectorate.
According to one official the inspectorate is unlikely to submit its
recommendation to the Environment Department before May because the decision
has become so sensitive that 'we need to be seen to get every dot and comma
right'.
BNF has claimed that if Thorp does not go ahead the UK will lose Pounds 900m
in profit in the next 10 years. Officials are concerned, however, that
difficulties over sending reprocessed waste back to customers could
undermine those projections.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Birt expected to keep freelance deal at BBC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, who became BBC director-general in January, is likely to
continue to be paid as a freelance consultant rather than as an employee,
just as he has since joining the corporation in 1987, it emerged yesterday.
A senior BBC governor said he did not expect there to be any pressure from
the board of governors on Mr Birt to change his status.
Financial details of John Birt Productions, a private company owned by Mr
Birt and his wife Jane, were disclosed yesterday.
Mr Birt's salary from the BBC, believed to be between Pounds 135,000 and
Pounds 140,000 in the year to August 1991, was paid gross to his private
company.
This meant the director-general was able to deduct more than Pounds 30,000
in administrative expenses and pay income tax only on the Pounds 59,000 he
was paid by John Birt Productions.
Mr Birt has not yet signed a contract with the BBC as director-general but a
committee of the board of governors, including Mr Marmaduke Hussey, the
chairman, has already agreed that Mr Birt can be paid in his normal way
through John Birt Productions.
The arrangement is legal and has apparently been accepted by the Inland
Revenue.
The revelation that Mr Birt is not being paid as a full-time employee of the
BBC is, however, likely to be controversial.
It is not unusual in the television industry for entertainers, presenters,
senior reporters, producers and directors to be paid as freelancers. With
the increase in independent production and the growing move to short-term
contracts, this is becoming more common. But it is extremely unusual for
senior executives of the BBC to be paid in such a way. The BBC said
yesterday that no other member of the corporation's board of management was
paid as a freelance consultant. That includes Mr Bob Phillis, who arrives
soon as deputy director-general.
Although there are examples of such practices in ITV - Mr Brian Tesler, the
former chief executive of London Weekend Television, is believed to have had
such a contract - they are still considered unusual at senior executive
level. In the past 10 years, for example, no directors of Thames Television
were paid on such a basis.
At director level, the trend has been the other way. Share options, which
have turned, or are about to turn, many ITV executives into millionaires are
difficult to arrange for those not employed directly. Redundancy money is
also available only to employees.
The BBC said in a statement: 'John Birt has either been a freelance or has
contracted his services through his own company on fixed-term contracts for
over 20 years. The same contractual arrangements that operated when he was
director of programmes at LWT applied when he joined the BBC as deputy
director-general.'
The arrangement means that Mr Birt will almost certainly be paying less
income tax than many of his subordinates.
The Inland Revenue said it would not comment on any individual's tax
affairs, Andrew Jack writes. But it said there was an official in every tax
office charged with determining whether individuals should be permitted to
be registered to pay tax as self-employed.
It is far easier to gain tax deductions under Schedule D, the tax system for
the self-employed, than it is using the pay-as-you-earn system. Many
allowances against tax - such as entertainment - are permitted if they are a
legitimate part of the business.
Under PAYE, by contrast, only items which are 'wholly, necessarily and
exclusively' work-related can be claimed against tax.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Cancer therapy ready for trials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Imperial Cancer Research Fund plans to test in patients later this year
a genetic treatment for melanoma, Europe's fastest-increasing form of
cancer.
Scientists with the fund said yesterday that their 'gene therapy' had given
promising results in experiments with cell cultures and mice. They will
apply next week for government approval to start human trials at the fund's
Oxford Clinical Oncology Unit.
Melanoma is the most dangerous form of skin cancer. Its incidence in the UK
is doubling every decade and it kills about 1,300 people a year - many of
them young adults. Although melanoma can be cured by surgery if it is caught
early, the later stages are usually fatal.
Dr Michael Crumpton, the fund's laboratories director, said the gene therapy
technique developed for melanoma could be extended to other untreatable
cancers. 'We believe we have an exciting discovery with important clinical
implications for the treatment of tumours.'
The prospect of inserting killer genes into cancers is emerging as one of
the most promising avenues of medical research. Several US teams are
developing gene therapy for cancer.
One distinctive feature of the fund's approach is its simplicity. The
British scientists inject their chosen genes, in the form of a few
millionths of a gram of DNA, directly into the melanoma with a
micro-syringe. Their animal experiments suggest that this works as well as
more complicated US techniques.
Laboratory tests by the fund show that a 'promoter gene' can 'switch on'
other genes in melanoma cells but not elsewhere in the body.
Now the scientists are hooking on to the promoter other genes that will
provoke an attack on the targeted cells. The fund says the effect is like
sprinkling a selective weedkiller over a lawn.
They will try first a gene that instructs melanoma cells to make a substance
called interleukin-2, which will stimulate the body's immune system to
attack the cancer.
Simply injecting IL-2 into patients has an effect on melanoma, but only at
high doses which cause severe side-effects. The ICRF team hopes that
localised production of IL-2 will kill the tumour without causing damage
elsewhere.
Prof Adrian Harris of the Oxford Clinical Oncology Unit expects to receive
approval to start clinical trials before the end of the year. Gene therapy
for cancer is unlikely to be widely available for five to 10 years.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Can Britain make it?: Foreign ownership handicaps
electronics - FT writers make a closer examination of two sectors that have
traditionally been strong, in our series on manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRITISH manufacturing may have declined, but the electronics sector
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
consisting of telecommunications, consumer electronics, information
technology and components - seems in better shape today than it has been for
many years.
The UK now has the fourth largest electronics industry in the world after
the US, Japan and Germany. The industry accounted for about 15 per cent of
the UK's visible exports last year.
A quarter of the large-screen television sets produced in western Europe are
made in Britain and 59 per cent of Europe's personal computer production
comes from the UK and Ireland.
The critical question is whether the health of the sector is sustainable or
a transitory phenomenon which could be slowed or reversed by decisions taken
abroad. US computer maker Digital Equipment's decision to close its computer
manufacturing plant in Galway, Ireland, is a case in point.
Mr John Gardner, managing director of computer maker ICL's UK operations,
points to the difficulty of drawing conclusions in a global business where
manufacturers site production according to market requirements. The Far East
is falling out of favour as European manufacturers improve efficiency.
Transport and distribution costs are lower when production is geographically
close to a company's principal markets, he argues.
The bright spots are dazzling. Applied Materials of the US, one of the
world's largest makers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, carries out
the research and development for its most sophisticated instruments in
Horsham, West Sussex. The Santa Cruz Operation, a leading US software house,
last week bought IXI, a tiny Cambridge company, to acquire IXI's unique
technology.
These examples, however, illustrate the predicament of the UK industry.
Local levels of skill and inventiveness are high but the companies are often
in foreign hands. The trade association for consumer electronics
manufacturers has 16 members but only one is British-owned.
Mr Geoffrey Shingles, chairman of the UK subsidiary of Digital Equipment, is
convinced the government should do more to encourage home grown market
leaders. 'The UK has always been good at small start-up companies. What we
have not done well is to grow companies able to compete at global level,' he
says.
The result is that Britain's trade deficit in electronics last year was
about Pounds 1.4bn but there are signs of improvement. Last year electronics
exports were 15 per cent smaller than imports. Ten years ago the gap was
twice as large. Some of the improvement is due to recession but the primary
reason is extensive foreign investment.
The most obvious example is consumer electronics, where the deficit is now
only a quarter of the Pounds 1.1bn reached in 1983. Sony started making
television sets in south Wales in the 1970s and inward investment
accelerated in the last decade. Now the list of UK-made Japanese products
includes video recorders from Mitsubishi, compact disc players from Pioneer,
mobile phones from NEC and TV sets from Matsushita and JVC.
Mr Hugh Peltor, director of Brema, the consumer electronics trade
association, says 'We have done well in inward investment.'
The recovery in telecommunications has different origins. The privatisation
of BT created a wave of demand for new equipment and services from BT and
its competitor Mercury in the 1980s. At the same time, the privatisation
freed BT to buy equipment from abroad, hence stimulating competition in the
home market.
In the past couple of years the investment wave has abated, so cutting
imports. But at the same time, UK suppliers - chiefly the part-German owned
GPT and Canada's Northern Telecom - have been sharpened by competitive
pressures.
Now they are waiting for the closed and regulated telecommunications markets
of mainland Europe to follow the UK's liberalised example.
The mainland European markets could offer rich pickings when they are
opened. It is thought that Deutsche Bundespost Telekom is paying two to
three times as much as BT for comparable German equipment in a tightly
regulated market.
Computer software has often been touted as an area where the UK should
excel. The value of computer software and services purchased worldwide will
soon exceed the value of computer hardware.
The industry is dominated by US companies such as Microsoft and Lotus,
however, and there are no signs the position will change.
Nevertheless, the electronics industry gives grounds for modest optimism
although nobody should expect it to become a shooting star in the UK's
economic firmament. The chief concern is its dependence on inward
investment, where fashions may change suddenly and without warning.

manufacturing medicines should be secure. It has two of the world's top six
pharmaceuticals groups, the world's best-selling drug (Zantac) and a record
trade surplus last year of Pounds 1.3bn.
But the outlook is worrying. Although exports have grown from Pounds 139m in
1970 to Pounds 2.99bn in 1992, the rate of import penetration has grown
faster.
Whereas exports exceeded imports by a factor of four in 1970, the ratio was
1.5 by last year.
One reason for this is that British doctors are prescribing increasing
numbers of foreign drugs. According to Lehman Brothers in London, the second
largest prescription drugs company in the UK by sales last year was Astra of
Sweden, rather than UK groups such as SmithKline Beecham, Wellcome or
Fisons.
UK-based companies continue to discover and market world-class drugs,
however. Six of the world's 20 top selling drugs in 1991 were developed by
British companies.
But many British groups are manufacturing a larger proportion of their drugs
abroad.
Dr Joe Blaker, group technical director in charge of manufacturing at Glaxo,
the biggest drugs group in the UK and Europe, explains: 'It would be
inappropriate for a global drugs concern like us to put all our
manufacturing facilities in one country, even if we are a British-based
company.'
Dr Blaker says that the turning point came in the early 1980s when Glaxo
began to internationalise its research and development activities.
The aim was to tap scientific expertise outside the UK. By locating drug
development in markets such as the US, products were also likely to be
licensed by regulatory authorities more quickly.
Overseas manufacturing soon followed the research and development push.
Manufacturing problems can be ironed out faster by locating production near
research and development centres, allowing drugs groups to launch products
earlier.
Dr Blaker says: 'Ten years ago the US market was almost entirely supplied by
product from the UK - the American manufacturing side was very embryonic.'
Glaxo's sales to the US in the last six months of 1992 were Pounds 954m.
Last year Glaxo's UK manufacturing investment was Pounds 72m, compared with
Pounds 124m outside the UK. Over the last four years manufacturing
investment overseas has been greater than that in the UK.
The company is currently building a Pounds 100m complex in Singapore to
manufacture primary materials for medicines. It already manufactures 53 per
cent of its product volume outside the UK.
Glaxo's example is not unique. Wellcome manufactures an increasing amount
overseas. While 65 per cent of the active ingredients for its medicines are
manufactured in the UK, only 40 per cent of its finished products are made
in Britain.
The company says local production plants are more easily able to deal with
local requirements, such as dosing, packaging and leaflets.
The future of the UK's leading drugs groups is not in doubt. The best -
Glaxo, SmithKline Beecham and Wellcome - continue to attain double-digit
earnings growth. But the benefits of their success for Britain's export
balance are likely to diminish.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Surveys find signs of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE of the first increase in manufacturing activity in eight months is
claimed by the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply in its monthly
survey today.
A separate survey of consumer purchasing intentions by Verdict Research,
retail analysts, also says that its results for last month are the first to
justify optimism in an economic upturn.
The institute's survey of UK purchasing managers shows a rise in its overall
purchasing managers' index from 49.3 per cent in January to 51.2 per cent
last month. Index readings below 50 per cent suggest that the manufacturing
economy is generally declining, while readings above 50 per cent point to an
expansion.
Two components of the purchasing managers' index - the output index and new
orders index - have both stood above 50 per cent for the past four months.
The output measure rose from 50.2 per cent to 53.8 per cent between January
and February and the new orders index from 52.8 per cent to 53.9 per cent -
although in December it was 54.1 per cent.
The institute attributes the improvements to stronger demand, increased
sales and improved confidence. Devaluation continued to affect order books
as a number of companies reported an increase in overseas orders.
Verdict says the most encouraging feature of its survey - which tracks
consumers' intentions to purchase property, cars and large household items
over the next six months - is the upturn in intentions to move house. The
proportion of people interviewed who planned to move rose to 6 per cent in
February, following five consecutive months at 4 per cent. Verdict concludes
that its results 'confirm the beginnings of better times' in the housing
market.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Nigeria may need debt relief to secure democracy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ERNEST Shonekan, chairman of Nigeria's transitional council, faces an
unenviable task. Six months is not long for the council, which will run the
country under military supervision until an elected government is installed
in August, to re-impose fiscal and monetary discipline and devise a credible
medium-term economic strategy. But unless radical changes occur, and soon,
Nigeria's new civilian government risks sinking in a mire of inflation,
economic stagnation and civilian unrest.
Nigeria's return to democracy could hardly have come at a more difficult
time. Over the past year, the scale of recent economic mismanagement has
emerged. Domestic credit expansion doubled in the first nine months of 1992,
compared to the previous year; annual inflation has risen to 45 per cent;
the budget deficit has more than doubled since 1989 to over 12 per cent of
GDP; and the exchange rate has collapsed, falling from 18 naira to the
dollar a year ago to over 30 naira in last week's cancelled foreign exchange
auction.
The transitional council has wasted little time. It has announced a
three-year plan to reduce the fiscal deficit as a percentage of GDP to 3.3
per cent in 1995 and cut inflation to 5 per cent, hoping this will allow it
to negotiate an extended structural adjustment facility with the IMF and
reschedule Nigeria's external debts.
Yet Mr Shonekan must also persuade the civilian government to persist with
IMF-style structural adjustment. Nigeria's own Structural Adjustment
Programme (SAP), instituted in 1986, may have halted the decline in the
country's fledgling manufacturing base. However there is little evidence to
suggest it has stopped the fall in living standards that has persisted
throughout President Babangida's seven-year military rule. The combination
of falling oil prices and exchange rate depreciation has reduced average
real income per head from Dollars 1,000 in 1980 to a mere Dollars 290 in
1991, making Nigeria one of sub-Saharan Africa's poorest countries, as well
as its most populous.
Structural adjustment has been impeded by the debilitating drain on
resources from Nigeria's external debt which has grown since the SAP began,
as the upper chart shows. Nigeria's external debt stood at Dollars 27.6bn
last year, about 100 per cent of Nigeria's GDP. Over 60 per cent of this
debt is now owed to members of the Paris Club of government creditors, with
the UK still the largest single creditor.
World Bank officials describe this debt burden as unsustainably high.
Without rescheduling, interest payments would average Dollars 5bn a year in
1993-96, consuming 36 per cent of Nigeria's total export revenue compared to
an average 19 per cent for all developing countries last year and 30 per
cent for severely indebted countries.
Yet the Paris Club continues to treat Nigeria as a middle-income country,
even though it is officially classified as a heavily indebted low-income
country and qualifies for concessional debt relief. Debt rescheduling on
middle-income country terms merely reduces the interest burden today by
raising it in the future while leaving the debt stock little changed.
A sustainable solution requires outright debt reduction, either using the
enhanced Toronto terms or the more generous Trinidad terms which were
proposed in 1991 but have never been applied by the Paris Club. The Trinidad
terms imply a a one-off reduction of two-thirds of eligible debt and an
extended repayment period. But the cost of rescheduling Nigeria's debts on
concessional terms exceeds that for the rest of sub-Saharan Africa combined.
The coming months are critical for Nigeria. The UK has said it will consider
a unilateral application of the Trinidad terms if Nigeria can reach an IMF
agreement. But without substantial debt relief, preferably linked to public
sector reform to root out corruption, Nigeria has little chance of
sustaining an IMF programme. The Shonekan government offers only a brief
window of opportunity for western creditors to do a conditional deal with a
non-elected civilian authority for the new elected administration to
inherit. It is a chance which may not recur.

talks between rival Afghan leaders in neighbouring Pakistan, Reuter reports
from Kabul.
Two mortar bombs exploded among crowds in the Feruzhgar bazaar, killing 14
people and injuring more than 60 in the bloodiest attacks since an informal
ceasefire took effect two weeks ago.
The Defence Ministry blamed the hardline dissident Hezb-i-Islami party of
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar for shattering the ceasefire and bombarding the city
with more than 40 rockets and shells.

FT  01 MAR 93 / China boosts trade drive in S Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA will extend its trade drive to South Africa next month when it opens
its first trade fair there, a move that suggests that the establishment of
formal diplomatic relations with Pretoria may not be far off.
About 80 Chinese companies will participate in the Trade Expo organised by
the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and to be held in
Johannesburg from April 19 to 25.
The CCPIT-organised fair in South Africa is one of 22 planned
internationally and coincides with a rapid increase in China's exports,
expected to reach Dollars 100bn (Pounds 70.4bn) this year.
China's efforts further to accelerate its trade growth - it is expected to
leap into the top 10 of the world's trading nations this year - comes as
Beijing intensifies its attempts to rejoin the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade. China and the US formally resume Gatt talks in Beijing this week
after a three-year break following the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
China and South Africa last year established visa-issuing representative
offices known as 'research centres' in each other's capitals as preparation
for full normalisation.
China, which has been discreetly trading with South Africa for many years,
has said that formal relations would follow further constitutional reforms,
including agreement on a national unity government pending elections.
The foreign ministers of the two countries have exchanged visits. South
Africa's Mr Pik Botha visited Beijing in 1991 and China's Mr Qian Qichen
went to Pretoria last year.
Gold-hungry Chinese consumers spent the equivalent of Dollars 4.3bn on gold
jewellery last year, according to China's official Business Weekly.
Quoting a report of the Geneva-based World Gold Council, the newspaper said
that, based on 'conservative estimates', jewellery sales in China exceeded
250 tons.
This was equivalent to one quarter of all the gold sales in Asia - a region
that is traditionally a big gold consumer. Taiwanese buy about 10 grams of
gold on average a year, Hong Kong residents 6 grams and China 1.8 grams.
The huge Chinese demand for gold jewellery has been partly spurred by
concerns about the depreciating value of the local currency - the renminbi -
and also by growing affluence in a country where economic growth last year
topped 12 per cent.
The World Gold Council, an association of producers, said that it would
devote more resources to developing the gold market in China. It planned to
target women consumers.
The People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, has purchased large
quantities of gold in the past year, but the Chinese have not disclosed
details. China has not divulged the extent of its gold reserves for more
than 10 years.

FT  01 MAR 93 / S Africans get the taste for disclosure: Pressure is growing
on government to clean up its act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE twilight months of white rule, South Africans have discovered a taste
for public disclosure: not just for chilling revelations of human rights
abuse, but for evidence of economic crimes and misdeeds that have been
buried for years under apartheid - and would probably have brought down a
government in any western country.
Over the past week the auditor general, Mr Peter Wronsley, has published the
accounts of government departments and statutory bodies showing widespread
mismanagement and abuse. Local newspapers have attacked the large perks paid
to government ministers. And a member of parliament from the liberal
Democratic party pointed out in the House that, although financial scandals
involving R5bn (Pounds 1.1bn) in expenditure had been disclosed over the
past 18 months, no minister had been sacked or had resigned.
Some 35 government officials are under investigation for corruption, 16 have
been or are being tried, with six convicted so far.
The unspoken message is that the white government must clean up its public
management act before handing over to a mostly-black administration. Most
whites and some blacks assume, by African precedent, that this will do an
even worse job of managing public finances.
However, exasperation with the ruling National party has reached such levels
that white callers to a recent popular phone-in show, on Johannesburg's
Radio 702, have begun to say regularly that they cannot imagine a black
government exceeding National party mismanagement.
The auditor general's report for last year condemns weak management systems
and inadequate financial controls, especially in the South African Defence
Force (half of whose budget is earmarked for secret funds, on which he did
not comment) and the Department of Foreign Affairs, which provides billions
of rands in funding annually (R5.4bn last year) to the nominally independent
homelands of Transkei, Ciskei, Bophuthatswana and Venda.
Mr Wronsley found, overall, that he could not publish unqualified audits for
three government departments and 14 statutory institutions, and that he
could express no opinion on the accounts of two other government bodies.
But he condemned most severely the black homelands for failing to keep to
financial guidelines, overspending on salaries and poor project controls,
and said he doubted whether Transkei, Venda and Ciskei could repay some
R3.3bn in debts guaranteed by South Africa.
Threatened now with reincorporation into a unitary South Africa, homeland
officials are widely suspected of siphoning off large sums as protection
against an uncertain future.
Only a day later, parliament's joint committee on public accounts criticised
projects by the now-disbanded secret military unit, the Civil Co-operation
Bureau, widely alleged to be involved in the murders of anti-apartheid
activists: the committee questioned R13m in what it considered unauthorised
or improper spending.
As the new South Africa approaches, allegations abound of government
officials fiddling with pension entitlements to insure against racially
motivated retrenchments. This includes a recent case in which 4,000 white
teachers were offered early retirement (with pension) by the white education
department, but left free to sign up for fresh employment (and a new
pension) with the separate departments which administer non-white education.
Whatever its shortcomings, the National party is likely to pay no immediate
price for poor administration of public funds: South Africans know they have
no choice but to continue supporting the party if they seek a stable
transition to majority rule.
But as the Johannesburg daily, Business Day, commented last week, the public
must continue to demand accountability or 'the voting public will have only
itself to blame when the pattern of corruption continues'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US expects further concessions soon from Israel on the difficult issue
of the fate of the 400 Palestinian deportees, according to Mr Warren
Christopher, the secretary of state.
In a TV interview yesterday, Mr Christopher, just back from his first Middle
East tour as secretary of state, said the deportee problem was 'on its way
to resolution.'
He refused to disclose any details but added that the new developments 'will
give reassurance to the Palestinians' and, in his opinion, would make all
the more likely the attendance of the Palestinian delegation at the Middle
East peace talks due to reconvene in April.
He was particularly encouraged that those Arab leaders to whom he had spoken
and who had influence over the Palestinians all thought there was now 'a
moment of opportunity' for the peace process to get under way again.
This had been brought about, he said, by the fact that the US was now seen
again to be willing to play an active leadership role as an 'honest broker'.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Indian budget signals loosening of economic reins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK ago, a leading Indian economist said he believed the finance minister
would 'wait another six to nine months before letting the economy go.
There's so much he still has to put right.'
But Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, decided not to wait. This
weekend's budget is a bet that, after a squeeze which started in mid-1991,
the Indian economy is now ready for solid and long-lasting expansion.
It is also an acknowledgement that, after the Ayodhya crisis, Mr P V
Narasimha Rao's government is in need of recovering popular support for
itself and for economic reform. As Mr Singh said in his budget speech: 'I
have used this budget as an opportunity to put economic and social
development firmly back on the national agenda.'
Initial indications are that Mr Singh has succeeded - at least temporarily.
Most industrialists, economists and newspaper columnists welcomed his
budget. The question is whether there will be an economic price to be paid
for this burst of popularity.
Mr Singh had the scope to prime the economy principally because of the
severity of the previous austerity drive which has cut inflation rapidly and
reduced the fiscal deficit. The fiscal deficit has dropped from 8.4 per cent
in 1990-1991 to just over 5 per cent. Officials said that if they left
revenue and spending policies unchanged, the deficit would fall in 1993-94
to 3.5 per cent.
Tax relief, mainly reductions in customs duties, will inject some Rs45bn
(Pounds 1.03bn) into the economy. The largest duty cuts will come on capital
goods, raw materials and components - so manufacturers will benefit, though
they are expected to pass on gains to consumers. Industry is also pleased
with the 1 percentage point cut in interest rates and with tax breaks for
investments in key sectors such as power. Mr R C Bhargava, the chairman of
Maruti, a leading car maker, commented: 'The days of recession are over.'
The increases in public spending are aimed at ameliorating some of India's
chronic weaknesses and winning support for economic reform from poorer
people who benefit little from import duty cuts. Project spending in rural
development is going up by 62 per cent, in education 37 per cent and in
power investment 22 per cent.
The exchange rate reform will also tend to increase government spending.
Until this weekend, India has operated two exchange rates - a market rate
(last week Rs33 to the Dollars ) and an official rate (Rs26). Exporters and
other owners of foreign exchange have been required to change 60 per cent of
their funds at market rates and 40 per cent at official rates. The official
rate is now abolished - so the government must buy foreign exchange at
market prices.
Finance ministry officials argue that now is an opportune time to end their
squeeze and float the rupee. World oil prices, interest rates and inflation
rates are low, so India is cushioned against price shocks. They hope the G7
developed countries' efforts to stimulate growth will boost Indian exports -
perhaps by 15 per cent in 1993-94. Export-led growth would promote
non-inflationary expansion at home and fund the imports India needs to equip
and modernise its industry.
If the economy develops as planned, Congress (I) can fight elections this
year or next, basking in the glow of prosperity. While general elections are
not due until 1996, the Bharatiya Janata Party, the right-wing Hindu party
whose supporters stormed the Ayodhya mosque, is demanding an early poll.
Elections in four states where BJP governments have been suspended are
likely to be held this year.
However, three potential dangers loom on the economic horizon. First, with
70 per cent of the labour force in agriculture, India's economic progress is
still critically dependent on the weather. A good monsoon last year boosted
growth; a poor one now could hinder it and fuel inflation.
Next, exporters may not be able to respond quickly to the rupee's flotation,
even though it should increase their revenues. Indian manufacturers still
suffer from foreign buyers' doubts about quality and delivery schedules. If
exports stay sluggish but imports grow in response to duty cuts, the current
account deficit will soar, putting expansion in jeopardy.
Finally, Mr Singh has postponed some difficult issues such as extending the
scope of the tax net. There is no mention of plans for labour law reform -
including increasing employers' rights to sack redundant workers. There is
political advantage from these delays - but economic modernisation will
require that these problems are tackled.
Mr Singh is aware serious structural reforms are still needed. His budget
contains substantial moves to prepare India's financial system for
liberalisation. Notably, the government is injecting Rs57bn in capital into
the state-owned banks to help them provide for bad debt. Mr Singh is also
cutting the funds they must lend at low rates to the government - from 36
per cent of deposits to 25 per cent over three years - thus releasing more
funds for commercial lending. Further, there are measures to beef up
supervision of banking and securities after last year's Bombay securities
scandal.
There is no doubting Mr Singh's personal commitment to pro-market reform.
However, it is worth remembering that the initial impetus for reform came
not from any ideological conversion in favour of free markets in the finance
ministry but from the shock of a balance of payments crisis. As the memory
of that crisis fades, so it will become more difficult to advance
politically unpopular changes.
THE MAIN POINTS
The Rupee is to be fully floated from today. The present two exchange rates,
official and market, will be replaced by a single market rate.
Import duties slashed with maximum rate cut from 110 per cent to 85 per
cent. General capital goods rate cut from 55 per cent to 35 per cent with
further cuts for export-oriented industries and power generation and
distribution.
Interest rates cut by 1 percentage point.
A five-year tax holiday for investments in power, plus other incentives.
Public funds for state-owned banks to provide for bad loans. Permission for
banks to raise funds on capital markets.
Increases in public investment in power, petroleum and natural gas.
Increases in spending on agricultural development, education and
infrastructure.
Cuts in domestic excise duties expected to reduce prices of consumer goods
including cars, television sets, refrigerators, cosmetics and biscuits.
No change in basic income or corporation taxes.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Singh unveils reform package
</HEADLINE>

   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA at the weekend unveiled a wide-ranging package of reforms designed to
integrate the country further into the global economy, including full
flotation of the rupee on foreign exchange markets.
Mr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, who announced the measures on
Saturday during his annual budget speech, also signalled an end to the tough
economic squeeze which he put in place in July 1991, and the start of a
strong push for export-led growth.
The budget was widely seen as a determined effort by the government to put
the economy back at the centre of the national agenda - and push aside the
inter-religious passions raised by the destruction of the Ayodhya mosque in
December. Mr Singh said India could not afford to spend time 'appearing to
be absorbed with obscurantist preoccupations and sectarian divides'.
The budget was also portrayed as an attempt by the ruling Congress (I) to
recover votes lost through the government's poor handling of the Ayodhya
crisis.
The right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Party, whose supporters stormed the
mosque, condemned it as 'as an electoral lozenge.'
Mr Singh cut interest rates by 1 percentage point - from 18 per cent to 17
per cent for commercial borrowers - slashed import duties, cutting the
maximum rate of duty from 110 per cent to 85 per cent, and reduced excise
taxes.
He announced tax breaks for investors in key sectors such as power, where
India suffers chronic shortages and introduced plans for further financial
reforms, including a scheme to use public funds to help state-owned banks
provide for long-standing bad debts.
The finance minister also greatly increased spending on education,
agricultural development and infrastructure. These rises will soften the
impact in rural areas of planned further cuts in fuel and fertiliser
subsidies.
To the surprise of many economists, Mr Singh both cut revenue sources and
increased public spending without raising government borrowing.
Finance ministry officials explained he could do this because the severity
of previous tax increases created room for manoeuvre. The target for the
fiscal deficit for the year 1993-94, starting April 1, is to be 4.5 per cent
of GDP, down from just over 5 per cent this year.
This is slightly above the 4 per cent target favoured by the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, which are monitoring India's reform programme
 -but close enough to allow them to continue supporting Mr Singh and his
policies.
Mr Singh said his budget would promote growth and boost exports massively
and denied it was inflationary. The government expects GDP growth to rise
from a likely 4 per cent this year to 5-5.5 per cent. Inflation is expected
to fall from 7 per cent now to 5-6 per cent. Foreign investment, of which
Dollars 2.3bn has been approved since the reforms began, is expected to grow
further.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Thailand expects budget deficit

<TEXT>
THAILAND'S Bt560bn (Pounds 15.17bn) budget for fiscal 1993, which predicts a
budget deficit for the first time in four years, was passed by the House of
Representatives in Bangkok at the weekend.
The bill was approved on Saturday after hours of squabbling between members
of parliament over such issues as the budget money that Thai MPs are
authorised to spend on projects in their own constituencies. The appointed
Senate is expected to endorse the budget this week.
Revenue is estimated at Bt534.4bn. Officials of the budget bureau defended
the deficit, amounting to Bt25.6bn or about 0.9 per cent of gross domestic
project, on the grounds that additional funds were needed for investment in
roads and other infrastructure. Mr Chuan Leekpai, the Democrat prime
minister, has promised to develop rural areas.
It is possible that the projected deficit will in any case never
materialise. Last year the budget was balanced, but the government ended up
with higher revenues and lower spending than expected, leaving a surplus of
Bt52.3bn, or about 2 per cent of GDP.
This year's budget, covering the fiscal year from October 1992, is six
months late because of the political upheaval in the country last year. Gen
Suchinda Kraprayoon was removed from the premiership after 50 pro-democracy
demonstrators were shot dead by soldiers in Bangkok in May, and an interim
government ran the country until the September elections which brought Mr
Chuan to power.
Economists have mixed views on the budget. Proponents of higher spending
point out that the treasury is now sitting on an accumulated surplus of
Bt220bn and that expenditure for the first half of this year has already
been held at last year's levels by the delay in preparing the budget.

TWO US human rights groups yesterday charged Indian security forces,
fighting against insurgents in the mountain state of Kashmir, with stepping
up a 'campaign of terror against civilians,' writes Stefan Wagstyl.
The report, from Asia Watch and Physicians for Human Rights, comes at a time
of interational concern about the ferocity of the struggle between the
Indian security forces and the militant groups.
In the most serious incident, 65 civilians were killed in the city of Sopore
in January when security forces staged an attack, after a militant assault
in which two soldiers died.
The human rights report documents alleged cases of torture, detention
without trial and assaults by members of the security forces on civilians.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Brazilian ultimatum on inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL's President Itamar Franco has issued an ultimatum to his economy
minister to bring down inflation within the next three months.
In a interview at the weekend, Mr Franco hit out at remarks by Mr Paulo
Haddad, the economy minister, that inflation would remain at current levels
for the next three months.
Alarmed at the latest inflation figures which show no respite from the 30
per cent-a-month level, Mr Franco said 'the people cannot tolerate more of
this inflation'. Accusing Mr Haddad of 'giving a shock to the population,'
he warned 'what brings down economy ministers is not presidents but
inflation'.
With no clear economic policy in force and inflation spiralling, expectation
is growing that Mr Franco will resort to a shock plan and price freeze,
something Mr Haddad has repeatedly ruled out. Mr Haddad says he is working
on a stabilisation programme which cannot be implemented until late April as
it requires structural changes to be made.
But Mr Franco said yesterday: 'The public is fed up of hearing only that
there won't be a new shock plan.' Although he stressed he had no intention
of imposing price controls 'for the time being,' he said he was unsure
whether inflation could be reduced without measures such as a freeze.
Mr Franco's comments heightened speculation over the future of Mr Haddad,
Brazil's fourth economy minister in three years.
In the past few weeks the president has publicly criticised his minister and
refused to authorise his request to devalue the cruzeiro, which is now
selling at 21,000 to the dollar.
The tension between the two men comes just as a mission from the
International Monetary Fund is due to arrive in Brazil. The mission,
arriving today, is to evaluate the economic situation as a preliminary to
full negotiations on a new accord.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Minister presses for the release of rainforest cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S environment minister, Mr Coutinho Jorge, arrived in London at the
weekend to lobby for release of long-promised funds from the G7 leading
industrialised nations for an ambitious plan to preserve the Amazon
rainforest.
The Amazon Pilot Project agreed at the G7 summit in London in 1990 was
heralded as the world's largest environment project and the first time that
first and third world nations had co-operated on a big environmental
programme.
Backed by the World Bank and European Community, the project envisaged
spending Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 1.05bn) over five years to protect the
world's largest rainforest. But the Amazon has been pushed down the
international agenda by more pressing matters and, three years on, Brazil
still has not got a cent.
Mr Miguel Oliveira, spokesman for Mr Jorge, said: 'The first world has got
all the publicity for the initiative while avoiding giving anything. The
rest of the world may have forgotten the Amazon but Brazil has not.'
Last year, President Fernando Collor secured a pledge to liberate Dollars
50m before the Earth Summit hosted in Rio. But the matter was quickly buried
amid his unsuccessful struggle to survive impeachment, and according to the
Environment Ministry the money was never released.
The new government secured a promise that an initial Dollars 128m tranche
would be released in April. But this is threatened by intense lobbying from
environmental groups on the US and UK governments to block the funds in
retaliation for Brazil's failure to recapture the escaped killers of Chico
Mendes, the rubber-tapper who brought the rainforest plight to world
attention. Ecologists say the Brazilian government made no effort to keep
the assassins in jail despite repeated warnings an escape was planned.
Mr Jorge will meet this week with non-governmental organisations such as
Friends of the Earth, academics, MPs and government ministers including Mr
Michael Heseltine, Mr Michael Howard and Mr Tristan Garel-Jones to try to
prevent the blockage of funds.
Mr Oliveira said yesterday: 'The Pilot Project is to further the aims that
Chico Mendes died for. Blocking the money would harm these objectives, not
help them.'

FT  01 MAR 93 / Surge in Mexican trade deficit worries investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MEXICO'S trade deficit climbed to Dollars 20.6bn (Pounds 14.5bn) last year,
an 85 per cent increase over 1991. The shortfall was Dollars 15.8bn when
revenues from in-bond plants were included.
The trade deficit, which has increased five-fold since 1990, represents more
than 6 per cent of gross domestic product and has become a growing source of
worry for investors in Mexico's money and stock markets.
The December deficit climbed to Dollars 2.2bn, the largest monthly shortfall
last year. Exports rose to Dollars 2.3bn, a 4.4 increase over December 1991,
while imports were Dollars 4.5bn, a 26 per cent increase. The growth in
imports appears to have levelled off at 25-26 per cent, although as yet
there is no sign of them slowing.
The government is easily financing the deficit, but at the cost of an annual
real interest rate of about 10 per cent. The Finance Ministry has long
argued that the growth in imports reflects restructuring of Mexican
industry, with companies importing capital and intermediate goods to improve
productivity and to compete better with international competition.
Exports have also suffered from the weakness in the US and international
economy, and the steady real appreciation of the peso against the dollar.
While the Mexican peso devalued by about 3 per cent against the dollar last
year, Mexican inflation was some 9 percentage points higher than the US's.
For the year as a whole, exports reached 27.5bn, 1.5 per cent more than
1991.
Manufacturing exports performed slightly better, rising by 4.2 per cent.
The Finance Ministry said export growth was 'satisfactory'. Imports
increased to Dollars 48.1bn last year, 26 per cent more than in 1991.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Lamont confident of British growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN will show faster growth this year than the European economy as a
whole, according to Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor.
In confident mood after chairing the Group of Seven talks in London, Mr
Lamont told a press conference he was encouraged by signs of an upturn in
Britain, even though UK unemployment would 'continue to rise for some time'.
Mr Lamont noted a 'disquieting' deterioration in economic conditions among
other European nations, much of it linked to the slowdown in Germany. This
was leading to a 'serious situation' for growth prospects across mainland
Europe.
In a robust rebuttal of speculation that he might lose his job in a cabinet
reshuffle after this month's UK budget, Mr Lamont said he was looking
forward to being in the British delegation at the annual world economic
summit in Tokyo in July. 'See you there,' he told reporters.
Asked about the high level of German interest rates, the chancellor said:
'When the Germans feel able to reduce their interest rates this will bring
considerable benefits (to the rest of Europe).' But he said the G7 meeting
had not discussed the timing of any such move.
Hinting that he might decide in the March 16 budget to put up taxes to
reduce the growing public-sector deficit, Mr Lamont said that, at the end of
the day, governments had to decide on economic policies with regard to their
long-term fiscal positions. That was even though the gap between state
spending and revenues tended naturally to rise during recessions, such as
the one Britain has suffered since about mid-1990.
Mr Lamont indicated he was cautiously optimistic about the possibility of a
UK recovery, noting rising retail sales volumes and the latest modestly
bullish survey of output expectations among manufacturers published last
week by the Confederation of British Industry. He said that, on current
economic evidence, UK bank base rates at 6 per cent were 'at the appropriate
level' after cuts of 4 percentage points since September.
Although he was concerned at the high level of UK unemployment, which in
January pushed through 3m for the first time in six years, loss of jobs in
Britain 'could not be isolated' from similar trends in other developed
countries. The 'only answer' to high unemployment was to 'get back on track'
for steady non-inflationary growth.
'There are no easy solutions; if there were we would be implementing them
already.'

FT  01 MAR 93 / G7 finance ministers rediscover harmony: Weekend meeting was
free of quarrels but it is too soon to signal a revival in the group's
fortunes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY came to rebuild international economic co-operation. When they left
London after five hours of informal talks on Saturday, the finance ministers
from the Group of Seven countries were congratulating themselves on a
successful meeting free of quarrels.
But it remains to be seen whether the brief meeting of ministers and central
bank governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and
Canada will revive the G7 after two years in which its gatherings have been
marked more often by bickering than agreement.
Saturday's meeting was not intended to decide any blueprints or set up
mechanisms to help the industrialised world deal with the problems of high
and rising unemployment, recession and slowing growth in continental Europe
and Japan, or the economic crisis in Russia.
There was no appetite for returning to the tightly co-ordinated policies of
the 1980s when the G7 tried to limit exchange rate fluctuations among its
members or set domestic economic policy objectives for members of the group
that were rarely adhered to.
Instead, the G7 countries will continue to frame their policies very much
with their own interests in mind, according to the 'Sinatra Doctrine' of
'doing it my way'.
But there was much talk of a 'positive spirit' after the meeting. The hope
is the gathering will have enabled the ministers to exchange views frankly
and gain a better insight into each other's economic problems and domestic
political constraints.
'It doesn't mean that we have to have identical economic policies for our
countries,' said a senior US Treasury official. 'But it does mean that each
will be concerned as to how our policies contribute to sustained growth
without inflation.'
The decision not to issue a communique or take decisions helped Saturday's
talks to run smoothly. There was no repetition of last April's G7 meeting in
Washington when Japanese objections to one sentence of the final text
prolonged the meeting for an acrimonious two hours.
But the absence of a communique could allow differences among nations to
persist. Although the ministers went out of their way to avoid megaphone
diplomacy and deliberately refrained from putting partner countries under
pressure for specific policy commitments, there were signs of strain beneath
the surface on Saturday.
A senior US Treasury official said after the talks that Washington would
like Japan to go beyond present plans for stimulating its economy by fiscal
means. That sentiment was echoed by Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance
minister, and other European G7 representatives. However, Mr Yoshiro
Hayashi, Japan's finance minister, said he had no intention of introducing
another package besides the existing budget that is being debated in the
Japanese parliament.
The US, Britain and France made clear they would like to see further cuts in
Germany's short-term interest rates but were given no assurances by the
German delegation. Mr Piero Barucci, the Italian finance minister, said that
all his G7 colleagues had told him they thought the lira was undervalued.
These tensions did not flare up into open dispute as the ministers were
determined to be on their best behaviour and because Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the
new US Treasury secretary, chose to adopt a softly-softly approach to
America's allies.
With compliments flowing in from all sides for the US administration's
deficit-reduction package and strong approval from other G7 countries for
President Bill Clinton's pledge on Friday to support the multilateral
trading system, Mr Bentsen decided to treat the meeting genuinely as a 'get
to know you' session.
He seems willing to wait a few months for any improved spirit of
international co-operation to yield results. The senior Treasury official
said the US hoped to see some positive fruits of co-operation by July's G7
summit in Tokyo, rather than the next G7 finance ministers' meeting in
April.
It also remains unclear how far the G7 countries will set up an
institutional framework to promote co-operation. Mr Bentsen, who has been
making the running in pushing for a revived G7, appeared to have no plan on
offer. His one suggestion, endorsed by the other countries, was that there
should be fewer communiques and that they should be brief when issued.
Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, appeared to be the only
minister with concrete plans to strengthen the G7 structure. Like Mr
Bentsen, he said communiques should be shorter and not necessarily issued
after every meeting. He also called for:
the G7 to meet four times a year;
the managing director of the International Monetary Fund to be more deeply
involved when the group has its periodic 'mutual surveillance' discussions;
and
the IMF to submit carefully focused papers about the world economy to help
the group's discussions.
Mr Waigel also suggested that trade and economics ministers should join one
of the finance ministers' future meetings to discuss ways to promote the
Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks. His ideas and other suggestions
will be taken up by senior officials from the G7 countries.
By the time they report to their ministers it will be clearer whether the
positive atmosphere of London marked a revival in the group's fortunes or
was just part of President Clinton's political honeymoon.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Notebook: The lone Texan given group's star treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT would go to the head of a lesser mortal. But it is to be hoped that Mr
Lloyd Bentsen has been close enough to power for long enough to cope with
the plaudits heaped on him and the new US administration in the course of
Saturday's Group of Seven meeting.
After years in which the US has often appeared like a demanding cuckoo in
the nest of international economic co-operation, Mr Bentsen could do no
wrong. Arriving in London with the US deficit-reduction package in his
briefcase and President Bill Clinton's support for the Uruguay Round trade
negotiations in everyone's mind, the courtly 72-year-old Texan was given
star treatment by his peers.
The other G7 partners were unanimous in complimenting the US measures. 'It's
a more serious attempt than anyone might have expected,' said one fellow
finance minister of the deficit-cutting plan. 'I never thought they would do
so much.' Mr Bentsen himself acknowledged that his warm reception owed as
much to the Clinton package as any contribution he made in the talks.
But Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, had a cautionary tale just
in case the reflected glory was going to Mr Bentsen's head. He recalled that
Robert Anderson, a US Treasury secretary in the 1950s, always used to say
that a finance minister who was popular had failed in his job.
No problem there, countered Mr Bentsen; any Texan who raised energy taxes
was sure of unpopularity.
*****
The blunt refusal of Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, to
consider any further fiscal stimulus to revive the Japanese economy was
about the nearest the meeting came to sparking a quarrel among the G7.
Some observers speculated that the Japanese stand may have reflected
continued annoyance about Mr Bentsen's out-of-turn remarks that had prompted
a sharp rise in the yen's value against the dollar in the preceding week.
Others thought Mr Hayashi's refusal to budge could reflect internal
political tensions in Japan's Liberal Democratic party.
But some grumpiness would have been understandable, given the Japanese
delegation's punishing travel plans. They arrived in London on Saturday
morning after flying overnight from Tokyo, only to depart again almost
immediately after the meeting. The reason? Not so much workaholism as the
difficulties of getting the existing fiscal 1993 budget through parliament.
*****
Conspicuous by his absence at the end of the meeting was Mr Horst Kohler,
the German Finance Ministry state secretary and chief G7 fixer. He left the
meeting early to get back to Bonn for his 50th birthday celebrations.
*****
In keeping with the subdued mood of the meeting was the Denbies special
reserve wine selected for Saturday's lunch of the main participants.
Although the Riesling/Muller-Thurgau produced by Britain's biggest vineyard
is described by wine buffs as 'piquant' and 'exceptional', retailing at
Pounds 7.85 a bottle it is some way from being among the world's finest. Mr
Lamont seems to have got to hear about the wine after Surrey-based Denbies
presented a case to Mr John Major a year or so ago. Perhaps Threshers should
start promoting it.

FT  01 MAR 93 / German states agree on need for more Bonn cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   POTSDAM, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 16 federal states in Germany have agreed a common plan to finance the
soaring costs of unification by stating that central government must bear
the overwhelming burden, and taxes must go up by next year at the latest to
finance it.
A summit meeting of the 16 state premiers in Potsdam at the weekend reached
little agreement on where they can save more money, but clear agreement on
the need to wring more cash out of the central state exchequer.
The deal was immediately denounced by Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance
minister, as one which would cause an 'unjustifiable increase' in the German
federal government deficit, and make the central government 'incapable of
action'.
The states agreed that some form of tax increase would be needed before
1995, the first date from which Mr Waigel is prepared to consider such a
move. He said yesterday that tax rises could not be considered until growth
resumed in the German economy.
It means that there is still a wide gap to bridge between the central
government and the 16 states on how they will pay for an estimated DM110bn
(Pounds 46.5bn) in annual transfers to east Germany from 1995 onwards. Mr
Waigel said the states' plan would mean the central government would have to
pay 90 per cent of the total bill.
The 16 state premiers agreed they could only afford to shoulder a share of
the burden if the central government agreed to give them a much larger share
in its revenues from value added tax: they want 45 per cent of the total VAT
take in future, against 37 per cent at present, or an extra DM20bn.
They also agreed that the financial needs of the five 'new' federal states
of east Germany would amount to at least DM60bn from 1995, if they were to
carry out their normal functions, including the financing of education,
housing, and police forces.
There was little agreement about the precise size of the transfers needed in
1995. The western states proposed DM60bn, while the eastern states said
between DM75bn and DM80bn.
In addition to the DM60bn, the central government estimates that a further
DM40bn is required to pay the debt service costs of inherited east German
debts from 1995, and DM10bn for costs of supporting east German industry,
and making subsidy payments to the poorest western states.
The state premiers discussed several proposals for savings, including the
abolition of the 13th school year in the German school system, and a rise in
the public sector working week.
In spite of the flimsy nature of the agreement, the state premiers
congratulated themselves on their apparent unanimity at talks.
The two-day conference opened on Friday in Potsdam, the capital of
Brandenburg.
Both Mr Kurt Biedenkopf, the premier of Saxony in east Germany, and Mr
Waigel stressed yesterday that the debate on financial burden-sharing went
to the heart of Germany's federal structure. But that was as far as their
agreement went.
Mr Waigel said he would present to the cabinet on Thursday the necessary
laws to put into effect the government's alternative plan for both savings
and tax increases. However, the two sides will meet on March 11, and both
insist they are prepared to consider compromises.

FT  01 MAR 93 / The European Market: Kindelbruck, a suitable case for
privatisation - A US luggage company go to Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kindelbruck's position in the middle of Germany has never been much of an
attraction in the past. But according to the management of York Luggage, a
New Jersey suitcase company, it was the principal reason for their presence
in this small town in Thuringia, late in January, partying on blood pudding,
raw pork and strong east German beer,
They were celebrating the end of a long search for a European manufacturing
base which had started before anyone contemplated the possibility of German
unification, and ended in the cast-offs department of the Treuhand
privatisation agency.
The Kofferfabrik Kindelbruck, founded in 1914, had been marked down for
liquidation. It was to become another casualty of unification. . . and
another warning that the town was fated never to enjoy the full fruits of
commercial success.
Kindelbruck's chronicles show that the industrial revolution simply passed
the place by. In 1873, for example, an appeal for a railway connection was
turned down. Two years later, the paper works, until then the town's most
enduring industrial establishment in 700 years of recorded history, was
closed. A shoe factory opened in 1888 and shut five years later after
another failed bid for a rail link.
Thanks to the new owner, York Luggage, Kindelbruck has kept its only
manufacturing company, which has withstood fire, war, communist neglect and
the ravages of the free market since it was founded in 1911. But the town
still has no railway, no canal or river link, just a ropey two-lane road
passing through. The nearest hotel still has no effective telephone system.
But Mr Frank Alfieri, York's chairman and chief strategist, does not care.
As well as being in the geographical centre of Germany - itself the biggest
market for luggage in Europe - the town sits in the middle of a new European
market of boundless potential, he says. It is home to a workforce
experienced in sticking and stitching suitcases. Unusually, the company also
has an established customer base among department and speciality store
buyers in western Germany, which was in place before the collapse of eastern
European markets which formerly bought 1.5m cases a year.
Among the tangibles, the package bought from the Treuhand included nine
acres of land and 30-odd scruffy buildings redolent with the smell of drains
and fresh paint.
The price, as usual in Treuhand deals with private companies, is a secret.
The social cost, as usual, has been enormous. Of the 630 former employees,
who used to make 1.5m cases a year, only 78 remain. A handful being trained
to work leather and manufacture a new line in laptop computer
carriers-cum-briefcases will bring the total to 100 later this year.
For the medium term, York is committed to investing DM4.8m (Pounds 2.03m) in
the site. What returns this will yield in jobs and earnings rest with the
success of the company's bold, even curious, product strategy.
York is primarily a US luggage wholesaler which gave up domestic manufacture
more than 10 years ago, shifting off-shore to the far east. In north America
it markets retailers' own-label product and brands such as Bill Blass, Diane
von Furstenburg and Members Only with an up-market but distinctly regional
cachet.
In Europe, where established labels such as Samsonite and Delsey dominate
the middle market and the likes of Louis Vuitton skim the cream, the New
Jersey newcomer plans to start in the crowded lower reaches. (The 'Wartburg'
line in its current product series, bearing the same name as the defunct
East German car, gives a clue to its ambitions at this level). But the
company also plans to ship products from Germany to the US and import its
American ranges into Kindelbruck for distribution in Europe.
In addition, Mr Alfieri says, it is trying to win licences to manufacture
sports bags under the Reebok, Adidas or Nike labels, and studying the
prospects for a grander design. 'What succeeded in the US with designer
names may be possible in Europe,' he adds. Most challenging, however, is a
project to establish the York name in the mid-range as a new brand in its
own right.
Tall orders for a new management which expects just DM10m sales this year
and has to ride a recession into the bargain. The key, says Mr Alfieri, is
that although consumers are not yet aware of the York name, it is well
respected among retailers. Since distribution channels are already
established, the company believes its main task is to ship suitable products
down them.
Meanwhile, export trade has already started with Switzerland, Austria,
France and the Netherlands. Nor is the local market being neglected. While
the band played and the beer flowed in the front office, cash was flowing in
through the back door where a chalked sign tempted passers-by: 'Special
offer, suitcases DM7 to DM35'.

FT  01 MAR 93 / 'Crash landing' predicted for W German economy: Deutsche
Bank economist criticises 'inappropriate' Bonn policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE western German economy is heading for a crash landing, dragged down by
tumbling industrial production, high unemployment, and 'inappropriate'
policy responses in Bonn, according to Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at
Deutsche Bank.
Gross domestic product in the west will fall by up to 2 per cent this year
and numbers without work will rise by a further 500,000, he told the
Financial Times.
Another 100,000 will lose their jobs in the east, pushing the unadjusted
pan-German total above 4m next January. By then some 1.5m people - an
increase of 400,000 on latest levels - will be working short time, he added.
He predicted unemployment would remain at around 4m during 1994, and
downgraded his forecast for economic growth next year from 3 to 2 per cent.
Fearing political paralysis due to federal and state elections starting in
February next year, he said: 'It is difficult to see when anyone in politics
will have the chance to think and act. I have never yet seen any major
policy changes in an election year.'
He was confident of further cuts by the Bundesbank in leading interest
rates, and said he was assuming the Lombard and discount rates would each
fall 200 basis points to 7 per cent and 6 per cent respectively by the end
of the year.
However, rate cuts alone could not bring recovery. In the short term, only
exports - mainly to north America and south east Asia, which account for 20
per cent of overseas sales - could help bring relief.
Mr Walter's forecasts represent an almost complete reversal of his stance in
a matter of weeks. From being one of the most optimistic commentators, he
has switched to being one of the most pessimistic.
In an article written for the FT in early January he predicted nil economic
growth and 3.25m unemployment during 1993. He later adjusted his growth
forecast to minus 1 per cent, in line with government expectations.
'We are heading into a deeper trough than we had assumed,' he explained,
'and the economic policy reaction has been too small to correct the
imbalances.'
While there had been some surprising positive developments, including wage
settlements around or below the expected rate of inflation and the
Bundesbank's recent interest rate cuts, their benefits had been obliterated
by further worsening of domestic and external conditions.
The government's proposed solidarity package, comprising mainly tax
increases, was an 'almost completely inappropriate' response under
conditions which called for public spending cuts, privatisation of state
assets and an increase in the retirement age, he said.
Mr Walter enjoys privileged observer status in Germany's biggest private
bank, which has intimate links with the country's top companies. He said
business and consumer confidence was 'crashing'.
Apart from the effects of the cyclical downturn, western Germany faced
structural deterioration with de-industrialisation, nil foreign investment
and 'an extended period of increased unemployment'.
Despite his gloom, he said he could not imagine that the people, politicians
and business community would not react this year. Union restraint on pay,
which has led to deals of 3-4 per cent this year, showed labour leaders had
reacted more rationally than politicians.
Mr Walter said he had a faint hope that Germany would 'fight back' if the
failings of Europe's 'model' economy threatened the national reputation with
international ridicule.
However, he added, next year's elections loomed as 'a deadly threat to my
hopes'.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Europe out to cut sulphur emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCES WILLIAMS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS begin today on setting new targets for reducing sulphur
emissions in Europe in a bid to tackle the continent's worst pollution
blackspots.
The week-long talks, under auspices of the United Nations Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE), will bring together over 30 countries from
western and eastern Europe.
They will be trying to advance negotiations on a new sulphur emissions
protocol to the ECE's convention on long-range transboundary air pollution.
The current protocol, signed in 1985, set a 30 per cent emissions reduction
target between 1980 and 1993.
Sulphur emissions, which contribute to acid rain, a major cause of forest
death and building erosion, come mainly from fossil-fuelled power-stations.
The emissions can drift over long distances; much of Scandinavia's sulphur
deposits comes from power stations in eastern Europe.
ECE officials say European nations have already agreed in principle on, at
minimum, an overall emissions standstill from present levels, but are not
planning to set another across-the-board reduction target. Instead, the
talks are focused on reducing pollution above 'critical load' - the
threshold of ecological tolerance.
Surveys suggest that more than a third of Europe's ecosystems are suffering
sulphur deposition above the 'critical load,' notably in the 'black
triangle' linking the Czech Republic, Poland and eastern Germany and in
Scandinavia.
Negotiators will also be considering technology required to cut pollution to
'critical load' levels and how to share the substantial cost burden.
The countries most responsible for high sulphur emissions, mostly in eastern
Europe, are those least able to pay. ECE officials say that, although
violating the 'polluter pays' principle, it makes sense for rich countries
importing pollution from poor ones to pay part of the cost of reducing it.
The current sulphur protocol has 20 members. Neither Britain nor the US,
both heavy polluters, has signed.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Bosnia aid plan 'a risk worth taking': Three cargo aircraft
leave Frankfurt on presumed start of air-drops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, yesterday played down the
risks to US air crews as the air-drop of relief supplies for Bosnia was
reported to have got under way. He said the operations were 'a risk well
worth taking' and probably involved less danger than existing relief flights
into Sarajevo airport.
German television reported last night that cargo aircraft had left Frankfurt
airbase to make the first air-drops of crates of food and medicines to
villagers stranded by fighting in remote parts of Bosnia.
The ZDF television channel said three C-130 transport aircraft had left on
the mission and it showed one of the aircraft taking off from the military
base at Frankfurt airport.
But the US military, which has put a news blackout on the flights, declined
to confirm or deny that any aircraft had left the base.
Mr Christopher claimed the fact that ground convoys were currently getting
through in Bosnia with less trouble might well reflect the imminence of the
US airdrops. 'It is a statement of greater US involvement,' he said.
Speaking in a TV interview, Mr Christopher said the weekend dropping of
leaflets telling people of the impending operation had been 'successful and
routine'.
He also sought to play down domestic criticism that the US was being drawn
into a Balkan quagmire. Citing the number of missed opportunities in the
last 18 months to control the conflict, he argued that now 'the great risk
is that we do nothing'. He noted the dangers of a wider Balkan conflict and
added: 'We have a stake in preventing the world from going up in flames.'
Mr Christopher also firmly rejected the notion that the countries of Europe
were not doing enough to help.
'There is a division of labour and responsibility,' he said, noting the
presence of British, French, Spanish and Canadian troops in Bosnia and the
use of Nato surveillance aircraft.
In advance of the air-drops, two Hercules C-130 cargo aircraft on Saturday
scattered boxes containing 1m leaflets over eastern Bosnia - written in
Serbo-Croat in both Cyrillic and Latin script, and emblazoned with the US
flag - urging people not to open fire on the aircraft and to stay clear of
the falling crates.
But first reports by ham radio from Gorazde, a besieged town in eastern
Bosnia, said the leaflets had missed their mark. Mr Hadzo Effendic, the
mayor, said no leaflets had dropped in Gorazde, Radio Zagreb reported. The
radio quoted Mr Effendic as saying some leaflets had fallen in no-man's land
between the frontlines. He said Srebrenica and Zepa, two of a handful of
Bosnian government strongolds in eastern Bosnia, had not found any leaflets.
United Nations officials and representatives of Bosnia's three main ethnic
groups have already inspected the first 96 crates being delivered in the
first air-drop. Serb leaders have expressed suspicions that weapons will be
included in the air-drops.
Weighing 704kg each, the parcels include ready-to-eat meals. Smaller crates
have medical supplies, including non-prescription medicines for people
suffering shortages of anaesthetics and antibiotics.
Meanwhile, a fresh row flared between Moslem-led Bosnian government troops
and Bosnian Croats, nominal allies in the civil war, when Bosnian Croat
forces announced that they were closing all supply routes between Croatia
and Moslem-held territory.
The Croatian Defence Council (HVO) accused the Bosnian government forces of
deploying 25,000 troops in central Bosnia and abandoning the fighting
against Serb forces.
But Croatian television reported later that the HVO had agreed to let
through Bosnian army convoys at border points if they were destined for
regions where HVO and Moslem forces were jointly fighting the Serbs.

Mr Michel Sapin, French finance minister, yesterday attacked Britain's
social policy, saying it was starting to think like a third world country,
Reuter reports from Paris.
His comments were in response to British Prime Minister John Major's
dismissal of French charges that Britain was luring foreign investment by
maintaining low pay and conditions.
'Let's compare ourselves to what is good - Germany,' Mr Sapin said in a
debate on unemployment on French television. 'But certainly not to Mr Major
or England, which is beginning to reason like countries of the third world.'

FT  01 MAR 93 / France bucks trend as foreign investment rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN DIRECT investment in France grew strongly in the first six months of
last year, making France the exception among member countries of the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, which generally
experienced a slowdown in direct investment inflows.
According to an OECD survey of financial market trends, strong inflows meant
that foreign direct investment exceeded French investment abroad for the
first time.
The OECD suggested the growth reflected a more favourable attitude to
foreign investment in France because of the employment opportunities it
generated, and the realisation by foreign investors that France was at the
heart of the single market.
Figures for the first six months of last year confirm the generally downward
trend in FDI, with the OECD reporting that Japanese direct investment abroad
fell by about 16 per cent from the same period in 1991.
In the first six months of last year total direct investment inflows in OECD
countries was Dollars 32.4bn (Pounds 22.8bn), compared with Dollars 36.6bn
in the first six months of 1991. Outflows fell from Dollars 73.6bn in the
first half of 1991 to Dollars 67.9bn in the same period last year.
Among the biggest investors, only outflows from the US registered
'remarkable' growth in the first half of last year.
Chemicals were the main target of European and US direct investment in the
manufacturing sector abroad. The report found that in 1991, US investment in
foreign chemical industries was Dollars 40bn, representing 10 per cent of
total US companies' assets abroad. By contrast only a few Japanese chemical
groups operate globally. In Europe, chemicals constituted the bulk of
German, British, French and Dutch investment abroad. A new impetus came from
privatisation in east European countries where European groups took over big
producers in Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
The EC received more than half US outward investment in electronics in 1991,
with new US affiliates set up mainly in Germany and the UK.
The report says that over the past three years, Japanese investment in car
manufacturing came to a standstill in the US as demand for cars weakened in
North America and Europe. At the same time, Japanese investment in the
European car industry - mainly Spain and the UK - doubled.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Italians ponder Craxi immunity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian parliament this week confronts the sensitive issue of whether to
waive parliamentary immunity for Mr Bettino Craxi, who was forced to step
down from Socialist party leadership because of his alleged involvement in
the Milan corruption scandal.
Although more than 50 deputies and senators are caught up in a series of
corruption scandals, Mr Craxi is the most senior member of the politial
establishment to be wanted for questioning.
The debate, scheduled for tomorrow, will reveal the extent to which
parliament has the will to act quickly and tackle the increasingly complex
issues raised by the nationwide investigations into political corruption. Mr
Craxi is expected to use the occasion to underline the difficulties and
dangers of putting the political system on trial.
The outcome is likely to have an impact on moves to find a legislative
solution to limit the scope of the corruption investigations and prevent
matters getting out of hand. Already the scandals have reached deep into
Italy's business and political elite and more developments are expected this
week.
The current areas of investigation centre on commissions paid to political
parties for contracts in the power industry; reorganisation of the chemical
industry in the 80s; the role of ENI, the state oil concern; the state
road-building authority, Anas; EC funds for professional training improperly
used; and spending for the 1990 world cup football competition
In documents submitted to parliament, Milan magistrates have listed 40
incidents of alleged corruption and receiving illicit finance for the
Socialist Party worth L36bn (Pounds 15.7m).
Mr Craxi, who quit the leadership on February 16, has consistently denied
wrong-doing and has claimed the magistrates are conducting a vendetta
against him and the political establishment. His main defence rests on the
argument that he ran the political/policy side of the party, with
administration and finance left to others.
But even if Mr Craxi convinces parliament on this point, deputies face the
awkward question of the degree of responsibility a party leader has for what
goes on in his party - and whether this is sufficient grounds to waive
immunity.
The pressure on Mr Craxi has mounted since Ms Enza Tomaselli, his private
secretary, was arrested on February 17 and held under preventive detention.
The tactic, used by magistrates to make people talk, has been much
criticised.
The first senior Socialist to have immunity waived was Mr Gianni de
Michelis, former foreign minister. On Friday he was questioned for the first
time by magistrates regarding alleged illicit party finance over a Venice
public works contract.
When he left the justice building, Mr de Michelis was chased by a hostile
crowd.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Spanish in bid to raise question of Gibraltar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Javier Solana, the Spanish foreign minister, yesterday reiterated Spain's
commitment to ending the UK's colonial presence in Gibraltar.
Speaking in the eve of a meeting with Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, Mr Solana cautioned that little progress towards solving the
Gibraltar dispute could be expected from the one-day talks. Spain would use
'persuasion and pressure in appropriate doses' to end the 'anachronism' that
Gibraltar represented.
The most obvious pressure exerted by the Spanish authorities consists of
rigorous customs checks on vehicles entering and leaving the colony which
can lead to queues of up to three hours.
At a diplomatic level Spain has prevented the implementation of the EC's
External Frontiers Convention which lays down the borders of the Single
Market because it refuses to accept Gibraltar under its present colonial
status as a valid Community entry point.
Mr Hurd could, however, be pressed to review proposals tabled by Spain in
1985, which suggested a leaseback formula or power sharing.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Allies still sceptical about US air-drop: The need to find a
balance between effectiveness and risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSULTATIONS and careful preparations for the US air-drop in eastern Bosnia
have failed to disperse scepticism about the operation among Washington's
allies and UN forces on the ground.
Officers with UN forces in Bosnia, frustrated at their own inability to get
relief supplies through to some of the communities most in need, say it will
be difficult to achieve a balance between effectiveness and risk. Military
experts believe an operation of this kind can in any case be no more than a
temporary measure.
The drops by four-engined C-130 Hercules aircraft are expected to made from
anywhere between 5,000 and 15,000 feet, avoiding risks from small-arms fire
and some kinds of anti-aircraft artillery. But although special parachutes
designed for high-velocity drops will be used, accuracy cannot be assured.
The bundles, containing up to 700kg of food and medicine, may land in the
wrong area or cause casualties or damage in the intended zone. Leaflets
dropped over the weekend warned people to wait until the containers have
landed. Unlike most operations of this type, there will be no logistics
troops on the ground to receive the supplies, organise distribution and
recover equipment.
Some of the apprehensions about the dangers of the operation - and the
possibility, as Serb leaders warned, that it would lead to an escalation in
the conflict - have been lessened by its reduced scale.
Initial discussion of the plan, launched last month at a time when the UN
High Commissioner for Refugues had suspended current aid supplies in Bosnia,
pointed to an operation of greater dimensions and a more overtly military
nature.
However, although the US transport aircraft flying from Germany are now due
to carry out the drops without cover from carrier-based fighters, there is
concern about possible US military reaction if the C-130s come under attack.
The danger is similar to that facing the aircraft ferrying relief to
Sarajevo. A two-engined Italian G222 transport aircraft was shot down near
the Bosnian capital last September, killing all four crew, and other
aircraft have been hit by small-calibre weapons.
The threat is seen as coming not only from uncontrolled Serb forces, who may
not be satisfied by assurances that the supplies do not contain arms, but
also from Moslem militiamen seeking to bring the US and its allies directly
into the conflict. Many Bosnian Moslems and Croats criticise the aid effort
for attempting to deal with the symptoms rather than the cause of suffering.
UN forces are worried that if the US is provoked into using air power they
will be exposed to direct attack. They have only limited means for defending
themselves. The British army has some light artillery and locating radars
waiting in reserve aboard a navy task force in the Adriatic. French forces
have already moved in Mistral missiles to defend their positions in
northwest Bosnia against air attack.
Any escalation involving UN forces would threaten the running of aid convoys
by land, which are the only practical means of providing the large volumes
required,
The US operation also raises questions about command arrangements for any
future international action in former Yugoslavia. Like the warships
monitoring shipping in the Adriatic, the air-drop operation is on UN
authority but not directly under UN command. US military commanders favour a
similar arrangement for any future US-Nato peacekeeping force.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Bundesbank hints at rate decline: G7 meeting fails to ease
concern over unemployment and spreading recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S benchmark short-term interest rates are set to decline but the
fall will do little to assuage mounting concern about the European economy
among business leaders and finance ministers.
As politicians and company chiefs around Europe warn of rising unemployment
and spreading recession on the European continent, Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
the Bundesbank president, forecast a decline in German money market rates
which stand at 8.5 per cent.
Speaking after a meeting in London on Saturday of finance ministers from the
Group of Seven countries, Mr Schlesinger said that a reduction from today of
DM32bn (Pounds 13.5bn) in the minimum reserves which German banks have to
hold in non-interest bearing accounts at the Bundesbank should prompt a
slight fall in German money market interest rates.
Mr Schlesinger gave no hint about whether the Bundesbank might lower its
official discount and Lombard rates. The Bundesbank's decision-making
council will next meet on Thursday.
But his remarks indicated a more relaxed attitude to falling interest rates.
They were the nearest that anyone came to encouraging hope of more action to
revive the world economy at the meeting of ministers and central bank
governors from the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.
However, a decline in short-term rates is unlikely to be enough to prevent
economic slowdown and rising unemployment in Germany and other
industrialised nations. Hopes that the G7 might develop a common approach to
world economic problems by July's Tokyo world economic summit could not
conceal widespread gloom about the global economy and frustration in the US,
UK and France that Germany and Japan were not doing more to encourage
growth.
A Financial Times survey suggests that business leaders in continental
Europe are deeply gloomy about their prospects. Some liken conditions to the
first oil-shock of the early 1970s.
'Consumer confidence is in free fall,' says Mr David Herman, chairman of
Adam Opel, the German arm of General Motors.
Mr Jean-Rene Fourtou, chairman of Rhone-Poulenc, France's biggest chemicals
group, says: 'The state of the European economy is worse even than during
the 1973 oil-shock. I don't expect it to improve until 1994 at the
earliest.'
Mr Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, says the
western German economy is heading for a crash landing, dragged down by
tumbling industrial production, high unemployment and 'inappropriate'
government policies.
In an interview with the Financial Times today, he forecasts a fall of up to
2 per cent in west Germany's gross domestic product this year, bringing the
pan-German unemployment total to more than 4m by next January.
After the G7 meeting, Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, warned
that unemployment in Germany would rise this year by between 200,000 and
300,000.
Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, said the slowdown in Germany
was 'of particular concern' and warned of a need for 'deepened international
co-ordination' of economic policymaking. Both Mr Sapin and Mr Norman Lamont,
chancellor, said they would like to see German interest rates fall, but -
like other G7 participants - indicated they had not put pressure on the
Bundesbank to achieve this.
Participants unanimously praised President Bill Clinton's plan to cut the US
budget deficit and his support for the open world trading system, and agreed
that their informal meeting provided a good basis for further co-operation.
The ministers took no decisions, issued no communique and came to no special
conclusions on currencies.
Speaking after the meeting, a senior US Treasury official said he would like
to see Japan take steps to boost its economy through fiscal measures and 'a
further reduction' in German interest rates.
Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, said the high level of
unemployment in many developed nations was 'a grave issue'. But he said
Japan had 'no intention' of taking extra fiscal measures on top of a special
package agreed in August and existing budget plans.
Mr Lamont, who chaired the meeting, said he did not envisage cutting UK
interest rates at present.

Christopher Parkes in Frankfurt.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Plans to privatise Docklands railway expected shortly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government is about to announce that it is planning to privatise the
Docklands Light Railway, which links the City of London with Canary Wharf
and Stratford in east London.
The move is likely to reinforce suspicions that privatisation could extend
beyond British Rail to smaller urban systems such as London Underground and
the Tyne &amp; Wear Metro.
However, the Department of Transport said that privatising the Docklands
Light Railway would require separate legislation from the Railways Bill
currently going through parliament.
The move was foreshadowed in the Conservative party's general election
manifesto last year which said the government would seek to privatise the
Docklands Light Railway during the present parliament's lifetime.
Until recently the commitment had been considered to be lying dormant
because of the railway's unreliability and because the failure of the Canary
Wharf development meant it would carry far fewer passengers than expected.
However, the government is now about to appoint the management consultancy
arm of Ernst &amp; Young, the accountants, to draw up a list of options for
fulfilling the manifesto commitment.
If a stock market flotation or outright sale is chosen, the railway's new
owners will need continuing subsidies because the railway costs six times as
much to run as it collects in fares.
An alternative would be to privatise it in the same way as BR by inviting
the private sector to bid for a franchise to operate the railway. The
contract would go to the company requiring the lowest subsidy.
The Docklands Light Railway cost Pounds 77m to build. From its opening in
1987, its performance was disrupted by an Pounds 800m expansion programme to
cope with the increased demands that were expected to be created by the
Canary Wharf development.
One reason the government wants to press ahead with privatisation is because
of the need to fund a proposed Pounds 130m extension of the railway from the
southern tip of the Isle of Dogs to Lewisham in south-east London.
The government would like the extension to be privately funded, and the
simplest way to achieve that would be to have the line built by the
private-sector owner of the rest of the railway.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Lilley caps level of home loans benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CEILING is to be put on mortgage interest payments paid by the social
security system for the formerly well-off who have lost their jobs, Mr Peter
Lilley, the social security secretary, said yesterday.
The measure will mean that along with existing restrictions, only mortgages
of up to Pounds 150,000 will be eligible for social security help in 1993,
and this will be lowered to Pounds 125,000 in 1994, and reviewed again after
that.
The move, which will be implemented in the second half of April, follows
severe ministerial embarrassment last December over a case in which mortgage
interest payments of almost Pounds 2,000 a week were made to a former
insurance sales executive.
It coincides with a survey commissioned by the housing charity Shelter which
shows that 55 per cent of backbench MPs - spreadamong all parties - support
the phasing out of mortgage interest tax relief.
Mr Lilley said of the plan to cap social security help on home loan
interest: 'We want to focus support on those whose needs are greatest, not
on those whose assets are greatest. Why should the taxpayer keep the former
millionaire in his mansion?
'It is one thing to tide over ordinary mortgage payers hit by the double
blow of redundancy and a weak housing market. And we have no intention of
damaging the current recovery in the housing market.
'But the system was never intended to bail out the super-rich on
mega-mortgages who made no provision against tough times,' he added.
The government says about 1,500 people claim income support help with
mortgage interest on sums above Pounds 150,000, and 3,000 on sums above
Pounds 125,000. The new ceiling will not apply retrospectively.
Beyond solving a political difficulty, the move reflects a belief among
ministers that social security payments should increasingly be targeted at
those most in need, and that people should be encouraged to make provision
for themselves against risk.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour chairman of the cross-party social security
committee of MPs, said: 'We now have the worst of all possible worlds. This
will make the rich homeless - and I am against making the rich or the poor
homeless.'

FT  01 MAR 93 / Disruption after blast could cost New York billions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW YORK City faces multi-billion dollar losses as a result of the bomb that
rocked the World Trade Center on Friday, with the 110-storey twin towers
remaining closed to their thousands of office workers for at least a week.
But commodity exchanges will re-open for business today in their usual venue
in one of the smaller buildings of the complex.
The FBI confirmed that a bomb in an underground car park 'definitely' caused
the blast, but it was not known who planted it. Five people were killed and
more than 1,000 injured as the ceiling collapsed on to an underground train
station and as smoke billowed through the twin towers, the second highest
buildings in the world.
Mr Mario Cuomo, the New York state governor, said: 'The guess around the
world must be that this is terrorist-related,' adding: 'You have to prepare
for the worst.'
New York FBI chief James Fox said: 'It certainly could be anyone. A lot of
people have been laid off recently. It could be drug dealers upset with the
US government, could be terrorists, could be any one of those.'
The towers suffered no structural damage, but would be closed for 'in excess
of a week' for repairs, according to Mr Stanley Brezenoff, executive
director of the Port Authority, which operates the complex.
Some disruption is likely for all financial firms based in the complex. Some
of those unable to return to the twin towers today have sought temporary
premises or may route business through their offices in other cities.
Mr Brezenoff said the nine-story building that houses the commodity
exchanges, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, would re-open today.
'The exchanges asked for 3-4 hours a day, and they will get that and
possibly more,' he said.
There had earlier been concern that world oil trading might be affected by
any disruption to futures trading on Nymex.
Insurance analysts said the closure of the towers would be regarded by the
insurance industry as a 'catastrophic event'.
Some estimates suggest that the economic impact on the city, from lost
business, could run to more than Dollars 1bn a day.
Mr Raymond Kelly, New York City's Police Commissioner, said about 40 calls
had been logged claiming responsibility for the explosion, but declined to
discuss details.

FT  01 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: GEC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There are echoes of the 1980s about GEC. Recovery, when it arrives, will
once again challenge GEC's cash holdings, while the company faces new
management issues. Lord Weinstock has devolved responsibility for many of
the best hopes to joint ventures. Running the defence operations is the
management of long-term decline. Striking out in a radically new strategic
direction hardly fits with the company's careful culture.
That caution has done the company no harm with the market recently, despite
the fall in interest rates. In part that is because some of the company's
cash is held in French francs within GEC-Alsthom, and so has been insulated
from the fall in UK rates. But the yield premium on the shares has also
fallen as fund managers have revalued the company's financial strength and
ability to grow its dividends ahead of the market average. GEC now yields
only slightly more than the FT-A All-Share index but is still generating
cash and has a dividend cover of 1.9 times.
Operations, however, look less rosy. Defence is fighting for profits in a
declining market. The gradual run-down of the BT System X business also puts
the telecoms operations on the defensive. Only the GEC-Alsthom power systems
and transport joint venture offers the prospect of significant growth, but
that division contributed only 22 per cent of last year's profits. Perhaps
the company is holding its cash to force good terms from the government for
GEC investment in public projects, but that may come to nothing. And however
good the dividend record in the 1980s, Lord Weinstock's reluctance to spend
may be extended to shareholders if he believes lower dividend cover would
cramp his room for manoeuvre.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Airtours expected to raise bid for Owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRTOURS IS today expected to increase the terms of its hostile all-share
bid for rival holiday group, Owners Abroad, to 135p a share, 20p higher than
the market price at Friday's close. The new bid will value Owners Abroad at
about Pounds 270m, up from Pounds 225m.
The new terms are likely to involve Airtours raising its three-for-eight
share offer to 15 of its own shares for 24 Owners Abroad shares. Airtours is
not, however, expected to increase the partial cash alternative unless the
Owners Abroad board recommends the bid.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners Abroad chairman, and Mr David Crossland, Airtours
chairman, met last Wednesday - as did their advisers on Friday - but failed
to agree terms for a recommended bid.
Airtours is understood to believe its target is holding out for too high a
price. Owners Abroad's advisers say its rival has failed to appreciate the
value of the proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel agents and
financial services company controlled by the German state bank, Westdeutsche
Landesbank.
On Friday Owners Abroad posted its last defence document to shareholders.
This followed the decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry
secretary, not to refer Airtours' bid to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. Airtours must post its last document including any substantial
new information to Owners Abroad shareholders by this Friday.

FT  01 MAR 93 / Notebook: The lone Texan given group's star treatment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT would go to the head of a lesser mortal. But it is to be hoped that Mr
Lloyd Bentsen has been close enough to power for long enough to cope with
the plaudits heaped on him and the new US administration in the course of
Saturday's Group of Seven meeting.
After years in which the US has often appeared like a demanding cuckoo in
the nest of international economic co-operation, Mr Bentsen could do no
wrong. Arriving in London with the US deficit-reduction package in his
briefcase and President Bill Clinton's support for the Uruguay Round trade
negotiations in everyone's mind, the courtly 72-year-old Texan was given
star treatment by his peers.
The other G7 partners were unanimous in complimenting the US measures. 'It's
a more serious attempt than anyone might have expected,' said one fellow
finance minister of the deficit-cutting plan. 'I never thought they would do
so much.' Mr Bentsen himself acknowledged that his warm reception owed as
much to the Clinton package as any contribution he made in the talks.
But Mr Theo Waigel, the German finance minister, had a cautionary tale just
in case the reflected glory was going to Mr Bentsen's head. He recalled that
Robert Anderson, a US Treasury secretary in the 1950s, always used to say
that a finance minister who was popular had failed in his job.
No problem there, countered Mr Bentsen; any Texan who raised energy taxes
was sure of unpopularity.
*****
The blunt refusal of Mr Yoshiro Hayashi, the Japanese finance minister, to
consider any further fiscal stimulus to revive the Japanese economy was
about the nearest the meeting came to sparking a quarrel among the G7.
Some observers speculated that the Japanese stand may have reflected
continued annoyance about Mr Bentsen's out-of-turn remarks that had prompted
a sharp rise in the yen's value against the dollar in the preceding week.
Others thought Mr Hayashi's refusal to budge could reflect internal
political tensions in Japan's Liberal Democratic party.
But some grumpiness would have been understandable, given the Japanese
delegation's punishing travel plans. They arrived in London on Saturday
morning after flying overnight from Tokyo, only to depart again almost
immediately after the meeting. The reason? Not so much workaholism as the
difficulties of getting the existing fiscal 1993 budget through parliament.
*****
Conspicuous by his absence at the end of the meeting was Mr Horst Kohler,
the German Finance Ministry state secretary and chief G7 fixer. He left the
meeting early to get back to Bonn for his 50th birthday celebrations.
*****
In keeping with the subdued mood of the meeting was the Denbies special
reserve wine selected for Saturday's lunch of the main participants.
Although the Riesling/Muller-Thurgau produced by Britain's biggest vineyard
is described by wine buffs as 'piquant' and 'exceptional', retailing at
Pounds 7.85 a bottle it is some way from being among the world's finest. Mr
Lamont seems to have got to hear about the wine after Surrey-based Denbies
presented a case to Mr John Major a year or so ago. Perhaps Threshers should
start promoting it.

FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: UBS climbs 10.4% with trading
lift
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Switzerland, the country's largest, recorded a 10.4 per cent
rise in net income last year to SFr1.34bn (Dollars 883m), as sparkling
results from trading offset reverses in domestic lending.
'We can claim to be very happy,' Mr Robert Studer, the UBS chief executive,
said yesterday, adding that 'we feel quite optimistic about 1993'. He
forecast foreign operations would continue to flourish and the bank would
overcome its problems in Switzerland.
'All sectors have budgeted for increases in income this year,' Mr Studer
said.
Return on equity rose from 7 per cent in 1991 to 7.4 per cent last year and
the group was 'on track' to reach its target of 10 per cent by the
mid-1990s.
Foreign operations contributed about a third of group profit last year, up
from a quarter in 1991, and the bank, one of the few remaining to enjoy
triple A ratings from all leading credit rating agencies, benefited from a
large influx of demand and savings deposits.
Turmoil in foreign exchange markets in the second half of the year helped
trading income soar 32.2 per cent to SFr1.68bn.
Net interest income grew 3.6 per cent to SFr3.4bn thanks to improving
margins. But provisions for bad loans were raised 6.2 per cent to SFr1.8bn.
The directors are proposing to increase dividends from SFr27 to SFr29 per
bearer share and from SFr5.40 to SFr5.80 per registered share.
Bank Leu, part of the CS Holding group, has reported 1992 net profit of
SFr30.7m after liquidating SFr11.1m in hidden reserves, 7.2 per cent lower
than the 1991 result.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Salvation Army 'ignored investment advice'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS, ANDREW JACK and ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR EMPLOYEES of the Salvation Army believe the financial transactions
which led to an alleged Pounds 6.2m fraud were in breach of Charity
Commission guidelines drawn up after the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International scandal.
This view, held by bankers who have worked closely with the Salvation Army,
is shared by top charity lawyers in the City and the organisation's own
financial advisers.
The charity's lay investment specialists from top City institutions held
meetings with the organisation this week at which they repeated their
disapproval that their advice on how to invest the missing funds had been
ignored.
The concerns about a breach of the guidelines come after a week in which it
has become apparent that several of the individuals and organisations named
in a writ by the charity were already under investigation by police and
regulatory authorities in the UK and the US.
Detectives of the Metropolitan Police and City of London police Company
Fraud Squad will next week present the Crown Prosecution Service with a
preliminary report on the alleged fraud. This would be the first step
towards prosecutions. The Serious Fraud Office is also believed to be taking
an interest in the case.
Under the guidelines drawn up with the advice of the Bank of England and the
Building Societies Commission a charity should:
Draw up a list of recognised financial institutions which have a first-class
reputation . . . only institutions with the highest short-term ratings
should be considered.
Use professional money managers for substantial cash resources.
Recognise that, even if professional managers are appointed, the trustees
bear the responsibility for decision-making and should carefully and
objectively assess the advice they are being given.
The opinion was backed yesterday by Mr Andrew Crawford of City law firm
Cameron Markby Hewitt, which advises a number of charities on their
investment powers.
Mr Crawford said last night: 'This (case) demonstrates the importance of
observing the Charity Commission guidelines on investing cash, which
includes the need to seek proper professional advice.'
It also emerged last night that three top City investment specialists who
had advised the charity against the transaction raised the matter with the
Salvation Army again last October. They were disappointed to be told that
the deal had gone ahead without their knowledge.
The three advisers are Dr Kevin Carter, group investments director of
Providence Capital; Mr John Padovan, former deputy chairman of Barclays de
Zoete Wedd; and Mr John Renshaw, former deputy chairman of John Laing.
The Charity Commission said last night that it was monitoring the progress
of the internal investigation being carried out by the trustees of the
Salvation Army, but would 'keep under review' whether there was a need to
intervene more directly.
Detectives plan to interview Salvation Army officers including Colonel
Grenville Burn, an officer in charge of fundraising, and Colonel Ivor Rich,
the secretary in charge of business administration at the army's London
headquarters.
Col Burn was yesterday officially 'on sick leave' and was not available for
comment. Col Rich, who was working at his desk, said: 'I would be the first
one to clear this up if I could, but I'm gagged from a legal standpoint.'
Asked whether he was being made responsible for the financial transactions,
Col Rich said: 'I don't have the authority to act on my own. No officer
does.'
In the UK territorial headquarters Col Byrne was in charge of fundraising at
the lower end of a chain of command which led upwards through Col Rich to
the chief secretary, Commissioner Ian Cutmore, and the territorial
commander, Commissioner John Larsson.
At least two of those accused of fraud in the army's writ - Mr Gamil Naguib
and Mr Stuart Ford - have disappeared. Mr Naguib is a director of two
British companies: Guardian Guarantee and Shellsouth. Both share a
registered office, now abandoned, in Shepherd Street, central London.
It has emerged that Mr Naguib, who is listed as a Canadian national, has
been under investigation by the Fraud Squad since last year in relation to
fraudulent financial transactions associated with the Islamic Pan American
Bank, also named in the writ.
The Central Bank of Argentina said that the Islamic Pan American Bank, based
in Buenos Aires, was never on its register. It has emerged that the US
Internal Revenue Service took papers from the Dallas office associated with
the bank last year.
Both Mr Naguib's companies describe their purpose as financial services. But
neither company is on the Securities and Investments Board's central
register, which lists all approved investment advisory firms.
Shellsouth was created in spring 1991, but is being pursued by Companies
House because it has never filed accounts. Guardian Guarantee's latest
accounts, for the year to December 31 1991, show a retained loss of Pounds
98,000.
The company's auditor was a north London firm called Babs Sobanjo, which
cannot now be traced. It no longer holds a practising certificate with the
Chartered Association of Certified Accountants.
Mr Stuart Ford, named in the writ in association with Tilen Securities,
traded some years ago in a different firm involved in property development
and operating from the address given for Tilen.
Tilen is located in a row of shops in the Birmingham suburb of Acocks Green
and was shut down early last week according to the owners of neighbouring
properties. Yesterday a padlocked screen covered the front of the premises.
The owner of one shop said Tilen had been trading at that address for at
least three years.
Mr Jasbir S. Mudhar, who trades as JPR Accountants &amp; Financial Services, was
also named in the writ.
He is not accused of fraud, but the charity is seeking a declaration that
any monies he holds on its behalf should be returned. He said yesterday that
early last year he had handled a business transaction for Mr Ford, but that
he was unaware that it concerned the Salvation Army. He said he had not had
any further dealings with Mr Ford since then.
'I did not know whose money it was,' Mr Mudhar said. 'We had no idea what it
was. We just followed instructions. Everything we have done is proper. We
simply handled something on instructions and I have no idea what transpired
after that.
'Everything is above board and within the law. We are a professional
practice and we would run away faster than Daley Thompson from anything that
was not. We would not be associated with anything like that, and we have
nothing to fear.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Banks may have accepted discount on Battersea debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SYNDICATE of banks which in effect controls the Battersea Power Station
site is believed to have taken a discount on its debt of more than 90 per
cent in a deal that will ultimately pass control to a Hong Kong property
family.
The Hwang family, who are acquiring the site, refused to disclose the price
they paid for the debt in a deal completed yesterday. But it is understood
that the syndicate, led by Bank of America, accepted less than Pounds 10m
for signing over its claim on the 31-acre site - its collateral for a debt
thought to total more than Pounds 100m, including interest and penalty fees.
The deal leaves the Hwangs studing options for acquiring the site from its
owner, Battersea Leisure, a company owned by Mr John Broome, whose plans to
transform the site into a leisure complex ran into financial difficulties
three years ago when restoration work went over budget.
The Hwangs could repossess the 31-acre site and the power station building
from Battersea Leisure. An alternative might be to appoint a receiver for
the company, who would put the site on the open market. As owners of the
debt the Hwangs would have the option to top any offer that was less than
the total debt.
Mr Victor Hwang, the 39-year-old chief executive of the Hong Kong Parkview
Group, the Hong Kong listed company in which his family has a 75 per cent
controlling stake, said that he wanted to preserve the 1930s power station
building, which is listed for its architectural and historical interest.
'Certainly there is no intention to tear it down,' he said, adding that he
would be looking at making a cohesive development on the surrounding site,
possibly in a style to complement the building's Art Deco architecture.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Revelations fuel senior employees' concerns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REVELATIONS of alleged fraud this week has fuelled concern among senior
Salvation Army employees. They believe that a recent restructuring, which
separated the UK financial operations from international operations, allowed
the scandal to take place, a senior source close to the charity said last
night.
Although the leadership is not accused of any wrongdoing, there is concern
in the organisation about its management style.
'The news has come as a real shock to us workers,' a Salvation Army worker
said yesterday as he stood stacking hymn sheets in a dusty church hall. 'But
then perhaps we don't really understand the money side of things as well as
we should.'
Founded in the early 19th century by Victorian phil-anthropist William
Booth, the charity first made its name fighting urban poverty.
A century later its task remains broadly similar. With an overall membership
of 2m, the charity conducts work among the poor, dispossessed and homeless
in 94 countries.
It claims to be one of the largest voluntary groups in the world, and in
Britain is the second-largest provider of social services.
Nevertheless, the central tenets of the organisation remain little changed -
workers speak of their crusade as a 'war', in which discipline is paramount.
The result is a management style which, as a charity accountant noted, is
distinctly 'autocratic'.
Adherents claim these values create commitment. Critics say that it has made
many in the organisation dangerously trusting over finances.
So far obedience has dampened open dissent, and officers have been told not
to talk to the press.
Captain Charles King, editor of the organisation's vividly named War Cry
magazine, said: 'The general attitude is that we should get on with the work
we're doing. We don't exist to make a profit, but to help people.'
But debate is growing, fuelled by the forthcoming election of the 'general'
 -the highest rank in the charity.
Recent issues of the charity's Salvationist journal have printed letters
calling for greater transparency in financial and management matters.
One worker in London said yesterday: 'All our accounts are published. But
human nature being what it is people just don't bother to read them.'
Salvation Army workers deny the affair has caused a decrease in donations or
affected their annual collecting campaign.

FT  27 FEB 93 / BA attacked over ticket system

<TEXT>
THE three big US airlines, which are opposing plans by British Airways and
USAir to implement a code-sharing agreement, have argued that the UK-based
airline has 'no valid legal claim' to unconditional code-sharing rights.
Under 'code-sharing' agreements, airlines are permitted to use for internal
flights each others' designated flight numbers to facilitate sales of
tickets through the airline reservation system.
BA has claimed that it was given a right to code-sharing with a US carrier
under revisions to the bilateral aviation agreement between the US and the
UK which was negotiated in March 1991.
These revisions were agreed in return for concesssions on the UK side, which
allowed American Airlines and United Airlines to replace Pan Am and TWA as
the two US carriers permitted to use London's Heathrow Airport.
However, the US carriers now note that the provisions of the March 1991
Memorandum of Consultations become effective 'only upon an exchange of notes
between the US and UK governments - something that has not as yet happened.
'The MOC also states that pending such an exchange of notes, its provisions
will be governed by the principles of comity and reciprocity,' they add,
arguing that the proposed integration of services between BA and USAir would
run contrary to such principles.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Compulsory register proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS FOR a compulsory register of the 1m largest UK businesses were
announced yesterday by chambers of commerce, Charles Batchelor writes.
The register would allow the government to gather more accurate information
about business and improve communications between government and the
business community, the chambers said.
It would also allow a streamlining of the procedures by which many
businesses are required to obtain a licence before they can trade. The
business registration centres, which would be based in chambers, could act
as a single application point. The register would cover about 1m companies,
partnerships, co-operatives and sole traders, and so would be more extensive
than records kept at Companies House. But it would not cover the smallest
businesses.
The government has welcomed the proposal as a means of reducing the burden
of red tape on business.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, yesterday called on health
authorities to ensure that patients received emergency treatment when they
needed it, following publication of a survey showing restricted hospital
admissions because of shortage of funds.
The survey from the British Medical Association showed that hospitals in
every English region were introducing restrictions on admissions as money
ran out before the end of the financial year.
Restrictions were significantly greater in the south of England, the BMA
survey found, with three of the four London regions reporting the highest
levels. Surgical specialities were hardest hit with more than half the
surgeons and gynaecologists in the survey facing restrictions.
The survey found evidence of ward and bed closures, and non-emergency
admissions restricted to patients of GP fundholders or those who have been
waiting for long periods.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Labour offers talks on terror law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR OFFERED yesterday to discuss reform of the anti-terrorism laws with
the government, Alison Smith writes. Mr Kevin McNamara, shadow Northern
Ireland secretary, said: 'It is time to build a new understanding between
the parties.'
The Tories have argued that Labour's refusal to support the existing
prevention-of-terrorism measures shows that the party is not serious about
fighting crime in general. The annual order renewing those measures -
condemned by Labour as harsh and ineffectual - will soon go before the
Commons.
Mr McNamara said talks with the government should include ending orders
which exclude people from Northern Ireland or Great Britain. Mr Kenneth
Clarke, home secretary, said it would be 'irresponsible' during an IRA
mainland campaign to remove the power to issue exclusion orders.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Proposals for Daf buy-out expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADMINISTRATIVE receivers of the Leyland Daf van manufacturing plant at
Birmingham are expected to receive firm proposals on Monday for a management
buy-out.
The management team, led by managing director Mr Allen Amey, is believed to
have formulated a plan for the vans operation to continue as a stand-alone
business relying initially on the UK market alone.
Neither the receivers, Mr John Talbot and Mr Murdoch McKillop of accountants
Arthur Andersen, nor executives at the plant, would last night confirm
details of the proposals or how they might be funded.
But it is known that informal talks have started between the buy-out team -
believed to comprise six executives - and local Department of Trade and
Industry officials on whether the managers' proposals would qualify for aid.
Yesterday the plant, at Washwood Heath on Birmingham's outskirts, was
continuing production against an order book now said to extend to 10 weeks,
boosted by orders from Birmingham City Council, which is seeking to persuade
other local authorities to follow suit. Royal Mail and Parcelforce, the vans
operation's biggest customers, have also kept orders in place.
A meeting of Leyland Daf's dealer council is understood to have pledged
support for the managers' buy-out proposals.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Bank faces new BCCI criticism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England faced fresh criticism of its handling of the failed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International yesterday when 43 MPs, including Labour
frontbenchers, called for a review of Mr Eddie George's appointment as
governor-designate.
The MPs called in a Commons early day motion for Mr George's appointment to
be reviewed by the cross-party Treasury and Civil Service select committee,
which this week published a report highly critical of the Bank's performance
in the BCCI affair.
The motion urged the appointment of an outsider 'untainted by the soiled and
over-cosy ethos' at the Bank.
In a separate motion a cross-party group of 19 MPs stepped up the campaign
for the government to reconsider compensation for BCCI depositors. The MPs -
headed by Mr Keith Vaz, Labour MP for Leicester East and Sir Rhodes Boyson,
a former Tory education minister - called on chancellor Norman Lamont to
meet representatives of those who lost money in the bank's closure.

FT  27 FEB 93 / US growth hits 4.8% in 4th quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US economy expanded at an annual rate of 4.8 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1992, the fastest pace since the end of 1987, revised Commerce
Department figures indicated yesterday.
The new figures, which represent an upward revision of 1 percentage point on
the initial estimates a month ago, indicate the economy was growing robustly
during the closing stages of last year's election campaign when former
President George Bush was widely condemned for failing to revive the
economy.
Few forecasters expect the fourth-quarter growth rate to be sustained in the
early months of 1993, mainly because consumption ran ahead of incomes and
because US exports are expected to be hit by the slowdown in Europe and
Japan. But most are confident that the US is now set for several years of
annual growth of about 3 per cent.
The recent fall in long bond yields to below 7 per cent is expected to lead
to further increases in business investment which grew at an annual rate of
nearly 10 per cent in the fourth quarter.
Other figures yesterday were mildly disappointing. An index of consumer
confidence compiled by the University of Michigan fell slightly this month,
partly because of adverse reaction to higher taxes announced by President
Bill Clinton last week.
The very strong GDP figures, however, may strengthen the hand of
conservative Democrats and Republicans in Congress who are arguing that Mr
Clinton's Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21bn) short-term stimulus package of
infrastructure spending and investment incentives is no longer needed.
Critics argue that Mr Clinton should press ahead more quickly with spending
cuts needed to bring down the budget deficit. The administration, however,
continues to emphasise the slow rate of job creation and the relatively high
unemployment rate.
The fourth-quarter expansion followed growth at an annual rate of 3.4 per
cent in the third quarter. It was the seventh successive quarter of growth
following the official end of the recession in the spring of 1991.
Revisions to net exports accounted for about half of the upward revision to
fourth-quarter growth, according to Mr Jim O'Sullivan, an economist at J P
Morgan. Real exports grew at an annual rate of 9.8 per cent relative to the
third quarter, against 3.7 per cent in initial estimates.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Emergency package to create jobs in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN'S socialist government, which faces one of the most serious
unemployment problems in the European Community, yesterday announced an
emergency package of job creation measures.
The package, which will be debated in parliament next week, is a belated
response to a sharp rise in unemployment which set in last autumn.
Unemployment figures released earlier this month revealed that nearly half a
million jobs were lost during 1992, bringing the total number of jobless to
a record 3.05m, equivalent to 20.06 per cent of the labour force.
Yesterday's package includes fiscal benefits for medium and small companies,
new guidelines on apprenticeship schemes and incentives for companies with
part-time employees. It also includes a provision for extending by one year
the three-year labour contracts that cover about a third of Spanish workers.
Under existing labour regulations companies have either to dismiss an
employee when a contract expires or offer permanent employment.
Government officials said the measures, partly financed by EC cohesion funds
and European Investment Bank loans, will have no impact on the restrictive
1993 budget, which is intended to lower the government deficit and inflation
in order to meet convergence targets ahead of European monetary union.
The government insists that the peseta will remain within the European
Monetary System and the Bank of Spain has intervened throughout the week to
keep the currency in the middle of its 6 per cent fluctuation band within
the exchange rate mechanism and close to Pta72 to the D-Mark.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Clinton calls for open trade to lift world growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   Washington
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday asserted US leadership in the task of
speeding up world economic growth and taking down trade barriers, but called
on Japan and Germany to do their share as 'engines of global prosperity'.
He also sought to dispel fears that the US was becoming more inward-looking
and protectionist under his administration, insisting America 'must compete,
not retreat'.
As finance ministers and central bank governors flew to London for today's
meeting of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations, Mr Clinton
complained that international economic co-operation was not working well.
'We simply cannot afford to work at cross-purposes with the other major
industrial democracies,' he said. 'Our major partners must work harder and
more closely with us to reduce interest rates, stimulate investment, reduce
structural barriers to trade and restore robust global growth.'
Speaking to cheering university students in Washington, Mr Clinton said the
world stood at a rare 'great moment of decision' about the need for
co-operation. Germany and Japan especially should do more for the global
economy and open their markets to foreign goods, he said.
Cautioning against trade protectionism in the US, he said: 'The truth of our
age is this, and must be this: open and competitive commerce will enrich us
as a nation. . . It spurs us to innovate.
'And so I say to you in the face of all the pressures to do the reverse, we
must compete, not retreat.'
He acknowledged that many of the US's competitiveness problems had primary
roots in US policies. 'There is much about our competitive posture that
cannot be straightened out by trade retaliation,' he said. 'Too many of the
chains that have hobbled us in competitive trade have been made in America.'
But Mr Clinton said the US would also enforce its trade laws, insist on
reciprocal opportunities overseas for US investors, and take measures to
help US communities hurt by the adaptation to a global economy.
'In short, putting the American people first, without withdrawing from the
world and people beyond our borders,' he said.
The speech was applauded by Ms Carla Hills, Mr Bush's trade negotiator, but
may not dispel the questions of the US's trading partners in the EC and
Japan, who in the five weeks since Mr Clinton took office have had to weigh
every declaration of free trade principles against announcements of new
dumping duties on steel imports or new inquiries into Airbus subsidies.
Just minutes after Mr Clinton spoke, Mr Mickey Kantor, US trade
representative, repeated that the US wished to review all aspects of its
deal with Airbus shareholders over subsidies.
Mr Clinton sought to outline a middle way between the extremes of absolute
free trade and protectionism, and to situate his trade policy in the broader
context of his domestic economic programme and of his foreign policy goals.
He also argued that bilateral, regional and multilateral approaches all had
their place in trade policy.
Linking the spread of democracy in China, the developing world and the
former Soviet Union to economic growth and the development of free trade,
the president said a 'fair distribution of the fruits of growth among an
increasingly restive world population' would bring 'dividends of trade, of
friendship and peace'.
'Trade, of course, cannot ensure the survival of democracy. . . but if we
believe in the bonds of democracy, we must resolve to strengthen the bonds
of commerce,' he said. The president used his speech partly to explain to
his trades union and business community backers why he would not adopt a
firmly protectionist stance and to bid for more support for his package of
taxes and spending measures.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Five die in blast at tallest tower in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE people were killed and up to 500 injured yesterday when an underground
explosion rocked the World Trade Center in New York, sending smoke up
through the twin 110-storey office towers.
The blast, which ripped through a car park and train station below the Trade
Center complex, was being blamed increasingly last night on a bomb. A few
hours after the explosion, police evacuated the Empire State Building
because of a bomb threat and security was reported to have been tightened at
New York airports.
A helicopter airlifted a pregnant woman to safety from the roof of one of
the towers, the second tallest buildings in the world.
With electricity shut off, hundreds of people were stranded in the towers
for hours, many stuck in lifts and others climbing down dark, smoke-filled
stairs. Some walked down from as high as the 105th floor.
Financial markets in New York were thrown in disarray because the many
brokers and financial service firms housed in the World Trade Center had to
shut down their operations.
The explosion left a gaping hole in the underground car park and brought
down the ceiling of the Port Authority-Trans Hudson train station below it.
Most of the injured suffered from inhaling smoke that billowed up through
lift shafts, stairways and ventilator systems.
The blast was being investigated by the New York City Police bomb squad and
the FBI. As accidental causes such as a gas leak or electrical fire were
ruled out, the authorities said unofficially it looked increasingly like a
bombing.
One newsagency said it had learnt that a group claiming to represent
Croatian militants made a phone call 15 minutes before the explosion to
claim responsibility.
Another unconfirmed report said a local police station got a phone call from
a group calling itself the 'Serbian Liberation Front' claiming to have
caused the blast.
Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly, speaking to reporters at the scene, would
not confirm or deny that a bomb was involved. He said police had received
seven calls, none claiming responsibility, though one caller said: 'It was
not an accident.'
About 100,000 people work at the buildings in the World Trade Centre
complex, including the twin towers, which rank second in height to the Sears
Tower office block in Chicago.
One office worker, teaching an accounting class on the 94th floors, said:
'I'm just glad to be alive. We felt the tremor. It was like being in an
earthquake.'
Office workers put moistened towels and clothing over their faces as they
made their way through the smoke to the exits.
One stock broker told how he was on the 31st floor when the explosion hit.
He got down to the 13th floor, but a locked exit door left him stranded with
70 other people in an office where they smashed some windows to get air.
They were freed by firefighters after about 45 minutes.
The fire caused limited damage to some over-the-counter market computers at
brokerage firms and led to the early closing of the New York Mercantile
Exchange and the Commodity Exchange at the complex.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Books: The taming of the beast - Anthony Curtis reviews
Brian Moore's latest novel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY CURTIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO OTHER LIFE by Brian Moore Bloomsbury Pounds 14.99, 216 pages
WHAT DID Graham Greene really mean when he said that Brian Moore treated the
novel like a wild beast and tamed it? Barely suppressed violence is a
constant element in all Moore's novels, of which No Other Life is the 17th.
The turmoil invariably erupts in some kind of bloodbath sustained over final
purgatorial chapters with great narrative skill. In this one the underlying
violence is that of the Duvalier 'Papa Doc' regime, and its legacy, in
Haiti. The island, with its elite of mulattoes, its military junta, its
terrible gangster police and its down-trodden black peasantry, appears here
in fictional form as Ganae where the narrator has for many years been a
Roman Catholic priest.
Father Paul Michael looks back over his life on the island and the
charismatic career of his native protege 'Jeannot' whom we see being
recruited into his order. This character owes much to the young priest Fr.
Jean-Bertrand Aristide of the order of St Francois de Sales, who in the late
1980s proclaimed from his pulpit that Haiti would never achieve democratic
elections unless the government was overthrown. Aristide was one of those
who, while inciting his flock to political action, found support for it in
the Bible. 'Part of our mission,' he said, 'is to destroy the capitalist
system. Socialism is closer to the gospel than either capitalism or
communism'. It was Liberation Theology with a vengeance. Moore tackles it
here head on, and with great understanding.
We have been to Haiti before in a modern Catholic novel - in 1958 in
Greene's The Comedians. But in Moore, unlike Greene, you do not have that
deja vu feeling of familiar content being served up in a fresh setting.
Every Moore novel is a new beginning. There is no such place as Mooreland.
Wherever Moore's novels are set - Belfast, the South of France, Hollywood, a
Californian campus, Toronto, Montreal - the characters are creatures of
their environment, true natives, instantly recognisable as such.
Moore has moved around the world a good deal since 1921 when he was born in
Belfast to be educated at St Malachy's, a Catholic College, where he had his
first experience of a violent disciplinary regime; it became the setting for
his early novel The Feast of Lupercal. In 1948 Moore emigrated to Canada
where he worked as a journalist. He eventually became a Canadian citizen,
but one who lives now in Southern California. In his earlier books the
battle-ground tended to be domestic and professional. He dramatised the
power struggle as it affected relations between men and women at work as
well as at home. As an artist Moore is equally accomplished in identifying
with, and narrating through, people of either gender. Entire novels may be
carried by larger than life heroines, starting with that superb creation,
portrayed so memorably by Maggie Smith on screen, the alcoholic Belfast
spinster Judith Hearne.
But latterly Moore has turned from the contemplation of domestic disorders
to forms of martyrdom - individuals forced to suffer from the pressure of
history on account of their religious faith. Moore was born into a Catholic
family and was from his cradle indoctrinated into the religion which he now
says he uses in his books only as 'a metaphor'. But even if he has adopted
an agnostic position in his own outlook, religious belief remains an
essential ingredient in the Brian Moore fictional mix. In a study of a
modern liberated woman, the chic neurotic New Yorker heroine of I Am Mary
Dunne, there sounds a far away parental voice on the phone with timely
reminders of the doctrine of sin and redemption. And there is just such a
wise voice in this new novel; but this time it is the parent's function to
put the alternative view from which the novel takes its negative title, that
our present existence is the only one we have, and that there is 'no other
life' to console us.
If that is really true, it makes it so much harder for Father Michael to
reconcile himself to the spectacle of corruption and exploitation, of
abysmal poverty and cynical indifference to it by the ruling caste, that
Moore evokes so powerfully in this short, explosive book. Moore brings this
world pulsatingly to life through vivid descriptive writing and a series of
beautifully accurate vignettes of the people surrounding his hero. He traces
the steps through which Jeannot turns from a compassionate young acolyte
into a clerical demagogue whose followers hail him as a saviour. Jeannot's
moment of supreme power inaugurates a reign that is brief and ineffectual.
It concludes with the dictator Jeannot's final appearance in front of massed
crowds after which he mysteriously disappears, sucked back, as it were, into
anonymity, into the sun-baked soil from which he first emerged. This
movie-like finish ends an enthralling, thought-provoking tale. Once again
the fictional beast has been well and truly tamed.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Go easy on the copycat criminals: Where computer software
companies see only theft they could find profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX WILKINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT IS wrong with theft if nobody gets hurt and nobody notices any loss?
Not much, say thousands of people who routinely fiddle their income tax,
conspire to avoid payment of Value Added Tax or make minor depredations
against their insurance companies. It is wrong, of course, because the
honest citizens suffer from higher taxes or insurance premiums, even if they
cannot connect these with any particular rip-off.
However, there is one form of theft, now being vigorously combated, which
many otherwise honest people commit with little or no sense of shame: the
pirating of computer software. Illegal copying is made ever easier by the
development of faster personal computers and higher capacity magnetic
storage disks (the sort which are posted into the front of the machine and
can be slipped into a shirt pocket).
Programmes for word processing, doing accounts or spreadsheets costing
between Pounds 200 and Pounds 400 can be stored on a few disks which can be
bought for around a fiver. So the temptation to borrow a friend's programme
disks and make a copy is high, especially as the risk of detection is
minimal. Not surprisingly, the software companies are anxious to stamp out
the practice, which they see as a straightforward theft of copyright and a
significant threat to the revenues of their multi-billion dollar industry.
Some well-publicised raids on companies which have allowed copies to be
passed illegally from one machine to another, aggressively worded licensing
agreements and a few programing tricks have all helped to make respectable
folk a little bit more awkward about unlicensed copying.
Yet many people feel that there is something silly about present licence
agreements, as there was in the discarded law that banned the tape-recording
of radio broadcasts for personal use. In the days when personal computers
were almost all to be found in offices, a tough stand against copying may
have made sense, for the software company must recoup high development costs
from a product whose manufacturing cost (copying a few disks) is tiny. But
computers are fast becoming a standard piece of domestic equipment in middle
class homes and private individuals do not wish to pay Pounds 200 to Pounds
300 for a programme which they may use only occasionally. On the other hand,
they do not want to struggle with an obsolete programme which may be much
harder to use than the one they have in the office.
So they make an unofficial copy, and their reasons for doing this deserve a
hearing. At that price, says the pirate, I would never have bought a legal
copy, so the vendor is not deprived of a sale. Indeed, the software company
may benefit if I decide to buy an upgraded version or a manual (which some
companies sell separately).
Anyway, says the pirate, warming to his theme, it is all the software
company's fault for trying to charge me ten times his marginal cost of
production. What is more he is inciting me to piracy by making it difficult
for me to buy the previous (outdated) version of the product at a reasonable
price.
Without doubt, excessively restrictive licence agreements (limiting use to
one person on one machine) have contributed strongly to making these
infringements widely tolerated among people who would be happy to pay a
moderate fee to 'stay legal'. Software companies have been slow to learn the
lesson from the airlines that empty seats can be sold at low prices, without
destroying revenues from business class users.
The industry has at last started to recognise these arguments by selling
'economy class' programmes at a much lower price than the up-to-date full
versions aimed at the business market, but prices are still high compared
with the cost of making a copy, and some of the restrictions imposed on
business users who might want make a copy of a programme in order to take
their work home are absurdly tight.
Now that each copy of a programme can be labelled with the name of its
legitimate user, it is possible to make the possessors of pirate versions
feel uncomfortable, every time they switch on. So it is time for the
industry to combine this moral lever with more relaxed conditions for
limited copying and aggressive mass market pricing of top quality programmes
(not just clapped out versions).
In this way they will de-criminalise large sections of the middle classes -
and possibly make money too.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: A word from your clutter buddy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   I WAS IN Palm Springs, California, last weekend
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the best place I know in which to veg out in February. To this end I took
walks in the desert, sat by still pools, swung a few tennis rackets, lived
on date shakes and was careful not to read anything more irk-making than
Joseph Wambaugh or The New York Times. (I tell a lie. I read a bit of
Balzac. But in Palm Springs they think that Balzac is a hairdresser, so that
was fine by them).
Only once did my mobile phone chirrup, and then it was the president,
calling from Air Force One. 'Hiya, Michael,' said the president, 'just
thought that I'd touch base.'
'Good afternoon, Mr President.'
'Bill will still do,' he said. 'William at a pinch. There is no call for
ceremony.' His voice sounded hoarse. 'I heard you were in the Springs,
soaking up the rays.'
I said: 'We have our problems, too, you know. We're expecting a storm
tonight.'
'Get away,' said the president. The reason he was calling, he explained, was
to see whether I had any course-setting ideas to help him dodge the
'tax-and-spend' flak caused by his speech to Congress in which he detailed
initial remedies for America's woebegone economy.
'I have told my people,' he said, 'that you have a great idea about once in
seven months, so what have you got for me? Let me hear your input.'
My brain churned into action. I signalled to the pool waiter to bring me -
por favor - a grapefruit juice.
I said: 'I do have an idea. It comes from reading the Word Watch column in
The Atlantic by Anne H Soukhanov. She describes preliminary research into
some of the words and phrases being tracked by the editors of The American
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, third edition (Houghton
Mifflin). New words and phrases that exhibit sustained use may eventually
make their way into the dictionary, says the magazine.
'The phrase that caught my eye was clutter buddy. If you ask me, William, we
should go to work on clutter buddy. Your presidency has started well. I
admired your speech to Congress. It will be a while, yet, before the dozy
columnists at the Post and Times wake to the full potential of your
presidency. They are still habituated to the multi-trillion wastrelism and
political cowardice of the Reagan-Bush years. But they will stir from their
torpor soon. To give them a kick, you should appoint a string of clutter
buddies.'
There was silence from Air Force One.
'Soukhanov says a clutter buddy is one who supports another person in
sorting and discarding accumulated possessions. She says that the
anti-clutter movement of the 1990s - thought by some to be a reaction to the
acquisitiveness of the '80's - is manifest in clutter clinics; in adult
education classes in clutter management, which have produced some 200,000
clutter graduates, and in clutter hot-lines and de-clutter guidebooks.
'According to Soukhanov, people drowning in clutter are advised to start
small: to clean a small area, perhaps 12 inches square. Keep it clean. Then
go on to another spot. Experts in clutter management also advise that people
give themselves frequent rewards along the way.
'This is a big idea, William. An extremely big idea. You could be in the
White House for eight years. After that, Hillary Rodham Clinton could be
president, followed by Chelsea. We are talking 2016, William.
'But you have got to make your mark in the next few months. Appoint clutter
buddies throughout Washington. Every cabinet member must have one. Their
powers must be absolute. The reason the planet is suffering so cruelly is
that governments everywhere are moving far too slowly. They are sinking in
an ocean of intellectual garbage.
'They find themselves trussed and bound like carcasses at a meat show. Their
reaction times are pathetic. Where is the vision thing? Poverty. Pollution.
Over-population. All these matters are swamping us yet governments are
scuttling crab-wise, afraid of their own shadows.
'The solution is simple: bring on the clutter buddies. We need them
everywhere. Throw out the garbage]'
'That is great,' said the president. 'Everyone on Air Force One is beholden
to you, Michael.'
I said: 'Think nothing of it, Bill. God bless America]'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Private View: A pastor at the grass roots - Fr Michael
Conaty's parish is poor. He thinks poverty is a sin, but a sin the poor do
not commit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PARISH priest of St. Anthony's is a burly Irishman with a good golf
handicap and 30 years' experience in the shipyards and housing estates of
Newcastle upon Tyne.
'Poverty is a sin,' he said, 'but it is a sin that the poor do not commit.'
Unemployment, crime and punishment have this week provoked a frenzy of
analysis by British commentators following the arrest of two 10-year-old
boys for the murder of a two-year-old child on Merseyside and the
reappearance of a national jobless total of 3m. I went to look for someone
who knew about such things at first hand and who carried no ideological
brief.
Fr Michael Conaty's views would be unpopular in London. The Left would
object to his enthusiasm for self-help and traditional morals, the Right to
his emphasis on compassion and forgiveness. But they are views with a weight
of experience behind them.
Fr Conaty is an activist, not an analyst. Around the church of St. Anthony
of Padua in the district of Walker he has built, with donations and public
money, a day care centre for the old, a youth club, training workshops, and
plans an information office for job seekers.
I asked him what he understood by 'the underclass'.
'Can I say straight away that this language is not in the vocabulary of the
Church at all,' he replied. 'It's a judgment that society is making on one
part of itself.'
He prefers the word 'outcast' to describe those who have given up the
struggle against a hostile system. 'But the marvellous thing about poor
people is that they are all the time striving to be better.'
Better off materially?
'Not so much materially. They are seeking a better quality of life. Poor
people, by and large, are seeking education, they are seeking spiritual
development.
Apart from low income, how does poverty show itself?
'In an area like this, very, very deeply. There's a tremendous spiritual
poverty. There is an emotional and psychological poverty. That's why you
can't talk about the poor and the underclass in the same bracket. Poor
people are probably driven into the underclass by what society is doing to
them.'
Last Sunday his parishioners prayed not only for the murdered child but for
the two boys who were arrested. Because whoever committed that crime, Fr
Conaty said, was as much sinned against as sinning. 'When we are sinned
against we reach a stage when we cannot take any more; something within us
explodes.'
Aren't there too many people like you who see criminals as victims? John
Major thinks society needs to 'condemn a little more and understand a little
less'.
Fr Conaty called the politicians' responses 'pathetic', and said: 'I do
accept that murderers must be removed from society. But having removed them
we have to look at what we are doing for them. There is an awful lot of
self-righteousness going on. I find the harsh judgments that are made, the
harsh statements in the media, very stark, lacking in compassion. We condemn
the people rather than the crime itself.'
The priest's Irish accent is unmarked by 35 years in the north-east of
England; when he is emphatic his voice drops to a wheezy smoker's whisper.
But when he made a disparaging reference to 'market forces' and I suggested
that was code for a certain former prime minister, he burst out laughing and
his broad face flushed red. He did not reply.
Does poverty cause crime, or is crime a matter of choice?
'There's crime at the highest level of society.' He paused, mentioned a
name, and, laughing again, asked me not to quote it. 'I'm making the simple
point that poverty and crime are not linked at all.'
Aren't they?
'Unfortunately poor people are driven to crime in order to survive. I'm
speaking here of the ordinary things they do to each other, like stealing.
But there's crimes at a level of society that are done deliberately for
greed and nothing else.'
But when your own car was stolen and burned out on the field there, that was
not for survival.
'No, well, unfortunately the people who do that are rebelling. They are
rebelling against those who have and it's a way of expressing the rebellion.
It is a fact that they don't understand the difference between right and
wrong.'
Fr Conaty described taking a group of children to Lindisfarne where they
collected dead birds and rats to bring home. They were fascinated by fire,
death and killing, he said. I asked him why.
'I want to use the right words here. I wouldn't want to judge these children
at all.'
He paused a long time and said: 'These young people do not know what it is
to be really loved. Because they are coming from backgrounds which have not
got that capacity to really love. This is the spiritual poverty that's
within. And while they might know that seeing blood, killing things, is
wrong, they don't understand why it's wrong. They've got a very low
self-esteem. And they suffer the pain of being the children of rejection.
They are the children of rejection and they're moving into a society of
rejection. One of the ways rejection shows itself is in destruction and
violence of all sorts.'
The collapse of discipline, of a moral sense, was due entirely to the
collapse of family life, he said. An extreme example was society's
willingness to let homosexual couples adopt children. And of course divorce
had been made easy.
'What we have is the product of the permissive society of the 1960s.' He
said liberation was a middle-class phenomenon that had been imposed on
poorer people. 'People don't want those sort of changes. That's why Catholic
schools are bursting at the seams.
'What we have become - and we're afraid to admit it - is a pagan society.
We're no longer a Christian country.'
Fr Conaty believes in the Devil. 'You cannot deny the reality of Satan and
you would be blind not to recognise his influence. But it is unspoken about
because people don't want to give him that glory.'
Fr. Conaty maintains that British policymakers and administrators do not
understand the problem of poverty. 'Because they have only one way of
tackling it and that is through glorious handouts. More is needed: people
must be given the freedom and the space must be opened for them to be able
to help themselves.'
Have the churches failed to understand the problem?
'I think in the last 30 years the social teaching of the churches has become
tremendously aware of the poor. But you have the one-eyed god stuck in the
corner day after day feeding people one gospel and we're trying to feed them
another. So there's constant confusion and conflict.'
If you had the power, what specifically would you do?
'I would take a thousand families in a poor area like this and I would give
them complete ownership of the area, of their own problems. I would resource
them financially, but I would take them out, broaden their horizons, try and
help them to be creative with their own skills and talents and to work
together as a community. The most important resource of those thousand
families are not the houses or anything else  - it is the people. There is a
solidarity among people in these situations.
'You see, everything that comes to them now is dictated from the top and it
is all with terms and conditions. Any money that's given must make a
political statement, must give glory to the system.
'I wouldn't be about changing their minds at all or changing their life
styles. I'd be about changing their hearts.'
Michael Conaty is 59, one of six children born to a farming couple in Cavan
in the Irish Republic. His father died when the eldest child was still 12
and the family knew poverty. Another brother is a priest near Durham.
He likes football and television news, takes the Guardian and Independent,
reads spiritual essays and anything by Peter Ustinov. He has read the works
of Mao Tse-tung and avidly follows developments in the ex-Communist bloc.
His political hero is Willy Brandt, the former West German Chancellor.
Perhaps people would say you are just a dyed-in-the- wool traditionalist
Catholic priest.
'No, I'm not.'
Do you preach hell-fire?
'No. I just love people and I preach the love of God.' His voice dropped. 'I
have a tremendous awareness of the love of God and I share that with people.
I'm not a man for rules and regulations. I pastor people in whatever
circumstances they're in. I encourage them. I embrace them.
'You see, we're not doing things for people, we're helping them to be.'
Later, he said. 'The priest is not a social worker. The social worker is
about changing people's attitudes, their minds, supporting them at a very
human level. But there is a spiritual need that all the time must be
satisfied.
You don't mean they want to go to Church every Sunday?
'No. The spiritual hunger is for someone to recognise them as they are.'
Do you have a struggle with your religious faith?
'Where I struggle is that I get angry when I see what is happening to people
here. I can get angry with God, angry with the Church, I get angry with the
system. Because I see the destructive force that political systems are to
people in this area. I have to come to terms with that in my own life.'
An hour before, Fr Conaty had visited a field near the Swan Hunter shipyard
used by children for motorbike scrambling. Residents approve; the police
want it closed. He promised to help.
I referred to this and said: a cynic would say 'Fr. Conaty is a good man but
really he's just trying to net souls.'
'What I am is a fisher of people's hearts, you know. I'm not looking for
anything from them. All the time I'm trying to give them what is good for
them.'
You're trying to get them the field, but you're trying to get them to heaven
as well.
'No, I don't get them to heaven. That's God's job.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Job for a millionaire - Off the Wall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is a millionaire out there who enjoys first nights at the opera and
the theatre and has a fairly clear diary for the next five years the perfect
job is hovering on the horizon. Lord Palumbo has made it plain that he will
relinquish the chairmanship of the Arts Council when his term comes to an
end in April 1994.
Lord Palumbo was far from being the first choice when selected but he has
grown in confidence over the years and no one could fault him on diligence.
He made the Council his life, helped perhaps by the comatose state of the
property market, the source of his fortune. His major contribution has been
getting the Millennium Fund idea off the ground.
As chairman Lord Palumbo had one other minor advantage to the Government: he
was amazingly cheap. He paid for his car and chauffeur, never claimed
expenses, and entertained Arts Council members, and the arts generally, out
of his own pocket. A successor needs to be almost as rich because the post
is unpaid. Heritage Minister Peter Brooke will probably allow you to claim
travel, and other expenses, if he is really keen for you to do the job.
Who will succeed Palumbo? The likes of Lord Sainsbury, who turned down the
chairmanship last time round, will not be interested. There is always Lord
Archer, but the fragrancy of a women chairperson might favour Lady Archer.
Much depends upon what sort of Arts Council the new chairman will inherit.
The consultants are about to move in again for yet another overhaul and
there may not be much left to rule over.
The Department of Heritage can never quite make up its mind what kind of
Council it wants: in the last five years it has moved from imminent
extinction to extra powers back to shrinkage with uncanny speed. If the
consultants recommend a slimmed down advisory Council, the masthead could
well be served by Prince Edward. On the other hand the main attraction has
always been that it confers a title on the recipient, which could bring a
bright commoner to the fore.

In a recession museums come into their own. They tend to retain their
purchasing grants, however small, while private collectors cut back. The
most expensive Old Master pictures sold these days end up in American
institutions. Last month the Kimbell at Fort Worth paid Dollars 2.4m for a
late 15th century portrait, perhaps by Memling, and this week the Getty in
Malibu gave Pounds 11m to Royal Holloway College for Turner's whirling
seascape, 'Van Tromp going about to please his masters'.
So it is a shrewd move for Colnaghi's, the Bond Street dealers, to invest in
a fine new gallery which, with its red wall covering and natural daylight,
resembles many a museum. It will be used to hang 'museum' pictures, one of
which, a Guercino, has already been sold. The gallery is the jewel from
Colnaghi's acquisition for something approaching Pounds 10m of its adjacent
building, giving it a line of three prime freeholds. Obviously Colnaghi's
owner, German food magnate Rudolf Oetker, is confident that the worst is now
over for Old Masters.
As for the Getty Turner, the Royal Holloway College undoubtedly trampled
over the wishes of its pill-producing founder in selling the painting but it
got a very good price, a record for a British picture. The temporary export
block to give the British a chance to raise a matching sum will be a
formality, and there is much to be said for fine works by the UK's greatest
artist entering major overseas collections. If a gallery in the UK needs a
Turner, the Tate has plenty in its vaults that it might lend.
It is noteworthy that the College sold the Turner privately. In the last
couple of years Turner oils have fared badly in the saleroom: a discreet
sale reduced the hostility to the transaction and prevented a public
failure, which would have lessened the value of the Turner.
The knee-jerk reaction of the museum establishment to the sale overseas was
predictable. Of course it sets an unwelcome precedent, but no comparable
institution has such magnificent pictures and after this furore Royal
Holloway is unlikely to split up its superb art collection. It might even
repair its image by making it more accessible. Turner is poorly represented
overseas: more British people will see it in California than at Egham.
*****
The Festival Hall is seeking to widen its repertoire, and from today until
Tuesday night it will be showing off its flexibility for the very best of
causes. War Child, a charity set up last month to help children caught up in
hostilities, specifically in the former Yugoslavia, has taken the Hall for
four nights. Tonight John Thaw hosts a classical night, with pianist Peter
Donohoe, among others; Sunday features contemporary jazz; Monday comedy with
Jo Brand, Jim Tavare, etc; and Tuesday, rock with the Blues Band, the Bhundu
Boys, and more.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Schubert, with 'piano' foibles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Tuesday Richard Goode played Schubert sonatas on the South Bank; on
Wednesday there were Schubert impromptus in Nikolai Demidenko's Wigmore Hall
programme, the third of six in his 'selectively subjective' conspectus of
the historical repertoire.
These pianists, American and Russian, had little else in common but their
formidably intelligent address - and a couple of foibles. They both allowed
their Steinways heavy, carnivorous roars in the bass, which no instrument
that Schubert and his contemporaries knew could have emitted. Sometimes that
incurred real musical distortions: in Goode's sonatas D537 and D840, and in
Demidenko's otherwise splendid account of the Weber Sonata no. 2, which was
often bottom-heavy. Contrariwise both pianists were shy with lyrical piano
passages, which tended to have wan expressive profiles, treated with the
caution of connoisseurs handling Faberge eggs.
In everything sturdier, they had their own quite different virtues. Every
sound that Demidenko makes has been polished to his own exalted standards of
perfection, every sequence tailored to its context, keyboard-balance finely
calibrated - except in Weber] - and the whole planned to the hilt. That is
his way of realising his chosen scores. Goode, a Classicist of rapidly
widening reputation, goes more aggressively for dramatic sense. His Schubert
had some hard, unlovely moments, but also a wealth of hard-forged ideas, and
urgent purpose.
Goode was generally very sparing with the pedal - perhaps on advice, for too
generous pedalling will blot in the Queen Elizabeth Hall; but the
tantalisingly incomplete D840 did sound uncomfortably lean in places, and
its dramatic turns rudely abrupt. All in all, he seemed to play Schubert as
if he were Beethoven, which was illuminating but not the whole story. The
Beethoven cycle we are promised from Goode next year should be the real
goods.
Demidenko gave us Beethoven, the C major Sonata op. 2 no. 3; it was as good
as expected - clean, elegant, virtuosic - but not excitingly better. As for
his four Schubert Impromptus, D935, it was strange to find the familiar
magical passages simply disappearing beneath such superbly refined pianistic
dress.
After the interval, however, Demidenko made brilliant amends with his Czerny
(the Variations on 'La ricordanza'), his Vorsek Fantasia, and to be fair his
Weber sonata too. Not only were the required digital feats brilliant as
could be, but he melted warmly, almost expansively, into the sentiments of
all that music - partly, no doubt, because they are so explicitly rendered
in the figuration and the arabesques. Given those express demands, Demidenko
revelled in them; and so did we all. A prickly, oblique artist he may be,
but also a master pianist with few peers.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: The essence of Matisse - Even if you went to the New
York exhibition - go to Paris
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THE critical debate that has lately erupted, at least in Britain, as to
the relative worth of the current product of the avant-garde, it is salutary
to be reminded that there is rather more to the modernist tradition than a
urinal, a set of bricks, a fish in a tank or a bloody frozen head. It was,
after all, not so very long ago - around Christmas 1945 - that the
liberation of Europe was opportunely celebrated at the V&amp;A by a joint
exhibition of the work of Picasso and Matisse, to hoots of derision and
letters to The Times.
Picasso at his most mischievously cynical was summoned only the other day to
further the case the modern was never more than the exploitation of the
gullible, an argument to which his work has always given the lie  - witness
the magnificent exhibition of his still-lifes that was in Paris only last
autumn. Now it is the turn of Matisse, whose vast retrospective at the
Museum of Modern Art in New York over the winter was described as the
exhibition of the century. To my chagrin, it was a show I was unable to see,
but now the Centre Pompidou in Paris happily offers a more than compensatory
alternative.
Indeed it is the measure of the Paris exhibition that one wonders a superior
were possible. For this is no truncated version of the New York show: rather
it is a substantial study, concentrated and distinct, of the young Matisse
in his early maturity, as he moved from tentative experiment to magisterial
authority. It was a transition achieved in barely ten years and, in marking
that achievement, we discover the essence of Matisse. Those who did get to
New York would not find a trip to Paris a waste of time. This is a very
different exercise.
But, the young Matisse? It is always hard to think of Matisse as ever
exactly young, and this show starts with him already 34. He had been active
in Paris some ten years, showing regularly at the Salon des Independants,
but his work was more remarkable for what we now know would come of it than
for what it was - a serious, well-ordered and strongly-modelled but somewhat
academic post-impressionism. We pick him up at Saint Tropez and back in
Paris in 1904, and still he is the creature of external influence - now of
pointillisme and colour theory, now to some extent of Gauguin. By the
following year and his trip to the south, this time to the little port of
Collioure, he is entirely his own man.
The shift may not seem over-dramatic. The colour remains clean and bright
within its comparatively limited range of reds and yellows, greens and blue,
and the brush-mark as distinct and direct as ever. But yet, but for the odd
painting of 'le port d'Abaill', that is a true throw-back to the pointillist
systems of the year before, there is a new confidence in the spirit of this
more clearly radical work, a new certainty in the statement of the image,
and a renewed simplicity in the working of the surface, no matter how rapid
or direct. A view over the roofs of Collioure and across to the far side of
the bay marks the change, with its positive, spade-like strokes of the
brush, its clarity of colour and the broad simplicity of its drawing. The
drawing is the painting: the painting is the colour: the colour is the
image. Here suddenly is the true fauve at large.
This may not be the most obvious shift in the course of Matisse's career,
but none is more significant. Through all the changes that would follow, of
interest, scale or practice, these would remain constant: the simplicity and
directness of the drawing; the simple certainty of the composition; the act
of drawing itself inseparable from the act of painting; and the authority of
colour as colour, used not as mere function of reference or record but
celebrated for what it is - black as black, red as red, green never so
green.
The 'Red Studio' of 1911 is a broad, flat, rich field of unmodulated indian
red, yet filled with space and light by the artist's own paintings on the
wall, the pile of frames in the corner, and the pots on the table. The
'Porte-fenetre' of 1914, by coincidence again at Collioure but so close in
spirit to the Paris studio paintings of earlier that year, is as simple as
any Rothko with its vertical bands, blue, grey, green and black, black as
night. Yet the space is there, and the sense of the space out in the night
beyond, and all achieved by the simple device of the narrow strip of a
darker grey that runs along to mark the floor at the angle of the open
window.
And what do we then make of Matisse? Why is he so important, so great an
artist? What is the point of him? But then to chase influences and effects
is really to miss the point, just as it would be with Titian, or Rembrandt
or Velasquez. We can only say: Matisse is simply Matisse. There he is in his
Collioure self-portrait of 1906, in his striped vest, cropped hair and full
set, looking into the glass and out at us: and there is the paint on the
surface, full and rich, and there the bold, simple line, and simple,
monumental image, oh, so deceptively simple. And why did he do such things?
Because it interested him do so, for its own sake. Look at the work.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Bleasdale clings to the ledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALAN BLEASDALE'S new play opens spectacularly at the Nottingham Playhouse
with a man suspended upside down while he attempts to paint the word
'Anarchy' high up on the outside wall of a block of apartments in Liverpool.
In fact, it comes out as 'ANACHRY' and the distortion must be deliberate.
Nothing in On the Ledge conforms to a pattern. The start could be black
comedy drawn from Orton and Ayckbourn. The end, where Liverpool appears to
go up in flames, approaches despair, but still shies away from tragedy.
Even the title is cryptic. 'On the Edge' would suggest that people might
fall over, jump or be pushed. On the Ledge shows that they just about manage
to cling on. According to a long programme note, an earlier draft of the
play was called On The Twilight Side of the Mountain. That touch of the
inchoate has never quite left it.
In moving to a shorter, simpler form, Bleasdale must still have wondered how
far to go between desperation and survival. Thus what we get is an odd mix:
half throwaway lines that could belong to a stand-up comic, half social
commentary. The set, on which the play depends, is dominant. Here is the
outside of three floors of what looks like a fairly modern municipal housing
development. There are no balconies, but ledges, where most of the action
takes place. Sometimes characters appear on the roof. There is also a
mechanical hoist which rises from the pit ready to rescue anyone in trouble.
If you wanted to go in for symbolism, the hoist represents the Liverpool
council finally arriving to prevent the worst. The one character who jumps
from the ledge, and the only one who genuinely wants to jack it all in, is
saved in this way.
Bleasdale, again according to the programme note, had considerable
difficulty in writing the piece. He sent one revised text after another to
Richard Eyre, the artistic director of the Royal National Theatre, who
repeatedly replied, with helpful comments, that it was still not right for
production. Meantime, Bleasdale was much acclaimed for the TV serial GBH:
changes were made to On the Ledge and Eyre agreed to a joint production
between the RNT and the Nottingham Playhouse.
Perhaps Eyre was too kind. One can still see why he had his reservations.
The play is all over the place. 'Look,' says one character on the roof,
'there are fires everywhere.' 'That's because it's Guy Fawkes night', says
another, which apparently it is. Is this a reflection on the Toxteth riots
in 1981? Bleasdale seems uncertain of whether he is writing a serious play.
The uncertainty extends to the characterisation. Some of the characters have
names, like Mal, the social worker with two children by different fathers,
and Moey, the man who operates the hoist. Others are simply designated as
Upside Down - the one who daubs the dyslexic version of anarchy on the wall
 -and Man-on-Ledge, the man who makes the jump. Two others are simply called
First and Second Brute. True, they are brutish, but there is no explanation
why. Then there is Shaun, who may or may not be a former prominent figure in
the Liverpool Council. His character is never developed.
There is rather a touching schoolmaster called Martin played by Christopher
Ryan, who has coupled with the social worker (Dearbhla Molloy), but again he
might just as well be a one-off turn. Man-on-Ledge, played by David Ross, is
obsessed by newspaper headlines like the one about a man who stole a British
Rail egg sandwich and was therefore thought to be insane. In short, there is
no order, no form, only what Upside Down writes as 'ANACHRY'. Possibly this
is Bleasdale's message about Liverpool today.
The set, which is the best thing about the play, is designed by William
Dudley. On the Ledge is directed by Robin Lefevre and moves to Norwich,
Glasgow, Bradford and Newcastle before arriving at the National on April 27.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Songmakers in town
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR AN all-too-brief period at the beginning of the 19th century two kindred
spirits poured out their feelings in poetry and song: John Keats and Franz
Schubert. As the composer made no song settings of the poet, there is no way
that their art can be enjoyed in harmony, but the Wigmore Hall's programme
on Tuesday did everything it could to come as close as possible.
This was the first in a short series of International Songmakers at the
Wigmore Hall, devised by Graham Johnson. By interleaving readings from
Keats's poetry and letters he gave the Schubert songs a larger dimension. So
much the two had in common - in Keats's words, the love for 'nature's gentle
doings', the romantic sensibility, the shared embrace of Grecian ideals.
This last was tellingly caught by setting Keats's Ode on a Grecian Urn
alongside Schubert's haunting 'Die Gotter Griechenlands'. (The reader
throughout was Jill Balcon.) No other music by Schubert evokes so well that
classical poise and timeless beauty, both beautifully caught in Johnson's
accompaniment, if less palpably by the Austrian baritone, Oliver Widmer.
Nevertheless, the deep resonance of his singing, unforced, generously
projected, rich in tone, every word clear, was the primary vocal pleasure of
the evening.
Whether or not it is the Wigmore's new Bosendorfer piano, Johnson is playing
better and better at the moment. The accompaniment to 'Nachthymne' sang with
a wealth of expression that the soprano Susan Gritton could not equal; that
to 'Die Sternennachte' captured more of the moonlit, silvery atmosphere than
tenor Jamie MacDougall's vocal line, sensitive though his quiet singing
always was. At forte, the tone can become unpleasing. Alongside Widmer's
eloquence in his own language, the linguistic efforts of his British
colleagues were apt to sound problematical.
*****
Earlier in the day another songmaker, by profession at least, had appeared
at Covent Garden. This was the Irish mezzo Patricia Bardon, giving one of
the Royal Opera's Tuesday lunchtime recitals. Hers is a splendidly
individual voice, mezzo in name, perhaps, but rich, deep, touching alto
depths with an old-fashioned steadiness and majesty when she wants to.
With Kathron Sturrock her fine accompanist, she tackled a varied programme
that included vivid Barber and intense Rakhmaninov. Sometimes there is a
tendency to allow the basic, distinctive colour of the voice to run unvaried
for too long, but her Hahn group found a new, quietly luminous quality for
'L'Heure exquise'. In Brahms's 'Die Mainacht' the voice showed that it could
encompass both the tender and the deeply serious. It was brave, too, to
carry on when the din of an Italian comic opera in rehearsal broke in from
the main auditorium.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Community life - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Sunday, Radio 4, determined to ease us out of the distress we must all
have felt at the Merseyside news, showed us lives of restraint. First, the
start of Goodbye to All That, where Simon Parkes visits artistic
communities. His first was Deya in Majorca, famous as the retreat of Robert
Graves. Even in its best days it was evidently not without its faults; the
poet Brian Patten recalled 'screaming drunks'. But quiet and, in those days,
hard of access.
An hour after this came In Search of Utopia, also about life in communities,
but of a different kind. Presenter Felicity Goodall dealt mainly with the
feelings of children in such places, where (at Bruderhof, for example)
child-care, meals and property are all communally organised, and no intimacy
is allowed until a couple are engaged. At Findhorn in the north of Scotland,
perhaps the oddest of the visits, there is communication not only with
plants but with fairies and elves, and this a religious foundation. It seems
to work; cabbages grow there up to 40 lb] More communities next week.
Until the end of March, Radio 3 is reviewing the arts of the 1920s. Here is
some of what is to come: archive recordings of literary grandees on their
contemporaries; popular music of the time, English, American, German and
even Russian; today's critics on new views of the then-current novelists;
Maria Jolas, wife of the founder of Transition, on Paris figures like
Picasso, Stravinsky and Joyce; a reappraisal of Aldous Huxley, with readings
of some of his stories. Last Sunday's talk by Vita Sackville-West on Orlando
and tomorrow's by Prince Antoine Bibesco on Proust make a good start. But
Radio 3 listeners who complain about too much talk will be very cross.
Fay Weldon's The Hole in the Top of the World on Radio 3 on Sunday is
basically a romantic piece. Matt, a famous scientist, studies the ozone
layer from a lab in the Antarctic with Nina, a young female scientist and
rival to his wife Simone, but Ms Weldon does not write basic pieces. Simone
thinks Matt to be in danger, not only from Nina, sharing his work and
contemplating marriage, but from 'the UVs' through the hole in the ozone.
The hole, Simone believes, is due not to CFCs but to all our illusions
breaking out into space. This theory is more interesting than Simone's trip
to the Antarctic lab with her toy-boy Andrew, soon seduced by Nina. Perhaps
it is basic, after all. The cast are all American, with Walter Matthau as
Matt, not one of his great performances. The co-production with LA Theatre
Works was recorded in Santa Monica under Shaun MacLoughlin.
On Thursday Radio 4 gave The Architect's Dream by Neil Rhodes. The dream was
to build a two-mile-high city, clearing all the neighbouring land, but
Ashley, the architect, retired first, and is now just building an extension
to his retired neighbour Eric's house. Eric's wife, Mildred, is as silly as
Ashley's wife Kay is bossy, and the two dislike one another within
neighbourly bounds. Eric, making a model of Ashley's dream, sensibly bashes
Mildred with a hammer. Disputes are forgotten when Ashley visits him in the
prison hospital. Kay and Mildred become mates too, and that's about all
there is. I thought the characters boring and the dialogue dull. Richard
Wortley directed.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Arts: Scales meets Beckett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO MOST British theatre-goers, Samuel Beckett's 1961 classic Happy Days is
an unknown quantity, whereas Prunella Scales, the latest interpreter of its
central role, is - thanks to TV - a household name. At the West Yorkshire
Playhouse's new staging, it is soon obvious that Happy Days, though Scales
can reveal just about every comic facet in it, is nothing like the various
comedies that have made her name.
Not since Aeschylus's Prometheus Bound has a protagonist been so tied to the
earth. In Act One, Winnie is up to her waist in earth; in Act Two, up to her
neck. She is not all alone. Many of her words are addressed to her enfeebled
and laconic husband Willie, though he is usually out of sight and often out
of hearing. Communication, contact, memory are ebbing. No observer could
miss the absurdity of this situation. Or the pathos of it.
Scales's Winnie is Northern, middle-class, genteel, dowdy, fading. Nothing
about her is heroic. Most of what she says she has said so often that her
voice sometimes grows flattened and monotonous from custom. Scales catches
Winnie's nervous system; and, when she gabbles, she is alarmingly real. If
anything, she over-characterises Winnie (she is nearly the flip side of
Thora Hird in Alan Bennett's Talking Heads) - gives Winnie more surface than
essence. When, for example, she says 'Ah yes, things have their life, that
is what I always say, things have a life,' you are more struck by her quaint
way of lingering on final consonants ('thinnngs') than by what she is
saying.
In general, however, she so illuminates Beckett's words that afterwards,
checking, I was amazed to note how almost every detail arose from his mind,
not hers - even the overlap of her laughter with Willie's. She has complete
ease with Winnie's constant change of mood; she is as natural speaking of
'the happy day to come when flesh melts at so many degrees', or suppressing
a sob in 'That is what I find so wonderful,' as she is when prodding Willie
with her parasol or reprimanding him for his personal habits.
In details of timing, Scales, Robin Bowerman (Willie) and their director,
Jude Kelly, do Becket proud. In two important features, however, this
staging diminishes text and play. Both concern our sense of time, and affect
the play's larger meaning. Firstly, the two acts are separated here only by
a brief scene-adjustment and pause - as Tynan recommended, after the 1962
Royal Court production. But, by doing away with an interval (the play runs
at 90 minutes), Kelly has weakened the sense of time's passing.
Secondly, the text is heavily sprinkled with pauses - 'too full of infertile
pauses,' wrote Tynan. Scales and Kelly, however, leave few pauses longer
than a breath, and leave none of them infertile. Scales's eyes and mouth are
always nervously on the move. Likewise, in Act One, her hands. The result is
rather too rushed, with little sense of waiting, of speech confronting The
Great Silence - not just Willie's silence, but the silence of heaven and
earth.
Pamela Howard's set, with scorched earth vanishing into baking sky, would be
ideal if only Winnie's mound were shaped more like a gentle cone, less like
a lump of sea-wall. Even so, Happy Days remains a masterpiece of moderist
theatre; and, in Leeds, its meanings are all present. Winnie, the ageing
breast (or mons Veneris); Willie, the ageing cock. The moods in which a
woman addresses the loss of sexual activity, sexual identity, social
colloquy, personal memory. The way that the sexes' struggle for power still
surfaces. The touching fluctuations of the human spirit while seeing dust
inexorably return to dust. Winnie to Willie: 'Just to know you are there
within hearing and conceivably on the semi-alert is . . . er . . . paradise
enow.'

THE MERMAIDS IN THE BASEMENT by Marina Warner Chatto &amp; Windus Pounds 9.99,
228 pages
A LAZY EYE by Mary Morrissey Jonathan Cape Pounds 8.99, 229 pages
SUCH DEVOTED SISTERS edited by Shena Mackay Virago Pounds 14.99, 330 pages
FROM the Queen of Sheba to My Naughty Little Sisters, a woman's social
presence has always been different from a man's. Art through the ages has
confirmed it - all those classical nudes begging to be looked at, flattering
their male owners; literature has mostly maintained stereotypes. Here are
three outstanding volumes of stories which, through the oblique but
penetrating truths of fiction, say much about the gap between women as
perceived and perceivers, as helpless icons and as creators of their own
imaginative worlds.
We know Marina Warner as a distinguished cultural historian of female
archetypes in biblical and folk tales; in The Mermaids in the Basement she
turns her talents inside out and, in a series of dazzling monologues,
imagines updated versions of the familiar figures speaking for themselves.
It is not quite the Virgin Mary as Molly Bloom, but here is modern Kate as
the Pharoah's daughter finding a baby in a basket, Susannah (she of the
'Elders') spied upon by her husband's property developer colleagues in a
poolside villa, Martha buying tortellini and frozen blueberries and washing
up for Mary as she realises, after years of housewifely devotion, that she
hates her sister.
Warner's skill is to free her characters from the archetypal expectations
that have hung on them for centuries and yet to use the very resonance from
these myths to surprise and enchant anew. In 'The First Time' she alternates
a comic pop rhythm from the Serpent, who has 'diversified' into selling
tropical fruit at a supermarket, with the little-girl-lost floodgates of a
lovelorn teenager who goes home with guavas, tamarillos and 13p change. The
best story, 'Be My Baby', is an elaboration on nun-ish wisdom - 'Sister
Richard used to say the nun's was the highest calling, but that motherhood
wasn't far behind' - through the superb, salt-of-the-earth Cockney
vernacular of a nurse turned child-snatcher.
Sensuous yet rigidly controlled, dallying with everyday banalities but
stopping just short of cliche, darting erudite reference into imaginative
empathy, Warner writes with the delicious delicacy of a tightrope walker. In
her last novel, Indigo, the attempt to pull myth into fiction read like a
top-heavy academic joke, but in the short story, it seems to me, Warner has
found her milieu. The form enables her to spin out from one rich image or
archetype into an original view of the world, and to convey it in a
lyrical/tough style which does not sink under the weight of its own
analysis. The result is exhilarating.
In fictional technique, the Irish writer Mary Morrissey could not be more
different from Warner. The heroines of A Lazy Eye are anonymous,
back-of-the-woods women whom we see for just fleeting moments of sheer,
humiliating physicality - the start of menstruation, which gets a young
traveller thrown off a European sleeper train; a woman revealing an
embarrassing discharge to a hardnosed doctor. Storylines are slim, abrupt,
almost proudly inconsequential; a throw-away, breathless prose rushes
headlong, then smashes into deliberate flatness. Yet each of Morrissey's
women manages, within events of a few minutes or hours, to encompass two
worlds: one of guilty oppression (the interior of the train or surgery,
controlled by the conductor or doctor), the other a wild, macabre landscape
of the mind to which this claustrophobia gives rise.
There is the daughter, bargaining in hospital with God to save her father
and let a youth in the next ward die instead, who is so intoxicated by her
inner reality that she feels as guilty as a murderer. There is the
shoplifter who remains loftily above her accusers when she is distracted and
caught by a half-caste child who reminds her of the black babies the nuns
once taught her to pray for. With artistry and warmth, Morrissey gives her
characters a language as distinct as Warner's; people whom we might glimpse
and pigeon-hole daily become atypical, particularised as quirky individuals
standing up for themselves in a vengeful world.
The fascination of Virago's new anthology of women's writing on sisterhood,
Such Devoted Sisters, lies in the parallels between pieces written in five
continents over almost two centuries. Some of the finest, and most familiar,
extracts here are thus illumined: Janet Frame's 'Keel and Kool', for
example, a restrained yet vivid picture of a Christmas picnic in New Zealand
where a child works out her response to the death of a sister, has emotional
echoes of the sentimental, closed-in scene of Beth's death from Louisa
Alcott's Good Wives.
Shena Mackay has had a plentiful sea to trawl from, and her choice includes
some stories which are perfect examples of the form, often from writers
better known as novelists. Edna O'Brien's 'The Connor Girls', where a
child's view of two adult sisters and their romances changes painfully as
she grows up, has the intensity and yearning nostalgia of The Go-Between
condensed into 20 pages. Mary Flanagan's tale of sisterly bullying unravels
like a horror movie. If there is an integrating theme, it is the
innocence-to-experience story, with the particularly female twist of
breaking away from family and social assumptions into self-knowledge and
liberated identity. It is a welcome showcase for both women's writing and
the short story.

GILBERT AND SULLIVAN by Michael Ffinch Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 20, 294
pages
PENDING the archival biography of WS Gilbert himself on which an American
theatre historian has been busying herself for a decade, here is yet another
of those general books which from time to time re-scrutinise the Victorian
collaboration. Smoothly written, Michael Ffinch's text incorporates a
re-telling of the stories of the operettas and lengthy quotation from their
verses. He is in no doubt that the dramatist was 'a far greater man in every
way' than the composer.
Such a judgment, however, assumes a musical competence not evident in an
author who asserts that the title of Ruddigore 'is now often confused with
Verdi's Rigoletto'. The profusion of superscript figures and footnotes (or
rather back-notes) is, alas, a facade. With no scholarly evaluation of his
sources, Mr Ffinch reinstates a discredited anecdote on one page, yet cites
in another context the later work which did the discrediting.
The fictional stories that Sullivan's grandfather rose to the army rank of
sergeant and guarded Napoleon's heart on St Helena, and that Arthur Sullivan
himself as a boy chorister sang at the christening of the Duke of Albany
(Queen Victoria's youngest son) should have been nailed up for ever. On the
other hand, the author has failed to catch up with recent discoveries about
Thespis, Gilbert and Sullivan's first, 'lost' joint work.
Repeatedly misnaming a character in The Grand Duke as 'Drummkopf' instead of
'Dummkopf', Mr Ffinch fails to perceive Gilbert's German joke. The misnaming
of one of Sullivan's non-Gilbert operettas as Hadden (for Haddon) Hall and
the misquotation from Trial by Jury likewise betray an uncertain foothold on
the terrain. The nineteen photo-illustrations are well chosen.

THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE by Edward O Wilson Allen Lane Pounds 22.50, 424 pages
TAXONOMY has always seemed one of the most comforting and rewarding of
biological disciplines. Anyone who has marvelled at the variation in a mass
of bee orchids on a Mediterranean hillside, or attempted to distinguish
between the small brown flycatchers that throng through an American
woodland, will have had a small taste of the challenges in assigning
individuals to species and subspecies, in fixing boundaries for what is
often a continuum of life forms.
The taxonomist's mill grinds ever smaller; more and more sophisticated tools
are brought to bear on the most difficult knots of classification, always
striving to mirror the precision with which evolution remorselessly sifts
and orders its own production. The goal of this effort is far removed from
the reality of a dusty herbarium or a formalin-pickled specimen; behind it
all there's an intellectual challenge which in its own way is as elemental
as any research in particle physics or creation cosmology.
Now, as Edward Wilson demonstrates, taxonomy is big news. Wilson is an
entomologist, an ant-man whose work on the species of the tropical
rainforest has led him on to contemplate the larger pattern into which his
classification fits. Species diversity, the range of living organisms to be
found within a single habitat, is at its most luxuriant in the rainforest;
there the niches into which animals and plants can adapt themselves are
narrower and more ingenious than anywhere else on earth. And what we know of
that range of species is still only a partial picture of life on earth; what
has been named and classified - perhaps 1.5m species altogether - is still
only a small fraction of the total waiting to be recorded, for which
estimates range up towards 100m.
In the face of this uncountable profusion, man has set about winnowing it
with an effectiveness unparalleled in the history of life on earth. There
have been mass extinctions before; the fossil record shows them punctuating
geological time. But none threatens to be as comprehensive and savage as the
one currently being meted out by one species on its fellows. Yes, the earth
will probably make up the loss eventually, as it has always done before, but
only after tens of millions of years, when the human race itself may well
have joined the 99 per cent of the species that have once existed and are
already extinct.
Wilson unfolds this litany of disaster in an even, cool tone. First he
celebrates the glories of bio-diversity, then painstakingly chronicles the
human race's efforts to destroy it. His remedies, the ways in which habitats
might be saved, demands for food and material production reconciled with the
need to maintain diversity, are persuasively argued. It would be easy to
allow a note of hysteria to creep in, to turn the agenda which Wilson
presents in his final chapter into an emotional polemic. But the facts are
always allowed to speak for themselves; in the final analysis, he concludes,
what happens to the planet is an ethical decision for the human race: 'The
stewardship of environment is a domain on the near side of metaphysics where
all reflective persons can surely find common ground . . . An enduring
environmental ethic will aim to preserve not only the health and freedom of
our species, but access to the world in which the human spirit was born.'
Sometimes repetitive, and encumbered by distinctly inappropriate line
illustrations this is an important book. It takes the whole environmental
issue on to a higher plane; more than the greenhouse effect or ozone
depletion, it is habitat destruction that will affect the planet and the
ecology which humans share with their congeners for as long as the race
survives. 'One earth, one experiment', Wilson warns, and it is up to us
whether we choose to pull the plug.

CHURCHILL: A MAJOR NEW ASSESSMENT OF HIS LIFE IN PEACE AND WAR edited by
Robert Blake and W M Louis Oxford Pounds 19.95, 581 pages
CHURCHILL, THE END OF GLORY by John Charmley Hodder &amp; Stoughton Pounds 30,
742 pages
CHURCHILL quipped: 'History will bear me out,particularly as I shall write
that history myself'. While the old lion may have wanted the first word, he
must have known it would not be the last. Churchill: A Major New Assessment
is a glittering collection of essays by a distinguished cast of historians,
mainly British, without a continental (or woman) in sight. It is guaranteed
to be a scholarly bestseller. There is hardly a contribution (each
restricted to some 20 pages, and splendidly cross-referenced) that does not
contain a golden nugget or a suggestive idea.
This deconstruction of Churchill's political life is revisionist history at
its very best. A nuanced introduction and a beautifully written final essay
by Robert Rhodes James on the 'parliamentarian, orator and statesman' point
to the central paradox in any assessment of Churchill's career. In 1939
Churchill was 65 years of age. The man for whom politics was a central
passion had been out of office for 10 years and, excepting the Liberal
reform years of 1909-11, his career might well have been dismissed as a
study in failure. He could have been consigned to David Cannadine's list of
Marlboroughs distinguished by too many debts, too much gambling and too much
drink. Yet in 1940 Churchill's faults became virtues and, despite costly
mistakes and terrible misjudgments, he emerged from the war as one of the
greatest statesmen of our time, the only one of the three war leaders to
retain almost untarnished his claim to greatness.
Even Churchill's greatest strength, the masterly ability to use words in a
way few could match, stemmed not from a natural facility of speech but from
preparation of the most detailed kind. The effect of his rhetoric in the
inter-war period was to make enemies in the Commons and to be judged boring,
repetitive and prejudiced by his political peers. It was in 1940, with the
brief but unforgettable 'blood, toil, tears and sweat' speech that man and
moment matched. It is hard to believe that in that year, as DJ Wendon
records, only five of Churchill's speeches were broadcast to the nation, for
the prime minister's oratorical skills lay at the very heart of his
mobilisation of the nation. The aristocrat by birth, who had probably never
travelled on a bus, became the people's hero.
Churchill's egotism and driving ambition did not make political friends. His
lifelong faith in the greatness of Britain and the strength of her empire
already seemed archaic and dangerously romantic in the inter-war period.
Beyond this constancy of belief, Churchill was a mass of contradictions,
shifting between parties and policies with unacceptable frequency. Writer
after writer in this collection, with but one or two exceptions, exposes the
gap between the image and the reality of his achievements - the creation of
the Anglo-American 'special relationship', the bulldog stance of 1940, the
prescient 'cold warrior' of the Stalinist period, and the great 'European'
of the Zurich speech.
In one of the few contributions which singles out Churchill's permanence of
vision, Paul Addison points to the element of paternalism which coloured his
attitude towards social reform. In many ways, Churchill remained faithful to
the precepts of his Edwardian inheritance; in others, he was the supreme
realist and pragmatist.
In the most passionate critique of Churchill's policies, Sarvepalli Gopal
argues that India was and remained Churchill's blind spot and that his
visceral dislike of Gandhi, Congress and at times all Indians, brought out
the harshness and cruelty in his nature. Yet even here there was an element
of realism. Once India went, he knew that the empire and the main source of
British power would disappear. Elsewhere in the Empire, he looked to
compromise and reconciliation. Churchill was a man of prejudices and
preferences but, with the exception of India and a dangerous
under-estimation of the Japanese, these rarely blinded him to the needs of
the moment.
Apart from John Keegan, who makes a case for Churchill's Mediterranean
strategy, other writers on military matters dwell on his failures.
Churchill's passionate interest in war and the tools of war was a
double-edged sword. The restless craving for action, the mania for capturing
islands and the 'ceaseless prodding' of generals and admirals often resulted
in disaster. Churchill's fascination with science and technology, as
illustrated by RV Jones, and his unusual and all-important interest in
intelligence were key actors in Britain's victory. Sir Harry Hinsley,
however, argues that it was in reaction to the prime minister's use of the
Bletchley decripts that a proper system of assessment and use was developed.
Churchill could inspire men and energise Whitehall but he was also a notable
bully. Only a few, Alan Brooke and Montgomery the most notable among them,
could withstand his formidable tongue. The strongest indictment of Churchill
as strategist and war leader comes from Richard Ollard's discussion of the
Navy, for not only did Churchill never grasp the nature of sea power but he
never appreciated the quality of the men who served him. This may strike
many general readers as the most surprising argument in the collection.
Even in 1940 Churchill's stance was not quite what it seemed. As shown by
Robert Blake and David Reynolds, Churchill came to the prime ministership by
default. His political weakness meant that he had to consider the
possibility of peace in the terrible month of May. David Reynolds draws back
the Churchillian curtain to reveal a more complicated story than that found
in Churchill's own account. Nevertheless there is little doubt that the
prime minister's decision for continuing the war and his ability to
galvanise the nation behind him created an unforgettable kinship between the
man and the people. Archaic ideas expressed in glorious prose created 'their
finest hour'. Apart from his self confidence and faith in the nation,
Churchill had only his belief in America's entrance into the war and a
mistaken impression of German weakness to back his resolve.
Twenty-nine essays do not create a composite picture and no one here quite
tackles the reasons why, after all the mistakes are revealed, Churchill
emerges with his 'integrity and greatness' intact. It is because John
Charmley has cast doubt on the Churchillian decision taken in 1940 that he
has incurred the wrath of so many historians. He fully deserves his moment
of notoriety. This book is full of interest and important insights. He makes
useful connections, between for instance, Churchill's stubborness over India
and his determination to fight on in 1940.
Charmley clearly enjoyed writing this book and this shows on almost every
page. But his central thesis is fatally flawed. Churchill was not
responsible for the fall of the British empire, nor can he be blamed for the
country's decline from power. He did, at a crucial moment, mainly through
force of personality, avoid linking Britain with Nazi Germany. This saved
his fellow countrymen from having to make unacceptable decisions. Ask any
Frenchman over the age of 60. It was the right choice and one which will
never be forgotten. The Marlborough genes finally turned up trumps. But of
the making of Churchill books there shall be no end.

PERSONAL WITNESS: ISRAEL THROUGH MY EYES by Abba Eban Jonathan Cape Pounds
25, 671 pages
TEMPERAMENTALLY, Abba Eban never quite fitted into Israeli politics,
although he was at its centre from the country's birth. Donnish, remote,
supremely articulate, his precise grandiloquent style jarred against the
untidy, reflexive mode characteristic of Israelis.
He here recalls how Harold Wilson once suggested that he lacked a killer's
instinct in politics - surely an unfair judgment, since in the arena of
international diplomacy, where he excelled, Eban frequently demonstrated
that instinct to telling effect. His problem was not a deficiency in
ruthlessness so much as a lack of suitable armoury for the rough and tumble
of Israeli politics, which favours the bludgeon above the rapier. He seems
to be seduced by the cadence of language and intellectual symmetry to the
point of being oblivious to the gut sensibilities of his public.
This book describes a long, distinguished career in Israeli public life,
from initiation into the high echelons of pre-state Zionist politics at the
precocious age of 22, to the retired eminence that he has been enjoying for
a number of years now. Born in South Africa and raised in this country, he
gave up a promising academic life in Cambridge to live in and serve the
emerging Jewish state. He was Israel's first ambassador to the United
Nations and Washington, Foreign Minister, Minister of Education, and Deputy
Prime Minister.
As might be expected, his elevated view of the country's evolution allied to
meticulous recall guarantees that his account is authoritative and
comprehensive. Yet something about the assured flow of his narrative
suggests a selective retrospection, with an element of score-settling and
self-vindication in mind.
Mr Eban's invaluable contribution to Israel's struggle has been in
diplomacy, and the parts of the book which deal with his years as Israel's
envoy to the UN and to Washington are the most exciting. It is here that the
eloquence of his prose complements his incisive sense of irony. Few of his
contemporaries on the diplomatic circuit could show such an assured grasp of
world affairs. Fewer still had the gift of summing up a complex situation as
lucidly and concisely as he could.
The Suez crisis tested his abilities to the full. He came through, as in
subsequent crises, with flying colours. The esteem in which he was held by
statesmen who were not renowned for their affection for Israel is
illustrated by one of his encounters with the then American Secretary of
State, John Foster Dulles. In early November 1956 Eban made a crucial speech
to the UN General Assembly: 'It was past 2.00 in the morning when the vote
came . . . As I walked down to the lobby, Dulles was waiting there . . . he
began to speak with typically forensic professionalism: 'Listen, you didn't
seem to be reading. Did you have a manuscript?' I told him that, owing to
pressure of time, I had not prepared my speech at all . . . He looked at me
hard and offered a memorable tribute: 'Jesus Christ,' he said, as he stalked
away. I was later told that this was the only occasion on which that austere
churchman had been heard to utter the familiar but irreverent expletive.'
Unfortunately, Eban was never fully appreciated in Israel. Perhaps the
reason is that his moderation flowed from an alien rationality. His book,
rich in insights, resonant in language, is the story of the Jewish state
told by a Cicero, not a Thucydides.

LYDDIE by Katherine Paterson Puffin Paperback Pounds 3.50, 182 pages
THIRTEEN-year-old Lyddie Worthen had been queen in all but name of the poor
cabin, the straggly fields and the sugar bush up in the hills of Vermont;
but when she descends to the plain to begin work as a poorly-paid kitchen
help at Cutler's Tavern after her father disappears Out West and her mother,
in the grip of a religious obsession, takes herself and the babies off to
evangelical Uncle Judah's house, despair seems to stare Lyddie in the face.
Why has her mother allowed the family to be split asunder in this way? And
what can she, a poor, untutored girl, do to bring it back together again?
The answer seems relatively simple: pay off the farm's debts.
After working in the tavern's gargantuan kitchens she drifts down to Lowell,
Massachusetts, in pursuit of better paid work in the mills; and the account
that Maryland novelist Katherine Paterson gives us of factory life in the
1840s in this novel could not be more different from the version provided by
Charles Dickens in his American Notes of 1842 - a book that was received
with great hostility by his hosts for, among other things, its harsh
condemnation of slavery and its advocacy of international copyright.
Lyddie earns a good living in the mill, working like a demon to pay off the
debts of the farm so that, one day, she might return home. Envious of her
friend Betsy's bookishness, she acquires a fine edition of Oliver Twist and
teaches herself to read by copying out individual pages and pasting them to
her loom. But she also remains a perpetual outsider, a crow among peacocks,
in her tight homespun and the pinching, overlarge boots, speaking, as she
does, her queer mountain speech.
Unfortunately, the very yearning to earn enough money to liberate herself
turns her into a different kind of person - tough, miserly, impatient with
those weaker and slower than herself. Her mind becomes as calloused as her
hands. And then the devastating news arrives: her mother is dead; her
brother has found a surrogate family; and the farm has been sold. There is
nothing and no one to return to. The farm now exists only in Lyddie's
excitable imagination.
Katherine Paterson has won many awards for her success in writing about
children and teenagers pitting themselves against terrible odds - the
struggles of Jess in Bridge To Tarabithia (1977), for example; or the
efforts of an older sister in the Newbery Medal winner Jacob Have I Loved
(1980) to establish an independent life for herself when she has always
lived in the shadow of a younger favourite. But Lyddie is much more than a
piece of convincing portraiture. It is both a meticulously researched
historical novel that illuminates the conditions of life in an American
industrial town of the 1840s, and an exploration of themes that have been
written about too seldom in fiction for young people: whether or not work
itself is a kind of enslavement; the plea bargaining that must go on between
the need to improve one's working conditions and the very human wish not to
be taken for a troublemaker; and sexual harassment in the workplace.
These are mature themes - but they impinge upon the lives of children too,
and Katherine Paterson has worked them into this novel with such skill that
they have become an integral part of this excellently-told and well-paced
story.
American novelists have often demonstrated a rare ability to write about
difficult, spunky children - among the best are Vera and Bill Cleaver, SE
Hinton, Paula Fox, and even, perhaps, J D Salinger. Katherine Paterson has
created something as good as anything that the others might have conceived
in the person of the sturdy, plain Lyddie, a little chip of Vermont.

forever versatile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AC GRAYLING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HISTORY OF GOD by Karen Armstrong Heinemann Pounds 16.99, 511 pages
A NICE temerity attaches to the title of Karen Armstrong's book, for God
allegedly exists outside time and therefore, like the virtuous woman of
parable, has no history. But Armstrong has not attempted a history of God,
but of mankind's idea of God; or rather of mankind's many ideas of God. For
the concept of deity is protean, and readily assumes the shapes into which
history's pressures squeeze humanity's needs.
Armstrong was once a Roman Catholic nun, and wrote a bestselling account of
her loss of faith and return to secular life. Since then she has made a
profession of her somewhat ambiguous agnosticism, as an eloquent journalist
of religion who is sympathetic to its attractions but sceptical of its
claims. The ambiguity of her agnosticism arises from her preparedness to
give house-room to thinkers as different as the medieval Meister Eckhart and
the modern Ivan Tillich, who cannot accept literal God-with-a-white-beard
theologies, but who believe there is some sort of Absolute nevertheless; and
who hide its indescribability behind a fig-leaf of paradox.
In this ambitious book Armstrong traces the history of Jewish, Christian and
Islamic concepts of God from their beginnings to the present. This is a vast
subject, demanding a wide range of scholarly skills. Only a tome compiled by
specialists would be truly adequate, and Armstrong's single-handed attempt
cannot claim to be so. She ventures Old Testament scholarship, classical
philology, Islamic history, modern philosophy, and much besides; but by the
end her exposition has become a series of vignettes, a couple of pages each
to this thinker or that topic, betraying heavy reliance on second-hand
material, and exposing Armstrong in waters beyond her depth.
But this is a commendable book nevertheless, and an interesting one, and I
would rather it were widely read than not, for it says something important.
Drawing on her own experience, Armstrong remarks that most people acquire
confused ideas about religion in childhood, and thereafter neither modify
nor develop them. But as soon as we realise that theologies are the product
of history, during which barely recognisable versions of our own culture's
beliefs have variously flourished and failed, we come to see religion in a
markedly different light.
It must, for example, strike even desultory readers of the Old Testament
that the tribal god it depicts is a bully and a tyrant. The contrast with
the New Testament's avuncular deity is striking. But what readers might not
know is that some biblical texts have a decidedly questionable history.
Consider Deuteronomy, which, in the midst of yet another doctrinal quarrel
within Israel, was suddenly and conveniently 'found' by workmen refurbishing
the Temple - and of course gave unequivocal support to one side of the
argument. Yahweh often entered on cue like this, apparently unable to resist
politics; and invariably on the winning side.
Jesus's divinity affords another example. In Mark's Gospel he is a man; in
the theology of St Paul he is the medium of the New Covenant; in the fourth
century AD, after the Arian 'heresy' controversy - Arius of Alexandria had
argued that Jesus must be less divine than the Father - he becomes very God
in human form.
One of the book's most fascinating chapters concerns the rise of Islam,
which Armstrong tells us resulted from an Arabic sense of inferiority.
Arabs, she says, felt 'mingled resentment and respect' for Jews and
Christians because they had enjoyed direct communication with God. Leaders
like Zayd ibn Amr longed for their own people to receive a divine
revelation. It came at last to Muhammad ibn Abdallah in a terrifying
experience on Mount Hira outside Mecca, in which the angel Gabriel
instructed him to 'Recite]'
The result, produced at laborious intervals over the following two decades,
was the Koran, the 'Recitation', whose sheer beauty of language is reputed
to have been a frequent instrument of conversion in its own right. But, as
with Christianity, splits and controversies followed, and Islam's early
tolerance towards other religions soon vanished, as did the early freedoms
enjoyed by its women. And again as with Christianity, the long-term legacy
includes the familiar horrors of intolerance, bigotry and persecution which
characterise all organised religion.
The concept of God, Armstrong shows, is a gerrymandered affair. But she
insists nevertheless that humans are spiritual creatures, and tentatively
wonders whether the new theologies of Tillich, Martin Buber and others might
meet our cravings for something ultimate. She is right to say that
spirituality matters; but some of us would argue that only art and affection
can appease its hungers. Her book therefore suggests a different solution.
Rather than seek another new definition of God, we might do better to
dispense with theologies altogether and place our hopes in the best of
things human instead.

FT  27 FEB 93 / As they say in Europe: Try to understand John Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WAS riveted by the phrase, 'We must condemn a little more and understand a
little less.' The prime minister, John Major, uttered it in a newspaper
interview last Sunday when asked about the wave of violent crime in which
Britain is at present engulfed, as is demonstrated by everything except the
evidence.
The phrase finds only a limited echo elsewhere in Europe. In French it
becomes the conclusion of the syllogism whose first premiss is the
well-known saying, 'Tout expliquer, c'est tout comprendre.' It goes nicely
into German: 'Mehr Verurteilen, weniger Verstandnis.' That could easily
appear on the masthead of the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a paper which
constantly puts Major's injunction into practice. This week saw a nice
round-up of the usual suspects - those phenomena which threaten civilised
existence - Serbs, social- democrats and cuts in interest rates.
And yet in a country that many still associate with strict attitudes towards
deviant behaviour, the punishment of violent crime in particular seems, by
comparison with Britain, astonishingly lax. When four youths beat an Angolan
guestworker to death in the eastern German city of Eberswalde last year,
they got a maximum of four years apiece in jail: Die Welt described the
sentences as 'heavy.' Maybe this gives force to the views of a German friend
of mine who once said: 'In this country you can get with murder, but very
little else.'
Moscow's Sovetskaya Rossiya provides the ultimate realisation of Major's
advice. As its anachronistic name implies, it manages to condemn everything
and understand absolutely nothing. This week it produced a memorable piece
on the 'purposeful wrecking of the army and navy in every respect by the top
military-political leadership of the country.'
But most of the great newspapers of Europe, the Neue Zurcher Zeitung, Le
Monde, El Pais and so on, get the phrase the other way round and hesitate to
criticise anything. They tend to be depressingly fair-minded and objective,
giving long explanations of the background to evil events and, as a result,
are, in a word, boring. Nobody ever went out to lynch someone after reading
the Neue Zurcher.
Major's injunction was not translated in the Spanish and Italian papers I
saw. Their journalists worked their way around it because, by itself, its
meaning was hard to grasp in their languages.
In Italy the phrase which has become derided as the ultimate expression of
ludicrous liberalism in Britain, 'we are all guilty,' becomes the basis of
the penal system. Any number of psychiatrists earn their living tramping
through the courts explaining how the criminal is the victim. But Italy, of
course, is perhaps the one country where 'we are all guilty' is probably
nothing more than a statement of fact. If you are not on the take, you are
letting your family down.
And yet, in spite of its unique qualities, Italy remains the most
under-reported country in western Europe. Pope-and-mafia stories provide the
staple for most papers and the country is condemned without being understood
almost everywhere, as it always has been. The Frankfurter Allgemeine had
another go this week at highlighting the sufferings of the German-speaking
majority of South Tyrol region: 'The Italians cannot bring themselves to
accept the German origin of local place-names.'
An English traveller in the 15th century described Italy as 'a paradise
inhabited with devils.' Even the present spectacular round of arrests, a
cabinet reshuffle and the incipient collapse of the state evoke only limited
interest among the European reading public: in Italy nothing is surprising.
As Shakespeare discovered four centuries ago, if you want to someone to
believe the impossible, you set it in Italy.
Britain seems far more interesting to most of its neighbours and it is
coming to play a role as a sort of super-Italy. Others seem to have accepted
the British evaluation of their country as an almost mythic land where not
only can things be expected to go spectacularly wrong but where they can
become exceptionally nasty too. The most recent horror to strike Liverpool,
a city which has gained a notable reputation throughout Europe as the
ultimate symbol of what it means to be British, was discussed in a number of
editorials.
The other Frankfurt paper, the Rundschau wrote: 'The insecurity which has
gripped the British because of this terrible story has another side.
Fourteen years of Tory rule have much to do with it - the ideology of a
callous individualism which has no need to recognise such realities as
poverty and social hopelessness.' Now, was that written by someone who knows
how to condemn more and understand less, or vice versa?

FT  27 FEB 93 / Gardening: How to defend the city tree - The vexed question
of Tree v. Neighbour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE coming of spring, one person's tree becomes another person's
nuisance. My introduction to the fraught area of Tree v. Neighbour came a
few months ago.
A majestic plane tree grows at the bottom of the north London back garden
overlooked by our flat. In summer, its branches make a curtain so tall and
wide that it screens not just our five-storey house but several others from
those opposite. One might have thought such a beautiful tree would have been
universally popular - but no. A member of the local conservation committee
spotted that the council had granted an application for drastic pruning.
The applicant was not the tree's owner, but a developer with a garden flat
across the wall who presumably hopes to recoup his investment quicker by
claiming the flat 'benefits from a sunny garden.'
Anguished calls to the council planners brought bad news. Several of the
plane tree's largest branches lean out above the applicant's garden, albeit
at a great height. We were told that although our tree has the statutory
protection of growing in a conservation area, these overhanging branches
constitute a nuisance. In common law, the developer has the right to wield
the axe even if it leaves a butchered tree. Sobered by this discovery, I
travelled south to discuss the troubled life of the inner-city tree with
Paul Akers, chief arboricultural officer for Westminster City Council.
Compared with trees officers in other London boroughs, Akers has a palmy
time. Westminster is Conservative and wealthy. Most of its eight acres is a
conservation area, meaning most trees are statutorily protected. Westminster
residents are generally the types to favour a greener borough. A Citizens'
Task Force reports any pruning which may be unauthorised as well as damaged
council trees. There is little vandalism. New plantings achieve a 95 per
cent 'take'.
A free advisory service exists for Westminster residents with problems about
trees - not only those in public places but in their own or other people's
gardens. Free booklets are on offer.
In cases of tree versus resident, trees officers face tricky situations and
trees can be the losers. Residents complain that lime trees along the street
drop sticky mess on their cars or that crab-apples are splattering the
pavements. 'The council cannot ignore the complaint, yet we don't want to
over-react.'
Complaints about trees cutting out light are common and pose problems
because they are so subjective. Even though it goes against the grain, Akers
will often recommend that trees causing a nuisance are pruned. It may appear
butchery to the tree-lover, but inside an overshadowed property there may be
someone who is house-bound.
People often need warning that pruning can be counter-productive, thanks to
trees' fantastic powers of regeneration which results in still denser
foliage. Trees officers will also often advise that overcrowded sites should
be thinned, although they may well suggest that young ones are planted for
the future.
In the matter of our plane tree, Akers considered that the legal position
was less black-and-white than our own planning department (too short-staffed
to visit the site) had ruled. There is 'a conflict of legal views' about
what happens when a tree in a conservation area or protected by a Tree
Preservation Order (TPO) overhangs a boundary.
I was given a further booklet, Trees and the Law by JGS Harris (Pounds 3.50,
obtainable from the Arboricultural Association*). It covers the law only as
it stood at August 11989, and will be updated. However, a case is cited in
which a court ruled that someone was wrong to have lopped overhanging
branches off a tree protected by a TPO because he had 'only suffered a small
inconvenience in the use and enjoyment of his garden' and the nuisance was
not therefore actionable.
What exactly is the value of a Tree Preservation Order (TPO), I asked? A TPO
will be placed on a tree which is beautiful or important, perhaps because it
screens an eyesore; normally it should be visible from a public place. In
Westminster, this means that virtually any front garden tree has a TPO, and
most in back gardens as well.
One can apply for a TPO, which costs nothing. Once a TPO is applied, a tree
cannot be cut at all without the prior consent of the council. (Fruit trees
are not normally given TPOs because they require heavy pruning.) Cutting and
pruning must be carried out according to British Standard regulations.
A TPO is registered as a charge on the property. Contravening a TPO can
result in a Pounds 2,000 fine. If permission is granted for a protected tree
to be felled, perhaps because it is old or diseased, the owner will be
instructed to plant a replacement. Whether they actually do is a different
matter, and planners do not necessarily have the resources to check.
Akers points out that many fights over urban trees need not occur if
suitable species had been chosen in the first place. Gardeners always need
to think of the ultimate height and spread of a tree. It makes sense not to
plant trees hard up against a boundary. And even if the tree is not be
placed so that it overhangs, Trees and the Law states that if you obscure a
neighbour's light he may be able to get an injunction ordering the trees to
be kept under control, or he may claim damages.
But if such considerations mean that the inner-city tree must always be a
small, sparse-leaved specimen, then we are surely all losers. Our graceful
giant is still some way off coming into leaf and the developer has gone
quiet, perhaps taken aback by the strength of local feeling. Or could it be
that he, too, has heard the ominous words about a conflict of legal opinion?
Conflict equals expense, and our green curtain might look a little too
costly to tear down.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Property: So nice to be beside the seaside - Water views
remain a big selling point
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARINE Drive at Barton-on-Sea, Hampshire, is the typical seaside address on
the south coast of England. It began in the 1930s as ribbon development
along the clifftop road between Lymington and Bournemouth, filling the gap
between Old Milton and New Milton with houses and bungalows enjoying views
across Christchurch Bay and the Solent to the Needles in the east and Old
Harry rocks in the west.
There are always houses for sale here at the best of times, but these days
there are more than usual, often placed with more than one agent in the hope
of attracting more interest. One such is 7 Marine Drive, built recently in
what the owner calls the 'English Riviera style,' with white stuccoed walls,
round-headed windows and red-tiled roofs. This five-bedroom home is on offer
at Pounds 295,000 through Lane Fox's Bournemouth office (tel: 0202-557 766)
and the New Milton office of Murray &amp; Morris (0425-638 656).
A few doors away, at 12 Marine Drive, is one of the original 1930s'
properties. Mullion Cottage is a four-bedroom, tile-hung house for which
Murray &amp; Morris is asking Pounds 299,000.
The same agent has several other houses on its books in Marine Drive and its
extensions east and west, including one five-bedroom property in Marine
Drive West that has just been repossessed for the second time in 18 months.
At Pounds 175,000, it is clearly the bargain of Barton.
'The second-home market dried up in 1988, but the cachet of a sea view has
held good right through the recession,' says M&amp;M's James Murray. 'The
greater supply means that a purchaser can pick up a good buy when it comes
round. At Marine Prospect, a new development on the site of the Red House
Hotel, two-bedroom flats start at Pounds 65,000.'
Stephen Noble, of Lane Fox, agrees about the importance of sea views, but
adds: 'Many flats and houses in Bournemouth are now changing hands at
figures that are, in some cases, half what they were at the peak.'
Some of the best houses in Bournemouth were built on the Cooper-Dean estate
on the West Cliff. Many of these have been converted into flats but one of
the original houses, built in 1910, survives: Strath Avon, in West Overcliff
Drive, now a comfortable four-bedroom house with two self-contained flats
for staff, family or visitors. Offers of Pounds 595,000 are being invited by
Lane Fox and the Wimborne office of Savills (0202-887 331).
Poole is to Bournemouth what Hove is to Brighton - the quieter resort. One
of the best addresses in Poole is Sandbanks, a peninsula dividing the
harbour from Poole bay where the Bournemouth office of Savills (0202-298
585) has what it calls 'marine residences' at prices up to Pounds 1m.
Another good address is Canford Cliffs, where Savills has a three-bedroom
bungalow at Pounds 395,000. Lane Fox and Savills also are agents for
Saltings, a new development on the clifftop in Cliff Drive, where three-
bedroom flats are for sale from Pounds 235,000-285,000.
In the Lymington area, some of the most expensive properties are being
offered by Paul Jackson (0590-674 411). He is asking Pounds 595,000 for the
five-bedroom Lea House, in seven acres, which was on the market at Pounds
900,000 in 1991 and has views across the Solent to the Isle of Wight.
At Old Bosham, in West Sussex, unsuspecting motorists who park on the front
and return to find the water lapping around their car soon discover that
this is where King Canute failed to command the waves. One of the
four-bedroom modernised fishermen's cottages in Mariners Terrace is for sale
at Pounds 180,000 through Henry Adams &amp; Partners, of Chichester (0243-533
377).
Richard Etherington, an unconventional agent at Petworth (07985-222),
publishes a chatty newsletter called The Nibbler in which he detects 'some
small sign of recovery in the market' with buyers competing against each
other again. If this is so, can gazumping be far away?
He is offering a four-bedroom house at the end of a cul-de-sac close to the
beach on the private Middleton estate at Middleton-on-Sea, near King George
V's recuperative Bognor Regis. Built in the 1920s, but extended and
modernised by the owners, Etherington says it is 'priced to sell' at Pounds
245,000.
There are seaside properties for sale all over Britain. A computer search by
Bedrock International (071-351 2625), an up-market new agency in Chelsea
that acts for buyers, produced 46 coastal properties at prices from Pounds
195,000 to Pounds 4m.
The cheapest was Highbury, a four-bedroom Victorian house at Northam, north
Devon, with views across Bideford Bay, for which the joint agents are Strutt
&amp; Parker at Exeter (03892-215 631) and Kevin Bright of Bideford (0237-473
241). The most expensive is the 2,090-acre Burnley Hall estate on the
Norfolk coast at Somerton, where William H. Brown is agent (0603-610 281).
Also on Bedrock's search list is Sheringham Hall, in Norfolk, a National
Trust house designed in 1812 by Humphry Repton who also laid out the
700-acre park and woods that run to the sea. As the trust's agent, the
Norwich office of Savills (0603-612 211) is seeking Pounds 1m for a 90-year
lease of this well-restored house with six acres of gardens.
The trust also wants a buyer for Signal House, a former Lloyd's signal
station on the Lizard peninsula in Cornwall which has been converted into a
four-bedroom house. Offers over Pounds 85,000 for a 99-year lease are
invited by the trust's regional land agent, Peter Mansfield (0208-74 281).
Marine Villa, built in the 18th century as a dower house on the Duke of
Hamilton's Archerfield estate at Dirleton, close to Muirfield, Scotland,
inspired Robert Louis Stevenson to write The Pavilion on the Links. Offers
over Pounds 800,000 are being sought by Hamptons in Edinburgh (031-220
6665).
Regency Cottage, on the Esplanade at Sandgate, Kent, is a six-bedroom house,
listed for its architectural and historic interest and said to have been
built in 1822 for the army officer responsible for building the south
coast's martello towers and other Napoleonic defences. It is priced at
Pounds 295,000 from the Folkestone office of Cluttons (0303-850 422).
North End House at Rottingdean, Sussex, is where the late Enid Bagnold,
author of National Velvet and other books, lived with her husband, Sir
Roderick Jones, who was chairman of Reuters, the news agency. Their
five-bedroom house opposite Rudyard Kipling's is for sale at Pounds 525,000
through Humberts at Lewes (0273-478 828). There is a staff flat, a cottage,
stables, and grounds with direct access to the south downs.
But Britain's seaside begins and ends at Brighton, where Fox &amp; Sons
(0273-688 148) has several flats for sale in converted Regency buildings on
the seafront in Marine Parade, Kemp Town, at prices from Pounds 47,000 to
Pounds 129,950. Simon Francis, manager of the Kemp Town office, says: 'The
peak time for buyers is the spring and summer - so we are expecting a
revival in the market now.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Property: What chance a pink Belgravia? - How the look of
London may change under new owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILL THE Housing and Urban Development Bill, now in the House of Lords,
change the look of London?
This is an issue that will affect millions of people who live in, work in
and visit central London. The reason the city (or at least most of it) looks
so smart is not government intervention, but the high standards of
maintenance shown over many years by some of the old, private property
estates.
If they lose ownership of their houses and flats to leaseholders who are
empowered to enfranchise under the new Bill, will that mean that the end of
the white (in fact, often magnolia) stucco of central London, repainted
every three or four years? Is it the end of smart black railings, or lawns
mown in stripes? Will Belgravia, Chelsea, South Kensington and Regent's Park
sprout magenta doors, lime green stucco and adventure playgrounds in the
gardens?
The leasehold system has been a powerful force to make London a handsome
capital city, with whole streets painted in harmony in the same colour. This
has been achieved through positive covenants in the leases which are
enforceable only because this is the context in which they appear. Through
restrictive covenants the estates also ban chickens, displays of washing,
satellite dishes and air conditioning boxes on the fronts of buildings. 'You
know when you are on an estate, and when you are off it,' says Roland Culham
of Cluttons, managing agents for Smith's Charity.
The estates' standards have been tougher and have had more success than
anything the local authorities could have done, even though they can use the
powers of the laws for Conservation Areas (which generally apply to all the
estates) and Listed Buildings. However, the way these rules are drafted,
councils are commited more to stopping buildings from falling into ruin
rather than keeping them in good repair.
Under the present rules, a few houses have enfranchised on the estates. As
part of the deal, the estate has often made management agreements with the
owners. Houseowners in Ebury Street say that these have all the same clauses
as the previous lease, except those concerning ownership. The Grosvenor
Estate reminds them when it is time to re-paint, specifies which paint to
use and inspects the job on completion. The fee for this scheme for one
house in Ebury Street has risen from Pounds 16 to Pounds 57 in five years.
These small schemes for a few houses are easy for the landlords to include
in the general costs of running their estates. But what of the future, when
there may have been piecemeal enfranchisement of well-managed estates? John
Neale, casework secretary of the Georgian Group, the conservation society,
is worried about how these properties might look. 'The effects will be
particularly bad in streets of stuccoed houses.' And Colin Redman, London
estate director for the Grosvenor Estate, foresees that 'the biggest problem
will be the lack of positive covenants to enforce.'
In an attempt to head this problem off, the new bill allows landlords to
institute management schemes for areas which they are in danger of losing.
The Leasehold Valuation Tribunal must approve these and will 'have regard to
the past development and present character of the area and to architectural
or historical considerations.'
Such schemes will be fine in the early years of enfranchisement when the
estate is largely still unified. But as the landowner loses more and more,
he will be bound to question what he is doing administering schemes for
properties which he does not own.
Expect debate on this in the Lords, and the reappearance of an amendment,
which was proposed and withdrawn in the Commons, to allow 'heritage areas'
that the Secretary for National Heritage could exempt from enfranchisement
on grounds of architectural and historical importance.
To see why it matters, walk through Belgravia and look at the details that
combine to make it a glorious showpiece of London. If it is all
enfranchised, its freeholders will have to be unusually responsible,
imaginative and co-operative. Or will a government of the future introduce a
bill to direct local authorities to restore the standards the estates now
enforce?

FT  27 FEB 93 / Sailing: Deeds of daring on the Southern Ocean
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE wind routes were the international highways of the last century,
crowded with traffic. Suddenly, they are thick with sails again, and busier
than at any time since the lost days of the clippers. The navigators are
yachtsmen, competing in an extraordinary range of circumnavigations.
Jules Verne is the inspiration for one of the most gripping events. A trophy
bearing the novelist's name is being offered by the French government for
any yacht able to sail around the world in under 80 days. Robin
Knox-Johnston and Peter Blake, winner of the last Whitbread race at the helm
of the giant ketch Steinlager, are joint skippers of the 85 ft catamaran
Enza carrying a crew of five and now 24 days into their attempt.
Earlier this week they logged one 24-hour run of 477 miles, an
extraordinarily high average speed of 19.9 knots. 'We were hitting 29-30
knots in surges, with the leeward hull frequently hidden by avalanches of
green water,' Knox-Johnston reported in a late-night satellite call from the
Southern Ocean, south of the Cape of Good Hope. 'It was the most fabulous
but hair-raising sailing any of us have done. It was also a personal record
in terms of speed for everyone on board.'
The record for non-stop circumnavigation is 109 days, set by solo French
sailor Titouan Lamazou in 1989. Lamazou is not ignoring the flurry of
attempts upon the Jules Verne trophy. Last week, his new yacht was launched
in Venice. At 143 ft, the TAGHeuer is the longest racing mono-hull ever
built. It displaces 55 tonnes and is big enough to qualify for European
Community ship-building grants. It even has a plimsoll line painted on its
hull.
Lamazou believes catamarans are not the vessels for high speeds in the
Southern Ocean. One of the other yachts competing to break the 80-day
barrier, the 89 ft trimaran Charal skippered by Olivier de Kersauson, is
limping to Cape Town after hitting a 'growler' (ice broken off a major
'berg) at high speed.
'Charal's accident confirms the met (meterological) predictions that the ice
is well north this year,' said Blake from Enza. 'We'll be keeping a
particularly close watch from now on, although your reaction time travelling
at the speeds we are is minimal in these big multi-hulls.
'Nobody has done this before, so it is important that we are reasonably
cautious. We'll push the boat along pretty fast, but I don't want to be in
conditions like the Whitbread race where there's thick fog in among the
icebergs, in a yacht averaging 20 knots in big seas.'
Convinced that life in the narrow hulls of a catamaran would be unbearable
for an extended period at high speed, Blake ordered designer Nigel Irens to
create a carbon-fibre 'command module' to be mounted between the two hulls.
Conditions proved him right.
'I'm speaking from the central pod where it is relatively dry,' said Blake.
'Outside, it's like living on a half-tide rock. There's so much water about
 -continual solid stuff everywhere, particularly at speed where it comes off
both hulls, off the central net, and even from behind. It thumps, bumps,
crashes and washes ropes all over the place but we're enjoying the sailing.'
So, too, are the 140 crew members racing towards Blake in the 10 yachts of
the British Steel Challenge. They left Hobart exactly two weeks ago and are
heading for Cape Town. The bottle screws which had faked on the previous leg
had been replaced by oversized items of twice the strength. Group 4
Securitas is leading but only 30 miles separate the front five, with Nuclear
Electric still the overall leader.
So far, they have experienced far worse weather than they did off Cape Horn,
and this could well turn out to be the toughest leg of the 27,000-mile race.
Nevertheless, when organiser Chay Blyth proposed a change to the route to
take the fleet further north into the Indian Ocean - warmer and with smaller
waves - the crews called for a referendum. Eighty-seven per cent wanted to
stick to the original route passing close to the Kerguelen Islands.
'It's nail-biting down here,' said Peter Phillips, skipper of Rhone Poulenc.
'Being three miles ahead of another yacht is considered a considerable
'cushion' at the front end of the fleet. It must be the closest
long-distance ocean racing ever. It's like being in dinghies, but here we
are at the bottom of the world.'
In spite of the huge seas, injuries have been confined to the odd broken
collarbone and rib. Times have been tougher among the fleet of largely
French yachts taking part in the Vendee Globe solo round-the-world race.
Several competitors have drowned, including British helmsman Nigel Burgess
and American sailor Mike Plant, and others pulled out through injury.
One was Bertrand de Broc, skipper of Groupe LG. He was hit in the face by
the boom after a crash gybe deep in the Southern Ocean. He bit through his
tongue, leaving the tip dangling by a thread. But de Broc was so far from
help that he had to save his own life.
From 10,000 miles away in France, doctors telexed de Broc instructions that
he must stitch the tongue himself to avoid infection and possible death from
blood poisoning. Using a mirror and local anaesthetic, de Broc managed to
insert three stitches as his yacht bucked along at over 10 knots.
The operation succeeded - but it shows that, however hi-tech the 'command
modules' and whatever the speed of the boats, in long-distance ocean racing
one rule always applies: 'no guts, no glory.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Trotting: Losing money on a Welsh Ben Hur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'NUMBER 13 has come off his legs, pull him down will you Mr Lloyd?'
THIS curious instruction can be heard echoing from a tinny loud speaker
across the purple heather-tinged hills of the Black Mountains during the
spring and summer. It tells you the trotting races are close by. Trotting is
a form of driven horse racing, in which the pony pulls 9st 7lbs of driver in
a two wheeled sulkie, it is popular with gamblers around the world: but it
could not be better set than under the black belly of rain cloud, in rolling
mid-Wales.
Certainly, if betting is a mug's game and psychiatrists are right when they
say gamblers only achieve fulfilment in chucking money away, you may as well
be ignorant of the workings of the sport when you do it. For the naive
punter, these Welsh meetings, often held on remote farmland sequestered for
an afternoon, are almost surreal in their impenetrability.
At my first meeting I placed a modest 'Pounds 1 to win' with a bookie whose
slip bore the stamp, 'M. O'Hair, Cardigan'. Would that the names of drivers
were as distinct. Heats for the Penybont W C I Eggerton Memorial Perpetual
Challenge Cup (Heat winners: Pounds 50; second: Pounds 10) included six
Davies (three from Merthyr, one each from Newcastle Emlyn, Penybont and
Plwmp) five Jones, and three Lloyds.
The meetings are run by the Wales and Border Counties Racing Association.
The association does not follow what Val Jones, its secretary, calls 'Jockey
Club rules'. The British Harness Racing Club, the umbrella body for a more
organised version of the sport, is negotiating affiliation with the Jockey
Club. It describes the mid-Wales racers as 'flappers' and wants nothing to
do with them.
At a WBCRA meeting the scene resembles a pocket production of Ben Hur. The
tubular framed chariots, seemingly held together by baling twine and silage,
churn noisily around the short circuit pressed against the wire which marks
out the short course. The drivers - men, women, boys and girls - are
penalised or 'pulled down', for allowing their ponies to break out of a
trot, which is when they 'come off their legs'.
Betting is a haphazard business given the scope for baulking, accidental or
otherwise, on the crowded course. Often the on-course bookies will refuse to
give odds on a competitor which is considered a certainty - if it finishes
first they pay winning bets on the second placed horse. However, I have
never seen such a pony win. To add to the difficulty, the drivers need not
be tugged around the mile in a sulkie. A lone trotting pony may be saddled
in the conventional way, giving the impression that its rider has somehow
gatecrashed the event and, unencumbered, has an advantage. Bitter experience
has proved otherwise.
Staggered starts are used in all the races and the programme shows the
majority of competitors to be classified as 'Go' and the remainder owed one,
two, three or four seconds depending on their records. To the untutored
observer the ponies appear to start and finish in a clump - but not to Colin
Davies, commentator and all-round controller, who oversees proceedings from
the superior vantage point of a flatbed trailer parked among the rusting
Suburu and Lada 4WDs of the spectators. (There are few shiny Landcruisers or
Discoveries here and you will find scarcely a Barbour in the sea of sensible
tweed beside the track.)
Davies provides coded illumination to the punters ('Oh and he is going a
good little pony]') and, with the help of an invisible factotum known as
Yanto, the on-course supervision. One wonders how Brough Scott would cope
with the combined responsibility of judging and commentating on the race,
describing the whereabouts of the ambiwlans, organising the drivers as well
as coordinating the best turned out pony prize.
Apart from the gratification of throwing your money at the bookies and
gorging on Welsh lamb burgers, what is the appeal of trotting?
'You get addicted to it,' says Jones. 'There's the thrill of the running and
it is so pretty to watch. We find that people will follow one horse from
meeting to meeting. Aside from the betting, it is also a lovely family day
out.'
The mid-Wales trotting season runs from March to late September. A programme
of meetings is available from Val Jones, 1, Saint Cynidr Villas, Glasbury on
Wye, Hereford, HR3 5NN. Tel: 0497-847-603.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Motoring: Help for the careful driver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF motoring's minor scandals is the way some drivers use a breakdown
scheme as a substitute for servicing their cars or even keeping them in safe
running order. According to Tony Dunlop, managing director of one of the
leading operators, Europ Assistance, genuine roadside breakdowns are quite
rare.
He says many demands for help are from the kind of people who call out
motoring organisations two or three times each year because of flat
batteries, flat tyres or empty tanks. This puts up membership costs for
responsible subscribers who check their tyres now and again and do not
ignore a low fuel warning light. 'Many considerate drivers feel they are
subsidising other motorists' negligence and not getting value for money,'
Dunlop adds.
Coincidentally, the AA has just put out breakdown recovery statistics
confirming the point made by its Europ Assistance rival. Almost 9 per cent
of AA breakdown call-outs are due to faulty batteries. This does not include
batteries that went flat because lights had been left on and could be
recharged; they account for another 6 per cent. At fault are batteries so
far gone that the only answer is a new one.
Every AA and RAC patrolman has stories of members calling them out to start
cars with flat batteries and then, as an encore, expecting the equivalent of
a free 15,000-mile service. And, for some time, the motoring organisations
have black-listed members who make totally unreasonable demands on their
services.
This week, Europ Assistance has bitten the bullet and introduced Select, a
breakdown service for responsible motorists who do not run neglected cars
with dud batteries, almost-empty tanks, and tyres that have lost most of the
tread.
Europ Assistance says Select is only one-third of the price of the average
motoring organisation's breakdown service. For Pounds 35 a year (or Pounds
65 for two years, Pounds 95 for three) it provides round-the-clock
comprehensive breakdown cover including hotel expenses, car hire and so on.
One or two extra cars can be covered for only Pounds 35 a car for three
years.
If Select subscribers do run out of fuel or lock themselves out of their
cars, all is not lost. Europ Assistance still rides to the rescue but
charges the motorist 'at cost' according to nationally-agreed rates.
Another breakdown scheme for the thinking car-owner is offered by the Guild
of Experienced Motorists. For Pounds 17.95 a year (plus Pounds 12 annual
membership), GEM covers the full cost of breakdown recovery or roadside
repair, including up to Pounds 35 spent on getting a car going at a member's
home.
Members pay the bill and then claim on GEM, which works through 1,500
approved garages linked to a 24-hour help-line. but do not call if your
driving licence has been endorsed for a serious motoring offence. GEM is
heavily into road safety and wants only caring, conscientious motorists as
members.
An independent survey revealed this week that the law requiring tyres to
have 1.6mm pattern depth continuously round 75 per cent of the tread width
is being treated with contempt. Up to two-thirds of tyres removed for
replacement are worn beyond this limit. Fifteen per cent are damaged so
badly that they are blow-outs waiting to happen.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Motoring: Get a grip on wheelspin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INCH of snow, or a muddy car park, can bring any car to a wheel-spinning
standstill. A four-wheel drive is the conventional, expensive answer.
A low-cost alternative is a pair of plastic Autotrax ramps, heavily toothed
on both sides to grip both ground and tyre. Slip their thin ends under the
drive wheels, accelerate gently and they will give enough traction to get a
car going. Do not forget to go back for them - they cost about Pounds 30 a
pair and will be in the shops soon. Call 0285-885-201 for details.
Nothing is more difficult to fit into a car than a bicycle. For those
daunted by the thought of lifting cycles on to roof-racks, Paddy Hopkirk has
a universal rear cycle carrier holding up to three bikes.
It can be fitted without tools (and without marking the paint) to almost any
car, but must be used with a number plate or trailer board if the driver is
to stay within the law. About Pounds 50 from motoring shops or call
0525-850-800.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel: Waylaid by Dante's little paradise - Nigel Andrews
is captivated by Italy's Ligurian Riviera and a pizza at Luigi's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIGEL ANDREWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ligurian Riviera is a chain of ambush posts set up by nature in concert
with the Italian tourist board. Beautiful Viareggio, elegant Santa
Margherita, enchanting Portofino: as dusk falls on your drive along the
tunnel-strewn autostrada, it is hard to resist being waylaid. Beguiled by
the advertisement for a four-star hotel sulla mare, you will find yourself
happy and financially impoverished in the morning.
My own favourite watering-place is Sestri Levante. Some guidebooks refer to
it, rudely, as the most 'commercial' of the Riviera resorts, but it is
hardly Blackpool. This exquisite peninsular town, between Lavagna and
Levanto, pushes out into the sea and then rises into a park-size bluff at
its end. On this verdant promontory, I spent two nights in a suite at the
Hotel Dei Castelli with a balcony-cum-roof from which you can gaze down at
both Sestri's beautiful shorelines.
If I say that this little paradise once was praised by Dante and Petrarch,
you will remark, rightly, that so was every other town in Italy if travel
literature is believed. But, in Sestri at least, you see what might have
provoked their transports.
The town grows along a narrow isthmus. On one side is the long, commercial
beach ending in a huddle of multi-coloured fishing vessels perched under the
cliff. On the other side is a perfect crescent of shoreline created by the
mainland to the north-east and the promontory to the south-west.
Here, the light is silver, the cliffs a deep, breathing green, and the
houses are painted in bright pastel washes. The silence is palpable even
when there is noise about: I have never been in a place so mystifyingly
serene. If you can bear smallish rooms, the Helvetia hotel, a pretty, white
wedding cake overlooking the water, has a superb command of the bay.
You can stroll from one end of town to the other in 30 minutes. Cars are as
redundant here as in Venice, although, for canals, read narrow pedestrian
shopping streets: up-market streets, too, as you run the gauntlet of Guccis
and Versaces.
Always try to look upwards. This way, you will avoid the lure of the costly
shop windows and also notice a Sestri Levante speciality. The houses are
painted with patterns: neo-Pompeian swags and flourishes, trompe l'oeil
imitations of relief work, and decorative 'tiling' that is not tiling at all
but an artist's mock-up.
Viewed from afar, it all looks like Toytown. It can also behave like that.
As in Venice, real life keeps sliding aside to be replaced by stage-set
views and seemingly staged incidents.
Surely the 12 Italian women who passed by me on a pavement, singing in
perfect harmony some melodic Ligurian folk song, were laid on as a stunt?
Surely I did not really see a gaily-coloured plaster dwarf built into the
side of an old tree? (I did - my photo album proves it). And what about that
seagull that sat in the sand and did not budge even when I approached to
stroke it. I was struck by its poetic, ruminative look: perhaps it was the
transmogrified spirit of Dante or Petrarch.
The Hotel Dei Castelli - you drive to it up hair-pinning cobbled streets or,
if on foot, ascend from the beach by a lift - consists of two crenellated
villas set in a large garden. They were built from the rocks of the fallen
Genoese castle that once stood here.
Since the rooms are furnished monastically, you should take a suite and send
your bank manager a pacifying postcard. My suite provided inspiring views,
and more can be obtained by walking around the garden and then around the
whole promontory. Only rickety fences prevent you from plunging down
thyme-scattered cliffs into a cobalt sea. But enjoy the light, which is
Capri-like, and also note the Marconi tower, a small, rude ruin whence the
wireless inventor sent some early messages to listening battleships off La
Spezia.
It is evening, and I repair to Luigi's for a pizza. This is where Sestri
Levante ascends from the magical to the completely uplifting. Luigi's is
along the street from the town's other main hotel, the Balbi, with its
garden guarded by stone lions and its interior that of a scarce-changed 18th
century villa. Have a coffee here after Luigi's, or a drink before, and
stroll between venues along a street balmy with night scents. At Luigi's
itself, insist on a pizza diavola burnt to a near crisp, and irrigate it
with some cold house wine.
If you feel the need to get out and about while based at Sestri, visit the
Cinque Terre. These are five remote fishing villages lying to the town's
east. Once, they were so inaccessible that their inhabitants never saw a
tourist and scarcely saw an Italian from another part of the country.
Alternatively, drive to Varese Ligure, where a 15th century castle awaits
you and where the local nuns make an income from tempting you with scivette
(marzipan flowers).
Back in Sestri itself, the only thing you cannot do with ease - be warned -
is sea-bathe. There is water everywhere but it is usurped by boats. If you
stay at the Hotel Dei Castelli, you can use its bathing facility: a rocky
inlet between cliffs. Very picturesque. But time your dip for the brief
space of time in which the sun peers, sometimes furiously, into the chasm.
Otherwise, pencil-in bathing for the second leg of your Italian holiday.
Sestri Levante is for land-lubbers only: those who like to look at the sea
without getting involved too closely.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel: Driven to distraction - Snapshot / Rio de Janeiro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MUCH in Rio de Janeiro is hard to believe, especially to the first-time
visitor. A fairytale destination? Not exactly. Who could believe it possible
to find a cab driver in Rio unable to find Corcovada? The massive statue of
Christ the Redeemer is perched 2,500ft above the city, visible from every
street and square. Better-known, even, than Sugar Loaf mountain.
Squeezed in the back of a sweaty VW Beetle we fumed and eventually had to
laugh as our driver, new to Rio, asked directions of incredulous
street-smart children at every junction. Of course, the meter was running
and we were paying.
However, any connection between the meter and what one pays for a cab in Rio
is about as notional as the exchange rate for the Brazilian cruzeira. Any
taxi journey has to start with a session worthy of the EC finance ministers.
One can sympathise. In a country with annualised inflation running at close
to 1,000 per cent, a rate-per-mile agreed at breakfast-time is likely to
look meagre by sunset.
For the first-time tourist in Rio - a dwindling species - things can be
bewildering. Items are either very cheap or hugely expensive - and quite
randomly. Clean, well-appointed hotel rooms overlooking Copacabana Beach for
around USDollars 40 a night? No problem.
Admittedly, the hotels are 20- to 25-years-old and in need of refurbishment.
But there has been virtually no new building on the famous beach since US
tourists - fragile creatures - decided Rio was the wrong side of the tracks.
Yet the views and the local colour make the the beach-front hotels a
bargain.
Just avoid the telephone. Most visitors learn only as they are checking out
of their hotels that Brazil is attempting to pay off its national debt via
the tariff for international calls. An item of USDollars 76 for an
eight-minute call to
Britain certainly lodged in the throat.
Grazing in street cafes is the most economical and enjoyable way to eat
during the day. A thimbleful of strong black coffee and a voluptuous pastry
layered with cheese and ham will cost the local equivalent of 75p.
While the area two or three blocks back from Copacabana is lively and
fascinating, it is also dangerous. Most Brazilian muggers seem keener on
goods than violence but they are also thick on the ground. Hardly a day goes
by without another unfortunate trailing into the hotel lobby minus handbag
or wallet.
One experienced Rio hand told me never to voyage abroad with more than a
single credit card, handful of cruzeiras for walking-about money and Dollars
20 for emergencies. It came to seem like good advice.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel Focus (France): To the manoir drawn: the lure of old
Brittany - Chris Eales discovers some gentle spring retreats at a reasonable
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS EALES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN MY friends are tired of London, they call me. I live in a manoir,
something less than 20 kilometres from the northern coast of Celtic
Brittany. British Celts founded this presqu'ile in the fifth century AD.
Perhaps this is why mainland Britons have a peculiar affinity with the
Bretons. At any rate, the Brits camp in droves each summer and the Brets
reckon they get on better with them than with the mecs from Paris.
Malheureusement, I tell my friends, there are not enough rooms in this
modest, 14th century manoir. It is tucked away in the heart of the Tregor, a
tranquil pocket of 900 acres in the Cote d'Armor and bounded by some of
Europe's most splendid coastline, right opposite Devon. So, I decided to
visit some of the Tregor's many larger manoirs that actually rent out their
ancient rooms. All are eminently satisfactory for those who would like a
gentle spring retreat at a reasonable price in a place where the land
wrestles with the sea.
My journey followed the footsteps and magnifying glasses of many posh
architectural antiquarians. Professors have crawled all over manoirs here,
some counting the rings of their wooden beams to date them. Nobles built and
lived in them more than 600 years ago when Brittany was independent of
France. Many manoirs were left to tumble by farmers who acquired them after
the Revolution, but plenty have been saved and renovated to a high standard.
Their chunky stone walls and towers, used originally for defence, remain a
dominant feature.
Bretons say it rains every day and twice on Sundays, but it forgot to rain
the day I made my tour; indeed, the sky was bright blue. I got in the car
and weaved off along the Tregor's roads, hardly big enough for more than one
vehicle. I was heading toward the Chateau de Brelidy, a 16th century manoir
with 10 guest rooms. I was soon lost in the wild, raw countryside of browns,
greens, high banks, and the occasional grey of an old stone house puffing
smoke. Somewhere, a dog barked. Otherwise, it was quiet. I was not in a
hurry. Nobody ever is in Brittany.
At the Chateau de Brelidy, I met Hector, a suit of shining armour. I did not
know he was a fake until Madame Yoncourt, who owns the manoir, told me. Also
on display are stuffed snipe and, oddly, a collection of wedding dresses.
Apparently, honeymooners used to stay there. In the hallway, through a glass
cabinet, I saw the imprints of a hand on a fourth century drain, dug up in
the chateau grounds under the ruins of an 11th century hill fort. Away in
the distance were fuzzy tree outlines and the lonely Menez-Bre, at 300
metres the highest point in the area.
Like a dot, the summit is crowned by the tiny chapel of St Herve, a blind
saint who climbed barefoot to it centuries ago. Legend says he was asked to
advise bishops meeting at the chapel. When he arrived, a bishop thought he
was a tramp and mocked him. The bishop suddenly went blind. St Herve found
water, even on the hill, and splashed it on the bishop's eyes. He saw again.
You could spend the whole time within the chateau's splendidly restored
walls of stone. Madame Yoncourt cooks dinner, a daily choice of Breton
dishes. Specialities are homard a l'armoricaine (lobster), palourdes
(cockles) and belons (flat-shelled oysters). There is a library and
television lounge, even a full-size billiard table. I drank a demi slowly
before I left.
The Chateau de Kermezen, a smaller manoir, is about 10 km north of Brelidy,
close to the village of Pommerit Jaudy. Here, guests eat and drink with the
count and countess of Kermel. No need to tremble. The countess treats her
guests as her family and she cooks different local dishes each day.
Two stone towers mark its courtyard. One of them once was a pigeonnier in
which Breton nobles kept pigeons, which they ate; the number depended on the
amount of land the manoir held. Hence, the size of the pigeonnier tells how
important the manoir is. This one is impressive and so are its owners.
The count, who greeted me first, was wearing Wellington boots and carrying a
chainsaw. The countess was at the back, digging the garden where the land
declines steeply to the river Jaudy and a gorgeous valley. She told me
later, as we sat by the fire sipping whisky: 'The chateau has been in the
family since the 1400s. The villagers returned it to us after the
Revolution.'
The sea is never more than a 20-minute drive from anywhere in the Tregor but
from Plougrescant, at the Manoir de Kergrec'h, owned by the viscount and
viscountess Stephanie de Roquefeuil, it is merely a delightful stroll away.
In fact, this ivy-clad 17-century manoir (there are four guest rooms) is on
the Circuit de La Cote des Ajoncs, an inspiring coastal walk lined by ajonc,
a distinctive gorse.
A dramatic feature of this coast, called the Cote de Granit Rose after its
pink-coloured rocks, is to be found at Tregastel where huge slabs of smooth
granite tower over the beach. They have been eroded into intriguing shapes -
here a tortoise, there a whale. Their completely irregular angles seem
man-chiselled, but this is a perfectly natural phenomenon and free to
visitors.
If magnificent sea and country walks, punctuated by a glass of Muscadet and
a dozen oysters, are too relaxing, there is always hunting and fishing. All
arrangements will be made at any of the manoirs. And, if risking your cash
is favoured, there is a roulette table in the casino at Perros Guirec, the
chic-est spot on the coast.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel Focus (France): Taking the waters in Aix-le-Bains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN BOULE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLAYER ran a few paces along the gravel and flicked his boule through
the air in a fierce arc. The steel ball glinted in mid-flight before
plummeting on to a nest of boules, one of which cannoned into the board at
the edge of the playing area. The player smiled and applause broke out among
the several thousand spectators.
Under the floodlights, half a dozen matches were taking place. The
competitors, many dressed in matching shell-suits, either catapulted their
deliveries or knelt to roll the boule with a care bordering on tenderness.
They seemed oblivious to the rain cascading into the marquee, or the gale
buffeting the flaps.
Taking refuge from the downpour, we had gate-crashed the national French
four-a-side boules championships in Aix-les-Bains, taking place by the side
of the beautiful Lac du Bourget. The surrounding village of tents, selling
the local Savoy wines, food, or beer and pastis to quench the thirst of the
fans, was a quagmire. Overnight, the temperature had dropped from 31``C to
13`C.
The day before, we had taken a pleasure boat across Lac du Bourget -
France's largest lake - to the Abbaye Royale at Hautecombe, which has a
magnificent position on a small headland jutting into the water. The abbey,
part of which dates from the 12th century, is the burial place of the counts
of the duchy of Savoy. The duchy was part of the kingdom of Sardinia for a
time but was incorporated into France in 1860.
We sailed from the Grand Port at Aix-les-Bains, where an elegant arch of
plane trees on the waterfront esplanade gave shelter from the sun. Swans,
coots and mallards fought over the crusty pickings of baguettes thrown from
the shore by picnickers. We disembarked by a stone boathouse, centuries old.
Until recently, the abbey - restored in the 19th century - was run by the
Benedictines; now, a Christian charismatic community has taken it over. In
its cool and quiet, we were given hand-held radio sets which, like an unseen
guide, directed us past murals and white statues.
There is a cafe in the garden next to the abbey, overlooking the lake
towards Aix-les-Bains. A woman from the community brought our drinks and
stayed talking for a while. 'The climate is changing,' she told us. 'Certain
kinds of flowers have stopped growing.' We were relieved to hear that she
also was waiting for what she called the 'fraicheur' (coolness) to arrive.
And, the following day, arrive it did.
Deluges apart, Lac du Bourget and the surrounding flat-topped mountains have
much to offer. There are plenty of water sports and rock-climbing: on a walk
through the forest past the foot of the sheer cliffs we passed groups of
climbers, including a family where the father was coaxing his young son up
the rock face. And there is hang-gliding. We saw gliders almost motionless,
thousands of feet up in the hot sky, buoyed by the lake thermals.
Although there is little snow in winter - there is a micro-climate by the
lake which makes bananas grow - resorts such as Grenoble and Albertville are
not far. We found good walks, often with exhilarating views, around the lake
although some required us to tramp along roads. The paths weaved through
thick woods of pine, oak and beech, meadows, and villages with
small-holdings growing grapes, pumpkins, corn, aubergines, walnuts and
fruit. Not so exhilarating were the loud and unfriendly German Shepherds
that guarded almost every house and farm.
The dry grass of the meadows was dotted with delicate alpine flowers. It
also seethed and rustled with cicadas, small lizards and much else besides,
including a snake with bilious green spots.
A swim in the lake was a good way to cool off at the end of a hot day's
hiking. There is an entry fee for the beach in Aix-les-Bains, at the Petit
Port. But at Chatillon, at the quiet northern end of the lake close to the
picturesque Savieres canal that links up with the river Rhone, the beach was
free and the water warm, if rather slimy underfoot.
The chief claim to fame of Aix-les-Bains is its thermal baths, fed by hot
springs. The earliest baths date from Roman times but the modern ones are
situated at the top of the town in a vast building, drearily imposing and
reminiscent of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
In the footsteps of Bonaparte and Queen Victoria, not to mention Verlaine
and the 50,000 French who take the waters annually on their national health
service, I decided to try the thermal plunge. My wife abstained. The smell
of sulphur grew stronger and stronger in the wide, marbled corridors and
stairways where the curistes - the receptionist referred tartly to me, a
once-off user, as a touriste - rested on sun-loungers. Afterwards, I felt
both refreshed and enervated. The whiff of sulphur remained on my skin for
the rest of the day.
Before leaving, we heard that the Aix-les-Bains team had won the boules
championship. Perhaps the water had something to do with it.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel Focus (France): Wilderness where horses know best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHENEVER the horses reached high ground, Henri would sing, quietly and
exultantly. Years in the French colonial service had earned him early
retirement from the drudgery of a Toulouse bank. His great passion was to
explore his beloved Languedoc on Brigand, his Roman-nosed bay. And so, at
evening, while the rest of us were untacking and grooming, Henri and Brigand
would canter off for a solitary hour as the sun set behind the foothills of
the Pyrenees.
Henri was not the only one reluctant to turn in after a day on horseback.
The Corbieres, a remote inland corner of south-west France, is a varied and
beautiful region of barren hills, limestone peaks, forests and gorges. Eight
years ago, the owners of 12 gites, or farmhouses, banded together as Les
Sentiers du Sud. They offer accommodation and mounts for visitors attracted
by the local network of sentiers: 800 kilometres of well-maintained paths.
Inntravel, of York, a specialist in independent travel, uses Sentiers du Sud
to offer week-long riding holidays. A guide takes groups of six to nine from
one isolated farmhouse to another, rarely setting hoof on a road.
Self-piloting circuits can be made by really experienced riders, and there
is a gentle, confidence-building option for novices.
The stone farmhouses all belong to working farms, some of them as old as the
14th century. Before the depopulation wreaked by this century's wars, some
40 individuals would have lived in crowded squalor at La Bastide, an upland
farm beneath the frowning peak of Bugarach. These days, the massive walls
shelter just two families: a Catalan activist and the gite's owner, a sheep
breeder-cum-jazz musician.
Our guide, Jean-Claude Pons, succeeded in being calmly authoritative without
being bossy. He is typical of the Sentiers du Sud crowd in being a refugee
from city life. Recent decades have seen an influx of settlers in search of
rural simplicity. Tourism apart, the newcomers produce herbs, organic
grapes, honey and wild-boar pate. They weave, dye silk scarves, and breed
the black Merens mountain horses. But life gets no easier in this wild,
barren region and locals complain bitterly of neglect by the bureaucrats in
Paris.
Social life lacks sparkle so the gite owners seem genuinely happy to dine
with their guests in the evening. Rooms in converted out-buildings are
simple and comfortable. Each morning, the saddle-bags are filled with pies
of vegetable and wild boar, cheeses, and flasks of red wine. The food is
welcome on a ride which can last six hours, across gruellingly steep
terrain. The horses are part-Arab, agile and brave, with good mouths, iron
legs and no aversion to a gallop. A rider needs to be competent and prepared
to accept that, whatever goes on in the covered school in Wimbledon, on the
Sentiers du Sud the horse knows best.
On our visit, the days were so lovely, they almost hurt. There were no car
fumes, no articulated lorries, hardly a gate. How would it be possible to
endure Oxfordshire mud, hostile farmers and murderous drivers again? Here,
at least, riders were not the enemy. That role was played by Spaniards
roaring up the tracks in their off-road vehicles to steal the pink mushrooms
called laiteuses de delice.
As late as the 18th century, the fortresses of southern Corbieres guarded
what was still the Spanish-French border. Approached slowly on horseback,
the magnificent castles at Arques, Puilaurens and Peyrepertuse are more
evocative than ever.
In the castle at Arques, a newsletter for latter-day Cathars offered proof
of the romantic, quasi-historical baloney which is such an abundant crop in
the Pays de Cathares. The myth is that every castle was a nest of
millennarian, vegetarian, free-loving Cathar heretics.
In reality, the castles say more about the rivalries of seigneurs rich from
dues on wine and wool, and from excursions against the Moors across the
mountains. Today, the rise of sentimental Catharism is just one more
expression of enduring southern hostility towards the north. Impoverished,
yet fiercely proud of its past, the Corbieres is a place of rare beauty.
Explored on horseback, its solitude seems to enter your soul.
Inntravel is at The Old Station Helmsley, York YO6 5BZ, tel. 0439-71111.
1993 prices for accompanied rides are Pounds 660 (including flight to
Toulouse), or Pounds 560 self-drive.

Tyler introduces a special feature on the delights of cross-Channel holidays

YOU HAVE it or you don't. That is what they always tell you. The trouble
with this brutal classification is that those of us who don't have it - the
majority, I suppose - never think to question a verdict apparently handed
down by our genetic code.
So, it was only through the accident of being married to someone who does
have it that I found myself last year poised foolishly in front of an easel,
palette in one hand, a clutch of brushes in the other, in a remote mountain
valley in the south of France.
The scene is engraved in the memory. Above me, the branches of a thorn tree
provided some shade. On one side, the stream clattered down its rocky bed to
form a pool among boulders streaked with rusty whorls but as smooth and
rounded as the back of a bathing elephant. On the other side, grasshoppers
skipped about in a field of bracken and violet butterflies zig-zagged over
the water. Each evening, the goat lady came, walking her chestnut-coloured
flock over the stepping stones to the sound of a clonking bell.
For two days, I stared at that rock pool until I knew every line and
contour, every fold and pocket. A painting is never finished, a famous
artist is said to have remarked, only abandoned. The thing on my easel
looked dreadful and was getting worse. So, I abandoned it.
If you have not picked up a paint brush since the age of 10, you will feel
as helpless as a child, stubborn and petulant when things go wrong and
pathetically dependent on praise and encouragement. You have to learn to
forget yourself, forget what you know about the world, and look. For the
world is a different, more concentrated place when you are trying to paint
it. It is no longer a collection of familiar objects understood by you but a
pattern of shapes and shades which have no purpose other than to defy your
efforts to describe them. Learning to paint is the kind of challenge best
attempted, it seems to me, in some remote place where there are real
painters around to help and sympathise but no other holiday-makers to peer
over your shoulder in silent mockery.
On the first day, I was given a large sheet of paper, a stick of charcoal
and two erasers. I had to cover the paper in black, then use the erasers to
bring the object (in this case, a cane chair) out of the blackness. It was a
back-to-front, inside-out way of drawing, and I cannot draw. But it worked.
A day or so later, I was sitting in an apple orchard with a box of gouache
(more opaque than watercolours and, thus, easier to manage). That sort of
worked, too.
So, I demanded to be allowed out with real oil paints - more intimidating
but also more liberating - and, after two failed attempts at landscape,
produced an unfinished painting, life-size, of a pair of derelict boots
(move over, van Gogh) of which I am still desperately proud.
Every year, the number of advertised painting holidays in France or Italy
seems to double. Some are organised very well, but most charge more than a
novice might be willing to risk for a fortnight in a rural retreat. Our
choice was basic, informal and - apart from the cost of getting there -
cheap.
The house, in the hamlet of Randavel, is a former silk-worm farm, the size
and thickness of a small fortress and typical of that part of France, which
the two owners - one of them a painter who teaches at a London art school -
are restoring by slow degrees. Living space is at ground level and studios
have been created above in the huge, double-storey chambers in which the
silk-worms once were reared. We were fed excellently by the owner herself
and sat up every night with her, her visiting art students and her
Irish-Breton teacher friend from the village, drinking large quantities of
local red wine for the equivalent of 42p a bottle.
Her house dominates the hamlet, one of several in the upper reaches of the
Herault valley, underneath Mont Aigoual in the Cevennes national park. A few
modern villas have grown up along the fast new road, built with European
Community subsidy, that runs from the valley mouth at Ganges to the mountain
pass at L'Esperou, a small ski resort. But the upper Herault remains a wild
area of mediaeval peasant buildings and fierce Protestant sects which has
yet to make the transition from silk-farming (destroyed by Japanese
competition) to tourism.
At either end of summer, the weather is wild. The winds collect around the
summit of Mont Aigoual and whip down the valley in storms of impressive
ferocity. In mid-summer, the elevation provides relief from the burning
temperatures of the plain below, and the water in the rock pools is sharp
enough to take your breath away. The valley sides are steep and stony and
covered in oak and chestnut: there are paths to challenge the keenest
ramblers, and eagles and moufflons to watch.
A few kilometres downstream is the village of Vallerauge with its oddly
imposing architecture, two cafes, two restaurants and the usual combination
of shops. The towns of Ganges and its more bourgeois sister, Le Vigan, have
entertaining weekly markets.
The Randavel Experience is far from de luxe but it is comfortable enough -
especially now that main drainage has arrived - and authentic to the last
clove of garlic. You might even find you have a pair of genes that paint.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Disaster threatens a natural wonder: Olga Speranskaya on the
pollution of Lake Baikal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OLGA SPERANSKAYA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA HAS paid a terrible price for the Soviet tradition of 'storming
nature' - the idea that air, water and abundant natural resources were there
for man to assault violently without thought for the human and economic
cost, or the ecological consequences. Starting with Stalin's decision to
build the White Sea canal with slave labour in the 1920s, the communists
showed an irresistible urge to throw millions of people and vast resources
at projects that were nothing but propaganda.
These were designed to impress the Soviet people and the world with the
regime's implacable will and its ability to accomplish monumental schemes
and gravity-defying feats. For decades, huge dams were built which flooded
rich agricultural land to produce electricity for non-existent factories or
to irrigate, for example, the mono-culture of cotton in the central Asian
republics, desiccating the Aral sea in the process.
Partly to repair this damage, the planners then proposed to create another
ecological disaster by diverting the mighty Siberian rivers from their
natural courses. Nature has them flowing northwards into the Arctic ocean,
draining the Siberian swamps. Instead, they were to be channeled south for
thousands of kilometres, raising water levels and leaching salt and minerals
from soils as they went. Again, the aim was to irrigate central Asia.
Cost-benefit analyses along capitalist lines were unknown in such projects.
Only as the power of the Communist party dwindled in the 1980s did it become
possible to question seriously either the economic rationale, or the
ecological consequences, of projects which had drained resources for decades
and contributed to the grotesque deformations of the economic system.
The collapse of the Soviet Union, and the economy, put paid to the Siberian
rivers scheme. But it came too late to prevent the outlay of billions of
roubles on one of the world's most improbable railways: the
Baikal-Amur-Mainline (BAM).
This runs for more than 2,000 km (1,250 miles) through what was once a world
of virgin forest, crystal rivers and forbidding mountains. The politburo
decided to build the railway deep inside the permafrost zone where metals
snap like twigs, buildings sink, and motors have to be kept running 24 hours
a day or they freeze up within minutes.
Like so many Soviet schemes, the idea of driving a railway through some of
the world's harshest and least inhabited terrain was dreamed up by Stalin,
only to be abandoned hastily when the second world war began. It was
resurrected by Stalin's spiritual heir, Leonid Brezhnev, in the 1970s when
the idea of building a line through Siberia north of Lake Baikal reflected
military concern at the vulnerability of the existing trans-Siberian railway
at a time of tension with China.
The launch of the so-called 'project of the century' was also accompanied by
much loose talk of 'unlocking the Siberian treasure chest' and opening up a
vast area of Siberia to human habitation. Above all, its proponents argued,
the railway would help to exploit the mineral wealth locked up in the
mountain ranges through which the heroic tunnel drillers, bridge-builders
and track-layers made their difficult and expensive way.
Twenty years later, the railway is still not operating fully and only one of
the projected pits, the Japanese-financed and equipped Neryungri hard coal
mine, has been built. Some 13m tons a year now flows down a
specially-constructed spur of the BAM to be hauled over mountains and steep
gradients nearly 1,000 km (625 miles) from Neryungri to the Pacific coast,
from where it is exported to Japan. It must be the most expensive coal in
the world.
Building the railway - with its nine tunnels, 139 large bridges and
viaducts, and 3,760 smaller bridges and culverts over and under fast-flowing
rivers and steep ravines - also opened up a vast area for logging and other
operations. But logging dislodged thin soils and polluted the rivers,
including those which flow into Baikal. The lake is one of the world's
wonders and the fight to prevent it being spoiled is among the main concerns
of the ecological movement in Russia.
Baikal is unique in several respects. It is the most ancient lake on earth.
Whereas the average lake lives 'only' 10,000 years, Baikal is 25m years old.
Even the stars looked different when its waters began to fill a giant rift
in the earth's surface which is still the heart of tectonic activity in the
region. Because of shifts in the planet's crust, the lake gains two
centimetres in width every year. Now, it extends 636 km (400 miles) from
south to north, and is up to 80 km (50 miles) wide.
With a maximum depth of 1,742 metres (5,714 ft), Baikal is, above all, the
deepest lake in the world. In surface area it is smaller than the US Great
Lakes but, because of its depth, it has 20 per cent of the earth's surface
fresh water.
As a closed ecological system, Baikal is famous for its wealth of plants and
animals. So far, about 2,600 different species have been identified, of
which 85 per cent are endemic to the lake. But Baikal today is not only a
collection of natural superlatives - it is a tight tangle of problems and
emotions.
The trans-Siberian railway, built at the beginning of the century, runs
along its southern shore past Irkutsk, one of many heavily-polluted
industrial cities in ecologically-vulnerable Siberia. The construction of
the BAM, and the new town of Severobaikalsk more than 600 km to the north,
threatened to repeat the degenerative processes in the lake's northern area.
Baikal's purity was first infringed on a significant scale by Moscow's
decision to build the Baikalsk cellulose paper combine near the southern end
in 1966. Its construction became a catalyst for the fledgling Green movement
in Russia, and the debate over the plant developed into the the first legal
battle between the communist system and ordinary people.
Among the first to protest was academician Grigori Galazy, now the director
of the Lake Baikal museum. But he remains pessimistic about the possibility
of effective protective measures. 'None of the many decrees and orders to
protect the lake were fully implemented,' he says. 'Every day, the combine
discharges up to 250,000 litres of supposedly clean waters into the lake.
But these waters, even after the treatment they receive, need to be diluted
at least 10,000 times to be considered clean.'
Mikhail Grachev, director of the Limnological Institute in Irkutsk, adds:
'The main value of Lake Baikal is its fresh, clean water and its value will
only grow with time. We must elaborate a concept towards Lake Baikal and
strictly follow it. The lake can be used as a fishery resource and treasured
as beautiful place for tourism and rest. But, above all, it should be seen
and treasured as the planet's well, with crystal-clean waters. We have no
right to take any risk and we must preserve it.'
Baikal has proved to have a unique and highly-effective ability to clean
itself, something that makes it different from other sources of fresh waters
on earth. If its eco-system is not overloaded, this process will continue.
But building new towns with inadequate sewerage and drainage, and the effect
of de-forestation along the banks of the rivers feeding into it, have
increased pressure on its self-purification capacity.
One indicator of the pollution is that Baikal's best-known fish, the omul,
now begins to spawn at around seven or eight years when it weighs around
180-200 grammes. Before the combine was built, the fish began to spawn at
three to four years at a weight of 500 grammes.
The Baikalsk combine is not the only source of pollution, though. The Selnge
river, the main tributary of Baikal, rises in Mongolia and gathers wastes
along its way to the lake. Last year alone, industry in the Ulan-Ude region
to the east of the lake dumped 39,000 tons of pollutants into the river.
Sewage treatment in settlements in this area is either too little or
non-existent. Only 31 new water-treatment units, out of of 83 planned, have
been built and shortage of money means many lack crucial engineering work.
Meanwhile, heavy industry along the Angara river, which flows out of the
lake, and scores of antiquated thermal power stations burning bad-quality
coal add their sulphur and nitrogen oxides to the air pollution.
To supply industry with electricity, the Soviet authorities also built power
stations on the Angara. This had unpredicted ecological side-effects on the
lake. Dr Olga Kozhova, director of the biology institute at Irkutsk
university, explains. 'For millions of years, dozens of species lived in
shallow waters and evolved in accord with natural changes in the lake's
water level.
'Construction of the Irkutsk hydro-electric power station on the Angara
river in 1958 changed the situation dramatically. It raised the water level
by a metre and water levels are now regulated artificially, depending on the
needs of industry. As a result, inshore fishes such as the yellow-fin Baikal
sculpin - a kind of miller's thumb fish - have lost their spawning grounds.
Their numbers have dropped sharply.'
Faced with growing popular protests, the Soviet government decided in 1987
to convert the Baikalsk combine into a furniture factory by 1993. That will
help. But Grachev believes the best way to exploit Baikal in an ecologically
acceptable way is to extract, bottle and sell its contents as premium
mineral water. The Limnological institute is trying to raise money to build
a plant to produce 20m bottles a year, plus ice cubes. 'It would would cost
Dollars 5-10m,' he says. 'The main problem is plastic bottle production - to
ensure they are chemically neutral and safe.'
Grachev's plan is one thing. But the real ambition of the Russian Greens is
to remove all other industrial plants from around the lake. This, they say,
would make Baikal the symbol of the nation's struggle to repair the damage
caused by seven decades of profligacy.
Dr Olga Speranskaya, a Moscow ecologist, was the winner of the 1992 David
Thomas Prize set up in memory of David Thomas, a Financial Times journalist
killed on assignment in Kuwait in 1991. This article is part of her research
into Lake Baikal, undertaken with the prize money.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: At last, sherry really is
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIOUS anomaly in the UK wine world is now being removed. So-called
British 'sherry,' made from imported grape concentrate, has had a
diminishing tax advantage over the real thing: sherry made from fresh grapes
in the Jerez district of Spain. By the end of 1995, this preference will
have been wiped out.
It arose because British sherry was allowed to pay the same tax as table
wine, now 95p a bottle. But most real sherry pays Pounds 1.63 - and, until
this year, Pounds 1.88 if between 18` and 22` in alcoholic strength.
More important than the tax, however, is the ruling that, from 1996, the
word 'sherry' cannot be used in the European Community for wines that have
been labelled as British, Irish, Australian or South African sherry. The
Spaniards should have won this battle long ago but the British sherry lobby
fought to retain the word on its labels.
Moreover, no longer do fortified wines - sherry, port and madeira - have to
pay a higher duty of Pounds 3 a case if between 8` and 22`. There is now
only one rate, which means an initial 5p a bottle off the low-strength wines
and an encouraging 30p on the stronger wines, plus VAT. By the beginning of
1996, the duty on low-strength sherries will have fallen by Pounds 3.78 a
case and by Pounds 7.43 on those of high strength - subject, of course, to
the actions of the chancellor in the intervening budgets.
These reforms provide, at the right time of year, an incentive to sample the
warming old high-strength sherries from Jerez. The amontillados, olorosos
and palo cortados from old soleras started many years ago and, unblended
with the sweet pedro ximenex (PX) wines, have a concentrated aroma, deep
flavour and dry finish that make them delicious aperitifs.
Amontillado. Cheap amontillados are no more than sweetened finos, but the
genuine article must be at least eight years old before it is transformed
naturally. Lighter than olorosos, they also have a long taste in the mouth.
Sainsbury has an attractive amontillado that is claimed to have an average
age of 35 years (Pounds 3.45 a half). A very reputable one is Valdespino's
Tio Diego (Wine Society, Stevenage, Hertfordshires, Pounds 7.90).
Outstanding, however, is Gonzalez Byass's Amontillado del Duque Viejo
(Peatling, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, Pounds 19.49), which is wonderfully
rich and concentrated with a bone-dry finish.
Oloroso. Normally regarded as a sweet wine - with the low-strength Bristol
Cream (Pounds 5.62 in most supermarkets) being the best known - it can, in
fact, provide the most satisfying, concentrated sherry with a dry finish at
a very reasonable price.
Safeways has Lustau's excellent, full-bodied dry old oloroso (Pounds 3.29 a
half-bottle). The Wine Society lists Valdespino's very concentrated Viejo
Oloroso (Pounds 7.15). Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester, Essex, has Oloroso
Especial (Pounds 7.56) from the reputable firm of Hidalgo.
Wine Cellars, 153-155 Wandsworth High Street, London, includes Valdespino's
Don Gon-Zalo Dry Oloroso (Pounds 9.69). Philip Eyres of Coleshill, Amersham,
Buckinghamshire, lists the distinctive Lustau dry oloroso, Viejo de Jerez
(Pounds 10.86).
Palo Cortado. Between an amontillado and an oloroso in style, this is said
to be a one-in-3,000 cask rarity, so any offered cheaply should be treated
warily. It has a crisper taste than oloroso. Harvey's has an authentic 1796
Palo Cortado for Pounds 9.50 (Wine Society Pounds 9.60), while Wine Cellars
has Valdespino's Del Carrascal (Pounds 9.69). Those looking for something
outstanding might try the PP Solera, founded in 1922, from the London
department store, Selfridges (Pounds 20.99).

FT  27 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Try fino to wash down those tapas - Giles
MacDonogh samples Andalusian cuisine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TAPAS of Andalusia can be delightfully simple, much more so than those
prepared in such more prestigious gastronomic regions of Spain as the Basque
country or Catalonia. In the very fine Egana Oriza restaurant in Seville
(San Fernando 41, tel. 422 72 54), I had caper pickled on their thick stems
with thyme and garlic and the fattest green olives I had ever seen.
The style across the road at the ravishing Alfonso XIII Hotel (San Fernando
2, tel. 422 28 50) was appropriately ornate, the star dishes being those
fat, spicy little cocktail sausages called chistorras; monkfish marinated in
lemon juice and deep fried in batter; and the nuttiest, most delectable of
Jabugo hams or smoked loin.
Down on the coast, in the slightly dowdy fishing port of Puerto de Santa
Maria, there were razor fish and clams and shrimps cooked in batter. The
strangest tapa available was tigre, a mollusc which looked like a
scaled-down version of an old-fashioned custard cream cornet. Piles of these
monsters lay in the cool cabinets of the bars, their heads lolling drowsily
out of their shells until, sensing the presence of a hungry man, they
retracted swiftly into the false security of their carapaces.
A local speciality are the tiny red mullet, the size of whitebait, which are
served in the bars; or fish from the sole family, just 2in long when fully
grown, which are consumed whole - bones and all. As a special treat, my host
took me to a bar the size of a broom cupboard - then watched with
ill-concealed amusement as I ate an anonymous-looking tapa covered in bread
crumbs. This was a criadilla, or bull's testicle: a great delicacy available
only after the corrida.
In Andalusia, the drink favoured for washing down tapas of this sort is a
fino sherry or a glass of manzanilla. The fresh, tangy character of bone-dry
sherry seems the perfect accompaniment and not just for the fresh sea and
shell fish: it also matches Jabugo ham to perfection.
I returned from Andalusia, however, with one question unanswered: what do
you eat with the marvellous old solera sherries, amontillados and olorosos?
So I sought the help of John Bertram, a well-known London chef, and Gonzalez
Byass, a company based in Jerez near Sevilla, which is famed justly for the
quality of its old soleras.
It came as no surprise to anyone that the company's crisp Tio Pepe fino went
well with the fishy tapas - bread-crumbed balls of lobster; oysters grilled
swiftly under the lightest of gratins; red mullet cooked with garlic and
tomatoes; whitebait; or a proper Iberico ham from near Salamanca made from
the native breed of pig and allowed to munch freely on acorns. Where the
fino worked less well was with creamier foods.
The old soleras - the dry Amontillado del Buque with its huge nutty
character; the Apostoles, an oloroso with a fine, honeyed sweetness
overlaying an excellent bite; and the rich, sweet oloroso called Matusalem -
were not destined to be drunk with fish. My suspicion was they would be at
their best with Spanish cheeses.
The dry Duque proved the most versatile here, especially with the ewe's
milk, Manchego-style Guzman. The Duque was also good with the blue,
Cabrales-style Picos cheese with its acid tang but, in general, the tasters
prefered the fuller, sweeter style of the Apostoles with the blue cheese. It
was also voted the best partner for the meaty, goat's milk Cabra del Tietar,
and there were one or two people who found it went well with the Andalusian
goat's milk Sierra de Zuheros with its hard, soapy flavour.
The bigger old solera wines proved too flavoursome for the lighter, creamier
cheeses. A young Manchego was far better with Tio Pepe (in Spain, Manchego
is often served as a tapa with a glass of fino). Nor should it have
surprised anyone that the slightly salty, creamy Iberico cheese, made from
ewe's milk, should have married so well with the fino - salt and fino seem
suited ideally for one another.
Much more difficult was finding a partner for the super- sweet Matusalem. A
series of desserts created by Bertram were not ideal. Someone swore by its
effectiveness with Christmas pudding; but I felt it should be drunk on its
own, perhaps with some dried figs or a few walnuts.
Expect to pay between Pounds 6.99-7.99 for a bottle of Tio Pepe and between
Pounds 19.99 and Pounds 25 for any of the old solera wines (while stocks
last.
Oddbins is selling both the Duque and Matusalem at the bargain price of
Pounds 15.99). Stockists for the cheese include Harvey Nicholls (which also
stocks Iberico ham), Harrods and Selfridges shops (all in London); Valvona
and Crolla in Edinburgh; and the Fine Cheese Company in Bath.

FT  27 FEB 93 / How To Spend It: The Step
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Left, The Step, sweeping the US and going great guns in the UK, is just one
of the new-age devices for pleasurable exercise. In the two and a half years
since it was launched some 1 3/4 m have been sold.
While most of those have gone to clubs and other institutions there are now
two versions suitable for those who have neither the time, the means nor the
taste for communal exercising. The domestic versions mean that even the
shyest and most inhibited can deal with their flab and their bulges in the
privacy of their own homes, while those of us who are chronically busy and
short of time can tone up without having to travel anywhere.
There are two versions, the Step XT, which is 30in long and has three height
adjustments - 6, 8 and 10in - and costs Pounds 59.95. It is primarily used
for cross-training - that is swimmers who also run or tennis players who
want to get fitter but is an enjoyable way for the rest of us to improve our
cardiovascular fitness. The Step 2 is the more usual domestic version; it is
27in long with 4, 6 and 8in height adjustments. It costs Pounds 44.95. Both
are available from some 900 stores nationwide - in particular the sports
departments of Harrods, Lillywhites and John Lewis Stores.
They come with an accompanying video which it is absolutely essential to
follow, at least to begin with. How you stand, the body-line, how you move;
it all matters and the video nannies the novice along in a most encouraging
way. It aims to leave you bursting with renewed energy, not exhausted from
effort. As the handsome blond instructor puts it: 'You should be able to
talk at all times and a good test is whether you can sing along with the
music.' All nice, jolly, enjoyable stuff.
Below is the new, laid-back, easy-does-it way to dress for exercising - not
a shiny piece of Spandex in sight, colours are muted and low-key and the
clothes could as easily be worn for jogging, walking, or any other sport
that does not have too serious a dress code.
Her outfit is from Champion Sport, the great new name in sportswear. She is
wearing a grey marl leotard and street-cred, bulky shoes.
He keeps her company with loose and easy, drop shoulder T-shirt, slouch
socks, white towelling wrist bands and navy fleece tracksuit trousers, again
by Champion Sports. For your nearest stockist, ring 071-636-8040.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Food and Drink: Squeeze yourself a taste of Sicily - Cookery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I SHOULD be in Sicily this week attending a cookery course, sampling local
wines, exploring the markets and rejoicing in a scented snowdrift of almond
blossom. Alas, it was not to be, so I am comforting myself instead with the
sunny richness of Sicilian oranges now flooding into British shops.
There is no shortage of them and prices are reasonable. Most pleasing of
all, with their sticky, sweet, shockingly blood-stained juices, are the
moros and taroccos. I squeeze half a dozen or so for our breakfast each day,
a vibrant swig to zip us into action on grey English mornings, and I like to
serve these glorious fruits at the end of rich meals for dessert.
For the quickest and most dramatic effect, simply cut each orange, peel and
all, from top to bottom into eight wedges, remove the pips with the point of
a knife and pile the crescent-moon slices on to a plate. Allow two oranges
for every three people.
You might remember, as I do, oranges being served like this at half-time in
inter-school games. In those days, we used to save the pieces of orange peel
after we had sucked the juicy flesh from them. If you then carved the peel
with a penknife and wore it like a boxer's gumshield, you revealed a
gratifying flash of orange false teeth when you smiled.
I am not suggesting you indulge in such childish pranks at the dinner table.
But the simple refreshment can be given a sassy finishing touch by serving
the wedges on a plate lined with fresh bay leaves, and sprinkling them with
a smattering of lightly-crushed fennel seeds. The combination of fennel and
orange is lovely, and fennel is well known for its digestive properties.
Another aromatic alternative is to intersperse the wedges with sprigs of
rosemary. The blue flowers and silvery green foliage make a splendid foil
for the orange skin and ruby flesh of the fruit and, if the herb is bruised
lightly, it will impart some of its fragrance to the citrus.
This simplest of all orange salads can be served on its own, or with little
biscuits or sponge fingers also flavoured with fennel or rosemary. The fruit
also can be used as an edible garnish for scoops of blood orange sorbet.
Sweet oranges are suited equally for savoury roles. The Sicilians are fond
of combining them with fish, and I rate them highly with small birds such as
quail.
POT ROAST QUAIL WITH CARAMELISED ORANGES (serves 4)
Pot-roasting quail in the juice of blood oranges keeps the little birds
beautifully succulent. Extra fruit, grilled until slightly toffeed, provides
an irresistible garnish.
Ingredients: 8 plump oven-ready quail; 5 thin-skinned blood oranges; juniper
berries and bay leaves; 1 oz unsalted or clarified butter; a little olive
oil.
Method: Marinate the quail for a few hours in the juice and zest of 3
oranges with 8 bruised juniper berries. Turn the birds occasionally.
Dry the quail, reserving the marinade which will have stained them a pale
shade of beetroot. Skewer each one with a cocktail stick to tuck the legs
neatly against the body - this is less fiddly than trussing.
Choose a flame-proof casserole just large enough to take the little birds in
a single layer. Heat the butter in it and colour the quail lightly all over.
Then, lay them breast down and pour on the marinade. Without waiting for the
liquid to become hot, cover the casserole and pot-roast at 375-400F /
190-200C (gas mark 5-6) for 35 minutes.
Turn the birds breast up and cook for 10-15 minutes more. Then, serve
straight away or turn the oven temperature right down: pot-roast quail can
be 'held' for up to half an hour without spoiling.
Dish up the little birds in a nest of rice or other grain, or sit them on
rounds of grilled or fried polenta. Offer their gravy (lightly seasoned and
strained of spices and zest) in a sauce-boat, and serve with caramelised
oranges on the side.
To make these last, cut the remaining 2 oranges, peel and all, into 8 wedges
each. Thread on to damp wooden skewers, spacing the wedges well apart and
interleaving them with bay. Brush with olive oil and grill for about 10
minutes until the fruit is hot, the peel is slightly toffeed and the bay
leaves smell incense-sweet.

FT  27 FEB 93 / How to Spend It: For healthy bodies - and healthier minds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the curious things about the health and beauty business is that most
people - four out of five, according to Allied Dunbar's annual report on the
physical state of the nation - believe that some form of exercise is good
for them, but only half of them do anything about it. In other words, most
take the classic advice when overcome with the urge to deal with flab - they
sit down until they feel better. But slowly, more of us are realising that
fitness is not only good for us, it can also be fun. It can be about
enjoying yourself, meeting friends and colleagues in warm, congenial clubs,
and about feeling better, too.
As David Giampaolo, who founded the Espree clubs and now distributes fitness
equipment, puts it: 'These days the emphasis is much more on health than
fitness. It's about exercising in a way that is physically, psychologically
AND spiritually rewarding. The idea nowadays is to be energised, not
exhausted.'
The days of the Jane Fonda mantra, No Pain, No Gain, are gone. High-impact
aerobics, exercising till you drop, are out of vogue. In have come
low-impact aerobics, stretch and step, yoga, flotation, inline skating, Tai
Chi, dance - the key is to find something you actually enjoy - then there is
a chance that you might stick with it.
Fitness is also big business. The health, youth and fitness business is
predicted to be one of the five fastest growing commercial sectors in the
next decade - but as in all successful businesses, it needs sharp footwork
to keep ahead of the game.
With the emphasis on fun and (sign of the times) stress relief the
fashionable way to hone limbs and tone up cardiovascular function is with
such new age concepts as Step Training, Inline Skating, The Slide Trainer,
water aerobics and personal trainers. Crucial, too, are the ancillary
servies - aromatherapy, reflexology, massage, the holistic approach that all
the best, most advanced clubs now offer.
David Giampaolo was probably the first, with Espree, to see that most
1980s-style British clubs lacked allure. They were spartan and functional;
people came, worked out and went home. With Espree he made sure that a club
was a nice place to be - comfortable, inviting, warm, with a restaurant
serving decent food.
Nowadays many clubs are selling the new age message: that you need not
suffer to be beautiful and well. The Riverside Club, some of the David Lloyd
ones, the medium-market Metropolitan Clubs and lots of small health clubs up
and down the UK are all now more inviting to visit than the spartan clubs of
yesteryear.
The new Harbour Club at Watermead Lane, London SW6 (tel: 071-371-7700) is
not due to open until March 22 but so far is making all the right noises. It
describes itself as a multi-sports club with 14 tennis courts (10 indoors),
a 4,000 sq ft gymnasium, a 25 metre pool, a creche, good parking and every
sort of class from stretch and step, yoga and dance to flotation tank and a
proper restaurant with a serious chef (ex-Halcyon Hotel).
There is a resaleable membership fee of Pounds 1,695 and the monthly full
membership charge is Pounds 88. This lets you use all the facilities free
except the indoor tennis courts at peak time for which there is a Pounds 10
an hour charge. There will also be off-peak membership of Pounds 55 per
month and a joining fee of Pounds 430 for those who only use the club Monday
to Friday from 6.30am to 6pm. Some 900 people have already signed up.
For those for whom those kind of sums are out of the question it is worth
mentioning Jamie Addicoat's Fatbusters - wonderful name - classes. When I
last looked at the fitness business Addicoat's Fatbusters was running some
of the cheapest classes around, at Covent Garden's Jubilee Hall for Pounds
2.50 a class. Today prices have risen to just Pounds 4 a time. For that
reasonable sum you get Jamie himself, shouting, strutting, urging you on to
that (attainable) goal - the lean and trim body. Hours are for serious
workaoholics - 7.30 am on Monday, Tuesday and Thursdays, 7.15 pm on Tuesdays
and 1 pm on Sundays. Classes are held at the Jubilee Hall, 30, The Piazza,
Covent Garden, London WC2. Tel: 071-836-4007 for details.
The ultimate luxury (or necessity, depending on your point of view), is the
personal trainer. Puritanical Britons tend to feel this is the decadent way
to fitness but in New York, where personal trainers are nearly as ubiquitous
as personal analysts, they are seen as just another sensible use of
hard-pressed time. Trainers come in every discipline and though Pounds 35 an
hour (the average rate at which they come in London) may sound a lot, if you
get two or three friends to join it is good value.
My personal preference at the moment is for yoga: muscle toning, increased
suppleness and flexibility, not to mention a sense of renewed energy, are
just some of the benefits that yoga addicts notice. As evidence of my
devotion to my readers I proffer the name of my own much-valued yoga
teacher, Lisbeth Russell, tel: 071-431-2668, for those in the London area
who think yoga may be the thing for them. Otherwise the British Wheel of
Yoga Central Office (tel: 0529-306851) has a list of trained teachers in the
UK.
For other personal trainers - whether in low-impact aerobics, stretch and
step, body-sculpting - ring Melanie Reigber at Lifeworks (tel: 081-520-7344)
and she will put you in touch with teachers and classes in your area.
If you like keeping your physical inadequacies to yourself and just want to
work out in privacy at home there is now a vast range of in-home equipment
and supporting videos. The Step is currently much in vogue (see caption top
right) but the hot coming thing (according to David Giampaolo) is The Slide
Trainer, which should be in most sports shops in mid-March for Pounds 79.
Whereas most exercises work the front and back of the legs the Slide Trainer
promises (ah, delicious prospect) to stretch and tone the abductors (the
outside thigh muscles) and adductors (the inner ones). It also tones the
medial and lateral muscles on the inside and outside of the knee. So there
you have it - thinner thighs, stronger knees could be yours.
One last thought. The inescapable fact is that the toned body, the lithe
shape, the inner tranquillity does not come from the odd hour in the gym or
the couple of hours on the tennis court. It depends upon a whole way of
life. It reflects what you eat, how you move, how you feel and how you
exercise. Nothing is ever quite as simple as it seems . . .

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SO JUST what do you wear for all this new age exercise? Now that it is all
meant to be fun not penance, clothes are following suit - they look less as
if they are designed only for serious work-outs, and more like general
casual-wear.
Hot news from the West Coast of the US (whence most such fashions come) is
that body-hugging, muscle-revealing, neon-bright scraps of elasticated
fabrics are on the way out. It's bye-bye to the tight, show-off,
constricting garb that reveals every flabby inch and hello to loose,
comfortable, relaxed, shorts or sweat pants.
Bye-bye, too, (and not a minute too soon as far as I am concerned) to the
eyeball-searing colours and hello to nice, soft, understated grey, navy and
black and white. All the up-to-the-minute sports chains
such as Cobra, Champion, Sports Locker and the shops at the smartest clubs
are selling this new relaxed gear.
If you want a look that is wonderfully comfortable and yet has proper
gym-cred then, according to Graham Haines of Sports Locker (17 Floral
Street, London WC2 and 53 Pembridge Road, London W11), what you should go
for, working from the top down, is a reverse-weave Champion sweat-shirt
(Pounds 34.99, in lots of colours).
Underneath that you should don a loose Russell Athletic pocket T-shirt, then
some cotton-lycra knee-length pants (Pounds 34.99, smartest in
strongly-striped black and grey), and on your feet chunky cotton
socks by E G Smith (Pounds 10.99) which should be worn slouch-style - in
other words, rumpled round the ankles.
These are clothes 'with no gender barrier,' according to Graham Haines.
'Some 80 per cent of our merchandise is made for men but 40 per cent of it
is worn by women. These are clothes that you could wear to the gym, on the
street, or relaxing at home.'
At Cobra, (mail order from 75 Great Eastern Street, London EC2,
071-613-1776) they report, too, that it is 'wear what you want time.' People
are training in army trousers. Baggy light cotton training pants and baggy
tops with loose necklines are all the rage. The tops are worn over baggy
vests, the sleeves and trousers are rolled up.
Training shoes, it seems, are being swapped for training boots. Big belts
and crop tops are optional extras. Lots of customers, though, wear the baggy
look OVER a tight lycra outfit - those who have sweated for the body
beautiful and having got it are not about to keep it entirely covered up.
What all this means, of course, for the rest of us still hoping to get
there, is that now that we can trundle around in nice bulge-concealing gear
there is
even less of an excuse for not taking those self-same bulges off to the gym
. . .

FT  27 FEB 93 / Fashion: Navy and white: a classic combination cruises on -
Avril Groom welcomes fashion's equivalent of the first cuckoo of spring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AVRIL GROOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE shifting world of fashion it is comforting to find a rare constant.
As surely as spring follows winter, once the doors have closed on the greyed
and fingered remnants of the January sales the store-rails turn blue,
intermixed with white and cream.
There are fashion followers who await the first delivery of navy and white
as a sign of spring, much as keen birdwatchers record the first cuckoo. Once
the clothes arrive, they are inevitably labelled 'the nautical look' so it
is interesting that, in a year when the mood of fashion is totally removed
from the crisp uniformity of that epithet, this colour combination is as
strong as ever.
It is an easy look to market in the uncertain weather of early spring,
translating as well into the classic shapes and lightweight wools that sell
at that time as into the flimsy fabrics of high summer. But the appeal of it
goes much deeper than a brass-buttoned blazer. Navy and white is fresh and
optimistic after the heavy, dark shades of winter, and embodies the idea of
travel in its widest form. The nautical connotation suggests journeying for
pleasure to, or on, the sea, which even for the affluent used to be a summer
activity rather than an all-year option.
It also appeals to the human penchant for nostalgia for it goes back a long
way, to the original bloomered bathing-dress and the sailor-suits and
dresses which children wore early this century and which design leader
Gianni Versace has now exploited in the striped, sailor-collared shapes of
his couture collection for this summer.
By the 1920s travel had become a fashionable end in itself for the monied
and leisured, leading to a new genre of clothing, labelled first in America
and later in Europe as cruisewear. It is to the heyday of staterooms and
dinner at the captain's table that this year's navy and white harks back, to
the time when the rich shuttled across the Atlantic with complete suites of
Louis Vuitton flat-topped trunks in the hold of a liner.
Cruises now have a different image, requiring rather briefer and more
colourful clothing. But as the novelist Robert Louis Stevenson wrote more
than 100 years ago: 'Young and old, we are all on our last cruise,' and
recreating some of that lost elegance in the contemporary wardrobe is
seductively aspirational - even if we are only cruising to the office, a
dinner date or, at best, a villa in Tuscany by charter flight with one
holdall.
In the retro mish-mash of this spring's styles, inspired by the 1930s and
1940s as filtered by the 1970s, softness and lightness are the keywords. The
graceful, fluted lines created by the lightest fabrics, whether bias- or
generously-cut, are the gentlest and most flattering way to wear what may
seem, after years of power tailoring, an alien way of dressing. Certainly it
means giving up to some extent the comfort of more solid fabrics - so this
could well be the spring of the thermal vest.
Keep in the mind the elegance of old-style cruisewear and the look will fall
into place, from sporty casuals to dinner dress. There is no need to abandon
a tailored navy jacket, especially if it has pretensions to the curvy,
swashbuckling style favoured by designers Rifat Ozbek and Christian Lacroix,
but swap metal buttons for plain covered ones and make sure anything you
wear with it is meltingly fluid. A softly ruffled chiffon shirt and layered
chiffon skirt is the combination seen most often on the catwalks.
In the same vein, well-cut classic cream or white trousers still look right
but are no longer worn with a blazer - try a softly-wrapped jacket or loose
silk shirt instead. If you are buying new trousers, choose a loose, soft
shape, widening towards the ankle if you dare, in a fluid fabric - crepe is
the season's big hit. The same fluidity applies to dresses, which need a
swing in their long skirts, or at least a split to give a similar but sexier
effect.
Accessories are important - go for large, soft-brimmed, face-framing hats
rather than nautical caps, the new, rounded-looking, platform-soled shoes,
and use jewellery sparingly in the form of long, simple bead ropes, plain
but chunky bangles or Art Deco-inspired earrings.
But the final strength of this colour scheme is its universality. Some find
it works better with white, others with cream, but there is hardly anyone it
does not suit at all.
If you go for colour analysis you will learn that there are many shades of
navy - picked out for you will be 'your' navy, the one that suits you best.
Finding that exact shade in the shops will be another matter - but rest
assured that some store, somewhere, has the navy wherewithal to give you the
elegance of cruising times past.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Fashion: Breaking the secret dress code - The foibles and
follies of fashion etiquette
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRENDA POLAN

<TEXT>
THE STORY is claimed by most of London's great hotels but the maitre'd of
the Dorchester's grill room swears he was there. It was a busy evening late
in the 1960s and a glamorous couple approached the restaurant to claim their
table. He was dressed impeccably in a dark suit with well-pressed trousers.
So was she. Unfortunately, the prevailing dress code stipulated that
trousers were not acceptable attire for women.
Politely, the maitre'd pointed this out. She argued. After all, her Yves
Saint Laurent tunic-topped trouser suit was then the hottest thing in
fashion. He insisted. Her escort began to look anxious, so the lady turned
her back, unzipped her pants, stepped out of them and turned back, now
apparently wearing a mini dress. The maitre'd gulped, then grinned and
showed them to their table. He even checked her trousers into the cloakroom.
A skirt, it seems, is a skirt even if it merely skims the welt of your
tights. Or is it? At around the same time, model Jean Shrimpton discovered
that the stewards at Flemington racecourse in Melbourne did not think so.
Even today, very short skirts are barred at the Henley rowing regatta. And
there are still some places where women cannot wear trousers, including the
royal enclosure during even the chilliest, windiest Ascot week.
Dress codes often appear irrational, the tool of an old guard fighting a
rearguard action against the forces of progress, modernity, good sense and
egalitarianism. The new, American-owned Regent Hotel on Marylebone Road has
launched itself with a wordy, full-page advertisement which makes just that
assumption. 'Several hotels in London,' it declares, under a photograph of a
tail-coated concierge, 'are about a hundred years old. Trouble is, their
staff behave roughly the same age.'
It announces that, at the Regent, you can wear what you like. The London
Evening Standard took up the challenge with a semi-luminous turquoise, black
and orange shell suit. It was met with faultless charm and total acceptance.
The reporter felt like an eyesore, though. And that, according to Lucinda
Buxton, press officer for London's famous Savoy hotel - an establishment in
the forefront of the 'proud to be stuffy' movement - is partly what dress
codes are all about. 'If you know you are dressed right, it gives you
confidence,' she says. 'It enables you to respond to the glamour of your
surroundings - surroundings which a large number of people have worked very
hard to make perfect.'
There are, of course, two sides to that coin. Those who know the rules and
adhere to them feel secure. Those who do not are excluded, sometimes quite
peremptorily.
All rules about clothing are designed to be exclusive. Once, when the social
pecking order was of greater importance than it is now, they were enshrined
in the law of the land. The sumptuary laws made certain that no ambitious
member of the merchant or professional classes could deck themselves out in
the fabrics, furs and coronets reserved for the aristocracy, so deceiving
the unwary as to their station in life.
Formal academic dress still contains remnants of this status system but most
dress codes are informal, implicit and subtle - and enforced just as
rigorously. Watch any group of teenagers milling around on the pavement
outside a popular club and you will see the pariah space isolating the ones
who do not look right. Behold the doorkeeper's eyes as they slide over the
non-conforming outsiders as if the space they occupy was empty.
The decision on what is appropriate wear tends to be a consensus one formed
by the particular group. Those who flout that consensus are, quite rightly,
perceived as subversive and escorted to the exit (or, in the commonest case,
to the gentlemen's cloakroom where they will be offered a choice of
polyester ties and old-fashioned dacron jackets).
'Women nowadays,' says Buxton, 'can get away with almost anything. Except
maybe jeans or a shell suit. The strictest rules apply to men.' In most of
London's 'stuffy' hotels - the Savoy, Claridges, the Dorchester or the Ritz
 -a tie is required only in the evening and in the restaurant, but a jacket
is a must at all times except in the upper corridors.
And yet, it can often be a matter of discretion, as all the arbiters of
dress codes concede eventually. If one of those utterly chic Milanese men
approached the restaurant wearing an Armani jacket, well-pressed jeans,
Gucci shoes and a tie-less soft white silk shirt buttoned to the neck, no
one would dream of thrusting a soup-stained polyester tie at him. Dress
codes do give way before stylishness, fashion, wit and confidence.
In 1965, the Savoy turned trouser-clad pop guru Cathy McGowan away hungry.
But, in 1967, it reversed its policy and allowed Lady Whitmore, the
Swedish-born wife of racing driver Sir John Whitmore, to eat her dinner
unharassed and betrousered. After her, the deluge.
Wit and style does not always work, though. One of the Savoy grill's dearest
memories is of the time the mime artist, Marcel Marceau, arrived on the
threshold without a tie. On being told he could go no further, he mimed
tying a Windsor knot in front of an imaginary mirror. The seated diners
applauded rapturously. Marceau was, nevertheless, escorted to the
gentlemen's cloakroom to choose his tie.

<TEXT>
'THIS accounts package does not work] It can't even calculate VAT on my
invoices properly.' The voice at the other end of the line was accusing;
after all, only a few months ago I had recommended the package in question
as a Best Buy in one of the Personal Computer magazines.
I asked the gentleman to send me a copy of his disks and some of the faulty
invoices. The problem soon became clear. His business was wine retailing
where prices are quoted inclusive of VAT. He wanted to invoice a
VAT-inclusive gross price such as Pounds 3.99 and for the computer to
automatically calculate net price and VAT. Unfortunately, accounts packages
normally expect you to enter the VAT-exclusive net price and to calculate
VAT and gross. Each method of calculation yields slightly different VAT
amounts. He needed both, since some of his sales invoices were for wine in
bond which is quoted at VAT-exclusive prices.
Now whether or not this Pounds 299 budget package should have offered both
methods for calculating VAT is arguable. The important point is that the
wine merchant, when he started looking for an accounts package, had no idea
that his invoicing requirements were unusual and might present a problem. He
thought he just had to go out and buy an accounts package which did
invoicing.
When you buy a computer vague objectives such as 'I want it to do my
invoicing,' or 'I want it to handle stock control' are not good enough, for
at the nuts and bolts level at which computers operate there are endless
permutations of invoicing or stock control and you have to know precisely
which versions you need. Without a doubt, the key to buying a computer
system that works is first to define in detail the tasks the computer will
be required to carry out. Before looking at solutions, first spend some time
defining the problem. This can save you hours of frustration and wasted time
later on.
The more effort you put into setting down a detailed specification before
you start looking at computers, the easier your search will be. The
prospective buyer who starts armed with even a thorough 'spec' will have a
clear view of what he is looking for, and this helps him keep his eye on the
ball as he wades through all the jargon and technical irrelevancies with
which the computer vendors will inevitably assail him.
In the computer industry this document is referred to as a 'specification of
requirements' or 'system Specification'. Writing one is a skilled task
normally performed by a 'systems analyst'. It requires experience both of
business (in order to understand how the current manual system works) and
also of computers (how a computer system could replace it). A systems
analyst is the key person in any computer purchase since he or she is the
only person involved who has an understanding of both areas. Such
individuals are rare, and competent systems analysts tend to work for big
companies or the more expensive dealers.
For the smaller company that wants to computerise, perhaps the best route is
to have its specification of requirements written by a consultant under the
DTI Enterprise Scheme.
The Enterprise Scheme applies to individuals, companies or partnerships in
manufacturing or services employing fewer than 500 people. The majority of
DTI projects are done for businesses with 20 employees or less. Under the
Financial and Information Systems Initiative, you can employ a consultant to
define your specification for you. The DTI will pay half, or in some cases
two-thirds, of the cost. Minimum time for the project is five working days,
maximum 15 days.
As a consultant, I invariably get my customers to apply for an FMIS subsidy
under the Enterprise scheme. The FMIS Initiative is an important scheme
which ought to be more widely publicised. The client is guaranteed a
reasonable level of competence (all consultants are screened before they are
allowed to go on the DTI register).
One disadvantage is that it concerns itself entirely with producing the
system specification which, while essential, is simply a means to achieving
an end, that is a working computer system. Make it clear to your consultant
at the outset, that you do not just want a big report for your money; you
expect the computer to be installed and working. For this a further five
days subsidy is available for 'implementation guidance.'
The first step is to telephone your regional DTI branch for the brochure and
an application form. But hurry] The DTI Enterprise scheme is scheduled to
end in 1994.
DTI Greater London, call 071-627-7800. For other regions phone the DTI's

FT  27 FEB 93 / Minding Your Own Business: Insurer who entered a minefield -
David Spark meets a former Lloyd's broker who now clears mines for a living
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID SPARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS quite a leap from years as a Lloyd's broker to heading a company
clearing mines in the semi-desert of northern Somalia. But that is the leap
Maurice Brackenreed Johnston has made and already it shows results.
Brackenreed Johnston lost his job in October 1989 when Jardine Insurance
Brokers, where he was deputy chairman, was reorganised.
'I had no idea what to do,' he recalls. 'I was 54, with children at school.
I knew I didn't want to work for anyone else again.'
Brackenreed Johnston heard that Sir David Stirling, founder of the Special
Air Services, was worried about his businesses, one in security, the other
fighting rural crime in Scotland. The businesses were beyond saving, says
Brackenreed Johnston, but 'rural crime sounded fun'. He and Sir David formed
Rimfire to combat poaching in Africa, but Sir David died from a stroke six
weeks later.
Rimfire's first sniff of work came in the Middle East, when it pitched for a
contract to train special forces in the United Arab Emirates. The timing was
bad. 'We put our bid in on the day the Gulf War started and that was the end
of it.'
Through the ill-fated UAE project, Brackenreed Johnston met a mine disposal
expert, Mick Fellows, who soon had a chance to prove his worth.
Aris Grammaticas, a Rimfire shareholder based in Nairobi, reported that two
German nurses had been injured by mines in northern Somalia. Both German
Emergency Doctors and the French Medecins sans Frontieres were keen for the
mines to be cleared. Could Rimfire help?
Northern Somalia has escaped the hunger besetting the south; but it was
fought over for 15 years. The war between Somalia and Ethiopia left
minefields along the frontier, and in the later civil war against President
Barre, mines were sown indiscriminately: under shade trees, by water holes,
in houses.
'The people working for me have never seen anything like it, anywhere in the
world,' says Brackenreed Johnston.
He undertook the Somali contract, he says, out of arrogance and ignorance.
He enlisted Fellows's help and did a survey. A professional clearing
operation would cost hundreds of millions of pounds. He proposed instead to
recruit British ex-service men to train and supervise local people.
Brackenreed Johnston went to see Abdul Rahman, president of the Somali
National Movement. 'We like the British,' said the president. 'But if you
train these local people you have to pay them.'
'But they'll be working for you,' said Brackenreed Johnston
'We haven't any money,' said Rahman.
Brackenreed Johnston went to the Overseas Development Administration in
London. 'I'd never even heard of ODA before,' he recalls.
He went to US Aid in Washington, to the European Community and to the UN
High Commission for Refugees in Geneva which was keen to move Somali
refugees from Ethiopian camps. He won a contract worth Pounds 1.75m with
UNHCR and from US Aid (Pounds 490,000), the European Community (Pounds
530,000), Medecins sans Frontieres backed by the Dutch government (Pounds
350,000) and the ODA (Pounds 400,000).
Rimfire usually has 12 red-overalled ex-navy and army engineers in Somalia,
who can earn over Pounds 40,000 a year. They work two months on, one month
off.' It's a pretty rotten and miserable job,' says Brackenreed Johnston.
They have trained 440 Somali pioneers who, wearing flakjackets and visored
helmets, dig with spikes into the ground ahead of them for mines or for hand
grenades, often with the pins missing. The ordnance came from Pakistan,
Egypt, Britain, Russia, Czechoslovakia, Italy. It includes SAM missiles,
35ft long, leaking toxic fumes.
One mine is like a vacuum flask top. Another, like a pencil box, is
attractive to children who make up many of the casualties. Brackenreed
Johnston says that for every soldier hurt in combat by a mine, 30 civilians
are hurt by mines later.
The initial idea was to clear the frontier mines so that refugees could go
home. However, this simply put them at risk in mined villages, so the policy
changed. Brackenreed Johnston says that to make the risk to life and limb
acceptable will take five more years.
Hargeisa is 200 miles of bad, hazardous road away from the port Djibouti.
Brackenreed Johnston has had to take money there himself, hitching a lift to
Hargeisa on relief agency aircraft. Hiring lorries is costly. Rimfire drove
its own vehicles to Hargeisa, only for them to be stolen or commandeered by
armed locals.
The pioneers, employees of the local government, grumble that their
allowances from Rimfire are small. Accidents raise the question of
insurance, for which the aid agencies allocated no money. Two pioneers have
been killed and 11 hurt in mine accidents and two Rimfire employees have had
amputations after explosions. Casualties in shooting incidents have been
higher: five dead and 17 injured. Two of the house staff working for Rimfire
have been shot and killed.
Brackenreed Johnston says he finds the Somalis difficult to help. From their
early teens many carry AK47s and take the drug qat, brought in by armed
convoys from Ethiopia. 'The only effective businesses are the drugs trade
and Rimfire. There is no work, and the only way to get money is by theft. We
are in the middle of this.'
Rimfire, apart from its Somali work, has surveyed the minefields of northern
Angola and is interested in clearing mines in the Falklands.
Brackenreed Johnston expects it to show a Pounds 100,000 profit on a Pounds
2.75m turnover in the year to May 1993. Rimfire made Pounds 35,000 last year
and lost Pounds 100,000 the year before when it was starting up. Brackenreed
Johnston has financed the business with an overdraft of Pounds 240,000 and
with Pounds 140,000 cash put up by himself and two fellow shareholders in
Spain and Kenya.

I AM A married woman with no earned income. A large part of my unearned
income has been paid gross by virtue of me completing the relevant R85
forms. I now find I have exceeded my personal allowance for the present tax
year by about Pounds 125. Am I liable for tax on this Pounds 125 or on all
of my gross income?
You must, of course, tell each bank or building society that you are not, in
fact, entitled to receive interest without deduction of tax (although you
thought that you would be, when you signed the R85s). When your tax position
comes to be sorted out, after the end of the tax year, you will only
actually end up bearing tax (at 20 per cent) on the excess over your
personal allowance.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet IR10 (A guide for people with
savings); this is a new version of IR110 (with a new title), and supersedes
pamphlets IR111 and IR112 as well.

I HAVE moved house four times since settling in Scarborough 20 years ago and
have used the same pleasant, normally-efficient solicitor each time. But at
the end of last year he told me apologetically that, because of an
oversight, we had not been charged for our last house purchase in October
1987. We have more or less decided to pay without too much argument but
would like to know if there any time limit on presenting a bill for services
rendered?
There is a time limit of six years from the date when the money first became
due, after which the right to recover the money becomes statute-barred. As
the fees will not have been due to the solicitor until the completion of
your purchase, it would appear that he has realised his error just in time.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Rental revenue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I OWN AN apartment in France which is let for part of the year. Tax returns
are prepared for me by an agency in France and I have received tax demands
from Paris, usually two years delayed. This income has been declared to the
British tax inspector. My UK accountant maintains I will have to pay UK tax
on the rental income, and obtain a refund if and when the French tax demand
exceeds the UK demand. Is this correct?
France has the prior right to tax your rental income (by virtue of article 5
of the France-UK double taxation convention) and the UK has to reduce its
tax demands by the amount of the French tax, broadly speaking, under article
24(a) of the convention. It looks as though your accountant ought to have
submitted repayment claims to your UK tax office each time you paid French
tax.
The rules are outlined in a free pamphlet, IR6 (Double taxation relief),
which is obtainable from most tax offices.
For the purpose of calculating the relief from UK tax to which you are
entitled, each amount of French tax has to be translated to sterling at the
rate of exchange for the day on which it was due for payment (regardless of
when it was actually paid). This will be a quite different rate of exchange
from that which was used to translate the relevant rental income, of course,
so it is not simply a question of comparing the French tax rate with the
rate of tax charged in the UK.
It is a pity that you did not say when the letting started, as that would
have enabled us to give you a simpler answer; but your remark about the
French tax demands being 'usually two years delayed' indicates it started
some years ago.
The case V assessment for either the third UK tax year or the fourth
presumably was based upon the same rent as the previous year's assessment
(viz, the second or the third, as the case may be), so that your accountant
will have to claim the special relief provided by section 804 of the Income
and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (or section 510 of the Income and Corporation
Taxes Act 1970, if the year in question was 1987-88 or earlier).
If your accountant is concerned about having let time limits slip by, he
might find comfort in section 806(2) of the Taxes Act 1988.

MY WOMAN friend and I wish to have a long-term relationship without making
any legal commitment. We would pursue our separate careers from separate
households but would leave open the long-term possibility of becoming a
single household, with or without a formal marriage.
Can our public description of each other create an implied legal commitment?
If we referred to ourselves as fiance(e)s, for example, would it be possible
for one partner at a later date to argue that, legally, marriage had been
implied, or even offered? Would it be advisable to draw up some legal
agreement in order to secure the certainty that no legal commitment is in
any way created accidentally?
While the use in public of a description such as you mention would not, of
itself, give rise to any change in your legal status or liability towards
each other, the use of the particular expression 'fiance(e)' might be
relied-on at some future date as evidence to support a claim that there had
been a contract to enter into marriage. It would be wiser to use some such
term as 'partner,' which is not indicative of an agreement to marry.
A formal agreement which disavows expressly any intention to become married
would help, but it would operate only from the date of the document and
would not preclude an assertion that there had been a subsequent change of
heart and an agreement to marry.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Better to be safe than sorry -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu searches out the best places to store valuables
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
JEWELLERY, cash and cocaine were among an estimated Pounds 40m worth of loot
hauled away by thieves who broke into a London safe deposit centre in 1987.
The robbery - masterminded by an Italian, Valerio Viccei, who went on to
write a book about it - made a mockery of safety deposit centres. But such
crimes are few and far between and, since insurance premiums on items such
as jewellery can be prohibitively high, they are likely to be far safer kept
in a bank than at home.
Most of the high street banks provide safe custody services at their main
branches but conditions and charges vary. Of the banks quoted, only Midland
does not charge an 'access' fee - the amount you have to pay every time you
go to inspect your box. Banks will not charge for keeping documents obtained
through their services, such as a will drawn up by them or certificates for
shares bought through them.
You will be required to provide your own box and key but the banks do not
want to know what is being kept in it. Insurance is left to the discretion
of the depositor - most insurance companies will reduce their rates if you
tell them that the items are being held in a bank.
The services offered by Lloyds, Midland and Royal Bank of Scotland are for
their own customers only. Rates given by Bank of Scotland, Midland and
Lloyds include VAT.
Sealed envelopes. The annual charge for holding individual certificates
ranges from Pounds 5 a certificate to Pounds 15 but it is much cheaper to
keep valuable documents in one envelope. Charges for an envelope, generally
no bigger than A4 size, are Pounds 5 a year at National Westminster and
Royal Bank of Scotland.
The charges at Barclays are Pounds 5 a quarter, and Pounds 10 a year at
Lloyds and TSB. Bank of Scotland charges Pounds 2 half-yearly. Midland's
charge is Pounds 9.98 but there are no charges for access.
Small boxes or parcels. The cost is Pounds 20 a box per year at Lloyds and
NatWest and Pounds 5 a quarter at Barclays. The minimum charge at Royal Bank
of Scotland is Pounds 15 a year and Pounds 8 per half-year at Bank of
Scotland. Midland's fee is Pounds 19.97 a year.
Larger boxes or parcels. The charge is Pounds 50 a year at Lloyds and Pounds
10 a quarter at Barclays. NatWest is cheaper, with an annual fee of Pounds
30.
Bank of Scotland will charge a half-yearly fee of either Pounds 16 or Pounds
32, depending on the size of the box. The annual cost at Midland is Pounds
27.02 for a medium size box and Pounds 39.95 for larger boxes.
Access. Only at the Midland will you escape fees for inspecting your box or
envelope. At Royal Bank of Scotland, the charge is Pounds 3 a visit to box
or sealed envelope, to a maximum of Pounds 12 for any visit. Bank of
Scotland charges Pounds 2 for an inspection, and the fee at NatWest and
Lloyds is Pounds 5. Barclays says access charges are at the manager's
discretion.
If you want more secure facilities, the Midland is able to hold items in
safety deposit boxes which are built into reinforced concrete strongrooms at
some of its largest branches in London, Manchester and other big cities. You
need to be a customer or to have a letter of introduction from another bank.
There are two locks on the box; the key to one is kept by the bank and the
other by the customer. But the service does not come cheap. Charges are
Pounds 67.85 a year for the smallest size of about 2in x 7in x 20in, up to
Pounds 2,972.75 for what amounts to a small room (7ft x 4ft 6in x 6ft 6in).
The Chancery Lane Safe Deposit Co., which owns the London Silver Vaults,
boasts a pedigree dating back to 1882. Access to the vaults is past
custodians in cubicles, through a series of steel doors and electronic
security devices, and with the help of a password.
Customers have to sign a form declaring they are not storing 'noxious
substances' and are given the 'only key in the world' to their box.
There are 40 different sizes of safe, with annual rental costs ranging from
Pounds 42.27 to Pounds 570.30. There are no inspection charges.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Own your home tax-free - Caroline
Graham ends her series on property and the Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU ARE not domiciled in the UK, you will not pay tax on any income or
property which you earn or own outside the country. But if you buy a house
or property in Britain, you could become liable to UK tax on the money
needed for the purchase; on any profit made when you sell it; or if you die
while owning it.
There are, however, legitimate ways of avoiding these levies.
If you need to bring in money to buy a house, the best way is to do this
before you become UK-resident; then, no tax is due. But if you cannot, there
are ways of converting a fund mixed with untaxed income and gains into one
that is non-taxable. Examples include setting up a back-to-back loan, making
a gift offshore, or creating an offshore trust.
If you have brought in substantial sums of money from a mixed fund, you
could be liable to tax already - although it could be difficult to work out
how much. In my experience, however, the Inland Revenue is fair in such
circumstances and often willing to negotiate if you co-operate.
Once you have decided how to buy your house, you should consider whether you
will have to pay capital gains tax if you profit from selling it. If you
plan to live there, it could be exempt from tax as your main or only
residence. But if you have another residence, anywhere else in the world,
you should ask the Revenue to treat your new house as your tax-exempt
residence. This request should be made within two years of buying the
property; after that, the Revenue could decide not to accept your choice.
If the exemption is not available, you might consider buying the property
through a non-UK trust. CGT is not charged on gains made by an offshore
trust set up by a non-UK domiciled settlor.
The next thing to consider is inheritance tax. If you are going to buy the
house in your own name, or in the name of an offshore trust, then
inheritance tax at a maximum rate of 40 per cent will be payable when you
die unless you leave the property to your spouse.
If you decide not to do this, or are concerned that you and your spouse
could die together, you can take out term insurance, especially if your stay
in the UK is unlikely to be long - say, five years at the most.
If this solution fails to suit, you can avoid IHT simply by owning the house
through an offshore company. You will then effectively have swapped a UK
chargeable asset (your house) for a non-UK, non-chargeable asset (shares) in
the offshore company.
In theory, this solution is simple but, in practice, there are
disadvantages. You must not, for example, be seen to be managing or
controlling the company from Britain. If you do, you will make it
UK-resident and defeat the purpose.
Another pitfall is an income tax charge under the benefit-in-kind
legislation. The Revenue has said it will levy tax if you live in a property
owned by an offshore company if you are either a director (either in name or
in effect) or own it. Tax charged is particularly onerous and is based on
the cost of the house (if over Pounds 75,000) and the rate of interest at
the time.
Many tax experts believe the Revenue is wrong to levy this charge; but while
the threat is there it should, where possible, be avoided. This usually can
be achieved by not being a director of the company and transferring your
shares in the company to an offshore trust.
Again, care must be taken over the trust to which you transfer your shares.
If you use an existing trust containing accumulated income, you might find
yourself being taxed on that income because of the benefit to you of the UK
accommodation.
If you want to let the house, the rental income will be taxable since it
arises in the UK. This can be avoided by taking out a loan from a UK bank
(or an offshore branch of a UK bank - but not a building society) to buy the
property.
The interest can then be set off against the rent and the money which,
otherwise, you would have used to buy the property can be deposited
offshore, generating an income which will be tax-free because it is outside
the UK.
There are many ways of avoiding tax, even on UK-situated assets, if you are
not domiciled in Britain. But make certain you are not - otherwise you could
face a larger tax bill than if you had done nothing at all.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Unloved Electra battles to overcome
suspicions - Philip Coggan on the performance of a very different financial
animal / Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRA is a completely different animal from the other trusts profiled so
far in this series: one statistic makes that clear. Shares in some of the
popular trusts, such as TR City of London, stand close to asset value, or at
a premium; Electra shares are trading at a 34 per cent discount.
What makes Electra shares so apparently unpopular is that the trust
specialises in unquoted investments. There have been so many disasters in
trusts of this kind - at Drayton Consolidated and Ensign, for example - that
investors have become naturally suspicious.
As the graph shows, recent performance has been poor. Net asset value at the
end of the trust's last financial year was still below its level at the end
of September 1987, and was nearly 20 per cent below its peak at end
September 1989. In the wake of that decline and the widening of the
discount, the shares have underperformed the All-Share substantially early
in the 1990s.
The recession has tended to be the problem. Unquoted companies often are
small and concentrated on a particular sector, so they are vulnerable to a
downturn in their area. Electra also had investments in many major
management buyouts; such companies normally have high borrowings and thus
suffered heavily from high interest rates when Britain was in the exchange
rate mechanism. And liquidity is a problem; it is difficult to sell a stake
in an unquoted company in the middle of a recession.
All these problems have, inevitably, led to questions about the valuation of
Electra's stocks. There is normally an element of subjectivity in valuing an
unquoted portfolio; and investors have been alarmed by the drastic
write-downs of assets announced by other trusts in the sector. What the wide
discount on Electra's shares seems to indicate is that the market fears that
its valuations might be over-optimistic.
The trust argues that it follows the guidelines set down by the British
Venture Capital Association in this field; in its annual report, it cites
its 'prudent and consistent view' on valuation. Over a third of its unquoted
holdings are valued with reference to market prices, it says.
Electra grew out of the old Cable &amp; Wireless company, as a vehicle for
holding the group's overseas licences. When C&amp;W was nationalised in 1948,
Electra was left as a separate investment company, eventually becoming part
of the empire of Globe, once the UK's largest investment trust.
The trust is managed by Electra Kingsway, which also runs a large private
partnership fund investing in development stocks. The investment trust takes
part in the same deals as the private fund.
Electra is an international trust; it has 34 per cent of its assets in the
US, where the recovery seems to have started; and if recovery also comes to
the UK, small companies on both sides of the Atlantic will benefit. Lower
interest rates have already eased the problems of the more heavily-borrowed
companies.
Electra is by far the largest investment trust in the development capital
sector, with a market capitalisation of around Pounds 370m. Investments are
made by five teams of executives (three in the UK, one in the US and one in
France) who work for managing director Hugh Mumford; there is a further team
of ex-industrialists which monitors the companies in the portfolio.
Because of its concentration in unquoted stocks, private investors may not
have heard of many of the trust's 10 largest holdings. At September 30, they
were Nimex Resources, Parker Pen, Unipart, German government bonds, Head
Insurance, Ryan Group, RJR Associates, Electra Kingsway Managers, Jarvis
Hotels, and Orthofix International Investments.
The Parker Pen investment shows how one success can make up for many
disappointments in the venture capital area. After selling off various
tranches of its holding, the effective original cost of Electra's investment
in Parker is just Pounds 100,000; the value of its holding (dependent on a
bid from Gillette) at end-September was Pounds 23.6m.
The question for investors is whether the position of Electra represents a
buying opportunity. There are some bullish arguments. For a start, Electra
has proved the case for investing in unquoted stocks over the long term; its
net asset value has more than trebled since 1982 and it has increased its
dividend every year since it was listed in 1976. Furthermore, around 30 per
cent of Electra's portfolio is in quoted stocks, which help provide the
income to pay the dividend.
In another investment trust, such stocks might be valued on a discount of,
say, 10 per cent. That means the effective discount on the unquoted shares
is even greater than 34 per cent, and allows for a lot of bad news. But
Lewis Aaron, analyst at SG Warburg Securities, points out that unquoted
stocks tend to be valued on a historic basis. Accordingly, when Electra next
values its holdings, it will still feel the impact of the recession. It
could be some time, therefore, before the trust's net asset value moves
sharply upwards. And while the trust might be good value for the private
investor in the long term, Aaron says, there is not much prospect for growth
over the next six to nine months.
Key facts
In mid-December, when the trust last valued its assets officially, the net
assets per share were 297p. Its share price on Friday morning was 214p; and
County NatWest estimates the discount at 34.9 per cent.
The market capitalisation on Friday morning was Pounds 370m and the yield
was 4.2 per cent.
Board
Electra has a large board, with four executive and seven non-executive
directors. The executives are Michael Stoddart (chairman), Mumford, Clive
Clague and David Osborne; the non-executives include Tom King, the former
defence secretary, Lord Vinson, Sir Christopher Wates and Michael Pickard,
chairman of the London Docklands Development Corporation.
Savings scheme details
The minimum monthly investment into the savings scheme is Pounds 25, or
Pounds 250 for a lump sum. Maximum dealing charges are 0.25 per cent.
Because of its concentration in unquoted stocks, Electra does not qualify
for Pep status.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: A wealth of reading - Bernice Cohen
picks her best books for DIY investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNICE COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CRUCIAL element in being a Dimi (do-it-myself investor), running a share
portfolio based mainly on my own research efforts, is deciding on my
underlying philosophy.
Building a library of books on systems developed by successful investors was
one of six practical steps for improving my investment skills. But reading
books on other people's philosophy was a good route for discovering what
type of investor I am (although during this learning process it was hard to
stick to Jim Slater's excellent advice of finding and adopting a good system
and then working with it to improve results).
Some of my costliest mistakes arose from trying to copy someone's method
without realising it conflicted with my own attitudes. To minimise this
mismatch, I make notes on key points in these how-to-invest books. The
summaries then form a synopsis of my personal approach to investing.
Every library needs at least one basic reference guide to cope with the
jargon and other technicalities of investment. My choice is the Investors
Chronicle Beginners' Guide to Investment by Bernard Gray (Business Books
Limited, 1991). It is up to date and comprehensive enough to answer almost
every relevant question.
I found Jack Schwager's Market Wizards (Harper &amp; Row, 1989) an ideal choice
for an introduction to the many different investment approaches. His
interviews with 17 top traders contain plenty of philosophical worth. I was
attracted instantly to some and wanted more information: in particular,
about investing along the lines suggested in the William O'Neil interview.
Later, I discovered his book, How to Make Money in Stocks (McGraw-Hill,
1991), at Parks, the London specialist finance and accounting bookseller.
(It also has shops in Manchester, Birmingham and Glasgow and a catalogue
service). O'Neil is a growth investor par excellence and this book still
ranks as the one that has influenced me the most.
Another instructive read is John Train's The Midas Touch (Harper &amp; Row,
1987). It discusses the methods of Warren Buffett, one of the most
successful value investors of our time. Buffett's grasp of company
fundamentals is legendary: he buys undervalued situations and waits for the
market to catch up.
I do not trust my abilities enough to identify such situations (and lack
funds to exploit them, anyway). But this has allowed me to concentrate on
investment philosophies that suit my temperament. This has given me the
confidence to be a Dimi, relying totally on my own research and analysis
efforts to find good growth stocks.
Peter Lynch is another exceptional value investor: for many years, he
managed Fidelity's highly successful Magellan fund. His book, One Up On Wall
Street (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1989), is subtitled, 'How to use what you already
know to make money in the market.'
He suggests that anyone can ferret out good investment opportunities ahead
of the professionals by observing local businesses and industries. But my
greatest benefit was derived from his analysis of how to pick winners, and
his simple explanations of the crucial numbers that make up the basics for
stock selection.
His attitude to research is exemplary, and he writes: 'Investing without
research is like playing stud poker and never looking at the cards.'
In One Up On Wall Street, Peter Lynch introduces the term 'diworsification'
to describe companies that stray from their core businesses in search of
extra profits - often a disastrous move. I have adopted this word to
describe my difficulties in holding a large, diversified portfolio.
I have found that nurturing a few growth stocks with giant potentials (which
I call KPPs - King Penguin Potentials) has been more successful than tending
a larger clutch which, by the law of averages, must contain some
mediocrities. It is difficult to discover six really good growth situations,
so attempting to find 10 is my idea of diworsification.
Stan Weinstein is a growth investor whose book, Secrets for Profiting in
Bull and Bear Markets (Dow Jones-Irwin, 1988), deals exclusively with
American stocks. I have learnt a great deal from his chartist approach. US
investors get more company and chart information than those in the UK, but
the book is packed with material that applies anywhere, to any stock market.
He also gives detailed guidance on indicators for spotting the start of a
major bear or bull market.
The Zulu Principle (Orion, 1992) by another growth investor, Jim Slater,
gives good tips on picking growth shares, but I found the chapter on
recovery situations to be most interesting, especially since many such
opportunities should arise this year if the economy emerges from recession.
Finally, Blood in the Streets (1988) and The Great Reckoning (1992) by James
Davidson and Lord William Rees-Mogg (Sidgwick and Jackson) give excellent
overviews of the political and economic forces which increasingly affect
investment strategies.
Although some financial books have a reputation for being hard to read and
expensive, I enjoy building my library and feel it amply repays the time
involved.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Insurance salesmen get a blast -
Complaints to ombudsman soar over life policy deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSURANCE industry's referee, Dr Julian Farrand, this week blew the
whistle on some of the selling practices of salesmen. The annual report of
the insurance ombudsman showed total complaints had risen 29 per cent from
the year before to 5,576 in 1992. But life insurance cases accounted for a
much steeper increase of 41 per cent - more than one-third of his workload.
The ombudsman deals with both general and life insurance and resolves
disputes with customers who are unhappy with the way a complaint has been
handled by their insurance company.
Farrand attributes the rise in life assurance cases to the increasing
complexity of policies and the failure of some salesmen to explain them
fully. He said it was 'disconcerting' that so many fact-finds - the forms
filled in by salesmen or advisers detailing the financial circumstances of a
client - were not completed fully.
'It suggests that, in the push to produce a sale, important requirements and
needs may be overlooked and an unsuitable product selected by the salesman,'
he added.
A mother and son were sold two life policies and told they would make a
reasonable profit after five years. Since these were whole-of-life plans,
they got a shock when they came to surrender them five years later. The
agent for the company said she had stressed their long-term nature by
drawing a graph for the clients showing their growth over 45 years. But the
line showed an increase in returns from the beginning of the policy.
Finding for the clients, Farrand noted: 'With the aid of a magnifying glass,
one might estimate a return after five years of around 30 per cent.'
In another case a young woman had been sold a large amount of life cover.
The section on the fact-find asking which aspects of insurance were
important to her was left blank.
'When reviewing her complaint,' Farrand said, 'it was difficult to
understand why that amount of life cover had been required. After some
investigation, the probable answer became clear - that over-selling was
involved.'
Sales of inappropriate policies are highlighted by the fact that while the
insurance company's decision was revised in only 31.5 per cent of all cases
investigated by the ombudsman, this proportion rose to 42 per cent when it
came to life insurance. Farrand is, therefore, suggesting a 'reverse
fact-find' which salesmen would have to complete before the contract was
signed. He suggests the customer should ask these questions: Whose agent are
you?
How much commission do you get?
What charges will be made for managing my money?
Will I do better than with the building society?
Could I lose money?
How soon will the surrender value equal the premiums paid?
Why are you advising me to buy that particular policy/investment?
Allied Dunbar claimed this week that asking a salesman to disclose how much
commission he got - a cost which is, ultimately, borne by the customer - was
'irrelevant information. It is useless.' The Office of Fair Trading has,
however, called repeatedly for commission disclosure at a time when the
whole financial services industry is under pressure to introduce higher
standards of investor protection.
The Prudential said it favoured customers being told the overall expense of
the contract and not just the commission. 'An insurance salesman could be on
full salary or just commission or a combination of the two,' said the Pru.
'So, a customer who simply asks the rate of commission might be misled by
the answer.'
Another area which preoccupied the ombudsman was home income plans. In the
1980s, many elderly people wanting to take income out of their home were
persuaded to take out a mortgage and invest the money in an equity-linked
bond.
This was supposed to cover the mortgage payments and give them an income.
But poor stock market performance and rising interest rates meant higher
mortgage payments and investment losses, pushing many into debt.
In cases where the risks of the investment were not explained properly,
Farrand said he would find in favour of the customer. The guidelines he uses
for compensation are much better than those employed by the Investors
Compensation Scheme, from which home income victims have to claim if the
company or independent financial adviser selling them the policy is no
longer in business.
Last week, the High Court ruled that the ICS was not acting 'irrationally'
in refusing to award compensation for distress over home income plans, or
for money spent by a victim in the belief that this was profit, not capital.
By contrast, Farrand said he expected victims to be returned to the same
financial position they had been in before the scheme.
He is also prepared to make awards for distress: one couple was given Pounds
3,000 after one of them had a heart attack. In some cases, he will also
oblige the insurance company to pay the victim for the costs of taking
professional advice. Pressure is, therefore, expected to increase for
compensation arrangements for home income plan victims to be equalised
within the industry.
The ombudsman awarded a total of Pounds 4.5m last year, with the highest
amount being Pounds 120,000 in a case about building insurance. He said he
was disappointed that the industry 'suffers from some people's apparent
inability to recognise that a fraud against it is a fraud against the
premium-paying population at large.'
Of the general insurance cases, one involved a claim where the insurer
refused to cover accidental damage for a Nintendo Gameboy, saying it was not
a computer as specified under the policy. But, after Farrand consulted the
Oxford dictionary, the company agreed to pay out.

ONE OF the outstanding share performers of the past two years has been
Electronic Data Processing. Like some of the other stars of the industry, it
showed a big increase in its price even when the market was in the doldrums.
From the start of 1991, EDP's share price raced ahead, from 70p to around
535p now. Chief executive Richard Jowitt has sold 19,160 shares and
fellow-director Philip Smith 15,000 - both at 500p.
Over the past three months, shares in Leslie Wise, the textile company, have
outperformed the market by 15 per cent in the run-up to final results,
announced last week. Profits fell marginally but earnings were maintained.
Stuart Leiton sold 300,000 shares at 68p on the same day results were
announced.
Haynes Publishing, known best for books and manuals on cars, barely broke
even in 1991 but analysts expect pre-tax profits of Pounds 3m-plus for the
year to end-May. Chief executive Steven Pearce has sold his entire holding,
of 10,989 shares, at 332p.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Pep firm folds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CLOSURE 10 days ago of a Winchester-based unit trust manager, Wessex
Asset Management - known best as the inventor of the Pep mortgage: a simple
but highly cost-efficient product - highlights both the good and not so good
aspects of the regulatory system for financial services.
IMRO, the companies' regulator, detected financial strains within WAM in
December. With the co-operation of its management, IMRO and other regulators
moved to secure investors' funds before WAM's troubles could come to a head.
These assets - some Pounds 500,000 held in a single unit trust called the
Wessex UK Growth trust - are safe in the hands of WAM's trustee, the Royal
Bank of Scotland, and a new manager - possibly Cannon Fund Managers - is
expected to be appointed soon. Despite all this, the affair still has
serious negative implications for investor protection.
Terry Moran, WAM's managing director, blames the company's commercial demise
on the system's failure to inform the public of the true cost of competing
products and, in particular, its apparent inability to make prospective
investors aware of the influence commission payments have on advisers.
He said: 'It is a fact of life that what is in the best interests of the
consumer is not always in the best interests of the salesman. Once people
are finally made aware of the commission and charges endowments attract,
then Peps will take off.' He added: 'It's sad, but we (WAM) were five to 10
years too early.'
Despite receiving hefty front-end commissions, advisers maintain that
traditional endowments are safer than unit trust-based Peps because bonuses
cannot be taken back once declared and policy-holders do not, therefore, run
the risk of a stock market crash wiping out their savings.
But the number of traditional endowment policies sold is declining and, even
where they are recommended, more than 50 per cent of the total estimated
return is likely to be paid in a final 'terminal' bonus which is not
guaranteed and is equally vulnerable to market adjustment.
For further information about WAM, contact Graham Williams at IMRO (tel.
071-628 6022) or John Crichton, Royal Bank of Scotland (071-615 2871).

CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester and Nationwide building societies are cutting
investment rates from Monday. They are also offering mortgage rates of 4 per
cent. At C&amp;G, cuts are between 0.8 and 0.61 of a percentage point on gross
rates. The flat rate on the London Share account is dropping from 7 per cent
gross to 6.25; the London Deposit account's top tier of Pounds 25,000 and
over will pay 7.2 instead of 8. The Flexi-Tessa rate is 6.85, down from 7.5,
but the new Best 90 account is unaffected. It is paying 7.55 on the bottom
tier of Pounds 10,000 and up to 8.55 on balances of Pounds 100,000.
Nationwide's top tier of CashBuilder (Pounds 25,000 and above) will pay 5.6
per cent gross instead of 6.2. Rates on CapitalBuilder are now 6.3 on the
top tier of Pounds 50,000 and above. There are also interest rate and
overdraft reductions on Flexaccount, the interest-bearing current account.
*****
FIRST-time buyers at C&amp;G are being offered a mortgage of 4 per cent fixed
(8.1 apr) until February 28 next year. The mortgage then reverts to C&amp;G's
standard variable rate, now 7.99. It is available on interest-only and
repayment mortgages for a minimum deposit of 10 per cent.
The maximum loan is Pounds 70,000 and application fee is Pounds 50. If you
redeem in the first three years, the mortgage will be treated as though you
had taken out the loan at the standard rate.
Nationwide is selling off up to 1,500 of its repossessed properties for a
similarly reduced rate. Buyers will be offered a fixed rate of 4.25 per cent
for two years (7.8 apr) and a free valuation. You have to put down a 10 per
cent deposit and take out the society's payment cover policy for the
fixed-rate period. The arrangement fee is Pounds 50. There are no early
redemption penalties.
*****
SCOTTISH Amicable reduced payouts on 10-year with-profits policies by more
than 15 per cent this week, from Pounds 7,331 to Pounds 6,174 (based on a
male, aged 29 at outset, paying Pounds 30 per month in premiums). Roy
Nicholson, managing director, said cuts were caused by the group's
investment focus on small company shares, which had suffered in the
recession. However, this factor had little effect on longer-term policies;
accordingly, 25-year policies are being reduced by just 4.7 per cent, from
Pounds 62,543 to Pounds 59,602. The payouts represent annual returns of 10.4
per cent for the 10-year policies and 13 per cent for 25 years.
*****
It was another good week for small company shares. The County Small
Companies Index rose 0.3 per cent from 1051.95 to 1055.57 in the week to
February 25 while the Hoare Govett index (capital gains version) increased
0.2 per cent from 1346.28 to 1349.05 over the same period.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: We'll be worse off with the Budget -
Well, that's what one accountant thinks. Others differ
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE first of two Budgets this year just over two weeks away, some of
the large accountancy firms are predicting measures which the chancellor of
the exchequer, Norman Lamont, might announce on March 16. In most cases,
there will be few precautionary measures individuals can take even if the
forecasts turn out to be right. If value-added tax were to be introduced on
books and children's clothes, for instance, stocking up on these in advance
has its limits.
Other measures may have more practical consequences. One prediction is that
tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas) may be abolished - an
incentive, if ever there was one, to get every member of the family to open
one, even with only a small deposit.
'Most of us will be worse off than before,' says Peter Wyman, tax partner at
Coopers &amp; Lybrand. 'The question is, by how much and in which areas.' But
since Lamont has a difficult task to bolster confidence and stimulate the
economy while funding a deficit, there are many who expect the first Budget
to be cautious and the second to contain more radical measures. So, what may
we expect?
Personal taxes. Both Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Young believe Lamont will
extend the 20 per cent income tax band, which he introduced in the last
Budget, on the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. E&amp;Y suggests it could
replace the 25 per cent basic-rate tax band through its extension to the
first Pounds 10,000 of taxable income. To maintain tax revenue, E&amp;Y thinks
Lamont could convert the remainder of the 25 per cent band to 30 per cent
and alter the 40 per cent threshold.
For Coopers &amp; Lybrand and KPMG Peat Marwick, however, the most likely
outcome is that, like last year, the thresholds will not be increased in
line with inflation. By making no change, the Treasury would get an extra
Pounds 1bn in revenue.
Other personal taxes. Coopers believes that inheritance tax and capital
gains tax will both be increased with inflation and that there is a chance
the threshold on IHT could be raised to as much as Pounds 175,000. KPMG says
there are rumours that CGT might be rebased to 1992 which would, in some
cases, have the effect of delaying accrued losses.
Personal allowances. Coopers thinks that Lamont is likely to allow personal
allowances to rise with inflation, but E&amp;Y predicts no indexation for
allowances. Price Waterhouse thinks the married couples' allowance will be
left unchanged at Pounds 1,720.
Value-added tax. Since every percentage point increase in the standard rate
of VAT means the Treasury would raise Pounds 2bn, it is an obvious target
for the chancellor. Although an increase in the standard rate from 17.5 to
18.5 - or even 20 - per cent is possible, E&amp;Y thinks that such an increase
is more likely to come in the second Budget.
Price Waterhouse, Touche Ross and Coopers think that a new, reduced rate of
possibly 5 per cent could be introduced on items hitherto exempt - such as
books, newspapers and children's clothes.
National Insurance contributions. Price Waterhouse says: 'The yield from
this hidden tax, which is charged on both employers and employees, is so
high that the government can be expected to continue its policy of quietly
increasing the amount it raises while deflecting public attention onto
income tax reduction.' PW and E&amp;Y believe the chancellor could decide
further moves to integrate NIC with income tax, while E&amp;Y thinks employers'
NIC could be extended to taxable benefits. Touche Ross wonders if Lamont
will be tempted to remove the earnings cap for the self-employed, who enjoy
more generous treatment than others for NIC purposes.
Savings and personal investment. Touche Ross does not expect major changes
to personal equity plans and Tessas but E&amp;Y thinks the latter could be axed.
PW thinks Lamont could allow the inclusion of gilts in Peps to encourage
people to buy more of them. While there is no CGT on gilts, they are liable
to income tax - but anything in a Pep is exempt from either taxes.
The business expansion scheme will be extinguished at the end of December,
but Touche Ross and E&amp;Y think the chancellor could announce an end to 'loan
back' schemes - which allow an exit from the scheme after six months - for
the rest of the year.
Cars. When Lamont abolished car tax last year, he warned that he would take
other measures to recoup the loss. A steep increase in petrol duty is,
therefore, expected by all. KPMG and Touche Ross think new scale rates for
company cars may also be introduced, following the proposal last July by the
Inland Revenue for basing taxation of company car benefits on the cost of
the vehicle rather than engine size.
Other possible areas for action include reforming the taxation of trusts and
introducing an earnings cap for retirement annuity premiums, to bring them
into line with personal pension plans. There is a possibility that the lump
sum payable on maturity could be taxed on new plans. Lamont could also
announce the gradual phasing-out of mortgage interest tax relief, although
the delicate state of the housing market might inhibit him from doing so in
the first Budget.
Finally, the Revenue's new tax return form, which will be sent out in April,
is expected to herald the beginning of 'self-assessment' where individuals
will estimate their own liability - although the Revenue will be able to
challenge the result.

<TEXT>
WILLIAMS Holdings, the industrial conglomerate, is expected to show a 5 per
cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 168m to Pounds 160m, when it
announces full-year results on Thursday. The company's exposure to d-i-y and
aerospace markets are behind the likely slip in earnings per share to 20.1p
(22.8p). The dividend is expected to be maintained.
Another round of write-downs on property and the Channel Tunnel contract is
thought to have kept BICC's pre-tax profit flat at about Pounds 80m last
year. It reports on Wednesday.
Two more composite insurance companies, General Accident and Guardian Royal
Exchange, are expected to report sharply-reduced losses next week. Rising
premium rates and milder weather are mainly responsible for the improvement.
GA is expected to report a loss of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 30m on
Tuesday, compared with a deficit of Pounds 171.6m in 1991. On Wednesday, GRE
could also report losses of between Pounds 20m and Pounds 40m, against
losses of Pounds 209.7m in 1991.
Fisons, the drugs and scientific instrument group, reports its full-year
results on Tuesday. Analysts are unsure about the net impact of disposals
during the past 12 months, which must now be carried above the line to
conform to the new FRS3 accounting standard. Lehman Brothers estimates the
underlying business will report profits down from Pounds 190.5m last year to
about Pounds 105m. This represents a 50 per cent improvement during the
second half of the year.
The 1992 results for Barclays will be announced on Thursday. These will be
preceded on Tuesday by Abbey National, and on Wednesday by Midland. Barclays
is expected to make a pre-tax loss of about Pounds 100m, and a retained loss
of Pounds 500-Pounds 600m after maintaining the final dividend. But BZW is
predicting a cut in the dividend.
Abbey National will make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 570m, and retained
profits of about Pounds 200m. Its provisions for possible bad debts are
expected to double to about Pounds 320m, reflecting the depressed UK housing
market. Midland is expected to show the effect of a significant lightening
of its provisions for possible bad debts to about Pounds 700m for the year,
compared with Pounds 903m in 1991. This is expected to boost pre-tax profits
to about Pounds 200m from Pounds 36m.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Revenue opens itself to more
complaints
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POWERFUL new post to be advertised by the Inland Revenue in the next few
days should be good news for taxpayers with grievances. As part of the
government's Citizen's Charter initiative, an independent 'revenue
adjudicator' should be in post by May to cope with complaints from the
public for periods after the start of the new tax year on April 6.
The Revenue expects that person to receive 20 to 50 complaints each week. He
or she will consider complaints about the way tax affairs have been handled,
but will not be involved in hearing appeals on tax assessments.
Appeals on tax are, ultimately, heard by the general and special
commissioners for tax and by valuation tribunals, before heading into the
courts on appeal.
On the handling of tax affairs, the Revenue says that the first person for
complaints should, ideally, be the district inspector of the local tax or
collection office who is most familiar with the cases and officials
concerned.
It says the vast majority of complaints are handled successfully at this
level. Those who are not satisfied should contact the regional controller,
whose address is available from the local tax office.
After that, many complaints go to the board of the Inland Revenue in London.
Others are sent to members of parliament who can, in turn, refer them to the
parliamentary commissioner for administration or 'ombudsman' - who takes on
a handful of cases each year.
Officials hope the public will make contact with the new adjudicator only
after trying the regional controller of the payer's tax area, but add that
the adjudicator will always be available to process problems or refer them
to the appropriate individual.
They say they dealt with around 14,000 complaints last year. One-fifth were
about technical and procedural matters; one-fifth with delays; and another
18 per cent related to systems, policy issues or questions about why
individuals should have to pay tax at all. Some 5 per cent concerned
investigations.
All the rest concerned topics such as failure to keep the taxpayer informed,
incomplete handling of cases, and failure of liaison. About half of all
complaints relate to pay-as-you-earn.
The Revenue stresses that a national survey of taxpayers it conducted last
year showed that 65 per cent were satisified with the overall service they
received. It says it is taking on board suggestions which resulted,
including improving its educational activities to ensure that people pay the
right amount of tax - neither too little nor too much.
In the past few days, the Revenue has also released three new codes of
practice designed to bring together and make public its existing guidance
for staff.
Mistakes by the Revenue. This points out possible redress against the
organisation when it has made a serious mistake or delay - such as paying
interest on money owed or costs related to delays in processing enquiries.
Inland Revenue investigations. This stresses that even when taxpayers'
affairs are being investigated, they are entitled to the same rights and
courtesies as anyone else and can ask for explanations at any time.
Inspections of employers' and contractors' records. This says the Revenue
will respect confidentiality and give notice of visits to examine records.
A new version of leaflet IR 120 (You and the Inland Revenue), available from
local tax offices, will be printed shortly containing details of the new
arrangements.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: So many Peps - but which is best for
you? - Philip Coggan seeks guidance through a financial maze
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARCH is fast becoming the personal equity plan season. There is nothing
like a deadline to make investors open their wallets, and the approach of
the end of the financial year on April 5 turns their mind to tax-free
products.
Logically, it would have been better for investors to buy Peps in August,
when the FT-SE 100 index was at 2,280, than now, with the market trading in
the 2,800s. But with investors limited to one general Pep a year (see guide
below), there is a natural tendency to wait for the 'best product.' Also,
with base rates at 6 per cent, those savers who previously were content to
leave all their money in the building society may now be considering Peps
for the first time. A stream of these has been launched over the past few
weeks, with the specific aim of attracting investors who want income.
Perhaps the most ingenious is Hypo Foreign &amp; Colonial's Higher Income plan,
which offers a yield of 10 per cent after charges through use of the options
market. The product looks very attractive but is very complex and investors
should take financial advice before parting with their cash.
There is a danger that people will rush into Peps for the wrong reason. Any
equity-based investment involves risk; you should not buy a Pep if you are
likely to panic should your investment fall by 10 per cent six months from
now. These are investments for the long term, which means at least five
years.
You should also watch to see that the charges do not eat up the tax
benefits. This is a particular problem for a basic-rate taxpayer, who might
find it better to buy some unit or investment trusts directly, rather than
in Pep form. It is rarely suitable for a non-taxpayer to buy a Pep.
How does the investor sort through all the Peps on offer to find the one
that best suits his or her needs? One useful source of information is the
Chase de Vere Pepguide, which publishes details of around 700 plans and is
available for Pounds 9.95 from Chase de Vere Investments, 63 Lincoln's Inn
Fields, London WC2A 3JX.
BESt Pep (tel. 071-936 2037) produces a free background guide and makes
recommendations, for a charge of Pounds 25. Like Chase de Vere, it refunds
the charge if an investor then buys a Pep.
To guide readers through the maze, we asked financial advisers to give their
views on the Peps that would best suit three different types of investor.
Basic-rate taxpaying individuals in their 30s who want to save for the long
term.
John Cole, of Berry, Birch &amp; Noble, says a younger person probably will look
for a managed fund, as offered by a unit or investment trust. 'You don't
want to go for a yield as high as 6 or 7 per cent,' he says 'but it would be
wrong to go for a fund with no yield at all.' Cole says a unit trust such as
Perpetual's High Income, or an investment trust such as Murray Income, might
be suitable.
Richard Boyton, of Boyton Financial Services, recommends the Killik
self-select Pep where charges are 1.85 per cent for dealing and a levy of
Pounds 7.50 per dividend. He recommends that investors then select the
Scottish Value investment trust. Says Boyton: 'This fund has outperformed
the FT-SE 100 index by over 50 per cent since September 1991.'
David Harris of Chantrey Vellacott says that young people 'might well use a
Pep to back their mortgage. Peps represent the best long-term vehicle for
this.'
He adds that such people should opt for a cautious capital growth approach,
linked to either a unit or investment trust. 'Statistics show that
individuals in this age group tend not to invest the maximum Pounds 6,000
and to elect for regular monthly savings. I would choose fund managers with
a strong record who figure regularly in the top 25 per cent of performers.
My particular selections would be the Schroder Pep linked to its UK equity
fund, or Foreign &amp; Colonial's Pep investment trust.'
Mark Bolland of Chamberlain de Broe also favours Peps for mortgage
repayments. 'They are tax-efficient, and cheaper and far more versatile and
flexible than an endowment. The only thing they lack is an insurance
element, and that can be arranged more efficiently by other methods.
'Ideal vehicles are the investment trust savings schemes. These are
comparatively cheap and the returns can be outstanding. Someone kicking off
with a reasonably small amount could invest in the old favourites, Foreign &amp;
Colonial and Alliance. A couple could put up to Pounds 250 per month into
these trusts, which have very attractive long-term returns and are broadly
invested internationally.'
'Those in a position to save more, could look to other regular savings
schemes in the UK/EC trusts such as TR City of London, Guinness Flight's
Temple Bar trust, or Kleinwort Benson's Merchants Trust.'
Top-rate taxpayers in their 50s who are aiming to save for their retirement.
Harris favours a slightly more aggressive stance for people in this
category, who may want to consider a self-select Pep. 'My choice would rest
between the Charles Stanley gold Pep, for execution-only deals, and the
Alliance Trust Pep, although this requires the first Pounds 1,500 to be
invested in Alliance investment trusts and has a restricted list of direct
shares.
'For more conventional investors, I would choose the Perpetual self-select
Pep linked to their UK growth fund or, for international exposure, Barings'
Maxi-Continental plan linked to their European Growth trust.'
Cole says such investors might view their Pep as an extension of their
general equity portfolio and will probably opt for a self-select plan.
Bolland says: 'The nature of the investment needs to be considered
carefully, given that a tighter time scale is involved. If there is only
five years until retirement, too much risk is unwise.
'Suitable vehicles would be the Cazenove and Newton income Peps. The former
is a low-cost plan investing specifically in utilities and bonds, offering a
high yield. If anything, the drawback with this approach is limiting
exposure to a narrow range of equities. I like the Newton fund because of
its excellent long term record for growth and income.'
Boyton again opts for the Killik self-select Pep but linked to Morgan
Grenfell's Equity Income fund, yielding 5.4 per cent gross. This would give
a tax-free income of Pounds 324, which equates to a gross yield of 9 per
cent before tax.
Retired basic-rate taxpayers who need income.
A good yield is obviously the key factor, says Cole. He thinks the choice
falls between two plans: Cazenove's Bond and Utility fund; and the Fidelity
High Income, which yields 6 per cent and has slightly higher charges but
pays a monthly income. 'Many small investors are very keen on the monthly
option,' he adds.
Harris says: 'For the investor ready to take a moderate level of risk, I
would choose a unit trust-based income portfolio which yields between 15-25
per cent more than the All-Share. A good example is Newton Income.
'For those willing to take a slightly higher level of risk, investment trust
Peps using income shares will provide a higher yield. However, it should be
remembered that other classes of shares within the trust have first call on
any capital growth and there is a real chance of capital loss. My favourite
in this area is the Murray Johnstone Pep, linked to its split-capital trust
income shares. Alternatively, the new Cazenove Bond &amp; Utility fund is highly
attractive.'
Bolland says: 'Rather than going flat out for income, long-term capital and
dividend growth should be the targets. A self-select Pep investing in income
shares might be appropriate. Care is needed in choosing the income shares,
since some involve the possibility of a loss to redemption; the shares
selected should be ones which can participate in the capital growth of the
trust. A lower risk option might be the Cazenove plan.'
For those needing income, Boyton unashamedly recommends a product his own
firm has put together, with Killik as plan manager and Olliff &amp; Partners
making the share selection. The scheme is a combination of a split-level
income investment trust share and a zero dividend preference share.
The anticipated net yield in year one, after charges, is 9.46 per cent. This
will rise to 10.52 per cent in year five provided the income section grows
by 2.5 per cent per annum. A Pounds 10,000 investment is needed, of which
Pounds 6,000 is invested in a Pep and the balance in zeros. Charges are the
normal ones for Killik (see above), 1 per cent initial for Olliff, and
Pounds 150 payable to Boyton.
THE JARGON EXPLAINED
A PERSONAL equity plan allows an investor to buy stock market investments on
which all income and capital gains are tax-free. Individuals are limited to
a maximum of Pounds 6,000 a in most Peps during a tax year (although a
single-company plan of Pounds 3,000 can be bought on top).
The majority of the investment must be in shares (although a unit trust
which invests in both shares and gilts, can be eligible). Cash can be held
within the plan, but only if it is intended to move the money into shares
eventually. More than 50 per cent of the assets must be in the European
Community. There is no time limit on Pep investment but the nature of the
scheme makes it a long-term prospect. The capital gains tax exemption is of
value only to the wealthy - fewer than 100,000 people are likely to pay CGT
this year - and the income tax exemption is worth a very small amount in
early years. If a Pep has a yield of 5 per cent, the annual income on a
Pounds 6,000 plan will be Pounds 300; that represents a saving of Pounds 75
for basic-rate taxpayers and Pounds 120 for those on the top rate. Pep
charges can often obliterate these gains.
There are many types of Pep available. For those confused by the jargon,
they fall into these categories:
Corporate. This is a plan devoted to buying shares in a single company.
Confused easily with a single-company Pep (see below), a corporate Pep
allows for a full Pounds 6,000 investment. Many companies have set up
low-cost plans to benefit existing investors; but they must sell their
shares and buy them back within the Pep. The costs of this might outweigh
the benefits.
Investment trust. A plan which invests solely in the shares of one
investment trust, or a small group of them. Since trust charges normally are
quite low, most IT Peps will have additional charges. For some investors,
particularly basic-rate payers, these extra levies could outweigh the
benefits of holding the plan in Pep form.
Managed. A manager (normally a stockbroker, financial adviser or fund
management group) selects shares, or a combination of shares, unit and
investment trusts. Charges tend to be higher on these plans and performance
figures are difficult to come by.
Self-select. A plan where the investor chooses the stocks. A manager still
has to do the paperwork, however, and the investor must pay a charge;
indeed, the most crucial component in a self-select PEP is the charges. But
some brokers will offer advice on the stocks you select; it might be worth
paying a higher charge to benefit from this advice.
Single-company. An additional plan which can be added to other types of Pep.
Single-company plans are limited to Pounds 3,000 a year and, because of the
risk of 'putting all your eggs in one basket,' they are suited best to those
with large equity portfolios. But they can also be useful for those who have
bought shares through company option schemes. Such shares can be transferred
into a Pep without any liability for CGT if the transfer is within 90 days
of their purchase via the scheme.
Unit trust. A plan where the money is invested in a single unit trust. In
many cases, there are no additional charges; so if you are prepared to buy
into a unit trust in any case, you might as well do so via a Pep. But if
there are additional charges, you need to make a careful comparison to see
if these fees outweigh the tax benefits.

fund management groups can be found in the managed funds pages at the back

FT  27 FEB 93 / Markets still playing it cool with Clinton: Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WHOLE may usually be greater than the sum of the parts. But
occasionally, the parts still steal the limelight.
That was the case on Wall Street this week. Having spent much of the
previous week focusing on the grand economic strategy and the implications
which the Clinton plan may have for the speed at which the US pulls out of
recession, the market switched its attention to the slightly more
predictable effect on individual industries. For the likes of biotechnology,
tobacco and luxury consumer goods stocks, this was not a happy scrutiny.
Admittedly, the macro-picture was not forgotten altogether. On Tuesday,
publication of the monthly Conference Board report on levels of consumer
confidence sent stock prices tumbling across a number of sectors.
The Conference Board calculated its index for February at 68.5, more than
eight points lower than the level registered in January. To compound the
gloom, its survey had been conducted two weeks before the Clinton package
was announced to Congress. Even at this stage, it seemed, consumers were
becoming increasingly wary about the recovery's strength.
The stock market, seeing some of its worst fears confirmed, took the news
fairly badly. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by almost 20 points,
although the broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index showed a much smaller
loss. Even in this instance, however, the declines were concentrated among
mainline 'consumer stocks'. The three carmakers, for example, shed 4 to 6
per cent of their value, while many of the nation's largest retailers also
posted significant declines.
Thereafter, the remainder of the week's trading was erratic. Faced with a
paucity of 'hard news' or fresh economic data, dealers and investors turned
to a wave of rumours, and to 'micro' considerations of individual stocks or
sectors, in an effort to stimulate business.
No rumour proved more powerful than the whisper that President Clinton was
about to cap credit card interest rates and, according to some sources,
finance charges on other forms of consumer credit. The suggestion duly
provoked a denial from the Treasury - but not before some credit cards
stocks had lost, and then regained, about one-fifth of their market value.
Tobacco stocks fell prey to the same type of treatment. Fears that the
Clinton administration would tax tobacco more heavily in an effort to fund a
health-care reform plan hung over the sector for most of the week. Philip
Morris, for example, which had dived on the previous Friday, continued to
slide early in the week. The stock then railled mid-week, before edging down
again as the week's trading drew to a close. By Friday lunchtime, Philip
Morris shares were trading at Dollars 66, only  1/2 away from its 52-week
low.
The story within some other sectors was a little more rational. For some
time, drug companies have seen the new President's attacks on their pricing
policies translate into substantial share price falls. This week, however,
attention focused more heavily on the biotechnolgy stocks. Compounding the
general uncertainty over health care reform implications, a couple of
biotech companies released pessimistic announcements - thus accelarating the
sector's general decline.
Amgen, for example, warned that first quarter sales and profits would be
significantly below Wall Street's expectations; Synergen revealed that a
drug, designed to treat septic shock, had not performed up to expectations
in clinical trials. The former's shares fell over Dollars 9, to around
Dollars 37 on the news; the latter lost Dollars 28 5/8 , to Dollars 13 1/2 .
Some investors may wonder when this speculation-driven trading will be
replaced by a more solid trend. Few traders think that this is likely in the
foreseeble future. The full implications of the Clinton package - in
particular, the details of health care reform - will take months to unfold.
Even then there are numerous political hurdles to surmount.
Nevertheless, despite all the plunges and rallies, the Dow Jones Industrial
Average has moved by a net 30-odd points since President Clinton first
appeared on the nation's television screens explaining the broad outlines of
his deficit reduction plan - scarcely the most momentous of movements.
Meanwhile, the rate at which the economy was recovering at the end of 1992
remains debatable; on Friday, for example, the authorities released a
revised estimate for fourth quarter economic growth suggesting that gross
domestic product was growing at an annualised rate of 4.8 per cent, up from
a previous estimate of 3.8 per cent.
In short, uncertain about both the recent past and the immediate future,
Wall Street is taking the obvious course. It is simply waiting to see.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Markets: Equities are bowled over by Gooch - London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS one explanation for the behaviour of the equity market this week -
it has been tracking the performance of the England cricket team touring
India.
After a downcast start - when England, already two down in the series lost
the third and final test - shares ended the week in much brighter mood. A
48-run-win in the final one-day international prompted a 39.3 point rise in
the Footsie index yesterday, which ended the week at 2868.0, a gain of 28
points.
Perhaps the much criticised England selectors have been guilty of the
short-termism charge often aimed at fund managers - picking one day winners,
rather than a side with staying power.
The real reason for the market's performance, though, is that investors have
spent the week focusing on the ICI announcement which was made on Thursday.
Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were occupied with fears that ICI would cut
its dividend or launch an immediate rights issue, or both. Thursday brought
relief on both counts, and the market began to rise. The rally gathered pace
yesterday.
Thursday's 11.7 point rise owed much to a 70 1/2 p jump in ICI's share
price. But yesterday's increase, with ICI up another 55 1/2 p to 1208p,
suggested buying interest was more widespread.
Another feature of the market this week was that the Footsie did better than
the 250 index. The second tier index includes a large chunk of recovery
stocks and has greatly outperformed the Footsie since Black Wednesday last
September - a day which Sir Denys Henderson, ICI's chairman, persists in
calling Sunny Wednesday.
A better performance by the front line stocks suggests that UK investors are
turning away from recovery stocks to more mainline shares and also that
overseas investors are beginning to buy the UK equity market.
The big deterrent for foreign investors of late has been sterling's collapse
since Sunny Wednesday. While the pound was in free fall, no non-sterling
based investor would look at the UK market. But there is now the beginning
of a belief that sterling - which hit another record low against the D-Mark
this week - is near its bottom.
If foreign investors can be confident that the pound will at least stabilise
at these levels, they can start looking at yields on UK equities which are
attractive compared to other equity markets, and in some cases compared to
cash and bonds.
ICI, to pick a stock at random, yields 6 per cent with the promise of a
maintained dividend in the current year too.
There is another group of investors which had been wary of buying shares but
have changed their view. UK private investors are back in the market, as
evidenced by unit trust sales which topped Pounds 500m net of repurchases in
January.
Ignoring the cynics who believe that unit trust investors always buy at the
top, this could be another good sign for the market. Individuals have seen
the rates they get on savings accounts shrink as base rates fall. When they
can get a higher income from shares, and the chance of capital gain, they
are not slow in shifting their cash.
It may be clutching at straws, but a new-found interest from foreign and
private investors could form the basis of another run in the equity market.
While institutional investors are unlikely to sell shares, when re-investing
the cash would give a poorer return, the squeeze on their liquidity was
putting a damper on the market.
The fears of a rights issue from ICI - which will be coming in June from the
demerged Zeneca - and other rumoured cash callers has been a depressant for
the market.
Although shares of those companies which have staged issues have generally
done well, and the take up of issues such as Burton's and Asda's has been
high, the demand for new equity allied with the government's desperate need
for cash to plug the gaping budget deficit has been weighing on investors'
minds.
At least some companies are trying more imaginative ways to raise money, and
ones which could put less of a burden on the UK institutional investors. A
series of bond issues, convertibles and fixed rate, have been launched.
This week's crop included a convertible from BPB, the plasterboard group,
which was accompanied by a forecast of a dividend cut on the ordinary
shares, and a Pounds 100m bond from Royal Insurance, which also announced
lower losses.
A couple of large, cash takeover bids would do even more for share prices,
but that may be too much to hope for.
Perhaps surprisingly, the market seems less concerned about the economy than
for some time.
Fourth quarter gross domestic product figures on Monday, revealing a tenth
quarter of recession, were shrugged off. Discussion about what the budget
might bring has yet to become intense. There is just the assumption that
base rates will be cut again. Even the latest job losses stories have had
little effect on a market which knows that unemployment continues to rise
long after a recession turns to recovery.
The beginning of the company results season has so far brought few nasty
surprises. Even apparently huge pre-tax losses, such as British Aerospace's
Pounds 1.2bn and ICI's Pounds 384m, are being ignored. The excuse is that
the introduction of new accounting rules, which make companies take all
one-off losses and profits into the pre-tax figure, means that the losses
are not 'real'.
Equally Shell appears to have largely got away with making a Pounds 131m
provision against foreign exchange losses, putting the blame firmly on the
Japanese associate where the currency speculation took place. Top managers
there did the decent thing.
Indeed, there has been some good corporate news this week. It must be
encouraging that Unilever could increase pre-tax profits 13 per cent to
Pounds 2bn in spite of the recession, and that SmithKline Beecham could
raise profits 11 per cent to Pounds 1.1bn.
Encouraging may not be the word to apply to Amstrad's sudden return to
profits. Shareholders in that company must have been more than a little
surprised to see a profit and an interim dividend from the consumer
electronics group.
Only last December Amstrad's chairman and chief executive Alan Sugar was
telling them that the outlook was so bleak they should accept his 30p a
share offer. Shareholders are having to pay the Pounds 1.1m cost of
defending the company from its own chairman. The shares finished the week at
27 1/2 p, up 3p.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Markets: The taxman, the free gift and the BES - Serious
Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IS THE government going to crack down on the business expansion scheme? As
the deadline for abolition at end-1993 grows closer, the industry is getting
ever more ingenious in its ways of exploiting the tax shelter, and could be
taxing the Inland Revenue's patience.
This week, there was news of a battle between the Revenue and Johnson Fry
over tax relief on two schemes, Election Protection and part of the Oxbridge
Colleges Cash-Backed plan. The dispute is over an investment in a hall of
residence at University College, London.
All BES properties must be let only on assured tenancies. But because the
university let the property to foreign students during the summer vacation
(after Johnson Fry and UCL had exchanged contracts, but before Johnson Fry
paid for the property), the Revenue is claiming the scheme broke the BES
rules. It should not, therefore, attract tax relief.
This could be dreadful news for investors in the schemes, since they make
little sense as investments per se; the return depends almost entirely on
the tax relief. Johnson Fry and its lawyers contend, however, that these
schemes should attract tax relief; and it emphasises that those who invested
in the non-UCL part of the Oxbridge fund (such as the Balliol college
scheme) are not affected.
The dispute caused one BES issue, from Capital Ventures, to be withdrawn
this week and might have raised fears of a general assault by the Revenue on
the industry. Given the structure of many recent schemes, with top-rate
taxpayers earning 20 per cent plus profits in six months, it would not be
surprising if the taxman were to be itching for revenge.
For the moment, however, it seems clear that the dispute is limited to
university-backed schemes and, even there, will affect only those using
existing halls of residence.
The bank and building society schemes continue to flourish, such as the
Gracechurch issue launched by the London-based Barclays de Zoete Wedd.
Backed by Barclays bank, it offers a non-recourse loan enabling higher-rate
taxpayers to get back 74p after six months, equivalent to an annualised
return of 30 per cent. This facility is not suitable for basic-rate
taxpayers. Prospectuses are available from a limited number of Barclays
branches, or from BZW.
Such schemes are, effectively, gifts from the broad mass of taxpayers to
top-rate payers and lenders with repossessed properties on their hands. The
chancellor seems willing to allow this, for want of a better way of soaking
up the burden of repossessed properties. Those who can take advantage of the
plan will rub their hands in anticipation of profits; those who do not will
grind their teeth if other taxes go up in the Budget.
*****
ROBIN Angus, of NatWest Securities Ltd, is a sort of Old Testament prophet
of the investment trust industry. A fierce traditionalist, he is deeply
suspicious of some of the new-fangled split capital structures devised by
investment trust companies to attract the private investor.
In his latest Yearly Review of the sector, he emphasises one vital point for
private investors - that they should consider not just income, or capital,
but total return.
The present fad is to invest in high-yield investments which do not grow
(such as income shares), or in growth instruments which pay no income (such
as capital or zero shares). But a conventional trust can offer both; the
yield might be low but, if the trust rises in price, the investor can sell
some shares and use the proceeds as income.
Say you are a top-rate taxpayer with Pounds 100,000 in income shares which
yield 8 per cent; your annual income would be Pounds 8,000 gross, or Pounds
4,800 net. But if you owned a conventional trust, you might enjoy a 3 per
cent dividend yield and 5 per cent capital growth.
The dividend on the conventional trust would pay only Pounds 3,000 gross, or
Pounds 1,800 net. But if you sold Pounds 5,000 of shares, you might pay no
tax at all on the proceeds if you have no other capital gains that year. As
Angus puts it: 'The Pounds 5,800 capital gains tax exemption is the greatest
undiscovered tax break available to the small or medium-sized investor -
much more powerful than a Pep.'
Even allowing for dealing costs of 5 per cent, the investor in the
conventional trust would still have a net return of Pounds 6,550, far higher
than the income share investor.
Furthermore, Angus argues that the conventional trust could well produce a
better performance in the long run than a split trust, which might have to
tailor its holdings to suit the demands of its different classes of
shareholders. 'Conventionally-structured trusts are investment-driven, while
split-capital trusts are structure-driven,' he says.
Angus's views are a timely reminder for investors that they should not
ignore conventional trusts. Indeed, the volatility of split shares yesterday
prompted Sphere to reveal proposals for a packaged unit; in other words,
creating an instrument which behaves like a share in a conventional trust.
That could prove a straw in the wind . . .

FT  27 FEB 93 / Markets: ICI forges ahead with a split personality - Paul
Abrahams assesses the implications for the small investor after the UK's
biggest demerger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO IMPERIAL Chemical Industry's board pushed the green button. On Wednesday
afternoon, at an historic meeting, it decided to split the UK's biggest
manufacturer into two parts. The following day, the group's executives
announced the decision. They also revealed an horrendous Pounds 384m pre-tax
loss on Pounds 12bn of turnover, and a Pounds 949m provision for
restructuring.
The demerger plan, to be confirmed at an extraordinary general meeting in
May, is to create a fully-independent quoted company called Zeneca. This
will comprise ICI's drugs division, its agrochemicals and seeds operations,
and most of its speciality chemicals businesses. Zeneca's demerger will be
followed by a Pounds 1.3bn rights issue to reduce ICI's debts.
Investors in ICI will be given one Zeneca share for every existing ICI share
they own. They will retain their existing holding unchanged, though they
will then be given the option of buying additional shares in the rights
issue.
On the day of the announcement, ICI's shares rose 70 1/2 p to Pounds 11.52
1/2 . Yesterday they rose another 55p. That does not mean the market
necessarily thinks that the demerger is a good idea. Institutions have been
off-loading the stock for weeks, fearing an immediate Pounds 1bn rights
issue on Thursday.
The ICI board has decided to maintain the dividend at 55p, in spite of bleak
trading prospects, so institutions have been picking up stock in preparation
for the dividend on March 15.
What happens to the share price once the stock goes ex-dividend should prove
interesting. Some private investors may want to forsake the dividend, sell
the stock, benefit from the sharp rise in the share price and avoid the
dangers and complications of the demerger and rights issue.
But what of the prospects for those investors who decide to stick with the
separated groups? Will the split be as successful as those of BAT or
Courtaulds?
ICI, according to Alasdair Nisbet, of UBS, faces a black hole - that of the
continental economy, which is rapidly decelerating. That will have a
knock-on effect on the chemicals groups. Cefic, the European chemicals
association, estimates that growth in west European chemical demand will
slow in all product sectors this year apart from fertilisers.
In 1991, about 25 per cent of new-ICI's turnover was on the continent, with
a further 25 per cent in the UK. Only 19 per cent was in the fast-growing
Asia-Pacific region and 28 per cent in the US, where the economy appears to
be recovering slowly. Ronnie Hampel, new-ICI's chief executive, said the
company would get no help from the world economy over the next 12 months.
Nevertheless, a happy combination of cost cutting and currency benefits
could enable ICI to leap gracefully over the black hole.
Hampel plans a rigorous cost-cutting campaign. The company is proposing yet
another restructuring and a further round of job losses - 7,000 staff will
leave the group over the next three years. Charles Lambert of broker Smith
New Court believes that the job losses alone could eventually save about
Pounds 210m a year.
In addition, this year's figures will be helped by the devaluation of
sterling on what Sir Denys Henderson, the chairman, calls 'sunny Wednesday'.
On a rule of thumb, every cent the US dollar falls adds between Pounds 2m
and Pounds 3m to ICI's pre-tax results. Lambert estimates that currency
benefits - at about Pounds 150m - will form the largest element in ICI's
earnings improvement this year.
The danger is that ICI might leap - and then tumble into the hole. If it
does, the group's promise to maintain the dividend at 27 1/2 p during 1993
looks hard to keep. Much of the share price rise at the end of this week was
based on the promise to maintain the dividend. If ICI looks as if it will
break that promise its shares could be in trouble.
An economic recovery has already been discounted into ICI's share price,
although recovery is far from certain. Nisbet at UBS says that if the market
has underestimated the benefits of currency and the recovery, then investors
might prefer to pick up second tier chemicals stocks rather than buying more
ICI.
The UK, following the devaluation, is the best place in Europe to
manufacture chemicals at the moment, according to Nisbet.
On the other hand, one final reason for buying ICI might be to pick it up as
a takeover play. US broking houses in London have been making noises about a
hostile takeover aimed at breaking up the business.
However, new-ICI will have Pounds 600m of debt after the demerger. Some
analysts believe the board left it there as a poisoned pill to prevent such
a takeover.
Zeneca poses a problem for investors. Drugs stocks are out of favour at the
moment. Institutions have piled out of defensive stocks such as
pharmaceuticals and invested in cyclical companies instead.
Even if the recovery is some way off, institutions are unlikely to move back
into drugs stocks for fear of missing out on the recovery when - and if - it
comes.
An added disincentive for pharmaceuticals stocks is pricing pressure,
particularly in the US. President Clinton will not reveal his health care
reforms - which could affect the drugs groups - until May, almost the same
time as Zeneca's rights issue.
As for Zeneca, the company is not even a pure drugs stock, given that more
than 60 per cent of its sales concern agrochemicals and specialities. It
will have to be valued at a discount to groups such as Glaxo and Wellcome.
Should investors take up their rights? The answer depends on Zeneca's price
and the discount being offered by the company and underwriters.
Zeneca's operating profits actually dropped from Pounds 682m in 1991 to
Pounds 587m last year. Most of the decline was due to the expiry of the US
patents for Tenormin, Zeneca's top drug and once the world's fifth
best-selling medicine, generating sales of nearly Dollars 1.2bn a year.
American sales fell up to 50 per cent last year.
David Barnes, Zeneca's chief executive, believes US sales of Tenormin will
stabilise soon at about 25 of its peak. Meanwhile, revenues from newer
products are increasing rapidly.
Sales of Zestril, a heart drug, improved 30 per cent, while Diprivan, an
anaesthetic, and Zoladex, a cancer treatment, both rose by 50 per cent.
There may also be some recovery potential from the specialities businesses,
especially dyes, which represent about 30 per cent of the division's Pounds
936m turnover. These have been suffering from the recession in the textiles
industry.
Zeneca's 27 1/2 p dividend offers a yield of about 5 per cent - far higher
than traditional drugs stocks. Given that its earnings can only move up, if
the company is offered at the right price, Zeneca could prove an
unfashionable, but valuable, stock to acquire.

FT  27 FEB 93 / When honesty means sharing your bribes: Corruption
investigations are threatening to unravel the Italian state. A former
official tells how the system worked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CORRUPTION in Italy has gone beyond the bounds of decency. So vast is the
scale of rottenness now being uncovered that a whole ruling class risks
being indicted. Already, the courts are being overloaded with the weight of
investigation and the prosecutions have scarcely begun. For the first time,
a democracy is having to confront the uncomfortable question: if the system
is corrupt, to what extent should individual guilt be pursued?
Roberto Mongini has had time to reflect on the question. This 46-year-old
Milanese lawyer, and one-time rising star in the Christian Democrat Party,
was arrested last June and spent 17 days inside the bleak walls of Milan's
San Vittorio prison. He was released after confessing to exploiting his
position as vice-president of the Milan Airports Authority to collect
illicit funds for the party, and went immediately on a pilgrimage to Lourdes
to come to terms with his fall from grace.
Mongini claims to be at peace with himself now although he has lost his seat
on the party's national executive and his political career is over. With the
compulsiveness of a convert to honest government, he admits collecting
nearly L900m (Pounds 410,000) in bribes - a sum he considers small by the
standards of what was going around him. 'I willingly accepted to be part of
the system and therefore cannot regard myself as a victim,' he says. 'At a
personal level, I don't consider myself a criminal. Indeed, I consider
myself personally honest; nevertheless, I admit I formed part of a dishonest
system.'
This ambivalent moral credo seems to have been shared by a great many others
who either turned a blind eye to corruption or connived in creaming
'commissions' off the top of every type of economic activity. The
magistrates' investigations range from road-building and ports to the Milan
and Rome metros and the space agency, football stadiums and overseas aid to
restructuring the chemicals industry. No European democracy has ever
witnessed corruption investigated on such an all-embracing scale. Questions
are being asked about the ability of the courts to cope
'We are not confronted with isolated instances of corruption: the entire
system was like that, from Milan to Sicily,' says Mongini. 'Wherever you
look, you will find illicit financing, it was the Italian way of doing
things.'
Antonio Di Pietro, the leading Milan investigative magistrate, says of the
snowballing investigation: 'I don't see how it can finish. In just one day,
14 or 15 persons came wanting to confess stories of bribery to me. We can't
go on like this.' He adds: 'We will proceed with the penal side . . . but
some sort of political clarification is necessary which goes over and above
the magistrature - otherwise, there is the daily risk of something happening
with serious impact on the economic system . . . Besides, the judiciary
cannot be expected to uncover everything.'
The construction and general contracting business - the sector exposed most
to the magistrates' enquiries - is slowing to a halt throughout Italy
because businessmen fear being accused of bribery. The entire political
establishment and its long-standing incestuous relationship with the
business community is being called into question.
Magistrates have talked of having to put 60,000 people through the courts if
everybody involved in corruption is charged. More than 50 members of
parliament are being investigated for corruption and two party
leaders,Bettino Craxi of the Socialists and Giorgio La Malfa of the
Republicans, have been forced to step down in the past two weeks. More than
400 witnesses will probably be called in the scrutiny of road contracts
alone. One Milan magistrates has suggested that the city's corruption
scandal - over 110 people have been arrested and more than 300 questioned -
will provide the local judicial system with work for the next decade.
As the complete gamut of Italy's institutions - and the people who run them
 -are dragged into the magistrates' net, the country's democracy risks being
weakened. A number of politicians, including Craxi have made this point.
However, it is difficult for the politicians to take action without being
seen as self-serving.
When Milan magistrates began to expose corruption with a series of arrests a
year ago, the reaction in the press was surprise: surprise not that such
wrong-doing existed but that it had come to light. The Milanese even took a
perverse pleasure in saying the expose was possible precisely because the
city had a morality; Naples they argue could never have been the starting
place for a nationwide anti-corruption drive.
Now the public is both angry and taken aback by the systematic scale of the
corruption. 'Corruption has always existed,' veteran television commentator
Vittorio Orefice said recently. 'Like prostitution, it's destined to
eternity. It's a question of containing corruption within the bounds of
decency. We have descended to the level of Cambodia.'
According to Mongini the 'system' being exposed dates back to the 1970s.
Then the Christian Democrats and their allies were terrified that the
powerful Italian Communist Party would come to power through the ballot box.
Knowing that the Communists received secret funding from the Soviet bloc,
they felt no compunction in seeking their own finance to supplement the
small contributions by the state. The Christian Democrats, and then the
smaller Socialist Party, rationalised their large organisational
infrastructure (including tame newspapers and trades unions) by the need to
counter the Communists' presence in the unions, the media and co-operative
movement.
The 'system' centred round the placement of pliant executives in state
companies and municipally controlled entities who then farmed out contracts
on the basis of rigged tenders and accompanying commissions. Alternatively,
the parties had people specially delegated to negotiate kick-backs on
contracts. With the declining threat from communism in the 1980s, the
Communists were allowed to be part of the 'system'. In the case of Milan,
the parties received a fixed percentage of the commissions according to
their share of the electoral vote. This covered every public works contract
including the metro extension, waste disposal, a new municipal theatre and
the modernisation of Linate and Malpensa airports.
As the party bureaucracies swelled, so the need for funds grew. By the 1990s
some 129,000 jobs fed off the political system, yet the annual state subsidy
differences between parties narrowed, loyalties could only be bought with
favours. It was a mutually reinforcing circle that always returned to a
growing appetite for funds. The real cost of running this political
establishment was close to L5,000bn.
Mongini claims that in the late '80s the 'system' degenerated. 'Everyone
wanted to get in on the act, even the smallest bagmen. You would have people
in the local health authorities demanding kick-backs on something as small
as a syringe contract. It got out of hand.'
People became greedy and some of the private sector companies baulked at the
rising demand for bribes. The Socialists have been exposed as the most
flagrant offenders, but the Christian Democrats were more subtle and
seasoned players.
How much did the party bosses in Rome know about what was going on?
'They knew, helped set it up and were also on the take,' says Mongini. 'The
Milan operation of the party cost L2.5bn a year and they gave us L100m a
year from Rome - Rome did not think we used to win the lottery every month
to cover the rest]'
Magistrates have paid particular attention to those running party finances.
Vincenzo Balzamo, the administrative secretary of the Socialist party, died
of a heart attack last November while being investigated for corruption. His
opposite number in the Christian Democrats, Severino Citaristi, has been
served with a record ten warrants notifying him that he is under
investigation for illegal party finance.
It is far from clear whether private business has been a victim or willing
accomplice although companies been touched by the inquiry include Fiat,
Pesenti and Ferruzzi.
'The entrepreneurs are desperately trying to demonstrate they were obliged
to pay by the politicians,' Mongini claims. In Milan, he says, 'the parties
had an interest in getting the money and the entrepreneurs had an interest
in giving it to them. Like couples making love, it was usually by mutual
consent.' The one charge Mongini denies is that of extortion. Companies paid
willingly for the privilege of rigging the bidding process: excluding rival
tenders and fixing the price.
This relationship between business and government has been encouraged by the
practice in Italy of having private tenders. On average, throughout Italy,
two thirds of contracts have been by private tender or have not been subject
to parliamentary scrutiny. In this way contracts are easily rigged or
rewritten in mid-performance. The lack of transparency and the obligatory
inclusion of 'commissions' explains why foreign contractors have, on the
whole, avoided Italy and why contracts has been costly by European
standards.
Mongini says that, of the money he raised, L120m a year went to finance his
faction of Milan's Christian Democrat Party and the rest to central funds.
He denies enriching himself; but calculates that at least one third of money
collected in the 'system' was for personal enrichment - 'but to prove this
you will have look at Swiss bank accounts.'
He says the Milan magistrates have been clever, using every weapon at their
disposal. They made him feel that they were closing in but kept him guessing
for two months. 'When I was eventually arrested in June it was like an act
of liberation. I understand people have gone to extremes awaiting arrest.'
Seven suspects have commited suicide in the past nine months and an eighth
fifth was saved by chance this month after having taken an overdose in a
parked car.
At first Mongini was convinced that, as a lawyer, he could avoid
incriminating himself under interrogation. He resisted for 14 days. Then the
ordeal of prison, combined with the realisation that the magistrates had an
accurate picture of how bribes were collected, convinced him to co-operate.
The Milan magistrates have exploited their right to keep suspects in
detention for three months, and have made a point of arresting those used to
the good life either late at night or early in the morning. Release from
prison has been on a direct reward basis: once suspects confess. By early
this month, 105 of those arrested had confessed.
Mongini observes wryly: 'The reception centre at San Vittorio prison has
become like the foyer at La Scala - where you see anyone and everyone.' But
members of parliament have yet to grace its cells. Under Italian law,
magistrates must first ask parliament to waive the blanket immunity extended
to deputies and senators. This process can take up to five months and the
waiver is by no means guaranteed, especially now that parliament feels it is
being challenged by the magistrature.
So many politicians are already compromised in the scandal that parliament
is in a weak position to take the initiative to prevent the investigations
paralysing the Italian state and its institutions. One Milan magistrate,
Gherardo Colombo has suggested a pardon on the condition that those who have
taken or given contract commissions confess and repay the monies.
Giuliano Amato, the Socialist prime minister, has suggested it is wrong to
focus on those under investigation as the sole culprits. Italian society, he
says, has been an accomplice in tolerating corruption.
Mongini, who hopes he can avoid a full prison sentence, backs such views and
adds. 'The public will not accept a simple pardon; and the best thing is for
all those in power during this period to recognise that they are no longer
acceptable to the Italian people. It is the end of a political class. They
must leave the scene - and that includes me.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / The Long View: Chemical reactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SO ICI has decided to tear itself in twain lest the bell should toll for the
one-time bellwether. Its decision to recreate itself as Zeneca is a clear
indication that the British economy no longer determines the shape of the
stock market, but rather the other way around.
I have referred before to the curious fact that the UK equity market has
consistently outperformed many overseas markets in spite of the poor showing
of the British economy. It happened again last year when the total return on
UK equities was 20.6 per cent against 16.4 per cent on the World ex-UK
Index.
Over the past decade the average UK annual return has been 18.8 per cent
compared with 15.6 per cent overseas. Yet economic growth in Britain has
averaged only 2.3 per cent a year over this period compared with 2.7 per
cent in Germany and the US and 4.1 per cent in Japan. Industrial production
has trailed still more badly in the UK.
The share price action of ICI, of course, corresponds more closely to this
dismal industrial picture. The UK stock market has been lifted by certain
service sectors and by the monopoly utilities privatised at giveaway prices
in the past ten years: these account for 11 per cent of the market's value
and nearly 20 per cent of the underlying profits. Elsewhere, about half the
profits of UK-listed companies are earned overseas. The poor old British
economy has less and less relevance.
The share price action has generally been good, but tension between British
companies and their mainly institutional shareholders is regularly apparent.
The 1980s takeover boom and the subsequent corporate governance debate were
symptoms of that. So long as the shareholders are fed with a regular stream
of dividends, however, there is little trouble. Between 1982 and 1992
capital investment by industrial and commercial companies grew 2.8 times (in
nominal terms) but dividends increased twice as much. During the past two
years of recession dividends have climbed 20 per cent while investment has
been cut back by 13 per cent.
There can be logic in this payment in adversity. Resources that cannot be
invested profitably should be returned to shareholders. The shareholder's
interest can be identified with national interest so long as the rest of the
world is playing the same game. If not, the efficient stock market may
operate as a doomsday machine for the destruction of domestic industry. High
returns may only be achieved at a price.
The aloofness of the British governing classes and the City of London from
domestic industry has long been notorious. It was again highlighted by a
document called Britain, Europe and the Square Mile, published earlier this
month by the European Policy Forum. In pleading the City's special
self-interest in European integration, the paper argued that if the UK
detached itself from the core of the European community there would be a
risk to foreign direct investment. It did not explain why the UK has become
so much more dependent on foreign investment than any other large EC
economy.
Meanwhile, in this year's wave of rights issues, the City has been eagerly
helping UK companies make large acquisitions in France, the US and
elsewhere. As these companies rely more and more on foreign earnings they
find it difficult to maintain dividend growth without exhausting their UK
tax allowances. Typically, their response is to call for tax concessions
from the British government rather than to adopt the low payout policies of
companies in most economies.
Dividends are generally sparse in other leading industrial countries because
the effective ownership of industry is in the hands of the state, of
interlocking domestic corporate interests including banks, or of private
families. None of these interest groups have much need for income; all have
a strong commitment to the domestic economy. The freewheeling British
structure leads, in contrast, to an international portfolio approach on the
part of both institutional investors and corporate empire-builders. The US
is rather similar, but is better-placed to protect its industries - as in
the latest row over steel anti-dumping duties, and the renewed Airbus
dispute - than the UK.
Here is a rough-and-ready summary of the recent decline of British industry.
The profit-driven corporate sector has consistently withdrawn resources from
underperforming sectors, specially heavy industry, a trend exaggerated by
phases of extreme overvaluation of sterling. There were arguments in favour
of this in the context of a growing and liberalising global economy, but we
are moving into an era of recession and protectionism. Recent policies have
led to the appearance of a structural trade gap. Eventual devaluation has
been the logical response, but this will bring help on any substantial scale
only to labour-intensive manufacturing sectors. Heavy industries which are,
say, energy-intensive, and face subsidised competition, will gain little
benefit. ICI has long cross-subsidised its heavy chemicals operations but
this anomaly has been ruthlessly exposed by the stock market, prompted by
Lord Hanson. The rump of ICI will stand little chance of survival.
Inward investment has been one answer to domestic shortfalls, but is it
durable? The Dutch state has naturally been unwilling to go on supporting
Leyland, and it will prove highly dangerous to rely, over anything other
than the short term, on lossmaking Nissan to revive the British motor
industry; remember that Nissan and the other Japanese manufacturers no
longer benefit from a freakishly low cost of capital, as they did in the
1980s.
Britain long ago lost its motor-cycle sector. It has since lost its
domestically-owned car industry too. As things are going the steel, aircraft
and basic chemicals industries will not be far behind.
Zeneca, I fear, has nothing to do with motor-cycle maintenance.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Lloyd's Names face Pounds 200m loss: Stricken syndicate sees
debt estimates rise sharply in recent months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 1,000 Names, including the actress Ms Susan Hampshire, face possible
losses between them of up to Pounds 200m in one of the biggest syndicate
collapses at the troubled Lloyd's insurance market.
The Names, individuals whose assets support underwriting at Lloyd's, are
members of syndicate 475, whose underwriter, Mr Roy Bromley, committed
suicide last month.
Syndicate 475 specialised in 'spiral' reinsurance - in which syndicates and
companies insure each other's exposures to high level catastrophe loss.
Although relatively small with a capacity, or capital base, of Pounds 25m in
1989, its losses are proportionally worse than the better known 'spiral'
syndicates such as those managed by the Gooda Walker and Feltrim agencies.
Its losses are far worse than agents feared two months ago when Names were
told to expect a deficit of about Pounds 50m.
Overall Lloyd's losses are expected to amount to about Pounds 5bn over the
past five years. Despite recent management changes, the market is weighed
down by its past losses and growing legal actions between Names and their
agents.
Mr Trevor Bradley, managing director of Knightstone Group, which took over
management of the syndicate last October, said that 1989 losses could amount
to between Pounds 74.8m and Pounds 175.7m, with Names losing a maximum of
Pounds 70,000 for every Pounds 10,000 traded on the syndicate.
Further losses of between Pounds 18m and Pounds 32.6m are forecast for 1990,
when Names stand to lose up to Pounds 13,000 for every Pounds 10,000 traded.
'It is a very sad affair,' said Mr Bradley, who predicted losses would fall
midway between best and worst case estimates. The syndicate's own
reinsurance was insufficient to cover losses stemming from hurricane Hugo in
1989, the European storms of 1990 and a string of other losses.
Mr Bradley said that claims would continue to affect the syndicate for many
years. Names would be asked to pay only Pounds 21.3m of the 1989 loss this
year, following a request for about Pounds 12m last year.
Mr Bromley lost his job as underwriter in May 1991 and had become dispirited
about the way the syndicate's losses had mounted.
'Things were going badly for him. There is no doubt he was very distressed
about the way things were going,' said Dr Paul Knapman, the coroner, at his
inquest last week.
Mr Bromley's son, Nicholas, told the inquest: 'He was calm on the surface,
but underneath it there was a degree of panic and fear.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Reshuffle option increases pressure on Lamont
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major is keeping open the option of an extensive cabinet reshuffle
during the summer to restore the government's battered authority.
His stance leaves a question mark over Mr Norman Lamont's hold on the
Treasury and increases pressure on the chancellor to produce an imaginative
budget on March 16.
But the scope for a popular Budget package has been limited by a shift of
mood in the cabinet towards an early increase in personal taxation to curb
the public sector deficit and provide scope for new measures to help
industry and the unemployed.
Close associates of the prime minister dismiss recent suggestions at
Westminster that he has decided to keep his senior cabinet colleagues in
their present posts until 1994. Instead, Mr Major would review after the
Budget possibilities for high-level changes before the summer parliamentary
recess.
The chancellor has indicated he would like to deliver both the March Budget
and the second Budget due in November.
The prime minister has refused to speculate on the possibilities of a summer
reshuffle. His only comment to journalists returning with him from
Washington this week was that a shake-up was not 'imminent'. That was
interpreted as meaning it would not come before the Budget and probably not
before the Commons third reading of the Maastricht bill in May or June.
But the general view among Tory MPs at Westminster is that Mr Lamont has
failed to recover his political authority since sterling's ignominious exit
from the European Exchange Rate Mechanism last autumn. If he is moved - to
the Home Office or defence - Mr Kenneth Clarke and Mr Michael Howard would
be front-runners for the Treasury.
Mr Major is also under pressure to bring in fresh talent to the government
by dropping some longer-serving ministers inherited from Lady Thatcher.
There is speculation at Westminster that one cabinet minister has indicated
privately that he is ready to stand down and the planned departure of Mr
Tristan Garel-Jones from the foreign office will leave vacant a post just
below cabinet level.
Among ministers of state tipped by Tory party managers for promotion are Mr
Stephen Dorrell at the Treasury, Mr John Redwood at environment and Mr Roger
Freeman at transport.

FT  27 FEB 93 / German wages pact raises rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S banking unions yesterday agreed to a 3.3 per cent wage settlement
with their employers, effectively completing this year's west German wages
round and prompting speculation that the Bundesbank might ease monetary
policy next week.
News of the wage agreement, which was below the projected rate of German
inflation, triggered a surge on European stockmarkets and helped to depress
the D-Mark against most other European currencies.
The London stock market gained 39.3 points to close within 6 points of its
previous all-time closing high, at 2,868. Frankfurt's 30-share DAX index
closed 25.44 points higher at 1,684.35 and the CAC-40 index in Paris gained
39.07 points to finish at 1,983.71.
The dollar also rose against the D-Mark as dealers contemplated the
possibility that the Bundesbank would ease rates at its council meeting next
Thursday. Officials have said that moderate wage deals are an important
requirement if it is to cut rates.
The negotiations over wages in the German banking sector followed the
pattern of most earlier agreements, completed quickly and without industrial
action.
Most forecasts for German inflation suggest that there will be an annual
rate of price increases between 3.5 per cent and 4 per cent.
Most unions started out with claims for increases of more than 6 per cent,
but the recent rapid onset of recession and announcements of sweeping job
losses have had a dramatic effect on expectations.
A 3 per cent wage deal for Germany's 3m public sector employees came the day
after the Bundesbank cut the discount rate by  1/4 percentage point to 8 per
cent and the Lombard rate by  1/2 point to 9 per cent.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Former Ferruzzi chief is drawn into corruption probe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S business elite was dealt a further blow by the announcement
yesterday that Mr Raul Gardini, the high profile former head of
Ferruzzi-Montedison, was under investigation by Milan magistrates.
Mr Gardini is being investigated for his role in the controversial
reorganisation of Italy's chemicals industry at the end of the 1980s, when
the main chemical interests of ENI, the state oil concern, were pooled with
Montedison, the chemicals arm of the Ferruzzi group.
Mr Sergio Cragnotti, the financier and president of Lazio football club who
was a former managing director of Montedison, was also told yesterday that
he was under investigation. This means all key business participants in the
restructuring are being investigated.
No politicians have been implicated; but the investigation was this week
switched from Rome to Milan where inquiries are related to the alleged
involvement of politicians.
It also emerged yesterday that the magistrates' enquiries include the
establishment of Enimont in 1989. Previously the enquiry focused solely on
the purchase price of L2,805bn paid by ENI for Ferruzzi's 40 per cent stake
in Enimont in 1990.
News that Mr Gardini and Mr Cragnotti were under investigation followed a
week in which several prominent figures in the business world had been
caught up by the fast moving scandals.
Those arrested on charges of alleged illicit financing of political parties
included Mr Francesco Paolo Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr
Giampiero Pesenti, the owner of Italy's biggest cement company.
Yesterday Mr Mattioli was still being detained in a Milan prison.
The uncertainties created by developments in the corruption investigations
continued to weaken the lira. The Bank of Italy is believed to have sold
D-Marks yesterday for the third time this week.
The Bank and the treasury took the unprecedented step of issuing a sharp
joint statement rebutting Moody's announcement on Thursday which placed the
Aa3 foreign currency debt rating of Italy under review for a possible
downgrade.
The Enimont enquiry already involves Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the current head
of ENI, and Mr Lorenzo Necci, the first president of Enimont and now head of
Italian railways, FS. Magistrates are also anxious to interview Mr Giuseppe
Garofano, a long-time director of Montedison.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The protracted negotiation between British Airways and Virgin suggests the
lawyers are also anxious for their pound of flesh. But BA's shareholders
deserve a convincing answer as to why their money is being given to an
arch-rival. Some of the payment may relate to the resolution of a relatively
innocuous dispute over a maintenance contract. The rest will represent
compensation for the commercial damage caused by BA's 'dirty tricks'
campaign. BA has insisted that these actions were regrettable but minor. If
so, why is the compensation likely to run into millions?

FT  27 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Airtours/Owners Abroad
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
With the quibbles of the Office of Fair Trading brushed aside by Mr Michael
Heseltine, the combatants in the package tour market have returned to
battling each other. Owners is certainly making a spirited fight of it. The
company has now promised a 43 per cent increase in this year's dividend and
outlined increased benefits from its preferred alliance with Thomas Cook.
This firmly lobs the beach ball back into Airtours' court.
The market suggests Airtours will have to increase its offer. Airtours wants
a quick resolution to ensure it benefits fully from Owners' summer holiday
profits. Its cause would be greatly helped by a recommendation for any
increased offer. But given Owners' fierce criticism of an enlarged Airtours'
future prospects, it is unlikely to win approval for a largely paper offer.
Airtours has more reason than ever, therefore, to increase the cash
alternative.

FT  27 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Investment Trusts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Buyers of investment trust shares have often worried about the industry's
unhealthy cosiness. Although, in theory, there are clear divisions of
responsibility between directors and managers, such distinctions have often
become blurred. Conflicts of interest result. Directors should act solely in
the best interests of shareholders and replace poorly-performing managers.
But this is difficult when directors and managers are the same. Trickier
still when the trust is named after the management group which happens to be
a big shareholder.
To its credit, the industry is trying to address the problem. In the wake of
the Cadbury Committee report on corporate governance, the Association of
Investment Trust Companies has published guidelines on best practice. These
suggest a trust's board should have a majority of independent directors. It
is also desirable for the chairman to be independent.
Many older investment trusts already have well-developed checks and
balances. The main worry concerns the host of new investment trusts which
have sprung up in recent years. In its annual study of the sector, NatWest
Securities worryingly finds that almost half the directors on the boards of
the 117 investment trusts launched since 1986 are closely linked with
management groups. It argues that the AITC's recommendations do not go far
enough, suggesting there should be no managers on the board at all - apart,
perhaps, from the managing director.
However, the ultimate sanction will always remain with shareholders. Either
they shun those trusts failing to comply with best practice, or they replace
the directors.

FT  27 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Severn Trent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It comes as no surprise that Severn Trent is the first privatised water
company to buy one of its smaller statutory neighbours. Having blazed the
trail in waste management with the acquisition of Biffa, there is clearly no
shortage of ambition. The Pounds 33m acquisition of East Worcester is only a
drop in the ocean of Severn Trent's core water business. Even so,
shareholders mindful of Biffa's dismal performance might take comfort that,
in this case, Severn Trent should know exactly what it is buying.
The deal sets something of a precedent for other privatised water companies.
The regulator is evidently happy so long as benefits flow to customers in
the form of lower charges. That will be taken as a green light by the rest
of the industry. Even so, it is difficult to envisage a takeover binge.
Giving East Worcester access to Severn Trent's network is a neat solution to
an otherwise expensive supply problem. Cost savings in other cases will be
more difficult to find. Acquisitions valued over Pounds 30m in terms of net
assets - East Worcester is worth Pounds 16m on this basis - face an
automatic monopolies investigation. That alone may be enough to discourage
Severn Trent from bidding for the larger quoted South Staffordshire.

FT  27 FEB 93 / The Lex Column: Forgotten rights
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's smart rise in UK equities ends two weeks of torpor during which
the market was caught between fear of rights issues, hopes for recovery and
the dwindling return on cash. With ICI's Pounds 1.3bn cash call now
postponed until June, investors have evidently tired of shadow-boxing on the
first point. But that does not leave much headroom from here. Yesterday's
rise was led by the big overseas earners rather than domestic recovery
stocks. Results from the likes of NatWest this week showed scant evidence of
an upturn. Besides, ICI will not be the last to announce a rights issue
before the reporting season is over.
With around Pounds 2bn in rights issues and Pounds 5bn soaked up by gilts
issues this year, institutional liquidity is already starting to look
stretched. The Pounds 500m net inflow into unit trusts during January was
encouraging, but only a portion will flow into UK equities. Besides, the ICI
rights issue alone will account for perhaps three months' inflows at that
rate of progress. When the government starts funding in earnest in the
spring, competition for savings can only increase.
The strength of blue-chip stocks could be a sign of renewed overseas
interest. That would relieve the pressure on domestic cash. Having seen
sterling bounce from an all-time low against the D-Mark this week,
foreigners may be tempted to see the UK currency as a safe bet. The mood of
continental stock and bond markets suggests some optimism that the
Bundesbank will cut interest rates. If that was combined with nascent
economic recovery at home, sterling would certainly benefit. The worry is
that waiting has proved thankless in the past.

Dow Jones

<TEXT>
Wall Street
AN explosion and fire at New York's World Trade Centre at midday yesterday
caused only minimal disruption to trading on the New York and American stock
exchanges, although the small order execution system was suspended, writes
Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 5.67 at 3,370.81. The more
broadly-based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 firmed 1.05 at 443.39, and the Nasdaq
composite rose about 2 points to 669. NYSE trading volume was 234m shares
and rises outnumbered declines by 1,160 to 746.
Regular Nasdaq trading was uninterrupted at midday, but some trading floors
were evacuated because of the fire and more than a dozen trading desks had
to be closed because of power failure and smokey conditions.
Market sentiment was mixed, in spite of an upward revision of gross domestic
product for the fourth quarter to an annual rate of 4.8 per cent, above an
earlier estimate of 3.8 per cent.
Wal-Mart was active and gained Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 32 1/2 . Tobacco
stocks remained lively, with RJR Nabisco adding Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8
1/2 and Philip Morris Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 67 1/8 . In the auto sector,
General Motors fell  1/4 to Dollars 37 1/2 , Chrysler rose Dollars  3/4 to
Dollars 39 5/8 and Ford fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 45 7/8 .
Rollins Environmental dropped Dollars 1 to Dollars 7 7/8 after the US
brokerage, Alex Brown, cut its rating on the stock from 'neutral' to 'sell'
following the shutdown of the company's Texas incinerator.
Telefonos de Mexico climbed Dollars 2 to Dollars 49 5/8 in active trading
after Bear Stearns increased its rating to 'strong buy' to reflect
expectations of continued operating profit growth.
In the big board technology sector, shares in Hewlett-Packard fell Dollars 2
to Dollars 74 and Digital Equipment fell Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 47 3/4
after a new technology analyst at Kemper Securities issued an initial
'neutral' rating on the stocks and suggested that investors swap into them
from IBM and Amdahl. Shares in International Business Machines rose Dollars
 5/8 to Dollars 54 3/8 .
The biotechnology bellwether stock, Amgen, fell  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/4 in
Nasdaq trading. The stock dropped more than Dollars 9 on Thursday following
disappointing first quarter earnings projections.
Many Nasdaq technology stocks were broadly lower with Intel off Dollars 1
1/2 to Dollars 116 1/2 , Seagate Technology down Dollars 1 to Dollars 15 5/8
, Apple Computer off Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 53 7/8 and Dell Computer
easing Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 32 1/8 .
Shares in Buttrey Food &amp; Drug tumbled Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 6 7/8 after
the company posted fourth quarter operating income of 3 cents a share
against 25 cents a year earlier.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed mixed in heavy trading, dragged down by lower gold
stocks. According to preliminary data, the TSE-300 index was off 8.25
points, or 0.24 per cent, to 3,451.69, but advances outnumbered declines 366
to 278. On the week, the index was up 26 points.
Volume fell to 49.424m shares from 54.607m shares on Thursday, and trading
value was CDollars 412.1m against CDollars 492m.
Ten of the 14 stock groups were down, led by golds, which fell 1.91 per
cent. Industrial products fell, and financial services, consumer products
and mining were flat.

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES moved in a narrow range ahead of talks between the Group of Seven
finance ministers, and the Nikkei average closed marginally higher in quiet
trading, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei closed up 45.96 at 16,953.35, fractionally lower on the week,
after moving between 16,884.82 and 16,985.55. Share prices were led by
futures trading, rising at the close on arbitrage buying.
Volume remained flat at 250m shares against 258m. Gains led losses by 490 to
459 with 188 unchanged, and the Topix index of all first section stocks rose
6.01 to 1,284.21. In London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.34 to 1,033.23.
While some uncertainty remains over the currency markets and direction of
the yen after the G7 meeting, traders said that the stock market is likely
to remain around 17,000 for another two to three weeks.
Exporting companies, recently hit by the rising yen, gained ground on
bargain hunting, while some dealers started to select beneficiaries of the
proposed additional emergency fiscal package.
Leading electronics makers firmed. Hitachi rose Y17 to Y691, NEC advanced
Y14 to Y638 and TDK rose Y100 to Y3,230. Aids-related stocks, which had been
sold on liquidation of margin positions, rebounded on bargain hunting. Green
Cross rose Y20 to Y1,170 and Okamoto Industries advanced Y24 to Y1,000.
Showa Shell Sekiyu, the most active issue of the day, fell Y24 to Y801
following Thursday's resignation of the company president, Mr Takeshi Henmi,
taking responsibility for its Y125bn foreign exchange losses.
Property companies lost ground on reports of lower profit estimates. Mitsui
Fudosan fell Y10 to Y980 and Mitsubishi Estate lost Y1 to Y899.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 47.72 to 18,105.61 in volume of 70.3m shares.
Roundup
PACIFIC Rim markets generally continued their firm performances.
HONG KONG moved strongly ahead in heavy trading as hopes of a resumption of
Sino-British talks on the colony's future brought strong demand from foreign
investors.
The Hang Seng index rose 148.11 - 2.4 per cent higher on the day and 2.9 per
cent on the week - to 6,351.99 in turnover that rose to HKDollars 4.57bn.
HSBC Holdings, HKDollars 1.5 higher at HKDollars 65, and Hang Seng Bank,
HKDollars 2 ahead at HKDollars 63, which will be among the first companies
to announce annual results next month, led the active list.
TAIWAN was also a strong performer as investors gave a broad welcome to the
new cabinet and the market rose 2.9 per cent to a seven-month high. The
weighted index added 121.75 to 4,278.63 or 9.3 per cent on the week in
turnover of TDollars 68.5bn, the heaviest since May 1991.
Financial shares were actively sought on the view that the new finance
minister Lin Chen-kuo would resist efforts to resume privatisations in the
banking sector.
AUSTRALIA was revived after a quiet start by the expiry of almost 52m
options, which helped the All Ordinaries index to pick up from an early
decline to close 2.7 higher at 1,609.6, 0.9 per cent higher on the week.
Among issues in which options were exercised, News Corp and TNT each closed
1 cent lower at ADollars 7.46 and 73 cents respectively, while Fletcher
Challenge rose 2 cents to ADollars 1.82.
SINGAPORE retreated after three record sessions as investors awaited details
of the budget which came after the market closed. The Straits Times
Industrial index fell 16.46 to 1,664.50, 1.5 per cent higher on the week.
Inchcape, which announced on Thursday that it was selling its timber
business, fell 85 cents to SDollars 6.25 in volume of 2.96m shares.

FT  27 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German banks gain on wages
settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED speculation that the Bundesbank might ease interest rates next week
provided a backdrop to yesterday's activity, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT accelerated Thursday's uptrend, with specific strength in banks
and construction stocks as the DAX index rose 25.44, or 1.5 per cent to
1,684.35, 0.4 per cent higher on a mixed week.
Turnover rose from DM5.4bn to DM7.9bn, Deutsche Bank leading in DM1.35bn
with both Dresdner and Commerzbank also making the top ten active stocks
list. The sector liked the 3.3 per cent banking wage settlement, well below
expectations according to Mr James Hyde of Williams de Broe; constructions
saw good results from Bilfinger &amp; Berger, and Strabag.
Banks were led higher by Commerzbank which has shown relative strength in
advance of, and now after, its rights issue with a DM8 gain to DM283. Mr
Hyde said that the underlying improvements in its costs and income were
enough to offset its problematic loan book.
Bilfinger put on DM50 to DM990 in a sector where 3 to 5 per cent gains were
the order of the day, as the market was brought to see that the sector, this
year at least, seemed recession proof.
But it was a building materials company which really outperformed:
Heidelberger Zement closed DM75, or nearly 8 per cent higher at DM1,050. Mr
Michael Geiger of NatWest Securities reckons that the company could see a 50
per cent jump in net profits for 1992, with the elimination of losses in the
US and the growth of its building additives business in the eastern German
refurbishment market.
PARIS closed higher but most of the activity was accounted for by technical
trading as turnover rose to a hefty FFr4.7bn. The CAC-40 index closed 39.07
higher at 1,983.71, 2.4 per cent higher on the week.
In the corporate sector, speculation that Pernod Ricard might be a takeover
target, possibly for a UK group, pushed the shares up FFr19.50 or 5 per cent
to FFr417.00, while Moulinex rose FFr5.10 to FFr100.10 on reports that it
might be seeking a partner.
In spite of a US broker's downgrade, Elf rose FFr10.70 to FFr377.40 on
firmer oil prices while financials all gained on hopes for lower interest
rates with Societe Generale moving up FFr21 to FFr645. MILAN turned its
attention to insurance stocks as the cabinet discussed plans for pension
funds. Generali fixed L550 higher at L34,960, before rising to L35,550 after
hours. RAS added L974 to L24,883 while Alleanza gained L792 or 5.2 per cent
to L16,112.
The Comit index rose 6.41 to 513.21 or 2 per cent on the week, refusing to
be deflected by the growing political scandal or Moody's decision to put the
country's foreign debt rating under review for a possible downgrade.
Montedison dipped L31 to L1,219 with analysts noting that news of the
investigation of its former chairman Mr Raul Gardini would have no impact on
the company.
Sme gained L273 to L6,261 in response to Thursday's announcement by Iri, the
state holding company, of criteria for the food group's flotation.
ZURICH's SMI index rose 38.1, or 1.8 per cent to 2,099.4, down 0.8 per cent
on the week. After the bank's 1992 results, UBS bearers rose SFr8 to SFr939
in active trade. Mr Frederick Hasslauer of Swiss Volksbank in Zurich said
that while the UBS profits were at the lower end of expectations, the SFr2 a
share rise in dividend was a positive move and that investors were relieved
that no rights issue had been announced.
The chemicals sector, under heavy pressure early in the week, bounced back
on the view that prices had fallen too far. Ciba-Geigy rose SFr10 to SFr635,
Roche added SFr100 to SFr3,950 francs, and Sandoz put on SFr50 to SFr2,960.
MADRID rallied in thin volume, the general index rising 4.89, or more than 2
per cent to 232.89 to close slightly down on the week. Ms Anna MacDonald,
who heads Spanish research at Baring Securities, said that people had
accepted that depreciation of the peseta within the ERM was inevitable, but
that they were staying in equities for the lower interest rates which should
be the corollary.
STOCKHOLM gained on falling domestic interest rates, the Affarsvarlden
General index rising 10.9 to 1,000.1 for a week's gain of 0.8 per cent.
Turnover fell back to SKr807m from Thursday's SKr973m.
Astra managed to restore some of the losses made earlier in the week after
the market interpreted its results as disappointing. The B shares put on
SKr24 to SKr685, still 1.3 per cent lower on the week. Handelsbanken A rose
SKr4 to a new year's high of SKr69 while the B's were flat at SKr63.50.

FT  27 FEB 93 / World Stock Markets: Dutch cyclicals falter as defensives
strengthen - The dichotomy remains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dramatic demise of Daf in recent weeks is a disturbing sign of the times
for long-suffering cyclical stocks on Amsterdam's stock exchange.
In spite of past predictions that cyclical shares were about to take off,
investors continue to focus on defensive stocks such as banks, insurers,
publishers and food companies. This leaves chemicals, paper and transport
groups languishing on the sidelines, awaiting an often predicted, but
frequently postponed resurgence.
For Daf, recovery will come too late. The company, whose shares came to the
market at Fl 47 in 1989, collapsed into receivership in early February. A
privately-held successor, DAF Trucks, rose out of the ashes yesterday,
partly as the result of financial support by the Dutch and Belgian
governments, but investors in the 'old' Daf were left holding worthless
shares.
The bad news surrounding Daf has coincided with tales of woe and reduced
profitability at other cyclicals, including Hoogovens, caught in the steel
sector's crisis, Fokker, KLM, DSM and Akzo, and the paper and packaging
companies, KNP and Buhrmann-Tetterode.
Most analysts do not expect cyclicals to start recovering until the second
half of 1993, ahead of a economic upswing in Europe in 1994 and 1995. But
the rest of the market is expected to post further gains in 1993, even
although the mainstays - publishers, banks, insurance companies and food
companies - have already enjoyed a good run.
The dichotomy between defensive and cyclical stocks is being heightened by
the release of 1992 results, which began in earnest this week. Akzo, which
has done better than many of its international competitors, saw its shares
fall sharply on Wednesday after unveiling a 3 per cent profit rise and
warning that first-half profits might be lower.
Unilever, by contrast, was rewarded for its results with a new 12-month high
yesterday of Fl 208.50. Other stocks to hit similar records this week were
ABN Amro Bank and ING, the banking and insurance group, which analysts see
as a further illustration that financials are not yet overpriced.
'By international standards, Dutch financial stocks are still very cheap and
they could well outperform foreign financials,' says Mr Dirk de Jong, an
analyst at Van Meer James Capel, who forecasts that the equity market will
produce a total return of 20 per cent in 1993 compared with some 7 per cent
in 1992.
At Kempen &amp; Co, Mr Fokko Tuin comments that quality stocks will continue to
benefit from re-rating by foreign investors, who have realised that the
market is comparatively cheap and that Dutch companies have strong balance
sheets. This has led investors to pay more than 18 times earnings for
recession-proof publishers such as Elsevier and Wolters Kluwer.
There is room for further price gains in 1993, he says, but they will be
relatively limited. 'We see the general share index at somewhere between 210
and 220 points by the end of the year,' Mr Tuin says. Since the beginning of
the year the index has risen some 6.3 per cent.
The timing of an eventual rise in cyclical shares is one of the most vexing
issues facing investors and analysts. Twice during 1992 cyclicals seemed
poised for a rally, but the rises later stalled in the absence of
substantial interest rate cuts by the Bundesbank and the lack of evidence of
economic recovery. Currency devaluations in Britain, Italy and Scandinavia
in the autumn presented new problems for cyclicals, which are heavily
dependent on European exports. In the end, the 3.5 per cent increase in the
general share index in 1992 was carried by the publishers, banks and
insurance companies, which both registered gains of more than 20 per cent,
helping to overcome a decline of nearly 40 per cent in paper stocks and
other cyclical sectors.
Still, analysts say, the importance of cyclicals should not be exaggerated,
nor should they obscure the strength of other parts of the market.
Mr de Jong notes that the cyclical companies account for just 10 per cent of
the market's equity capitalisation, compared with the 30 per cent share held
by manufacturing and cyclical shares in Germany.
Although the cyclical companies may be grabbing the headlines, their
relatively small market share means that Dutch listed companies as a whole
are forecast to show profit gains in 1993 - analysts' estimates range from 7
per cent to 13 per cent - while Germany's companies could well see flat
results. This augurs well for the market, as do expected lower interest
rates and a stable dollar.
In the short term, however, attention is focused on 1992 earnings. A climax
of sorts will be reached on Thursday, when DSM, which has a big presence in
cyclical bulk chemicals, Philips, considered by some analysts to be a
cyclical share, and Heineken, a classic defensive stock, all unveil results.
The market has already discounted a halving of DSM's dividend to Fl 4 in
1991. But Mr Tuin of Kempen says: 'If the dividend turns out to be Fl 3, I
think DSM could fall by 10 per cent.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: GUS active
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A report in the trade press that Great Universal Stores is poised to
rekindle its interest in the property market provided the latest hint that
liquidity may be returning to the moribund sector. GUS, which has a property
investment portfolio worth more than Pounds 600m, was seen as displaying
good timing in reducing property activity before the boom years of 1989-90.
By apparently expanding again, the group is viewed in some quarters as
another harbinger of revival in the commercial property market.
The trade report prompted broker Hoare Govett to change its stance on the
stock moving from a sell to undervalued. Analyst Ms Emma Burdett said: 'A
gradual return to property is a positive move by GUS which will be able to
use its cash in something with a good yield at a time of declining interest
rates.' She added that the stock had underperformed in the last quarter and
the shares were now looking better value. The 'A's closed 13 ahead at 1643p.
GUS, which has cash reserves of over Pounds 1bn, played down the report, a
spokesman asserting: 'We have no crash programme to invest.'
The UK's two leading oil exploration and production (E&amp;P) stocks, Enterprise
Oil and Lasmo, were the best performers in the oil sector.
One specialist said Lasmo started the ball rolling, moving up strongly after
a stock overhang had been cleared and amid vague takeover talk, dragging
Enterprise up with it.
There were suggestions that Enterprise had been talking to US institutions
but that was seen as unlikely as Enterprise is in the 'closed period' and
consequently prevented from discussing its trading progress. Enterprise is
due to report preliminary figures on March 11. Lasmo closed 7 higher at 8 up
at 182p and Enterprise 16 firmer at 476p.
Pharmaceuticals and scientific instruments group Fisons, which is expected
to show a profit fall to between Pounds 100m and Pounds 120m from 1991's
Pounds 190.5m when it reports on Tuesday, slipped 3 to 241p. However, the
market expects the dividend to be maintained at 8.7p a share.
Glaxo gained 22 to 667p as analysts noted that the US Food and Drug
Administration advisory committee was meeting to discuss the company's
Serevent asthma drug. The meeting had been known about for some time but
investors are expecting good news. There was also some talk that the company
might make a bid for Smith &amp; Nephew. The potential link was greeted with
disbelief, but there was activity in Smith which rose 5 1/2 to 156p on
turnover of 3.9m.
A difficult week for the high street banks closed with the sector staging a
strong fight back after the bout of downside pressure triggered earlier by
higher than expected bad debts at NatWest.
Abbey National, reporting on Tuesday and expected to increase the annual
dividend in excess of 10 per cent, jumped 10 more to a 398p.
Hambros eased a penny to 313p, with one securities house said to have bought
a block of 1.9m shares - around 1 per cent of those in issue - at 311 1/2 p
and placed them in the market at 313p.
Composite insurances showed General Accident 10 up at 569p, despite strong
suggestions that a big fund raising could accompany next Tuesday's
preliminary results which should see the group reveal losses much reduced at
around Pounds 30m, compared with last time's Pounds 171m loss.
A 5 per cent rise in the price of Pernod shares in Paris revived old
speculation of a bid and rights issue from Allied Lyons. Allied's shares
reflected the disinterest for the story in London and rose 2 to 587p.
Kingfisher was hounded by a combination of worries over the French economy,
a negative press article and profit-taking, all on the back of its recent
purchase of Darty, the French electrical retailer. The shares tumbled 12 to
544p.
Unilever's post-results run continued, the shares adding 17 to 1225p. There
were also reports of switching from the NV into the PLC shares by investors
seeking a double dividend.
P &amp; O firmed 3 to 549p, with NatWest Securities having recommended the
stock. The securities house believes the dividend is secure and said that
when the company reports figures towards the end of the month, 'writedowns
of land and properties will affect both the results and balance sheets but
these will generally be seen as history, whereas the sterling devaluation
will confer increasing benefits'.
Pearson shares fell 16 before closing 10 down at 381p after a block of about
1.2m shares were sold at 383p overnight.

FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: US chases ICI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US buying ensured heavy volume in ICI shares following the hefty gain on
Thursday when the company announced results, demerger details and a Pounds
1.3bn cash call.
The shares were actively traded in New York on Thursday night where the
American Depositary Receipts rose Dollars 3 1/4 . In London, they opened 19
ahead and moved forward steadily to close 55 1/2 up at 1208p on turnover of
10m. Prices were squeezed higher as many UK dealers were caught short by the
extent of the US enthusiasm. Specialists said yesterday that the shares were
rapidly approaching a resistance barrier between 1250p and 1350p and there
was likely to be a lull in trading ahead of the rights issue in May.
Meanwhile, chemicals group Courtaulds saw its shares rise 10 to 566p in
sympathy with the ICI performance.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG support for British Gas, apparently from income funds seeking to take
advantage of the 3.5 per cent yield on the final dividend, drove the shares
up sharply to close 9 higher at 298p. Buying was additionally fuelled by
reports that James Capel, the leading agency broker, had upgraded its
dividend forecasts for the company after Gas's 1992 figures announced on
Thursday.
The income funds are expected to be keen supporters of the stock until it
goes ex-dividend on May 10. However, some specialists cautioned that the
outcome of the inquiry being carried out by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission may be made public before that time.

FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLID buying on the last day of the equity account led to a shortage of
stock in futures, sending the March contract on the FT-SE sharply ahead,
writes Joel Kibazo.
It started trading tentatively at 2,835, a sizeable selling order early in
the day sent the contract falling to 2,832, but then firm buying led March
higher for most of the session.
The buying was encouraged by renewed speculation about a cut in German
interest rates, and a firm UK gilts sector. This demand and covering of
short positions by traders led to a squeeze in March and it was trading at
2,873 ahead of the opening of Wall Street.
Further demand saw it close at the day's high of 2,878, up 47 on its
previous close and at a 6-point premium to cash. Turnover was a healthy
13,815 contracts.
In traded options, volume improved to 29,949 lots with 11,747 lots dealt in
the FT-SE 100 options. Interest in ICI continued to ensure that it was the
day's most actively dealt stock option with 2,238 contracts traded. It was
followed by British Steel at 1,931.

FT  27 FEB 93 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie approaches its closing peak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPRIEVED, for the time being at least, from the impact of the blue chip
rights issue threatened at the beginning of the week, the London stock
market rebounded strongly yesterday, gaining 39.3 points to close within six
points of its previous all-time closing high.
Speculation on the chances of a German rate cut gave a final boost to stocks
in London. Gilt-edged issues extended their gains at the end of the session.
There was renewed US demand for ICI shares and the end of the two-week
equity market account prompted a rush of bear closing - buying from market
traders needing shares to meet selling commitments accepted earlier this
week.
The bear rush was headed by UK buyers of ICI, who were in turn reacting to
heavy demand for the shares in New York overnight. London traders are
believed to have suffered heavy losses on ICI shares, which they sold down
to 1076p on Monday; the shares ended at just over Pounds 12 in London last
night and were attracting renewed US support.
Upward pressures on share prices received a further boost as the final deals
related to the Pounds 200m-plus buy programme seen earlier in the week were
hurriedly transacted.
Equities moved ahead strongly throughout the session, receiving a final
boost as the new trading account opened.
The FT-SE Index closed 39.3 up at 2,868, just under its closing high of
2,873.8 achieved on February 3 - on the following day, the Footsie traded
briefly at 2,900.1. By last night, the Index has recovered all the ground
lost since last Friday to show a net gain of 28 points over the week. The
change in the Index over the two-week equity account is much the same (25
points).
The market has moved through its trading range this week, dipping to 2,809
on Thursday and challenging 2,873 at yesterday's peak. Sentiment has been
dominated by the swing of views ahead of the ICI trading and demerger
statement, culminating in relief that the Pounds 1.3bn rights issue will not
hit the market until June. Violent swings in the ICI share price have had a
significant effect on market indices.
Seaq volume increased in late trading as London caught the hint of optimism
on German interest rates. The final Seaq total of 671.3m shares compared
with 620.6m on Thursday, with both figures swollen by the excitement in ICI
and the other pharmaceutical leaders.
Non-Footsie volume made up around 61 per cent of yesterday's total. Retail
business in equities has remained high in London.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Money Markets: Rate cut envisaged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was strong speculation yesterday that the Bundesbank would ease
monetary policy next week after the German banking unions accepted a 3.3 per
cent pay rise for its members, writes James Blitz.
Yesterday's deal followed the recent 3.0 per cent rise for public sector
workers, and may have led the Bundesbank to believe that pay deals would
remain within a 3 to 4 per cent range.
That was one reason why dealers were yesterday more bullish about the
prospect of the Bundesbank easing rates at its council meeting next week.
Recent calls by the Bundesbank for a speedy conclusion to the solidarity
pact have also raised speculation that the German central bank wants to ease
rates as soon as possible.
The March Euromark contract rose 10 basis points on the day to close at
91.99, a level which assumes that 3-month money on March 15th will be at
8.01 per cent.
That assumed that there would be a 30 basis point dip in the cost of 3-month
cash in the next fourteen days.
French franc futures also enjoyed a rally, with the March contract rising 29
basis points to close at 88.38.
This came despite a weaker performance by the French currency and the fact
that 3-month French franc interest rates have failed to dip below 12 per
cent.
Many dealers believe that the council meeting on March 4th is the last
chance for the Bundesbank to ease policy before the March contracts expire
and the parliamentary elections in France begin.
But in spite of yesterday's stronger performance, the pessimists over
Bundesbank policy were still out in force yesterday.
'We know what should happen and what needs to happen, but none of us know
when it will,' said one dealer last night.
Sterling futures were caught up in yesterday's rallies, despite a colossal
shortage in the discount market.
The Bank of England forecast a shortage of Pounds 2.9bn yesterday, but it
was removed without the need for late assistance.
Three-month money again closed at 6 1/8 per cent. The March short sterling
contract rose 8 basis points at one stage, to peak at 94.11, but later fell
to a close of 94.04. At this level it is virtually assuming unchanged base
rates until after the budget.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises on GDP figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR checked its recent fall against the D-Mark yesterday following
the strong upward revision for US fourth quarter GDP that the market had
been expecting, writes James Blitz.
The annualised 4.8 per cent rise in GDP in the last 3 months of 1992,
against an original estimate of 3.1 per cent, helped the dollar to peak at
DM1.6470 in the early afternoon in Europe.
However, dealers appeared to be following the old adage 'buy on the rumour
and sell on the facts', and the US currency later slipped to a close of
DM1.6415, a net 0.7 pfennigs up on the day.
The dollar's rise was also helped by a growing feeling that the Bundesbank
may ease monetary policy again at its council meeting next Thursday.
Dealers appeared to think that there would no cut in Germany's officially
posted rates. However, a softening of the rate at which the Bundesbank
provides wholesale funds to commercial banks was deemed more likely.
The German banking union's decision to settle on a 3.3 per cent wage rise
for its 430,000 workers was one reason for the optimism on German rate cuts.
Following the public sector unions' decision to keep wage rises to 3.0 per
cent, the chances of inflation being contained within ranges that the
Bundesbank would find acceptable is now seen to be more likely.
Another factor signalling a near-term cut in rates was the recent call from
Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the Bundesbank vice-president, for urgent action to
conclude the drawn-out solidarity pact negotiations in Bonn between the
government, the federal states and the opposition.
One dealer interpreted this call as a sign that the Bundesbank wants to ease
monetary policy as quickly as possible.
The dollar was underpinned against the yen by a growing belief that there
will be no accord by the G7 finance ministers meeting in London today to
maintain a strong yen against the dollar.
An announcement that there will be no formal communique following the
meeting reinforced this view. The Japanese authorities are concerned that a
strong yen will restrict their exports during a period of acute economic
weakness in their country. The dollar closed at Y118.00 from a previous
Y117.50.
Prospects of an easing in German rates again helped to reduce tensions in
the exchange rate mechanism yesterday. The Spanish central bank again
intervened in the markets. The peseta closed at Pta71.69 against the D-Mark
from a previous close of Pta71.93.

<TEXT>
PWA, parent of Canadian Airlines International, yesterday unveiled a record
1992 loss of CDollars 543m (USDollars 433m), or CDollars 11.37 a share.
Last Friday Air Canada, its bigger rival, reported a final 1992 loss of
CDollars 454m, or CDollars 6.13 a share.
Together the country's two leading airlines lost almost CDollars 1bn in
1992, reflecting the long recession, overcapacity and vicious fare
discounting in the domestic market. Small charter airlines are the only ones
remaining profitable in Canada.
Both Air Canada and Canadian are struggling to complete ownership and
operating alliances with US-based international airlines but expect to
suffer more losses in 1993.
PWA's 1992 loss included a CDollars 333m special charge to cover the
expected costs of its proposed alliance with AMR, parent of American
Airlines, which is yet to be completed, and also staff severance and other
special items. Revenues were CDollars 2.88bn.
In 1991 PWA lost CDollars 161m or CDollars 3.66, including special items.
Its 1992 operating loss before special charges was CDollars 108.7m, against
a deficit of CDollars 112m in 1991.
Operating expenses were steady, but the gain in revenues was only 0.2 per
cent.

FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: Earnings doubled at Hollinger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and AGENCIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EARNINGS at Hollinger, the international publishing group controlled by Mr
Conrad Black, more than doubled last year, thanks to proceeds from the sale
of shares in the UK Telegraph group as well as improved operating results at
its main subsidiaries.
These gains more than offset losses early last year from the sale of a small
minority interest in United Newspapers.
Hollinger's earnings from continuing operations rose to CDollars 77m
(USDollars 61m), or CDollars 1.19 a share, from CDollars 32m, or 32 cents,
in 1991. Revenues climbed to CDollars 878m from CDollars 783m.
Tax provisions jumped to CDollars 47m from CDollars 24m, reflecting the end
of loss carryovers claimed by the 68 per cent-owned Telegraph group in the
UK.
Hollinger said operating results at all its leading subsidiaries improved
during the fourth quarter and were well ahead of budget.
Operating profits in the UK, consisting mainly of the Telegraph, rose to
CDollars 111.5m from CDollars 90m.
Equity earnings from John Fairfax, the Australian newspaper group in which
the Telegraph has a 15 per cent stake, climbed to CDollars 3m from CDollars
384,000. The Fairfax contribution has been adjusted to reflect Canadian
accounting principles.
Income from American Publishing, a group of more than 200 small US
newspapers, rose to CDollars 26.4m from CDollars 21.5m. In Canada, where the
company owns two chains of small newspapers, operating losses narrowed to
CDollars 2.5m from CDollars 3.6m.
Southam, meanwhile, Canada's biggest daily newspaper publisher in which
Hollinger earlier this year acquired a 22.6 per cent stake, reported a 1992
loss of CDollars 262.9m or CDollars 4.28 a share against a deficit of
Dollars 153.2m or Dollars 1.94 the previous year.
Fourth-quarter losses were CDollars 76.9m or CDollars 1.21 a share against
CDollars 114.3m or CDollars 1.94, agencies report from Toronto.
The group, however, would have broken even if unusual items totalling
CDollars 122.7m after tax and a provision of CDollars 140m related to
discontinued operations had been excluded. The fourth-quarter loss included
CDollars 90.9m in after-tax unusual items.
Southam also said it plans to issue at least CDollars 100m in equity shortly
to cut debt, and continue a programme of selling non-core or non-performing
assets.
Hollinger has proposed transferring half of its 22.6 per cent interest in
Southam to the Telegraph.

FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: Bridgestone turns in 10% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRIDGESTONE, the leading Japanese tyre maker, yesterday reported a 10.1 per
cent drop in pre-tax profits for the year to the end of December, largely a
reflection of the slump in Japanese vehicle production.
However, Sumitomo Rubber, one of its main competitors, reported a 2.3 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits on a slight increase in sales.
Bridgestone said pre-tax profits fell to Y68.9bn (Dollars 586m) from Y76.6bn
in the previous year on a 1.5 per cent drop in sales to Y725bn.
The company said its earnings were hit by the slump in domestic vehicle
sales and by the appreciation of the yen against the dollar, which depressed
the value of its US earnings.
Although the company has no concrete plans for restructuring, it will be led
by a new president from April who is expected to introduce significant
management changes.
Mr Yoichiro Kaizaki has spent most of his career in Bridgestone's
diversified and relatively decentralised chemical division. He has been
responsible for the rationalisation of Bridgestone's US operations at
Firestone, which it acquired in the late 1980s.
The company yesterday announced a sweeping change in its board, with the
promotion of four executives to report directly to Mr Kaizaki.
The Bridgestone group's consolidated worldwide sales were Y1,745bn, 1.1 per
cent down on 1991. Consolidated after-tax net earnings rose from Y7.4bn in
1991 to Y28.4bn last year.
Bridgestone/Firestone, the US subsidiary, is forecast to make a Dollars 10m
profit this year, against a loss of Dollars 132m last year.
Sumitomo Rubber attributed its profit increase to strong domestic sales of
new products and streamlining measures. Its pre-tax profits rose by 2.3 per
cent in the year to Y11.8bn.
Its sales rose by 2.3 per cent to Y260bn, largely as a result of higher
sales of high performance tyres.

FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: Repsol plans Dollars 1bn
worldwide share issue
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REPSOL, the Spanish state-controlled energy group, is to raise close to
Dollars 1bn in an international share issue following a surprise government
announcement yesterday authorising the conglomerate to double the amount of
shares it had originally intended to place on the market.
The placement, probably between mid-March and mid-April, is likely to be one
of the biggest international distributions of any share issue this year.
The decision to double the potential income from the placement appears to
underline an urgent need by the government to increase gains from the
disposal in order to reduce the budget deficit.
Lazards is advising in the share offer, and, in a move that reflected the
scale and complexity of the transaction, Repsol appointed Goldman Sachs as a
separate global co-ordinator of the issue earlier this month.
A government spokesman said Instituto Nacional de Hidrocarburos, INH, the
state holding that owns 54.5 per cent of Repsol, had been authorised to sell
up to 40m shares.
Such a share offering, if taken up, would raise Pta109bn (Dollars 931m) at
current market prices.
In January Repsol had indicated it would only be placing 7 per cent of INH's
equity in the market when it said it was seeking to raise Dollars 500m in a
circular to institutions that invited bids to lead the placement.
Dealers said they expected great demand for Repsol paper. Repsol's
sharesrose by Pta40 to Pta2,745 in Madrid yesterday.

CONTINENTAL, the German tyre maker, expects an 'extraordinarily difficult'
current financial year in Europe, only partly relieved by improving
conditions in north America.
However, there will be no dramatic effect on sales, deliveries or earnings,
the company said yesterday.
Last year had been satisfactory despite the weakening in the second half.
Deliveries of both car and commercial vehicle tyres rose 6 per cent, while
turnover, affected by currency fluctuations, rose only 3 per cent to DM9.7bn
(Dollars 5.9bn).
Without giving any profit details, the company said full-year results were
'clearly in the black' after a DM128m net loss in 1991. At the halfway mark
it reported profits of DM118m.

</HEADLINE>

   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Sweden's Saab Automobile deepened to SKr2.69bn (Dollars 343m) last
year as the car maker was hit by worsening market conditions worldwide and
heavy restructuring costs.
The worse-than-expected result is 20 per cent down on the 1991 deficit of
SKr2.24bn and follows a doubling of losses in the final three months of the
year when conditions in the car industry deteriorated sharply.
The group also took a one-off restructuring charge in the final quarter
following its decision to cut 2,000 jobs, more than 20 per cent of its
workforce, as part of a new rationalisation programme. It declined to
specify the size of the charge yesterday.
Saab, jointly owned by Saab-Scania and General Motors of the US, is
predicting a 'substantial improvement' in its 1993 figures but it still
expects to remain in the red. This would be its fifth consecutive year of
losses.
Revenues fell to SKr14.7bn from SKr15bn, as car sales slid to 86,800 from
87,500 in 1991.
The group's three main markets, Sweden, the US and the UK, were all
depressed although there were upturns in areas including Italy, Belgium,
Spain, Australia and Hong Kong.
In 1993, the group is hoping for a better result in both the US and UK,
although it expects the Swedish market to remain difficult and other markets
like Germany to be tough.
It believes its overall result will also be helped by its rationalisation
programme, which aims to cut costs by SKr2bn; the devaluation of the Swedish
krona, and the launch of a new car model.
Details of the new car have been kept under close wraps, although there is
no doubt that a success is needed to ensure the group's revival. The model
replacement for the 900 series- will be unveiled at the Frankfurt motor show
in September before going on sale in the autumn.
Partly because of the disruption which introduction of the new model will
cause, and partly because of a less intensive marketing drive, the company
is forecasting car sales of only 80,000 this year.
The group's new chief executive, Mr Keith Butler-Wheelhouse, has already
stated he would like to see the group's break-even production level reduced
to 70,000 units.
Last month, Saab's owners each promised to inject SKr1.4bn in new capital
during 1993 to help the group return to profit. They have already ploughed
in SKr5.5bn since mid-1991.

<TEXT>
FOUR European airlines - KLM, Swissair, Scandinavian Air System and Austrian
Airlines - said yesterday they were ready to launch detailed talks on the
feasibility of setting up a 'global airline system'.
The airlines, which disclosed in late January they were considering opening
formal talks, said they planned to examine how a possible partnership could
be structured and how long it might take to get off the ground.
They declined to give details or to say whether an equity link was likely,
but indicated that all options remained open. Joint working groups have been
set up to explore opportunities in more detail.
'A combined effort is essential to compete profitably with the current and
anticipated heavy pressure on the European airline business from strong
intercontinental airlines,' the four companies said in a joint statement.
The partnership would be based on several European hubs, enabling traffic to
be funnelled in and out of the airlines' home countries. The airlines said
their ambition was to offer a global route network for passengers and cargo
traffic.
The move forward into official negotiations comes exactly a year after the
breakdown of merger talks between KLM and British Airlines, which has gone
on to take a 25 per cent stake in Qantas of Australia and to pursue a
minority shareholding in USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier.
Since the collapse of the BA talks, KLM - which owns a minority stake in
Northwest of the US - has been searching for ways to boost its global and
its European presence.
Swissair, SAS and Austrian Airlines are already partners in a loose grouping
called the European Quality Alliance, which involves joint marketing
activities and flight time-tables.

FIRST American Bankshares, the BCCI-tainted Washington-based bank, has
agreed to sell virtually all of its remaining assets for Dollars 453m in
cash to First Union of North Carolina.
First Union will acquire all of the stock of First American Metro, the
holding company for First American Bank of Virginia, Maryland and Washington
DC.
The agreement comes about eight months after the Federal Reserve Board
ordered the Washington bank be sold after BCCI Holdings pleaded guilty to
illegally controlling First American.
Mr Harry Albright, court-appointed trustee of First American, said: 'Under
this agreement, First American's banking franchise in metropolitan
Washington will be sold intact to a strong banking institution which will
assume all of the deposit liabilities and acquire substantially all of First
American's remaining assets.'
First American Bank of Georgia is in liquidation and First American Miami
will be acquired by AmTrade International Bank of Georgia.
Mr John Georges, president of First Union said 'after so much uncertainty
and so much waiting, First American's future is secure'. First American
itself has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
At the end of 1992, First American Metro had total assets of Dollars 4.6bn
and deposits of Dollars 4bn. The acquisition will make First Union the
eighth biggest US banking group.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Dispirited publicans who are scraping the
barrel - Landlords frustrated over what they claim are unfair practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER McLoughlin has been landlord of the Golden Lion in Solihull for
eight years, working his way up from a manager for Courage, the brewer, to a
tenant.
He said he ran a 'pretty good pub' and never had financial problems - until
'the trouble' started.
In 1991 he switched from a tenancy to a lease with Inntrepreneur Estates,
the property joint venture between Grand Metropolitan and Courage. Under the
lease, his annual rent increased nearly 60 per cent from Pounds 52,000 to
Pounds 83,000. He knew the terms of the lease were demanding, but he
accepted them. 'It (the pub) isn't just my business, it's my home,' he said.
He now wishes he had refused. His barrelage has fallen from 800 to 550 a
year because of recession and his rent is equal to 24 per cent of turnover.
He is making a loss, owes Inntrepreneur Pounds 34,000 and now faces losing
the pub and the savings he invested in it.
Mr McLoughlin was one of 30 publicans who met on Thursday afternoon in
Hampstead. The mood was angry, but determined, and all those who spoke
claimed to be victims of unfair or aggressive practices by Inntrepreneur.
The meeting was arranged by the National Association of Inntrepreneur
Lessees (Nail), an informal body which claims its membership is growing
rapidly. It is difficult to know how many publicans are actively involved,
but NAIL's lawyer, Mr Julian Maitland-Walker of Charles Russell, said he is
acting for 80 Inntrepreneur tenants.
They intend to argue in court cases that the leases are invalid under EC
law. They also take issue in some instances with information given the
lessees on a pub's likely profitability.
GrandMet said it could not comment on its relations with licencees or the
operation of the Inntrepreneur leases because of the pending court cases.
Most of the complaints follow a similar pattern. Publicans claim they were
persuaded to sign leases at very high rentals. Once recession started to hit
business, the rentals became uneconomic. Inntrepreneur refused to arbitrate
and usually sent the bailiffs instead. There are also complaints about some
of Inntrepreneur's practices. For example, the company charges Pounds 100
unless leaseholders agree to pay by direct debit.
Sir Allen Sheppard, GrandMet's chairman, told the annual meeting this week
that unsuccessful leaseholders were 'generally individuals who have been
unable to sustain the level of turnover'.
Mr AG Cooper, a chartered surveyor at GW Cooper &amp; Co who is familiar with
many cases, said lessees were victims of falling beer volumes and recession.
'The rents they are paying cannot be afforded today in a very large number
of cases,' he said.
The standard Inntrepreneur lease appears fair. Rent reviews, which take
place every five years, can only be upward. But there is room for
arbitration and an independent valuer if the two sides cannot agree on the
increase.
However, rentals are based on historical levels of profitability so some
lessees' rentals do not reflect recession. Also, there are no provisions for
arbitration when Inntrepreneur frees a pub from tied beer supply and
increases the rent in compensation. Last October nearly 2,000 pubs were
freed in this way to comply with the government's beer orders. Mr Martin
Moore, licencee of the Bridge at Uckfield, was told his rent was being
increased from Pounds 24,000 to Pounds 29,100. He said an independent
valuation had put the rent at about half that amount.
The original attraction of the lease was that it gave lessees security of
tenure. In the late 1980s, when property prices were still rising and
competition to take over pubs was often fierce, leaseholders also had the
chance to share in a property's success by selling on, or assigning, the
lease.
For leaseholders now in trouble, there are few chances of assignment.
Capital values and annual turnovers have fallen, making Inntrepreneur's
rentals unattractive.
Some leaseholders also claim Inntrepreneur's actions have blocked planned
assignments. Mrs Pat Whybrow, of the Rose and Crown at Shorn, said she had
lined up a purchaser in 1990. But the assignment, which needed
Inntrepreneur's agreement, was called off after 'endless delays'.
In a 1991 interview with the Financial Times, Mr Bob Williams, GrandMet's
group property director, said Inntrepreneur was partly designed to create a
more entrepreneurial spirit among its publicans. 'There had been this
paternalism built up over centuries to tenants. Most were not businessmen,
they were failed professional footballers or retired coppers,' he said.
For people like Mr McLoughlin, who was neither a footballer nor a policeman,
Inntrepreneur's brave new world has come as a tremendous, and unpleasant,
shock. 'I was never a businessman. I was a publican,' he said.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Landlords' landlord calls time on
traditional relationship - A look at the problems facing the response of
GrandMet and Courage to the government's beer orders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE the annual meeting of Grand Metropolitan last Tuesday publicans were
protesting that the food and drinks group was charging 'excessive' rents on
its pub properties.
The alleged hardship and havoc that resulted were 'Killing Our National
Heritage: The Pub', one sign proclaimed.
Inside, Sir Allen Sheppard, chairman and chief executive, was giving
shareholders a more upbeat appraisal. The leases the company offered through
Inntrepreneur Estates, its joint venture with Courage, the brewer, were
helping to transform the pub trade into a more consumer-oriented business.
Only 'a very small minority' of Inntrepreneur's 4,700 leaseholders were
trading unsuccessfully. 'Rents are not imposed. They are agreed by both
parties.'
But for some licensees the economics are not working.
'Inntrepreneur wants Pounds 1,500 a week from me in rent and arrears, but my
weekly takings are only Pounds 1,000,' said Mrs June Varty, licensee of the
Gardeners Arms at Droylsden near Manchester.
The two sides have argued for several years over leases and rents but a
deepening recession in the pub trade has brought an extra edge to the
debate. Disgruntled publicans have formed the National Association of
Inntrepreneur Licensees to press their case with GrandMet and in the courts.
Nail's concern is not just the level of rents but some of the terms of the
20-year leases. Three years ago, Courage and GrandMet told the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission inquiry into the establishment of the Inntrepreneur
joint venture that the move from short tenancies to long leases was
inevitable.
The resulting MMC report said that the companies argued that 'twenty year
leases for public houses would develop whether or not the transaction went
ahead. They were appropriate in changing market conditions'.
The National Licensed Victuallers Association, however, expressed concern
about the leases to which GrandMet had begun to convert its own pub
tenancies in 1988.
The NLVA told the MMC that it accepted the principle of the leases. But it
complained that the terms of letting and the management tactics of GrandMet
had caused 'grief and heartache' to many erstwhile licensees.
'If pitfalls in the basic terms of the lease, such as high rents and
penalties for failing to achieve the minimum purchasing obligation, could be
rectified, the businesses could be run successfully,' the NLVA said. But it
'daily handled many examples of lessees facing financial ruin as a direct
result of these terms'.
The MMC ignored the licensees' pleas and Inntrepreneur was established with
its commercial plans to convert all the pub tenancies of its merged estate
to 20-year leases intact.
GrandMet devised the leases in anticipation of the 1989 MMC report on
competition in the brewing industry which persuaded the government to loosen
the grip of national brewers on pub retailing by forcing them to free a
third of their pubs from exclusive beer supplies.
The government orders sharpened the brewers' focus on their retailing
operations. In reshaping their estates, they were forced to evaluate the
potential profitability of every individual pub; to treat them like other
mainstream forms of commercial/retail property.
As GrandMet had foreseen, long-term assignable leases offered brewers the
best way of maximising profits from pubs in a more competitive environment.
In return for market rents and liability for repairs, the pub landlord could
be offered greater security and a chance to share in the capital
appreciation of the business.
Inntrepreneur, which was the first important response from the industry to
the government orders, set an example that has been followed by other
national brewers.
Bass, the UK's largest brewer, has converted more than 1,000 of its pub
tenancies to long-term leases. The Whitbread pub partnership scheme covers
2,300 of its licensees.
When Inntrepreneur began trading in 1991, GrandMet had converted 2,000 of
the 3,150 tenanted pubs it brought to the venture. Of the enlarged estate of
6,850 pubs, about 4,700 are now on long-term leases. The aim is to convert
the rest over the next 12 months.
Recession has added to the difficulties of the restructuring. Inntrepreneur
 -and its lessees - have been hit by falling property values and the squeeze
on consumer spending.
Rents agreed in the more buoyant market of a few years ago have been tougher
for licensees to meet as trading conditions have declined.
Pub beer sales fell by up to 5 per cent last year and the failure rate of
Inntrepreneur leaseholders rose. Some 9 per cent of them have gone out of
business in the past two years.
The value of Inntrepreneur's pub estate was estimated at Pounds 2.8bn when
the deal was first proposed in 1990. By the time it came to fruition a year
later, the slide in the property market had reduced that to Pounds 2.36bn.
Inntrepreneur has now sold 1,500 of its smaller outlets but has continued to
suffer from asset deflation. Further revaluations of the remaining property
last year cut its value by Pounds 234m, or 11 per cent, to less than Pounds
2bn. GrandMet charged its Pounds 117m share of the reduction against
reserves.
Inntrepreneur made a trading profit of Pounds 162m last year but after
interest payments of Pounds 203m recorded an operating loss of Pounds 28m.
Apart from sharing that loss, GrandMet and Courage each had to inject
another Pounds 32m to ensure it met its banking covenants.
With bank debt standing at Pounds 1.27bn, the company is unlikely to be able
to meet the covenants' conditions this year that debt should not exceed 57.5
per cent of assets.
A further revaluation of Inntrepreneur's pubs will be made in September. 'If
it is necessary to put in more money, then we shall do so,' Mr David Nash,
GrandMet's finance director, said this week.
Inntrepreneur's finances will be helped by recent reductions in interest
rates and industry analysts agree that at the trading level, the venture is
progressing satisfactorily. Most expect another small operating loss this
year but forecast it will break even or move into profit in 1994.
Once Inntrepreneur becomes profitable, few would be surprised if its owners
did not sell it or float it. Events this week have done little to change the
widespread view that the venture fits uncomfortably with GrandMet's
portfolio of international brands.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Platinum
and palladium in retreat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLATINUM and palladium markets were the falling stars of the world
commodities scene this week as growing concern about the prospects for
demand from Japanese car manufacturers turned last week's retreat into a
rout.
The preceding week had seen the platinum price surge by nearly Dollars 10 to
Dollars 370.50 a troy ounce while its sister metal, palladium, rose Dollars
4.10 to a 32-month high of Dollars 119 an ounce as Japanese buyers responded
to reports of sharply reduced Russian shipments to the US and Europe. That
rise was capped two weeks ago, however, when a Russian official insisted
that his country was still meeting all contracts to supply palladium to
world markets, and the ensuing downward reaction was fed last week by
nervousness about US economic policy.
Then came the Japanese car makers' 'body blow', as one analyst described it.
They told the Reuter news agency that, because their production was falling,
not only did they not need Russian platinum and palladium (for
anti-pollution exhaust catalysts), they might even sell some of their
present surplus. The manufacture of catalysts is estimated to account for
about 40 per cent of world platinum use and about 12 per cent of palladium
use.
That was enough to turn the enthusiastic Japanese buyers who had fuelled the
earlier strong advance into desperate sellers, and by yesterday afternoon
the platinum price was down Dollars 14.25 on the week at Dollars 345 an
ounce and palladium's down Dollars 8.85 at Dollars 100.15 an ounce. Some
dealers suggested that the markets had now become oversold, however, while
noting that sellers were also being discouraged by expectations that the yen
would not fall further against the US dollar - which would make platinum and
palladium prices appear relatively expensive to Japanese investors,
traditionally the main operators in these markets.
Gold got off relatively lightly until falling Dollars 1.90 yesterday to
Dollars 327.75 an ounce, down Dollars 2.50 on the week and near the bottom
of its recent narrow trading range.
Silver suffered its principal fall at the start of the week when nearby New
York Commodity Exchange (Comex) futures fell to life-of-contract lows and
the London bullion market price, which had fallen 7.5 cents last week, lost
another 4.5 cents at 358.5 cents an ounce. The London price then see-sawed
around that level, between 357.5 and 359.5 cents before ending yesterday at
359 cents an ounce.
The initial fall resulted from a wave of speculative selling, which traders
said was encouraged by news of a 2m-ounce rise in Comex warehouse stocks to
272m ounces.
Zinc was the main sufferer at the London Metal Exchange, where all base
metal contracts lost ground on the week. The three months delivery price
closed yesterday at a four-month low of Dollars 1,036.75 a tonne, down
Dollars 44.75 on the week after breaking through successive support areas.
In the absence of fresh developments dealers attributed the slide to the
long-running oversuply situation, which will be only partly relieved by
recently-announced production cuts. Zinc stocks in LME warehouses rose
another 8,000 tonnes to 554,600 tonnes.
Long-established support levels also gave way in the copper market as the
three months price slid Dollars 29.75 to Dollars 1,521.50 a tonne at
Thursday's close. Traders said modest Chinese buying had been brushed aside
as the price fell. Yesterday, however, three months copper rallied by
Dollars 17 to end only Dollars 12.75 down on the week.
Nickel pressed against downside support at Dollars 6,200 for three months
metal for three days before breaking through decisively on Thursday. After a
further fall yesterday the price closed at Dollars 6,085 a tonne, down
Dollars 202.50 on the week.
Tin prices continued the recent downtrend as the upward movement in LME
stocks accelerated - this week's rise amounted to 1,470 tonnes, taking the
total to 18,605 tonnes. The cash price closed yesterday at Dollars 5,770 a
tonne, down Dollars 30 on the week.
At the London Futures and Options Exchange cocoa prices were pushed towards
three-month highs early in the week as manufacturer demand absorbed selling
from the Ivory Coast, the biggest producer. Overhead resistance at Pounds
745 a tonne was broken down as the May position climbed to Pounds 760 a
tonne but it was back to Pounds 749 a tonne at yesterday's close. Dealers
blamed yesterdays Pounds 11 fall on speculative selling in New York. 'The
market is highly strung and jittery, but there is a good chance we'll see
consolidation in the short term,' one told Reuter. 'The bull move is working
sideways at the moment.'
World sugar prices built on last week's strength as operators continued to
react to reductions in analysts' assessments of the likely level of the
1992-93 production surplus. At the New York Cocoa, Sugar and Coffee Exchange
the May futures price put on more than half a cent over the week to touch
the psychologically-important 10 cents-a-lb level yesterday. But dealers
thought the market had become overbought and prices were trimmed in later
trading.
The market had been watching the International Cocoa Organisation talks in
London, aimed at negotiating a price-stabilisation pact to replace the
moribund International Cocoas Agreement, which expires in September. But
there was little reaction yesterday to news that delegates had failed to
reach a compromise on the price range to be defended by a stock withholding
operation and had adjourned the meeting till Monday.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Severn Trent to pay Pounds 33m for East
Worcester Water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVERN TRENT, the Midlands water and sewerage group, is buying East
Worcester Water, a small supplier, for Pounds 33.1m.
East Worcester is the latest in a string of acquisitions this year by the
'big 10' water and sewerage companies privatised in 1989, but the first of
the 22 small water companies to be purchased by one of the 10.
The deal has been cleared by Ofwat, the water industry regulator, after
assurances that a high proportion of the prospective savings would be passed
on directly to customers.
Ofwat said it expected to see East Worcester's former customers gain an
average of Pounds 18 each over the next two years as their prices come into
line with those of Severn Trent.
Mr John Bellak, Severn Trent chairman, said the arrangement had 'strong
commercial logic. The activities of East Worcester are well known to Severn
Trent and the two companies have a long history of working together'.
East Worcester's 100,000 customers, all south of Birmingham, are among the
3.3m receiving sewerage services from Severn Trent.
East Worcester is owned by Biwater, the water engineering group which also
owns Bournemouth and West Hampshire Water companies. Its 1992 results,
released earlier this week, showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds 3.88m on a
turnover of Pounds 13.7m.
Mr Alan Booker, Ofwat's deputy director general, said Severn Trent's
customers would benefit from greater security of supply and East Worcester's
from lower prices.
He cited the 1990 Three Valleys merger, cleared by the government after a
reference to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, as a precedent.
The 'big 10' are the sole providers of sewerage services, and supply water
to more than three quarters of households in England and Wales.
Of the 22 small suppliers, almost half have been acquired in recent years by
three French companies - Compagnie General des Eaux, Lyonnaise des
Eaux-Dumez and SAUR. Eight have shares listed on the Stock Exchange.
Mr Bill Dale, water industry analyst at Warburg Securities, said Severn
Trent's move was unlikely to lead to a rush of bids by the 'big 10' for the
smaller companies. 'Looking around the regions, there are not any other
immediate candidates.'
In December Severn Trent reported interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 141m,
with an interim dividend of 7p out of earnings of 37.5p a share. It was
criticised by Ofwat for 'erring too much in favour of shareholders and too
little on the side of the customer.'
In response, Mr Bellak pointed to Pounds 585m of investment in the previous
financial year and an understanding that dividend growth was 'above
inflation.'
Severn Trent is the seventh of the 'big 10' to make a sizeable acquisition
this year. Earlier this week Welsh Water paid Pounds 56m for Acer, the
engineering consultant group.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Owners focuses on Cook tie-up - Total
dividend for 1993 expected to be raised by 43% to 5p
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OWNERS ABROAD yesterday increased its estimate of benefits that should arise
from its proposed tie-up with Thomas Cook, the travel and financial services
group and said it expected to recommend a 5p total dividend for the year to
October 1993, a 43 per cent increase over last year.
In the last defence document in which it can introduce new financial
information, Owners Abroad said the revised figures further demonstrated
that the Pounds 225m bid from rival holiday group, Airtours, understated its
value and potential.
The company said the benefits of the tie-up with Thomas Cook, which is
controlled by Westdeutsche Landesbank, the German state bank, had risen from
its original estimate of at least Pounds 7m to at least Pounds 9m for
1993-94. Estimates for the following year had been raised from Pounds 8m to
Pounds 11m.
Mr Howard Klein, Owners' chairman, said that if the Airtours bid succeeded,
an enlarged group would have to make savings of Pounds 22.3m in the first
full year after acquisition and Pounds 27.3m in the following year if Owners
shareholders were to enjoy equivalent benefits to those that would flow from
the Thomas Cook tie-up.
This was based on the fact that Owners shareholders would end up with only
40 per cent of the enlarged group if they accepted the Airtours share
offers.
City observers said that by turning the focus of debate to the future and
what Owners shareholders could expect from Thomas Cook, Owners Abroad had
produced its most robust argument yet.
Mr David Crossland, Airtours' chairman, said Owners had been selective with
its figures when the facts showed that the rate of Owners Abroad's
improvement in trading over the past year was actually slowing down.
Owners Abroad's revised estimates of benefits have been verified by its
auditors, BDO Binder Hamlyn, and advisers, Samuel Montagu. The increased
estimates followed 'a better understanding of the retail arrangement (with
Thomas Cook),' said Mr Geoffrey Stone, finance director.
Mr Klein said these arrangements would benefit Owners at no extra cost.
Thomas Cook would be marketing Owners Abroad's Enterprise brand standard
family summer holidays in a brochure that carried the Thomas Cook name.
Thomas Cook had a similar one year deal with Sun World, and estimated from
that experience that it could deliver Owners Abroad with 80,000 additional
passengers on this product in the first year.
There was already a similar marketing of Owners' up-market Sovereign
brochure and its flight-only Falcon brochure, which was being wrapped with
the Thomas Cook name; and Owners would also market Thomas Cook's high cost,
high margin, Faraway Collection holidays with a Sovereign wrap.
Mr Klein said the increased estimates for the benefits of the tie-up were
based on the assumption that 40 per cent of the passengers promised by
Thomas Cook would have switched from Owners' holidays and could not,
therefore, be counted as new business.
In the year to end-September 1993, Airtours will, however, have the help of
acquisition accounting. Airtours could provide for the losses on Owners
Abroad's winter operations, writing them off against the balance sheet, but
could take all Owners Abroad's summer profits to the enlarged profit and
loss account.
This would dramatically enhance earnings per share because of the highly
seasonal nature of profits in the holiday business; Owners Abroad made a
Pounds 26m loss in its 1991-92 winter, but profits of Pounds 56m in the
second half.
If the bid succeeded, Mr Klein said; 'this year could be a fantastic year
(for Airtours) but watch out for next year' when the winter losses would
depress 1994 profits.
Mr Crossland said no shareholders would be looking at an enlarged group's
eps this year. What mattered was the year ending September 1994, when
Airtours would have chosen the brochures and decided the pricing and would
have had a full year with Owners Abroad.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Scottish &amp; Newcastle links with Mansfield
to boost lager sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH &amp; Newcastle, the brewing and leisure group, yesterday announced a
commercial partnership with Mansfield, the east Midland brewer.
Under the agreement, Mansfield will stop brewing Marksman draught lager and
instead supply its 426 pubs with S&amp;N's McEwans.
In return, the Edinburgh-based group is selling 11 pubs to Mansfield for
Pounds 2.2m and will stock the brewer's cask conditioned beers in some of
its 1,871 outlets.
Mansfield shares rose 17p to 702p on the news. Scottish &amp; Newcastle closed
up 1p at 438p.
Mr Jim Merrington, corporate affairs director at S&amp;N, said the deal would
offer new outlets for McEwans while Mansfield, which has been seeking
acquisitions outside its core Midlands region, would gain new pubs in
Lincolnshire and Yorkshire.
Although he declined to reveal the details of the financial agreement, Mr
Merrington said: 'The Pounds 2.2m is the value of the pubs and does not
represent a payment to S&amp;N'
Industry analysts said the Midlands brewery is likely to have been offered
an S&amp;N loan to buy the pubs and predicted the group would recoup the outlay
through additional volume sales of McEwans.
S&amp;N expects to sell an extra 30,000 barrels a year through Mansfield outlets
at a profit of up to Pounds 20 a barrel.
Mr Colin Stump, commercial and marketing director at Mansfield, said: 'We do
have a finance agreement with S&amp;N to help us find the Pounds 2.2m which is
on favourable terms. Our strategy is one of continual growth and we're very
much on the acquisition trail.' Further big purchases would be financed
through borrowing, he added.
This latest acquisition follows a large expansion last year when Mansfield
bought 115 pubs from Courage.
Analysts, however, said the agreement was less significant for Mansfield
than S&amp;N, which hopes to use an increasing number of regional outlets to
boost lager sales and challenge Britain's top-selling brands.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Gabicci in discussions with a possible
buyer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GABICCI, the USM-quoted casual clothing group, yesterday admitted it is in
talks with a possible buyer after speculation about a bid caused a
fluctuation in its share price this month.
The group also warned that its interim results for the six months to
December 19 1992 were likely to fall short of expectations.
Gabicci's share price fell to a little above 20p earlier this month from a
plateau of about 45p at the end of last year. They closed at 47p yesterday.
Rival clothing companies, Helene and Campari International, are seen as
potential bidders.
Campari sells to a younger market than Gabicci, but a merger would allow for
rationalisations in design, sourcing and distribution since the two groups
are virtually neighbours in North London, one analyst said.
However, he added, although Campari is cash rich, the group was likely
shortly to announce profits down by about 35 per cent and might lack
institutional support for acquisitions.
Gabicci was in talks with Helene last year but discussions collapsed in
November.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Strong second half helps Mallett to Pounds
0.52m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MALLETT, the antique dealer, saw pre-tax profits halve from Pounds 1.12m to
Pounds 519,000 in the year to December 31, though this disguised a strong
second-half performance. And last year's figure included an exceptional
credit of Pounds 660,000.
The company recently broke off merger talks with an unnamed company, thought
to be Asprey, the silver, jewellery and luxury goods company,
Having incurred pre-tax losses of Pounds 485,000 in the first six months,
the company made profits of Pounds 1.11m before exceptional items in the
second half. Mr Peter Dixon, company secretary, ascribed the turnround to
the global improvement in the art market in general, sterling leaving the
ERM and its devaluation.
Turnover slipped to Pounds 8.17m (Pounds 8.39m), though operating profits
climbed to Pounds 802,000 (Pounds 537,000). Interest payable doubled to
Pounds 176,000 (Pounds 84,000).
The exceptional charge of Pounds 108,000 related to the relocation of all
Christopher Wood Gallery activities into the New Bond Street premises.
Earnings fell to 2.52p (5.96p) per share and after the passing of the
interim a final dividend of 2p is recommended. Last year's total was 4.5p.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Isosceles may settle refinancing next month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the parent of the Gateway food retail chain, put its business
plan to its 38 banks yesterday morning and now hopes it can finalise its
Pounds 1.4bn refinancing next month.
This would be well before May 28, the expiry date of the standstill agreed
with the banks before Christmas.
The meeting is believed to have been positive. Since Mr David Simons became
chief executive on January 4 he has apparently impressed the banks that he
is getting a grip of a business which had suffered several top management
changes.
The business plan, which won approval from OC&amp;C, the management consultants,
will form the basis of the refinancing, with the group's balance sheet being
tailored to its ability to service debt.
The refinancing is expected to involve a debt for equity swap, although not
as large as earlier estimates, in part thanks to the fall in interest rates.
Equity holders will be severely diluted.
Mr Simons has rapidly simplified the structure of Gateway. He has also put
the development of new retail formats on hold while making a priority of
ensuring the shops are properly stocked, tidy and have chiller cabinets that
work. Development of computer systems is also a priority.
Suppliers to Gateway had precipitated the pre-Christmas standstill as they
became nervous about Gateway's credit standing. The standstill agreement
allayed those fears, and Gateway is understood not to have had to draw on an
extra working capital facility provided at that time.
However, there is a fear that suppliers could again become concerned as the
May 28 deadline approaches and this is putting pressure on the group and its
banks to reach an early agreement.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Administrators put Platt Saco up for sale
as recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLATT SACO Lowell (UK), one of the UK's biggest remaining textile machinery
manufacturers, has been put up for sale by administrators from KPMG Peat
Marwick.
The company emerged in 1982 from the controversial receivership of
Stone-Platt Industries with new owners, the oddly-named South Carolina
company John D. Hollingsworth on Wheels.
However, it has been hit recently by a worldwide slump in orders for its
cotton processing equipment.
Earlier this month directors asked a court to put the business into
administration, giving protection against creditors while allowing time for
attempts to be made to sell it or turn it round.
Mr Mike Seery and Mr Peter Terry from KPMG, appointed joint administrators,
are trying to sell Platt as a going concern.
Platt had turnover of Pounds 10m last year.
Its present workforce, following eight redundancies in the administrative
staff, is 260.
KPMG said yesterday that Platt had state-of-the-art manufacturing
technology, and had an international reputation for its spinning and fibre
preparation equipment.

<TEXT>
ISOTRON, the Swindon-based food irradiation company, reported advances in
interim profits and turnover.
Pre-tax profits for the six months ended December 31 were 13 per cent up at
Pounds 1.44m, against Pounds 1.28m on turnover 10 per cent ahead at Pounds
3.45m (Pounds 3.14m).
Earnings per share were 7.8p (6.9p) and the interim dividend has been raised
to 1.51p (1.37p).
Mr Colin Clive, chairman, said turnover in medical sterilisation was close
to plan and ahead of last year, while business in the chemical sector was
better than expected.
Capital spending was low, and the company's cash position improved by Pounds
1.1m to Pounds 4.89m over the six months.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Write-downs expected to hit Ladbroke
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ladbroke Group's 1992 pre-tax profits, due out on Thursday, are expected to
show a substantial fall following the first above-the-line write-down of its
Pounds 1bn property portfolio.
The write-down is estimated at 15 per cent, or roughly Pounds 150m. Previous
provisions have eroded balance sheet reserves, causing the latest cuts in
valuations to be taken as a charge against profits.
Before property provisions, profit is forecast to fall from Pounds 210m to
less than Pounds 190m.
The provisions do not represent an outflow of cash. When Mr Cyril Stein,
chairman, was asked about the prospect of a property write-down last
September, he commented that if one were made, it would only be 'a book
entry'.
It would not affect the final dividend, which the board was planning to hold
at 6.23p, making a total of 11.15p.
The figures are expected to include gains of about Pounds 40m from hotel
sales - a profit source vulnerable to the new FRS 3 accounting rule.
While Ladbroke's Hilton International hotel chain continued to experience
difficult markets last year, analysts are hoping to hear that the pound's
devaluation has brought signs of life to London hotels. On the other hand,
Texas Homecare, the DIY chain which was the star performer in 1991, is
thought to have suffered a downturn since black Wednesday.

FT  27 FEB 93 / UK Company News: Sphere proposes creation of new packaged
share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPHERE Investment Trust, a split capital trust, has revealed proposal to
create a new packaged share, combining the current income and zero dividend
preference shares.
The move reflects concern at the trust that its investment performance was
being obscured by the volatile nature of the different classes of capital.
Split capital trusts are designed to maximise demand by creating securities
that have tax advantages for different classes of investors. In recent
years, there has been an explosion of split issues, particularly linked to
Personal Equity Plans, where income and profits are tax-free.
Some critics feel, however, that such structures can be complex and risky
and may result in confusion among small investors. The Sphere change is
designed to create a security with similar characteristics to those of
ordinary shares in a conventional investment trust.
The Package unit will comprise 8 ordinary income and 7 zero dividend shares.
It should be less volatile than either of the existing classes of share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pre-tax losses at SEET, the Edinburgh-based textile company, were reduced to
Pounds 65,000 in the six months to October 31. That compared with a deficit
of Pounds 455,000 for the comparable period and with a loss of Pounds
630,000 for the year to April 30.
Sales for the half year increased by 39 per cent, from Pounds 3.27m to
Pounds 4.54m, and the group was able to reduce borrowings by more than half
with the Pounds 1.26m proceeds from the sale of Kenneth Mackenzie Holdings.
Losses per share were cut to 3.2p (10.5p).

<TEXT>
de Morgan Group, an adviser on all aspects of commercial, industrial and
retail property, achieved a reduction in pre-tax losses from Pounds 814,000
to Pounds 131,000 for the six months ended October 31.
The improved results reflected in part higher turnover of Pounds 987,000
(Pounds 753,000) and further significant cost savings. Operating costs were
cut to Pounds 1.1m (Pounds 1.57m).
Tax credits of Pounds 5,000 (Pounds 280,000) left basic losses per share at
0.27p (1.15p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reduced pre-tax losses of Pounds 57,500 were announced by Greenwich
Communications, the USM-quoted television services and property rental
group, for the year to August 31 1992. Previous losses amounted to Pounds
768,200.
Mr Alfred Stirling, the chairman, said that, as indicated last year, the
company's revenue sources had been reduced to two - Tex House rental income,
still not fully let due to the glut of property on the market in the
Woolwich area, and Greenwich Satellite Portugal, the 80 per cent owned
Portuguese subsidiary which had produced a pre-tax profit of Pounds 32,000
(Pounds 21,000 losses).
Turnover improved from Pounds 288,700 to Pounds 421,700 and there were
exceptional losses of Pounds 99,800 (Pounds 524,200).
Losses per share were cut from 10.9p to 0.9p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALEXANDERS Holdings, the Ford main dealer, reported a pre-tax deficit Pounds
998,000 for the year ended September 30 1992.
That compared with a restated profit of Pounds 405,000 for 1991 and came
from turnover up from Pounds 85.4m to Pounds 89m. Losses per share came out
at 2.15p (0.65p earnings). The balance sheet shows a deterioration of net
assets from Pounds 8m to Pounds 6.74m.
As a result of an investigation instigated by Mrs Aleksandra Clayton, the
chairman, prior year adjustments have been made to the profit and loss
account amounting to Pounds 1.57m, of which Pounds 1.35m relates to 1990. A
further loss has to be borne in the 1992 accounts on surplus and over-age
used vehicle stock.
A charge of Pounds 639,000 has been made to the profit and loss account and
to the revaluation reserves relating to the properties at Greenock. This was
offset by a profit of Pounds 98,000 on the sale of two of the properties.
A revaluation of the other properties in the group as at end-September 1992
has led to a drop of Pounds 1.06m from their 1988 value.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Ructions in the ancien regime: Disorder on the streets has
spread to French politics, injecting uncertainty into the election campaign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is ironic that France, which fields more troops than any other country to
help the United Nations try to prevent a new world disorder breaking out,
should often be so unruly at home.
This week has seen fishermen smashing up markets in their native Brittany
and in Paris in protest at cheap imports. It was the first time that the men
of the sea decided to use the same licence for violent demonstration that
French society has long given its men of the land. The farmers, too,
disrupted trains in their continuing campaign against farm reform negotiated
in the European Community and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Some dockers, airline and electronics workers also stopped work in pay and
lay-off protests.
Disorder of a different kind broke out in French politics. Mr Michel Rocard,
former prime minister, used his position as the Socialists' intended
successor to President Francois Mitterrand in two years to call for 'a
political big bang' to create a new universe on the French left. Conceding
the implosion of the ruling Socialist party in the run-up to next month's
parliamentary elections, Mr Rocard called on Socialists to abandon their
party and to join with pragmatic Greens, moderate Centrists and reformist
Communists in a new movement.
The shock waves of this initiative are still radiating through French
politics. A note of uncertainty has now been injected into an election
campaign which had seemed sure to result in an overwhelming victory for the
centre-right. Clearly, Mr Rocard sees his 'big bang' as the only thing that
can propel him into the Elysee in 1995, but there is just an outside chance
that it could give France the sort of broad-based, durable social democratic
party that most other European countries have.
These ructions stem, in part, from the fact that France has modernised its
economy - or the industrial part of it - faster than its society or its
politics. But they also reflect an unhappiness about the way that industrial
modernisation has taken place.
In statistical terms, its industrial success is clear. France recorded a
FFr30bn (Pounds 3.8bn) trade surplus last year, a performance made all the
more impressive by the country's strong exchange rate. This surplus is now
fading away under the impact of competitive devaluations, plus falling
demand, in many neighbouring countries. But France will keep its position as
the world's fourth largest exporter. Its unit wage costs have risen 12 per
cent less than rival Germany's over the past four years.
All this has been achieved within the liberal economic rules that the EC and
world economic competition have imposed on France. Brussels's competition
directorate has gradually reined in French state aid to industry, which has
been equally constrained by the Maastricht treaty's budgetary disciplines.
Industrial imports have a higher penetration (31 per cent) in France than in
trade-deficit Britain (29.2 per cent), according to the Commissariat du
Plan, the French planning agency. They include ever-larger quantities of
Japanese cars, to the continuing fulmination of Mr Jacques Calvet, head of
Peugeot.
But just because the French have played the game well does not mean that
most of them like the rules any better. One of the few popular things the
Socialist government has done in its waning weeks of power has been to make
it harder for employers to throw more people on the heap of nearly 3m
jobless. The Patronat employers federation has become the butt of criticism
from the right as well as the left.
An even better scapegoat has been foreign companies like Hoover, Philips,
Grundig and Kimberly-Clark, which have been pulling out of France. Behind
the charge of 'social dumping' - widely levelled at foreign companies, but
only with any plausibility at Hoover - is the feeling that France must
resist an alien, uncaring model of society being thrust on it.
Nowhere, of course, is such resistance greater than in agriculture. France
remains flatly opposed to last year's EC-US deal on cutting back subsidised
farm exports. Paris says it wants the whole Gatt negotiations restarted, an
idea to which President Clinton's combative behaviour on Airbus and other
trade issues gives a faint plausibility.
UK Prime Minister John Major tried to play peacemaker at the White House
this week. But there is a tendency here these days also to see Britain as
part of a general effort to do down France and its achievements. Even the
cosmopolitan Mr Raymond Barre, the centrist politician, has warned publicly
of an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy to sell the franc short. A senior government
official dismisses as nonsense such a charge which arises, he believes, out
of the linguistic fact that 'the markets tend to speak to us in English'.
France's current xenophobic bout seems to be socio-economic rather than
racist. The national human rights commission this week reported a further
decline in racist violence last year, a welcome contrast to - and perhaps a
lesson drawn from - what has been happening in Germany.
Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, who last year clamoured against Maastricht and was
inviting his supporters to slap in the face every journalist they met, has
had a quiet campaign. His National Front has been squeezed by the strong
showing of the RPR and UDF opposition parties, who themselves have called
for a 'clear and courageous immigration policy'. They want to give
foreigners less time to argue against expulsion orders, and less scope for
those wishing to gain entry into France to make marriages of convenience and
for polygamists to collect multiple family allowances.
But the phenomenon that spawned the National Front on the right and the
Greens on the left still exists. This is the mixture of contempt and apathy
in which many French hold mainstream politicians, who in some opinion polls
rate only just above prostitutes.
Corruption may not be on the Italian level. But one insider trading scandal,
concerning Pechiney's 1988 purchase of Triangle, a US packaging company,
still rumbles on to haunt the Socialists. In modernising the Paris
marketplace, Socialists opened it and themselves to the temptations inherent
in big financial transactions. Senior Socialists, as well as opposition
politicians, have been indicted for putting corporate kickbacks into the
party coffers. The presence in the government of Mr Bernard Tapie, seen as
an asset-juggler rather than a conventional businessmen, has not helped.
In the country that gave the world the categories of 'left' and 'right' in
politics, many people, according to opinion polls, feel this dividing line
to be of decreasing relevance.
This week Mr Rocard claimed the demarcation was still relevant - but 'in the
wrong place'. His strategy is to move socialists with a small 's' away from
outmoded concepts like class warfare towards the political centre, while at
the same time wooing back the founders of Generation Ecologique, the more
pragmatic environmentalists who had earlier bolted from the Socialist party.
Mr Brice Lalonde, GE's leader, said he might do business with Mr Rocard,
though not necessarily the Socialist party - accepting 'the bang, but not
the gang', as he put it.
Even if Mr Rocard's initiative never takes the concrete form of a new party
or a new federation of parties, it is part of the necessary fluidity of
French politics. All presidential aspirants need to reach outside their own
party to assemble temporary coalitions that can carry them to the Elysee,
the seat of real power.
Mr Mitterrand has set in train a constitutional review to modernise the
Fifth Republic. But his first step was timid. An experts' committee this
month recommended tinkering with the balance between institutions. Until
France gives less power to its secretive, quasi-monarchical presidency and
more to its feeble, but open, National Assembly, its citizenry will do the
old-fashioned thing of taking their grievances on to the streets.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Surfing across the screen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Broadcasters around the world are starting to take notice when two rather
technical words are mentioned - 'digital compression'. They refer to
techniques dating from the 1970s by which the 400,000 or so individual
elements in a single frame of a television picture are turned into digital
form and broadcast to the viewer. What will soon be on offer is nothing less
than an entertainment revolution.
British viewers who have scarcely had time to get used to the 20 or 30
channels now available on cable and satellite, in place of the conventional
handful of national broadcasting choices, may soon have to start
contemplating the possibility of several hundred television channels coming
into their homes from all over the world.
Experts at this week's Financial Times Cable and Satellite conference seemed
in agreement that 180-channel systems using digital technology are now no
more than two years away.
The changes about to hit the small screen are so significant that new words
are being coined to cope with the concepts: for example, 'grazing', the term
used to cover the behaviour of viewers dipping into and sampling a wide
range of channels, is giving way to 'surfing' a word describing the likely
behaviour of viewers skimming gracefully over the surface of an endless
choice. To Goldman Sachs, the US merchant bank, the merging of sound,
pictures and computers in digital form is creating a new 'Communicopia'.
No one can forecast precisely how many channels will prove to be
commercially viable. But Mr Celso Azevedo, technical director of Societe
Europeenne des Satellites, the Luxembourg-based company which runs the Astra
satellite system, promised at the conference that the option of 180 channels
would be available by 1995.
Another satellite with a further 180 channels was being considered by Astra,
he said.
Using digital compression, 10 channels could be squeezed into the space now
occupied by one, said Mr Azevedo. Microchip technology makes this possible.
With pictures arriving on the screen at the rate of 25 a second, each frame
is not very different from its predecessor. An individual frame is held in
the microchip memory and only the differences between one frame and the next
are identified and transmitted. This means a huge saving in channel
capacity.
However, there is a trade-off between the number of channels and the quality
of the picture: if viewers want higher-quality pictures, or wide-screen
television, it will mean fewer channels.
Digital compression is not just being considered in Europe. In Asia, the
Hong Kong-based Star Television satellite company currently broadcasts five
channels of television, including BBC World Service Television, to 38 Asian
countries. It is considering moving to 180 channels by 1995. In the US,
Hughes Communications plans to launch a 150-channel system next year using
digital compression.
But why should anyone want 180 or even 360 channels? The driving force is
coming from movies on demand. Pay Dollars 5 and see a hit movie now - or
almost now. Compression will dramatically cut the cost of satellite
transmission and make it possible to devote six channels to showing the same
film. Because of staggered starts, viewers will rarely be more than 20
minutes away from watching the film of their choice.
With more than 15 years' experience of pay-per-view movies on conventional
cable systems, Mr Edward Bleier, a senior Time Warner executive, can offer
straightforward advice on how to make the business a success.
'Concentrate on the hits. Like theatres, video stores, airline terminal book
racks, almost all the business is in the hits,' said Mr Bleier.
The new pay-per-view for 'hit' movies, which could over the longer term
undermine the video store, will help to bankroll a wide range of low-cost
existing entertainment channels from the US, and programmes for ethnic
minorities or special interest groups.
At the moment it costs about Pounds 4m to lease a satellite transponder
which receives a single channel from earth and beams it back again. Divide
that channel distribution cost by 10 and suddenly a lot of things become
possible.
Already, there is no shortage of people interested in using digital
compression to provide happy surfing in a new Communicopia.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Digital killed the audio star: High-quality broadcasts
promise to transform the way we consume music and television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In 1983, Virgin group founder Mr Richard Branson showed a record magazine an
electronic box which could receive music from satellites and transfer it to
people's stereo systems.
The box was an April Fool's hoax. To Mr Branson's delight, the magazine fell
for it, running the story on its front page.
Ten years later, no one is laughing. Households in the US can already pay to
have compact disc-quality music broadcast to their homes. Using newly
available digital recording machines, they can make copies as clear as
anything they can buy from their local record shop.
Some in the music industry believe that, as such services become more widely
available, the compact disc, the cassette - even the record shop itself -
could disappear.
In their place would be a home juke box, from which people could select
CD-quality albums or single tracks, and record them whenever they wished.
Some go further: with music available on request and at the touch of a
button, people will not even bother to record it.
Similarly, instead of going to the video store to rent a film or waiting for
a movie to appear on television, cable subscribers could order whatever film
they wanted and it would immediately appear on their screens.
Mr Alain Levy, chief executive of PolyGram, one of the world's biggest music
groups, doubts that music lovers will stop buying compact discs and
cassettes in great numbers. 'The technology will exist, but my gut feeling
is that changes in people's behaviour take a lot longer.'
Similarly, Blockbuster, the Florida-based video rental company which now
owns the Cityvision chain in the UK, argues that the delivery of movies
directly to the home will not ruin its business. 'The threat to home video
is overstated. We think it will be viable through to the end of the decade,'
claims Mr Ron Castell, senior vice-president of programming and
communications.
But Mr Nic Garnett, director general of the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry, which represents music companies worldwide, believes
it is safer to proceed on the assumption that delivery of entertainment
directly to the home will catch on.
He has already begun campaigning for legislation to ensure that record
companies' revenues are protected and that people who receive their music at
home are made to pay for it. He wants music companies to be given the right
to authorise or refuse the broadcast of their recording to people's homes.
'In most cases, permission will be granted - but on terms,' he says.
In the US, a company called Digital Music Express (DMX) already provides 30
channels of CD-quality music 24 hours a day to 10m cable subscribers. For
between Dollars 10 and Dollars 12 a month, which includes a tuner and a
remote control device, subscribers can listen to anything from chamber music
to a reggae channel.
The music is not interrupted by commercials or disc jockeys. While the
selected channel is playing, the remote control device displays the name of
the track, the artist, the album title, the composer, the record label and,
where applicable, the position in the charts.
Next month, DMX says it will start broadcasting to cable subscribers in the
UK, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Programmes will be transmitted by
satellite from Atlanta to European cable operators.
If subscribers want a high-quality recording of the music they are listening
to, they can use one of two new products, the Digital Compact Cassette or
the Mini Disc. The DCC looks similar to a cassette tape, but produces a
sound as good as a compact disc. The Mini Disc is a smaller version of the
CD, but it can record as well as play music. The recordable, blank CD is not
yet commercially available, but it is technically feasible and many expect
it to be on sale eventually.
The next development is likely to be digital audio broadcasting, which will
allow radio stations to broadcast high-quality, interference-free sound from
terrestrial transmitters to purchasers of special receivers.
Mr Henry Price, head of engineering information at the BBC, says he expects
digital audio broadcasting to begin in Germany in the second half of 1995,
and in the UK shortly after that. In theory, listeners could then make
digital recordings of rock songs or concerts, but Mr Price wonders how many
will.
The UK already has the digital Nicam television sound system, enabling
people to record CD-quality music. Even analogue radio transmissions can
provide an acceptable level of sound for decent recording. But there is not
much evidence of widespread recording from radio or television.
Even with DMX, there is the disadvantage that you cannot record what you
want when you want it. The 30 channels have a daily programme of music and,
while subscribers can select one, they cannot choose an album or track.
Similarly, while television watchers can make a video recording of a film on
a networked or subscription channel, if they want a particular title they
have to wait until it appears on the schedule - or rent it from a video
shop.
If current methods of buying music or renting videos are to be replaced,
subscribers will have to be able to choose the recording or film they want
when they want it.
Time Warner, the US media group, is already promising cable subscribers the
right to choose, with the announcement last month of an 'electronic
superhighway'. The group, the second largest cable company in the US, will
use digital storage and compression technology (see inset) to offer
subscribers a wide range of movies on demand. The 'electronic superhighway'
will start on an experimental basis in Orlando, Florida, in early 1994.
Time Warner says it has no plans to offer music on demand, but Mr Michael
Tyler, a partner with consultants Booz Allen &amp; Hamilton, says the technology
can be used to do so.
The Virgin group, which owns 70 music and entertainment mega-stores
worldwide, says it does not believe these trends will put it out of
business. Mr Will Whitehorn, the group's spokesman, says that, while smaller
record shops might suffer, large outlets can adjust by selling other
products. With music sales slowing, Virgin's stores are devoting more space
to computer games. Products which the company believes could become more
important include laser discs. 'There's always going to be some sort of
software that people want to collect,' he says.
Virgin sees no reason to alter its plans to have 200 megastores by 1996.
People like a CD or cassette box and the pictures and information that go
with them, Mr Whitehorn says. He argues that there will always be people who
like browsing in music stores.
Blockbuster, which last year announced a joint venture with Virgin to build
music megastores in the US and continental Europe, does see ways in which
electronic delivery can, in the meantime, help retailers.
It is currently experimenting with a system called 'Soundsational', which
could deliver high-quality copies of an album - in cassette or compact-disc
form - from a computerised centre to an individual record store in a matter
of minutes. Soundsational's advantage is that it could significantly curtail
the store's stock of older or less popular records. Mr Castell says the
company hopes to test the system within the next 12 months.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: Extension of council tax bandings would be more in
touch with reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KENNETH HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have recently written to my MP concerning the adoption of the council
tax, which I see as a reversion to the old rating system, but under a
redesigned label. In my view, this tax is flawed at the top of the scale,
reflecting a government thoroughly out of touch with reality.
Although my reaction is stimulated by complaint, it is accompanied by a
proposal for the extension of the valuation banding in a form which I
believe to be more rational and more 'sensitive' than is the present format.
Why stop bands at 'more than Pounds 320,000' when, around the country, in
every county, on the perimeter of every largish town there are pockets of
properties in value, even now, up to about Pounds 500,000?
The existing scaling reveals a percentage differential between Bands A-F
inclusive of about 30 to 35 per cent, but after Pounds 160,000 the
incremental percentage jumps to 100 per cent. I suggest that valuation bands
are extended quite logically and realistically to establish a scale cut-off
at 'more than Pounds 550,000'. Thus:
Band G - more than Pounds 160,000 and up to Pounds 220,000;
Band H - more than Pounds 220,000 and up to Pounds 300,000;
Band I - more than Pounds 300,000 and up to Pounds 400,000;
Band J - more than Pounds 400,000 and up to Pounds 550,000;
Band K - more than Pounds 550,000.
This probably brings with it potential for improvement in council revenues.
When such a scaling is introduced, I for one would feel rather better
disposed towards the new tax than I do at present, when my small bungalow
finds itself in Band G.
Obviously, I have applied for an appeal form, in line I must assume with
thousands of others.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: Dearth of information on needs of manufacturing base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER LYONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I congratulate you on starting your series on the decline of
Britain's manufacturing base. It is research which is desperately needed if
we are to put that decline into reverse.
Unfortunately, the government does not appear to be concerned about the
matter. May I refer you to the written question put down by Nigel Spearing
MP (Newham South). The question was: 'To ask the president of the board of
trade if he will list the manufactured products which ceased to be
manufactured in the United Kingdom since 1980.'
The answer from Tim Sainsbury, minister for industry, on Wednesday February
17 was: 'There are a number of sources of information on manufacturing
products but none is sufficiently comprehensive to allow for an accurate
answer.'
Does that not say it all about this government and the president of the
board of trade? They do not know how or even where to start on the vital
process of rebuilding our manufacturing base.
It would be laughable if it was not so tragic. Thousands of jobs are being
lost in the industries which we so urgently need to rebuild Britain's
wealth.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: Coal industry not dealt a blow by report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARTIN O'NEILL MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Far from dealing a blow to Britain's coal industry ('Regulator deals
blow to coal lobby', February 23), Offer's preliminary report in December
was roundly criticised by both industry and independent commentators. Its
'further statement' shows that it has failed to address many of these
criticisms.
Offer has repeated its earlier mistake of comparing contract prices instead
of generating costs. Professor Littlechild has stated that he will examine
in the future the generators' huge margins on coal-fired electricity.
However, any proper assessment of the 'dash for gas' must take account of
these now.
There is considerable evidence that the cost of coal burn is less than that
of gas-fired generation. I am confident that, once the generators pass on
reduced coal prices in their contracts to the regional electricity
companies, coal will prove to be cheaper than gas. However, until the
director-general has conducted his examination of generators' margins, his
report will effectively be meaningless.
Finally, the report fails to take proper account of the higher gas supply
contracts for later CGGT projects, and does not examine the damaging
implications of the dash for gas for future gas reserves and gas prices. In
conclusion, Offer's misleading 'economic purchasing review' is anything but
a 'green light' for the dash for gas.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial, 'Paying for roads' (February 23), prompts me to inform
you of the real cost of road privatisation. My company's vehicles use the
Severn River toll crossing every day. It now costs Pounds 9.30 for each
heavy goods vehicle to cross into Wales. In the nine months since
privatisation these tolls have been raised twice and are now 55 per cent
higher than at this time last year.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Letter: VAT on food best available option for government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr HUBERT SCHOLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Geoff Rayner and Mr Tim Lang describe VAT on food as a banana skin
the government must avoid (Letters, February 20).
On the contrary, if and when the chancellor needs to raise more revenue,
this (with similar action on other zero-rated goods) is the best option
available.
Of course, if we look at VAT in isolation, it would be a 'tax on the poor'
but the poor can be relieved of the burden by raising income tax thresholds
and welfare benefits, leaving substantial net revenue to be raised from
those who can afford to pay.
Ending zero-rating would remove economic distortions, eliminate tiresome
administrative anomalies (reducing, rather than increasing, bureaucracy) and
bring the UK more closely into line with its European partners, where
Britain's regime has been a long-standing source of difficulty.
It would also help to shift the balance from taxing income to taxing
expenditure, which many regard as both fairer and less of a discouragement
to enterprise.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Nan in the News: Corporate history in the unmaking - Sir
Denys Henderson, last chairman of the old ICI, explains his business
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Denys Henderson sits in his wood-panelled office, a glass of Famous
Grouse whisky in his hand, and reflects on tradition. He is the 11th
chairman of Imperial Chemical Industries and the last of the line. He has
been at ICI for more than half the company's history. He has just spent a
long day explaining to the press and the City why he intends to end that
history by carving the company in two. So how does it feel?
'I have to tell you that, if you're an ICI man through and through, you do
not take these decisions lightly. The sense of history is strong. If you've
spent 35 years with a company and made many friends, you'd be a very strange
guy if you didn't feel a power of nostalgia.'
Looking back, he compares his position with that of a fellow Scot and
predecessor: Lord McGowan, ICI's co-founder and autocratic second chairman
from 1930 to 1950. 'He had the marvellous good fortune to be there to build
the business up. That must have been an enviable time to be involved in the
chemical industry, when it was right at the beginning of its take-off.'
But though the Scots are a bit emotional, he says, they are also realists.
'It's worth remembering why ICI came about in the first place. All these
little companies in Britain had to get together because of the threat to the
British chemical industry from I G Farben, who dominated Europe, and du Pont
who dominated America.
'Right from the start, it was a tough struggle. We were Empire-driven, and
Canada, Australia, South Africa and India are not the world's greatest
chemical markets. Nor is the UK, come to that. That's why we had to spend
the 1980s building our position in Europe and America. If you believe the
tide of history is rolling that way, you have to do what is right for the
company, no matter how much you're running against tradition.'
But this is to make it sound too easy. Throughout its history, ICI has
resisted change. The idea of dividing the company is not new. As early as
1950, a committee of directors was asking itself whether the company should
not be split up. 'Perhaps,' they commented, 'one board might under future
conditions be unable to give sufficiently close and knowledgeable attention
to all (investment) schemes.'
After much dithering, the board came up with a single demerger idea: that of
the metals division, to be known as Imperial Metal Industries (now IMI).
That took a further 12 years to put in train: and even so, it constituted
less than a tenth of ICI by value.
Another case of resistance is more symbolic: Millbank, ICI's headquarters on
the Thames, with its huge bronze doors and the names of the founders carved
in the monumental facade. ICI tried to get away from Millbank a decade ago.
After much debate, however, it settled for an expensive and disruptive
refurbishment.
Contrast what Sir Denys is doing now. Zeneca, the new company which is being
spun off from ICI, is no tiddler like IMI. It is much the biggest part of
the business. It will also move out of Millbank fairly promptly. The rump of
the business - the new ICI - will probably follow after a couple of years.
It is natural to ask how Sir Denys squared up to all this. Who did he
discuss it with? His family, perhaps? Certainly not, he says. 'That's a very
complicated issue to lay on your family. I talked to my colleagues.'
Then again, he had some fairly formidable colleagues to turn to. 'I talked
it over a lot with my non-executives on a one-to-one basis. Being able to
talk it over with Paul Volcker (ex-chairman of the US Federal Reserve) or
Jeremy Morse (chairman of Lloyds Bank) or Anthony Pilkington (chairman of
Pilkington) is pretty helpful. These are objective people.'
All the same, he concedes, he had days of doubt. 'You're a pretty marvellous
guy if you think you're omniscient and you've got it 100 per cent right. You
recycle it over and over again. You read accounts in all sorts of places
that say you're mad, you're crazy. And we gave you guys in the press plenty
to write about: they should, they shouldn't, they will, they won't, it's the
wrong time if they do.'
And, he concedes, the world has changed since the plan was first mooted last
July. 'The chemical world has gone to hell in a handcart. So you're bound to
increasingly ask yourself whether you should put it off. There was all this
personalised stuff saying 'he's got himself in a box, if he doesn't do it
he's for the chop'. That might have been true - I don't know. It's never how
it appeared to me with my colleagues. They have been convinced, like me, of
the business logic.'
The business case for splitting the company remains slightly elusive to the
outsider, despite the efforts ICI has put into explaining itself. Sir
Denys's own account goes back as far as 1984, when ICI's profits burst
through the Pounds 1bn mark.
'Already, we were asking what kind of strategies we needed for the future.
We concluded that the UK economy was unlikely to thrive and that the UK
industrial base was declining. We came to two pretty simple conclusions:
that we had to increase our penetration of the big overseas markets, and we
had to move further out of commodity chemicals into specialities.'
He rattles off figures to demonstrate the working of the strategy. In the
early 1980s, the UK accounted for 40 per cent of ICI's sales. By 1990 it was
20 per per cent. In the early 1980s bulk chemicals were 60 per cent of
sales, specialities 40 per cent. By 1990 it was the other way round.
But in October 1990, Sir Denys had a 'flash of light'. In Phoenix, Arizona,
he took a phone call from his finance director, giving him ICI's
third-quarter results.
'They were OK, but they were Pounds 100m less than we had expected. And the
shortfall wasn't in basic chemicals, it was all in specialty chemicals and
materials. So I instantly thought hello, some bits of this strategy don't
seem to be working.'
So through 1990, he says, they went through the business again, tightening
up the capital, cutting costs, reducing staff. 'In September that year, I
came back from holiday feeling distinctly queasy. Despite all the things we
were doing, it might not be enough.'
So he set up task forces to examine ICI's strategy and structure. 'At the
end of the year they came back and said the structure wasn't right, and that
though the strategy was broadly in the right direction, we were
under-resourcing the businesses which had the real potential. We were trying
to run too many things at once.' Forty years on, ICI was once again asking
itself if it was too big to manage.
The committee looking at the structure had been given a broad brief. 'I told
them to look anywhere they liked: should we consider some form of demerger,
some association with other companies, anything. They looked at an enormous
number of different models, including breaking up the company.'
In May, Sir Denys was faced with what he terms 'a slight diversion'. With
what now looks like supremely ironic timing, Hanson, the break-up
specialist, took a stake in the company. 'Though that didn't distract the
businesses, it took a fair amount of time at headquarters, while we worked
out who was trying to do what to whom and what we should do.'
But by October, it looked as if the threat was not going to materialise. 'So
I got our general manager to dust off the plans on restructuring, because it
seemed to me that the recession was getting still deeper and wider.'
Then, at the end of 1991, he turned to Warburg, ICI's financial advisers. 'I
said to David Scholey (Warburg chairman): 'Lend me somebody who's lively and
intelligent, who doesn't think like us, who can look at our plans and apply
a bit of lateral thinking.' '
Warburg sent a young corporate financier, Mr John Mayo. 'I said to him:
'You're going to report to me personally. I don't want you going out and
about talking to people, because you'll get confused by everyone grinding
their own axes.' So he came back to see me three months later, and sat in
here one Friday afternoon with a book this thick and said: 'Demerger is
something you should consider very seriously.'
'As I went home that weekend, sitting in the car, I thought 'oh God, we've
just been through all the Hanson stuff. Do I really want to start all this
hassle again three years away from retirement?' '
The answer was plainly yes. In seeking a reason, Sir Denys turns again to
history. 'This country lost an empire and had a hell of a job finding a
role. Imperial Chemical Industries first had to move away from being
Empire-driven. Now it has to go the way the world is going in the next
century.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / The dangers of a quick fix: The global economy cannot rely
on the US for leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The US economy is emerging strongly from recession. The torch of leadership
has passed to an able and energetic young Democrat. For the first time in
over a decade, the same political party now controls both houses of Congress
as well as the White House. The Clinton administration is thus better placed
than its recent predecessors to provide global economic and foreign policy
leadership.
None of the other leading industrial countries shares its advantages. Japan
has old and unimpressive political leaders and confronts potentially the
most serious recession in decades. The strains of unification have
undermined Germany's role as Europe's monetary anchor, sent recessionary
ripples across the entire continent and thrown in jeopardy the ambitious
timetable for European economic and monetary union. The UK seems unable to
break out of a protracted downturn and is going through one of its periodic
bouts of acute self-doubt.
President Bill Clinton seems fully aware of his global responsibilities. In
an eloquent speech in Washington yesterday he adopted a lofty
internationalist tone, far removed from his recent carping about Airbus
subsidies. 'Open and competitive commerce will enrich us as a nation,' he
declared. The US had to 'compete not retreat'.
Mr Clinton also sought to place his economic package of last week in the
context of a 'global growth strategy'. The message is that the US has put
its house in order by taking steps to reduce the budget deficit and raise
long-term investment. But while the US is prepared to lead it cannot alone
guarantee global prosperity; the time has come for Germany and Japan to play
their part as engines of global growth.
Mr Clinton left the details for Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US Treasury Secretary,
who is in London for today's meeting of the Group of Seven industrial
countries. It is no secret that the US wants Japan to adopt a more
expansionary fiscal policy and Europe to do something - anything - to
promote faster growth. In US eyes, Europe is most out of line on monetary
policy: short-term interest rates remain far higher than in either the US or
Japan. Mr Bentsen is thus likely gently to press the Bundesbank to consider
an early easing of policy.
The president's attention to international economic issues will be welcomed
abroad. But the best grounds for economic optimism lie not in what Mr
Clinton said but in the vigorous US economic recovery the Democrats have
inherited from the Bush administration. After nearly two years of sluggish
expansion, the US economy is finally taking off: the Commerce Department
yesterday reported stunning GDP figures for the fourth quarter: growth at an
annual rate of 4.8 per cent, the best since 1987.
Most forecasters now believe that steady annual growth of about 3 per cent
is now all but assured. The US is such a self-contained economy (the share
of exports in GDP is still only about 12 per cent) that even a deepening
downturn in other countries is unlikely to jeopardise its recovery. On the
contrary, as incomes and consumption rise in the US, other countries will
benefit from increased demand for their products. The US should thus help
pull other countries out of recession, although the pull will be weaker than
in the early 1980s, when deficit spending sent US demand through the roof.
By curbing future deficits, Mr Clinton may slightly reduce the US growth
rate in coming years. But the effect will be small partly because lower
long-term interest rates will offset fiscal contraction and partly because
the deficit-cutting is less severe than widely appreciated.
Buried at the back of Mr Clinton's A Vision of Change for America is a
revealing table showing projections for the structural budget deficit (the
deficit allowing for the effects of the business cycle). This shows that
planned policy changes will reduce the structural deficit by about Dollars
25bn over the next two years and then hold it steady at about Dollars 200bn
(roughly 3 per cent of GDP) until 1997.
The conventional wisdom that an immediate stimulus will be followed by tough
measures to curb the deficit is thus quite misleading. In reality there is
no stimulus worth mentioning and only the most modest stab at reducing the
structural deficit over the medium-term. Congress however may push for
substantial changes to the plan.
Beyond allowing a spontaneous private-sector-led recovery to gather
momentum, what can the US do to spur global growth? The two areas where US
actions potentially matter most, but where signals to date have at best been
confused, are G 7 policy co-ordination and trade policy.
Since his nomination as US Treasury Secretary last year, Mr Bentsen has
repeatedly stressed his wish to 'revitalise' the G7 co-ordination process.
He says he will rely mainly on private negotiation and promises to eschew
the 'public bullying' that so often proved counterproductive for the Reagan
and Bush administrations.
Unfortunately, he has already blotted his copybook by declaring publicly
last week that he favoured a stronger yen. Predictably, frenzied trading on
foreign exchange markets caused a sharp appreciation of the yen, which
threatens to intensify already powerful recessionary forces in the Japanese
economy. Tokyo was understandably miffed.
The US probably does not know what it wants from policy co-ordination. In a
competitive global economy characterised by highly mobile capital and
instantaneous communications, the G7's significance can easily be
exaggerated. Before leaning too hard on trading partners, Mr Bentsen might
recall that most of the measures advocated by the US in the recent past
subsequently proved misjudged. For example it pushed Japan into
overstimulating its domestic economy in the late 1980s, a mistake that led
directly to a speculative bubble in share and real estate markets and,
ultimately, today's financial turmoil.
In due course the Bundesbank is likely to lower interest rates and Japan's
Ministry of Finance to sanction more expansionary fiscal measures. If the G7
chooses to dress this up as a great triumph of co-ordination - a quid pro
quo for Mr Clinton's 'bold' fiscal retrenchment - that is its prerogative.
In reality, however, these steps are like to be taken when and only when
they are perceived to be in the self-interest of the countries concerned.
Mr Clinton's speech yesterday, which emphasised the importance of US workers
and industries adjusting to the realities of global competition rather than
seeking to shelter behind trade barriers, will offset some of the damage
inflicted by loose protectionist rhetoric in recent weeks. European and
Japanese officials, however, would be right to remain suspicious. The
fierceness of Mr Clinton's complaints about Airbus subsidies is telling the
world something.
Mr Clinton is not an overt protectionist but his stance on trade differs
considerably from that of George Bush. Mr Bush's formative years were the
1940s and 1950s when US industrial supremacy was unchallenged; Mr Clinton's
were the 1970s and 1980s, the decades when the US seemed unable to handle
foreign competition in such sensitive sectors as consumer electronics and
cars.
While Mr Bush took the benefits of a liberal trading system for granted, Mr
Clinton and many of his senior advisers believe the US has lost ground
partly because other countries bent the rules - by refusing to open markets
as fully as the US and by pursuing active industrial policies involving
generous government subsidies for strategic industries.
The Clinton doctrine is that free trade is beneficial but only if the same
standards apply universally. This week he unveiled a mildly interventionist
'technology policy' to meet the perceived threat from European and Japanese
industrial policies; he will continue to press hard for reciprocal trade
concessions abroad whenever he feels other countries are not meeting US
standards. This is a recipe for continued trade tension.
In the past the global economy has performed best when an 'anchor' country
has served both as a guarantor of monetary stability and a champion of the
liberal values on which a market system depends. Britain performed this role
with distinction during the 19th century; the US performed well after the
second world war as the hub of the Bretton Woods exchange rate system.
But towards the end of the 1960s US leadership faltered, mainly because it
failed to keep its own inflation rate under control but also because it lost
sight of its wider global responsibilities. For the past two decades, for
example, the US has perceived the dollar less as a global store of value
than as an instrument to be manipulated for the short-term benefit of
American exporters.
Mr Bentsen's immediate reaction to the widening bilateral trade deficit with
Japan (caused mainly by Japan's domestic slump) is wholly characteristic:
seek a quick fix by talking the dollar down against the yen. It rarely seems
to occur to US policymakers that, in the long run, the countries with the
strongest currencies also enjoy the strongest trade accounts.
Indeed, despite protestations about improving long-run productivity, a kind
of short-termism permeates much of the Clinton administration's economic
strategy. Worried about a lack of investment? For Mr Bentsen the answer is
obvious: dish out a temporary investment tax credit. Just seven short years
after the path-breaking 1986 Tax Reform Act, which eliminated a host of
fiscal distortions, the US Treasury is again manipulating the tax code in
search of temporary economic gain.
Mr Clinton is right to argue for a global growth strategy. But despite the
seductive rhetoric there is a danger that the US in practice will continue
to press for quick fixes - such as fiscal boosts or currency realignments -
and lose sight of the more important long-term determinants of prosperity,
such as a genuinely liberal trade regime and non-inflationary monetary
policies. The question is whether it will be a good anchor for the world
economy in the short or the long term.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Leading Article: Jawboning in the G7
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE notable exception of the US, the leading industrialised countries
face an increasingly bleak economic prospect this year. Japan is
experiencing the biggest decline in output since the oil shock of the
mid-1970s, while the banking system creaks under the weight of mountainous
bad debts in property. Germany is sinking further into recession as the
Bundesbank sticks doggedly to its anti-inflationary stance. The French
economy is hamstrung by absurdly high real rates of interest and actually
shrank in the fourth quarter of last year. Meantime the elusive British
recovery remains just that: elusive.
At times like this, when global growth is unequally distributed and trade
imbalances are mounting, leaders of the Group of Seven industrialised
countries are tempted to cook up plans to invigorate the world economy.
Yesterday President Bill Clinton succumbed to the urge.
In an explicit return to the rhetoric of global policy coordination, he
called for Japan and Germany to 'act as engines of global prosperity'. And
the Treasury Secretary Mr Lloyd Bentsen, in London this weekend for the G7
meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors, has made no secret
of his wish to push the G7 into a more active global role.
Yet past experience, from the locomotive experiment of the late 1970s, to
the Plaza and Louvre accords of the 1980s, suggests that co-operative
growthmanship has a nasty way of ending in disaster. Equally to the point,
much of the G7 is already pushing in the right direction under powerful
domestic impetus; and those countries, like Germany, where policy change is
overdue, have a compelling agenda of their own.
The Bundesbank is unlikely to succumb to siren calls for looser monetary
policy, at least not at a time when its worries about inflation are palpably
justified. It is fully entitled, on its past record, to take its own counsel
on the appropriate moment to ease.
Economic costs
Nor are the French likely to be any more accommodating. A country that has
been prepared to incur huge economic costs within the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism for wider foreign policy goals is unlikely to throw in the towel
now for the sake of G7 co-operation. France's reading of its own interests
may be difficult for others to fathom, but its dismal unemployment figures
bear witness to the depth of the commitment to the franc fort policy.
Japan looks a more tempting target for a new US administration. As the
world's largest creditor nation, with plenty of room for fiscal manoeuvre,
it could readily move in a more expansionist direction; and the US has
traditionally exerted greater influence on its domestic affairs. Yet the
dire state of the Japanese economy owes much to earlier US demands for
looser monetary policy in the second half of the 1980s. Nor are calls for a
further appreciation of the yen helpful, since they imply a misreading of
the Japanese trade surplus.
Japanese exports have shown scarcely any growth over the past two years. The
yen, meantime, is already at record levels both in trade weighted and dollar
terms. Such has been the pressure on profits in Japanese industry that job
cuts are beginning to take place in an economy where the big corporations
traditionally shelter the workforce from the depredations of recession. This
week's news of Nissan's decision to close a car plant was a further
psychological shock. The reason Japan's trade surplus has soared is simply
that imports have collapsed as the economy sinks into the mire.
Trade imbalance
The longer term causes of the US-Japan trade imbalance are structural. They
reflect the excessive Japanese propensity to save and the equal and opposite
lack of saving in the US. By showing willingness to address an excessive US
budget deficit in his State of the Union message, President Clinton is at
least moving in a constructive direction. But this new-found fiscal virtue
is no reason to pressurise the Japanese when the country is already pulling
out the stops to prevent a financial collapse. A further, expansionary
fiscal package is widely regarded as inevitable at a time when the Japanese
social contract is more seriously threatened than it has been for decades.
In short, domestic political pressure and market forces are already pushing
Japan in the direction that President Clinton wants. The same is true in all
the other economies that have been particularly heavily burdened by debt,
not least Britain, where high profile lay-offs this week by ICI and British
Gas tend to distract attention from the underlying reality - namely, that
the government cannot escape from a severe fiscal bind without restoring
rapid economic growth.
The moral for the G7 is that there is no harm in jawboning the Germans over
their fiscal irresponsibility, nor in seeking to fathom the self-denying
economic habits of the French. But Mr Clinton's exhortations on trade, and
on assistance for Russia, offer a more promising agenda than any global dash
for growth.

FT  27 FEB 93 / ICI may leave Millbank: Company plans to cut nearly half its
headquarters staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMPERIAL Chemical Industries, one of the UK's largest companies, plans to
cut nearly half of its headquarters staff and may abandon its historic
headquarters at Millbank near the Houses of Parliament.
ICI employs about 450 people at Millbank and neighbouring Ergon House.
Mr David Barnes, chief executive of Zeneca, which will become ICI's
independent bioscience subsidiary, said his group would move out of
Millbank, probably over the next 12 months and certainly within two years.
His headquarters staff would number no more than 100 and possibly as few as
80. Zeneca's new headquarters would ideally be located within a mile of
Millbank, he added.
Speaking the day after ICI announced it would split in two, Mr Ronnie
Hampel, deputy chairman and future chief executive of the new ICI, said the
number of staff at his new headquarters would be between 100 and 200.
During a staff meeting yesterday Mr Hampel raised the issue of selling the
historic building, although he said it would not raise as much as it should
because of the state of the property market.
Other options raised by Mr Hampel include moving staff now based elsewhere
into Millbank or renting out some floors to outside companies. ICI shares
rose 55p to Pounds 12.08.
BhS, part of the Storehouse retail group, is cutting 800 full-time and 2,300
Saturday jobs, but creating 2,000 part-time jobs in a further move towards
flexible working in the retail sector.
The store chain said the changes were aimed at ensuring well-trained staff
were always available to provide higher levels of service at peak times,
especially on Saturdays, and to remove anomalies in the existing staff
structure. Management staff at BhS have already been reduced by 900.
The full-time job cuts now being made at store level account for more than a
quarter of the present total of 3,000 full-time jobs, while Saturday losses
account for nearly 40 per cent of weekend-only working.
They will be replaced by 2,000 jobs working between 12 and 20 hours a week.
The total number of employees will fall from about 13,000 to 12,000.
All remaining staff working more than 12 hours a week will be entered on
National Vocational Qualification training schemes to raise standards of
customer service. Basic pay will be increased.
BhS said it hoped some people losing their jobs would accept part-time jobs,
provided they met NVQ competence standards. But some compulsory redundancies
were likely.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Scottish yard cuts most of its workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDERMOTT, the US owner of the Ardersier offshore fabrication yard near
Inverness, one of northern Scotland's biggest employers, is to make most of
its remaining 500 workers redundant, Andrew Taylor writes.
The yard, which employed 3,500 workers 18 months ago, will run out of work
on Monday when it is due to complete a contract for part of a North Sea
production platform.
McDermott says that Ardersier will then move to 'little more than care and
maintenance'. The yard is expected to employ only about 75 people by the
beginning of April. More than half of the jobs are to go next week.
The redundancies are the latest in a series in yards in Scotland and
north-east England. This month the Offshore Manufacturers' and Constructors'
Association estimated that the number of workers employed by offshore
fabricators, including sub-contractors, had halved to 10,000 since
September.
Manufacturers are forecasting a further 3,000 job losses in the next few
months as investment in North Sea exploration continues to dwindle.
McDermott insisted it was maintaining its commitment to the yard in which it
invested Pounds 25m in 1986.

FT  27 FEB 93 / MPs urge tighter financial controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE ON the government to strengthen the present system of financial
services regulation increased yesterday when a former Tory trade and
industry secretary joined a cross-party group of MPs in tabling two critical
motions.
Mr Paul Channon, the MP for Southend West, was one of six MPs who signed a
motion highlighting the 'inadequacies' of the present system of
self-regulation for banks and building societies.
Expressing 'grave concern' at the plight of elderly holders of home income
plans, the MPs urged the government to ensure mortgages were treated as
investments for the purposes of the 1986 Financial Services Act.
Mr Channon, whose time as trade and industry secretary partly coincided with
the passage of this act through the Commons, also backed a second motion
urging the Securities and Investments Board to proceed 'with urgency' to set
up the proposed Personal Investment Authority.
The motion, which has so far been signed by eight MPs, endorsed the
principle of self-regulation of financial services but acknowledged a 'lack
of confidence' in the existing system.
The motion says the PIA's establishment should create a single system
'embracing banks and building societies, as well as those bodies and
individuals currently covered by Fimbra and Lautro, to resolve complaints
and provide compensation for investors'.
SIB has said that it might refuse to recognise the PIA as the new
self-regulatory body for retail financial services if it does not raise
standards of investor protection.
Earlier this month the PIA appointed Sir Brian Jenkins, a partner at
accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand, to conduct an independent review of
membership criteria.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Smith sees threat in jobless toll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S onslaught on the government over the recession intensified
yesterday as Mr John Smith, the party leader, issued a stark warning that
unemployment was reaching levels that posed a serious social threat.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was yesterday once again upbeat about the
economy. He said he thought people might be inclined to spend now they had
repaid debts.
'It could be that the tide is turning, but it is too early to say how
profound that change is,' the prime minister said.
But Mr Smith insisted that 'second-hand assurances' from Mr Major that the
economy was on the brink of recovery were failing to convince people.
Speaking in Cardiff, he warned that unemployment was reaching 'an extremely
dangerous level'.
He said: 'It is beginning not only to menace our prospects of economic
recovery, but we are on the edge of having serious social problems.'
As the opposition sought to capitalise on unease about government
performance suggested by opinion polls, all three main parties were turning
their minds to the forthcoming by-election at Newbury, Berkshire. The seat,
held by the Tories with a majority of about 12,000 against a Liberal
Democrat challenge at last year's general election, will offer the first
test of how far the continued recession has turned opinion against the
Conservatives since last April.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Writs issued by BCCI liquidator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIQUIDATOR to the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
yesterday issued new writs against accountants Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp;
Young in connection with their audits of the bank.
The writs cover Price Waterhouse and Ernst &amp; Whinney, now part of Ernst &amp;
Young, for the audits of the bank in 1986, and PW for its audit in 1987.
They follow writs issued last March against both firms for their 1985 BCCI
audits, and a statement of claim in October believed to be for damages
against losses in the bank in the range of Dollars 8bn-Dollars 10bn. It is
believed the sums involved for the latest writs will amount to about Dollars
5bn (Pounds 3.5bn) for each of the two years listed. But the numbers
associated with the claim will not be provided unless or until a detailed
statement of claim is filed with the courts. The writs seek interest, costs,
further relief, damages and compensation for alleged negligence, and/or
breach of duty, statutory duty and breach of contract.
The Bank of England faced fresh criticism of its handling of BCCI yesterday
when 43 MPs called for a review of Mr Eddie George's appointment as
governor-designate.
The MPs called in a early day motion for Mr George's appointment to be
reviewed by the Treasury and Civil Service committee. The motion urged the
appointment of an outsider 'untainted by the soiled and over-cosy ethos' at
the Bank.

<TEXT>
MR ALAN YENTOB, the controller of BBC2, was yesterday appointed controller
of BBC1.
It is the first time since 1965 that the person in charge of the
corporation's minority channel has gone on to run the BBC's more mainstream
television station.
One of his early tasks will be to decide what to do about Eldorado, the soap
opera set in Spain which was commissioned by his predecessor at BBC1, Mr
Jonathan Powell.
Yesterday Mr Yentob said it had failed in ratings terms. 'It doesn't seem to
have done the business,' he said, although he would not be drawn on the
soap's fate.
According to Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of network television, only Mr
Yentob, 45, went before a sub-committee of the BBC governors on Thursday
evening.
All the signs are that Mr Yentob, controller of BBC2 since 1988 and regarded
as a considerable success, did not initially apply for the job.
'I decided that I wanted to do it and I do want to do it,' he said
yesterday.
He said his main task would be to offer the audience a genuine choice,
although he supported the emphasis Mr John Birt, the director-general, was
placing on the BBC pro-ducing 'distinctive' programmes.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Venue for chess match rejected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GARY KASPAROV and his British challenger Nigel Short have refused to play
their world chess championship match in Manchester and are setting up a
rival organisation to Fide, the international chess federation, to stage
their own version of the event.
Mr Kasparov and Mr Short said they would play for the championship under the
auspices of the Professional Chess Association. They would give 10 per cent
of the prize fund to set up the association.
Manchester City Council said the dispute was between Fide and the players.
It hoped problems would be resolved quickly so plans could continue to stage
the match in August. Fide refused to comment before it had confirmed a
statement issued by the players in London yesterday
This claimed Fide had shown 'wilful disregard' by not consulting the players
about accepting Manchester's bid, as Fide said on Tuesday it had.
The statement was issued by Simpson's-in-the-Strand, the London restaurant
which is a traditional centre for chess. But Mr Ray Keene, a British
grandmaster who is chess correspondent of The Times and an adviser to Mr
Kasparov, said it had been prepared with the players' collaboration by
himself and Mr Dominic Lawson, editor of The Spectator, Weekend FT columnist
and an adviser to Mr Short.
Mr Lawson said: 'Nigel Short was on a boat between Italy and Greece when
Fide announced its decision. He had specifically said he wanted to study all
the bids, which he was not allowed to do. Players at this level will not be
treated as pawns.'
Mr Keene said: 'This has been coming for years. We are confident all the
world's leading professionals will join the new association.'
The players yesterday invited new bids for their match. Mr Keene said the
London Chess Group - a group of businesses supporting the game - had
yesterday confirmed it would bid again after losing to Manchester.
Manchester wants the match but is unlikely to bid for fear of antagonising
the International Olympic Committee by going against an official
international umbrella organisation for a sport. Manchester is bidding to
stage the 2000 games.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE miners' consortium which last year leased Monktonhall colliery near
Edinburgh from British Coal is to seek a partner or outside investor to
provide finance to overcome funding problems.
Monktonhall Mineworkers is owned by its 160 employees, who have invested
Pounds 10,000 each in the company. It blamed the need for additional finance
on a three-month delay in starting production. It wants to buy equipment to
develop a second coalface.
The colliery, closed by British Coal in 1987, resumed production at the end
of last year. It has a contract to supply 87,000 tonnes of domestic coal to
British Coal and is fulfilling a trial order for 12,000 tonnes of power
station coal. Mr Jackie Aitchison, Monktonhall chairman, said the company
was continuing to operate thanks to the support of its bank, Bank of
Scotland, and 'the understanding of our suppliers'.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Airport baggage security to be tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGH new baggage security measures for all British airports were announced
by the government yesterday.
The measures will eventually ensure that all hold baggage will be X-rayed
and every piece of luggage put on board an aircraft will be matched to a
passenger.
Lord Caithness, the transport minister, said a directive setting out the
scheme to match baggage would be issued by the end of June. He hoped it
could come into effect by the end of the year.
Unaccompanied baggage or any item that could not be accounted for would be
subjected to stringent security controls before it was authorised to be
carried, he said.
Lord Caithness, who was attending an aviation security symposium near
Manchester Airport, said the total screening of hold baggage by special
X-ray machines would take three to 3 1/2 years to introduce. The cost of the
exercise is understood to be the main reason for phasing.
Manchester Airport's Pounds 265m Terminal 2, which opens next week and has
state-of-the-art equipment, has 27 of the new X-ray machines for which it
paid more than Pounds 2m. Mr David Teale, technical services director, said
more machines would be needed - at a cost of at least Pounds 60,000 each.
'We think the government should be helping the airports and the airlines to
meet some of the costs,' he said.
The new machines are situated immediately behind check-in desks. Before
getting their boarding cards passengers can be called into a secure area to
open their baggage for inspection if required.
Matching passengers to baggage is already done manually at most airports,
although Manchester will examine whether this can be automated using
bar-coded labels now attached to luggage for automated sorting and handling.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Maxwell pensioners suffer setback: A look at the
consequences of the social security committee's fears over sub judice rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PENSIONERS reacted with dismay to the decision by the cross-party Commons
social security committee to postpone part of its investigation into the
theft of Maxwell company pension funds.
The committee's move follows advice from the Serious Fraud Office, which
warned MPs last month that taking evidence in public from witnesses who
might also be called in criminal proceedings could prejudice those trials.
Yesterday the committee called on the Commons to consider the impact of its
own sub judice rule on select committees' work, by referring the issue to
the procedure committee. Since it has played a significant part in keeping
up the pressure on the government over the issue and given the Maxwell
pensioners a high profile, the campaigners clearly regard the delay to the
inquiry as a blow.
Mr Ken Trench, the chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said
yesterday: 'It now appears that the select committee is being gagged by the
call for justice for two or three individuals, and thousands of pensioners
are suffering. We feel that the SFO has made a major mistake, and that
justice for the Maxwell pensioners is being denied.'
Committee members are keen, however, to dispel the idea that the
postponement marks the end of their interest in the Maxwell affair.
Mr Frank Field, the Labour committee chairman, said the inquiry would resume
after relevant criminal proceedings had been completed, even though this
would not be for many months. Mr David Shaw, a Tory committee member,
emphasised that the MPs still intended to 'make sure the pensioners'
interests are being looked after'.
The committee spent several meetings discussing whether it could hear
evidence privately, but the report concluded the risks of doing so were too
great.
It said: 'This approach would leave the inquiry open to rumour and
speculation, some of it possibly deliberately contrived in order to suggest
that the committee was conducting itself in a way which could affect the
legal proceedings.'
While Mr Field said the committee was relaxed about the decision, the
report's call for a review of the operation of the sub judice rule reflects
the frustration privately expressed by some committee members.
The MPs have contrasted their own position unfavourably with the greater
freedom enjoyed by some of their counterparts overseas, such as the
congressional committees in the United States.
This is the second time the rights and role of the Commons committees, set
up in 1979, have been brought into question by the Maxwell inquiry. In March
last year the committee said the Commons should consider the prima facie
contempt of the House shown by Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell's refusal to
answer the committee's questions.
Though some MPs feel uneasy at the committee's strong line against the
Maxwell brothers, others have relished the way its work has expanded beyond
the government's conduct into inquiring into the conduct of the professions
involved in the Maxwell affair and trying to track down the missing money.
They will not easily relinquish this.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Pit consortium seeks investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE miners' consortium which last year leased Monktonhall colliery near
Edinburgh from British Coal is to seek a partner or outside investor to
provide finance to overcome funding problems.
Monktonhall Mineworkers is owned by its 160 employees, who have invested
Pounds 10,000 each in the company. It blamed the need for additional finance
on a three-month delay in starting production. It wants to buy equipment to
develop a second coalface.
The colliery, closed by British Coal in 1987, resumed production at the end
of last year. It has a contract to supply 87,000 tonnes of domestic coal to
British Coal and is fulfilling a trial order for 12,000 tonnes of power
station coal for ScottishPower.
Mr Jackie Aitchison, Monktonhall chairman, said the company was continuing
to operate thanks to the support of its bank, Bank of Scotland, and 'the
understanding of our suppliers'.
It had decided to ask Price Waterhouse, its financial adviser, to gauge the
level of interest from potential partners and investors.
Monktonhall hopes that either a financial institution or a company involved
in the coal industry will step in.
The consortium failed to attract investment from outside institutions or
public funding agencies last year and is financed entirely by the Pounds
1.6m subscriptions of the miners, many of whom took out loans to buy their
shares. Mr Aitchison said it was receiving no government or European
Community subsidy.
Last December Mr Jim Parker, the mining engineer who led the consortium and
put together its business plan, resigned as managing director after a
disagreement with other members of the consortium.
Council leaders from mining areas yesterday urged the government to retain
all 31 pits threatened with closure when it announces its expected rescue
package next month.
Chief executives and councillors from 14 district councils in England and
Wales also pressed British Coal to extend the special redundancy package
beyond the deadline of March 31.

FT  27 FEB 93 / BBC2 chief is appointed as controller of BBC1
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN YENTOB, the controller of BBC2, was yesterday appointed controller
of BBC1.
It is the first time since 1965 that the person in charge of the
corporation's minority channel has gone on to run the BBC's more mainstream
television channel.
One of his early tasks will be to decide what to do about Eldorado, the soap
opera set in Spain which was commissioned by his predecessor at BBC1, Mr
Jonathan Powell.
Yesterday Mr Yentob said it had failed in ratings terms. 'It doesn't seem to
have done the business,' he said, although he would not be drawn on the
soap's fate.
Seven or eight candidates were assessed for one of British broadcasting's
most attractive jobs.
According to Mr Will Wyatt, managing director of network television, only Mr
Yentob, 45, went before a sub-committee of the BBC governors on Thursday
evening.
All the signs are that Mr Yentob, controller of BBC2 since 1988 and regarded
as a considerable success, did not initially apply for the job.
'I decided that I wanted to do it and I do want to do it,' he said
yesterday.
Programmes introduced during Mr Yentob's time at BBC2 have ranged from The
Late Show, The Second Russian Revolution and Troubleshooter to comedy such
as Harry Enfield and French and Saunders.
Mr Yentob will be the senior programme controller and will deputise for Mr
Wyatt on all editorial matters.
He said his main task would be to offer the audience a genuine choice,
although he supported the emphasis Mr John Birt, the director-general, was
placing on the BBC producing 'distinctive' programmes.
A new BBC2 controller will be appointed in three or four weeks. Mr Michael
Jackson, the present head of arts programmes, is seen as a strong candidate.

FT  27 FEB 93 / BhS to shed 800 full-time jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BhS, part of the Storehouse retail group, is cutting 800 full-time and 2,300
Saturday jobs, but creating 2,000 part-time jobs in a further move towards
flexible working in the retail sector.
The store chain said the changes were aimed at ensuring well-trained staff
were always available to provide higher levels of service at peak times,
especially on Saturdays, and to remove anomalies in the existing staff
structure.
Storehouse's move follows a similar one by Burton, the retail clothing
group, which announced last month it was cutting 2,000 full-time jobs but
creating up to 3,000 part-time ones.
Management staff at BhS have already been reduced by 900 by Mr David
Dworkin, the outgoing chief executive widely credited with having turned the
group around.
The full-time job cuts now being made at store level account for more than a
quarter of the present total of 3,000 full-time jobs, while Saturday losses
account for nearly 40 per cent of weekend-only working.
They will be replaced by 2,000 jobs working between 12 and 20 hours a week.
The total number of employees will fall from about 13,000 to 12,000.
All remaining staff working more than 12 hours a week will be entered on
National Vocational Qualification training schemes to raise standards of
customer service. Basic pay will be increased.
BhS said it hoped some people losing their jobs would accept part-time jobs,
provided they met NVQ competence standards. But some compulsory redundancies
were likely.
The chain is also contracting out cleaning and security functions, involving
about 300 cleaners and 40 security personnel, but hopes most of these will
be offered jobs with the contractors.
BhS expects the changes to cost about Pounds 2m, but said this would be more
than outweighed by savings in future.
Mr Steve Bedford, Storehouse's group development director, said BhS
regretted having to make redundancies in the present economic situation. He
said: 'BhS has restructured its head office, store management and regional
organisation, cutting out unnecessary bureaucracy. Now, with new staffing
arrangements in the stores, the whole business really is focused on the
customer.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Smith sees threat in jobless toll
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
LABOUR'S onslaught on the government over the recession intensified
yesterday as Mr John Smith, the party leader, issued a stark warning that
unemployment was reaching levels that posed a serious social threat.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, was yesterday once again upbeat about the
economy, saying he thought people might be inclined to spend again now they
had repaid debts incurred a few years earlier.
'It could be that the tide is turning, but it is too early to say how
profound that change is,' the prime minister said.
But Mr Smith insisted that 'second-hand assurances' from Mr Major that the
economy was on the brink of recovery were failing to convince people.
Speaking in Cardiff, he warned that unemployment was reaching 'an extremely
dangerous level'.
'It is beginning not only to menace our prospects of economic recovery, but
we are on the edge of having serious social problems,' he said.
As the opposition sought to capitalise on unease about government
performance suggested by opinion polls, such as that in the Times yesterday,
which gave them a 12 point lead, all three main parties are turning their
minds to the forthcoming by-election at Newbury.
The seat, held by the Tories with a majority of about 12,000 against a
Liberal Democrat challenge at the general election, will offer the first
test of how far the continued economic recession has turned opinion against
the Conservatives since last April.
With the return of Mr Major the Tories will use their local government
conference today to seek to regain the political initiative and steady the
nerves among their supporters.
Sir Norman Fowler, the Tory chairman, will lead the offensive with a return
to the theme of law and order and an attack on opinion pollsters, based on
their poor performance in last year's election campaign.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Banks and Small Companies: Lessons of the 80s spark policy
review - The relationship between banks and small businesses is in upheaval.
With 80,000 company failures last year and a similar number forecast for
1993, lenders are seeking a fresh approach to overdrafts, loans and equity
finance. FT reporters assess the lending pressures on companies and banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HIGH STREET banks are reviewing their policies on lending to small and
medium-sized businesses as the size of problems from their 1980s lending
strikes them. This is leading to some fundamental changes in policy.
One change is that banks are becoming more restrictive in the overdraft
facilities they offer. Because many of these overdrafts were used as a
substitute for equity capital in the 1980s, banks are now encouraging
fixed-term loans instead.
Such changes have led to fears of a 'credit crunch' for small businesses,
but banks deny that they are withdrawing credit. They say they are merely
trying to ensure that loans are used for working capital rather than equity.
Banks argue that small business lending is more risky than they had
appreciated before. They believe they require a combination of higher
pricing and more information on how loans are used if they are to remain in
the market.
Fixed-term loans are useful as a monitoring tool because a bank can see
immediately when interest payments are not met, rather than having to watch
movements in overdrafts closely to detect underlying patterns of cashflow.
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland, this week tried to stimulate a
debate about small-business financing by arguing that the government, banks
and businesses had to form a partnership to stimulate new forms of equity
finance.
Mr Pearse's suggestions included a Pounds 67m 'loan support scheme' to
provide subsidies to cut the price of banks' medium and long-term loans to 1
percentage point over base - rather than the current 2 to 3 points.
He also argued that this scheme for manufacturing industry could be
supplemented with a 'manufacturing support scheme' which would try to
attract individuals to offer equity capital to small, local companies by
giving them tax breaks.
Mr Pearse believes financing for small companies in Britain should to be
re-thought in comparison with countries such as Germany, where only 14 per
cent of small-business debt is in overdraft form, compared with 58 per cent
in Britain.
Ms Jane Bradford, National Westminster's head of small business services,
says banks are increasingly limiting small businesses' access to overdrafts
because of their experience with bad debts from lending in the 1980s.
'Small businesses have been over-reliant on overdrafts. They have met
long-term financing needs with short-term borrowing,' says Ms Bradford,
whose bank is lending about Pounds 11bn to small businesses.
The confusion has proved problematic for NatWest as it tries to clear up a
mass of poor lending which originated in the late 1980s. It has found that
many overdrafts in theory provided for working capital have turned into
loans.
NatWest and Barclays are the two biggest lenders to small businesses. Some
55 per cent of the bank's lending in the sector is in the form of
overdrafts, and 45 per cent in loans with fixed terms.
The bank's problems with small-business lending were shown this week in its
1992 results. Of a Pounds 1.3bn provision for bad debts on lending in its UK
branch business, 47 per cent related to loans of less than Pounds 50,000.
It is now trying to limit overdrafts to cases where they are clearly going
to be used to day-to-day working capital. It wants businesses to accept term
loans, often on fixed interest rates, for machinery, premises and vehicles.
NatWest is also trying to clean up permanent overdrafts by converting them
into loans. It regards clearly defined forms of lending as essential to
allow the bank to monitor what happens to its money more closely.
NatWest says businesses seek overdrafts believing they will be cheaper
because of their flexibility. Many have been unable to reduce overdrafts
because cashflow has not met projections.
A report on equity finance will appear in next week's UK Companies pages.

JOHN FARMER, owner of PKI, an expanding coatings company in Chester, has
mixed feelings about banks.
He abandoned Lloyds after a dispute about his overdraft. 'We changed to
Barclays, but I decided to get out of the hands of the banks as far as
financing growth was concerned.'
Today PKI has a Pounds 1.25m turnover and is growing at 25 per cent a year.
The workforce at the company, which coats plastic components in imitation
gold and silver, has grown from 46 to 60 in two years.
Like many small businessmen Mr Farmer wanted a flexible overdraft facility
because it offered easier access to working capital than a loan.
He turned to Barclays after Lloyds declined to increase his overdraft limit
to Pounds 180,000 and tried instead to set a Pounds 125,000 limit with
higher charges. Although Mr Farmer now has an overdraft limit of only Pounds
50,000 at Barclays, he has continued expanding by using an intermediary
finance house.
The finance house - Griffin Factors, a subsidiary of Midland Bank - agreed
to offer PKI debtor discounting, a system of speeding cashflow. At the end
of each week Griffin sends Mr Farmer a cheque for 80 per cent of his
invoiced sales. He pays Griffin when PKI is paid by its customers.
The cost of what is, in effect, increased working capital works out at 2 per
cent over base rate, compared with 2 1/2 per cent for his overdraft.
Administration costs on his Griffin contract are less than the  1/2 point
difference. His personal guarantee - his own risk - is only on the
overdraft.
Taking advantage of such facilities is an important shift from the 1980s
when overdrafts were calculated by formula: 70 per cent of assets, plus half
the value of money owed to a business by its customers.
Grahame Elliott of Stoy Hayward, PKI's auditor in Manchester, says:
'Everything is a case by case situation now.'
The changing relationship between banks and small companies is summed up by
Paul Davidson, managing director of Bolton Business Venture, an enterprise
agency advising small businesses. 'There are no formulae now. Information is
crucial. The banks are carrying out validation of sales forecasts, making
quarterly visits and demanding monthly management accounts.
'We had a meeting with local bankers to see if they had altered their
criteria for lending. They all said they had a surplus of funds and were
anxious to do deals, but that the quality of proposals was weak.'
The banks' new approach is raising questions among accountants and advisers
about whether small businesses will get the working capital many need to
ride the expected economic upturn. Such capital is necessary to help
companies avoid overtrading - not having the cash to pay wages, creditors
and interest charges quickly enough to stay in business because finances are
tied up in stocks, work-in-progress and debtors.
John Evans, a Birmingham interior designer, says: 'Business in the last
three months has come back with a vengeance. But the banks won't finance you
and they won't release the money. It's not the price of it that's the
problem, it's getting it.'
Responses are patchy, however. Many accountants say banking facilities can
vary widely according to lending terms drawn up by managers with different
attitudes to small businesses.
Access to funds has not been a problem for Jim Mundell, chairman of United
Forgemasters in Dudley, whose forging group has taken on more workers to
cope with increased orders. 'We are getting money at a sensible price,' he
says. 'There has never been so much money flushing around the system. It is
there because people are taking a more responsible attitude to how they're
doing their lending.'
His view is echoed at UKPS, an environmental engineering company on the
Warwick University Science Park. It has changed clearing banks twice in the
last 18 months - from National Westminster to Royal Bank of Scotland then to
Barclays. 'There are problems but we are not hard up,' says Robert Eden, the
managing director. 'When we need more flexibility we can negotiate,'
Accountants say that in some cases banks have reduced overdraft ceilings to
match the new balances created when debtors have made payments.
Mr Elliott said: 'If values of property now start rising and businesses
start doing better, there is a danger some banks will pounce to recoup loans
by shutting companies down to realise the assets.'
According to one Glasgow accountant companies should protect themselves
against such eventualities by negotiating with the banks before embarking on
expansion.
'It's no good taking a lot of new orders and then going to the bank to ask
them to finance an increase in turnover. You've got to get the bank lined up
first,' he says.
'The banks are realising that some companies with high working-capital needs
are going to have major problems coming out of recession.'
Many accountants believe the attitude of the banks could force small
businesses to seek alternative funds from Britain's venture capital
industry, which is estimated to have reserves of more than Pounds 1bn.
Banks say they are into 'relationship lending' and insist no sound business
will be starved of working capital.
They say there will be tougher scrutiny. Overdrafts will be available for
working capital only. Risk capital for new ventures might have to be sought
elsewhere.
But one banker warned: 'It's going to cost more. Scrutiny is going to push
up charges.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Banks and Small Companies: Blaming a bank when all goes sour
 -The relationship between banks and small businesses is in upheaval. With
80,000 company failures last year and a similar number forecast for 1993,
lenders are seeking a fresh approach to overdrafts, loans and equity
finance. FT reporters assess the lending pressures on companies and banks

BILL BOWLING'S world disintegrated in January. He lost his construction
business and now faces losing his home.
Like many businessmen who have called in receivers, the former chairman and
majority shareholder of Clayton Bowmore blames a bank.
He says National Westminster's decision to cut the overdraft limit for his
Yorkshire-based company from Pounds 550,000 to Pounds 250,000 created a
cashflow crisis it could not survive. NatWest denies its actions were
precipitate. As far as it was concerned Clayton Bowmore was another casualty
of the recession - a victim of over-expansion and poor cashflow.
The bank says: 'We asked accountants KPMG Peat Marwick to prepare two
reports on the company last year. The second concluded the company was
insolvent. An independent insolvency practitioner, already working with the
company, said that the business would require more money to survive.'
Mr Bowling says the bank pulled the plug even though the company had
negotiated sales that would have enabled it to repay Pounds 400,000 of its
Pounds 2.2m borrowings.
Mr Bowling, who had given a personal guarantee of Pounds 200,000 against
bank loans, argues the company's gearing was no worse than many publicly
owned construction companies. 'The book value remained marginally greater
than the bank debt even after the savage write-downs recommended by KPMG,
which have been appointed receivers,' he says.
The rise and fall of Clayton Bowmore mirrors the experiences of many
companies during the recession. It was formed in November 1975 with just
Pounds 100, a Morris van and a lot of optimism. Within four years annual
turnover had reached Pounds 3m. During the 12 months to the end of March
1992 the group made a Pounds 250,000 pre-tax profit on a Pounds 16m
turnover. The seeds of its destruction, however, were sown with the move
into housebuilding in the late 1980s.
For a while all went well. House prices and sales remained stronger in
northern England than in the south. NatWest, however, was concerned and
asked KPMG to prepare its first report, which included a substantial
write-down on book values. Work in progress was valued at zero, debtors were
included at 50 per cent of book value and property and land values were cut,
according to Mr Bowling. KPMG reduced its estimates even further in the
second report. Mr Bowling says such treatment could be justified only if the
company had already been judged unviable.
KPMG says Mr Bowling's reaction is understandable, but stands by its
judgment. The accountants say the recommendations on ways to reduce
overheads were largely ignored by the company, which underestimated its
likely losses for this financial year.
The countdown to collapse started on September 15 when the government raised
base rates to 15 per cent. 'That day we lost five houses worth a total of
Pounds 250,000,' says Mr Bowling. The company, which had been expecting a
sale a week, has made fewer than six since Black Wednesday.
On the morning of January 15 the company received a payment for more than
Pounds 300,000. It immediately posted cheques worth more than Pounds 150,000
to suppliers. 'At 4.15pm the bank rang to say it was reducing our overdraft
facility by the exact amount of the payment we had received,' says Mr
Bowling.
NatWest says it warned the company that it retained the right to reduce the
overdraft limit by the amount of any cheques receive.
Mr Bowling says: 'NatWest refused to honour the cheques we had sent out.
Word got round and the client stopped the Pounds 300,000 cheque before it
had time to clear. So nobody gained.'
On January 27, with insufficient cash to pay wages, the receivers were
called in.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Patten loses support in Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Chris Patten's position in Hong Kong weakened perceptibly yesterday
when his supporters turned on him for delaying publication of legislation
which, if enacted, would make elections in the colony more democratic.
The delay has left Mr Patten exposed to the accusation of acquiescing to
Beijing's demands for him to abandon his package. Hong Kong's pro-democracy
politicians accused Britain of selling out Hong Kong in the wake of the
decision announced on Thursday.
Mr Patten was due to gazette his legislation by the end of this month but
drew back in the hope China would agree to talks on Hong Kong's political
future.
His decision was, however, greeted enthusiastically by Hong Kong's stock
market - the Hang Seng Index rose 148.11 points to close at 6,351.99 - and
won support from the colony's conservative politicians.
Mr Martin Lee, leader of the United Democrats, said the UK had lost the
negotiating battle with China before it had begun. He said the people of
Hong Kong knew who lost every time Britain and China sat down at the
negotiating table. 'Have you ever seen the British winning anything by
negotiations with the Chinese government?' he said.
The Hong Kong Economic Journal, the colony's leading business newspaper and
long-time supporter of Mr Patten, sharply criticised him for deferring
publication of the legislation. He was 'naive to the point of folly' in
believing that this gesture would help him secure an agreement with Beijing,
the paper said.
However, Mr Patten's decision won approval from the Co-operative Resources
Centre (CRC), a conservative political grouping close to the colony's
business community and Beijing. Mrs Selina Chow, a leading CRC member, said
it was a 'hopeful sign' that talks might eventuate.
Hong Kong's Beijing-controlled press published conflicting reactions to Mr
Patten's decision. Ta Kung Pao, which is regarded as the most reliable
mouthpiece, published a tough commentary which laid down four conditions for
talks which appeared to British diplomats to be designed to prevent
dialogue.
It said Britain should agree to talks about the 1994-95 elections based on
past understandings; it should agree not to publish Mr Patten's bill until
agreement was reached; it should include no 'third party,' that is Hong
Kong, in the talks; and any agreement reached should be binding and unable
to be amended by 'area councils,' that is, the Legislative Council.
Wen Wei Po, in a softer commentary, said China had never insisted Britain
publicly withdraw Mr Patten's political blueprint. 'The British side can
have several ways to abandon the package, such as, putting it aside or
treating it as 'invisible' during the talks,' it said.

CHINA expects to sustain economic growth of about 8 per cent annually to the
end of this century. This would bring the Chinese economy within range of
becoming the world's biggest within two decades.
Mr Gan Ziyu, vice minister of the state planning commission, said yesterday
that China's goal of quadrupling 1980 gross national product by the year
2000 - a target that was decried by many economists when it was unveiled -
would be realised earlier.
China's extraordinary economic surge has forced a review of growth targets
in its current five-year plan (1991-95), which had envisaged growth of some
6 per cent annually.
Mr Gan, in a briefing with reporters, dismissed suggestions that the economy
was overheating, saying it would continue to grow in a quick-paced but
sustainable manner.
The Chinese official said the government would 'fine tune' the economy to
achieve sustainable rates of growth. This would be done by restricting
credit and restraining growth in the money supply.
China registered real GNP growth last year of more than 12 per cent,
exceeding both the planned 6 per cent for 1992 and the 9 per cent average of
the past 13 years. Economic activity shows little sign of slackening this
year.
China's economic boom - growth may have been much higher in 1992 than
officially acknowledged - has prompted a sharp debate within the Chinese
leadership about the dangers of renewed inflation caused by excessive
demand.
Bank lending increased last year by double the planned figure, money in
circulation doubled, and the broader measure of money supply (M2) charged
ahead by 28 per cent. Inflation in the large urban centres reached 14 per
cent compared with a national average of about 6 per cent.
Mr Gan, meanwhile, added that China planned to import an average of Dollars
70bn-Dollars 80bn annually of technology, machinery and raw materials in the
present five-year plan.

<DATELINE>
   SEOUL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kim Young-sam, the new South Korean president, yesterday appointed a
combination of bold political reformers and cautious economic bureaucrats to
his cabinet.
Many of the 24 ministers come from outside the political establishment. They
include academics and former opposition politicians who served with Mr Kim
before he joined the ruling Democratic Liberal Party in 1990. The reformers
mostly fill politically sensitive positions, such as head of the
intelligence agency, as part of Mr Kim's programme to remove the last
vestiges of the former military dictatorship.
The key economic agencies, however, are occupied by bureaucrats, who
indicated they will resist rapid economic deregulation.
'We will seek reforms in a gradual way that will not invite bad effects,'
said Mr Lee Kyung-shik, who becomes head of the Economic Planning Board. Mr
Lee was an EPB official and presidential adviser during the administration
of President Park Chung-hee, when economic policy was dominated by central
planning.
He then became a senior executive at Daewoo, the country's fourth biggest
conglomerate, during the 1980s and is now president of the state-run Korea
Gas Corporation.
Although he favours the reduction of bureaucratic controls on industry, he
added that he did not support 'the rash implementation of financial
deregulation'.
Mr Hong Jae-hyung is the new finance minister and a former bureaucrat in the
ministry. He is now chairman of the state-owned Korea Exchange Bank and was
the president of the Export and Import Bank, another government bank.
Mr Hong also favours a cautious approach to financial liberalisation and is
likely to resist foreign demands, particularly from the US, for more rapid
market-opening measures.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Singapore budget will cut taxes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE

<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE'S budget for 1993, announced yesterday, proposes big fiscal
changes, with a 3 point cut in corporation tax to 27 per cent and similar
cuts in personal taxes, with the top rate reduced from 33 to 30 per cent.
Dr Richard Hu, the finance minister, said the main thrust of the budget was
to maintain Singapore's competitiveness as an investment location while
encouraging Singaporeans to invest more in the region and develop an
external 'second pillar' for the economy.
'Our challenge is to claim a bigger piece of that fast growing economic pie
in the region,' said Dr Hu.
The incentives include tax credits for overseas dividend income and tax
exemptions for venture capital and regional investments funds. 'Individuals
will be encouraged to take part in risky but highly profitable ventures,
knowing that if they dare and succeed, government will not cream off a large
share of their rewards,' said Dr Hu.
Analysts said the government was clearly hoping that the tax cuts and a
range of additional benefits would reduce public concern about rising living
costs. Spending on medical and education schemes to benefit the poor is to
be substantially increased.
The government plans to introduce incentives to widen share ownership in the
run-up to the partial privatisation of the telecommunications utility later
this year. Singaporeans are also given a 5 per cent income tax rebate for
1993.
Dr Hu said a recently announced 3 per cent goods and services tax will only
partially make up for the drop in revenues resulting from the budget's tax
cuts and incentives package in the short to medium term.
Analysts say the budget reflects Singapore's confidence in its fiscal
position. Since 1987 Singapore has been running a budget surplus. 1993
revenues are estimated at SDollars 17.2bn (Pounds 7.3bn) while expenditure
is budgeted at SDollars 15.5bn.
Singapore's economy grew by 5.8 per cent last year. Up to 7 per cent growth
is expected this year.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Industrial production in Japan falls again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE JAPANESE economy's weakness was underlined yesterday by official figures
which show that industrial production is continuing to fall, while the
growth in bank lending remains sluggish.
Industrial production fell by 0.3 per cent in January from the previous
month to stand 7.6 per cent below its level in January last year, according
to a report from the industry ministry.
However the monthly rate of decline in industrial production has slowed
significantly since the autumn, when it was falling at a month-on-month rate
of 2.9 per cent.
The financial authorities regard industrial production as an important
indicator of the prospects for economic recovery. They believe it will reach
its trough this quarter, paving the way for a gradual pick-up in investment.
Meanwhile, bank lending is still growing at an extremely low rate. Japanese
banks' outstanding loans were 2.2 per cent up at the end of last year on the
year before, according to the Bank of Japan.
Mounting pressure on industrial companies to cut costs to boost
profitability was underlined by KDD, the telecommunications operator, which
announced plans to shed 800 jobs in the next five years to reduce it
workforce to 5,000. The company is just completing a programme to cut 1,000
jobs.
Earlier this week Nissan, the car maker, and NTT, Japan's main
telecommunications group, announced plans to cut 35,000 jobs within three
years.

THE US military said yesterday it was going ahead with plans eventually to
withdraw 3,000 troops from Somalia despite riots and gun battles that rocked
Mogadishu in the past four days, Reuter reports from Mogadishu.
But about 1,000 of those troops, now deployed in the southern city of
Kismayu where rival militia fought on Monday, would remain for some time,
army captain Ed Loomis said.
About 100 people have died in Kismayu this week, according to the French
medical aid agency, Medecins Sans Frontieres.
Earlier yesterday US military spokesman Colonel Fred Peck said the planned
troop pull-out was on schedule 'despite events in the past 72 hours'.
He was referring to violent protests in Mogadishu by supporters of warlord
Mohamed Farah Aideed, who accused the American-led forces of backing his
rival, Mohamed Said Hersi, known as Morgan. The US military denies the
charge.
The protests were followed by gun battles on Thursday between the
multinational forces and bandits in Mogadishu. There was a similar but brief
clash yesterday.
The violence, the worst since the task force started arriving in December to
stop bandits looting food aid, had forced Washington to delay the withdrawal
from Monday of the 3,000.
The US has about 18,000 troops in Somalia.
The rest of the Americans should be home by April, when the United Nations
is expected to have taken over command of the task force of troops from 23
nations.

THE PROBLEMS of rising unemployment in the industrialised world and the
sharp economic downturn in Germany and other continental European countries
are set to dominate today's informal meeting of Group of Seven finance
ministers in London.
According to officials who have prepared the meeting, the talks are expected
to see some tough questioning of Germany's tight monetary policy, Japan's
sharply rising trade surplus and the US attitude to trade and currencies in
an attempt to iron out obstacles to world economic growth.
Although Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and G7 host,
is satisfied that UK monetary and fiscal policies are contributing to global
growth, a Canadian government official yesterday said that the UK would be
warned against allowing its public sector borrowing requirement to continue
rising sharply.
'He has got to act on the fiscal side,' the official said.
But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, will be the centre of most
attention when the ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada begin their discussions.
The US wants its allies to give priority to growth, is anxious to revive G7
co-operation and wants a discussion of Russia's economic problems. It
believes that it will have more leverage in the talks following President
Bill Clinton's plan to cut the US budget deficit.
'I think the US will be in a substantially stronger position than it has
been in many years because it is putting its house in order, it is
responding to pressure from abroad, and its own economy is picking up,' a US
treasury official said.
For their part, America's allies want assurances that the Clinton
administration is not protectionist and that it will support the Uruguay
Round of trade liberalisation talks.
The impasse in the trade talks is regarded by some G7 officials as an
important factor that has undermined the group's credibility as a forum for
international co-operation.
The Japanese government will be seeking an explanation of Mr Bentsen's
recent comments in favour of a strong yen, which have been largely
responsible for the yen's sharp rise against the dollar over the past week.
Yesterday it signalled its mounting frustration with the US administration's
failure to clarify the remarks.
Speaking to the Japanese parliament, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
warned that a rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar could
'derange' the Japanese economy by hitting exporters.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, the outspoken minister of trade and industry, warned that
the yen's appreciation threatened to choke off what little growth was left
in the flagging Japanese economy.
Yesterday it appeared that the US would try to smooth over the row. Before
leaving Washington one of Mr Bentsen's officials called his comment 'an
off-hand remark'. He added that Mr Bentsen 'explicitly rejected a strategy
of driving down the dollar'.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Russian government seeks 10% export tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian government is demanding a new, 10 per cent tax on all exports in
an effort to raise funds to pay off the Dollars 80bn debt it inherited from
the former Soviet Union.
The demand is a measure of the desperate straits in which the government
finds itself - faced with massive tax evasion and a rapid fall in income as
production and living standards plummet.
Government estimates show that over the past year, a gap of between Dollars
10bn and Dollars 15bn opened up between the volume of goods exported and
what the government should have received in existing export taxes. At the
same time, the precipitous fall of the rouble against hard currencies has
meant that the government must now again subsidise imports, to the tune of
half of the credit created each month.
Russian exporters are already among the most heavily taxed traders in the
world. Non-payment of taxes through use of offshore accounts is common, thus
compounding the government's hard currency problems.

SYRIA said yesterday it would convene a meeting of Arab parties to the
Middle East peace process to discuss the resumption of negotiations, but
warned that a quick restart was unlikely without a solution to the
Palestinian deportees crisis.
Mr Farouk al-Shara, the Syrian foreign minister, said in Brussels that the
delegations to the stalled talks would be invited to Damascus 'within the
coming days or weeks' to discuss the invitation by Mr Warren Christopher, US
secretary of state, to reconvene bilateral talks with Israel in April.
Mr al-Shara said it would be 'wrong to think' that any Arab parties would
agree to resume negotiations until a 'satisfactory solution' had been found
to the impasse over 396 Palestinians who remain in south Lebanon after their
deportation by Israel in December. 'We in Syria insist on the return of all
the deportees,' he said.
The Syrian minister's remarks followed talks yesterday with several European
foreign ministers and Mr Christopher, who said Mr al-Shara had assured him
that Syria would back US attempts quickly to reconvene the peace talks.
Neither Syria nor any other Arab party has accepted the invitation to return
to the table by April, the date raised by Mr Christopher following his
week-long tour of Middle Eastern capitals.
Mr Christopher, in Brussels to attend a meeting of Nato ministers, said he
remained optimistic that talks could restart soon.
'I'm encouraged by developments since yesterday when the announcement was
made,' he said.
However, Mr Haider Abdel-Shafi, head of the Palestinian negotiating team,
added another note of caution from Jerusalem, saying that Mr Christopher's
decision to issue invitations for an April resumption were 'premature' in
the absence of a settlement to the deportees issue. His comments were echoed
by spokesmen from the Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters in
Tunis.
Nevertheless, senior Palestinian officials in Cairo said that a US proposal
to resolve the stalemate remained alive and offered hope for an acceptable
solution.

to see some tough questioning of Germany's tight monetary policy, Japan's
sharply rising trade surplus and the US attitude to trade and currencies in
an attempt to iron out obstacles to world economic growth.
Although Mr Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor of the exchequer and G7 host,
is satisfied that UK monetary and fiscal policies are contributing to global
growth, a Canadian government official yesterday said that the UK would be
warned against allowing its public sector borrowing requirement to continue
rising sharply.
'He has got to act on the fiscal side,' the official said.
But Mr Lloyd Bentsen, the US treasury secretary, will be the centre of most
attention when the ministers and central bank governors from the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada begin their discussions.
The US wants its allies to give priority to growth, is anxious to revive G7
co-operation and wants a discussion of Russia's economic problems. It
believes that it will have more leverage in the talks following President
Bill Clinton's plan to cut the US budget deficit.
'I think the US will be in a substantially stronger position than it has
been in many years because it is putting its house in order, it is
responding to pressure from abroad, and its own economy is picking up,' a US
treasury official said shortly before leaving Washington.
For their part, America's allies want assurances that the Clinton
administration is not protectionist and that it will support the Uruguay
Round of trade liberalisation talks.
The impasse in the trade talks is regarded by some G7 officials as an
important factor that has undermined the group's credibility as a forum for
international co-operation.
The Japanese government will be seeking an explanation of Mr Bentsen's
recent comments in favour of a strong yen, which have been largely
responsible for the yen's sharp rise against the dollar over the past week.
Yesterday it signalled its mounting frustration with the US administration's
failure to clarify the remarks.
Speaking to the Japanese parliament, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister,
warned that a rapid appreciation of the yen against the dollar could
'derange' the Japanese economy by hitting exporters.
Mr Yoshiro Mori, the outspoken minister of trade and industry, warned that
the yen's appreciation threatened to choke off what little growth was left
in the flagging Japanese economy.
Yesterday it appeared that the US would try to smooth over the row. Before
leaving Washington one of Mr Bentsen's officials called his comment 'an
off-hand remark'. He added that Mr Bentsen 'explicitly rejected a strategy
of driving down the dollar'.

GE Aircraft Engines, an arm of the General Electric Company and a major
supplier to commercial and military aircraft manufacturers, said yesterday
it was cutting its workforce by more than 10 per cent.
The move, another symptom of the poor health of the US aircraft industry,
follows heavy job cuts by Boeing last week.
GE Aircraft, which sells engines for air, marine, and industrial use, said
it would cut 3,900 from its workforce of 33,000. The cuts are planned across
operations, with about 2,500 at its headquarters in Evendale, Ohio; 700 at
its plant in Lynn, Massachusetts, and 700 at smaller facilities around the
US.
In addition to an airline slump, GE Aircraft is also feeling the effects of
recent US military budget cuts.
'Our commercial customers have suffered unprecedented losses in the last
three years, and engine and spare parts orders are down,' said Mr Brian
Rowe, president. 'Those difficulties and continually changing customer needs
require these cost actions,' he said.
The company said the reductions would be made as much as possible through
attrition and voluntary job elimination programmes.
GE Aircraft Engines had revenues of Dollars 7.368bn (Pounds 5.18bn) in 1992,
compared with General Electric's overall sales of Dollars 62.2bn. A General
Electric spokesman said GE Aircraft had operating earnings of Dollars 7.7m
in 1992.

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Federal Office of Labour yesterday announced that it had run out of
money to finance new job training schemes in Germany.
The announcement was greeted with dismay by politicians across the board,
with the opposition Social Democratic party warning that unemployment could
rise by a further 250,000 if such financing was cut off.
A total of DM9.9bn (Pounds 4.2bn) was supposed to be earmarked this year for
retraining 300,000 workers in the five east German states, and 60,000 in the
rest of Germany. But the federal department overseeing the scheme has run
out of money.
The spectre of rising unemployment in eastern Germany coincides with renewed
calls by IG Metall, Germany's giant engineering trade union, to step up
protests in the five eastern states next week against the decision by the
engineering employers to renege on a 26 per cent pay rise for 300,000 union
members.
Gesamtmetall, the employers' association, broke a contract with IG Metall
agreed in March 1991, which would have brought east German wages up to 82
per cent of their west German counterparts on April 1 of this year, even
though productivity is 30 per cent below, and unit labour costs 40 per cent
above west German levels.
However, in what might be first signs of a compromise, Mr Thomas Stach,
spokesman for employers in Thuringia, said there was a 'positive signal' in
talks with IG Metall. Talks broke down last week in the other four east
German states after Gesamtmetall said the contract was no longer relevant
because of deteriorating economic conditions in both eastern and western
Germany.
In Thuringia, Mr Bernhard Vogel, the state's prime minister, and other
senior officials, have supported a compromise which might involve amending
the timetable for reaching income parity with western Germany, due in April
1994, and the rate of wage rises.
Gesamtmetall's decision to opt out of the contract in the other east German
states was yesterday followed by an announcement from Nordmetall employers
in Saxony and Berlin-Brandenburg that they too were reneging on the
contract.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, told engineering workers in Jena on
Thursday that strike action in the east would be taken from April 1 if the
employers refused to pay the 26 per cent wage rise.
The premiers of Germany's 16 states yesterday started a weekend meeting
aimed at reaching consensus on a solidarity pact. They are discussing a
'federal consolidation programme,' primarily designed to finance
reconstruction of the east German states.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN steelmakers yesterday welcomed the agreement in Brussels on a broad
strategy to cut EC steel-producing capacity to help stabilise the steel
market.
As steel workers demonstrated against the threat of further plant closures
in the Ruhr, the heart of the country's steel industry, the manufacturers
expressed the hope that the deal would allow prices to be raised, and
therefore cover the costs of the most efficient producers.
However, they warned that the EC industry ministers had left undecided the
question of how to protect the market against cheap steel imports from
eastern Europe. And they called for a longer period of at least two years to
enable the industry to restructure.
Mr Ruprecht Vondran, president of the German steel federation, said the
decision would make it easier for efficient steel producers to cover their
costs in a stabilised market.
He said the one year set for the industry to put most of the proposed - but
still unallocated - capacity cuts into effect was too short. German
manufacturers estimated it would take at least two years to set aside funds
to provide compensation for unprofitable producers to leave the market.
With a decision expected this weekend from Krupp-Hoesch, the second largest
German steelmaker, on whether to close an integrated steelworks in Dortmund
or Rheinhausen, 1,500 workers demonstrated yesterday outside another
threatened plant - the Klockner-Werke works at Georgsmarienhutte.

TRADE officials are to make a fresh attempt to negotiate a Multilateral
Steel Agreement to eliminate trade barriers and phase out most subsidies.
After a two-day meeting this week, the officials agreed to meet again in
late March or early April to consider a revised text.
The officials said that there seemed to be a genuine will among the 30 or so
participants to reach an accord, following the breakdown of talks last
March, but that many delegations had no mandate to negotiate.
'Perhaps by the next meeting Washington will have got its act together,'
said one official, referring to the lack of policy guidance to US
negotiators from the still incomplete Clinton trade team.
The MSA, originally intended to govern world steel trade after the expiry of
'voluntary' export restraints to the US market last March, came to grief a
year ago over permissible subsidies and US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
actions.
Since then the discussions have been further complicated by swingeing US
anti-dumping and countervailing duties recently imposed on steel imports
from most foreign suppliers.
Yesterday, US officials held bilateral meetings with the EC and Brazil under
the Gatt disputes procedure.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Who's next in Italy's probe of corruption?: As more arrests
are made, it is feared democracy may be undermined
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALIAN magistrates investigating corruption seem to be systematically going
through the pages of Who's Who.
Each day brings a fresh list of well-known names who are either arrested or
wanted for questioning. And the momentum of investigation has begun to
quicken.
This week those under investigation have included Mr Giorgio La Malfa, head
of the Republican Party and Mr Raul Gardini, the most dashing Italian
entrepreneur of the 1980s. Those arrested included Mr Francesco Paolo
Mattioli, Fiat's chief financial officer, and Mr Giampiero Pesenti, who
controls Italy's biggest cement company.
But as the momentum quickens, there is a growing chorus of alarm among
politicians over the extent to which the spreading investigations -
involving magistrates in at least five major cities - is compromising the
Italian establishment. Politicians of all parties now freely admit the
political system is completely corrupted and that perhaps more than a third
of the current parliament could fall foul of the law.
Mr Giovanni Conso, a distinguished judge, and recently appointed minister of
justice, has argued that a solution must be found to prevent matters getting
out of hand. This week he announced his ministry was working on legislation
which would attempt to balance the need for justice with the need to prevent
democracy from being undermined by mass incrimination of the country's
leading politicians and businessmen.
But it is hard to see how parliament can legislate anything resembling a
pardon or amnesty in the present climate. This would risk not only
alienating public opinion but also creating a conflict between the judiciary
and the legislature.
The politicians believe the solution has to lie in a redefinition of what
constitutes illicit party finance and the penal consequences for who have
handled such funds. The main thread in all the investigations is that of
politicians receiving money from state or private companies allegedly to
finance their large party bureaucracies in return for business favours.
Mr Mino Martinazzoli, the Christian Democrat leader, this week favoured a
form of depenalising the illicit financing of political parties: 'I believe
robbery is always immoral but the violation of the laws on financing
political parties is not theft. It is an irregularity to which we have made
a crime with penal sanctions.' In other words obtaining funds illicitly and
not declaring them is a misdemeanour which should merit at best a fine.
Since the Christian Democrat party is the most exposed, along with its
coalition partners the Socialists, this attitude might seem self-serving.
His critics suggested such treatment was inconceivable either for
politicians who had forced companies to contribute to party coffers
(extortion) or where companies had paid over money to assure the award of a
contract.
Mr Achille Occhetto, leader of the former communist Party of the Democratic
Left (PDS) and a strong moraliser, also this week hinted at special
treatment for politicians who had taken money for their parties. But his
purpose was also self-seeking since the PDS and former communists caught up
in the investigation have all claimed they were working for the noble cause
of the party. Personal enrichment, he claimed, was a worse crime. 'At the
judicial level everyone is equal before the law. But on the moral level one
ought to make the distinction between those accused of having illegally
financed politics and those who have enriched themselves in politics.'
The magistrates themselves recognise the difficulties of dealing with an
ever increasing number of interrogations, and an ever larger pile of files
and indictments. One suggestion has been to ask all those who have paid or
received bribes over a certain figure since 1980 to come forward and declare
them. The monies would then be asked to be restituted, and where there was
damage to a third party, damages would have to be paid.

Serb commanders in Zvornik, eastern Bosnia, delayed the convoy, which makes

searching the 60 lorries, said a UN spokesman. Part of the convoy yesterday
remained in Zvornik, while 25 trucks returned to Belgrade.
Meanwhile Serb military leaders softened resistance to the planned US air
drop after the administration included Croat and Serb communities in the
operation. But Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnian Serb leader, said he was worried
Moslems would down one of the aircraft and blame it on Serbs to provoke US
military intervention.
Mr Dragomir Djukic, Yugoslav ambassador to the UN, said: 'No one can have
anything against bringing humanitarian help but they must be aware of the
risks of the situation. All three sides possess the means to down transport
planes.'

FT  27 FEB 93 / Bulgarians in deal with Efta
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BULGARIA yesterday became the latest eastern European country to conclude a
free trade agreement with the seven members of the European Free Trade
Association. The pace, which covers free trade in industrial goods,
processed farm goods, fish and other marine products, will be signed this
spring and come into effect on July 1 after ratification.
The agreement with Bulgaria took just three months to negotiate. Like the
accords Efta has already reached with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Poland,
Romania and Hungary, it is 'asymmetric'; the rich Efta members will
dismantle their trade barriers faster, leaving Bulgaria until December 2002
to phase out tariffs and other restrictions.
The agreement has been accompanied by bilateral deals between Bulgaria and
Efta members on liberalising trade in farm goods where there is no common
Efta-wide trade regime equivalent to the European Community's Common
Agricultural Policy.
Bulgaria's exports to Efta countries amounted to Dollars 93m in 1991, while
imports totalled over Dollars 220m.
Efta is increasingly regarded as a 'half-way house' to EC membership for
central and eastern European nations. All Efta's current members except
Switzerland will be part of the giant free trade zone known as the European
Economic Area which is due to come into force next July. On Thursday Efta
and EC negotiators agreed on a compromise financial formula which will clear
the way for the EEA, although the revised treaty must still be ratified by
18 national parliaments.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Switzerland's regional banks continue to feel the squeeze: A
persistent inverted yield curve has led to a spate of mergers and takeovers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PERHAPS one reason why the Swiss do so well in business is that they do not
hesitate to be blunt - even cruelly, publicly blunt - with each other.
Recently Mr Markus Lusser, president of the Swiss National Bank,
demonstrated this quality anew at Biel where he went to address the leaders
of the country's 160 regional banks.
It is no secret that many of Switzerland's regional banks are in trouble.
One went spectacularly bust a year-and-a-half ago, creating what no one ever
expected to see in this country, a queue of deposit holders vainly waiting
to get their money back.
Most of the rest of these small, locally rooted banks have been badly
squeezed by an inverted yield curve that prevailed in Switzerland for nearly
two years, leading to a spate of mergers and takeovers.
Now, just as the sector's leaders are beginning to see light at the end of
the tunnel, Mr Lusser has come along and blocked the exit.
It was not enough to design a strategy for recovery, he said. Instead,
regional bank managers should ask themselves whether, given the chance, they
would start up afresh in the present climate. If not, they should look
around for a merger partner or go into voluntary liquidation.
Not surprisingly, regional bankers were upset. 'It was not very sensible to
talk like that. He said nothing positive,' Mr Roland Boeschenstein, deputy
director of the Association of Regional Banks, says.
The regional banks do not figure large in the overall scheme of Swiss
banking; their combined assets of SFr84bn (Pounds 38bn) at the end of last
year were roughly a third the size of those of Union Bank of Switzerland,
the country's largest.
But they see themselves as pillars of local communities, with a better
understanding of local needs than the big universal banks. 'Swiss people
like to deal with a bank they can feel comfortable talking to,' Mr
Boeschenstein says.
Others suggest that this is a nostalgic view. Mr Beat Philipp, banking
analyst at Bank J. Vontobel in Zurich, argues that the regional banks have
lost their role. 'The problem is that social structures have changed. People
still live in the villages, but they work and bank in the cities.'
Mr Michel Petitpierre, head of research at Pictet &amp; Co in Geneva, adds that
many regional banks themselves broke ties with their local communities in
the 1980s, aspiring to lend to bigger businesses. And that is how some,
including the Spar und Leihkasse Thun, which went bust in October 1991, got
into trouble.
Even if most of the regional banks did fold, Switzerland would not, like
Britain and some other countries, become virtually bereft of locally
controlled financial institutions outside the capital.
The country has a full network of cantonal banks, mortgage and small
business specialists whose assets are backed in whole or in part by their
cantonal governments. They still account for about a fifth of all financial
institutions' assets and are growing.
And there is a surprisingly buoyant network of 1,158 Raiffeisen, village
co-operative banks that work on a very intimate and careful basis with local
farmers and tradespeople.
The regional banks have seen their assets fall from SFr93.5bn in 1990 to
SFr84bn last year. But Raiffeisen assets jumped from SFr33.8bn to SFr36.7bn
in 1991, and the group's association says they grew again last year.
'I doubt that many people would cry over the disappearance of the regional
banks,' Mr Philipp says.

FT  27 FEB 93 / US wins Nato support for Bosnia aid plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER

<TEXT>
THE US yesterday won its Nato allies' political support for its decision to
parachute humanitarian supplies to besieged Moslem enclaves in Bosnia, but
failed to get any offers of concrete aid for the operation, expected to
start this weekend, except from Turkey.
Making his first appearance at a Nato ministerial meeting since his
appointment as US secretary of state, Mr Warren Christopher said he was
nevertheless 'gratified and encouraged' by the support he had received from
his fellow ministers.
'I didn't come here for the purpose of asking for their aid and I was not at
all disappointed by the response I received,' he maintained.
Both Mr Christopher and a number of allied foreign ministers, including Mr
Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, went out of their way to stress
that the US and European humanitarian aid efforts in Bosnia should be seen
as 'supplementary' and not rival policies.
But this did not prevent a certain amount of mutual irritation from creeping
into their assessments of the situation in the former Yugoslavia.
Mr Christopher clearly continues to feel that the European nations are not
pulling their weight in the search for a Bosnian peace settlement.
The recent decision by the US to participate in the peace negotiations in
New York, chaired by Mr Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen, 'comes with the
expectation that Europe, which is most directly affected, will play a
leading role and redouble its concerted efforts,' he told his fellow
ministers. 'The addition of the US should certainly not occasion any
relaxation by others.'
Official and media criticism of European policy in Bosnia goaded Mr Hurd
into once again underlining the extent of the British and French
humanitarian aid efforts in Bosnia. British troops had escorted 279 convoys
carrying 20,000 tonnes of supplies to distressed areas of Bosnia, he said.
Mr Christopher also called on the alliance to make preparations 'now' on
measures to enforce a peace settlement once it is reached, pointing out that
the Vance-Owen plan did not provide for the means required to ensure its
implementation. 'We must be ready to act effectively if and when a viable
agreement is accepted by all the warring sides.'
He reiterated his promise that the US was ready to join with the United
Nations, the European Community, Nato and 'others' in implementing a peace
agreement, including 'possible US military participation'.
Nato's special capabilities and command structure could play a key role in
such a joint operation, together with contributions from non-allies, Mr
Christopher said.
Russia said earlier this week that it was ready to co-operate with Nato in a
force to implement a peace agreement, which experts estimate will require at
least 60,000 peace-keeping troops.
Mr Roland Dumas, the French foreign minister, said France would propose the
nomination of a special UN co-ordinator for the aid and military operation
to implement a peace agreement.
Though Yugoslavia took up much of the ministers' time, Mr Christopher also
made a ringing declaration on the new US administration's fidelity to the
Nato alliance and its support for 'a strong and integrated Europe'.
President Clinton intended to pursue a policy of 'total diplomacy', which
viewed domestic and foreign issues as inseparable, he said. 'We recognise
that only an America that is strong at home can act as an effective partner
abroad.'
The three pillars on which America's 'total diplomacy' would rest were:
elevating the US's economic security to a primary foreign policy goal,
updating US forces and security arrangements to meet new threats and
organising US foreign policy to help promote the spread of democracy and
free markets abroad.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Norway to resume scientific whaling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LOFOTEN, NORWAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY said yesterday it would resume scientific whaling in April and begin
commercial whaling by the end of May, or in June.
At the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission last year in
June, Norway announced that it would resume commercial whaling in 1993 after
a break of five years.
Mr Jan Henry T. Olsen, Norway's minister of fisheries, said quotas for
commercial whaling would be set after the next IWC meeting which is
scheduled to be held in May in Kyoto, Japan. He said the quota was likely to
be in the range of a 'few hundred' north-east Atlantic minke whales.
Mr Olsen expressed optimism that the IWC would lift its whaling moratorium,
but warned that Norway would be forced to reconsider its status as an IWC
member if the ban was to prevail.
In 1992, the IWC's scientific committee unanimously agreed that the best
estimate of the north-east Atlantic stock of minke whales was 86,700, and
that this stock is no longer in danger of depletion.
Professor Lars Walloe, head of Norway's scientific whale research programme,
explained yesterday that last year 95 whales were caught as part of a
three-phase programme under which a quota of 400 minke whales will be killed
for scientific reasons during 1992-1994.
This year, under the the second phase of the programme 136 minke whales
would be killed in mid-April and later in the autumn. The remaining
scientific quota would be fulfilled next year. Professor Walloe said the
purpose of this year's catch would be to study the eating habits of the
minke whale during the spring and autumn.
In sub-arctic north Norway, where about 400,000 people, or one-tenth of the
population live, most communities depend on fishing for their livelihood.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Wilkinson Sword in likely sale to US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARNER-LAMBERT, the US pharmaceuticals and consumer products group, is in
advanced negotiations to buy Wilkinson Sword, the razors and toiletries
company put up for sale last year.
It is understood that Warner-Lambert and Eemland, the Dutch-registered
consortium of international investors which owns Wilkinson, aim to conclude
negotiations early next month. Although a price has yet to be agreed, it is
likely to be well below the Dollars 300m (Pounds 211m) which Eemland had
hoped to achieve.
Warner-Lambert owns Schick, the second-largest US wet shaving products
company. Acquisition of Wilkinson would give Schick a stronger base for
European expansion and could provide keener competition for Gillette, the US
company which dominates the world razor business.
In Europe, Schick sells mainly in France and the Benelux countries. It has
small market sales in Germany and Britain. Schick is also the leading
supplier in Japan, the only country where it is ahead of Gillette.
A deal would mark the fifth change of ownership since 1980 for Wilkinson
Sword, which Eemland acquired from Stora, the Swedish forest products group,
in a heavily leveraged buy-out five years ago. Eemland's main shareholders
include a group of Scandinavian banks and insurance companies, JP Morgan,
the US bank, and Gillette. Wilkinson was put up for sale in October, partly
because the Scandinavian shareholders were not prepared to inject further
capital.
In addition, Gillette has been ordered by the European Commission and
anti-trust authorities in the UK and several other countries to end its
involvement in Eemland on the grounds that it is anti-competitive.
Gillette has a 22 per cent non-voting stake in the consortium and has
extended it a loan worth more than Dollars 100m on onerous terms and at an
exceptionally high rate of interest. Eemland's debt is believed to total
several hundred million dollars.
Eemland's shareholders have agreed to sell Wilkinson with a debt-free
balance sheet and share its financial liabilities between them.
Wilkinson had operating profits of DM46.8m (Pounds 19.8m) on sales of
DM316.3m in 1991. Its financial performance is understood to have
deteriorated sharply since then, partly because of heavy marketing to
support a razor system launched last spring.
Wilkinson sells its products in the European Community and has a small
loss-making business in the US. Gillette has also agreed, under pressure
from anti-trust authorities, to hand back rights to the Wilkinson brand in
central and eastern Europe.

FT  27 FEB 93 / OFT to conduct inquiry into office equipment leasing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDE-RANGING inquiry into the hiring and leasing of office equipment was
announced by the Office of Fair Trading yesterday. It follows allegations of
malpractice and high-pressure sales techniques, particularly in the
photocopier market.
Sir Bryan Carsberg, director-general of fair trading, said he was launching
an investigation because complaints about selling practices had continued
despite earlier attempts to improve standards.
The OFT, which can investigate the activities of individual companies and
can revoke their consumer credit licences, will also examine the supply of
postal franking and vending machines.
Sir Bryan said his office would examine sales methods, the nature, length
and clarity of leasing contracts, the effectiveness of existing consumer
protection laws and self-regulation.
Investigations will also centre on the relationship - criticised as
anti-competitive - between equipment suppliers, the dealers and supporting
finance and leasing companies.
Earlier this week, Southern Business Group, the publicly quoted photocopier
leasing company, disclosed resignations and sackings after it admitted
'improprieties' in dealings with some customers. It said then it would
welcome an OFT investigation of the sector.
Last year, the OFT decided against revoking licences from the office
equipment supplier Eurocopy following assurances about some of its business
practices. Mr Cyril Gay, chairman of Eurocopy, last night welcomed the
inquiry.
Sir Bryan said that complaints to the OFT suggested numerous cases of
'misrepresentation and sharp practice', most noticeably involving
photocopying leases. Initial OFT inquiries, he added, 'tend to confirm this
view'.
The Campaign to Clean Up Copier Contracts, which has logged more than 3,000
complaints from photocopier customers and has pressed for OFT intervention,
said the decision was a breakthrough.
A campaign spokesman said it would 'bring hope to the 250,000 cost-per-copy
customers' who had been caused misery and distress by leasing companies
which had enforced contracts signed under false pretences'.
The campaign has submitted to the OFT a dossier of complaints, involving
more than 50 photocopier dealers and leasing companies, some of them owned
by large, London-based financial institutions.
Mr Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, also welcomed the
move. However, he criticised the OFT for acting slowly, and claimed that its
inaction had cost photocopier customers millions of pounds.
Allegations made by customers involve the use of flexible business
agreements which obscure expensive obligations. contracts running well
beyond the working life of the equipment and which include hidden increases
in copy costs.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Scottish yard cuts most of its workforce
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
McDERMOTT, the US owner of the Ardersier offshore fabrication yard near
Inverness, one of northern Scotland's biggest employers, is to make most of
its remaining 500 workers redundant, Andrew Taylor writes.
The yard, which employed 3,500 workers 18 months ago, will run out of work
on Monday when it is due to complete a contract for part of a North Sea
production platform.
McDermott says that Ardersier will then move to 'little more than care and
maintenance'. The yard is expected to employ only about 75 people by the
beginning of April. More than half of the jobs are to go next week.
The redundancies are the latest in a series in yards in Scotland and
north-east England. This month the Offshore Manufacturers' and Constructors'
Association estimated that the number of workers employed by offshore
fabricators, including sub-contractors, had halved to 10,000 since
September.
Manufacturers are forecasting a further 3,000 job losses in the next few
months as investment in North Sea exploration continues to dwindle.
McDermott insisted it was maintaining its commitment to the yard in which it
invested Pounds 25m in 1986.

CHELTENHAM &amp; Gloucester and Nationwide building societies are cutting
investment rates from Monday. They are also offering mortgage rates of 4 per
cent. At C&amp;G, cuts are between 0.8 and 0.61 of a percentage point on gross
rates. The flat rate on the London Share account is dropping from 7 per cent
gross to 6.25; the London Deposit account's top tier of Pounds 25,000 and
over will pay 7.2 instead of 8. The Flexi-Tessa rate is 6.85, down from 7.5,
but the new Best 90 account is unaffected. It is paying 7.55 on the bottom
tier of Pounds 10,000 and up to 8.55 on balances of Pounds 100,000.
Nationwide's top tier of CashBuilder (Pounds 25,000 and above) will pay 5.6
per cent gross instead of 6.2. Rates on CapitalBuilder are now 6.3 on the
top tier of Pounds 50,000 and above. There are also interest rate and
overdraft reductions on Flexaccount, the interest-bearing current account.
*****
FIRST-time buyers at C&amp;G are being offered a mortgage of 4 per cent fixed
(8.1 apr) until February 28 next year. The mortgage then reverts to C&amp;G's
standard variable rate, now 7.99. It is available on interest-only and
repayment mortgages for a minimum deposit of 10 per cent.
The maximum loan is Pounds 70,000 and application fee is Pounds 50. If you
redeem in the first three years, the mortgage will be treated as though you
had taken out the loan at the standard rate.
Nationwide is selling off up to 1,500 of its repossessed properties for a
similarly reduced rate. Buyers will be offered a fixed rate of 4.25 per cent
for two years (7.8 apr) and a free valuation. You have to put down a 10 per
cent deposit and take out the society's payment cover policy for the
fixed-rate period. The arrangement fee is Pounds 50. There are no early
redemption penalties.
*****
SCOTTISH Amicable reduced payouts on 10-year with-profits policies by more
than 15 per cent this week, from Pounds 7,331 to Pounds 6,174 (based on a
male, aged 29 at outset, paying Pounds 30 per month in premiums). Roy
Nicholson, managing director, said cuts were caused by the group's
investment focus on small company shares, which had suffered in the
recession. However, this factor had little effect on longer-term policies;
accordingly, 25-year policies are being reduced by just 4.7 per cent, from
Pounds 62,543 to Pounds 59,602. The payouts represent annual returns of 10.4
per cent for the 10-year policies and 13 per cent for 25 years.
*****
It was another good week for small company shares. The County Small
Companies Index rose 0.3 per cent from 1051.95 to 1055.57 in the week to
February 25 while the Hoare Govett index (capital gains version) increased
0.2 per cent from 1346.28 to 1349.05 over the same period.

FT  27 FEB 93 / International Company News: European airlines to set up
talks for global system
</HEADLINE>

FOUR European airlines - KLM, Swissair, Scandinavian Air System and Austrian
Airlines - said yesterday they were ready to launch detailed talks on the
feasibility of setting up a 'global airline system'.
The airlines, which disclosed in late January they were considering opening
formal talks, said they planned to examine how a possible partnership could
be structured and how long it might take to get off the ground.
They declined to give details or to say whether an equity link was likely,
but indicated that all options remained open. Joint working groups have been
set up to explore opportunities in more detail.
'A combined effort is essential to compete profitably with the current and
anticipated heavy pressure on the European airline business from strong
intercontinental airlines,' the four companies said in a joint statement.
The partnership would be based on several European hubs, enabling traffic to
be funnelled in and out of the airlines' home countries. The airlines said
their ambition was to offer a global route network for passengers and cargo
traffic.
The move forward into official negotiations comes exactly a year after the
breakdown of merger talks between KLM and British Airlines, which has gone
on to take a 25 per cent stake in Qantas of Australia and to pursue a
minority shareholding in USAir, the sixth-largest US carrier.
Since the collapse of the BA talks, KLM - which owns a minority stake in
Northwest of the US - has been searching for ways to boost its global and
its European presence.
Swissair, SAS and Austrian Airlines are already partners in a loose grouping
called the European Quality Alliance, which involves joint marketing
activities and flight time-tables.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Travel Focus (France): Taking the waters in Aix-le-Bains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN COURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLAYER ran a few paces along the gravel and flicked his boule through
the air in a fierce arc. The steel ball glinted in mid-flight before
plummeting on to a nest of boules, one of which cannoned into the board at
the edge of the playing area. The player smiled and applause broke out among
the several thousand spectators.
Under the floodlights, half a dozen matches were taking place. The
competitors, many dressed in matching shell-suits, either catapulted their
deliveries or knelt to roll the boule with a care bordering on tenderness.
They seemed oblivious to the rain cascading into the marquee, or the gale
buffeting the flaps.
Taking refuge from the downpour, we had gate-crashed the national French
four-a-side boules championships in Aix-les-Bains, taking place by the side
of the beautiful Lac du Bourget. The surrounding village of tents, selling
the local Savoy wines, food, or beer and pastis to quench the thirst of the
fans, was a quagmire. Overnight, the temperature had dropped from 31``C to
13`C.
The day before, we had taken a pleasure boat across Lac du Bourget -
France's largest lake - to the Abbaye Royale at Hautecombe, which has a
magnificent position on a small headland jutting into the water. The abbey,
part of which dates from the 12th century, is the burial place of the counts
of the duchy of Savoy. The duchy was part of the kingdom of Sardinia for a
time but was incorporated into France in 1860.
We sailed from the Grand Port at Aix-les-Bains, where an elegant arch of
plane trees on the waterfront esplanade gave shelter from the sun. Swans,
coots and mallards fought over the crusty pickings of baguettes thrown from
the shore by picnickers. We disembarked by a stone boathouse, centuries old.
Until recently, the abbey - restored in the 19th century - was run by the
Benedictines; now, a Christian charismatic community has taken it over. In
its cool and quiet, we were given hand-held radio sets which, like an unseen
guide, directed us past murals and white statues.
There is a cafe in the garden next to the abbey, overlooking the lake
towards Aix-les-Bains. A woman from the community brought our drinks and
stayed talking for a while. 'The climate is changing,' she told us. 'Certain
kinds of flowers have stopped growing.' We were relieved to hear that she
also was waiting for what she called the 'fraicheur' (coolness) to arrive.
And, the following day, arrive it did.
Deluges apart, Lac du Bourget and the surrounding flat-topped mountains have
much to offer. There are plenty of water sports and rock-climbing: on a walk
through the forest past the foot of the sheer cliffs we passed groups of
climbers, including a family where the father was coaxing his young son up
the rock face. And there is hang-gliding. We saw gliders almost motionless,
thousands of feet up in the hot sky, buoyed by the lake thermals.
Although there is little snow in winter - there is a micro-climate by the
lake which makes bananas grow - resorts such as Grenoble and Albertville are
not far. We found good walks, often with exhilarating views, around the lake
although some required us to tramp along roads. The paths weaved through
thick woods of pine, oak and beech, meadows, and villages with
small-holdings growing grapes, pumpkins, corn, aubergines, walnuts and
fruit. Not so exhilarating were the loud and unfriendly German Shepherds
that guarded almost every house and farm.
The dry grass of the meadows was dotted with delicate alpine flowers. It
also seethed and rustled with cicadas, small lizards and much else besides,
including a snake with bilious green spots.
A swim in the lake was a good way to cool off at the end of a hot day's
hiking. There is an entry fee for the beach in Aix-les-Bains, at the Petit
Port. But at Chatillon, at the quiet northern end of the lake close to the
picturesque Savieres canal that links up with the river Rhone, the beach was
free and the water warm, if rather slimy underfoot.
The chief claim to fame of Aix-les-Bains is its thermal baths, fed by hot
springs. The earliest baths date from Roman times but the modern ones are
situated at the top of the town in a vast building, drearily imposing and
reminiscent of the Great Hall of the People in Beijing.
In the footsteps of Bonaparte and Queen Victoria, not to mention Verlaine
and the 50,000 French who take the waters annually on their national health
service, I decided to try the thermal plunge. My wife abstained. The smell
of sulphur grew stronger and stronger in the wide, marbled corridors and
stairways where the curistes - the receptionist referred tartly to me, a
once-off user, as a touriste - rested on sun-loungers. Afterwards, I felt
both refreshed and enervated. The whiff of sulphur remained on my skin for
the rest of the day.
Before leaving, we heard that the Aix-les-Bains team had won the boules
championship. Perhaps the water had something to do with it.

FT  27 FEB 93 / Finance and the Family: Own your home tax-free - Caroline
Garnham ends her series on property and the Inland Revenue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CAROLINE GARNHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU ARE not domiciled in the UK, you will not pay tax on any income or
property which you earn or own outside the country. But if you buy a house
or property in Britain, you could become liable to UK tax on the money
needed for the purchase; on any profit made when you sell it; or if you die
while owning it.
There are, however, legitimate ways of avoiding these levies.
If you need to bring in money to buy a house, the best way is to do this
before you become UK-resident; then, no tax is due. But if you cannot, there
are ways of converting a fund mixed with untaxed income and gains into one
that is non-taxable. Examples include setting up a back-to-back loan, making
a gift offshore, or creating an offshore trust.
If you have brought in substantial sums of money from a mixed fund, you
could be liable to tax already - although it could be difficult to work out
how much. In my experience, however, the Inland Revenue is fair in such
circumstances and often willing to negotiate if you co-operate.
Once you have decided how to buy your house, you should consider whether you
will have to pay capital gains tax if you profit from selling it. If you
plan to live there, it could be exempt from tax as your main or only
residence. But if you have another residence, anywhere else in the world,
you should ask the Revenue to treat your new house as your tax-exempt
residence. This request should be made within two years of buying the
property; after that, the Revenue could decide not to accept your choice.
If the exemption is not available, you might consider buying the property
through a non-UK trust. CGT is not charged on gains made by an offshore
trust set up by a non-UK domiciled settlor.
The next thing to consider is inheritance tax. If you are going to buy the
house in your own name, or in the name of an offshore trust, then
inheritance tax at a maximum rate of 40 per cent will be payable when you
die unless you leave the property to your spouse.
If you decide not to do this, or are concerned that you and your spouse
could die together, you can take out term insurance, especially if your stay
in the UK is unlikely to be long - say, five years at the most.
If this solution fails to suit, you can avoid IHT simply by owning the house
through an offshore company. You will then effectively have swapped a UK
chargeable asset (your house) for a non-UK, non-chargeable asset (shares) in
the offshore company.
In theory, this solution is simple but, in practice, there are
disadvantages. You must not, for example, be seen to be managing or
controlling the company from Britain. If you do, you will make it
UK-resident and defeat the purpose.
Another pitfall is an income tax charge under the benefit-in-kind
legislation. The Revenue has said it will levy tax if you live in a property
owned by an offshore company if you are either a director (either in name or
in effect) or own it. Tax charged is particularly onerous and is based on
the cost of the house (if over Pounds 75,000) and the rate of interest at
the time.
Many tax experts believe the Revenue is wrong to levy this charge; but while
the threat is there it should, where possible, be avoided. This usually can
be achieved by not being a director of the company and transferring your
shares in the company to an offshore trust.
Again, care must be taken over the trust to which you transfer your shares.
If you use an existing trust containing accumulated income, you might find
yourself being taxed on that income because of the benefit to you of the UK
accommodation.
If you want to let the house, the rental income will be taxable since it
arises in the UK. This can be avoided by taking out a loan from a UK bank
(or an offshore branch of a UK bank - but not a building society) to buy the
property.
The interest can then be set off against the rent and the money which,
otherwise, you would have used to buy the property can be deposited
offshore, generating an income which will be tax-free because it is outside
the UK.
There are many ways of avoiding tax, even on UK-situated assets, if you are
not domiciled in Britain. But make certain you are not - otherwise you could
face a larger tax bill than if you had done nothing at all.

FT  26 FEB 93 / International Company News: Amgen warning hits biotech
shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BIOTECHNOLOGY stocks staggered under a second blow in three days after
Amgen, a benchmark biotechnology company, warned late Wednesday that its
first-quarter earnings would fall as much as 15 per cent below analysts'
expectations.
The news sent biotech shares tumbling across the board. Amgen plunged
Dollars 9 1/4 to a 52-week low of Dollars 37, Chiron lost Dollars  1/2 to
Dollars 48 3/4 after dropping to Dollars 45 earlier in the day, US
Healthcare dropped Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 43, and Synergen, which
triggered a sell-off in the sector on Monday, lost Dollars  1/4 to Dollars
14 3/4 .
Xoma edged Dollars  1/4 lower to Dollars 8 1/4 while Centocorp held steady
at Dollars 6 1/4 . The lack of movement was a reflection of the heavy losses
already suffered by the stock rather than a vote of renewed confidence in
the company.
Centocorp traded as high as Dollars 60 1/4 last year, while Xoma has fallen
from a high of Dollars 25 1/4 .
Amgen blamed its disappointing forecast on unexpectedly slow sales of its
Neupogen cancer drug. Although sales of Neupogen have risen about 30 per
cent in the year, the company and Wall Street had expected a stronger
performance.
The news came on the heels of Monday's report by Synergen, a Colorado-based
drug developer, that research data on its Antril sepsis drug did not match
earlier trials.
Biotechnology stocks, like other healthcare issues, have suffered from
investor concern that the Clinton administration's healthcare policy will
lead to lower drug prices. Two biotechnology initial public offerings were
also postponed yesterday in what was speculated to be a reaction to worries
about healthcare policy, and although a softening new-issues market.
was also cited.
But the sagas of Synergen, Amgen, Centocorp and Xoma underscore an inherent
vulner ability in the biotechnology sector, where investors speculate on the
future earning per formance of products which are either in development or
only recently approved for marketing.
Synergen, whose stock plummeted Dollars 28 5/8 - or 68 per cent - on Monday,
was believed to have the most promising treat ment for septicaemia, an
often-lethal blood infection which afflicts about 1m Americans and Europeans
each year.
Earlier studies of Antril had shown it reduced death by 40 per cent to 60
per cent.
However, the company's latest study, involving a much larger number of
patients, indicated that a high dose of the drug reduced mortality by only
15 per cent.
Synergen is not the first biotech company to stumble in its search for a
treatment for sepsis. Both Centocorp and Xoma faltered after their
once-promising drugs proved less effective than initial studies had
indicated. Neither Centocorp nor Xoma have received marketing approval for
their sepsis drugs.
In the case of Amgen, the company already has two effective drugs on the
market. But Amgen's future success as a drugs company depends largely on
broadening its product line and the funding for future research will, to a
large degree, depend on the sales of Neupogen.

The House of Warburg must be feeling pretty pleased with itself because of
its role in the ICI demerger.
Leaving aside the accolades that will be heaped on a couple of S G Warburg
directors, John Walker-Haworth and Rory Tapner, for earning the firm some
very fat fees, Warburg can also point with pride to Goldman Sachs' Jon
Aisbitt, the other financial adviser. He honed his early merchant banking
skills at Warburg.
And don't forget John Mayo, finance director of Zeneca, the demerged drug
company - who just happens to have been recruited from Warburg. If only
ICI's Sir Denys Henderson had not decided to hog both chairmanships, it
might have been possible to find a job for Warburg chairman Sir David
Scholey. But then again that might have been just a little too incestuous.

DALMIA, one of India's largest private companies, yesterday moved closer to
establishing a bigger foothold in Europe following its purchase of a
cellulose and paper mill in the eastern German state of Thuringia, writes
Judy Dempsey in Berlin.
The purchase of Zellstoff-und Papierfabrik Rosenthal, which was arranged by
the Treuhand, the agency responsible for the privatisation of east German
industry, coincided with the visit by Chancellor Helmut Kohl to south-east
Asia.
The enterprise, which has an annual production capacity of 150,000 tons of
sulphite and cellulose, and 6,000 tons for paper production, last year
achieved a turnover of DM153m (Pounds 64.8m). Traditionally, its turnover
was earned on the domestic market, but following a restructuring, which cost
DM46m, sales to west European countries now account for 90 per cent of
turnover.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government is coming under growing pressure to rule on the
granting of concessions for 62 new local TV stations, which are reported to
have gone to Televisa, Latin America's largest media company.
Award of the concessions to Televisa would enable it to complete its third
national network in Mexico, but threatens to complicate the sell-off of
Mexico's state-owned TV channels 7 and 13, due to take place by June.
Televisa already has about 80-90 per cent of Mexico's TV audience, and
further expansion would make it much harder for the buyers of the two
state-owned channels to compete.
Newspaper reports have suggested the two state channels might fetch Dollars
500m. They would provide the only effective competition to Televisa, a
self-proclaimed supporter of Mexico's ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, in power for the past 63 years.
One of the favoured bidders for the state-owned channels said: 'The
government does not realise the importance of this. If they make the
concessions it will be very difficult to compete. The most important part
(of the privatisation) is the rules of future competition. We are obviously
concerned.'
Televisa has all but announced that it has been awarded the concessions. A
spokesman said: 'We expect an announcement soon.' been promised the
concessions. A communications ministry spokesman said a decision had still
to be made.
The government will soon have to confront Televisa's 'Plan Amigo', which
gives free advertising spots to companies promising not to advertise
elsewhere. Given Televisa's dominance of the TV market, the arrangement may
make it hard for future competitors to entice advertisers away.

FT  26 FEB 93 / IG Metall to assist unions in east Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S IG Metall, the biggest and most powerful union in Europe, has
announced a programme of assistance for the weak and divided unions of
eastern Europe to support economic and social 'fair play' in those
countries.
The union has described the assistance programme as the biggest solidarity
initiative in its history.
With some assistance from the European Commission it will be spending about
DM2m (Pounds 800,000) on support for trade unionists in Hungary, Poland,
Romania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Russia, Belarus and the
Ukraine.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, head of IG Metall, said that his union and the East
European unions had a common interest in seeing the gap in the standard of
living between western and eastern Europe closed as quickly as possible.
'We need to act together to stop governments and inward investors playing us
off against each other,' he said.
The first bilateral agreement has been signed between IG Metall and the
Hungarian Metalworkers Union, Vasas, which provides for training Vasas
officials, visits to Germany, and close German-Hungarian union co-operation
when German multinationals set up plants in Hungary.
The IG Metall initiative is also designed to reduce competition between
reformed 'old' unions and new unions. In the Czech and Slovak republics the
unions have broken completely with their past but in Hungary there is still
tension between old and new unions.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Finns learn to live with sacrifices: Economy faces painful
truths
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BROWN-HUMES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPILE a list of the ailments inflicting west European economies right now,
and it will soon be apparent that few countries are in a worse condition
than Finland.
'We have lost our eastern market, our western market and our domestic
market,' says Mr Tarmo Valkonen, the head of forecasting at the Research
Institute of the Finnish Economy.
Record unemployment, massive foreign debt, international recession, huge
banking losses, and the collapse of trade with the former Soviet Union are
the key symptoms and causes of a crisis which has seen GDP shrink by 10 per
cent over the last two years - more than it did in the depression of the
1930s.
As if things were not bad enough, the Finns have had more bad news in recent
days.
Kansallis-Osake-Pankki, the country's leading commercial bank, has predicted
negative 1993 GDP growth of 0.5 per cent, reversing last autumn's forecast
of 1.5 per cent growth.
The Ministry of Finance has also just scaled down its previous forecast of 2
per cent growth to zero, partly because of continuing recession in many key
export markets.
'We are in an acute crisis, the worst crisis in decades. And the recession
elsewhere in Europe is making matters worse,' said Mr Sixten Korkman,
director-general of the Ministry of Finance.
Finland is paying the price for its over-dependence on a single export
market - the former Soviet Union - and over-reliance on one particular
sector - forestry.
However, it is also undergoing a painful period of readjustment after the
boom years during the 1980s when the property and share markets became
grossly over-heated.
A total of 18.6 per cent of the workforce is now out of work and many
economists predict the figure will exceed 20 per cent before it starts to
fall. The worst hit sectors have been construction, manufacturing and
retail.
Falling tax revenues and high unemployment pay-outs have sent debt soaring.
Foreign debt will rise to FM250bn (Dollars 42bn) this year, while net
interest payments on it will reach FM27bn.
For 1993 alone the state's net borrowing requirement is estimated at almost
FM80bn, pushing up state debt at the year end to nearly 50 per cent of GNP
compared to just 16.5 per cent at the end of 1991.
The fear of further aggravating the debt burden means the centre-right
coalition government has so far ruled out any package to stimulate the
economy. 'There is nothing to hand out, just sacrifices,' said Mr Iiro
Viinanen, the finance minister.
Confirming this, the government this week announced a new FM9.3bn savings
package for 1994 to ensure state spending does not exceed target.
The government is pinning all its hopes on export-led recovery, and on that
score at least, there is cause for optimism. The 30 per cent drop in the
value of the markka that has resulted from two devaluations over the last 16
months has led to a dramatic improvement in the competitiveness of Finnish
industry.
Last year exports grew by 9 per cent, and this year they are predicted to
rise by 11 per cent.
But even here, there is reason for caution, with demand weakened in the
country's main export markets, such as Germany, Sweden and the UK.
The government, led by prime minister Mr Esko Aho, appears to be under no
immediate threat, partly because there is no concensus about alternative
courses of action. Nevertheless, business leaders have recently become
uncharacteristically outspoken in their criticisms.
Mr Pertti Voutilainen, the head of Kansallis-Osake-Pankki implied a lack of
decisive political leadership when he said recently that he did not know the
prime minister's opinions on the European Community, nuclear power policy,
or the country's banking difficulties. The government was able to get FM20bn
in additional support for the banking sector several weeks ago but not
before parliament rejected a broader package which would have done more to
instill confidence in the country's financial system.
The turnround in the Finnish economy should finally become apparent next
year, when 2-3 per cent growth is predicted. Apart from the stimulus of
higher exports, the country is now in a lower interest rate phase which is
expected to lead to higher investment.
One surprising thing is that the pain has been endured with little outcry.
Some put that down to the national temperament. 'Everybody is slightly
ashamed,' says Mr Olli Kivinen, political columnist on Helsingin Sanomat,
the leading Finnish newspaper, 'They took part in the casino economy of the
1980s and now they are willing to suffer for it.'

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell probe set for delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMMONS committee is today expected to announce that it is postponing part
of its inquiry into the theft of funds from Maxwell company pension schemes
after a clash with the Serious Fraud Office.
At a private meeting last night the cross-party committee decided that the
SFO's fears about possible prejudicing of criminal trials and the Commons'
sub judice rules meant that they should not proceed with taking evidence
from witnesses who may be called in trials.
Their report will raise questions over the right of the Commons' select
committees, set up in 1979, to conduct inquiries independently of the
judiciary. The MPs are expected to call for a wider debate into the issue.
The committee could still call for written evidence from witnesses, however,
possibly in the form of answers to questions posed by the committee members.
The replies could then be kept securely to prevent leaks. The MPs decided
against taking oral evidence in private.
Members of the committee are anxious to put pressure on the Serious Fraud
Office to make sure it carries out its investigation speedily and
efficiently - and that the committee's inquiries should not be delayed more
than 18 months.
Meanwhile, the committee is to continue with its inquiries into other
matters arising from the Maxwell affair, including the immediate needs of
pensioner victims and the regulatory framework in which pension funds
operate.
Trustees of pension funds and insolvency practitioners may be among those
called to give evidence.
The committee, chaired by Mr Frank Field, Labour MP for Birkenhead, has had
considerable success in persuading the government to consider pension
reforms, and the companies and financial institutions involved into helping
the Maxwell pensioners.

FT  26 FEB 93 / Parliament and Politics: Pro-EC Tories turn on rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS, ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT received a fillip last night when Euro-sceptic Tory MPs who
have tried to wreck the Maastricht legislation came under attack from more
pro-European colleagues.
A stormy meeting of backbench Tories heard attacks by loyalists on
Conservative rebels who have voted against the government on procedural
motions designed to prevent filibustering on the bill.
Although encouraged by government business managers, the row reflected
growing disquiet in Tory ranks over the snail-like progress the bill is
making through the Commons - and signs that the unease is spreading among
ministers.
But the rebels said last night that they would continue to oppose the bill.
One said: 'It was a good ambush.'
About a dozen Tory Euro-sceptics joined with Labour and Ulster Unionist MPs
later in voting against the government. With the aid of the Liberal
Democrats the government secured a majority of 26 on a motion enabling the
debate to continue after 10 o'clock last night.
So far 13 days have been spent in the Commons on the bill's committee stage.
Britain has come under attack from European Community partners for its slow
ratification.
Government loyalists are annoyed that debate on Maastricht is squeezing out
other government business - such as legislation to crack down on juvenile
offenders or reform Sunday trading laws.
The loyalists complained that defying the government on matters of principle
was understandable, but that attempts to deliberately delay and extend
debates were unacceptable and unprecedented.
The row erupted at a meeting of the backbench 1922 committee, which includes
all Conservative MPs who are not in the government. There were calls for the
resignation of members of the 1922 executive who have voted against the
government.
An all-party campaign for a British referendum on Maastricht was launched
yesterday by the Maastricht Referendum Campaign which has Baroness Thatcher
as a patron.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (27): A capital idea if the cover
looks right - Zero-coupon shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INVESTMENT which pays no income sounds like one for savers to avoid. But
the peculiarities of the British tax system have made zero-coupon preference
shares a much sought-after commodity in recent years. All the return from a
zero comes in the form of capital growth; the share is issued at one price,
and should be repaid at a much greater price in a few years' time.
This profit counts, for tax purposes, as capital gain (unlike the position
on zero coupon bonds, where profits are taxed as income). Since few
investors use up their annual capital gains tax allowance (Pounds 5,800 in
1992-93), the profits are likely to be tax-free.
How do zeros work? They are one class of share within a split-capital
investment trust. A split trust invests in shares in the same way as other
investment trusts, and so repayment of the zero ultimately depends on the
health of the stock market.
However, zeros have first claim on the assets of a trust and are thus
relatively 'safe', although they are still significantly more risky than a
gilt.
The key statistic for judging safety is 'cover'. This measures whether the
current assets of the trust are sufficient to repay the final value of the
zeros. If cover is over 100 per cent, then the trust's assets will need to
fall before there will be any risk to full zero repayment.
You can only really find out the cover level from a stockbroker, which
illustrates how good advice is vital in this area.
Greater risk demands greater reward. So, normally speaking, the 'safer' a
zero, the lower the rate of return. SG Warburg's Private Investor Guide
shows, for example, that at the end of November, the gross redemption yield
on River Plate's zeros (cover 215 per cent) was 7.09 per cent, while the
yield on M&amp;G Recovery zeros (cover 58 per cent) was 11.4 per cent. So when
choosing a zero, the investor has to make a choice between safety and
return.
A second point to consider is the maturity date. You may have some financial
commitment (school fees or a child's wedding) to meet. Zeros can be used as
part of a 'back-to-back' plan with an income-producing security such as a
temporary annuity. The annuity generates a high income; meanwhile, the zero
grows steadily to repay the annuity capital. Taken together, the two
instruments are more tax-efficient than a conventional building society
account would be.
Because of the expansion of the split-capital trust sector in the late
1980s, there is a wealth of maturities on offer. Some will not be paid until
the next millennium; others will mature in 1995.
A third point to remember is that short-term risks are involved. Although
there is an element of certainty about the final redemption value, there are
no guarantees about the day-to-day trading price of a zero.
Zeros behave rather like bonds; their prices rise and fall in inverse
correlation to interest rates. So if interest rates rise, the price of a
zero will normally fall in the short term, as investors sell the zero to buy
better-yielding assets elsewhere.
A sharp fall in the stock market might also cause the price of a zero to
fall, if it raised doubts about the probability that the share would be
repaid in full. Investors should thus regard zeros, like other forms of
shares, as a long-term investment.
One further caveat is needed. There are some split-capital trusts which have
issued zero-coupon debentures; these do not have the same tax advantages as
zero-coupon shares.
For those who find the above factors too complicated, there is a unit trust
which invests specifically in zeros. Exeter's Zero Preference Trust has a
minimum holding of Pounds 750, an initial charge of 5 per cent and an annual
charge of 0.8 per cent.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (26): Leave it late then beware of
salesmen - Year-end tax planning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE world of personal finance, the year ends on April 5, not December 31.
The end of the tax year is a focal point for financial planning, and can
also provide the financial services industry with an opportunity to
celebrate as wildly as the rest of the population does on New Year's Eve.
When time is running out, the opportunities for high-pressure sales
increase, and most salesmen find this the most profitable time of year.
Many personal tax allowances expire at the end of a tax year, and it is
sensible to leave tax-motivated decisions until late in the year, so that
you have a good idea of how much tax you will be asked to pay. Just make
sure that salesmen do not use tax as an excuse to sell investments which
cannot otherwise be justified.
The main planning opportunities are as follows:
Capital Gains Tax: You are allowed to realise gains of up to Pounds 5,800 in
this tax year, before paying any capital gains tax. This allowance is after
indexation - if your investment does no more than keep track with the retail
prices index, then it will not be deemed to have made any gain for CGT
purposes. Details of the indexation allowance are given each month in the
Weekend FT.
This means that normally only the very wealthy need to pay CGT, and even
they can avoid paying much. The classic method of doing this is 'bed and
breakfasting', the stock exchange nickname for selling shares one afternoon
and buying them back the following morning. This is most sensibly done when
you have already made gains above the Pounds 5,800 post-indexation allowance
in the rest of your portfolio. By establishing a loss elsewhere in the
portfolio, you may still not need to pay CGT for the year.
More speculatively, you can establish a capital gain for the year which is
inside the CGT allowance, while establishing a higher base on which gains
will have to be made for tax to be payable in future. Brokers' fees can eat
into tax savings.
Personal Equity Plans: Pep allowances expire at the end of each tax year.
You are allowed to put up to Pounds 6,000 per year into a general Pep (which
can hold a range of shares, investment or unit trusts investing in UK and
other EC equities), and, more speculatively, another Pounds 3,000 into a
single-company Pep. These investments will then be free of capital gains and
income tax, but you invest out of income which has already been taxed. The
concession is most useful for those who already have a large equity
portfolio, while charges make the benefits more marginal for those who do
not.
Business Expansion Schemes: Like Peps, BES allowances expire at the end of
each tax year (although there are also provisions to carry a limited amount
back if you invest in the following year). BES investments are entitled to
full income tax relief at your top marginal rate, so a 40 per cent taxpayer
investing Pounds 1,000 will receive a rebate of Pounds 400, leaving an
effective post-tax investment of Pounds 600. The maximum annual investment
is Pounds 40,000, so the scheme allows Pounds 16,000 in tax to be reclaimed
each year.
With some exceptions, where banks offer 'non-recourse loans' with only BES
shares as security, these investments must be maintained for five years to
qualify for tax relief.
Pensions and AVCs: These are, again, highly tax-efficient as premiums paid
in to a pension fund are 'grossed up'. But you have to be prepared to wait
until retirement before unlocking your money. Those in personal pension
plans should decide how much money they are prepared to contribute for this
year (the precise funding limits vary with age). Extra contributions can be
made most cost-effectively using single-premium pension contracts.
If you are in a company scheme, you can add to your contributions by putting
money into an additional voluntary contribution (AVC). Total contributions
into the company scheme and the AVC combined must not exceed 15 per cent of
your salary.
Inheritance Tax: Several allowances for IHT are sensitive to the end of the
tax year (see E for Estate planning).
Enterprise Zones: Investment in commercial property on enterprise zones
carries the same incentives as the BES, without any upper limit on annual
investment. But commercial property investment in the current environment is
difficult and speculative. Early this year, there were few opportunities for
EZ investment, although there may be more in future. Wealthy investors
should not ignore this route.
Charities: Top-rate taxpayers with a generous bent might use the Gift Aid
scheme as a way of reclaiming tax. Donations of Pounds 400 or more qualify
for Gift Aid relief. If you give Pounds 400, then it will be treated as net
of basic-rate tax, so the charity can claim tax relief at 25 per cent (an
extra Pounds 133.33). Top-rate payers can then reclaim the 15 per cent
difference between the top and basic rates (Pounds 79.99), meaning that the
charity would have been given Pounds 533.33 for a net outlay of Pounds
320.01.
Much of this is complex, and it is easy to make mistakes. If tax-planning
seems to make sense for you, then it is worth paying for the services of a
good accountant.

the net - Expatriates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NO ONE knows quite how many voluntary British exiles there are, but the best
guess seems to be something in the order of two millions.
Under Britain's tax code, the closer their connection with the UK, the
greater their exposure to the major direct taxes - income Tax (IT), capital
gains tax (CGT) and inheritance tax (IHT). In determining how close that
connection should be taken to be, three principal statuses need to be
considered: residence, ordinary residence and domicile.
None has a comprehensive statutory definition. Of the three, residence can
most readily be changed; ordinary residence rather less so; while domicile,
which may be defined briefly if not precisely as your natural homeland, is
the most adhesive.
If you were born in the UK of British domiciled parents and have lived
substantially all of your life there, you will be resident, ordinarily
resident and domiciled within the UK and, as such, liable to IT, CGT and IHT
respectively on worldwide income, gains and assets.
Should you spend a complete tax year abroad (ie, April 6 to April 5) without
emigrating or taking up employment, you will become non-resident for the
year but will remain ordinarily resident and domiciled within the UK. As a
result, your overseas income will escape IT for that year, but in all other
respects your worldwide liability will continue.
By contrast, short-term employment overseas which lasts for more than a
year, although without encompassing a complete tax year, will not change any
of the three statuses. Consequently, your UK tax liability will continue
undiminished except, perhaps, in relation to salary itself. For, if you
spend neither 62 consecutive days, nor more in total than one-sixth of the
days in the period in Britain, it will be exempted.
However, if your job overseas does encompass a full tax year, then -
provided it is full-time employment, all the duties of which are performed
outside the UK (incidental duties in the UK can be ignored for this purpose)
and your home visits exceed neither six months in a tax year nor more than
three months on average - you will be treated as not resident and not
ordinarily resident from the day following your departure.
You will then cease to be liable for tax on all income arising outside the
UK and on all capital gains, wherever arising - with the sole exception of
gains from UK business assets. While your liability to IT would continue in
the case of most UK sources - for example, pensions, letting profits and
dividends - there are some exceptions, including income from certain
holdings of British government securities. By contrast, your liability to
IHT would be totally undiminished.
Bear in mind, though, that if your spouse does not also obtain full-time
employment overseas, then if accommodation is retained in the UK for your
joint use, he/she will be UK resident in any year in which a home visit
takes place, thus reintroducing worldwide liability to CGT and, potentially,
IT too.
What then of those who emigrate? They too will, in most cases, be regarded
as not resident and not ordinarily resident from the day after departure,
provided their absence exceeds a complete tax year and UK visits do not
contravene the six-months or three-months average rules. But there are two
important differences. First, if the emigrant is not working then, as for
non-working spouses, residence status in the UK will follow for any year in
which a UK visit takes place, if accommodation available for occupation is
maintained there.
But, most important, emigrants also cease to be domiciled in the countries
that make up the UK. In consequence, their liability to IHT is downgraded to
tax on UK assets only - but not until three years have elapsed from the
change of status.
Thus the UK's domestic law. But in all of these cases, it must be borne in
mind that the rules can be overridden by the provisions of Britain's many
double taxation treaties. They can affect the determination of residence
status and (in the case of the UK/US agreement) domicile, too. The type of
income which can be taxed and the rate applicable may also be varied.
Apart from this, for expatriates to escape totally from the UK's tax net is
not easy. To do so, they must emigrate, have no income arising in the UK,
remove their assets overseas - and then stay alive for three years]
Furthermore, if after your sojourn overseas you return to your homeland, do
not expect any special treatment. Resumption of permanent residence in the
UK brings with it once again taxation on a worldwide basis. For example, the
fact that your assets have been accumulated wholly during your period
overseas will not prevent the Inland Revenue from claiming up to 40 per cent
of them in IHT when you die.
Is this fair? Or has our national familiarity with expatriates bred, if not
contempt, then perhaps a failure to consider the benefits they bring to the
nation?

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (24): Only worth it if you go the
distance - With-profits policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOBODY WITH a blank sheet of paper would invent the UK's 'with-profits'
system as an ideal way to look after investors' money.
But having evolved into its present convoluted shape as the gift of history,
the with-profits system has proved to have its uses. This year, though,
belief has mounted that the system now carries the seeds of its own
destruction.
In essence, with-profits policies offer exactly the deal which product
providers have fallen over each other in the last year to offer - a
guaranteed return plus a share of any strong market performance if there is
any (see G for Guarantees). But the system started as a form of straight
life assurance in the 19th century, and has only recently evolved into an
investment vehicle.
With-profits is most often sold in the form of an endowment life policy.
This is a variant of life assurance where a sum is guaranteed either when
you die, or, even if you survive, at the end of a fixed period.
Life companies soon realised that it made sense to invest the premiums they
took in to safeguard the payments to policyholders. Then they made profits
above the level of the sum guaranteed. And then they started making pay-outs
to policyholders with the profits of the investments. Hence the term.
The profits are added in the form of bonuses. These come in two forms -
reversionary, or annual, bonuses, which are added on to the value of the sum
assured each year and then cannot be taken away; and terminal bonuses, which
are only added once the policy has matured.
The former normally need to be supported by gilts or other fixed-interest
securities, so the use of terminal bonuses allows life offices more freedom
to invest widely and search for the best profits. However, the terminal
bonus, unlike the reversionary bonus, is not guaranteed from one year to the
next. If an office paid out a hefty terminal bonus one year, there is
nothing to stop it cutting this the following year.
Some companies have multi-tiered bonus systems, where bonuses are announced
each year both as a proportion of the sum assured and of the reversionary
bonuses which have already accrued.
The final pay-out at the end of the endowment's term will consist of the sum
assured plus all bonuses. In theory, the build-up of reversionary bonuses
makes this a stable investment, smoothing out the peaks and troughs of the
market which might afflict investors in unit-linked products.
Investment performance by the with-profits fund is the prime factor in
determining bonuses. Typically, funds are mostly invested in equities,
topped up with holdings in bonds and property, providing a balanced
portfolio. With-profits funds can also benefit from money made out of
'non-profit' business, which does not pay out if the policyholder is still
alive at the end of the term.
But beware the big difference with unit-linked contracts. These investments
have a direct mathematical link to the value of the underlying fund, which
the company must pay out. Bonuses and pay-outs for with-profits funds are
decided entirely at actuarial discretion.
If actuaries get it wrong one year, they must correct it the next. This can
lead to perverse results. In 1990, when the market fell, life insurers
decided that the fall was only a temporary blip, and maintained bonuses.
This was a mistake, which ate into their reserves. It meant that this year,
although the market has risen, bonuses and pay-outs have had to be cut
throughout the industry. These bonuses also reflect lower expectations for
future returns.
Non-investment factors also come into play. If a company's reserves have
fallen, it may be necessary to cut bonuses just to ease the pressure.
Actuaries must also look at the amount of business which is about to mature.
If they only have a few maturities in the coming year, it will not cost them
much to make apparently generous pay-outs. These in turn make it easier to
'window-dress' and sell new policies. Companies faced with a large bubble of
maturing business, however, have a nasty habit of paring pay-outs to the
bone.
So with-profits is not as intrinsically stable an investment as it seems.
Values can wobble on the basis of minor human errors unconnected with
investment conditions.
The other pitfall of the with-profits system is that all of this assumes
that you hold on to the investment to maturity. None of the terminal bonuses
apply if you surrender the policy early, because you will have breached the
contract with the life company.
Early surrender values are calculated on a completely different basis, and
they normally offer far inferior yields to those on offer to those who hold
on to policies to their maturity. A Money Marketing survey found last year
that three offices paid out less than half as much for a 24-year surrender
than they did for a 25-year maturity.
Commissions (see F for Fees and Commissions) and other expenses are
front-loaded, so if you give up a 25-year policy within the first two years
 -and, according to the Securities and Investments Board, this was the fate
of 23 per cent of with-profits policies in 1990 - you will barely have paid
for the costs of selling and setting up the policy, and so will receive a
negligible amount.
With-profits policies can only offer good value for money if you hold on for
the long term, and by signing up for one you are signing away the
flexibility which unit-linked products can offer.

FT  26 FEB 93 / A-Z of Personal Finance (22): Freedom to switch is the big
advantage - Unit-linked bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INSURANCE industry has an answer to unit trusts. It is the unitised
single-premium investment bond.
As with a unit trust (see C for Collective investments), your money is
invested in units of a managed fund, whose value will fluctuate in line with
the value of the fund. When you want to take the profits, you surrender the
policy, and receive the full value of the units you have bought.
Another similarity with unit trusts is that you can buy bonds which invest
in specialist geographical areas, fixed interest securities, money market
instruments, or property.
But the bond is still a life assurance policy. This adds extra
complications, expenses, and tax-planning opportunities.
Disadvantages, compared with unit trusts, include the charges, with
generally higher commissions to intermediaries (see F for Fees versus
commissions), and the fact that you must buy life assurance. The bid-offer
spread, as with unit trusts, is normally around 5 per cent.
If you die, your dependant will receive the value of the bond as life
assurance. This can affect returns, although there is no case for taking out
a unit-linked bond as life assurance in its own right. This can be done much
more cheaply.
What of the difference in returns? According to Finstat, the average UK
equity insurance fund rose by 45.1 per cent in the five years to the
beginning of 1993. Over 10 years, they rose by 265.6 per cent on average.
These figures assume that income is reinvested, but do not include the
bid-offer spread.
Unit trusts in the UK general sector, for which comparative statistics
include the bid-offer spread, did better. Over five years, average growth
with income reinvested was 53.6 per cent, according to Finstat, and over 10
years average growth was 333.7 per cent.
This gap makes bonds hard to justify on investment grounds. But their
'switching' facility could be an advantage. One bond can be used as the
shell for any number of funds. Switching between them can usually be done
for a very low charge, and in some cases for free.
Those prepared to try active management of their portfolio might therefore
prefer insurance bonds to unit trusts where, even if you are switching
between trusts run by the same management company, you will usually have to
pay the full initial fee when you switch.
Then comes the tax argument. No capital gains tax is payable on gains - but
this is not much of an incentive for the vast majority of British savers,
who pay no CGT in any case. Basic-rate tax is paid by the funds at source.
Top-rate payers can then be charged the 15 per cent difference between the
basic and top bands when the bond is surrendered. But tax-planners can use
the reliefs available to avoid this.
Up to 5 per cent of the original value of the bond can be withdrawn each
year, free of income tax. This can therefore be carried on for 20 years.
Top-rate tax will still be payable when the bond is finally encashed, but
the painful sounding 'top-slicing relief' will apply.
Any profit made over the lifetime of the bond is averaged out over the
number of years for which it was in place. The result is added to the
investor's income to arrive at the tax due for that year.
However, tax management must be done very carefully - a withdrawal of more
than 5 per cent in one year can trigger a liability to the extra 15 per cent
tax.
In the last two years, the life industry's most successful product has been
a new kind of bond which is sold to people who often do not need the tax
advantages - the with-profits bond.
These bonds are a hybrid of the unit-linked and the with-profits approaches.
Your investment buys units in the main life fund of the company concerned
(see W for With-profits policies), so it will include holdings in property,
equities and gilts.
Each year, when bonuses are announced, they are added to the value of each
unit. So, in theory, as soon as you want to surrender your bond, you will
receive your units, plus the value of all accrued bonuses.
During 1991, double-figure annual, or reversionary, bonus rates were quoted,
which many found tempting. However, less publicity was given to the fact
that most life companies maintained the right to make a 'market value
adjustment' (MVA). If a big reversionary bonus was followed by a fall in the
market, the company could use the MVA to pay out less than the level of the
total bonuses.
Many investors who had not realised the investments were meant for the long
term surrendered the bonds early, only to find that the MVA had bitten. In
many cases, they were left with less money than they had originally
invested.
The MVA is a fatal flaw in a with-profits bonds, which destroys its
advantages over unit-linked bond. It is best to look for one which makes
guarantees about the MVA - for example, some promise not to apply it on
certain anniversaries, or on death, or on regular income.
