FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Benetton beats trend with 12.1%
advance

BENETTON, Italy's best-known maker of casual clothes, raised net profits by
12.1 per cent to L184.7bn (Dollars 116.8m) last year in spite of the general
slowdown in worldwide consumer spending.
The company, which saw group sales climb by 9.1 per cent to L2,512bn,
indicated its confidence in the future with a L50-a-share dividend increase
to L350. Operating earnings jumped by 14.4 per cent to L356.6bn.
Mr Luciano Benetton, managing director, has admitted that 1993 could be a
more difficult year in view of recession in many markets. But he has
expressed confidence that sales should continue to rise strongly, with
exports likely to be boosted by the steep fall in the value of the lira.
Among the few jarring points in the results was a L154bn surge in group net
debts to L325bn. Benetton said the increase stemmed from the purchase last
year of four local apparel-makers with which it worked closely and whose
borrowings had now been consolidated. Adjusted for the acquisitions, group
net debt would have remained unchanged, it said.
In spite of the recession, Benetton managed to find particular pockets of
growth in individual areas. For the third year running, the Sisley brand
grew strongly, with a 24 per cent leap in sales, while SAB, Benetton's socks
and accessories subsidiary, virtually doubled sales to L96.3bn from L51.8bn
in 1991.
Among other areas now being exploited are shoes and shirts. In recent
months, Benetton has started to create a new chain of stores, named 'and',
specialising in shirts. The goods sold are produced by Azimut, a
newly-formed manufacturer created from the merger of two private companies
in which Benetton has a 50 per cent stake. The 'and' chain now has about 50
shops in Italy and abroad.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Banks look for warmer climes -
Deutsche Bank's latest foray into Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Deutsche Bank paid Pta42bn (Dollars 359.9m) to acquire a Spanish bank
unit earlier this month, eyebrows were raised in the boardrooms of at least
four of the German bank's European rivals.
France's Credit Lyonnais, previously the biggest foreign retail bank in
Spain, saw itself overtaken, Barclays and NatWest of the UK found their
growth strategy in Spain challenged, and Banque Nationale de Paris (BNP) was
left at the starting post.
Deutsche is no newcomer to Spain, for it enjoyed a long relationship with
Banco Comercial Transatlantico (Bancotrans), a Barcelona-based bank which it
bought in 1989.
Following its purchase of Banco de Madrid from Banesto, the big Spanish
retail bank, it has added 300 branches to the existing 100 Bancotrans
offices.
Analysts have praised the pricing - Banesto reportedly wanted Pta60bn for
the unit - and the complementary nature of the two acquisitions. Deutsche
was already strong in the north-east thanks to Bancotrans. Deutsche has now
secured its presence in Madrid and in central Spain with the second
purchase.
The German bank has followed the path into Spain initiated by Credit
Lyonnais when it bought a Madrid network and then a Barcelona network from
Banco de Santander in 1990 and in 1991.
Deutsche, like the French bank, has essentially bought a market quota, but
there the similarities between the strategies end.
A key difference is the timing. By spacing its acquisitions out over four
years, Deutsche has given itself time to develop a complex information
system and specialist products such as mortgages and car loans that were
novel to Spain. Analysts said Credit Lyonnais's rapid acquisition policy had
still to deliver a distinctive profile for the bank in Spain.
The cost of entering Spain provides a more measurable difference. Deutsche
paid 2.1 times book value to acquire Bancotrans and 2.3 times to buy Banco
de Madrid. Credit Lyonnais paid Santander 3.1 times book value for Banco
Comercial in 1990 and 3.3 times a year later for Banca Jover. 'The French
paid demanding multiples,' said Mr Joaquin Tamames, a partner of Axel Group,
the Madrid-based analysts.
The main irony is that Deutsche has ended up with 100 branches more than
Credit Lyonnais. With the 400 offices in Spain, the German bank has a
sufficient spread to promote its products.
In contrast, NatWest entered Spain at the begining of the 1980s by building
up a business base through a joint venture with Spain's March group, while
Barclays bought a small, and bankrupt, domestic bank which it then expanded.
Like Deutsche, NatWest, which subsequently severed its March partnership,
wants to introduce products.
NatWest, with just over 200 branches has profitable peseta assets. 'But the
question is where do we go from here,' said Mr Peter Duffy, managing
director.
NatWest will probably focus on financial instruments such as syndicated
loans. While unlikely to follow the acquisition strategy of Deutsche and
Credit Lyonnais, it may still purchase individual offices. 'What is critical
is not how many branches you have but where they are,' said Mr Duffy.
Barclays, which has 228 outlets, has relentlessly pursued the step-by-step
strategy. But it has proved an expensive route. Spain is an over-banked
country with more bank branches per head of population than anywhere else in
Europe outside Luxembourg.
Nevertheless, Barclays has earned itself the compensation of choosing its
locations and of selecting and training its staff. Its products, notably the
introduction of high-interest bearing current accounts, have been the most
innovative in the domestic banking sector.
Deutsche will require up to eight years to mould its newly-acquired staff
into Deutsche's specific corporate culture and to have its employees extract
optimum benefits from its in-house technology.
BNP, which also bought a small unit in Spain in the 1980s, has meanwhile
shrunk back from an opportunity to establish a Spanish presence similar to
Credit Lyonnais. Earlier this month, it pulled out of lengthy negotiations
to acquire the 165-branch network of Banco de Fomento, a nationwide
subsidiary of Banco Central Hispano (BCH).
The reasons for BNP's withdrawal were never explained, but it is understood
the state-owned bank was unwilling to commit itself to such a large
investment in advance of the legislative elections in France.
Banco de Fomento thus remains on the market for those to follow in
Deutsche's slip stream. The problem is whether there is much margin left for
large banking forays into Spain.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Codan pays DKr1.27bn for Hafnia
insurance unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES

<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CODAN, the Danish insurer controlled by the UK's Sun Alliance, yesterday
acquired the insurance and financial service operation of Hafnia, whose
parent company went into receivership in August.
Codan, with premium income of about DKr2bn (Dollars 317.5m) in 1992, paid
DKr1.27bn cash for Hafnia, with premium income about DKr7bn. The new group
will have a market share in Denmark of 18 per cent in accident business and
12 per cent in life business, said Mr Peter Zobel, chief executive in Codan.
The sale, which followed the failure the find a buyer through a tender
process, became a matter of urgency last week. The group's capital adequacy
ratio fell below the legal minimum when the price of shares in the other
large Danish insurer, Baltica Holding, fell sharply. Hafnia owns just over
33 per cent of Baltica Holding's shares.
On March 15, Baltica Insurance offered to buy Hafnia's insurance business if
no other buyer could be found, and it looked at the time as though an
all-Danish solution had been found to the chaos created by the collapse of
Hafnia Holding and Baltica Holding.
Codan does not need credit arrangements to finance the deal, said Mr Zobel.
The Codan insurance company was founded by the Zobel family. Mr Peter Zobel,
is the fourth generation of the family to run the business, although Sun
Alliance, with 70 per cent of the shares, has been in control for over 20
years.
Codan has concentrated on core insurance business and avoided the kind of
ventures into banking and other financial service and investment activities
which brought Hafnia Holding and Baltica Holding to their knees.
It has consistently been the most profitable of the larger Danish insurers,
although losses on its securities portfolio caused a net loss of DKr74m in
1992, compared with a profit of DKr275m in 1991.

FT  30 MAR 93 / International Company News: Former OCP chief may appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jean-Pierre Duche, the former president of Office Commercial
Pharmaceutique, France's largest medicines wholesaler, is considering
appealing against the conduct of the annual meeting last Friday when he was
ousted from office.
Mr Duche, who was voted out of office during a six-hour meeting, had
supported a FFr2.12bn (Dollars 378.6m) friendly takeover by Gehe, Germany's
largest wholesaler. Mr Duche has been replaced by Mr Pierre Bourely.
Mr Bourely, whose family owns 15 per cent of the OCP, has opposed the Gehe
offer and is attempting to put together a French counter-bid. The departure
of Mr Duche will allow Mr Bourely to declare the German bid hostile. He
claims the FFr800 a share offer is too low.
During Friday's turbulent meeting, a number of shareholders were
disqualified for not registering their votes in time. In addition, the
Bourely family had undertaken not to present a motion for the removal of Mr
Duche.
Fidelity, the US investment group which owns 9.79 per cent of OCP, decided
not to abstain at the last moment and voted against Mr Duche. In the key
vote, Mr Duche gained 861,000 votes, while there were 1,064,000 against him.
Mr Duche, OCP's president for 15 years, continues to be a member of the
boards of two holding companies, SGP and Eurosante.
These control OCP France Repartition and OCP Europe, two OCP subsidiaries
responsible for 90 per cent of its FFr33bn turnover.
Meanwhile, Mr Bourely, together with Paribas, the Paris-based merchant bank,
has until the middle of April to put together a counter-bid for OCP. The
consortium is attempting to raise between FFr1.5bn and FFr2.5bn.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Pearson beats forecasts with Pounds 151m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the publishing, banking and industrial group which owns the
Financial Times, announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 150.8m for 1992, a fall
of 16 per cent, but significantly better than forecasts which ranged as low
as Pounds 134m.
The result, coupled with a proposed increase in the final dividend to 6.625p
(6.25p) for a total of 12p (11.625p), boosted the Pearson share price which
closed up 27p at 404p. Earnings per share were 19.3p (24.7p).
Lord Blakenham, chairman and chief executive, said that despite lower
profits the company was starting to see benefits from a cost reduction
programme which had included some 3,000 redundancies in just over two years.
'We generated more cash than ever before, and held or increased our share of
sales in many of our markets,' he said.
Reporting under the new FRS 3 accounting standard, the 1991 pre-tax profit
of Pounds 179.6m was boosted by a Pounds 33.2m gain on the sale of an
associate. Interest payable fell to Pounds 13.6m (Pounds 19.6m).
Operating profit from continuing operations, at Pounds 155.6m, was down 8
per cent. The main reason was the collapse in profits of oil services from
Pounds 34.7m to Pounds 500,000 on turnover down from Pounds 318.7m to Pounds
289.8m.
Mr David Veit, chief executive of the division, blamed a fall in gas prices
and drilling activity. A total of Dollars 20m (Pounds 14m) was spent on
redundancies and closures, and capital expenditure was cut from Dollars 42m
to Dollars 24m. The division has been profitable so far this year.
Books were 'the star performer', with operating profit up 35 per cent to
Pounds 80.4m. Penguin profits doubled to Pounds 26.3m on record sales and
had eight titles in the January best sellers list in the New York Times.
The Financial Times group increased profits by 5 per cent to Pounds 18.5m
including contributions from foreign newspapers such as Les Echos but
excluding associate companies. The newspapers division overall made Pounds
31.1m, a 5 per cent improvement.
Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson's chief operating officer, said that BSkyB was now
making operating profits of more than Pounds 1m a week. The first return in
the form of interest on loan stock was expected this year.
Investment banking showed a 9 per cent fall, with an operating profit of
Pounds 23.7m. Profits from fine china fell by 39 per cent to Pounds 10.7m.
Lord Blakenham said Pearson was now 'potentially very profitable' following
cost-cutting and savings.
Mr Guy Lamming, a James Capel media analyst, yesterday described the results
as 'mixed' with better-than-expected performances from books and banking.
'There is the feeling that they have scraped the bottom and things are
looking up for the company,' he said, increasing his 1993 pre-tax forecast
from Pounds 170m to Pounds 179m.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Forth Ports higher at Pounds 10.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORTH PORTS, the Scottish port operator which was privatised and floated
last year, yesterday announced its first annual results and said trading was
expected to be more difficult this year.
Pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 8.23m to Pounds 10.9m in the year to
December 31. However, most of the rise stemmed from a Pounds 1.23m
exceptional gain through the early repayment of government loans. This had
previously been treated as extraordinary, but has been restated following
the decision to adopt FRS 3.
Turnover was unchanged at Pounds 32.4m. Tonnage from British Pipe Coaters,
one of the company's largest customers, fell by 30 per cent as North Sea
orders for BPC's services declined. However, tonnage from containers and
piped cargoes increased slightly and the company said grain and animal feed
tonnage also increased.
Mr Hugh Thompson, chief executive, said BPC tonnage was likely to fall again
this year, perhaps more sharply. He said Forth had been winning new
business, but profits from new and enlarged contracts would not be reflected
in this year's profits.
Operating profits increased from Pounds 7.5m to Pounds 9.98m. Forth also
reported adjusted figures to exclude the exceptional profit and certain cash
balances which reverted to the government following privatisation. On this
adjusted basis, pre-tax profits increased from Pounds 6.2m to Pounds 8.7m.
Earnings were 23.8p or, on an adjusted basis, 17.5p. The final dividend is
4.25p to make 6.25p.
COMMENT
Forth's share price of 235p has doubled in a year since the 110p flotation.
This stems more from an undervalued offer price than enthusiasm about the
company's trading conditions. Yesterday's results would have been flat
without the accounting changes, and the outlook will remain lacklustre for
at least another 12 months. As well as BPC, Forth reported little upturn in
construction materials throughput, even against a poor 1991, and a Russian
coal contract is likely to fall below forecast. However, the company should
start to benefit from falling overheads - another 47 employees departed last
year - and there could be good news on the Scottish Office property soon.
Forecast profits of Pounds 7.5m put the shares on just under 15 times.
Although Forth is an interesting smaller operator, it looks fully valued
unless economic recovery is quicker than expected or the company pulls off a
tidy acquisition.

<TEXT>
ASPEN Communications yesterday reported a 7.3 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 1.83m for 1992, on turn-over up 8.3 per cent at Pounds
60.3m.
The profit was struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 510,000 (Pounds
440,000) for bad debts and redundancies.
The marketing services division had another difficult year with a severe
downturn in Paris, but added new contracts such as Saab's direct marketing
worldwide.
The group started building higher margins activities, such as direct mail
products and a magazine joint-venture with the Post Office aimed at older
people, said Mr Henry Meakin, chairman. Supplying electronic inflight
entertainment to British Airways is a sizeable development for the future,
he added.
Gearing was down to 29.6 per cent at the year end, against 35.7 per cent in
1991.
The proposed final dividend is up by 32 per cent at 2.9p, for a maintained
total of 4.9p payable from earnings per share of 8.6p (8p).

Sir Patrick Sheehy's pay as chairman of BAT Industries rose from Pounds
638,416 to Pounds 980,679 in 1992, the annual accounts showed.
Of this, Pounds 356,250 was performance-related, against Pounds 57,970 last

Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 900,000) was performance-related.
The group reported a 68 per cent advance in pre-tax profits to Pounds 1.65bn
in 1992. Earnings more than doubled to 58.7p and the dividend was up 11 per
cent at 37.2p.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Scottish Asian assets ahead 28%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH Asian Investment, managed by Murray Johnstone, reported net asset
value per share increased by 28 per cent, from 687p to 882p, in the six
months to January 31, helped by sterling's devaluation.
This, together with a continued narrowing of the discount to net asset value
since the move onshore from Jersey early last year, resulted in the share
price jumping by 41 per cent over the period, from 547p to 773p. The shares
were unchanged yesterday at 895p.
Commenting upon the results directors said the period was notable 'for the
wide divergence of performance in Far East stock markets, most notably those
of Hong Kong, South Korea and Thailand.'
After changing its domicile the trust is now planning a 4-for-1 scrip issue
to improve liquidity. The proposal will be discussed at an extraordinary
meeting on May 4.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Brown &amp; Jackson recovers to Pounds 0.97m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN &amp; JACKSON, the discount retailer which operates the Poundstretcher
stores, yesterday reported continued progress in its three-year recovery
programme.
The group, which has undergone a management shake-up and financial
restructuring in the past year and has reverted to a December year-end,
reported a pre-tax profit of Pounds 967,000 on turnover of Pounds 241.9m in
the 15 months to December 31.
The profit came after a Pounds 981,000 exceptional charge incurred in
connection with the financial reconstruction.
There were losses per share of 0.3p and a token final dividend of 0.1p is
proposed.
To provide a basis for comparison the group, which has also adopted the new
FRS 3 accounting standard, has produced figures for the 12 months to
December 31.
In this period there was a pre-tax loss of Pounds 6.63m (Pounds 18.2m loss
as restated) after net interest payments of Pounds 3.32m (Pounds 4.72m).
Turnover fell to Pounds 167.3m (Pounds 201.9m) with continuing operations
accounting for Pounds 165.6m (Pounds 176.9m).
Commenting on the results Mr Ian Gray, chief executive, said cash
constraints early in the year and the subsequent financial reconstruction
made the year particularly difficult. The goal in 1992, which was achieved,
was to survive and build a foundation for the future.
Sales in the core 230 Poundstretcher stores fell 7 per cent, mainly
reflecting the cash constraints until the Pounds 15.6m proceeds of the share
placing and open offer were received in June. This depressed both sales
volume and gross margins.
In the second half the new management team began to implement a series of
measures to improve profitability including stock reduction, withdrawing
from unprofitable product areas and holding price levels in the 'patchy'
market.
In the Christmas quarter, which traditionally accounts for most of the
profits, sales were 8.3 per cent lower but the gross margin was the same as
the previous year.
After peaking at Pounds 27m in February last year, the group's highly
seasonal borrowings fell to Pounds 3.2m at year-end. Net borrowings of
Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 22.5m) represented gearing of 52 (223) per cent.
Mr Gray and Mr Bob Ellis, finance director, noted that there had been some
limited evidence of economic recovery with Poundstretcher sales running
about 5 1/2 per cent ahead of last year.
COMMENT
After rescuing Brown &amp; Jackson from the brink of receivership the new
management is getting back to retailing basics. Management and merchandising
systems have been introduced at Poundstretcher for the first time in order
to leverage the group's aggregate 1.3m sq ft of retailing space. By the end
of July all the stores will have electronic point of sale systems, stores
are being refurbished and a new trading strategy is already in place. So far
the results are on track and the signs are hopeful, but there is still much
to do. Depending on the economy the group may manage little more than to
break-even this year, but that would be no mean achievement. The stock has
crawled back up to 15 1/2 p from its low of 2 1/2 p at the end of 1991.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hickson back in the black with Pounds 24.3m
 -Fine chemicals business showed strongest advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HICKSON International, the speciality chemicals company, returned to the
black with pre-tax profits of Pounds 24.3m for the year to December 31,
against losses of Pounds 4.5m.
Sir Gordon Jones, chairman, said the company had spent the last year
reorganising its businesses and strengthening management. 'We now know what
we are best at,' he said.
Hickson had become 'financially secure' following the Pounds 70m rights
issue in 1991. Three acquisitions had been made, for a total of Pounds
34.5m, including the Pounds 24m purchase of PharmaChem in Ireland. This had
given Hickson an important entry to the pharmaceuticals market, he said.
Sir Gordon was cautious about the short-term outlook, warning that economic
downturn in Germany would affect profits there, and in the Netherlands and
France. About 25 per cent of profits comes from mainland Europe.
However, the upturn in the US was expected to offset the European decline.
The US and dollar dependent economies are responsible for some 40 per cent
of profits.
The sharp turnround in pre-tax profits reflected the disposal of the floor
coverings business in 1991, which had resulted in a Pounds 19.4m loss that
year, and the absence of a Pounds 6.6m provision for environmental
liabilities and potential litigation. Under the new accounting standards,
these charges must be taken above the line.
Pre-tax profits from con-tinuing operations were ahead 85 per cent at Pounds
29.2m. Sales for the group as a whole fell by 7 per cent to Pounds 342.5m,
although on-going businesses showed an 11 per cent increase to Pounds
328.2m.
The final dividend is maintained at 5.15p, for a total of 8p. Earnings per
share were 10.5p, partly helped by a lower tax charge, against losses of
6.7p. On a continuing operations basis, earnings per share rose from 6.1p to
12.7p.
Within the group's four divisions, fine chemicals showed the strongest
increase with profits ahead 44 per cent to Pounds 15m. PharmaChem
contributed Pounds 2.3m. The protection and coatings operation was hit by a
sharp decline in Italy and fell 4 per cent to Pounds 9.9m. Performance
products fell 12 per cent to Pounds 9m.
COMMENT
The simplest guide to Hickson's performance might be the decision to
maintain the final dividend. The company appears to have suffered a bit in
the second half, particularly in Italy. Sir Gordon indicated yesterday that
Hickson expected 'relative stability and consolidation' in 1993, in spite of
a US recovery. Nevertheless, there might be gains with the three
acquisitions, especially PharmaChem. Forecasts are for an increase in
pre-tax profits of continuing operations from Pounds 29.2m to Pounds 34.5m
this year, after currency gains and organic growth. This leaves the shares
up with the sector's rating of about 15 times. Hickson's attractions might
become greater when economic recovery on both sides of the Atlantic begins
to take shape.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BM's share price continues to slide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of BM Group, the construction equipment group, fell another
5p to 42p yesterday after news emerged of mounting debts and losses.
The group is set to announce a survival plan, involving disposals to cut
debt, alongside its half-year results. Its market value has fallen to about
a tenth of last year's peak of nearly Pounds 460m.
Some editions of Saturday's Financial Times carried details of the group's
worse-than-expected financial state. It is set to breach banking covenants
on interest cover and gearing.
By June 30, net debt is expected to have doubled to more than Pounds 120m,
resulting in gearing of more than 100 per cent.
Part of the equation is the slide in shareholders' funds from Pounds 171m
last June to an estimated Pounds 120m.
This would follow 1992-93 pre-tax losses of about Pounds 30m, compared with
last year's record Pounds 34.6m profit on sales of Pounds 519.5m. The main
component is forecast to be exceptional costs of Pounds 40m to cover such
things as restructuring and the disposal of loss-making businesses.
The balance sheet will also take in a write-down in the value of the pension
fund, which had been subjected to some aggressive accounting.
The survival plan includes slimming down the group to leave turnover at less
than Pounds 400m. Among the planned disposals to reduce debt is a 75 per
cent stake in British Building and Engineering Appliances. The dividend is
certain to be cut.
The share price collapsed last June after the resignation through ill health
of Mr Roger Shute, its founding chairman.
A root-and-branch review of the formerly acquisitive group's operations has
been carried out under Mr Moger Woolley, the new chairman, against the
background of declining sales.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Sales fall sees 3% slip at
Macallan-Glenlivet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MACALLAN-Glenlivet, the Scottish distiller, yesterday announced its first
profits fall in 10 years with a 3 per cent decline at the pre-tax level to
Pounds 7m for the 12 months to December 31. Sales were 4 per cent lower at
Pounds 16.8m.
Mr Brian Cameron, company secretary, said the group had been hit by a
decline in demand from blenders, who were cutting back on stock. Sales of
blend whisky fell by 28 per cent and were expected to fall again in the
current year.
Blenders were extremely cautious at the moment, Mr Cameron said, having
suffered the consequences of a 'whisky lake' in the 1980s. However, they had
indicated that they expected an improvement in 1994. 'We are reasonably
confident it will pick up again,' he said. Even at these depressed levels,
blend sales were higher than the last downturn.
The squeeze in this part of the business was offset by an 11 per cent
increase in volumes of The Macallan, the group's bottled brand.
Italy proved to be the most successful export market, with the US also
showing year on year growth. About 80 per cent of Macallan's production is
exported.
Mr Cameron said the devaluation of sterling might help foreign retailers to
maintain prices, although all of the UK company's exports were paid for in
sterling.
Sales in the UK had been flat.
During the year, Macallan spent Pounds 2.1m to promote The Macallan brand
worldwide and Pounds 2.2m was budgeted for this year.
Sales of bottled whisky were expected to be more difficult in the current
year, although the company intended to maintain production at similar
levels.
The group's confidence of an eventual upturn was reflected in a higher final
dividend of 0.615p, resulting in a 20 per cent increase in the total to
0.915p. Earnings per share were 4.45p (4.87p).

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: SelecTV chief ousted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Buckley has been replaced as chairman of SelecTV, the independent
television production, writes Raymond Snoddy.
The move came after the Sunday Times reported that SelecTV had issued a writ
against Mr Allan McKeown, the managing director who runs the Los Angeles
office.
Mr Peter Laister, a non-executive director who has taken over the chair with
immediate effect, said last night: 'This is a situation in which a writ was
issued without the knowledge of the full board.'
The writ issued in the High Court alleged a breach of fiduciary duty and
using company funds without proper approval.
Mr Laister said it looked as if the issues involved would turn out to be 'as
much administrative and technical problems as anything else.'
However, Richards Butler, the company solicitor, has been asked to carry out
a full review as quickly as possible and report back this week.
'I am determined to get to the bottom of this and clear it up as quickly as
possible and get back to concentrating on programme making. I don't see any
difficulty in doing that,' said Mr Laister.
All the signs are that Mr Buckley was removed from office more because the
affair became public than because of the issuing of the writ.
The writ was never served and Mr Laister said last night it was the board's
intention to have it withdrawn.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Hambro to sell Londonderry Hotel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDONDERRY Hotel, the central London hotel which was being redeveloped
by Brent Walker, the property and leisure group, has been put up for sale by
Hambro Leasing, part of Hambros Bank. A guide price of Pounds 33m has been
set.
Hambro Leasing bought the hotel in November 1989, arranging to lease it to
Brent Walker. That company, which last year completed a financial
restructuring, closed it for refurbishing in April 1991.
However, Brent Walker is understood to have decided that a sale of the hotel
would not cover its leasing commitment and pulled out of the arrangement.
Brent Walker's liability to Hambro Leasing will be added to the group's
general indebtedness. Hambro Leasing is thought to have other security on
the hotel.
The sale of the hotel, situated on Park Lane, is being handled by Weatherall
Green &amp; Smith.
When Brent Walker publishes its accounts, probably in May, they are expected
to show compensation for loss of office totalling some Pounds 1.5m. These
cover a number of departures including Mr Ken Scobie, until January the
group's chief executive, and Mrs Jean Walker, a former executive director of
the group.
Mrs Walker, wife of Mr George Walker, the former chairman and chief
executive, is understood to have received a package, including pension
entitlements, of about Pounds 340,000.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: NatWest Securities changes earnings stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATWEST SECURITIES has announced a change in the way it will be calculating
companies' 'normalised' earnings as a result of the new format introduced by
FRS 3, the new accounting standard on the profit and loss account.
In a circular to clients, it says it has re-cast its previous formula and
will exclude non-trading - or capital - items in its own figure.
The details come as many analysts are pondering how best to interpret FRS 3,
which all but abolishes extraordinary items and changes the structure of
company accounts.
The firm stresses that its forecast normalised earnings will therefore show
the expected operating performance of a company in the light of its
structure during the reporting period.
NatWest's separate calculation for 'maintainable' earnings will include
simply acquisitions, continuing business operations and exceptional
recurring charges from a company's trading results.
It says there will never be agreement on a standardised definition of
earnings while too much is expected from a single figure.
NatWest also says professional investors should welcome FRS 3 as a chance to
re-examine the tools of their trade.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Caverdale loss rises to Pounds 0.95m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Caverdale Group, the motor and engineering trade consumables group, fell
further into the red in 1992 with a pre-tax loss of Pounds 950,000, against
Pounds 244,000.
Mr Arild Nerdrum, chairman, said the results had been affected by charging
Pounds 470,000 in goodwill which had been previously written off against
reserves. Also, the incorporation of Caverdale Motor Holdings and the
acquisition of the loss-making Dunham &amp; Haines showed a combined pre-tax
loss of Pounds 220,000.
Turnover was Pounds 12.9m (Pounds 10.3m) with acquisitions contributing
Pounds 4.36m. Losses per share were 0.94p (1p).

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Linread returns to black with Pounds 1.32m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LINREAD, the Birming-ham-based fasteners and precision components group,
last year consolidated its financial position, with pre-tax profits of
Pounds 1.32m, compared with losses of Pounds 2.2m.
With earnings per share for the 12 months to December 31 of 7.26p,
contrasting with losses of 13.84p, the group is resuming what it called 'a
progressive dividend policy' and lifting its final to 2.25p. This brings the
total for the year to 3.75p, against 3.5p which was paid from reserves.
Selling primarily in the aerospace and automotive markets, the group saw
turnover slip from Pounds 39.7m to Pounds 37.8m. Sales were slightly lower
to aerospace customers, where margins were lower, but higher on the
automotive side, where they showed a small increase.
Under a new management team, Linread has over the last year driven towards
greater productivity; the number of employees has been reduced 9 per cent to
755, but the average level of sales per employee has grown 20 per cent.
Borrowings have been restructured on to a longer term basis and gearing has
been reduced from 59 per cent to 29 per cent.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: DTI gives approval to ITN restructuring
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LAST significant barrier to the restructuring of Independent Television
News was crossed yesterday when the Department of Trade and Industry gave
its approval to the deal.
The seven member consortium which will in future own ITN has also reached
agreement in principle to buy its central London headquarters from Stanhope
Properties in a deal worth Pounds 74m. Losses of Pounds 5m a year on the
lease triggered the restructuring.
The offer for ITN is expected to go unconditional tomorrow. It will mean
that in future there will be seven shareholders instead of 15.
Carlton, Central, London Weekend Television, Granada and Reuters will each
have 18 per cent and Scottish Television and Anglia 5 per cent apiece.
The three outgoing ITV companies, Thames, TVS and Television South West,
were each offered Pounds 14 a share and the continuing ITV companies such as
HTV and Yorkshire will only get par for their Pounds 1 shares.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Reduced interest charge behind 20% rise at
MY
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LOWER interest charge helped MY Holdings, the USM-quoted paper and
packaging company, increase interim profits by 20 per cent.
The rise - from Pounds 758,000 to Pounds 911,000 in the six months to
February 28 - came despite a 3 per cent fall in turnover to Pounds 16.1m.
The company said its cushion packaging division suffered a fall in demand
while margins were pressured by higher material costs and lower selling
prices.
Operating profits fell 7 per cent to Pounds 983,000. Interest costs fell
from Pounds 305,000 to Pounds 72,000 because of lower interest rates and
tight cash control. The company said borrowings had risen since the year end
but gearing remained low at 16 per cent.
Kohler Packaging, the carton manufacturer acquired in February, is expected
to contribute to profits in the second half.
Earnings increased 1.48p (1.47p) per share. The in-terim dividend is
unchanged at 0.25p.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HOLMES Protection, the US security group quoted in the UK, has been forced
to cancel a small share placing after an un-named overseas investor failed
to honour its agreement to pay for 1m shares.
The group, headed by a new management team led by Sir Ian MacGregor,
credited a turnround in its year-end results reported last month to the
successful completion of a three-month debt restructuring programme. The
1.08m share placement was announced at the same time as the year-end
results.
Yesterday the company said sufficient placing commitments had been received,
but that the placing in its present form was being cancelled because of the
problem with the un-named overseas investor.
The group added that it has started legal proceedings against the investor.
The shares were unchanged at 64p yesterday ahead of the announcement.

<TEXT>
EDINBURGH FUND Managers announced a 4.5 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
from Pounds 4.78m to Pounds 5m in the year to January 31.
Funds under management at the group, which is 54 per cent owned by British
Investment Trust, rose from Pounds 1.91bn to Pounds 2.39bn. Part of that
increase was due to rising stock markets; Pounds 254m of net new money was
attracted during the year.
Since the end of January, EFM has acquired Target Trust Managers, with
Pounds 110m under management. Over the weekend, EFM Dragon, an investment
trust managed by the group, announced that its bid for Drayton Asia, a trust
with Pounds 125m of assets, had gone unconditional.
Private Fund Managers, the private client subsidiary, now has Pounds 235m
under management and made its first significant profit contribution.
Operating profit rose to Pounds 3.87m (Pounds 3.21m). Earnings fell to 18.1p
(18.6p). The final dividend is increased to 8.5p, making a total of 13.5p
(13p).

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: BCSR directors frustrate move for
restructuring of board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHAREHOLDER move to restructure the board of Bristol Channel Ship
Repairers has been frustrated by a boardroom coup.
Shareholders attending an extraordinary meeting called at the request of the
company's biggest shareholder, Andreas Ugland, the private Norwegian
shipping group, backed resolutions which would have wrestled boardroom
control away from Mr Christopher Bailey, the current chairman, and three of
his associates.
Ugland built up a 24.19 per cent stake in Bristol Channel through its UK
subsidiary, acquiring the bulk of its stake in July when it bought 18m
shares from CH Bailey, which also operates dry dock facilities in the
Bristol Channel.
This cut Bailey's holding to 8.21 per cent. Three Ugland directors joined
the board but since then the two sides have conducted an increasingly
acrimonious debate over the management, financial performance and prospects
of the company, which owns five docks in South Wales.
This led to the move by Ugland to remove three Bristol Channel directors, Mr
James Garvin, Mr Michael David and Mr Lionel Dotchon, and appoint Viscount
Tenby to a new five member board. These resolutions were passed at the EGM
held on Friday.
However, Mr Bailey convened a directors' meeting the day before the EGM and
24 hours after the closing time for proxies.
At the meeting, attended by the three directors under attack, four
previously undisclosed additional non-executive directors were appointed
together with Viscount Tenby. The four are Sir Robin Maxwell-Hyslop, Mr
Kenneth Griffin, Mr Thomas Bishop and Mr Robert Scammell.
In addition, one of the removed directors, Mr David, was appointed general
manager of the ship repair yard.
In a statement issued after the action Ugland claimed that 'the manner and
circumstances in which the new directors were appointed is wholly
unacceptable.
'The shareholders' intentions and wishes as carried at the EGM have been
frustrated by a clear abuse of Director's fiduciary duties and powers'.
Mr John Love, one of the three Ugland directors on the board, said Ugland
was 'reviewing the situation'.
No-one from CH Bailey was available for comment yesterday. Mr Bailey was
said to be 'out of the country.'
Last month BCSR reported a Pounds 236,261 loss for the 28 weeks to October
9, against a profit of Pounds 74,884. The loss, on turnover of just Pounds
34,192 (Pounds 661,801), included a Pounds 150,000 non-recurring item 'for
cancelling and amending management agreements with CH Bailey'.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Right people, right plan but at the wrong
time - Why Argos closed its furniture arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGOS' recent decision to close its pilot Chesterman furniture was an
unfortunate, if not unexpected, blow for the catalogue retailer, which has
many admirers among the UK's shoppers and in the City of London.
On top of the Pounds 18.9m closure costs and losses last year, which pushed
Argos' pre-tax profit down 15 per cent to Pounds 52.9m, Chesterman's demise
was the more unfortunate because it was the retailer's first diversification
away from catalogue showrooms since its demerger in 1990 from BAT
Industries.
The Chesterman concept seemed very attractive when it was first researched
at the tail end of the consumer spending boom in 1989. It involved
out-of-town superstores of 30,000 to 40,000 sq ft, selling quality furniture
to 'empty nesters', parents aged 35 to 55 whose children were leaving home.
The project was also well-executed. Visitors to the four stores in Mill Hill
in London, Chatham in Kent, Fareham in Hampshire and in Bristol, liked what
they found, according to the company's research.
However, the timing was all wrong. After initial research, the project had
to be put on hold when Sir James Goldsmith's Hoylake consortium made its
Pounds 13.3bn bid for BAT Industries, then Argos's parent company, in 1989.
By the time BAT had demerged Argos as part of its bid defence, and the
company was able to launch Chesterman, the UK retailing climate had
undergone what Mr Mike Smith, Argos' chief executive, called a 'fundamental
sea change'.
'I can't fault the management or staff involved in Chesterman,' said Mr Bob
Stewart, finance director. 'The problems were in building up customer
awareness, and that this area of up-market furniture has been one of the
worst affected in the recession.'
Timing has perhaps not been Argos' strong point. It emerged from what was
the Green Shield trading stamp company in 1973 - just as the oil crisis,
raging inflation and a downturn in consumer spending was making life very
difficult for retailers.
But the instincts of Mr Richard Tompkins, founder of the Green Shield
empire, proved correct. Argos began expanding rapidly from 1975 and by 1979,
when ill health forced Mr Tompkins to sell the chain to BAT for Pounds 35m,
it had 91 showrooms and a turnover of Pounds 113m.
Eleven years later, when Argos regained independence - now with 250
showrooms and Pounds 900m turnover - the UK was once more sliding into
recession. Profits fell from Pounds 75.1m in 1990 to Pounds 62.1m last year.
This week's results, however, give grounds for optimism. Stripping out the
Chesterman costs, pre-tax profits rose to Pounds 71.8m, compared with a
restated Pounds 63.8m last year. Turnover topped Pounds 1bn for the first
time.
It is not widely appreciated that Argos is the UK's leading retailer of
small electrical appliances, as well as sofa beds, telephones and keep fit
equipment. It occupies second place in jewellery and DIY tools.
Retailing analysts view the business as one with considerable underlying
strength - thanks to its success in keeping costs down and introducing new
systems, as well as its pre-eminent position in its market - and feel it is
well-placed to benefit from any upturn in consumer spending.
Moreover, the business is far from mature. At present it has 302 stores, but
has a 'pragmatic' target of more than 500 stores in the UK, having
identified 600 potential sites. At a rate of 20 or 25 new openings a year,
the chain should be expanding well into the next decade.
Mr John Richards, stores analyst at NatWest Securities, believes an annual
growth rate of 12 per cent at operating profits level is possible over the
next five years.
But, however competent Argos is at running, and growing its core business,
sooner or later it will need to diversify.
Mr Smith says important lessons have been learnt from Chesterman - that the
gap between research and launching a new format has to be shortened, project
fundamentals have to be constantly re-examined, and future diversifications
will have to be closer to Argos' core areas of competence and involve lower
overheads.
Continental Europe is unlikely to see Argos catalogue showrooms opening in
the near future, as, says Mr Smith, 'The rules of the game there are
difficult to understand, let alone execute.' He also sees overseas
acquisitions as highly risky, so the UK remains the likely area for
diversification.
After the unhappy experience with Chesterman, however, it may be a year or
two before Argos is prepared to put its head above the parapet again.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: CrestaCare announces changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW INVESTORS and a new chief executive were announced yesterday by
CrestaCare, the nursing home group currently withdrawing from its
problematic property interests.
Mr Andrew Taee has become chief executive, replacing Mr John McAllister who
resigned with immediate effect. Mr Taee arranged the purchase of a 24.04 per
cent stake in the group from Asia Securi-ties International by a range of
institutions and private individuals at a price of 31 1/2 p. CrestaCare's
shares closed yesterday at 35p, up 4p.
The deal was completed on Sunday, after Mr Taee flew to Hong Kong last week
to make Asia Securities an offer for the stake. No broker was involved. Asia
Securities had built the stake over a number of years but following a change
of ownership no longer found it an appropriate investment, Mr Taee said.
He said yesterday that Mr McAllister had done 'an excellent job in cleaning
up the balance sheet and focusing the group on the healthcare sector'. Now,
he said, he would take the group on from there.
Mr Taee is chairman and a principal shareholder in Grosvenor House Group,
which leases three nursing homes to CrestaCare. He also owns Premier
Healthcare (UK), one of the new investors in CrestaCare with a 1.91 per cent
stake.
Four institutions took the bulk of Asia Securities' stake, Schroder
Investment Management, with 9.54 per cent, Gartmore Investment with 5.72 per
cent, Morgan Grenfell Asset Management 3.81 per cent and Mercury Asset
Management 1.91 per cent.

ARNOTTS, the Dublin-based department store company, reported halved pre-tax
profits for the year January 31. High interest rates, the currency crisis

On turnover of IPounds 43.1m (IPounds 44.1m) pre-tax profits fell from
IPounds 4.22m to IPounds 2.24m (Pounds 2.23m). Net interest rose to IPounds
665,000 (IPounds 360,000) reflecting higher interest and borrowings for the

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Lucas' Pounds 5.2m meets promise - Engineer
on track with plans to reduce costs and restore profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUCAS INDUSTRIES, the international engineering group, yesterday delivered
its promise of breaking even in the first half of its 1992-93 year.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 5.2m on turnover of Pounds 1.29bn for the
six months to January 31, against Pounds 200,000, inflated to Pounds 90.2m
from a contribution from the pension fund, on sales of Pounds 1.15bn last
time.
Sir Anthony Gill, chairman, said Lucas was 'on track with its plans to
reduce costs, restore profitability and improve cash generation' and,
therefore, is maintaining the interim dividend at 2.1p.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 0.3p, against 10.3p if the pension
fund contribution is taken into account or losses of 0.6p if it is not.
In a half year when the increase in total sales came largely from favourable
translation of exchange rates, the brightest spot in the trading performance
came from the automotive division: operating profits rose from Pounds 2.7m
to Pounds 13.2m. In aerospace, however, there was a decline from Pounds
10.5m to Pounds 7.2m. Applied technology operating profits were marginally
higher at Pounds 4.5m (Pounds 3.9m).
Margins have been wafer thin: 2.2 per cent in the aerospace division, down
from 3.4 per cent; 1.7 per cent in the automotive division, up from 0.4 per
cent; and 2.6 per cent in applied technology, up from 2.5 per cent.
Immediate market prospects are encouraging only in isolated parts of the
business, like diesel engine injection systems.
'Delayed world economic recovery must inevitably dampen sales prospects for
this year,' said Sir Anthony.
This suggested that Lucas's aim of earning enough to pay covered dividends
for this financial year - indicating annual pre-tax profits of some Pounds
75m - is dependent on the internal changes of its restructuring programme.
By the year end Lucas will have spent Pounds 52m of last year's Pounds 88.4m
provision for restructuring. Annual costs of Pounds 85m have been taken out
of the business.
The workforce will have been reduced to about 50,250 by 2,800 redundancies
and the loss of a further 2,500 through divestments.
A new management structure is already in place, although the appointment of
a new chief executive is still awaited.
Lucas also announced that it had signed a contract with BMR Rolls-Royce to
supply engine mounted accessory gear boxes for the BR700 series. The
contract is worth about Dollars 100m (Pounds 70.4m). The group plans to
dispose of two aerospace businesses in the UK - a switchgear and ignition
plant in Coventry and a wiring systems plant in Newcastle-under-Lyme.

FT  30 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Computer People drops to Pounds 145,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPUTER People, the London-based information technology consultancy, saw
pre-tax profit plunge from Pounds 1m to Pounds 145,000 in 1992.
After a tax charge of Pounds 280,000 the group was forced into a loss of
Pounds 135,000 (profit Pounds 758,000), or 0.97p per share (earnings 5.48p).
The final dividend is omitted, leaving the year's payment at 0.65p (5.4p).
Mr Rupert Bayfield, chairman, explained that only a nominal amount could
have been added to the interim, so it was believed better to employ the
funds in the business.
Turnover was 7 per cent down at Pounds 62.7m (Pounds 67.7m). Operating
profit fell to Pounds 495,000 (Pounds 1.22m) but interests payments came to
Pounds 350,000, up 61 per cent on 1991. Gearing was 92 per cent (52 per
cent).
The group started life as a computer recruitment agency and a recruitment
service is still provided in the UK; the bulk of the business, however,
involves supplying consultants in the US and UK.
The business has been hard hit by the recession in both markets; in 1989,
for example, pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 4.22m.
Mr Bayfield said the group returned to profitability in the second half of
1992. In the UK, which contributed 63 per cent of turnover, revenues were
back to 1990 levels, but competition and declining recruitment business
forced down profits.
In the US, the volume of business was lower than in earlier years but
reduced overheads resulted in improved operating profits.
The high tax charge stemmed from the lack of a current tax benefit in the US
on the interest on loans made to the American subsidiary.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Inchcape rises 28% to Pounds 250m on sales growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACQUISITIONS and strong organic growth helped Inchcape, the UK-based motor
and business services group, increase annual pre-tax profits by 28 per cent
to Pounds 250m.
Sales rose 39 per cent to Pounds 5.04bn in the year to December 31, boosted
by a 10-month contribution from Tozer Kemsley and Millbourn, the motor
trader it bought for Pounds 383m.
Although TKM contributed Pounds 48.3m to total operating profits of Pounds
293m, Inchcape said its underlying businesses showed organic profits growth
of 10 per cent.
Sir David Plastow, chairman, said: 'Generally around the world the economic
environment in 1992 was tough but despite this, the group was able to
produce good results. Many of Inchcape's businesses are in those economies
which have grown well during the year, while in weaker markets most of our
operations have still managed to succeed.'
Earnings per share rose 3.7 per cent to 31p. Sir David said the benefit the
group gained from Budget changes in advance corporation tax had been one of
the factors behind the decision to raise the final dividend to 8.35p (from
7p), giving a total of 13.75p (up from 11.75p), an increase of 17 per cent.
As well as adopting the new FRS 3 accounting standard, Inchcape calculated
'normalised' pre-tax profits and earnings, excluding items which had been
accounted as extraordinary under the old standard.
Under these figures, including gains on disposals of properties and
investments, earnings per share rose 18 per cent to 31.6p and pre-tax
profits by 36 per cent to Pounds 252m.
Sir David said: 'The motors business grew strongly, quite apart from the
added impetus of the acquisition of TKM. All of our franchises in Hong Kong
had an outstanding year. Toyota (GB) also enjoyed a good year and will
benefit increasingly in 1993 from the newly-opened Toyota manufacturing
plant at Burnaston.'
The marketing business side improved profits, due mainly to the Pounds 32m
acquisition of Spinneys, a group of marketing and retail companies. Fastest
growth was in the Middle East, organically as well as by acquisition, with
good results from South America, Singapore and Thailand.
In the service business stream, shipping greatly increased its turnover, but
profits fell mainly because of lower Japanese activity. Insurance offset the
lower reinsurance market with solid growth by Bain Clarkson's core UK retail
business.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Provisions take Credit Lyonnais to FFr1.85bn loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, one of France's largest state-controlled banks, fell into
the red last year with a net loss of FFr1.85bn (Pounds 223m). This followed
a steep increase in net provisions from FFr9.6bn in 1991 to FFr14.69bn in
1992 due to heavy losses on its cinema and property interests.
The loss, the fourth in the bank's history and the first since 1974, comes
at an extremely delicate time for Credit Lyonnais, which is a candidate for
privatisation.
It also poses a threat to Mr Jean-Yves Haberer, chairman since 1988 and
architect of Credit Lyonnais' ambitious lending strategy. He was appointed
by the outgoing socialist administration, and his position may be reviewed
by the conservatives.
The dividend has been cut from FFr23 in 1991 to FFr15.
Credit Lyonnais increased net banking income from FFr46.33bn in 1991 to
FFr48.97bn in 1992 in spite of the competitive state of the French banking
market.
The group benefited from Mr Haberer's successful European expansion
strategy, culminating in its recent investment in BfG Bank of Germany, and
the rationalisation of the French network. It held operating profits at
FFr13.21bn last year, against FFr13.31bn in 1991.
However Credit Lyonnais raised net new provisions to FFr17.6bn on
unsuccessful investments and sour loans, although it recouped FFr3.6bn of
previous writedowns on country debt.
Mr Haberer said 40 per cent of the new provisions related to loans made by
CLBN, its Dutch banking subsidiary from 1986 to 1990, which included its
involvement in the abortive bid by Mr Giancarlo Parretti, the disgraced
Italian financier, for MGM, the stricken Hollywood studio.
Credit Lyonnais set aside FFr2.3bn in 1992 for its cinema interests, FFr3bn
for its exposure to Sasea, the bankrupt Swiss holding company. It also wrote
down FFr6bn on property.
Mr Haberer said provisions would be lower this year. He expected the first
half of 1993 to be similar to 1992, but anticipated improvement in the
second half.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Courtaulds pensions surplus to be reduced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS, the speciality materials company, said yesterday that it would
remove Pounds 83m in surplus from its employee pension scheme, earning it an
after-tax gain of Pounds 50m for the year to March 31.
The move follows an actuarial valuation as of March 31 1992 showing that the
pension fund surplus had increased to Pounds 189m and that assets were 124
per cent greater than the scheme's liabilities.
Pension schemes are liable to tax on surpluses greater than 105 per cent of
liabilities.
The company will also use Pounds 47m of the surplus to improve benefits to
members. The remainder of the surplus will stay in the scheme and fund a
continuation of Courtaulds' contributions holiday for the next year.
Mr Michael Pragnell, finance director, said the company had taken the
unusual step of extracting the surplus in cash, rather than dissipating it
through contributions holidays, because the surplus was so large relative to
liabilities.
UK companies have largely avoided removing their surpluses in cash because
they attract a 40 per cent tax charge.
The effect of the repayment will help Courtaulds reduce its year-end debt to
capital employed by some 4 per cent at the end of its current year.
The interest accrued on the surplus in the 1993-94 year as a result of the
repayment will be cut by Pounds 7.5m from the Pounds 18.2m earned in the
current year.
The reduced interest will lower the 1993-94 operating profit credit by
Pounds 2m.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Pearson in talks with Thorn EMI over Thames TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEARSON, the media, banking and industrial group, has had exploratory talks
with Thorn EMI to buy Thames Television, the independent production company
that lost its ITV franchise last year.
Pearson, which is interested in expanding its television interests, started
talking to Thorn late last year about the possibility of taking a stake in
the proposed Channel 5. Executives noticed at the time that Pearson seemed
to be as much interested in Thames as in Channel 5.
In the end Pearson did little more than express an interest in Channel 5
mainly because the Independent Television Commission decided that under the
1990 Broadcasting Act the company could only have a 5 per cent stake. As
owner of the Financial Times, Pearson is limited to a 20 per cent stake in
commercial broadcasters in the UK. The company already owns 20 per cent of
Yorkshire Television.
Thames, which lost its ITV franchise to Carlton last year, would present few
regulatory problems. The former ITV company has become one of the UK's
largest independent producers.
Asked about the talks, Mr Frank Barlow, Pearson chief operating officer,
said yesterday: 'No comment.' But it is clear that Mr Barlow is keen to
expand Pearson's television interests and that talks have taken place
between the two companies at a high level.
At yesterday's press conference to announce Pearson's results for the year
to December, Lord Blakenham, chairman, said the company's main area of
future investment would be in the media, including television.
The company announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 150.8m for 1992, a fall of
16 per cent but considerably more than the City expected. There was also a 3
per cent rise in the total dividend to 12p. Pearson shares rose 27p to 404p.
Thorn tried unsuccessfully to sell its stake in Thames, which is expected to
have a turnover of more than Pounds 100m this year, before the latest
franchise round.
If Pearson bought Thames, apart from the rights to programmes such as The
Bill, it would acquire assets such as Reeves, a US production company, and
stakes in UK Gold, the library channel, and in the Astra satellite system
which broadcasts the BSkyB channels. Pearson has 17.5 per cent of BSkyB.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Murdoch returns to favour in the Big Apple: The billionaire
media owner's latest paperchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW times change. When Mr Rupert Murdoch last owned The New York Post from
1976 to 1988 he was vilified and lampooned as a peddler of smut. But over
the past few days - as he has executed a rescue of The Post - Mr Murdoch has
been getting a strikingly warmer reception in the Big Apple.
In fact Mr Murdoch's News Corporation is being feted by everyone, from the
paper's 700 long-suffering employees to New York Governor Mario Cuomo, a
political opponent who nonetheless has worked tirelessly to pave the way for
his return.
So close to death is the bankrupt New York newspaper that even Senator
Edward Kennedy - who in 1988 helped engineer legislation which forced Mr
Murdoch to sell The Post because of his cross-ownership of both a local
paper and television station - is now among those willing to look the other
way.
Mr Cuomo, Mr Kennedy and a handful of other influential Senators are
supporting Mr Murdoch's request for a waiver of the Federal Communication
Commission's cross-ownership rules because none of them wish to be blamed
for letting the paper die.
Yesterday, a bankruptcy judge approved the transfer of The Post from Mr Abe
Hirschfeld, an eccentric local car parks magnate, to a subsidiary of News
Corporation. .
Mr Murdoch, having cut a deal with Mr Hirschfeld at the weekend, last night
took control and was set to name an executive at his Fox Broadcasting
television network as the new editor.
The FCC will still have to rule on the waiver, and the deal would give Mr
Murdoch control for 60 days while the application is formalised. But that is
likely to be a technical detail.
The real issue for Murdoch-watchers is why this Australian-born billionaire
media owner should wish to bother himself with editorial headaches and
almost certain losses at The Post, while he builds a global film,
television, cable and print empire.
The answer, according to close associates of Mr Murdoch, is not simply
financial. As one knowledgeable adviser to Mr Murdoch put it: 'He loves it.
He has printers' ink in his veins. And he has an ego too. He is savouring
every minute of this, and he finds the prospect of jumping back into the
fray of the New York newspaper world irresistible.'
For a mere mortal the financial aspects of the detail do not look
attractive. The paper has fewer advertisers and fewer readers than the other
two tabloids - The Daily News and New York Newsday.
In the dozen years he previously owned The Post it cost Mr Murdoch a total
of Dollars 150m (Pounds 105m) in losses. Annual losses are now between
Dollars 5m and Dollars 10m.
Mr Murdoch's entry fee includes reimbursing Mr Hirschfeld about Dollars 3m,
providing an estimated Dollars 8m to cover creditors and operating costs
over the next 60 days and then covering the full-year deficit. That Mr
Murdoch is an extremely shrewd businessman is not in doubt, but he is
unlikely ever to make much money from The Post. He would, however, wield
political clout by virtue of owning the paper.
The only other plausible reason for owning The Post would be if it offered
some synergies with the rest of the News Corp stable of holdings. About a
third of the group's Dollars 10bn of 1992 revenues were in film and
television, and it could be argued that The Post can push Fox television
programmes or television can carry advertising for the paper.
Mr Murdoch says he is spending about 50 per cent of his time on Fox right
now, having taken a very hands-on role in Hollywood since the departure a
year ago of Mr Barry Diller, the Fox chairman. In a recent conversation he
sketched out a strategy in which the Fox film studio could generate products
for both theatres and for showing on Fox television as well as on British
Sky Broadcasting, the European satellite service that is 50 per cent owned
by News Corp.
Most Wall Street analysts say Mr Murdoch is among the world's media tycoons
who best understand the coming integration of electronic and print media as
what he calls 'distribution' vehicles. But that equation does not require
ownership of The Post. The real logic behind this deal may be that moguls
are also allowed to have fun.

FT  30 MAR 93 / News Corp to save Dollars 15m a year on debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH the launch of its Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2bn) refinancing, News
Corporation hopes to complete the restructuring of its bank borrowings on
more favourable terms, with an estimated saving of Dollars 15m in annual
interest payments.
The group has greatly reduced reliance on bank debt and the number of banks
from which it borrows.
In late 1990, it was forced into negotiations with its 146 lending banks and
restructured Dollars 7.6bn of bank debt.
'In practice, News Corp has reduced its borrowing costs by around  1/2 a
percentage point across the board', according to one banker involved.
Its total bank debts - of Dollars 7.6bn plus a Dollars 600m short-term
bridge-over facility - have been cut since 1991 to Dollars 3bn. This is
being refinanced with a six-year revolving credit with Chemical Bank,
Citibank and Samuel Montagu acting as co-arrangers.
News Corp was keen to diversify the structure of its debt and reduce the
number of lending banks involved. Since 1991 it has cut bank debt by raising
equity, selling assets, and issuing about Dollars 2bn of long-dated bonds in
the US. The Dollars 3bn refinancing is intended to reduce the number of
banks from 146 to a more manageable group of 30-40 relationship banks,
including the three co-arranging banks as well as News Corp's main banks in
Australia - Commonwealth Bank of Australia, Westpac and National Australia
Bank.
The upgrading of News Corp's ratings recently by Standard &amp; Poor's from
sub-investment to investment grade means the group can borrow at more
favourable terms.
Under the provisions of the 1991 agreement, lenders received 100 basis
points (one percentage point) on top of their previously-agreed terms.
With the new loan, News Corp will pay a margin of 100 basis points (bp) over
the London interbank offered rate (Libor) in the first year, provided it has
an investment grade rating from either S&amp;P or Moody's.
The margin in subsequent years is determined by the company's credit rating.
Moody's currently rates News International as speculative grade at Ba2.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Courtaulds to take Pounds 83m surplus from pension scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COURTAULDS, the speciality materials company, said yesterday that it will
remove Pounds 83m in surplus from its employee pension scheme, earning it an
after-tax gain of Pounds 50m for the year to March 31.
The move follows an actuarial valuation as of March 31, 1992, showing that
the pension fund surplus had increased to Pounds 189m and that assets were
124 per cent greater than the scheme's liabilities. Pension schemes are
liable to tax on surpluses greater than 105 per cent of liabilities.
The company will also use Pounds 47m of the surplus to improve benefits to
members. The remainder of the surplus will stay in the scheme and fund a
continuation of Courtaulds' contributions holiday for the next year.
Mr Michael Pragnell, finance director, said the company had taken the
unusual step of extracting the surplus in cash, rather than dissipating it
through contributions holidays because the surplus was so large relative to
liabilities.
He said they had reached the point 'where there were a limited number of
things we could have done with our surplus'.
UK companies have largely avoided removing their surpluses in cash because
they attract a 40 per cent tax charge.
The effect of the repayment will help Courtaulds reduce its year-end debt to
capital employed by some 4 per cent at the end of its current year.
The interest accrued on the surplus in the 1993-94 year as a result of the
repayment will be cut by Pounds 7.5m from the Pounds 18.2m earned in the
current year.
Also, while there will be no effect on current year pre-tax profits from the
effects of this year's contributions holiday, the reduced interest will
lower the 1993-94 operating profit credit by Pounds 2m.
In December, Courtaulds Textiles said it would restructure its pension
scheme to reduce a surplus of 55 per cent of liabilities.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Russian Congress fails to end constitutional power struggle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and LEYLA BOULTON

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA was braced last night for a prolonged constitutional crisis as the
ninth Congress of People's Deputies ended with no resolution of the power
struggle between president and parliament.
The parliament's last act was to pass a resolution calling for a referendum
on April 25 - the date originally set by President Boris Yeltsin but on
terms he is unlikely to accept.
Mr Vyacheslav Kostikov, his press secretary, said Mr Yeltsin would be likely
to conduct his own poll of voters, separate from the referendum proposed by
the Congress.
Mr Kostikov's comments, together with his earlier attack on parliament as a
lawless body and other statements by presidential aides in the last three
days, point to a resolve by Mr Yeltsin's team to ignore parliament's
decisions. One adviser said last night the president had no choice 'but to
carry out his own ballot with his own questions'.
The Congress resolution would put four questions on the voting paper: the
issue of trust in the president; the acceptability of the economic reforms
Mr Yeltsin has introduced; whether early presidential elections should be
held; and whether early elections should be held for parliament.
The sting lay in the high participation qualification introduced by the
Congress. Instead of the normal condition that at least 50 per cent of the
electorate take part in a referendum, the deputies laid down that at least
50 per cent of the electorate must vote one way or the other before any
decision was accepted.
This would be an all-but-impossible level to achieve, especially given the
political apathy in the country.
The main effect of the Congress has been to obscure further the
decision-making process.
Earlier yesterday the deputies passed a resolution calling for Mr Yeltsin's
decree allowing him to rule without challenge from parliament to be referred
to the Constitutional Court. They also called for his aides and
representatives in the regions to be sacked. This followed a resolution on
Sunday putting television and radio stations under parliament's control.
Mr Vyacheslav Bragin, chairman of the main Ostankino TV station, said this
would be challenged in the Constitutional Court. Mr Yeltsin has also said he
will refer to court the attempt by Congress to impeach him.
In remarks intended to show Congress's determination to act as the bulwark
of democracy, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the speaker, closed the session by
saying that 'if the plan of the president's team had succeeded, we would
have gone back to the worst of times of totalitarianism, the splitting of
society and maybe civil war. For the first time in Russia we have managed to
prevent unconstitutional actions, but their thrust has not yet been
completely stopped.'
Meanwhile, the west continued yesterday to wrestle with the consequences of
Russia's collapsing economy and political turmoil.
Mr Jacques Attali, chairman of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, warned in Moscow that the West should not allow Russia to
unravel as Germany did in the 1920s and 1930s by insisting on heavy debt
repayment.
He added: 'This country cannot be managed for long on the basis of mutual
disdain - there needs to be a clear decision-making process including an
effective executive and a clear role for the legislature.'
Mr Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, urged Mr Yeltsin to resist the
temptation to put political reforms on the back-burner while concentrating
on economic problems.
Economic and political liberalisation went hand-in-hand, he said.
In a speech in Bonn Mr Hurd backed Mr Yeltsin's 'courageous economic and
democratic programme' and said the West must not give up on Russia.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Italian mini-budget likely to deal with deficit overrun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM and JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government is expected within the next few days to announce
details of a mini-budget raising L13,000bn (Pounds 6bn) to correct an
expected overrun in the L150,000bn budget deficit projected for 1993.
At the same time the government has taken the unprecedented decision to
present the 1994 budget by this July. This could clear the way for an early
election in the autumn. The annual budget is normally submitted at the end
of September, complicating any electoral calendar in the autumn.
The moves came amid indications that an early change of government is
likely, given political and economic uncertainty following developments in
the corruption scandals affecting former premier Mr Giulio Andreotti.
President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro has called a meeting for today with the
leaders of the Senate and Chamber of Deputies and is expected to explore the
possibility of finding a government with broader parliamentary support
before April 18, the date set for referendums on constitutional change.
Another blow for the Christian Democrat party, the largest in the ruling
coalition, came with the resignation from its ranks of Mr Mario Segni,
leader of the Referendum Movement.
Earlier, concern about the rise in the budget deficit and political
anxieties weakened the lira. It closed at an historic low against the D-Mark
of L987.6, some L11.5 down on the day. Dealers said the Bank of Italy
intervened to buy the currency, which ended above its worst for the day of
L991.5. Italian government bonds came under pressure.
Treasury officials said they recognised the markets were nervous, but
insisted market sentiment was being driven by the country's political
upheavals.
Among the corrective measures proposed are an increase in VAT on second
homes, higher duties on the resale of used cars and advance payments of the
tax on the use of gas, as well as further spending cuts.
The government has had to act quickly because it has undertaken with the EC
to comply with its original budget in order to receive an Ecu8bn (Pounds
6.6bn) loan. The first tranche of this has already been drawn down.
The agreement with the EC locks Italy into a straitjacket of tough fiscal
measures, as the recession has led to a shortfall in receipts projected at
L14,500bn. Spending has risen because of higher social security and
unemployment costs, while no income has yet come from privatisations.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Mubarak accuses Iran over bombings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Hosni Mubarak of Egypt yesterday accused Iran of attempting to
destabilise his government by sponsoring recent bombings and attacks on
tourist targets in the country.
'For sure, Iran is fundamentally behind this,' Mr Mubarak said in an
interview with the Financial Times.
Mr Mubarak's remarks are the most explicit allegation he has made of direct
Iranian attempts to bring down his government. They mark a further
deterioration in relations between Egypt and Iran after sharp exchanges
between the two governments earlier this year.
The president warned remaining Iranian diplomats in Cairo that they were
being closely watched and he would not hesitate to throw them out if there
was evidence linking them with the wave of bombings.
Mr Mubarak avoided making a direct connection between Iran and the bomb
attack on the World Trade Centre in New York last month, but added that an
Egyptian returned to the US last week to face trial had provided 'full
information' about the group which was responsible.
He said Mr Mahmoud Abu Halima, one of five men held in connection with the
New York bombing, had given details about alleged quarrels over money that
he had with Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, the Egyptian cleric who has denied any
involvement in the explosion.
Mr Mubarak, who tomorrow visits Germany before travelling on to Britain and
the US, said the men responsible for recent attacks in Egypt had previously
been in Afghanistan, were trained by Iran and had gone via Sudan and Libya
to Egypt.
More than 40 people have died in clashes this month between Egyptian
security forces and Islamic extremists. Mr Mubarak said the violence had
been 'very shocking' but pledged it would not destabilise his government.

FT  30 MAR 93 / National Grid plans Pounds 300m cable link with Ireland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Grid and Ireland's Electricity Supply Board are planning to
build a Pounds 300m high-voltage link under the Irish Sea.
The cable - with a proposed capacity of 600 megawatts - would connect the
Irish grid to the rest of Europe for the first time. It could also provide a
much-needed export opportunity for the UK's coal-fired power stations in the
future.
If the interconnector ran full-time at full capacity from Wales to Ireland,
it would consume power approximately equal to the coal produced by one mine.
In real operation, it is likely to account for about half the output of one
pit.
National Grid and ESB have just completed an economic appraisal and
engineering study of two possible routes. Surveys of the sea bed show the
cable could run from Dublin to Anglesey in north Wales or from Wexford to
Pembrokeshire in south Wales.
The next stage will be to arrange financing. According to the provisional
timetable, the project could be approved within a year; construction would
then start in 1995 and electricity would flow in 1998.
The two parties expect the EC to make substantial funds available, in
keeping with its policy of encouraging a Europe-wide transmission network.
Earlier this month the EC agreed to contribute Pounds 61m towards the cost
of a smaller 250MW link between Scotland and Northern Ireland.
The electricity systems of Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic have been
isolated since the 1970s when the cross-border interconnector was taken out
of commission after repeated attacks by the IRA. It is unlikely to be
reopened unless the overall security situation improves.
ESB is keen to end its isolation because Ireland's electricity consumption
is still growing steadily and an international link is a much cheaper and
more flexible way of meeting peak demand than building power stations. The
proposed connection with Wales would expand Ireland's present generating
capacity of 4,000MW by 15 per cent.
The link would be able to send power in either direction, depending on the
relative price and demand for electricity in the UK and Ireland. But Mr
Steve Drummond, head of interconnections at National Grid said: 'We are
predicting that it will be used mainly to export to Ireland. There will be
an opportunity for coal to provide an extra 600MW of electricity in the late
1990s.'
Whichever route is chosen for the link, National Grid faces heavy
expenditure to minimise the impact on the Welsh landscape.
Rather than build an obtrusive line of pylons, the company is likely to bury
the cable underground from the point where it comes ashore to the substation
where it joins the grid.

FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Credit Lyonnais
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of privatisation certainly gave Credit Lyonnais an incentive to
clear the decks by maximising its provisions for 1992. Even so, there is no
guarantee recovery will be rapid from now on. The FFr14.7bn (Pounds 1.85bn)
net new provisions declared yesterday were large, but probably also
represented the most the bank could afford given its weak capital position.
The bank's tradition of secrecy about its provisions leaves room for doubt
about how far it had fallen behind on covering big international risks such
as Olympia &amp; York, MGM and Sasea. Even if these provisions are now adequate,
conditions are deteriorating in the domestic market, particularly in
property lending. Interest rates will almost certainly not fall in time to
prevent more losses from that quarter in 1993. A higher incidence of
non-performing loans will be a drag on operating income. All in all, the 60
per cent jump in the share price since last November looks premature.

<TEXT>
It was perhaps predictable that Eurotunnel and TML would squabble about the
interpretation of the International Chamber of Commerce's findings on
disputed cost over-runs for the Channel Tunnel. But the outcome must rank as
something of a moral victory for Eurotunnel.
It will, nevertheless, prove cold comfort if it only prolongs the dispute
and delays the tunnel's opening. Eurotunnel would then start racking up
additional costs of perhaps Pounds 3m a day by the year-end, which would
alarm its bankers. The financial pain is also becoming acute for some
contractors as they are forced to swallow greater provisions. The dispute is
developing into one that neither side can afford to lose. That will make it
all the more difficult to resolve.

FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Lucas Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Try as it might, Lucas cannot disguise the disappointment in its first half
results. Exchange rate movements accounted for nearly all the 12 per cent
increase in sales as well as a large chunk of the Pounds 7.8m increase in
operating profit. Demand for the company's products is sagging and prices
are under pressure. Lucas insists that its rationalisation is proceeding
apace, but the full benefits are still years away.
Meanwhile, the company continues to eat up cash. Details are scant but it is
a measure of the extent to which debt rose in the first half that the
interest charge increased in spite of a Pounds 4.1m benefit from termination
of an interest rate swap contract. Lucas needs the income from disposals to
meet the continuing cash costs of restructuring and to pay its dividend.
The logical response would be to cut the dividend. But Lucas is obviously
worried about a bid. This gives the shares some support. Either Lucas
struggles through, in which case the yield of nearly 7 per cent is
attractive. Or it fails and a predator snaps it up. Such an assumption may
be rash, though. Lucas has come late to restructuring, but a predator might
not do any better in today's difficult markets. Lucas may yet have to cut
its dividend and still end up fending for itself. Curiously the bid
speculation is fuelled above all by the company's own behaviour: the outside
world is strangely silent.

FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Sun Alliance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It comes as a relief that Sun Alliance has found a use for surplus capital
tied up in Codan, its Danish subsidiary. With minority shareholders to
consider, the funds could hardly be syphoned back to plug holes in the UK
balance sheet. Yet previous attempts at using Codan as a vehicle for Nordic
acquisitions have fallen flat. Buying the insurance and financial services
business of Hafnia from its collapsed holding company - at a price close to
book value - thus looks like a good deal. Sun Alliance gains market
leadership in Denmark at minimal cost to its depleted solvency ratio.
The wonder is that Codan's winning bid was not pitched further above net
assets. But Hafnia's problems - like those of Skandia and Baltica - stemmed
from disastrous attempts at empire-building. The plight of the holding
company may have eroded some goodwill in the insurance market. But with
considerable scope for cost savings, Hafnia and Codan combined should still
show a decent return on capital.
That alone will not reverse Sun Alliance's fortunes. Next week's preliminary
figures will doubtless confirm that exposure to mortgage indemnity insurance
remains a millstone. Some solid overseas earnings would make such blunders
easier to bear in future.

FT  30 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Inchcape motors ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Management gurus may preach the virtues of focused businesses these days but
Inchcape puts in a strong case for the attractions of diversity. The
company's broad geographic and product spread enabled it to skirt regional
recessions and register a 28 per cent increase in annual profits, on a FRS 3
basis. Under new management, the sprawling trading group has evolved into a
safe, yet aggressive, international investment. Many of its activities,
which span water-testing services in the US to distributing Toyota cars in
the UK, have a defensive feel. Yet Inchcape is one of the few UK companies
with a substantial exposure to the fast-growing markets of southern China.
Last year's results were boosted by acquisitions which accounted for
three-quarters of the 41 per gain in operating profits. Still, the
underlying profits growth was robust. The company should seemingly be a
significant beneficiary of sterling's devaluation since it generates 77 per
cent of its profits overseas. But this equation may not be as simple as it
seems. Many Japanese companies are struggling to maintain their price
competitiveness because of the strength of the yen. Inchcape is unlikely to
escape its share of the margin pain.
There are certainly enough opportunities to keep Inchcape motoring in the
future. But, in the short term, there should be more share price excitement
elsewhere. The company's shares have shot ahead since the acquisition of
TKM. But Inchcape now trades on a similar rating to some of the likeliest
recovery shares. Their depressed earnings should bound ahead faster if the
UK's tentative economic revival is sustained.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Hats off to the revolution: Tony Walker returns to China
after an absence of 10 years to witness an explosion of pent-up
entrepreneurship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is near midnight at the karaoke bar, and on an elevated stage girls are
singing a discordant You Are My Sunshine. Meanwhile, the ladies of the night
are brazenly plying their trade among visiting Hong Kong and Taiwanese
businessmen.
Elsewhere in Asia, the scene might be unremarkable, but in the heart of
Beijing it seems downright bizarre, especially since the discotheque
occupies a site where, less than a decade ago, stood a drab, Soviet-style
hotel whose doors would be closed by about 10pm.
Coming back to China after an absence of 10 years produces a sensation akin
to what it might be like to be placed in a time capsule and jolted forward
at tremendous speed. Many times, in the first days, this reporter had
considerable difficulty reconciling some of what he was seeing and hearing
with memories of the past.
Simple things made the most immediate impact, such as the view from the
bedroom of the down-at-heel seventh-floor apartment which, as a family, we
had vacated all those years ago, never expecting to return. But now,
although the surroundings were familiar - perhaps too familiar - the outlook
had changed.
Whereas, before, the vista was one of endless rows of anonymous workers'
dormitories, in their place had sprouted modern, high-rise structures
replete with blinking neon lights, including a particularly intrusive
Samsung sign.
The main thoroughfare outside, which becomes Chang An (Heavenly Peace)
Boulevard as it approaches the central Tiananmen Square to the west, is not,
alas, nearly as peaceful as it used to be. One of the comforting sounds of
the past - muffled hooves of horses and donkeys dragging vegetable carts to
market - has been replaced by the roar of trucks through the night.
Traffic, hardly intrusive all those years ago since there were few cars on
the road, is catching up with the rest of the world. Traffic jams are now a
fact of Beijing life, and are certain to become worse if the city is awarded
the Olympic Games in 2000, necessitating a huge capital works programme.
Among a kaleidoscope of new developments, new impulses, new sensations,
including a dramatic alteration to Beijing's physical appearance, it may be
that the most profound - indeed revolutionary - change has been one of
attitude among ordinary Chinese.
Put simply, the entrepreneurial energy of a big slice of mankind has been
liberated. The grinding conformity, which prompted some writers
insensitively to liken the Chinese to 'blue ants', has gone, to be replaced
by a diversity that should augur well for the future if people continue to
be given reasonable freedom to test the system's commercial limits.
An interesting sign of the times is the disappearance of the word tongzhi,
or comrade, from everyday use. Ten years ago, it was a handy all-purpose way
of addressing both males and females, but now it is resented, partly, one
suspects, because of its odious associations with a politically repressive
past.
Whatever happens, the freeing of one-fifth of the world's population from
the burden of ideology and dogma, assuming that the new flexibility is
irreversible, may well prove the most important development of the late 20th
century - although it would be foolish to predict that all will go smoothly
in China, or that further upheaval will be avoided.
In 1983, when I left Peking - this newspaper along with most others had not
yet made the shift to Beijing - the Chinese were still wrestling with Mao
Zedong's awkward legacy, with its emphasis on debilitating class struggle.
At the same time, people hesitantly adopted the new battle hymn of paramount
leader Deng Xiaoping and his reform-minded supporters embodied in the
slogan: 'Practice is the sole criterion of truth.'
Ten years later, the flickering debate about Mao's contribution to the
revolution - he was judged 70 per cent 'good' and 30 per cent 'bad' by
former comrades - has all but been extinguished. And China has developed in
ways that would have been unimaginable a decade ago, and were probably
unthinkable in the bleak days after the 1989 massacre of pro-democracy
activists in Tiananmen Square.
Not that one can avoid noticing ominous echoes of the past in some official
attitudes, and in restrictions that continue to be placed on foreign
reporters. Never mind that Beijing is awash with banners proclaiming that a
'more open' city awaits nomination for the 2000 Olympics.
A recent article in an official magazine by the head of the State Bureau of
Secrecy - yes, such a body does exist - urging an overhaul of 'secrecy
policy', did not argue, as might have been expected, for less secrecy but
rather for increased vigilance now that China had been opened to the outside
world. These regressive views indicate that, behind the glitter of economic
reform and quite bewildering changes in some areas, old habits and attitudes
die hard.
In one important respect the China of today is not so very different from
the one I remember. Even at the grimest moments, there has always been an
'otherworldliness' about the place, as if a visitor has joined Alice in an
Oriental Wonderland. Thus, Beijing's elaborate Olympic Games bid has not
been without its contrived and farcical moments.
While ideology plays a much less conspicuous role in Chinese people's lives,
it remains an important prop for China's rulers who have spent much of the
past decade groping for a new formula that would allow maximum economic
flexibility and yet not be seen as an embarrassing repudiation of the past.
Not until October last year at its 14th Congress did the Communist party
finally adopt the Dengist formulation - socialist market economy - to affix
a formal seal of approval to China's move towards a market economy.
For China's reformers, and the diminutive Mr Deng in particular, it has been
a long and frequently bumpy road since the reform phase began in earnest at
the 11th Party Congress in October 1978, two years after Mao's death. A
decade and a half later - a mere blip in China's history - arguments about
Mr Deng's primacy have become redundant; and socialism has been given
'Chinese characteristics' - to borrow the inventive Mr Deng's phrase.
All this marks a big leap from the bleak winter of 1979 when I arrived in
Peking to find that the city's vast Tiananmen Square was still dominated by
portraits of the four 'wise men' - Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin; the
all-important process of officially demystifying Mao had barely begun; the
scars of the Cultural Revolution had far from healed; the Mao-appointed
acolyte, Hua Guofeng, was still nominally in charge; and the late chairman's
wife and three of her cohorts were awaiting trial for alleged 'crimes'
committed during the 10 years of madness to 1976.
What was under way in the spring of 1980, however, were the first, faltering
steps towards the creation of a market economy; and this had begun,
appropriately enough, among the peasants in Mr Deng's own province, Sichuan,
then under control of Zhao Ziyang, who was later to become China's premier
and party boss before his fall in 1989 at the time of the Tiananmen Square
massacre.
China's first 'free markets', as they were called, attracted a trickle of
foreign reporters who came to marvel at this new phenomenon, which involved
a fairly daring repudiation of Maoist strictures against commerce - although
it is doubtful that any of us appreciated the significance of what we were
seeing then, or could have foreseen the consequences.
Not much more than a decade later, the streets of Chinese cities, towns and
hamlets resemble one big 'free market'; and along with this explosion of
pent-up entrepreneurship has come a colossal improvement in the range and
quality of produce.
In the Beijing of the early 1980s bananas were a scarce commodity and,
during the long, cruel winters, about the only green vegetable available -
if it could be described as green - was Chinese cabbage. Now, a respectable
range of fruit and vegetables is sold on the streets . . . at a price.
Beijing's street vendors have shown no lack of enthusiasm for Mr Deng's
dictum that to 'get rich is glorious'. Nor have countless other Chinese who
have been leaving their farms for work in township enterprises, or who have
vacated steady jobs in the bureaucracy or state industry for the private
sector: what the Chinese, with their penchant for allegorical phrases, call
xia hai, literally put out to sea.
China's leaders in the post-Tiananmen Square period appear to have succeeded
in quietening for the time being the restlessness generated by the slaughter
of the pro-democracy activists. They have done this partly by repression,
but perhaps more effectively by diverting people's energies towards the
national money-making obsession.
Chinese television, which has undergone a revolution in presentation and in
choice of programmes - without trespassing from the party line politically -
is also playing its part in numbing the populace, as a young Chinese
acquaintance put it. It now serves up a steady fare of wildly popular Hong
Kong and Taiwanese soap operas; not to mention the old standard, Dynasty,
which was meant to portray American life as corrupt and venal, but whose
leading characters probably provide a model for the new Chinese
entrepreneurs, lauded in the official press.
For me, the intervening years have brought one pleasing development.
Contacts with Chinese have been made much easier; although again
circumstances are far from ideal. Back in the early 1980s meetings with
those few activists prepared to acknowledge that they might have dissident
views were extremely risky for the individuals concerned, and would involve
furtive encounters in odd places, such as the zoo.
Among the many changes that have overtaken China in the past decade,
undoubtedly the one that will have the biggest long-term impact, is the
communications revolution. Satellites have put millions of Chinese in touch
with developments outside, and no matter how hard the government might
strive to contain the information virus, the authorities are fighting a
losing battle.
One positive development has been the explosion in the number and variety of
new local publications, plus signs that Chinese reporters are being given
relatively more freedom to probe and to report; not that restrictions on
political coverage are at all satisfactory from a western standpoint.
At a practical level, too, life has been made much easier for foreign
reporters. Vast improvements in communications have simplified the task. In
1983, there was no international direct-dial phone system. Calls booked
through an overloaded exchange would sometimes take hours to come through
and, when they did, the other party was often barely audible. Now there are
IDD calls, packet switching arrangements and computer links.
Satellite television has also made Beijing seem much less isolated. The
contrast could not be greater with the early 1980s, when even BBC World
Service Radio was difficult to pick up at times, owing to heavy static.
One's first impressions of China after a long absence may not be definitive.
But there is no doubt that forces are at work that represent something out
of the ordinary. It has become a historical cliche, but the Chinese
revolution of 1949 did 'shake the world'. It is entirely possible that the
new economic revolution will do the same.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Tangled nets in Europe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEW French government will quickly have to bring France's unruly
fishermen to heel. International disputes, particularly between neighbours,
cannot be solved by such unacceptable behaviour as the seizure of ships and
the abduction of naval officers. The malaise of the European fishing
industry is much wider than the French fishermen seem to realise. The target
of their wrath, cheap imports not only from the UK but particularly from
Russia, coupled with demands to ban trade, is misplaced.
The underlying problem is that too many fishermen are chasing too few fish.
This structural problem has merely been exposed by the recent collapse in
fish prices, more the result of the recession than Russian imports. Banning
imports would both harm EC consumers, 30 per cent of whose fish comes from
outside the Community, and divert attention from the underlying problem.
The industry's plight is largely the result of advances in technology.
Fishing has become an industrialised business, using electronic gadgetry,
powerful motors and giant nets. These allow whole schools of fish to be
targeted and then scooped out of the sea.
But governments have not been willing to face up to the impact such leaps in
productivity have on the numbers of people who can be fruitfully employed in
the industry. Instead, they have tried to put off the day of reckoning by
handing out subsidies.
The result has not only been a waste of taxpayers' money but the dissipation
of the sea's wealth through overfishing. The more intensively the sea is
fished, the fewer fish can be caught because stocks cannot be replenished
quickly enough. This is why North Sea stocks of cod and haddock fell by 83
per cent in the 20 years to 1990.
The EC is belatedly trying to stop the rot. It has agreed a four-year plan
to cut the Community's fishing fleet by 8 per cent, by paying for some boats
to be decommissioned and requiring others to be tied up in port for up to
six months. While some action is better than none, the plan is woefully
inadequate given that scientists estimate that the fleet's capacity should
be cut by 40 per cent.
The problem is that the sea has traditionally been seen as a common resource
exploitable by all. Fishermen therefore have an incentive to fish as
intensively as possible, although this is contrary to their collective
interest.
The allocation of tradeable fishing rights to individual fishermen offers a
possible solution. Such an approach, which has been tried in Australia and
New Zealand, curbs overfishing and boosts fishermen's incomes. Those leaving
the industry also receive compensation, because they can sell their rights
to those who remain.
However, moving to such a system in Europe would be complicated by the
Common Fisheries Policy. Under this, the European sea is divided into zones.
In each zone, an annual limit is set for the total allowable catch for each
species of fish, which is then split into national quotas. Quotas are
determined by wrangling in the Council of Ministers with policing left to
member states.
The result is a European fish map even more balkanised than that proposed
for Bosnia. Widespread cheating on quotas has bred mistrust, so undermining
the chances of effective collective action. But governments have little
incentive to cut back overfishing unless others do the same.
However, the difficulty of creating a more rational system is no excuse for
not trying. As a first step, member states should allow the Commission to
oversee policing so that individual nations have confidence that others are
not cheating. Introducing satellite technology would make this policing
effort more effective.
As a second step, there should be a more ambitious scheme to buy fishermen
out of the industry. This would cost large sums of money. But the money
could be recouped if those remaining in the industry were sold tradeable
fishing rights once the market was brought back into balance. By increasing
the sea's natural wealth, such an approach would benefit taxpayers,
consumers and fishermen.

Have you got Mr Figgures, the treasury mandarin? No, but I have got Mr
Trend, Mr Forecast and Mr Fudge.
Veterans of Whitehall in the 1950s and 1960s fondly remember the days when
they could play Happy Families. Sir Frank Figgures, second permanent
secretary to the treasury in the late 1960s, headed the pack. Completing the
numerically-inclined family were Kenneth Forecast, director of statistics at
the board of trade from 1958-66, and Burke St John Trend. Last, but not
least, was Edward Fudge listed in Who Was Who as undersecretary at the
ministry of fuel in 1947. Contemporaries, however, remember him at the
treasury; when the phone rang, he used to bark 'Fudge' into the mouthpiece.
Wouldn't sound too out of place today.

If Coutts &amp; Co, royal bankers for centuries, had changed chairmen last year
it might have detracted from the firm's tercentenary celebrations. However,
Sir Ewen Fergusson, Britain's former ambassador in Paris, has now been lined
up for the most diplomatic job in banking - looking after the accounts of
the British establishment.
Sir Ewen, who takes over from Sir David Money-Coutts in September, is not an
Old Etonian - but he is a Scot and comes with glowing references. His job is
not as easy as it might sound. Despite its great name and connections,
Coutts has not been firing on all cylinders. The UK end of the business lost
money in 1991 and although it is back in the black it could do better.
NatWest, Coutts' clearing bank parent, has been surprisingly reluctant to
interfere. However, it did put one of its own men in as managing director
just over a year ago, and it would be surprising if Sir Ewen were given as
free a hand as his predecessor, the great great great great grandson of
Coutts' founder. Will he be given a seat on the NatWest board like previous
Coutts bosses?

Have British banks gone completely mad? First, traditional firms like
Barclays and Lloyds drop the apostrophe in their family titles, then they
abandon trusted brand names such as Martins and Williams and Glyn's by
merging with each other. Now they are trying to make new services sound
exciting by giving them American-sounding names.
Take telephone banking. Midland has Firstdirect and National Westminster has
PrimeLine. Both names have a US bank's combination of eccentric use of
capital letters, and the running of two words together. Now Bank of
Scotland, of all places, has re-named its direct banking operations
Centrebank.
Admittedly, Central Banking Services, its old name, doesn't have a snappy
ring. But if they must sound American, why not just call it Centerbank?

If there are lucky and unlucky newspaper editors, then 38-year-old Martin
Dunn, late of the Dudley Herald, falls into the former category.
Less than two years after being made editor of Today, the weakest member of
Rupert Murdoch's UK stable of dailies, he was tempted away by Mort
Zuckerman, the New York Daily News publisher, with intriguing talk of a
Dollars 500,000 package. However, no sooner had Dunn handed in his notice
than Zuckerman began to get cold feet after journalists and advertisers
reacted badly to the idea of the News being edited by a Brit.
Lesser Fleet Street editors than Dunn might have taken to the bottle. But
Murdoch took pity on his errant editor and offered him the lowly Boston
Herald. Now it seems that Dunn's time in Boston may be the shortest on
record. His proprietor seems to have fallen in love with the New York Post
once again, and Dunn has been placed on standby to go to New York.
Mort Zuckerman could yet live to regret sending the fax that could have
destroyed Dunn's career.

First the good news. The future of world trade is largely in the hands of
two men of identical age and ethnic and professional background. Sir Leon
Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, and Mickey Kantor, the US trade
representative, are both 53-year-old lawyers of Lithuanian Jewish origin.
The bad news is that since their ancestors emigrated from Lithuania, much
has happened to transform the pair into very different people: one a
baseball-loving social campaigner on the left of the Clinton administration;
the other a one-time acolyte of Margaret Thatcher with a taste for bracing
country walks.
Quizzed on their roots after yesterday's tense Brussels trade talks, Sir
Leon was cautious about the similarities. 'I don't know how much (of the
Lithuanian background) has rubbed off on the way, via Tennessee and north
London,' he said.
Certainly Kantor has acquired, via Tennessee, a mischievous sense of humour.
Asked whether he considered Kantor to be a protectionist, Sir Leon replied
diplomatically that the US trade representative was obviously 'extremely
good at protecting US interests and I hope I'm equally good at protecting
Community interests'.
Sitting next to Sir Leon, Kantor obviously decided the time had come to
respond to the commissioner's widely reported comments on his US
counterpart. 'Well, at least he hasn't called me a 'unilateral bully' or a
'bureaucratic thug' this time,' he smiled, to Sir Leon's obvious discomfort.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Gilts galore
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE face of it, Wednesday's auction of Pounds 3bn of partly paid 20-year
gilt-edged stock takes place against an increasingly favourable
international and domestic monetary background. Yet there is a problem of
credibility; and it is not confined to the sheer volume of gilts that has to
be sold to fund a Pounds 50bn public sector borrowing requirement in
1993-94.
Since sterling parted company with the exchange rate mechanism the
government has chosen to make an inflation target of 1 to 4 per cent the
centrepiece of the new policy framework for its counter-inflationary
strategy. Its aim is to bring inflation to the lower end of this range by
the end of the present parliament. That means that issuing long-dated gilts
at a yield of 8 1/4 to 8 1/2 per cent could cost the taxpayer a minimum real
interest rate of 4 1/4 to 4 1/2 per cent; and if the government is
successful in bringing inflation down below 2 per cent, the potential real
rate could reach 6 1/2 per cent. By historic standards such rates would be
appallingly costly.
One obvious solution to the funding problem would be to raise larger sums at
the short end of the market. Yet the authorities retain an aversion for
funding at short maturities, for reasons which remain obscure. Despite the
recent Budget changes in funding policy, sales of Treasury bills are still
not counted as funding. Nor does the government expect to retreat from its
practice of avoiding the sale of gilts with maturities of less than three
years.
Any Japanese investor considering the merits of a gilt yield of around
double that available on longer-dated Japanese government bonds must
therefore ask what the inscrutable British are up to. One possible answer is
that ministers do not believe their own anti-inflationary rhetoric, and fear
that the short-dated stock would have to be refinanced at higher rates
later. Another might be that the Bank of England is prey to its old worry
about being unable to deliver on its promises to the Treasury in a funding
crisis. The second concern would be misplaced in a global market, where the
only issue is the price at which supply and demand for funds are matched.
The former worry looks all too plausible. It follows that the Treasury
should either offer a better rationale for its aversion to short maturities
than it has done to date; or it should change its funding policy.

IT IS easy to be gloomy about Britain's capital city. Long-term indicators
of stress persist: rising crime, homelessness, deficient public transport
and poor state schools are the most obvious. To them, the recession has
added the echoing canyons of the property crash and a pervasive shabbiness.
The sunnier side of the street is that as the UK economy revives, London is
more competitive. Lower office rents mean fewer corporate emigrants to the
regions; the capital's long population slide has been arrested. It may be
too much to hope for a revival of manufacturing, but London's service
economy, in finance, telecommunications, air transport, tourism, culture,
the media and other 'knowledge' industries, has every chance to prosper.
One aim of London Forum, the government-initiated, business-led body
launched yesterday, is to draw attention to this more optimistic aspect. It
will focus upon the twin tasks of attracting more visitors and more
investment to London, working closely with London First, a business-led
agency set up last year to think strategically about that which London Forum
will promote.
Anyone with a stake in London will wish these two bodies well. If they can
think clearly and express themselves effectively, they will deserve to
influence policy.
What they cannot alter is the fact that London lacks a strategic tier of
government, save that conducted behind closed doors in Whitehall. Although
the government has raised the profile of its London policymaking, notably by
installing a minister for London transport, the running fiasco of the
capital's attempts to define and prioritise transport infrastructure plans,
from the Channel Tunnel link to CrossRail, scarcely commends it as a model
of effective, let alone open, governance.
The danger is that a government unwilling to think strategically itself is
sponsoring one overlapping business-led agency after another, a route which
can only lead to frustration and mutual recrimination. For example, if
London Forum is to lead the way on inward investment, what is the role of
London's nine Training and Enterprise Councils, which certainly think they
have that role? But then, Tecs were the government's bright business
'partnership' idea of distant 1990.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: The best bet that France can make
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From L VAN DEN MUYZENBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Plender's article, 'Le doomsday machine' (March 26), claims that
France should abandon its franc fort policy mainly because of probable bank
losses in property. The choice is easy: for all Frenchmen to lose overnight,
say, 20 per cent of their purchasing power, measured in D-Marks, Swiss
francs, dollars, yen. In addition is the certainty of increasing inflation
versus property losses by the banks.
Property losses by the banks will teach them that they should be more open
to invest in the risky business of industry rather than in what they have
imagined so far to be the no risk property market. Low inflation is
guaranteed to lead to industrial investment, competitiveness, and increasing
employment, with admittedly an unpredictable time lag. Devaluation is
guaranteed to lead to inflation, wealth reduction and, at best, short-term
competitive gain. The choice is easy. Long-term wealth]
Furthermore, few things are as damaging to an exporting manufacturer as that
his export profits can disappear overnight through currency fluctuations.
Almost nothing will do more to facilitate trade than fixed exchange rates.
Whether the French will succeed to maintain the parity between the D-Mark is
a gamble, but is probably one of the best bets France can make - for France
and for Europe including Britain.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Struggle to clinch a sale: Prospects for privatisation in
the Czech and Slovak republics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last year, the voucher scheme to put the assets of the now-divided republic
of Czechoslovakia into private hands held out the hope of prosperity for
millions of ordinary Czechs and Slovaks. But those who participated in the
privatisation programme - one of the most ambitious in the former communist
bloc - are now wondering when - or if - they will receive their shares.
Investors were given a jolt last week when the Czech government announced it
was preparing to seize shares in Czech industry due to be allocated to
Slovak investors. The move reflects a deterioration in relations between the
two new republics arising from a bitter dispute over the allocation of
assets belonging to the former Czechoslovakia - ranging from national
reserves to state buildings.
Under the privatisation scheme, applicants bought vouchers which they could
use to bid for shares. Every citizen aged 18 or more could buy one voucher
book for Kcs1,035 (USDollars 35) - roughly equivalent to a week's wages.
Each book was worth 1,000 investment points to be used to bid for shares in
five bidding rounds. The first round was held in June 1992, and the final
round was held last December. Shares were to be transferred, starting
yesterday, but distribution has been delayed until after Slovak investors
have been identified.
The Slovak government reacted angrily to the announcement from Prague, but
ruled out retaliatory action. The move also dismayed investment fund
managers who believe the action could undermine confidence in the nascent
Czech stock market.
The Czech government insists its privatisation programme will not be
affected; shares will be transferred to Czech investors after what it hopes
will be only a short delay. Slovak investors will be given partial
compensation. None the less, uncertainty surrounding the scheme has been
heightened.
No one knows quite what to expect when the shares are finally transferred.
Officials hope the programme will give birth to a lively securities market
and bolster the countries' emerging market economies. But some economists
warn of a collapse in share prices from their nominal values and of
confidence in capitalism.
The truth probably lies somewhere in between, with winners as well as losers
among the 8.5m investors who bought stakes indirectly in 1,500 companies
with an estimated book value of more than Dollars 10bn. A handful of
financial institutions will make big gains. Many small investors may jump at
the opportunity to make a quick profit by cashing in their shares, while
others, with stakes in heavily loss-making companies, will be left with
worthless paper. In the background, foreign investors are watching closely.
The decision to privatise state industry through a voucher scheme was the
preferred option of the Czechoslovak government because it believed it would
provide the widest possible dispersion of assets.
Initially, the government's offer met a lukewarm response. But interest grew
when Prague-based Harvard Capital and Consulting (HC&amp;C), a private
investment fund, offered to buy portfolios from investors for 10 times the
nominal price of their voucher books one year after the distribution of
shares. Other funds followed, offering similar or higher returns. The
prospect of certain profit enticed inexperienced investors to buy vouchers
and leave it to the funds to make the investment decisions.
The response to the funds' offers created an unexpected concentration of
privatised assets. According to a recent report by PlanEcon, the US
consultancy group, the nine largest funds - there are more than 400 -
control almost half of all investment points. By contrast, direct investment
by individuals accounts for only 28 per cent of vouchers.
'What you have is not a new class of entrepreneurs, but a change in
ownership. Instead of government ministries, the bulk of what was privatised
is now controlled by a small group of private institutional investors,' says
Mr Jan Vanous, president, of PlanEcon.
Mr Jiri Skalicky, Czech privatisation minister, is cautious about
interpreting these developments. 'I cannot say that I'm happy with this
situation, or not. What is important is how the voucher funds will operate
and act as managers.'
Individual funds cannot hold more than 20 per cent in privatised companies -
those with larger stakes must sell surplus shares by the end of the year. Mr
Skalicky says this will ensure single investors cannot block decisions. But
funds have already joined forces in some companies to impose management
changes.
'The funds don't have share certificates yet, but they're acting like
shareholders and they want to influence the running of companies,' says Mr
Richard Surrey, an executive with Squire, Sanders &amp; Dempsey, the US law firm
which has helped to implement the privatisation programme.
But many funds are short of cash to make good their promises to investors
and will be under considerable pressure to sell shares to raise money.
Moreover, they have no experience in managing extensive portfolios or
manufacturing companies. The fear is that they will seek quick returns by
selling company assets.
Mr Skalicky says these problems should not be exaggerated. 'The funds will
behave differently. Some will focus on a smaller number of companies in
which they'll want to play an active role; others will act more like
portfolio managers. The market won't collapse.'
Not everyone agrees. 'The market is shallow. If funds have to sell shares,
it will cause problems, though there are lots of foreign investors waiting
exactly for that to happen,' Mr Surrey says.
Foreigners could not invest directly in voucher privatisation, but they will
be able to buy shares on the secondary market. 'Labour costs are about one
tenth of those in Germany. It's an ideal situation for a foreign company
wanting to buy a factory or two,' says one analyst.
Analysts expect foreign investors will have an important influence on the
market's development. 'The behaviour of foreign investors will be critical
in determining how deep the initial plunge in (share) prices is, and when
the recovery takes place,' says PlanEcon. It may also determine whether
investors think it worthwhile to hold on to their shares and whether the
objective of popular capitalism will be attained. For many investors,
however, that dream may already have been swept away by the dispute between
the two new republics.

<TEXT>
Sir, Is the chancellor's budget proposal to apply a hydrocarbon fuel duty on
orimulsion intended to encourage the building of integrated gasification
combined cycle (IGCC) clean power plants in the UK?
Orimulsion is not burnt as a fuel in an IGCC power station. Orimulsion
feedstock is gasified and sulphur and other contaminants removed from the
raw gas. The resulting clean fuel gas fed to the electricity generating
section (the combined cycle) is both sulphur and hydrocarbon free and could
not be liable for the new tax. Steam and hydrogen for nearby refineries are
possible co-products. Coal is an alternative feedstock for such a plant.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: Kenya has taken the prudent, safe step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr M NGALI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Kenya's crisis' (March 24) fails to see the abyss into
which Kenya is going into as a result of the latest reforms which were
unaccompanied by the necessary and promised balance of payments support. The
only prudent, practical and safe step was the reverse one taken which,
contrary to your belief, was motivated by the national interests of Kenya.
I believe the western governments and institutions endorsed the results of
the Kenyan general elections in December 1992 in principle because they
represented the will of the people, not because they foresaw a puppet. There
should therefore be no bitterness against the person of the president, as is
apparent in your editorial, or a suggestion for an externally supervised
general election.
Developing countries, with or without reforms backed by the International
Monetary Fund, have for many years been struggling with the deteriorating
terms of trade, inflation, unemployment, poverty and unfavourable exchange
rates. IMF reforms are therefore not the cure-all prescriptions they are
made to appear.
Kenya went the extra mile while the other side baulked on its part of the
agreement. No attempt should therefore be made to shift the blame from where
it is due.

FT  30 MAR 93 / A test for John Patten
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The secretary for education, Mr John Patten, faces a simple test this
summer. He will be required to answer, preferably on one side of a sheet of
paper, one of the following questions:
1. Why are teachers refusing to test schoolchildren?
2. A secretary for education must convince teachers that the tests required
under the national curriculum are sensible. Discuss.
3. When everyone says you are mistaken, is it possible that you are wrong?
Mr Patten appears not to know how to tackle these questions. If he fails he
should be assessed as a dunce. The first task of any education secretary is
to establish a rapport with teachers. Mr Patten has not done so. The
evidence is before our eyes, in the current of discontent running through
the staff common rooms of Britain's secondary schools.
It is important to be clear about this. I am not talking about the teachers'
trade unions, but teachers themselves. The absurdly posturing National
Association of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers, the second largest of
the six unions, proposes to boycott all the national tests due in June. The
more focused National Union of Teachers, the largest union, threatens to
sabotage the English test for 14-year-olds. It will ballot its members in
May. The Secondary Heads Association decided last week that its members will
not try to prevent disruption of the English tests. The SHA may, however,
allow headteachers to snitch on their staff, by reporting them to the school
governors or the local education authority. Either could discipline any
recalcitrant. The larger National Association of Head Teachers has hummed
and hawed. Thus do the associations of principals balance their principles.
If the above was the whole story Mr Patten would deserve support. The
correct attitude to teaching unions that call strikes or boycotts is to
thump them hard, and bankrupt them when they break the law. What is
different this time is that it is ordinary, non-loony teachers who are
unsettled. We need to understand why.
The explanation begins with the Education Reform Act, potentially the most
beneficial legislation of the 1980s. It followed a decade of dithering about
the low expectations of England's schoolteachers, many of them befuddled by
'child-centred' theories of pedagogy. The new law smashed the previously
locked door to the 'secret garden' - the little acres of classroom in which
teachers strutted like gods - and imposed a structure on the system. The
foundations of a national curriculum were laid. The next step, national
tests at various stages of a child's life, seemed to follow logically.
Teachers resisted testing even more than the idea of a curriculum imposed by
law. What they particularly disliked was testing designed to measure their
own output, rather than the progress of the children. Conservatives of the
fundamentalist-right persuasion on education wanted quick, simple written
tests, not unlike those used in public schools. Progressives of the
fundamentalist left wanted continuous assessment of children's progress,
controlled by the teachers. At the education department the assembled civil
servants rubbed their hands. They gave the left the semblance of what it
wanted, disguised as a presentation to the right.
Enter Lord Griffiths of Fforestfach. When he was plain Professor Brian
Griffiths he was adviser to the prime minister, then plain Mrs Margaret
Thatcher. Speaking for the right, he concurred with his then boss, whose
instinct was that the 10-layered, multi-choice, paper-heavy system about to
be approved by Mr Kenneth Baker, the education secretary of the time, would
eventually collapse under its own bureaucratic weight.
Mr Baker's several successors did their best to simplify the original plans.
The chief inspector of schools reported yesterday that the slimmed-down (but
still copious) tests at primary school level are working, and that the
quality of teaching of and learning by seven-year-olds has improved. His
report found fault with both teaching and assessment in secondary schools,
which are at an earlier stage of introducing the new system.
In due course Lord Griffiths became chairman of the school examinations and
assessment council, SEAC. To the proponents of simple testing its draft
English assessment schemes looked like prime examples of what they call the
'educational establishment's juggernaut'. It tested too much imagination and
too little hard knowledge, too much free-flow of ideas and not enough basic
skills. It took forever to get through. Lord Griffith tried to improve what
he found. SEAC's 1993 90-minute and one-hour tests go the other way.
Preparation requires brief reading from a slim anthology. The tests aim to
assess whether the children have been taught to comprehend what they read.
They take note of skills in grammar, the child's vocabulary, a short piece
of writing, and evidence of some prior reading. No wonder English teachers
hate them.
Mr Patten has to regain control of the argument. Just the other day the
education secretary attended a meeting at the Centre for Policy Studies
(co-founder: M. Thatcher) at which Lord Skidelsky, a member of SEAC, tore
into the system of tests, which he described as a fudge between the doctrine
that testing should be diagnostic of individual educational strengths and
weaknesses and the government's desire to measure the effectiveness of
teaching and schools. Professor Griffiths was there, as were Mr David
Pascall, chairman of the National Curriculum Council (NCC) and several other
key players.
I do not know if Mr Patten got the message. His civil servants assume
absolute control over the curriculum and testing when, later this year, Sir
Ron Dearing, ex the Post Office, merges the NCC and SEAC into a new acronym.
What the thus even more powerful education department should do is plain.
National tests should be simplified on Griffiths lines. That would give the
government its measures of performance. It would save much classroom time.
Teachers could use the spare hours for their preferred style of continuous
diagnostic assessments. Such a Jack-and-Mrs-Sprat ending could only be
brought about by a confident minister, blessed with the confidence of the
teachers. If this paragon turns out to be John Patten I shall stay after
class and write 100 lines.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: Estonia citizenship laws do not discriminate against
minorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr KULLO VENDE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader ('Russia's backyard', March 2) seems to have fallen victim
to the still powerful Russian propaganda machine. The latter's regular
allegations about the so-called 'discrimination against Russian minorities
in Latvia and Estonia' (a case being Mr Malakhov's letter to you,
'Allegation contradicts reality', March 19) have been misleading many
political analysts in the world. What some Russian hard-line politicians
call discrimination in these republics is nothing but denial of voting
franchise to non-citizens and denial of automatic citizenship to former
occupants and colonists, and to other illegal immigrants. If those people
apply for citizenship in Estonia and pledge to be loyal to the country -
also manifesting their loyalty by learning the country's language - they
will be admitted to citizenship after a short naturalisation period of two
years before, and one year after, submitting the application.
Our citizenship law has been described as one of the mildest of its kind.
All human rights are granted to all residents of Estonia and respected to
the full. This has been confirmed by several international inspecting
missions, including ones from the Council of Europe and the CSCE.
I happened to be in England on your election day last April 9, and I did not
in the least feel discriminated against when I was not offered the vote. Had
I had such an interest, would your country have acknowledged it?
Perhaps, for one person, you would. But could you imagine this situation:
the UK was occupied by another power in the second world war and remained
occupied for over 50 years, during which period 36m people were sent by that
power to colonise and rule Britain (this figure roughly corresponds to the
proportion of illegal aliens in Estonia); last April you were able to hold
your first free election since the war, although the troops of the occupying
power were still stationed in your country. Would you still have been eager
to acknowledge the interest of those millions of aliens, backed by the
occupying power, to go to the polls with you?
What you describe as a flashpoint is actually wishful thinking on the part
of Russia's hardliners whose propaganda aims at preparing the world in case
an opportunity opens to re-annex the Baltic states. Otherwise, there is no
national strife in Estonia. Of course, there are Russian-speaking people
here who rage against the loss of their former privileges as a ruling
nation. They, however, would not yet even dream of becoming citizens of
Estonia, as long as they are encouraged to dream of the restoration of the
Soviet Union. The acknowledgement of discrimination against them is one kind
of such encouragement.

<TEXT>
Sir, Contrary to Alan Smallbone's assertion (Letter, March 26) that pension
costs act against the employment prospects of the mature I would suggest he
reinvestigates.
The modern pension package is the increasingly popular 'money purchase'
scheme. It is popular because cost-conscious employers see this as an
accurate means of controlling and forecasting payroll costs, regardless of
the age or turnover of their employees. Furthermore, many of these types of
scheme are not tied to any statutory retirement age. When my grandchildren
eventually arrive I know that their first question will be: 'What was an
actuary, Dad?'

FT  30 MAR 93 / Letter: Aggrieved at support by finance directors of ACT
changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr FABIAN FINLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The chancellor has been given an excuse to bring back a surcharge on
dividend income in the guise of his Budget changes to the advance
corporation tax regime by a small group of self-serving finance directors
who have campaigned for changes in the ACT system. These directors, in
complaining about surplus advance corporation tax, have put their own
interests in building a larger power base ahead of their shareholders'
interests. They fail to recognise that any cost so incurred by the company
has always been a credit to the shareholder. Due to their campaigning, that
situation has ended and the chancellor is taking the opportunity to raise
substantial additional amounts of taxation from corporate shareholders.
I hope that the pension funds most aggrieved by this development will
exercise their substantial muscle in voting against the reappointment of any
finance director who has been a party to this campaign.

<TEXT>
Embarrassment television moves a step further down the line today with the
screening of a quiz show in which, we are assured, the competitors are all
homeless, the winner gets a 'dream house', and the losers are left to the
mercy of the streets. But don't worry; the spoof is all in a good cause.
Channel 4 is presenting Come On Down And Out (8.00) as part of its 'Gimme
Shelter' season which is focusing on homelessness. ITV's pilots for possible
new comedy series in 'Comedy Playhouse' have mostly been distressingly bad.
Today's programme, Cut And Run (8.30) is about a video company asked to film
badgers as part of a campaign to prevent development of a golf course. I was
becoming disillusioned about Philip Larkin after all the recent nasty
revelations, but if his poetry infuriates Professor Terry Eagleton he cannot
be all bad. Eagleton wades into Larkin in the latest of the 'J'accuse'
series on Without Walls (9.00 C4). The second half of this nearly always
interesting culture magazine is, again, presented by Camille Paglia, the
American controversialist, who explores 'The Lolita Syndrome'.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: 'Rigoletto' in Los Angeles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIMOTHY PFAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even two Domingos failed to raise the Los Angeles Music Center Opera's
Rigoletto - originally to have been a new production by film director Peter
Medak - above routine. Marta Domingo, the famous tenor's (and in this case
conductor's) wife, made her American debut as the producer of a beautiful if
traditional staging (originally by Zack Brown) borrowed from Washington
Opera.
At the third performance, neither Domingo seemed to have determined where
the accents fall. The distracting business of the page's entrance in Act 2
caused more of a fuss than the jester's 'Cortigiani' moments later. Mrs
Domingo confined her innovations to the serving up of Monterone's daughter -
on a silver platter born by four courtiers - in the opening scene; conjured
the nicest Sparafucile you would ever care to meet; and otherwise monitored
safety.
Conducting a frequently sluggish Rigoletto, Placido Domingo similarly showed
little interest in shaping the score or even regulating instrumental
balances, allowing the music's most obvious features to prevail over its
subtleties. Unsettling mid-aria tempo shifts kept the singers' eyes glued to
the pit. The drama and atmospherics of the final act brought out his best
work (as it did Verdi's); and in the conductor's old role, that of the Duke
of Mantua, Richard Leech made increasingly ample and attractive sounds,
although his arias lacked finish.
Justino Diaz's debut in the title role found him lacking the requisite vocal
resources. Looking out of place in a jester's costume and trying to appear
as disagreeable as possible, he alternately talked and barked the part -
until Ann Panagulias's melting 'Tutte le feste' coaxed him into song and
involvement. Her exquisite Gilda brought conviction at every appearance and
her performance had a galvanising effect on her colleagues. As she
approached the tavern, one wanted to call out to her not to go in. By the
last act Verdi was back in control and the opera reasserted its power.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: Miller's 'Maria Stuarda' - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the Opera de Monte-Carlo Jonathan Miller is engaged on a substantial
Donizetti enterprise: the so-called 'Tudor trilogy' in annual instalments.
Last year it was Roberto Devereux; Maria Stuarda has just opened at the
Monte Carlo Opera House; next year Anna Bolena completes the cycle.
Every Maria Stuarda revival is inherently interesting - the opera, patchy in
inspiration, reaches peaks of fiery excitement the equal of any in Italian
Romantic opera. In addition, this latest has developed an unexpected
topicality for British opera-goers: it will be presented at this year's
Buxton Festival, in part-replacement of the programme devised by Jane Glover
and then ditched - at the eleventh hour, and in controversial circumstances
 -by the Buxton board.
The most positive verdict I could eke out, at the close of Friday's
performance, is that with a sustained effort of preliminary re-thinking and
(if at all possible) re-casting, the show may just scrape by at Buxton. It
affords at least the secure foundation of a handsome, strongly imagined
permanent wooden set (designed by the young Israeli Roni Toren), which
manages to suggest both 'authentic' 16th-century theatre practice and a
modern economy of stage effect. Clare Mitchell's costumes are similarly well
executed. The basic production conception - each new scene a kind of
vivified picture tableau (Act 1 straight out of Hilliard) - has been
supported by the designers with precisely detailed work.
Beyond this, however, I spent most of the evening trying to figure out what
on earth Miller was up to. In one of the many aggrieved interviews he has
recently given to the British press (mainly on the subject of his
unwarranted neglect by our own opera houses), he poured out his misery at
having to work so much abroad, and particularly in Monte Carlo, whose
populace he defined as 'tax-dodging, fur-coated fools'. Could the amazing
blankness of the show, the extraordinary inertia that settled on its
characters and situation, be a subtle feat of producer's irony - an attempt
to 'place' the audience level and criticise it all at one go?
The dramatic rationale of the evening, seldom contradicted, was that the
principals ambled in to take up their positions and go through their (slow)
motions; quick-witted delivery of, or response to, words seemed out of the
question. At the opera's climax - Mary shouts 'Vil bastarda]' at Elizabeth,
who summons guards to surround her rival - the placid trotting-in of the
soldiers was a moment of unintended opera comedy of the purest sort,
although for anyone who remembers the lightning-forks of excitement John
Copley, Janet Baker, Pauline Tinsley and the ENO chorus let loose at the
Coliseum in 1973, it was a moment mixed with puzzlement and even sadness.
With a single exception the cast lacked the personality and command of the
bel canto arts necessary to penetrate the veil of minimalist direction thus
thrown over the opera (and in the routine conducting of Gianfranco Masini
there was little countervailing inspiration). Christine Weidinger (Mary), a
sympathetic but very uneven soprano, and Mariana Cioromila (Elizabeth), a
competent, vocally unyielding mezzo, sustained this rule; Keith Lewis, a
Leicester of ardent, elegant vocal style, provided its single exception.
Unfortunately, it is the leading ladies, rather than the leading man, who
will accompany this production on its transfer to Buxton.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: European Community Youth Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The main theme of Sunday's concert at the Royal Festival Hall was youth. The
event was being given in aid of the Keyboard Charitable Trust for Young
Professional Performers and the organisers had ingeniously brought together
the European Community Youth Orchestra with both a youthful soloist and a
still young conductor, at least for the second half.
Yevgeny Kissin announced his energy, boldness, youthful super-confidence
from the first notes that he played. One rarely hears the opening flourishes
of Beethoven's 'Emperor' Piano Concerto so bright and forward. The whole
performance was dominated by Kissin, even when the piano part had relatively
unimportant material, because his playing was consistently up-front,
demanding to be heard before anything else that was going on.
By chance I had not caught this concerto live for a while and one of the
last performers was Claudio Arrau, then well into his 80s. It is easy to
generalise, but these two performances really were at the opposite extremes
 -Arrau thoughtful and mellow, glowing with maturity, Kissin all unabashed
power and brilliance. The note-by-note clarity of his scales was dazzling;
his attack was metallic and forceful.
Played like this, Beethoven can easily start to sound relentlessly
triumphal, the 'Emperor' Concerto more than most. The saving grace on this
occasion was the effervescence with which the conception was carried
through. At one point in the finale, as Claudio Abbado visibly galvanised
his orchestra into matching the pianist's exuberance, Kissin let a smile
pass across his face - silent recognition that his verve had won through.
After the interval Abbado passed the baton to Mark Wigglesworth for
Shostakovich's Tenth Symphony. This is the sort of piece in which young
players can shine. The virtuosity demanded by Shostakovich is of unanimity,
of fearless attack, of bold colours, and in those categories the ECYO
musicians are pretty impressive. It is remarkable what a difference it makes
when every member of an orchestra is giving his or her all, right to the
back desk of the violas.
At the risk of pushing the evening's leitmotif too far, it is possible to
say that Wigglesworth also has a young man's view of the symphony. The first
big climax impatiently arrived too early; later outbursts sometimes ignited
spontaneously, rather than coming as the logical end of Shostakovich's long,
slow fuse. But the performance had energy and character. It was exciting in
the right, youthful way.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: The lighter hearted side of Rouault - William Packer
discusses the qualities that make this artist unique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Georges Rouault was born in 1871 and died in 1958 at the age of 87, to be
honoured in death by a state funeral in the church of St. Germain-des-Pres
in Paris. Even so, for an artist who had been so prominent in that heroic
period of the School of Paris in the first two decades of this century, he
had remained in his work, as in his life, a man apart. If he was seen from
the start, along with Matisse, Vlaminck and Derain, as one of the leading
fauves - indeed he was shown in the eponymous room at the Salon d'Automne of
1905, la cage aux fauves - his innate distinctiveness was immediately
apparent.
We all know the image, from countless posters and Christmas cards - the dark
yet oddly luminous intensity of the colour and the heavy, black delineation
of the image, which together betray Rouault's early training in the
disciplines of stained-glass: the lowering mood and heavily symbolic
religiosity of the imagery; the mournful heads and desolate figures, no less
intense.
There is much more to Rouault than that, and it is at once the delight and
the achievement of this exhibition to bring back to us the whole artist in
all the vigour and authority of his first maturity, fully alive to the
spirit of the time and yet always his own man. He had trained as a painter,
as had Matisse, in the studio at the Ecole des Beaux Arts of the great
symbolist painter, Gustave Moreau, and the show opens with a darkly brooding
self-portrait of this time, a large drawing of 1895, sadly damaged in the
last war.
In 1902, already in his thirties, he suffered a serious mental breakdown.
His recovery and return to Paris the following year mark a clear break with
the past, at least in his work. He would always remain the symbolist at
heart, in the spirit that informs his work, but a symbolist that was now, in
the immediacy of the statement and the directness of his method, a fully
fledged expressionist - which is where this exhibition starts.
What is surprising is not the change itself, the immediate mastery
demonstrated by the new approach. Munch and Ensor had been active for 20
years and expressionism was in the air. Of all French painters of his time,
Rouault is closest in feeling to what the German expressionists were doing,
or about to do - Schmidt-Rotluff, Kirchner and the rest. And yet any such
comparison can only confirm the essential singularity of Rouault's
achievement. For with all the raw visual force with which the particular
subjects are seen and presented, there is also a countervailing technical
sophistication that is entirely French - that graphic, realist tradition of
Lautrec and Degas, Forain and Daumier. It is the combination that makes
Rouault unique.
There is, too, a further surprise; for, in qualifying and moderating
Rouault's authority, both moral and technical, there is revealed in the work
a delicacy and lightness of touch, a quality of graphic knowingness and wit
that I, for one, had not expected. Once noticed, it is obvious enough. But
his work has for so long been shown in single spies, or small groups at
best, that such lightness is all too readily swamped. The works are shown
here in groups related by theme, and suddenly how much there is to relish
and enjoy in these low-life tableaux, these rows of prostitutes and
fairground Aunt Sallys, these clowns and players and lugubrious judges.
To go from the Academy to its constituents: two Royal Academicians have
shows current, though there is barely space here to do more than recommend
them to you. Adrian Berg indeed has two on the go: the larger, at the
Barbican, a retrospective tour through the particular landscape subjects
that have engaged him these 20 years and more, from Regent's Park to the
Lake District; the smaller, at the Piccadilly, of the extended series of
water-colour studies of the sea and cliffs between Brighton and Beachy Head
that occupied him through the summer of last year.
Berg is among the most adventurous and radical of our landscape painters,
nothing loath to simplify and abstract the image; to indulge colour for its
own sake; to fix upon the particular qualities of the mark to see where that
might lead; to shift his point of view within the subject, or even
physically to turn the canvas on its side and upside-down. The paradox is
that such independence of spirit is the direct function of the close
attention he invariably fixes upon his subject, immersing himself in it day
by day, even season by season. In the days when he lived high above Regent's
Park, his paintings would often follow the cycle of the year; and, the next
year, around again.
Bernard Dunstan, at Agnew's, is the most accomplished of painters and a
master of pastel, which, of all the graphic media, is the most delicately
demanding. He is an intimiste, a life-long student of Bonnard and Vuillard,
moderated by an Englishman's cooler sympathies for Sickert and Nicholson.
His subjects are the interior; the chamber orchestra in concert; the nude
caught in the morning light; and the civilised cityscape, most of all of
Venice, in all lights and all weathers. He does what he does quite
beautifully and suffers thereby in his critical reputation: for how, to the
serious-minded, can anything so charming be at all serious?

FT  30 MAR 93 / Arts: Jerry Hadley, Jennifer Larmore - Song recitals in
London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jerry Hadley's recital attracted a surprisingly small audience to the
Purcell Room on Wednesday. London's regular canary-fanciers were generally
conspicuous by their absence. The first night of Pelleas across the river
may have accounted for some of them, though that opera is unpromising
territory for canaries; otherwise the lack of response to what is by any
standards one of the most refreshingly direct and attractive tenor voices of
the present generation was hard to explain.
The biography in the programme categorised Jerry Hadley as 'highly regarded
as a cross-over artist', and his choice of programme seemed designed to
emphasise this versatility. Mainstream 19th-century repertory (Schumann's
Dichterliebe, Liszt's Petrach Sonnets) began the programme, folk-song
arrangements and modern American settings ended it. The latter came over as
more convincing, for although Hadley occasionally alighted upon a rapt,
concentrated tone for some of the Lieder - the last of the Petrach settings,
'I vidi in terra angelici costumi' in particular was wonderfully sustained
and controlled vocally  - the approach seemed too generalised and extrovert,
too full-throated, to probe beneath the surface of the songs for further
expressive layers.
Cheryll Drake, Hadley's wife, was his accompanist; she was rather plain and
unprepossessing in the art songs, more supportive in the vernacular numbers.
Britten's arrangements had been originally promised for the folk songs, but
most of this selection had been titivated in a heavy-handed way by Luigi
Zaninelli, whose unfailing trick seemed to be a canon between the piano and
vocal line in the last verse of every song.
Hadley, though, delivered them all ('The Water is Wide', 'Black is the
Color', 'Shenandoah', 'Sweet Betsy') with unaffected good humour, and also
made excellent cases for Rochberg's 'Rise Up, My Love' (strikingly
Tippett-like in its figuration - what a good job Hadley would make of The
Heart's Assurance]), a John Duke setting of e e cummings, and John Alden
Carpenter's 'Serenade'. Far from losing their subtlety and poise such
settings positively thrive on the larger-than-life qualities that seem to be
his mainstays as a recitalist.
*****
Jennifer Larmore, another American singer currently riding high in
international opera-house esteem, managed to fill the Wigmore Hall for
Sunday's recital - her first in London. Miss Larmore's mezzo-soprano is an
instrument of extraordinary beauty, at once full and agile, graceful in slow
music and brilliantly fleet in fast, its rich tints evenly spread across a
compass of more than two octaves; and since she is also fair of face and
figure, the promise of the occasion seemed immense.
In truth, it was a good deal less than completely realised. The programme -
ridiculously short measure, as is now the rule - played to the singer's
particular strengths: a group of Handel arias to show off the splendour of
her fast flourishes, French arias (by Massenet) and songs (by Gounod and
Faure) to remind us of her refined sensibility in that field (she is based
in France, and was a redeeming feature of the otherwise wretched Covent
Garden Huguenots), and Spanish songs and Rossini to provide a vivacious
close.
And yet the impression far too much of the time was of a finely schooled
singer expertly going through her paces, not an artist stirred to urgent
communication with an audience. Words were mouthed, not delivered. Phrases
were touched in, not shaped. When it came to the closing account of 'Una
voce poco fa', the sudden increase in appetite, in a sense of 'go',
underlined what we had been missing earlier. (Miss Larmore has just finished
a run of Covent Garden Barbers.) It was odd to encounter John Constable,
normally a pianist of unflappable aplomb, on such peccable form.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: A measured view on monopolies - As he
prepares to step down as MMC chairman, Sir Sydney Lipworth talks about the
commission's role as corporate policeman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Sydney Lipworth is aware of the public debate raging about the structure
of the UK competition authorities and their recent performance. But the
phlegmatic, South African-born chairman of the UK's Monopolies and Mergers
Commission is not about to let the controversy cloud his last days in
office.
Sir Sydney who steps down after Easter after more than five years as MMC
chairman is happy to let his record speak for itself.
Since 1988 the commission has published 112 reports, one-third of the total
published since the MMC was set up in 1949. That represents an average of 22
reports a year compared with an average of five a year in the previous 40
years.
In addition to its core responsibility of vetting monopolies and mergers,
the commission has taken on an extra role as arbitrator for the newly
privatised utilities, and under the Broadcasting Act, for independent
broadcasters. Yet the average time taken to complete inquiries has come down
considerably since Sir Sydney took charge.
Monopoly inquiries which used to take anything up to four years are now
dealt with in nine or 12 months as a matter of routine. Merger inquiries
which used to take six months are now completed in three. And, Sir Sydney
believes, the quality of the commission's work has more than been
maintained. 'The MMC is a first-rate institution doing a first-rate job,' he
says.
Much as you would expect from this no-nonsense lawyer turned businessman,
Sir Sydney puts up a robust defence to some of the more strident criticisms
levelled at the MMC in recent months. But his mind is not closed to change.
He is not unsympathetic, for example, to recent complaints from industry
that the structure of the UK's competition authorities results in too much
duplication of effort between the Office of Fair Trading and the MMC.
'Theoretically there must be something in it because theoretically there is
an element of duplication.' But he would need to be convinced of the actual
saving to industry before he would be prepared to change a system which has
stood the test of 45 years.
'I'm not sure a single body would produce a better analysis of a case in the
end, but it might be cheaper. The real question is: will the final result be
more or less comprehensive? I think we should look at it.'
Sir Sydney is less tolerant of the suggestion that the commission has 'gone
soft' recently in its monopoly-policing role. Critics say the MMC has paid
too much attention to the views of the companies under investigation. In
1991, inquiries into photocopiers, instant coffee and soft drinks left
monopolies largely intact. Compare that with the reports that helped to
liberalise industrial gas supply and weaken the link between brewers and
pubs in the late 1980s.
The break-up of brewing is now regarded by industry observers as having
backfired. Those who accuse the commission of going soft believe the
government's rejection of some of the more radical elements of the beer
report caused the commission to take a more cautious approach.
Criticism of monopoly investigations reached a peak with last year's report
on new cars. The Consumers' Association accused the MMC of ignoring an
independent report which showed considerable price differentials between
cars bought in the UK and on the Continent. Instead, the association said,
the MMC relied too heavily on information given by the manufacturers, which
claimed these differentials were not nearly as large in practice as the
independent research suggested.
Mr Stephen Locke, CA's director of policy, said the MMC analysis could 'only
be described as deeply flawed', and seemed 'ultimately to have been swayed
by the arguments of the manufacturers'.
These criticisms are rejected by Sir Sydney. The responses to the new-cars
report were 'superficial, knee-jerk reactions' which 'overlooked what the
report actually said'. He accuses consumer organisations of giving vent to
their frustration that the commission did not find the extensive differences
between UK new car prices and those elsewhere in the EC. 'Popular
expectation is not necessarily a good guide as to what is the right answer.
You don't need to totally restructure an industry to come up with a sound
solution,' he says.
Another reason which has been suggested for the increased caution exhibited
by the commission is the growing number of legal challenges to MMC reports.
The commission has been judicially reviewed nine times in recent years.
Again Sir Sydney disagrees. In his view the increase in legal challenges is
in line with an overall increase in challenges to quasi-judicial decisions
of all types. To a certain extent he welcomes the legal challenges. 'I'd
hate it if a court found that we had acted unfairly, but otherwise I think
it helps to keep us on our toes.'
The commission has won all nine of its judicial reviews, a record of which
Sir Sydney is proud. But in general the nine cases have drawn attention to
ambiguities in the wording of the 1973 Fair Trading Act which he says is
'beginning to look a bit dated'.
Is he in favour of wholesale reform of UK competition legislation? It has
been suggested, for example, that it is an outdated concept to decide
whether a merger should be allowed to proceed, or a monopoly allowed to
survive intact, based on whether it is in the 'public interest'.
Some competition lawyers argue that the criteria to be taken into account
when judging the public interest, as laid out in section 84 of the FTA, are
too vague. They argue the MMC needs a stronger direction to focus more
directly and rigorously on competition issues, leaving to the trade and
industry secretary wider public interest considerations, such as the
balanced distribution of industry and employment.
Sir Sydney is not opposed to reform of the public-interest test but remains
to be convinced. For all practical purposes, certainly when vetting mergers,
the 1984 so-called 'Tebbit doctrine', which made competition the primary
criterion of merger reference policy, has kept competition at the heart of
the public-interest test, he says.
Ultimately, he adds, a decision on the public-interest test is a political
one. Whatever is decided, the commission can adapt to it, he says. If the
aim was to produce a degree of extra certainty for industry in the way
mergers will be judged, then narrowing the test would be the answer. But the
present criteria for judging the public interest does offer a degree of
flexibility, allowing ministers exceptionally to refer cases to the MMC on
wider issues.
In general, however, he believes there is room for strengthening the wording
of the Fair Trading Act and improving some of its procedural tests, such as
the test for complex monopolies, which he says are 'a bit artificial'.
Where does he stand on the government's proposed reforms of UK law on
restrictive trade practices and abuse of market power?
The restrictive trade practices white paper proposed the introduction of a
prohibition on anti-competitive agreements backed up by a system of fines,
with the MMC or a tribunal of specially appointed MMC members responsible
for imposing penalties. The abuse of market power green paper envisages a
similar role for the commission in dealing with anti-competitive behaviour
by dominant companies.
Some competition lawyers and consumer bodies believe that if the MMC is to
continue to be seen as a dispassionate investigatory body then it should not
become involved in the impostion of penalties which will inevitably be seen
as harsh.
Sir Sydney welcomes the proposed reforms of restrictive practices
legislation and sees nothing wrong in principle in asking the commission to
play a role in imposing penalties. He insists the MMC already acts as a
quasi-economic tribunal and has the flexibility to do the job. Many of the
remedies, such as divestment, which it now has the power to recommend, are
just as harsh for the businesses concerned as any fine is likely to be. If
there is real concern about the imposition of large fines, perhaps the
courts could be asked to play a supervisory role, he suggests.
He is less convinced of the need for significant change in the law on
anti-competitive behaviour by individual companies, however. 'Looking back,
I'm not aware of many cases which would have called for a prohibition and
fines, as opposed to our current system.'
As he clears his desk for the last time he will reflect with some pride on
the business-like approach he has injected into the commission's work since
1988. 'I found the commission in good shape and I hope I am leaving it in
good shape,' he says. In reality, he will be a tough act to follow.

FT  30 MAR 93 / People: Amber Day picks Carr
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Amber Day has appointed a non-executive director to help restore its
credibility, damaged by last year's collapse in profits and the departure in
September of Philip Green, its controversial chairman and chief executive.
Peter Carr until recently worked in Spain, where he was chief executive of
Galerias Preciados from 1988-91, when the group enjoyed an increase in
profitability. Before that he spent 11 years, up to 1986, with the stores
group Debenhams and was promoted to managing director in 1984. He has also
worked for British Home Stores and been a consultant to a number of European
retailers.
Carr, 52, is the first of two non-executive appointments promised by Stacey
Ellis, also 52, who became chairman in January after leaving Inchcape, the
motors and business services group.
Amber Day, which owns the What Everyone Wants discount stores, is still
looking for a new chief executive, a role currently being covered by David
Thompson, the finance director. 'Credibility is beginning to be
re-established, both internally and externally,' says Ellis.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Business and the Law: Court finds French synthetic fibre aid
broke notice rules - European Court
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice last week overturned the European Commission's
refusal to examine regional aid granted by France to Allied Signal, a
synthetic fibre producer, for the building of a polyester fibre plant in the
French region of Longwy. Judicial review proceedings were brought against
the Commission by the Paris-based International Synthetic Fibres Association
and the chemical companies, Akzo, Hoechst, ICI and SNIA Fibre.
The case concerned the state aid regime applicable to the synthetic fibre
sector in the context of the regional aid rules. By a 1985 decision
(85/18/EEC) the Commission had authorised the grant of regional aid to
certain regions including Longwy. However, that decision was without
prejudice to existing or future specific sectoral aid rules.
In a letter sent to EC states in 1977 the Commission had established a
special aid regime for the synthetic fibres sector. The system of
pre-notification established was intended to prohibit aid that would
increase capacity. Regional aid was expressly included.
The regime, never challenged by EC states, was extended every two years; a
communication of July 8 1989 being the extension at the time of the
proceedings. This said the Commission disapproved in advance any aid that
would increase capacity regardless of the type of product or end-use
(textile or industrial). France granted Allied Signal regional aid to build
a plant in Longwy to make polyester fibre for industrial use, namely the
supply of European tyre makers.
In June 1990 the applicants asked the Commission to intervene. The
Commission replied that the aid was granted in accordance with regional aid
rules and had been announced before the last extension of the synthetic
fibres regime. Consequently there was no obligation to notify the aid prior
to its grant.
The court rejected the Commission's arguments that the synthetic fibres
regime was intended only to apply to textile use and had been modified to
exclude industrial use by an inconsistent 1988 decision approving aid
granted to a German producer. Neither the facts nor the texts of the
relevant measures supported this interpretation. The ECJ ruled that the aid
was subject to the pre-notification requirement.
C-313/90, CIRFS v Commission, ECJ 5CH, March 24 1993.
International Labour Organisation Chemical Safety Convention.
At the request of the Commission the ECJ has delivered an opinion under its
Treaty powers in the context of international agreements on ILO Convention
170 concerning safety in the use of chemicals at work.
The ECJ considered whether the ILO Convention falls within the scope of the
Community's competence and, if so, whether the Community's competence is
exclusive.
Applying its previous decisions in this area the Court ruled that the ILO
Convention 170 falls within the joint competence of the Community and the
member states.
The Court emphasised it was not only where Community rules had been adopted
within the framework of a common policy that the member states cannot,
outside the framework of the Community institutions, assume obligations that
might affect those rules or alter their scope. Concurrent powers of the
member states were restricted in all areas where Community rules have been
adopted for the attainment of the Treaty's objectives.
The ECJ found the Community has internal legislative competence in safety in
the use of chemicals at work overlapping the scope of the Convention.
However, to the extent that the power of EC states to apply stricter
measures than any directives adopted meant there was no conflict with
equivalent provisions in the convention, Community competence was not
exclusive.
Where EC rules such as those relating to classification, packaging and
labelling of dangerous substances were more than minimum requirement,
commitments arising from the convention could affect the Community rules.
Member states must not undertake such commitments outside the framework of
Community institutions.

AIRBUS INDUSTRIE, the European aircraft consortium, has appointed a 54-year
old German aerospace engineer as its new chief operating officer.
Volker von Tein will replace another German, Heribert Flosdorff, in the
number two position after the managing director, Jean Pierson.
Since the post of chief operating officer was created in 1989 following an
exhaustive review of the consortium's management structure, the job has
traditionally gone to a German.
Von Tein comes from Deutsche Aerospace, the German partner in Airbus. The
three other partners are British Aerospace, Aerospatiale of France and Casa
of Spain.
At Deutsche Aerospace, von Tein was general manager for space transport and
propulsion systems and has also been involved in various international
aerospace co-operative programmes.
The new Airbus number two takes over at a particularly difficult and
challenging time for the consortium which has been hit by the current
prolonged recession in commercial aviation; more than 100 aircraft orders
have been cancelled in the past 12 months.

FT  30 MAR 93 / People: British Steel: Frame steps down
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Moffat's way to the top of British Steel has been cleared more swiftly
than he could have hoped - twice over. Appointed chief executive in July
1991 after the unexpected resignation of Martin Llowarch, he now assumes the
chairmanship as well because Sir Alistair Frame is resigning at the end of
April.
Sir Alistair, who has held the position for just nine months and turns 64 in
April, is listening to medical advice to reduce his business commitments. At
Wellcome, where he has been chairman since 1990, chief executive John Robb
says the company was 'actively considering the succession to the
chairmanship' adding that it had been planned 'for some time past' that Sir
Alistair would retire within the next year or so.
His departure is a blow to British Steel, which has long been criticised for
its inbred management structure. By contrast, the arrival of Sir Alistair,
former RTZ chairman, to replace Sir Bob Scholey, then executive chairman,
had initially been greeted as a suitable injection of new blood. Last
November, the company declared a pre-tax loss of Pounds 51m for the half
year to October 3, and omitted its interim dividend. But Sir Alistair had
yet to make any impact, probably because of his brief sojourn.
The company's answer to the so-called Cadbury code, which favours splitting
the roles of chairman and chief executive, is to elevate non-executive
director Sir Nicholas Goodison to deputy chairman, alongside Sir Ronald
Halstead. Sir Nicholas, member of the British Steel board since 1989 and a
prominent spokesman in the corporate governance debate, will be 'formally
responsible' for implementing the code's requirements.
Having missed the opportunity to find another outsider to be non-executive
chairman, it now seems likely that the next search will in due course be for
a chief executive. John McDowall and Tony Pedder, only on the board since
last May, are thought likely to be candidates eventually.
A chartered accountant by training, 54-year-old Moffat (left) has been at
British Steel for 25 years, serving as finance director between 1986 and
1991.

FT  30 MAR 93 / People: Coutts' new chairman
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ewen Fergusson, the former British ambassador in Paris, is to take over
from Sir David Money-Coutts as non-executive chairman of Coutts &amp; Co,
bankers to Britain's royal family since the reign of George III.
Sir David, who joined Coutts in 1954 and has been chairman since 1976, is
the great great great great grandson of Thomas Coutts. He will remain on the
board as a non-executive director. Although it is unusual for Coutts, now
owned by National Westminster Bank, to bring in an outsider as chairman, it
is not unknown.
Sir Seymour Egerton, who was chairman for 25 years before Sir David took
over, was not a member of one of the founding families. However, he did work
in the bank for five years before becoming chairman. Sir Ewen, by contrast,
joins the board in May and becomes chairman at the end of September. He will
also be chairman of Coutts &amp; Co Group and Coutts &amp; Co International Holding
in Zurich.
A former Scottish rugby international, Sir Ewen, 60, joined the Foreign
Service in 1956. Apart from serving in the British embassy in Addis Ababa
and the British Trade Development Office in New York, his career has
included stints as ambassador to South Africa and principal private
secretary to three foreign secretaries: James Callaghan, Anthony Crosland
and David Owen.
Although Coutts has a reputation as one of the world's most exclusive
private banks, its recent performance has been lacklustre. Having made
pre-tax profits of Pounds 19.3m in 1990, it lost Pounds 15.2m in 1991,
before making Pounds 3m last year. Coutts was acquired by National
Provincial Bank in 1920, but it has remained an autonomous part of the
NatWest group for many years.
Ian Farnsworth, the managing director, has been appointed a deputy chairman
of Coutts &amp; Co from June 1, along with The Hon Nicholas Assheton. (See
Observer).

FT  30 MAR 93 / Technology: Fighting against the odds - A look at a UK
government inquiry into why so few women take up careers in science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The results of the UK government's first fundamental review of science and
technology for more than 20 years will not be known until early summer when
a white paper is published. But, already, there has been one potentially
valuable spin-off: the setting up of the first government inquiry into why
there are so few women working in science and technology, particularly at
senior levels.
The inquiry, which is operating under the aegis of the Office of Public
Service and Science - part of the Cabinet Office - is chaired by William
Stewart, the government's chief scientific adviser. Apart from Stewart, the
committee is composed of women from various disciplines.
Nancy Lane, a cell biologist from Girton College, Cambridge, has provided
the impetus for the investigation and is the person responsible for drawing
up the report on the findings. Already a member of the prime minister's
advisory team on the Citizen's Charter, she was well-placed to suggest that
the white paper address the question of women in science and technology -
the inquiry is the result.
As well as her research, teaching, and Citizen's Charter responsibilities,
Lane is a non-executive director of Smith &amp; Nephew, the healthcare group.
Her early post-doctoral experience was to be mistaken constantly for a
secretary or technician. She says: 'I was never thought to be 'the
scientist' because you couldn't be a post-doc if you were a girl - that was
obviously impossible. Things have improved and there are now many more girls
doing PhDs in the biological sciences. It's after that that they drop out,'
she says.
Figures she is gathering illustrate the point: in the biological sciences
half of graduates and contract researchers are female but only 8.5 per cent
of readers and senior lecturers and 3.5 per cent of professors are women.
Out of 537,000 qualified engineers, fewer than 5 per cent are female. In
maths and physics, a third of undergraduates and a fifth of graduates are
female but fewer than 2-4 per cent of readers and senior lecturers and 1 per
cent of professors are women.
The lack of role models in senior positions has a negative effect, according
to Lane: 'Girls must be encouraged to believe there is a potential career
for them in science and that, to some extent, depends on there being more
role models.'
The old boys' network has a grip on the positions of power, Lane has found.
'When it comes to a name for a committee or a candidate for promotion, men
rarely think of putting women forward. Sometimes, if you prick their
consciences, they agree they should try to think of one. Any woman who
actually makes it has done rather better than any man - she's got to be
startlingly good to be appointed.'
The National Health Service, with its central policy of women on every
shortlist and interviewing committee, provides a model which might usefully
be emulated elsewhere, she says, although she is anxious not to be seen as
pre-empting her committee's findings.
For women who want children, science as a career has its particular
problems. Says Lane: 'In science you have to be in a lab doing experiments
and that's incompatible with trying to work at home. Not many universities
or companies have good creche facilities on site.' For women who decide to
stop work while their children are young, Lane points out there is a
re-entry problem. 'If you're a scientist you can't just come back in as a
returner - you have to retrain because the field has moved on. You've got to
learn new techniques which have been developed in your absence.'
Academic scientists, if they take a break, have the added problem of gaps in
their publications and sometimes even age bars. 'Some of the institutions,
for example some of the research councils, have age limits for grants which
work particularly against women,' she says. 'An age limit of, say, 30 might
be fine for a man - he's got his PhD and a couple of years post-doctoral
experience by then. But a woman, even if she hasn't had children, may have
had to move jobs because of her husband's work and that may have disrupted
her research and her publications.'
Even for those women whose careers are not disrupted by marriage or
children, Lane still considers there is evidence of an inferior career
structure. 'Women are often given short-term research contracts, with
perhaps money for one to three years. At the end of that time, you don't
know what's going to happen to you. Very often women find they can't get
proper funding.'
Her committee's report will outline possible solutions to some of these
problems. For example, the idea of 'benchmarks' could be put forward. Under
these, organisations would state that by a particular date they would expect
a certain proportion of posts at a particular grade to be held by women.
Benchmarks are not the same as quotas, emphasises Lane. She has a horror of
tokenism: 'Who wants to be doing a job and to be thought to have been given
it only because you happen to be a woman?'
Members of the committee on women in science and technology: William
Stewart, chief scientific adviser; Nancy Lane, Girton College Cambridge;
Ingrid Allen, Queen's University, Belfast; Jean Balfour, fellow Royal
Society Edinburgh; Eileen Buttle, Natural Environmental Research Council;
Patricia Clarke, vice president Royal Society; Agnes Kaposi, Women's
Engineering Society; Anne McLaren, foreign secretary Royal Society; Eleanor
Linton, Cabinet Office secretariat.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Technology: Inmos in chip race
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Inmos, the UK-based semiconductor manufacturer owned by SGS-Thomson, last
week staked a claim for a place in the Guinness Book of Records as the maker
of the world's fastest single chip computer.
Its latest transputer, the T9000, is reckoned to carry out 200m instructions
a second (mips), faster than most mainframe computers and almost twice as
quick as Intel's Pentium microprocessor, formally launched in Europe last
week.
The only real competition in pure speed to the T9000, it seems, is Digital
Equipment's Alpha chip, also capable of 200 mips, which Guinness already
recognises as the world's fastest.
According to Inmos, however, transputers differ from other microprocessors
in that they have all the elements of a full-scale computer - processor,
memory and communications links - on the chip. The T9000 has 3.3m
transistors embedded in a silicon block measuring only 10mm by 20mm (the
Pentium chip has 3.1m transistors). Inmos is aiming for 10m transistors in
its next transputer family.
In small quantities, the T9000 will cost Dollars 695 (Pounds 483); the price
is expected to fall as sales volumes increase. The transputer is Europe's
only home-grown reduced instruction set computing chip; its structure makes
it particularly suitable to applications where many processors co-operate.
Parsytec of Aachen, for example, is using the chip to build parallel
supercomputers small enough to operate on a desk top. Up to 64 processors
can be connected together.
Superfast chips, however, are no longer a rarity; AT&amp;T, Acorn, Motorola,
Sun, IBM and MIPS are all in the race. Supercomputing apart, what uses has
the new chip?
Transputers have principally been used as embedded processors in
high-technology systems and the T9000 is expected to follow that trend.
Ferranti-Thomson Sonar Systems of Stockport, for example, is using the T9000
in its active dipping sonar to be built into the Royal Navy's Merlin
helicopter, where it is expected to cut processing volumes, power
consumption and overall cost.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Technology: A picture of good health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the main problems in performing successful surgery has always been
that the neat, clean laboratory models of patients' insides often turn out
to be far easier to understand than the real thing. However, virtual reality
imaging is beginning to make inroads into operating rooms in an attempt to
clarify things for the surgeon.
'It's actually more like 'enhanced reality' than virtual reality, since the
images are far easier to understand than the actual human anatomy,' says
William Lorensen, a graphics engineer at General Electric Corporation. He is
part of a team of scientists and surgeons from GE and the Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston working with virtual reality images in surgery.
The ultimate aim of the US group is to be able to project a
three-dimensional picture on to a patient's skin, allowing the doctor to
operate on the patient and the image simultaneously. The doctor would see
the image through special virtual reality glasses, which enhance
three-dimensional vision, but would actually be manipulating the patient's
internal organs.
The accuracy of the image, which precisely details anatomical parts, would
make this possible. The only essential difference between reality and image
would be the enhanced clarity of the picture. The joint project has already
produced several imaging tools to make surgeons' life easier.
Over the last few years, participants have been working with
three-dimensional pictures of patients' skulls and brains. The images are
produced by taking two-dimensional magnetic resonance and CAT-scan pictures,
converting them to three- dimensional ones with advanced computer graphics,
then using a video mixer to produce a television image.
The new images on the video monitor have already proved an invaluable tool
in pre-operation planning. Using an electronic scalpel on the television
screen, the physician can simulate surgical cuts, showing exactly which area
a particular skin incision will reveal. In brain surgery, it can help
physicians plan a safe path to a tumour, avoiding contact with motor strips,
for instance, that could leave a patient paralysed.
It can also help in facial reconstruction techniques, showing surgeons how a
bone should be cut and repositioned. The process has already been used in
planning several operations to help correct serious deformities in organ
structure.
More recently, surgeons started to use the video monitor not only before
surgery, but also in the operating room. In brain surgery, for instance,
doctors have used the monitor to mark areas on a patient's shaven head. The
marks show the surgeon where to make the incision, the location of the
tumour and which areas to avoid. The surgeon relies on this map to make the
correct incisions and uses the video monitor as a reference throughout the
procedure. Inadequate technology has prevented doctors from taking the final
step to an actual virtual reality operation, says Lorensen. 'In a pure
virtual reality operation, we would project the image directly on to the
patient's head,' he explained. 'But right now, the lighting and clarity is
not sufficiently developed.'
Similarly, virtual reality glasses need to undergo some improvements before
they will become a viable option in the operating room. 'Current eyeglasses
are too bulky,' says Lorensen. 'Before they can be used, they will need to
be lighter and less intrusive.' Even so, he predicts the procedure is only
about two years away from becoming a reality. 'We're just waiting on a few
technological improvements.'

FT  30 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Inventive ways with
financing - In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A tough fund-raising climate is forcing venture capital companies to become
ever more inventive in obtaining finance. Baronsmead, a medium-sized,
independent venture firm, has devised a funding programme which draws on
investors' money on a deal-by-deal basis and allows investors to withdraw at
any time.
The Direct Equity Programme will also allow investors to choose, within
reason, the companies their money is invested in. Baronsmead will take a 20
per cent stake in any capital gain and also 20 per cent of income received
from investments. It expects this share in income to amount to about 2 per
cent of invested funds, against the 2-2 1/2 per cent management fee normally
calculated on funds under management.
Two investors, the Merseyside Superannuation Fund and GRE Asset Management,
have put up more than Pounds 5m, though investments of between Pounds
500,000 and Pounds 1m will be more typical.
Baronsmead, which has Pounds 60m under management, initially started a
conventional fund-raising drive, but switched to what it believes is a more
flexible programme. Investors may withdraw before or even after their funds
have been invested, though this may require Baronsmead to dispose of
investments at short notice.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Management (The Growing Business): Getting the green light -
A look at three companies which have become environmentally aware
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HESTER THOMAS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Coming from South Africa to manage Berger Aus Berg, manufacturers of metal
drum closures in Peterlee, Co Durham, Richard Swart arrived with fresh eyes.
He was immediately aware of the UK's different seasons and dark winter
afternoons, plus the toll they take on energy consumption - not least of all
in his factory.
At the same time, Swart discovered that while environmental issues are not
as high on the South African agenda, in the UK his company was operating in
the packaging industry - which is acutely environmentally conscious. Linking
the need to tackle Berger Aus Berg's energy consumption with a need to learn
more about environmental issues, he decided it was time to review the
company's environmental practices.
Increasingly, companies are paying more attention to their environmental
performance. While many do it to ensure they are meeting UK and EC legal
requirements, others are interested in quantifying their environmental
impact and using the information to maintain good relations with their local
community, customers, suppliers or even investors. Companies which have
their sights set on achieving BS 7750 - a recently published British
standard for Environmental Management Systems - or other similar schemes,
know they must first set their house in order.
Ironically, when Hedda Bird formed Conservation Papers in Reading in 1988
the last thing she thought about was 'making the company greener than
green'. This was despite the fact that it was operating in an
environmentally conscious area, marketing recycled paper to the business
community. Yet within six months her attitude changed. 'Everyone - including
us - rapidly became much more sophisticated and knowledgeable about
environmental issues,' she recalls.
Three years later, Dorothy Mackenzie formed the London-based marketing
consultancy Dragon International, which is run on environmentally friendly
lines. 'We provide environmental consultancy,' explains Mackenzie, 'and to
have credibility with clients we needed to practice what we preached.'
Although all three companies have analysed their environmental practices,
only Berger Aus Berg has paid for an independent environmental review. Last
summer it commissioned Groundwork Foundation's Environmental Review Service
to see what environmental improvements could be made. The review took three
days with Groundwork - which is supported by the Department of Environment,
BP and the Countryside Commission - looking at energy use, waste management,
legal compliance, recycling and potential cost savings.
Swart has already implemented several of Groundwork's recommendations. For
example, it advised the company to reduce its energy consumption by altering
the factory's lighting. The factory had previously had to have all its
lights on when only half were needed. Swart expects future electricity bills
for lighting to be 50 per cent less and will recoup his investment within
eight months.
Groundwork also advised the company to take pallets and bags it receives
from suppliers and re-use them when sending products to its customers. This
it has done with impressive results. In the past, most transport packaging
costs were passed on to customers. By re-using packaging the costs have been
significantly reduced. Customers have been informed about this reduction in
charges.
At Conservation Papers, staff had been running the company along
environmental lines to the best of their abilities. However, in 1992 they
adopted a more formal approach and joined an Environmental Business
Challenge, launched by Reading Borough Council, to help companies develop
and implement an environmental policy. 'It gave us a structure to work
with,' says Bird, 'and most of the changes we've made have been as a result
of it.' In an attempt to reduce its energy consumption by up to 15 per cent,
Conservation Papers has taken some simple steps, turning down thermostats
and switching off heating at weekends.
'At Dragon International, Mackenzie and her colleagues assessed the
environmental impact of all they did from the first day. Setting the company
up, they purchased second-hand 'recycled' furniture - furniture which does
not contain tropical hardwoods, bought a photocopier for double-sided copies
and decided against supplying company cars. Staff are encouraged to use
bicycles or public transport.
The company buys recycled non-chlorine bleached paper, re-uses scrap paper,
re-cycles its paper and laser printer toner cartridges, fits long-life light
bulbs, uses environmentally sensitive cleaning equipment and supplies china
rather than disposable cups.
Being environmentally sensitive brings costs with it. Berger Aus Berg has
spent Pounds 600 on an electrician's bill and Pounds 150 on Groundwork's
fees. Conservation Papers spent Pounds 70 on automatic door closures. Dragon
International's main expenditure will be on better insulation and a more
efficient boiler for its offices costing several hundred pounds.
Although all the companies have spent several hours discussing environmental
practices with staff, none has found the process disruptive. 'Everyone
starts thinking along the same lines,' explains Mackenzie. Swart has seen
his employees change their attitudes. 'At first they were curious about the
review,' he says. 'Now they tell me what we can do to make further
environmental improvements.'
There are other benefits too. All the companies have reduced their overheads
by implementing energy saving measures and all expect to recoup the
investment within two years in lower energy bills.
Perhaps what is surprising is how many benefits have been gained through
relatively few changes. To a large extent these companies have simply made
sure their housekeeping is in good order - albeit under an environmental
umbrella.
Although none has gone out of its way to promote the changes, all the
companies expect that one day they will have to justify their environmental
practices. To that end they are continuing their environmental programmes.
EASY STEPS TO IMPROVING A COMPANY'S ENVIRONMENTAL PRACTICES
Review energy efficiency. Reduce consumption by turning down the thermostats
and turn off un-needed lights and equipment.
Encourage employees to re-use as much equipment as possible - paper-clips,
scrap paper, elastic bands, bull-dog clips etc.
See whether there are ways to reduce waste or generate a further income by
selling your waste as scrap.
Reduce vehicle use. Encourage staff to use public transport or walk. If
employees live locally, set up a company bike scheme.
Review purchasing policy. For example could you save money or improve your
public image by consider purchasing recycled paper. Only buy ozone-friendly
products and cleaning materials which are free of phosphates and are readily
biodegradable.
Reduce paper usage. Encourage staff to write on both sides of any paper and
use double-sided photocopies when sending long memos.
Recycle paper, glass, plastics and cans.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Tebbit warns City over Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIGGEST danger to the City is not Britain refusing to ratify Maastricht,
but Britain ratifying the treaty and losing business to other financial
centres, Lord Tebbit, the arch Euro-sceptic and former Tory chairman, argued
yesterday.
He attacked as a 'silly myth' the claim that Maastricht would lead to the
City losing business to Frankfurt. 'The danger is that we may ratify and
lose our business to New York, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Singapore and before long
Shanghai,' he said.
'Did anyone predict the loss of business to France had their referendum vote
been 51 per cent to 49 per cent instead of 49 per cent to 51 per cent
against the treaty?' he asked.
If Britain rejected the treaty, 'then our position within the European
Community will remain precisely the same as it is today - under the Treaty
of Rome as amended by the Single European Act, warts and all,' Lord Tebbit
said.
He said angrily: 'I am not impressed by the pro-Maastricht arguments of
those pillars of the City establishment whose banks have lost billions of
shareholders' money by bad business decisions when they write to The Times
to say that I do not know my business as a politician.
To them I say as a shareholder, 'a period of reticence might be welcomed'.'

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Labour sidesteps union showdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR HAS shelved a plan to look at the unions' powerful position on the
party's ruling National Executive Committee, side-stepping a further
confrontation with the unions over their links with the party.
The working group reviewing the party's relationship with the unions has
decided against pursuing the issue.
Last month's NEC meeting, however, endorsed the first part of the group's
work, a consultation paper for party members on the role of the unions.
Mr John Smith, the party leader, ran into fierce protests from leaders of
some of the largest unions when he told that meeting that he wanted the
unions excluded from the selection of parliamentary candidates and the
election of the Labour leadership, and expressed support for further
reductions in the union vote at conference.
It had been intended that when July's NEC meeting agreed recommendations to
be put to the party conference in October, it would also consider the review
group's conclusions about union representation on the NEC itself. There are
currently 12 union places among the 25 elected places on the NEC - compared
with 7 members elected by constituency parties, the next-largest group.
Members of the union review group said that the plan had been abandoned for
the time being partly because of the other changes to the party machinery,
and partly because it had not been in the original terms of reference.
The new National Policy Forum, which will include councillors and MPs, was
approved by the conference last year, and in the autumn the composition of
the NEC will be affected by the commitment to raise the number of women
members.
'It raised too many questions to be dealt with as an 'add-on',' one group
member said yesterday.
Although there is little doubt that Mr Smith's preferences for the scaling
down of union links will prevail, Labour could face severe embarrassment
during the union conference season as some unions continue to voice
opposition to the plans and question the future of the political levy which
finances the party's activities.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Generators seal supply contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COAL and electricity industries yesterday completed deals under which
generating companies will buy 160m tonnes of coal over five years and sell
the electricity it produces for about Pounds 13bn to regional power
companies.
The deals, notified to the Stock Exchange yesterday after nearly a year of
intense negotiations, involve the sale of about 430 terrawatt hours of
electricity from the generators to the regional companies.
They are based on an average price of 3.26 pence per kilowatt hour in the
first year starting on Thursday, a 12 per cent reduction on this year,
falling to 3.1p pence in the final year.
National Power, the larger of the two generators, said after the first year
there would be a 1 per cent cut in real terms in each of the following four
years in the cost of electricity to regional companies.
PowerGen said price reductions to the regional companies would amount to 17
per cent over the five years. Both generators said the full benefits of
lower coal prices were being passed on. But this is disputed by the regional
companies who say the generators are keeping some of the benefits.
The price in the first year is Pounds 1.51 per gigajoule, compared to Pounds
1.86 this year, and will fall to Pounds 1.33 in the final year. British Coal
will earn Pounds 5.5bn through the contracts.
National Power is buying 24m tonnes of coal in the first year and 18m in the
four subsequent years. The agreements cover about 70 per cent of National
Power's expected output in the first year, declining to about 50 per cent in
later years. PowerGen, the other generator, is buying 16m tonnes initially
and 12m in subsequent years.
The generators are also committed to buying coal from private producers over
the next five years, although contracts have still to be finalised.
Yesterday's contracts underpin price decreases by regional power companies
of up to 3.5 per cent from April 1.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME 200,000 changes to draft valuations for the council tax are expected to
have been made even before the starting date for appeals, Mr Anthony Nelson,
the Treasury economic secretary, said yesterday.
He said that the changes resulted from local councils notifying the listing
officers of alterations and from public inquiries. The formal date for
appealing against a valuation, which will affect how much local tax a
household will pay, is 1 April when the new tax comes into effect. Ministers
have made provision for about 1m appeals.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE head of the government's Benefits Agency should be sacked because of the
'shambles' over which he presides, Mr Gerald Kaufman, the senior Labour MP
demanded yesterday.
The former shadow foreign secretary told the Commons that one of his
Manchester Gorton constituents had her benefit application delayed 'because
of one mistake discovered after three months and another mistake discovered
after 11 months'.
'The agency is a shambles,' he protested, adding: 'This service should be
made properly answerable to the House of Commons.'
Replying, Mr Robert Jackson, junior civil service minister, referred to
delays in processing applications for the new disability living allowance,
and insisted: 'A strong effort is being made to put things right in the
agency and real progress is being made.'

launched
</HEADLINE>

A POUNDS 40m SCHEME to provide week-long workshops for those out of work for
12 months or more was launched by the government yesterday. Jobplan
workshops, announced in the Autumn Statement, will be mandatory  - people
refusing a place or failing to complete the training could lose some
benefit.
Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment secretary, said she was keen to do more
to help and motivate the 1m people who have been out of work for more than a
year.
'Attending a Jobplan workshop will give them a better chance to compete more
successfully for the opportunities that are available,' she said.
'It is not unusual for people who have been out of work for over a year to
be unclear about their job goals and the options open to them,' she said.
'Jobplan will give them the maximum help to overcome their difficulties and
get back to work as quickly as possible.'

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: The one-man English Development
Agency - The rising influence of Lord Walker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUGH retired from politics, Lord Walker, the former cabinet minister
appointed to co-ordinate measures to help the communities affected by pit
closures, wields more influence than some still in government.
His remit has expanded almost imperceptibly to include advising Mr Michael
Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, on the broader implications for
regional policy and for inward investment measures. Before the election, he
was appointed chairman-designate of the urban regeneration agency, also by
Mr Heseltine, who was his junior minister at environment in the early 1970s.
The two share a conviction that government should work in partnership with
industry. Some Whitehall officials believe that in Lord Walker, Mr Heseltine
has realised an ambition thwarted by some of his colleagues and found a
one-man English Development Agency in all but name.
But so far, Lord Walker's mission has been somewhat hanging fire. The URA
will not begin its work until the autumn, and the coalfields project has
been held up while the government reviewed its endorsement of British Coal's
decision to close 31 pits. The white paper should, however, mark a watershed
in terms of making progress.
Lord Walker said yesterday that while the delays had been 'frustrating', the
time had been usefully spent in meetings which brought home to officials the
need to ensure that their activities dovetailed. Measures were now ready to
be activated 'immediately' a decision had been reached on a particular pit.
Though the great affection he expresses for the coal industry is not
universally reciprocated by those who remember him as energy secretary at
the time of the bitter 1984-85 miners' strike, some of the areas which feel
most at risk have invited him to visit, and he has been to Durham, Yorkshire
and Nottinghamshire.
'You have to have a team,' he says of the need to get local councils,
industry, training and enterprise councils, and government working together.
One of his biggest fans at Westminster says, however, that it is his
'bullying manner', which makes him ideal for the job.
While Labour admits he has abilities as a 'super-salesman', opposition MPs
are more doubtful about what they see as his belief that simply by insisting
a venture is a success it can be turned into one. A few express more serious
reservations as well: last week some Labour MPs tabled Commons motions
accusing him of misleading MPs about discussions on private sector
involvement in the Welsh Development Agency.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: MoD revives Pounds 170m helicopter
carrier plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday threw a lifeline to Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipyard, by reviving plans for a specialised naval helicopter carrier,
expected to cost about Pounds 170m.
The carrier emerged as a prime candidate for cancellation earlier this year
in order to help the Ministry of Defence meet the budget cuts imposed in
last November's public expenditure settlement.
After intensive lobbying by naval chiefs and by Swan Hunter, Mr Jonathan
Aitken, defence procurement minister, said yesterday in a written
parliamentary answer that the MoD was keeping the carrier in its programme
and expected to place an order later this year.
However, he said tenderers had been asked to 'clarify' their bids. He also
warned that the ministry would apply 'normal technical and value-for-money
criteria' in deciding the contract award.
Swan Hunter, which has no naval shipbuilding work on its books beyond next
year, is relying heavily on the order to maintain its 2,200 jobs. But it
will have to compete against the VSEL yard at Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria,
which envisages buying the hull from the Norwegian-owned Kvaerner Govan
commercial shipyard on Clydeside. Both bids were submitted last October.
Mr Alex Marsh, joint group chief executive of Swan Hunter, the Tyneside
shipbuilder, said it was excellent news, both for the Royal Navy and Swan
Hunter.
Swan Hunter now faces a bitter fight for the order, worth around Pounds
170m, from VSEL, which has linked with Govan on the Clyde to tender for the
landing platform helicopter.
'Quite clearly we intend to win this competition,' said Mr Marsh. 'We'll win
it by taking advantage of our excellent track record in building ships of
this type.'
Mr Marsh has described the order as 'absolutely critical' for Swan Hunter,
which has a blank order book after 1994. The company, which employs 2,200,
has spent Pounds 1.5m on its bid.
The decision means that the MoD will have to make cuts elsewhere in its
equipment programme.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Official defends Girobank sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Peter Gregson, permanent secretary to the Department of Trade and
Industry, told the Commons public accounts committee yesterday that 'no
corners were cut' when the state-owned Girobank was privatised in 1989.
He said no complaints had been received from the Co-operative Wholesale
Society about the way its Pounds 124m bid was overtaken when the Alliance
and Leicester building society increased its original offer and acquired
Girobank for Pounds 130m.
Sir Peter was questioned about the role of Schroders, advisers to the Post
Office on the privatisation, in informing the two bidders that they were in
a 'competitive situation'.
He was asked if the Alliance and Leicester had been told that its original
bid of Pounds 120m had been 'topped'.
Sir Peter answered: 'To the best of my knowledge it was not.'
Mr Robert Sheldon, committee chairman, said it would be a 'very serious
matter' if it were found that one bidder had been privy to circumstances
which had not produced the best result for the taxpayer.
Responding to questions from Mr Terry Davis (Lab Birmingham Hodge Hill) Sir
Peter said he had been told by Schroders what took place in telephone calls
made to both the Co-operative Wholesale Society and Alliance and Leicester.
Mr Davis asked: 'Did you say this is a bit suspicious?'
Sir Peter answered: 'I do not see why you should be suspicious.' He
highlighted the National Audit Office report which stated that Schroders did
not explicitly invite revised bids, but sought to establish whether final
offers had been made by the Co-operative Wholesale Society and Alliance and
Leicester.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Bottomley advances health strategy
paper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Virginia Bottomley, the health secretary, (above) was keynote speaker at
a conference yesterday advancing a paper by her department outlining its
Health of the Nation strategy.
Meanwhile the Labour party is claiming today that a majority of
self-governing trust hospitals ban the public and press from board meetings.
A survey carried out by Labour on accountability in NHS hospital trusts
showed that among 'first wave' trusts, 50 per cent had not held board
meetings, apart from the statutory annual general meeting, which the public
and press could attend. Among 'second wave' trusts the figure was 59.3 per
cent.
Mr David Blunkett, the shadow health secretary, claimed trust boards were
being packed with Tory nominees. He said the statutory requirement to hold
one public meeting per year to discuss the annual report and accounts should
be reviewed.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Council tendering rules to be
altered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPULSORY competitive tendering of county council and district council
services will be suspended immediately before reorganisations arising from
recommendations of the Local Government Commission, Mr Robin Squire,
environment minister, said yesterday.
He said the requirement to put services out to tender would be suspended for
local authorities after parliament approved legislation to merge or
reorganise them. New authorities would be required to start tendering as
soon as possible after their setting-up, with new contracts operative no
more than 18 months later.
However, the government also announced that tendering will be extended to
local authority construction-related and corporate services from 1995-96.
It also announced new regulations to stop anti-competitive behaviour by
local authorities which helps the in-house workforce to win contracts. These
include stricter rules to separate the responsibilities of those putting out
work to tender from the council workforce.
The timetable is also to be altered for contracts worth more than Pounds
100,000 or lasting more than one year to provide extra time for contractors
to draw up bids. The new rules come into force on 10 May.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Cook accuses Heseltine of
misleading Tories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NONE OF the 12 pits saved by the coal white paper will be open in a year, Mr
Robin Cook, the shadow trade and industry secretary, said yesterday,
accusing Mr Michael Heseltine of trying to mislead wavering Conservative
backbenchers.
In last night's debate, in which the government secured a majority of 22, Mr
Cook said the trade and industry secretary had selected a number of pits for
reprieve purely to get rebel backbenchers 'in the same lobby as himself'
without securing markets for 'one extra bag of coal'.
He added that what the government was doing was ' . . digging a pit for them
to fall into because one year from now, not one of these pits will be open'.
He said the 'biggest failure' of the white paper was that it had not
accepted any of the trade and industry select committee's recommendations
for ending the 'rigged' electricity market.
He challenged Mr Heseltine to explain where the market for the 13m tonnes
the 12 pits would produce this year would come from, arguing that the coal
imports which this production might displace had only been forecast at 9m
tonnes and contracts for 2m tonnes of this had already been signed.
Faced by Conservative demands to say whether he backed strikes threatened by
miners, Mr Cook said the Union of Democratic Mineworkers' ballot on possible
action highlighted the extent of the government 'betrayal'.
In his opening speech Mr Heseltine said no pit would be closed without the
private sector having an opportunity to bid for it and set out fresh details
of the circumstances under which subsidies might be offered to private mine
operators.
He said he would be prepared to offer a subsidy to private-sector
organisations which could demonstrate they had found a 'genuinely'
additional market for coal. This would exclude offers to supply coal under
the core five-year contracts signed yesterday.
He rejected suggestions that the tapering subsidies announced last week
would be for two years only. The trade and industry secretary indicated they
would last until the industry was privatised.
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock, who voted against the government, said she could not
support the government motion because it did not address 'the problem of
equality in the market'.
She said coal needed 'a fair crack at an equal-opportunity market'.
Privatisation ought to get rid of layers of British Coal bureaucracy such as
its regional offices 'and hopefully the chairman as well'.
Mr Richard Alexander, Conservative MP for Newark, who also voted against the
government, said that the government had not done all it 'could or should
have done to provide a wider market for coal'. Coal privatisation should
have taken place before electricity privatisation, he said.
Mr Winston Churchill, who abstained on the motion, had earlier said he would
not support the government unless it indicated that it was prepared to
impose tighter restrictions on output from gas-powered electricity
generators.
He said the deal giving Electricite de France 'privileged' access to the UK
electricity market was 'a scandal of enormous proportions'.
Mr Richard Caborn, Labour chairman of the trade and industry committee,
protested that the core recommendations of his committee had been rejected
by Mr Heseltine, 'without exception'.
Winding up, Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said the government was
optimistic of obtaining EC approval for its subsidy plans.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Parliament and Politics: Generators finalise supply
contracts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COAL and electricity industries yesterday completed deals under which
generating companies will buy 160m tonnes of coal over five years and sell
the electricity it produces for about Pounds 13bn to regional power
companies.
The deals, notified to the Stock Exchange yesterday after nearly a year of
intense negotiations, involve the sale of about 430 terrawatt hours of
electricity from the generators to the regional companies.
They are based on an average price of 3.26 pence per kilowatt hour in the
first year starting on Thursday, a 12 per cent reduction on this year,
falling to 3.1p pence in the final year.
National Power, the larger of the two generators, said after the first year
there would be a 1 per cent cut in real terms in each of the following four
years in the cost of electricity to regional companies.
PowerGen said price reductions to the regional companies would amount to 17
per cent over the five years. Both generating companies said the full
benefits of lower coal prices were being passed on. But this is disputed by
the regional companies who say the generators are keeping some of the
benefits.
The price in the first year is Pounds 1.51 per gigajoule, compared to Pounds
1.86 this year, and will fall to Pounds 1.33 in the final year. British Coal
will earn Pounds 5.5bn through the contracts.
National Power is buying 24m tonnes of coal in the first year and 18m in the
four subsequent years. The agreements cover about 70 per cent of National
Power's expected output in the first year, declining to about 50 per cent in
later years. PowerGen, the other generator, is buying 16m tonnes initially
and 12m in subsequent years.
The generators are also committed to buying coal from private producers over
the next five years, although contracts have still to be finalised.
Yesterday's contracts underpin price decreases by regional power companies
of up to 3.5 per cent from April 1. Some companies have indicated they will
reconsider less significant decreases or freezes following publication of
the coal white paper and the deals concluded yesterday. British Coal and the
generators will be free to discuss contracts for additional tonnages which
will provide a future for some of the 12 pits reprieved last week.

FT  30 MAR 93 / InterCity bids for Pounds 150m to lease trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL'S InterCity business yesterday said it hoped to take advantage
of the government's new rolling-stock leasing arrangements by bidding for
Pounds 150m of funds to finance a fleet of replacement trains for the London
Euston to Manchester line.
It also said it expected to report a small profit in the financial year just
ending and announced a marketing venture with Shell UK offering motorists
free train tickets in exchange for petrol vouchers.
The leasing deal would take advantage of the government's decision last
autumn to make Pounds 150m available to BR in an attempt to establish a
leasing market for rolling stock in the run-up to railway privatisation.
If it succeeds, InterCity will order about 15 more of the InterCity 225
trains built by GEC Alsthom, the Anglo-French engineering company. It has
already supplied trains for services running to and from London King's
Cross.
The 15 trains would replace those operating between London and Manchester,
and the displaced trains would in turn replace the outdated trains running
between London and the west Midlands.
However, InterCity's bid is subject to competition from Network SouthEast,
which wants to use the Pounds 150m to lease a fleet of 40 modified Networker
trains built by ABB Transportation (formerly Brel). These would replace
outdated rolling stock on Kent coast routes.
Mr Roger Freeman, minister for public transport, is expected to announce a
decision on the competing bids after Easter.
The joint promotion with Shell is the most unusual element of a spring
marketing campaign unveiled by Mr Chris Green, InterCity's managing
director.
Shell said it expected most tickets handed out to be for journeys that would
not otherwise have been undertaken, or at least not by road.
Other features of the InterCity marketing campaign, which is aimed at
countering the effects of the recession, include:
Afternoon tea and weekend restaurant car services will be restored on
selected services in response to passenger demand.
The InterCity shuttle will offer high-frequency services from London to the
west Midlands, east Midlands and East Anglia.
Tickets which are the cheapest in real terms since 1948 will be available
through the extension of Apex fares to all InterCity journeys of more than
150 miles.

<TEXT>
LONDON FORUM, the private-sector body set up to promote London as a business
location and tourist centre, is to create two organisations to attract
inward investment and expand tourism, Sir Allen Sheppard, Forum chairman and
chairman of Grand Metropolitan, announced yesterday.
London Inward will encourage business investment with emphasis on persuading
international businesses to locate their headquarters in the capital. Led by
Sir Colin Marshall, British Airways chairman, it plans to take over the
First Stop Shop created by the City Corporation, Westminster City Council
and London Docklands Development Corporation to provide information for
inward investors. London Visitors will try to raise income from tourism by
developing existing markets and targeting new markets in Japan, the European
Community and the US.
It hopes to merge with the London Tourist Board.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said London needed to fight harder
in world markets to maintain and raise its share of future opportunities. He
added: 'We must all make the most of every opportunity to tell the world
what London has to offer.' The deputy chairmen of the London Forum board
are: Sir Hugh Bidwell, chairman London Tourist Board; Sir Colin Marshall,
chairman British Airways; Sir Brian Wolfson, chairman Wembley.
The other members of the London Forum board are: Sir Christopher Bland,
chairman LWT; Mr Rocco Forte, chairman Forte; Mr Nigel Fox Bassett, senior
partner Clifford Chance; Mr Harvey Goldsmith, director Allied
Entertainments; Mr David Goldstone, chairman Regalian Properties; Ms Jan
Hall, chief executive of Coley Porter Bell; Mr Anthony Hilton, managing
director, Evening Standard; Sir Brian Jenkins, senior partner, Coopers &amp;
Lybrand and former Lord Mayor of London; Mr Keith Oates, managing director,
Marks &amp; Spencer; Mr Brian Pearce, chairman Pearce Signs; Sir Idris Pearce,
consultant Richard Ellis; Mr Ian Reeves, chairman Highpoint; Mr Maurice
Saatchi, chairman Saatchi &amp; Saatchi; Sir David Scholey, chairman SG Warburg;
Mr Clyde Williams, chief executive WWA.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Alleged insider denies receiving profit warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN investment analyst accused of insider dealing yesterday told the Court of
Session in Edinburgh that when Mr Peter Runciman, chairman of the waste
disposal company Shanks &amp; McEwan, gave him a briefing he failed to say the
company planned to issue a profits warning.
Mr Thorold Mackie, an investment analyst with Bell Lawrie White, the
Edinburgh stockbrokers, said Mr Runciman did not tell him that everything
discussed at their meeting was confidential.
Mr Mackie has pleaded not guilty to a charge of insider dealing under the
1985 Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act. Mr Runciman said in
evidence last week that on September 6 1991 he told Mr Mackie that Shanks &amp;
McEwan was to issue a profits warning because its earnings per share for the
half-year were likely to fall slightly instead of growing as indicated
previously. He also said he told Mr Mackie that everything said at the
meeting was confidential.
The prosecution alleges that Mr Mackie 'counselled and procured' two
salesmen at Bell Lawrie to deal in the shares of Shanks &amp; McEwan. They sold
1.9m of their clients' shares, realising Pounds 1.39m more than if they had
sold the shares after the profits warning was issued.
Mr Mackie told the jury that at the meeting, which had been arranged about a
month earlier, Mr Runciman told him 'there would be little by way of growth
in earnings per share' for Shanks &amp; McEwan that half-year. Mr Runciman gave
him other information for a circular, and told him that four particular
items of detailed information were confidential.
Asked by Mr Donald Macfadyen, QC, defending, whether Mr Runciman had
indicated that any other information was confidential, Mr Mackie replied:
'He did not.'
Mr Mackie said Mr Runciman had not used the phrase 'profits warning', nor
had he said anything to indicate that the company was planning to issue a
profits warning. Mr Runciman had said nothing that conveyed the idea of
issuing a profits warning, Mr Mackie said.
After the meeting Mr Mackie had a meeting at Bell Lawrie with salesmen Mr
Allan Gilmour Thom and Mr Colin McLeod Telfer. He gave a resume of Mr
Runciman's briefing, telling them there would be 'little by way of growth in
earnings per share or no growth in earnings per share, which is the same
thing'.
The three concluded that clients should be advised to 'take the top off
their holdings in SME', Mr Mackie said.
The shares were sold the following Monday, September 9. On September 11 Mr
Runciman telephoned Mr Mackie and said: 'Thorold, you have broken your
confidence. I gave you privileged information.'
Mr Mackie told the court: 'I then said: 'You gave me certain things in
confidence and I haven't passed those on'.'
Mr Mackie said that if Mr Runciman had told him about the profits warning,
'I would have considered myself an insider. I would have gone back to the
office and said nothing. For an analyst to have been made an insider and
then ignored it would have been suicidal.' The jury will hear closing
speeches today.

THE Chemical Industries Association yesterday offered an annual pay rise of
about 1.4 per cent to most of the 25,000 process and craft workers covered
by its agreement. Lower-paid workers were offered about 1.7 per cent. The
offer was rejected by the union side but officials said they would report it
to their members. The unions had asked for a substantial pay rise, an
increase in holiday pay, and for working parties on temporary workers and
contractors. The employers agreed to a working party on temporary workers
but rejected the idea for contractors.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Power company staff get 2.9% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MIDLAND ELECTRICITY, one of the 12 regional electricity companies, has
agreed a pay increase of 2.9 per cent with its 5,500 staff. The company has
also won agreement to more flexible working time and changed working
practices, David Goodhart writes.
Mr Richard Young, Midlands Electricity managing director, described the
agreement as 'historic'. Many other regional companies are similarly engaged
in detailed renegotiation of working patterns.
The pay rise is less generous than the rises recently agreed at the
generator PowerGen and National Grid, which runs the network in England and
Wales. At PowerGen most of the 5,500 workers will receive rises this year,
including one-off bonuses, of between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. National
Grid has been even more generous with rises of between 5 per cent and 10 per
cent for most of its 5,500 employees.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Union derecognition exceeds predictions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DERECOGNITION of trade unions over the past five years has been far greater
than most commentators assume, but has affected less than 100,000 employees,
says a paper to be presented to tomorrow's annual Labour Process Conference.
The paper says that between August 1988 and March 1993 there have been 304
cases of derecognition, an average annual rate of about 70. The sectors most
affected have been newspapers and publishing, ports and shipping, banking
and insurance, transport and distribution, chemicals and oil, the health
service and the water industry.
The paper, by Mr Gregor Gall of the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology, and Dr Sonia McKay of the Labour Research
Department, also finds that the spread of derecognition has changed.
'It is no longer a predominantly middle-level managerial or white-collar or
non-manufacturing industry phenomenon or one that arises only out of a fall
in union membership,' says the paper.
The paper says that the three most common reasons for derecognition are low
levels of union membership; a move to a single-union agreement and
privatisation.
The researchers conclude that most employers are not seriously considering a
'full-frontal' derecognition offensive but rather pushing through radical
changes within a collective bargaining context.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Concern at future cost of water bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFWAT, the water industry regulator, yesterday said that more than half of
the respondents to a consultation paper it published last August, were
'seriously concerned' about the affordability of future water bills if
required improvements are implemented, Bronwen Maddox writes.
Nearly a third of the 112 responses to Ofwat's August 1992 consultation
paper felt more scientific evidence of health benefits was needed to justify
improvements. Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat's director-general, who has warned that
bills could double by 2005 on top of the rate of inflation, said of the
required improvements: 'Everything is going at a fantastic pace in the water
industry and that is reflected in (the rise in) bills.'
The 10 Ofwat regional customer service committees also announced yesterday
they would form a joint national council to make customers' concerns better
heard in Whitehall and Brussels.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Women's pay expected to suffer if wage councils go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABOLITION of wages councils will increase the gap between men's and
women's rates of pay throughout the economy, a study by the Pay Equity
Project, a pressure group, warns.
Wages councils are due to be scrapped under the bill on union reform and
employment rights going through parliament. The bill will come in for a
third day of scrutiny in committee today in the House of Lords.
The group's analysis of official government data found that last year women
manual workers in wages council industries earned 81.3 per cent of
comparative male wages. This compared with 71.5 per cent across all
industries.
The lowest 10 per cent of women non-manual workers covered by wages councils
earned 90.5 per cent of equivalent male rates, compared with an all-industry
figure of 79.2 per cent. All the figures are for average hourly earnings.
Overall, the gender gap on pay has been narrower in wages council industries
than the average across all industries for each year since 1979, found the
Pay Equity Project.
The group claims that the scrapping of wages councils will lead to wider
differentials between wages of men and women in those industries, which
'will, in turn, create a knock-on effect on the earnings ratio for all
industries'.
The councils set wages floors for 2.5m low-paid private-sector workers in
industries such as catering and hairdressing where most workers are women.
The group acknowledges it could be argued that the male-female pay gap is
narrower in wages council industries because male wages are also depressed
due to the high numbers of women workers. However, the Pay Equity Project
has also compared similar female-dominated industries and still identified
larger gaps between male and female earnings in those that are not covered
by the councils.
The Trades Union Congress, backed by the Equal Opportunities Commission, is
lodging an official complaint with the European Commission over the planned
abolition of wages councils.
It is claimed that the government is infringing its commitment to EC equal
pay legislation for women. The government argues that wages councils are
arbitrary and outdated and prevent the creation of jobs.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Companies House sell-off plan studied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is expected soon to move further towards privatisation of
Companies House, the government's corporate information agency.
The management consultancy SRU, which was hired by the government last
autumn, has submitted a report on the agency's future to the Department of
Trade and Industry. The report spells out a range of options for the agency,
with emphasis given to privatisation. Other possibilities include further
contracting-out of services.
The department is expected to make a statement which will call for
consultants to examine further the options for Companies House, and to
consider the practical difficulties of privatisation.
Problems to be considered include how many agencies would be permitted to
collect company information and how information would be stored.
Some company agents in the private sector fear that Companies House might
exploit a monopoly position over access to corporate data.
It is believed that a wide-ranging bill would need to be approved by
parliament to permit privatisation of the agency. The bill would need to
spell out the responsibilities of any company that took over the agency's
functions.
Consultants are also likely to be asked to consider options for lessening
the requirements for filing information with Companies House.
These could include removing the requirement for filing annual returns, or
for listing other directorships held by each member of a company's board.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Forum chief unruffled by critics' sniping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Allen Sheppard, the outspoken chairman and chief executive of Grand
Metropolitan, is unconcerned at sniping over the two private-sector
organisations he chairs to promote the interests of London.
One, London First, aims to harness business leadership and management skills
in strategic thinking about the capital's future. The other, London Forum,
yesterday revealed plans to promote London as a business and tourist centre.
But some opposition politicians are concerned that the government sees the
bodies as a substitute for an elected authority for London.
There has also been criticism from bodies such as the Corporation of London,
the local authority for the City, which feel that such newcomers are
muscling in on their work.
'It shows that we're getting somewhere,' says Sir Allen. 'I would have
expected downright hostility. If it's just scepticism we face, we're making
progress.'
He adds: 'What we have to convince people of is that we can bring extra
support from the business community for what is already going on.'
Sir Allen is unruffled by accusations that he is not accountable. He points
out that the reputation of GrandMet is linked to his performance as chairman
of the two bodies. 'If we get things wrong, it will be very bad news for
GrandMet.
'Consumer capitalism means that our customers now look through our brands at
what the company stands for. I am answerable to them through the Pounds 1m
they vote for our products every hour of the day.'
He also believes that business executives can help in the switch from what
he calls 'they-ism' to 'we-ism'.
Sir Allen says: 'We used to spend much of the time saying that 'they' ought
to tackle certain issues. We never found out who 'they' were. During the
1980s, 'we' began to emerge - companies, consumers, pressure groups etc.
Business is part of that and can make an input into solving problems.'
The two organisations hope to contribute to the debate over London's
infrastructure, which is widely agreed to be central to the capital's
international competitiveness.
One of the first challenges to the clout of the bodies will be CrossRail,
the proposed east-to-west rail link. The government has asked for the scheme
to be re-examined to see if private finance can be introduced.
'We can't take sides over the merits of one bit of infrastructure over
another,' says Sir Allen. 'But we must make sure that the government knows
the business community sees CrossRail as a priority. And we can get together
some of the best brains in the City to see how the financing can be made to
work.'
Mr Stephen O'Brien, chief executive of both organisations, is happy to be
judged by results. He says: 'If after five years things have happened which
otherwise would not have happened, I would regard that as a success.'

FT  30 MAR 93 / VAG to reduce staff further
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
VAG (United Kingdom), the importer/distributor of Volkswagen and Audi
vehicles, has introduced a voluntary redundancy and early retirement
programme in order to make further reductions in the company's workforce of
780.
The company has already cut its workforce by 38 per cent in the past three
years from 1,250 in 1989.
VAG, taken over by Volkswagen of Germany from Lonrho for Pounds 124m late
last year, refused to specify any target for future job cuts. It said,
however, that cost reduction programmes, including the possible contracting
out of some operations, would continue for the next two to three years.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Rover joint venture aims to revive MG
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER, the motor vehicle subsidiary of British Aerospace, is in advanced
negotiations to form a co-operative venture for the production of a new
range of MG sports cars.
It hopes to resurrect one of the world's best-known sports-car marques with
the help of external finance, more than a decade after MG was killed off.
Rover is negotiating with Mayflower, the specialist UK engineering company,
to form a collaborative production venture for the new MG range.
Code-named PR3, the sports car would be a small, affordable mid-engined
roadster that could be ready for launch by 1995-96.
The company cleared the way in the autumn last for a revival of the MG
marque when it unveiled its low-volume MG RV8, a redesigned and more
powerful variant of the MGB sports car last produced in 1980.
The PR3 is designed to return MG to mainstream sports carmaking, a market
dominated in recent years by Japanese carmakers with products such as the
Mazda MX-5, following the earlier demise of UK sportscar makes such as
Triumph and MG.
Rover, formerly the loss-making state-owned British Leyland, abandoned this
market in 1980 with the closure of the MG plant at Abingdon, Oxfordshire.
Under the terms of the proposed collaboration with Mayflower, Motor Panels,
the Coventry-based supplier of automotive bodies and a subsidiary of
Mayflower since 1991, would produce the MG body panels and supply the welded
bodies to Rover for painting and final assembly.
Mayflower, due to announce today its preliminary financial results for 1992,
is also expected to launch a new share issue aimed in part at financing the
planned venture with Rover.
A revival of the distinctive MG marque has long been planned by Rover, but
the UK carmaker has lacked the funds to finance the venture alone in the
face of the heavy capital demands of its mainstream new model programmes.
In less than four years Rover has renewed most of its product range starting
with the launch of the 200/400 series, the Land Rover Discovery and a
re-engineered Metro in 1989 and 1990, followed by a revamped Rover 800 in
1991 and the imminent launch of the Rover 600 next month.
The attraction of the venture for Rover is that Mayflower would take over
responsibility for financing a costly part of the new MG development
programme, namely the development of the tooling and equipment for producing
the body panels and for welding the bodies. Mayflower already produces the
exterior panels for the Land Rover Discovery and cabs for the Leyland Daf 45
series light trucks.
The Pounds 26,500 MG RV8 was developed to mark the 30th anniversary of the
MGB, of which more than 500,000 were built.
The RV8 will be produced at a maximum volume of only 15 a week with first
delivery starting next month, but the model is intended to resurrect the MG
name in public awareness.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Secretaries are 'undervalued'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE JOBS of secretaries and their bosses could become indistinguishable,
except in two important respects - pay and training, says the Industrial
Society.
A survey to be published by the society next month shows that secretaries in
Britain are increasingly taking on supervision of other staff and carrying
out research work. At the same time, bosses are increasingly doing their own
typing and making coffee.
The society said it was concerned that some organisations were 'playing a
confidence trick' on secretaries by not providing them with training for
their new responsibilities. Some companies were guilty of double standards
by providing training only for managers.
It said it was 'a logical next step, if companies expect more and more
management tasks to be performed by secretaries, that they must accept that
those secretaries are currently undervalued in pay terms'.
More than half of the nearly 400 managers surveyed claimed that their
companies were prepared to promote secretaries to managerial positions.
The managers were asked which jobs they thought would take more of
secretaries' time in future. The results included: setting up new systems
(52 per cent of those surveyed); own project work (45 per cent); research
(39 per cent); organising conferences, exhibitions and annual general
meetings (26 per cent); dealing with personnel matters (25 per cent).
The findings reinforce an Industrial Society survey carried out last month
which revealed that up to one third of a manager's working week is spent on
paperwork and that a declining number of bosses now have personal
secretaries.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Pounds 150m plan for opera house at risk
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE AMBITIOUS Pounds 150m development plan for the Royal Opera House site in
London's Covent Garden could face a setback tonight when a Westminster City
Council committee is expected to seek assurances that sufficient money will
be available to complete the whole project.
The council, which gave planning permission for the four-phase plan in 1990,
still accepts the merits of the redevelopment in principle, but is against
piecemeal expansion. It is not convinced the opera house has sufficient
funds to complete the project.
A recommendation before the planning committee proposes acceptance of the
second phase of the development, which is for a seven-storey building to
include shops and a permanent home for the Royal Ballet, but only if certain
assurances are given.
The main assurance is confirmation that funding can be guaranteed for the
complete project. If this is not forthcoming, the committee will demand a
new design for the second phase that will be judged on its own merits rather
than as part of a larger development.
Acceptance of the committee's recommendations could delay the redevelopment
plans substantially as the opera house's management seeks more funding.
The redevelopment total of Pounds 150m is to be composed of Pounds 60m from
commercial development of the site and additional retail opportunities, with
the remaining Pounds 90m coming equally from public and private sources. The
management remains confident that the money will be raised, but it is not
yet clear where it will come from. The government has stated categorically
that no further Treasury money will be made available, and the most likely
source of public money is likely to be the national lottery's millennium
fund when it is launched next year.
Lord Sainsbury, a former chairman of the opera house and a likely private
benefactor, is to see Mr John Major, the prime minister, shortly to advocate
the merits of the development scheme and to seek Pounds 45m from the
millennium fund in three annual tranches.

ESSO is cutting the maximum pump price for petrol by 4.5p a gallon (1p a

on Friday that it would reduce its maximum price by 6p a gallon from
yesterday.
Esso's new maximum prices will be four-star 258.7p a gallon (56.9p a litre),
unleaded 235.9p a gallon (51.9p a litre) and Superplus unleaded 254.1p a
gallon (55.9p a litre).
Shell is cutting 10p a gallon (2.2p a litre) from its wholesale diesel
price. The cut will be applied at more than half of Shell's 2,400 service
stations. The remainder are already selling below the new maximum price.
Shell said it was the first oil company to announce a diesel price cut since
the Budget when 12.2p a gallon was added to to the pump price of diesel.

The number of failures this year is 172, up from 56 in the same period last
year, according to Dun &amp; Bradstreet, the business information group.
Small businesses have borne the the brunt of the failures with 120
bankruptcies. Among larger companies there was an increase in liquidations

Dun &amp; Bradstreet said: 'Even with an expected upturn in trading conditions
in the UK mainland, it does not follow that any pick-up in the Northern
Ireland economy is assured in the short term.'

THE FIRST signs of the next dispute between building societies and the

again that mortgage rates may rise unless the government makes National
Savings products less attractive to investors.
Mr Andrew Longhurst, chief executive of Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, led last

of the National Savings First Option bond. Yesterday Mr Longhurst was going
over some familiar territory again.
He said; 'It would only take one major lender to move rates upwards and
everybody would shift. That would be another competitive pressure on
societies, and we are already squeezed.' However, like other chief
executives, Mr Longhurst thinks the battle is likely to be delayed for a few
months.
The first warning that tensions were about to rise emerged in the Budget
when Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, emphasised the role that National
Savings would have to play in funding the estimated Pounds 50bn public
sector deficit for 1993-94.
This role was not calculated to reassure societies, which are already
struggling to attract funds. Their net inflow of funds last year was only
Pounds 295m, compared to Pounds 5.8bn in 1991. Base interest rate falls have
made their savings products less attractive.
For the moment, the lack of attractiveness does not matter too much because
demand for mortgages is also low. However, any strong upturn in housing
demand could create problems for societies since they will lack the retail
funding from individual savers to satisfy it. The only way of getting such
retail funds would be to raise interest rates.
Mr Longhurst has no doubts that mortgage rates would have to rise to support
any retail savings rises. He said: 'Retail funds form the basis of our
business. They dictate our mortgage rates.' He added that societies would
have to attract new funds if they were to help any housing market revival.
There are two obstacles to getting retail funds. First, the re-emergence of
the First Option bond, now offering 6.34 per cent gross on investments of
more than Pounds 1,000. Second, limits on holdings of other National Savings
products have been raised.  This includes a five-fold rise in the income
bond limit to Pounds 250,000.
National Savings products took in a net Pounds 4.1bn in the 11 months to
February, compared with Pounds 2.6bn for the same period to February last
year. Treasury officials expect National Savings to contribute between
Pounds 4bn and Pounds 4.5bn to finance of the Pounds 50bn deficit in the
coming financial year.
The government has as yet shown few signs of discovering new sources of
deficit funding. It has not responded to calls from banks for new short-term
gilts to attract their funds. This means the government will be under more
pressure this year not to back down over National Savings.
There is one short-term alternative for societies: raising their wholesale
funds from capital markets. But the paucity of retail funds in the last year
means societies have limited capacity before they go over the limits on
holdings of wholesale funds set by the Building Societies Commission. The
limits average about 30 per cent of assets.
Halifax, the largest society, argues that it has plenty of capacity because
it was only at 15.2 per cent wholesale funding at the end of January. But
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester is at 25 per cent, and could bring in only Pounds
800m by raising its wholesale funds a further five percentage points.
A substantial rise in mortgage demand could therefore bring uncomfortable
funding pressure to bear later this year. Mr Adrian Coles, external affairs
manager of the Building Societies Association, said: 'If the housing market
does recover, it would obviously put some societies under strain.'
For now, societies can bear the strain. Mr Jim Birrell, Halifax chief
executive, said: 'We do not have a funding problem, but we might be forced
to seek alternatives if the mortgage market picks up fast.'
All this means that the battle between the government and mortgage lenders
is likely to be delayed until later this year, but is unlikely to be avoided
altogether. When it comes, the growing deficit means there will be less
chance of the government giving in to societies' complaints.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Community care guidelines attacked
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL AUTHORITY social services directors yesterday attacked guidelines
issued by the government for its care-in-the-community proposals.
The proposals, which are due to be implemented on Thursday, will give local
authorities a leading role in assessing needs and arranging care for the
elderly, disabled and mentally ill.
The directors said guidance on measuring the care needs was 'unrealistic'
and should be more precise. The Association of Directors of Social Services
is seeking discussions with the Department of Health and local authority
associations to clarify the guidance.
Fears about the reforms' funding have been fuelled by a government circular,
which has been interpreted as advising councils not to tell people what
their needs are, in case they cannot be met.
A second circular - intended to allay local authority fears - predicted that
town halls would face legal challenges from people dissatisfied with
community care.
It has also emerged that ministers have no plans to collate evidence of
needs that are not met - leaving the government without a way to check the
effectiveness of community care.
A survey published yesterday said social services staff assessing the
community care requirements of disabled people were failing to report needs
they considered too expensive or difficult to fulfil.
The report, based on interviews with 50 disabled people and conducted by the
poverty research group The Joseph Rowntree Foundation, studies community
care practices in two unidentified local authority areas.

<TEXT>
SCOTTISHPOWER, the larger of the two Scottish electricity companies,
yesterday bucked the trend of electricity companies in Britain by raising
its domestic tariffs. The English and Welsh regional electricity companies
have cut or frozen their domestic tariffs.
ScottishPower is to put the price of electricity for domestic customers up
2.8 per cent in 1993-94, taking account of inflation forecasts and predicted
cost rises.
In northern Scotland, Scottish Hydro-Electric yesterday froze tariffs at
1992 levels and made a special reduction of 2.3 per cent per unit for those
who use less electricity.
ScottishPower said it paid its customers a Pounds 20m rebate from last
November after it became clear it had overestimated inflation for 1992-93.
If it had not done that it would be freezing its prices now, the company
said. Its domestic tariffs were still among the lowest in the UK.
The Southern Scotland Electricity Consumers committee said ScottishPower was
entitled to its increase.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Buy-out of Leyland Daf's African operations backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS seeking to buy out Leyland Daf's six truck assembly and
distribution operations in Africa have won backing from Standard Bank
London, UK subsidiary of South Africa's Standard Bank Investment
Corporation.
Neither the bank or the buy-out team would last night provide specific
details of the support. The buy-out attempt is being led by Mr Arthur
Zammit, managing director of Daf International, based at Eindhoven in the
Netherlands.
Daf International was responsible for the former UK-Dutch truck
manufacturers' overseas sales but the six African companies form part of the
Leyland Daf receivership in the UK.
The operations employ 1,500 people and are based in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Ghana,
Uganda, Tanzania and Malawi. They are primarily assemblers of truck kits
produced by Leyland Daf's plant in Leyland, Lancashire, for third world
countries.
Mr Zammit said there were three main aims behind the buy-out: to preserve
continuity of operations at the six companies, which predate the Leyland-Daf
merger of 1987; to preserve the UK and African work forces; and to maintain
distribution networks which, he claims, are 'unique' in Africa.
Leyland was once the biggest exporter of trucks and buses to Africa.
The Littlewoods home shopping group yesterday boosted Leyland Daf's
Birmingham vans operation, also the subject of management buy-out proposals,
with a new order for 518 vans worth Pounds 6m.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Lift-truck sales show 25% boost
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF lift trucks and other warehouse equipment have risen by 25 per cent
year-on-year in the last four months, raising hopes that the three-year
recession in the UK materials handling industry is over.
The British Industrial Truck Association said that some 5,000 units were
sold in the four months from November to February.
Warehousing equipment sales have been particularly strong in the food
industry because of the trend towards third-party distribution. But even the
counterbalanced trucks used widely in manufacturing industry saw sales rise
by 15 per cent to 20 per cent.
Mr Graham Lovatt, vice-president for marketing at Hyster Europe and a senior
official in the truck association, said yesterday that the sector's UK sales
rose 1 per cent to 2 per cent last year to 15,000 units, compared with an
overall fall of 10 per cent for Europe.
Even so, the UK market is still a long way short of its 1988 peak of 25,000
units. Mr Tony de Mesquita, the association's president and director for
external affairs at Lansing-Linde, said there was a 'massive' oversupply of
equipment, and margins were negligible because of price discounting.
The lift-truck industry is cautious about predicting an end of the recession
because of recent 'false dawns' but the upturn over the four months to
February does appear to mirror a rise in confidence generally among the
industry's customers.
Mr Mesquita said domestic conditions, notably the UK's low inflation rate
and interest rates, looked reasonable for recovery but export opportunities
were being severely affected by the downturn in the rest of Europe, which
would get worse before it got better.
In the first two months of this year, UK sales of counterbalanced trucks
rose 22 per cent whereas, Mr Lovatt said, sales in Germany and France fell
by 30 per cent and 45 per cent respectively.
Although the present recession has not been as severe as that suffered by
the industry a decade ago, when sales dropped by nearly 50 per cent, it has
lasted longer. The UK now accounts for just 10 per cent of the European
market, compared with 15 per cent at the 1988 peak.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Efforts to liberalise air routes to US face test
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS by the UK and US governments to liberalise air transport between the
two countries will be put to the test by United Airlines's agreement to
acquire USAir's London-Philadelphia route. .
United, one of the three largest US carriers, said yesterday that it planned
to transfer the route to serve the London Heathrow to Chicago market.
The carrier added that it would not go ahead with the Dollars 14.5m (Pounds
9.7m) route acquisition if it did not secure authority from the UK
government to transfer the service to Chicago, its principal hub.
Under the UK-US bilateral aviation agreement, United cannot operate services
from Chicago to London. But the carrier hopes for approval for the switch
following the US government go-ahead for the move by British Airways to buy
a 19.9 per cent stake in USAir for Dollars 300m. As part of the deal, USAir
agreed to dispose of three routes to London.
Mr Stephen Wolf, United's chairman, said the proposal to switch the
Philadelphia route to Chicago gave the UK government an early opportunity to
show its commitment to expanding air services between Britain and the US.
United, together with American and Delta, had fiercely opposed the BA-USAir
deal unless the Washington authorities secured greater access for US
carriers into the UK market and especially Heathrow airport.
Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary, is due to hold air
liberalisation talks in Washington next month with Mr Federico Pena, his US
counterpart.
Services from Heathrow to Chicago, the largest hub in the US, are currently
operated by BA and American Airlines.

Beijing at the start of a four-day visit.
A first contract for the purchase of six Airbus A340s is due to be signed
during his visit, he added, after meeting Mr Wu Yi, the Chinese foreign
trade minister.
Chinese officials also presented the German delegation with a list of 200
acquisitions, worth about Dollars 30bn (Pounds 21.1bn). The purchases,
spread over the next seven years, include steel works, high-speed trains,
transport technology and telecommunications equipment. China is also
considering buying two power stations and ships.
Links with east German enterprises should be strengthened by the creation of
a trade commission, due to meet in Berlin in September. Short-term contracts
for goods from east German enterprises, worth about Dollars 150m and mostly
for textiles, were announced.

exports

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TIME was when the Swiss could, and did, get away with exporting weapons
discreetly to anyone.
No more. Last Friday Mr Walter Gubler, chief executive of Pilatus, a small
Swiss aircraft manufacturer, was dismissed after reports in the press that
the company had sold aircraft to the Burmese government knowing they would
be fitted with weapons.
According to other press reports, the company's PC-7 and PC-9 single engine
training aircraft, modified for military use, had also been involved in
conflicts in countries including Iraq and Angola.
Pilatus, a subsidiary of the Zurich based Oerlikon-Buhrle weapons and
engineering group, has admitted PC-9s were tested for weapons use in Burma
in 1987 in the presence of two of its engineers.
At a hastily called press conference, Mr Ernst Thomke, chairman, admitted
the company had made fundamental mistakes and offended the spirit of the
Swiss war equipment law.
The company is clinging desperately to a SFr250m (Pounds 111.5m) order to
sell 60 of its PC-7s to the South African government. Without the order
there would be big redundancies among the 1,000 staff.
Shortly after the order was announced last December, the South African
committee of the UN Security Council complained to the Swiss government that
it violated the UN embargo on arms shipments to South Africa.
The Swiss government and Pilatus, backed up by Pretoria, said then that the
aircraft were to be used only for training. They said the wings of the PC-7s
needed to be strengthened to carry auxiliary fuel tanks because of the large
distances flown in South Africa.
But as evidence emerged that other customers had used the under-wing
auxiliary fuel tank attachments for bombs, the Swiss government changed its
tune. Three weeks ago Mr Kaspar Villiger, the Swiss defence minister,
threatened publicly to block the order 'if it cannot be guaranteed that
subsequent arming is ruled out by technical modifications'.
Pilatus said last week that the wings of PC-7s and PC-9s ordered by certain
countries would in future be modified so they could only carry additional
fuel tanks.

FT  30 MAR 93 / World Trade News: Co-operation lifts Russian aero industry -
The fruits of international links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON and PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW spirit of international co-operation in the Russian aerospace industry
bears its most elaborate fruit today when the first airliner to be jointly
built by Russian and US companies is rolled out in Moscow.
The Ilyushin IL-96M is Russia's challenge to the new generation of long-haul
wide-body airliners from the European Airbus consortium and Boeing and
McDonnell Douglas of the US.
Powered by four US-built Pratt &amp; Whitney engines and fitted with advanced US
fly-by-wire technology and digital flight navigation equipment, the IL-96M
will be able to carry up to 311 passengers in three classes non-stop on
routes of up to 7,000 nautical miles. When it enters service around 1995 it
will be competing against the Airbus A340, the Boeing 777 and 767, and the
McDonnell Douglas MD11.
'We have worked with 18 American firms on this project. That's why it is
truly a Russian-American plane,' says Mr Genrikh Novozhilov, Ilyushin's
general designer.
The long-haul aircraft is to be produced in Voronezh, in southern Russia.
The partners in the venture are expected to try to sell it to hard-currency
paying customers for about Dollars 75m, 25-30 per cent less than similar
aircraft from the west.
Mr Novozhilov says the US and Russian partners have received requests for
options on 30 aircraft from potential customers, including Russian
International Airlines, Aeroflot's international division.
The IL-96M is not the only recent product of Russian aerospace collaboration
with the west. Tupolev has equipped its TU-204 mid-range 200-seater twin jet
airliner with Rolls-Royce engines to compete against the Boeing 757, and has
targeted China, India and the Middle East as well as the former Soviet Union
as potential markets.
Another Russian manufacturer, Yakovlev, is working with US suppliers to
modernise its business and commuter aircraft.
Although the world commercial aerospace industry is undergoing a prolonged
decline, western manufacturers believe Russia offers strong long-term
potential. In its latest study of the industry, Boeing says despite
short-term political and economic uncertainties, Russia offers not only a
potentially large market but 'substantial' aircraft manufacturing
capability. Boeing estimates that the former Soviet market will require
2,000 new jets for internal services and 250 aircraft for international
routes during the next 18 years.
'The technological potential is tremendous and the capacity is out of this
world, but the financial situation is very tight and the structure of the
Russian industry is complex and confused,' says Mr Jurgen Schrempp,
president of Deutsche Aerospace, which has been scouting for co-operation
opportunities in Russia.
Mr Schrempp sees Russian manufacturers eventually co-operating on large
scale projects, including the development of a 600-800 seat super jumbo or a
next generation supersonic airliner. Both Tupolev and Ilyushin, which have
their own designs for a high capacity aircraft, are candidates for such a
venture.
Mr Louis Gallois, the head of Aerospatiale of France, signed a wide-ranging
protocol with Russian manufacturers in Moscow this month earmarking six
potential projects for co-operation. They included the development of the
Mil MI-38 multi-purpose helicopter, the proposed Tupolev TU-334 medium-range
airliner, liquid propulsion boosters for the European Ariane space rocket,
co-operation with the Franco-Italian ATR regional aircraft group as well as
collaboration in super jumbos and supersonic aircraft.
But financing and the industry's current structure remain big problems.
Faced with an abrupt reduction in state subsidies, Aviastar, which builds
the Antonov AN124 cargo aircraft and the TU-204 airliner, has begun to
manufacture furniture and tractors to generate cash.
Apart from Aviastar's financial difficulties, common to the entire industry,
there is also friction between the manufacturer and the Tupolev design
bureau. The division between design bureaus and manufacturing facilities,
which never mattered under the centralised control of a single aviation
ministry now dissolved, has frustrated western partners. Aerospatiale, for
example, has experienced such difficulties with the MI-38 helicopter.
Mr Novozhilov says he plans to create an inter-state corporation, merging
his bureau with the factories which make Ilyushin aircraft, including one in
Tashkent, the capital of newly independent Uzbekistan. 'This will deal with
everything, from design to serial production to after-sales service,' he
says.
There are some misgivings in Russia over the trend toward collaboration. Mr
Novozhilov believes that Aerospatiale's proposal to Yakovlev to help
manufacture and sell Franco-Italian ATR regional turboprops is one example
of a western company 'striving to break up' Russia's aerospace industry by
taking advantage of its difficulties. With the IL-114, he argues Ilyushin
already has its own equivalent of the ATR, and warns that the different
design bureaus and Russian manufacturers are pursuing a dangerous policy of
'each man for himself'.
The Russian state has promised to focus support on industries it considers
worth saving. There is no doubt that aerospace is one of them, but an
industrial policy has yet to emerge.

<TEXT>
MR Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, intends to step aside at the end of June when the six-month extension
of his mandate granted last year expires.
Sources close to Mr Dunkel, who was appointed in 1980, said yesterday that
he neither wanted nor expected to be asked for a second extension.
There had been suggestions Mr Dunkel might be requested to stay a further
six months to oversee completion of the six-year Uruguay Round of global
trade negotiations, already two years overdue. The new US administration has
said it wants to finish the Round by the end of 1993.
But there seems to be growing consensus among Gatt members that new blood is
needed, not only to help move the Uruguay Round negotiations but also to
provide fresh leadership for the 106-nation organisation. Mr Dunkel's
American deputy, Mr Charles Carlisle, has made clear his wish to step down
this summer, and the second deputy post, traditionally held by a third world
national, has been vacant since 1991.
Gatt members, who appoint the director-general and deputies, have already
begun the lengthy process of political horsetrading to achieve regional and
economic balance between the top jobs. But, with Gatt's future dependent on
the outcome of the Uruguay Round, they do not yet know if they are seeking a
political heavyweight to run a powerful world trade organisation or a
capable administrator to operate a contractual trade agreement.
Mr Peter Sutherland, former EC competition commissioner, who is Irish, is
seen as a possible successor to Mr Dunkel, a Swiss. Other names floated
include Mr Brian Mulroney, the ousted Canadian prime minister, Britain's
Lord Lawson, and Mexico's President Carlos Salinas.
Mr Warren Lavorel, currently chief US negotiator for the Uruguay Round, has
been tipped to succeed Mr Carlisle.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Clinton team fixes sights on Medicaid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Clinton administration is considering phasing out the Medicaid health
programme for the poor and integrating the provision of healthcare for low-
and middle-income families as part of a series of changes to make the health
system fairer and more cost efficient.
Speculation that Medicaid might be phased out surfaced yesterday as the
White House healthcare reform task force held its first public meeting in
Washington, just five weeks before President Bill Clinton is due to send a
reform proposal to Congress. The meeting was due to hear evidence from
consumers, business, the medical profession, unions, minorities and the
health insurance industry.
Mr Al Gore, vice-president, pledged at the beginning of a marathon session,
scheduled to last 13 hours, that every American would be delivered from the
fear of unpayable medical bills. He was standing in for Mrs Hillary Rodham
Clinton, chairwoman of the task force, who was in Arkansas with her sick
father.
Medicaid was set up by the Johnson administration in 1965 and is financed by
state and federal government. The cost of the scheme has escalated sharply
in recent years even though it covers only about half of those living below
the official poverty line.
The New York Times reported yesterday that the task force was considering
phasing out Medicaid as a way to end 'segregation of the poor' in a
low-quality programme in which access to care was more tightly restricted
than for more affluent Americans. The administration was considering
introducing several new benefits for the poor, including more generous
dental care and transport to surgeries.
The reform plan is expected to be based on a variant of 'managed
competition'. Leaks in recent weeks suggest the administration wants to
group Americans in large regional 'health insurance purchasing
co-operatives' that would buy care on behalf of individuals and companies
from networks of competing providers in the private sector.
The hope is that the HIPCs would have the market power to drive a hard
bargain with doctors and hospitals, thus restraining the rate of healthcare
inflation.
But many prominent Democrats, including Mr Mario Cuomo, governor of New York
state, are lobbying for more direct controls on the price and volume of
medical services.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Judgment on hold in Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN what was billed as the first important indication from the Clinton
administration about its views on Latin America, the US will tell the
InterAmerican Development Bank today that the region is to be a top priority
in Washington.
Whether Latin Americans will take these words at face value is another
matter. The official due to give this keynote speech - Mr Larry Summers, the
deputy to treasury secretary Lloyd Bentsen responsible for international
affairs - will be in Washington working on the package of support measures
being proposed for Russia. The words will instead be delivered by Mr James
Fall, deputy assistant treasury secretary for developing nations at the
Treasury.
'It's an interesting signal,' said Mr Enrique Garcia, a former Bolivian
planning minister, on Mr Summers's absence.
Latin Americans may further be led to question US intentions when they learn
that some relief agreed by the Bush administration on debts of some Latin
American countries to the US government has been cancelled by the Office of
Management and Budget in its search for budgetary cuts.
A US official said much of the debt relief announced in December and January
 -when agreements were signed with Argentina, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador
Jamaica and Uruguay - has been struck out for budgetary savings of about
Dollars 90m.
This debt relief was one element of the Enterprise for Americas initiative
launched by President George Bush in June 1990. This initiative, hailed in
Latin America as offering a new basis for partnership with their powerful
northern neighbours, included relief on modest sums of debt owed to the US
government, the establishment of a fund to encourage reform of investment
regimes and the prospect of a free trade area from Alaska to Tierra del
Fuego.
The loss - perhaps only until another tax year - of a small amount of debt
relief, and Mr Summers's non-appearance may be only symbolic. But then the
Enterprise for Americas was at least as important symbolically as in
substance. A slap in the face is unlikely to be intended by the Clinton
administration - but that may be what is inferred. As the thousands of
bankers and investors in Hamburg for this conference testify, Latin America
does not, at least for now, present the administration with a foreign policy
crisis.
Mr Summers's speech will underline that the furtherance of the region's
economic and democratic reforms 'remains a priority'. There will be
continued encouragement for market-oriented reforms of which privatisation
remains an important element. The InterAmerican Development Bank will be the
main vehicle in support of these objectives, along with a heightened concern
for social issues: health, education and the environment.
But for most of Mr Fall's listeners today, the most important words will be
on trade, in particular on how the Clinton administration views the idea of
a hemispheric free trade zone. Latin American governments, having
unilaterally lowered trade barriers, worry that the hitherto open US may
become more protectionist under Mr Clinton.
'Latin America is the fastest growing market for US goods,' said Mr Enrique
Iglesias, president of the IADB. 'We have to convince the US that we are
part of the solution, not part of the problem.'
The administration is also committed to negotiating a trade agreement with
Chile. Mr Mickey Kantor, the US trade representative, says he favours the
extension southwards of the North American Free Trade Agreement, already
signed with Canada and Mexico.
Yet it is clear that this vision differs in important respects from that of
President Bush, with its emphasis on economic growth.
Mr Kantor talks of the importance of Nafta in 'harmonising upwards workers'
standards' and emphasises that the US supports Nafta on the basis that new
side accords are negotiated on labour standards and the environment.
Some Nafta supporters worry that the tougher the restrictions imposed by the
side agreements, the fewer the companies that will be interested in moving
south to take advantage of Mexico's cheaper labour. That would please
American trade unions but render the accord less useful to a Mexican
government seeking investment.
Indeed, if the Clinton administration's vision of a hemispheric free trade
area includes ideas such as these, it is less likely to receive widespread
acceptance in Latin America's capitals.

MOST of the countries in Latin America without debt relief accords with
creditor banks could secure agreements by the end of the year, according to
bankers at the InterAmerican Development Bank annual meeting in Hamburg.
They say significant progress has been made in recent talks with a number of
Latin American governments. 'This should be a year where we can finalise
Argentina and Brazil and get agreements in principle hopefully with Ecuador,
Peru and Panama,' said Mr William Rhodes, vice-chairman of Citibank, a
leading Latin American creditor.
His statement reflects a growing sense of progress at the meeting and, if
correct, means only the Dominican Republic is left among significant bank
debtors without some agreement this year.
Other developments are:
Argentina is set to finalise its deal on April 7, a year after it signed an
agreement in principle.
A more favourable mix than expected of choices by banks from the six options
negotiated under Brazil's debt reduction agreement. Furthermore, the amount
of debt covered by the agreement is some Dollars 3bn-Dollars 5bn less than
the Dollars 40bn (Pounds 28.1bn) expected, making a finalisation of the
agreement an easier prospect.
Banks are shuffling their options, however, as they have chosen too high a
proportion (63.1 per cent) of relatively expensive 'par' bonds for the
government's liking.
The Ecuadorean government and banks made 'some progress' in a meeting on
Sunday, but an important obstacle is the lack of any interest payment since
July. The two sides meet on April 6 in New York.
Panama and its banks, led now by Citibank, are to begin talks on Dollars
1.9bn of principal and Dollars 1.1bn on back interest, unpaid since December
1987.
Peru and its bank creditors are set to meet in May. Bilateral meetings
between Mr Jorge Camet, finance minister, and bank lenders have taken place
in Hamburg.
Bolivia is set to sign today an agreement covering the buyback for cash of
94 per cent of its remaining bank debt.

The German government has indicated it would hold off support for a capital
increase of the InterAmerican Development Bank unless there was increasing
representation for shareholder governments from outside the Americas in the
running of the bank, writes Stephen Fidler.
Non-regional shareholders do not have permanent representation on the board.
Mr Hans-Peter Repnik, parliamentary state secretary at the Ministry of
Economic Co-operation and Development, also questioned whether a large
increase in capital was necessary for the bank, given that it was to reduce
lending to cover balance of payments deficits.

figures released yesterday, Reuter reports from Washington.
The rise last month follows a sharp 12.7 per cent decline in January, the
worst in a decade.
Separate figures released yesterday showed US personal income rose 0.2 per
cent in February to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of Dollars 5,230bn
(Pounds 3,683bn), after a gain of 0.5 per cent in January.
Spending increased 0.6 per cent in February to a seasonally adjusted Dollars
4,260bn, following a gain of 0.3 per cent in January.
The savings rate - savings as a percentage of income - fell to 4.1 per cent
from 4.4 per cent in January and December.
Wages and salaries, the most closely-watched component of income, fell 0.1
per cent, the first drop since September, following four healthy increases.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAMAICA votes today in a general election which opinion polls indicate will
give the incumbent People's National party a clear victory. This would hand
Mr P J Patterson, the prime minister, the mandate he is seeking to continue
economic reforms started four years ago.
Mr Edward Seaga, leader of the opposition Jamaica Labour party and a former
prime minister, has suggested, however, that the race will be closer than
many expect.
A poll published at the weekend gave the PNP a 7 point lead and possibly 44
of the 60 parliamentary seats at stake.
The three-week campaign has been marred by violence. Ten people have been
killed despite a code of conduct signed by political leaders committing all
candidates to restraining their supporters.
Mr Patterson called the election 11 months earlier than necessary,
apparently hoping to capitalise on dissent within the opposition. He took
over the premiership a year ago when Mr Michael Manley retired because of
poor health.
The electorate is being asked to decide on the style and form of the
economy's management, rather than economic direction. The PNP has switched
direction on economic policy, advocating and implementing free-market
initiatives with the divestment of state enterprises and deregulation of the
foreign exchange market.
Mr Seaga has argued, however, that the government has moved too far and too
fast in deregulating the economy. Flotation of the Jamaican dollar 18 months
ago was done too soon, he argues.
But the JLP's credibility was dented by a rebel faction attacking the
leadership. Most of the rebels are back in the fold but another election
defeat for Mr Seaga is likely to raise questions about his leadership.

FT  30 MAR 93 / India to drop World Bank dam loans: Government refuses to
meet stiff conditions on Dollars 3bn project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL

<DATELINE>
   NEW DELHI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government is to ask the World Bank to cancel its remaining loans
for a half-finished Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) scheme to dam the Narmada
River in north-western India, following intense criticism of the project's
impact on the environment and on villagers who will lose their land.
But the Indian authorities are likely to press ahead with the project which
would generate hydroelectricity and bring irrigation and drinking water to
about 30m people.
The Indian government is expected to disclose today that it will not meet
tough conditions laid down by the World Bank six months ago for its
continued participation in the scheme. India was asked by the bank to
improve detailed plans for resettling displaced villagers and to prepare a
full study of the project's environmental effects. The deadline set by the
bank expires tomorrow.
The bank's withdrawal will highlight the growing power of international
environmental campaigners and raise doubts about the value of projects such
as dams in developing countries. It could also prompt questions about future
relations between aid agencies and Third World governments.
Much of the Dollars 450m loan the World Bank committed to the project has
already been spent. The bank will now block the release of the remaining
Dollars 170m and could persuade the project's other foreign backers,
including the Japanese government which has promised loans worth Y25bn
(Pounds 146.2m), to withdraw.
The Narmada project, first mooted in 1946, was delayed by disputes between
the three states which share the Narmada's waters - Gujarat, Maharashtra and
Madhya Pradesh. The arguments were resolved only in 1979 and it was not
until 1985 that the World Bank approved its loan.
By then, environmental lobbyists' power in India and overseas was growing.
Economists were starting to question the merits of big dams, in that they
rarely delivered the full benefits expected and caused environmental damage.
But the Indian government and the World Bank saw the Narmada scheme as a
chance to learn from past mistakes. So the scheme went ahead with stringent
conditions for resettling and paying compensation to displaced villagers and
for an environmental master plan.
The conditions were not met, however. Pressure from activist groups forced
the World Bank in 1991 to commission an unprecedented independent review by
Mr Bradford Morse, a former senior US development aid administrator, and Mr
Thomas Berger, a former Canadian Supreme Court judge.
The report, delivered last summer, condemned the alleged failure to protect
the environment or the interests of displaced villagers.
While World Bank officials continued to back the project, the bank's
directors, representing member countries, began to voice doubts. The US,
Japan and Germany, among others, last autumn raised the possibil ity of
dropping the scheme. But a bank board meeting in October agreed to give
India until March 31 to meet new conditions.
India has been unable to forge a consensus on the bank's conditions between
the central government and three interested states, not least because New
Delhi has been preoccupied with the recent wave of inter-religious violence.
Some Indian officials will be relieved they can continue with the scheme
without time-consuming monitoring from the World Bank. They claim the bank
has exercised inordinate influence, given it was contributing only some 15
per cent of the funds.
But the World Bank's pullout could well boost the efforts of Indian
anti-Narmada campaigners, who have won national attention by staging
demonstrations on the banks of the reservoir which is steadily filling up
behind the Sardar Sarovar Dam, the biggest of several being built across the
Narmada and its tributaries.

EGYPT believes that only 'small measures' are required from Israel for
Middle East peace negotiations to resume on schedule in Washington on April
20.
President Hosni Mubarak, speaking after weekend talks in Cairo with
President Hafez al-Assad of Syria and Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, said that he would be contacting Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli prime minister, after his talks next week with
President Bill Clinton.
Mr Mubarak also gave notice to the US that on the question of civil and
military aid, Egypt expects to be treated no less well than Israel. Mr Rabin
recently received an assurance from the US that there were no plans for any
reduction in the Dollars 3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) that Israel receives annually.
The US commitment to Egypt is for Dollars 2.1bn a year, a sum exceeded only
by aid to Israel.
On the peace process, Mr Mubarak said that Mr Rabin had already made clear
that the deportation of 415 Palestinians in December - the issue blocking
the resumption of negotiations - was an 'extraordinary' act. He praised the
Israeli leader for taking 'some good steps' and added that his bilateral
contacts with Mr Rabin were a key factor in getting talks restarted. He
planned to contact Mr Rabin as soon as he returned from Washington.
But Mr Mubarak, who has emerged this week as the key intermediary in efforts
to revive the peace talks, warned that time was running out. 'We are anxious
to help all the parties involved, with the co-operation of the US, to reach
a comprehensive settlement.'
He had discussed the issues preventing the resumption of talks at the
weekend with President Assad and Mr Arafat and said 'there are still some
clouds.' But he added: 'We are trying to solve the problem of the deportees.
I do not want to miss the April 20 date because I think that the efforts now
being made may be the last efforts for solving the Middle East problem. We
don't want to miss this train. This is the last train for peace and I want
to make sure all the passengers are on it.'
Mr Mubarak believed it was vital for the Clinton administration to become a
full partner in the peace process, not simply to put pressure on Israel but
to 'help and mediate'. 'That does not mean we are going to neglect having
the Americans put pressure on the Israelis. But the main thing is to have
good contact with the Israelis. We are working hard with the Israelis in
this sense.'
He cautioned other Arab governments against over-reacting to recent
statements by Israel and the US on strategic co-operation. 'There is nothing
new in this,' he said. 'They have co-operation in so many ways. I have told
them not be be nervous about this.'
Mr Mubarak said he would also be discussing Iraq with President Clinton and
warned that the break-up of that country would be very dangerous.
'All of us would suffer. It would be very dangerous for all for the whole
area, including Europe. You may not realise it now. You would have three
countries creating problems. What I shall be discussing with President
Clinton is ways of helping the people of Iraq.'

<TEXT>
CHINA yesterday installed a younger, more technocratic government to
spearhead speedy economic reform demanded by its ageing leader, Mr Deng
Xiaoping.
The National People's Congress, or parliament, also accepted a new
constitution that enshrines Mr Deng's capitalist-style economic reforms and
confirms China's opening to the outside world.
Mr Zhu Rongji, 65, known as China's economic 'czar', was elevated to the
post of senior vice-premier with specific responsibility of ensuring that Mr
Deng's reformist legacy is preserved.
The NPC also approved one of the largest government reshuffles in history
with 22 new ministers out of 41, including the appointment of Madam Wu Yi,
who heads the powerful Trade Ministry and is regarded as a rising star.
New vice premiers include Mr Qian Qichen, 65, who also retains his post as
foreign minister, and Mr Li Lanqing, 61, the former trade minister. The
fourth vice premier is Mr Zou Jiahua, 67, who has already served one
five-year term.
China's new constitution - the fifth since the founding of the People's
Republic - embraces the phrase 'socialist market economy' to describe the
country's capitalist-style reforms that produced an economic growth rate
last year nearing 13 per cent.
The constitutional change mirrors resolutions adopted at the 14th Communist
party conference last October which gave formal blessing to the move away
from rigid central economic control.
China's new leadership is meant to provide both the expertise and commitment
needed to underpin the country's economic revolution once Mr Deng, who has
aged noticeably in the past year, leaves the scene.
This eighth NPC since 1949 - China's parliaments meet annually and run for
five-year terms - has also provided Mr Deng and his reformist supporters
with an opportunity to strengthen the collective leadership.
The appointment of Mr Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Communist party
and chairman of the Military Commission, to the additional post of state
president is part of this process.

TWO WEALTHY businessmen with no direct experience of government will contest
Nigeria's presidential elections, due to take place in June.
A scheduled handover of power in August would end a decade of military rule
in the country.
Mr Bashir Tofa, a businessman from the northern city of Kano, won almost
unanimous support from the 5,000 delegates at the National Republican
Convention (NRC) convention on Sunday in Port Harcourt.
Mr Mko Abiola, who owns a domestic airline and newspaper group, was endorsed
at the Social Democratic Party (SDP) convention in the central Nigerian city
of Jos on Sunday.
Both men are Moslems but have contrasting approaches to politics. Mr Tofa
has a low-key style but lacks the popular appeal and oratory of Mr Abiola.
A key factor in the outcome will be the choice of running mates. Mr Tofa is
likely to chose a Christian from the south, while some observers expect Mr
Abiola to select a prominent northern Christian.
But there is a strong possibility that Mr Abiola may be confident enough of
the backing of the predominantly Christian Yoruba ethnic group, to which he
belongs, to choose a northern Moslem politician in order to strengthen his
appeal in the region.
In the NRC convention, Mr Tofa heavily defeated his main rivals from the
north, Dr Dalhatu Tafida and Mr Samalia Mamman, for the nomination. Mr Joe
Nwodo, a prominent lawyer from Enugu, finished third and is expected to be
Mr Tofa's nomination for the vice-presidency.
Mr Abiola narrowly won the first ballot of the SDP's convention, with 3,617
votes, 392 more than his main competitor, Mr Baba Gana Kingibe.
Voting at the conventions was well ordered and peaceful. Since January the
National Electoral Commission has assumed direct control of the two parties'
presidential campaigns and has so far succeeded in eliminating electoral
irregularities which marred last year's primaries and led to the
disqualification of all last year's presidential aspirants.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Manila set to deal with crippling power shortages:
'Brownouts' have been a factor behind the nation's largely stagnant economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PHILIPPINE Congress seems set to grant 'emergency powers' to President
Fidel Ramos to deal more decisively with electric-power shortages crippling
the economy.
Much of the main Luzon island, including Metro-Manila, has been suffering
daily power disruptions that have become longer - up to eight hours on some
days - since the start of the year. The shortages, or 'brownouts', have been
a significant factor behind the largely stagnant economy over the past few
years.
In spite of reservations in some quarters because of their association with
the strong-arm regime of the late Ferdinand Marcos, the emergency powers are
viewed as necessary by Mr Ramos's economy managers, whose campaign for
reforms in the energy sector have run into opposition.
The Philippines is due to resume negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund on April 15 on a medium-term economic programme to succeed the
18-month stabilisation programme that expires tomorrow. Power-rate increases
necessary to help narrow budget deficits are vital to the successful
conclusion of the discussions.
The Philippines, though enjoying historically high reserves of more than
Dollars 5bn (Pounds 3.5bn), feels it still needs the IMF's 'seal of good
housekeeping' because its traditional creditors anchor their own lending
programmes to the country on such imprimatur.
After the first round of negotiations last February ended without a deal,
other multilateral and bilateral lending institutions have also suspended
disbursements for power-related projects. Talks for new financing have also
been frozen.
The Philippines has presented to the IMF a 'growth-oriented' programme
seeking financial support of some Dollars 800m-Dollars 1bn over the next
three years. Mr Ramon del Rosario, finance secretary, expects this programme
to be the last of the series the country has sought from the fund.
Under the programme, overall growth this year will be targeted at 3.5-4.5
per cent, with inflation being kept at 7.5 per cent. The programme aims at
putting the economy on track towards double-digit growth rates by the end of
the Ramos administration in 1998.
However, revenue-enhancement measures and power-rate increases have been
imposed as conditions by the IMF. These are aimed at narrowing the fiscal
deficit, a chronic problem that had led to high inflation for years.
The power-rate increases, for the state National Power Corporation
(Napocor), were approved by the government late last year, but a court case
filed by a lawyers' group resulted in a restraining order issued by the
Supreme Court. Without the higher rates, Napocor will not be able to meet
returns that its creditors, mainly the World Bank, require on its
operations.
On the other hand, new power plant projects being planned by the government
have also been facing delays resulting from complicated bidding procedures
and in securing environmental clearances.
Mr Ramos's emergency powers will be aimed at overcoming these circuitous
procedures to keep energy programmes on the move again. The power-rate
increases, for instance, would be reimposed, although the courts will still
continue to hear opponents' arguments.
Also expected to get a boost are the baseload power plants targeted to be on
line by 1995. These plants will have a combined capacity of 1,600MW, enough
to cover present deficiencies and provide a comfortable reserve that will
allow Napocor to refurbish its ageing plants.
Napocor's power plants are about 25 years old and prone to breakdown. Last
year, the government devised a programme to put up six fast-track plants
that should be ready to meet the increased demand during the summer months
starting in April.
The first of such fast-track plants, the 100MW Hopewell-2, is set to be
inaugurated tomorrow. On April 11, two others are due for commissioning,
with the rest due to come on stream over the next four months.
The fast-track projects are gas turbines or diesel-fired plants, which make
them expensive over long periods of operation. These plants, according to
officials, can only be stop-gap measures, and the real solution to the
problem is for construction of the baseload plants.
Meanwhile, many large business groups appear to have relied more on their
gut feelings rather than on Napocor's assurances on the fast-track plants,
and have gone on to acquire their own generating sets. Private economists
expect overall economic growth this year to reach only about 1.5 per cent,
owing to the power shortages.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Japanese groups' capital spending likely to fall 4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL spending by Japanese companies is likely to fall by 4 per cent next
fiscal year, according to the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, whose gloomy
forecast comes as some companies are hailing the end of the downturn.
A surge in Tokyo stock prices has stirred debate on whether a recovery is
imminent, but the LTCB's influential survey of corporate spending plans
found little reason for optimism.
The bank estimates capital spending will fall 3.9 per cent in the year
ending tomorrow, and another 4 per cent next fiscal year, the biggest drop
since 1970 and the first time that the bank has forecast two consecutive
years of decline.
'Virtually all industries are trimming their investments, the only
exceptions being mainly in the fields of electric power, gas and land
transportation,' LTCB said. 'Many industries that have been slow to adjust
to economic changes will finally begin cutting their investments in earnest
during fiscal 1993.'
The bank forecasts that investment in facilities and equipment by
manufacturing industry will fall 12.9 per cent in the next year, following a
15.6 per cent drop this year. Steel makers told the bank that they will be
cutting capital spending by 20.8 per cent.
Meanwhile, officials of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are finalising
details of an emergency economic package, likely to be unveiled on April 8.
The LDP yesterday held talks with opposition parties on the spending
proposals, which Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, wants to bring with
him on a Washington visit on April 15.
Opposition politicians yesterday demanded the package contain income tax
cuts of Y4,260bn (Pounds 25bn), which have been strongly opposed by the
finance ministry. The opposition argues the emphasis on infrastructure
spending in a package last year had little effect on the weakened confidence
of most consumers.
Japan's labour office ruled yesterday that a supermarket attendant who died
after working 360 days in a row was not a victim of karoshi or death from
overwork, Reuter adds from Tokyo. Kyodo news service quoted Labour Standards
Inspection officials in Yokohama as saying the man was not sick seven days
before his death, so his family was not entitled to compensation.
A claim filed by his widow said Yuji Iguchi, 43, worked 360 days during
1989. After taking the first three days off in 1990, he worked until
February 10, 1990, when he collapsed, dying two days later. Japan's labour
standards say a victim of karoshi must be sick or suffer injury one week
before death.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN DAWKINS, the Australian treasurer, yesterday sought to calm nerves
in financial markets by reaffirming the re-elected Labor government's
commitment to cut the federal budget deficit.
He said the Canberra government stood by its pre-election promise to cut the
deficit from about 4 per cent of gross domestic product this year to about
one per cent by 1996-97.
Mr Dawkins' comments contrasted sharply with reports last week that he
regarded the deficit as less important than a drop in unemployment from its
near record level of 11.1 per cent.
Fears that fiscal policy would be loosened sparked a wave of selling on
financial markets on Friday, but prices recovered after his comments.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Kanemaru out of detention on Y300m bail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER three weeks of humiliating detention, Mr Shin Kanemaru, fallen
'godfather' of Japanese politics, returned home yesterday after mustering
Y300m (Pounds 1.7m) in bail, a record figure for a politician facing trial.
Mr Kanemaru, 78, suffered the further indignity of having hospitals around
Tokyo refuse him admission for a check-up, apparently out of a fear his
presence would draw unwanted attention from the Japanese media.
Hundreds of reporters and photographers tracked his journey from the
detention centre, via a typical Tokyo traffic jam, to his home, where Mr
Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister and Mr Kanemaru's mah-jong
partner, was apparently awaiting him.
Prosecutors have charged Mr Kanemaru with evading Y119m in tax in 1987 and a
further Y920m between 1988 and 1989. The charges are linked to the discovery
of about Y6.7bn in gold bars, cash and debentures in his office and home,
where some of the gold was hidden under a carpet.
He had been in custody since March 6, but the Tokyo District Court ruled
that he be released on bail, as he is unlikely to flee the country and is in
poor health, suffering from diabetes and several other ailments.
The bail application was opposed by prosecutors, who argued that Mr Kanemaru
may hide or destroy evidence relevant to their continuing investigation into
alleged illegal donations to politicians by the construction industry. About
18 leading contractors have been raided, but no executives have yet been
charged.
Mr Kanemaru, who had run the largest faction in the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party, was famed for his close ties to the construction industry,
though much of the money he is said to have received is thought to have been
passed on down the line to more junior faction members.
Senior ministry of justice officials indicated yesterday that no further
charges are imminent against other LDP members, suggesting Mr Kanemaru alone
could be punished as a warning to other politicians, both government and
opposition.
The 'godfather's' fall has surprised most Japanese, who presumed last year
that prosecutors were intimidated by his reputation and connections. After
having admitted that he illegally received Y500m, he was fined a mere
Y200,000 and never directly questioned by prosecutors.
It is unclear whether the prosecutors intend to pursue cases against the
construction companies, which have allegedly divided up public works
contracts among themselves in the knowledge that the chosen contractor would
have political backing for the bid.
Mr Hirotaka Akamatsu, general secretary of the Social Democratic Party of
Japan, the largest opposition party, has visited the Fair Trade Commission,
the anti-monopoly body, to seek an investigation into alleged bid-rigging
uncovered by the prosecutors.
The party wants all 'Kanemaru connection' projects studied, and a review of
guidelines to the industry, which has announced plans to ensure no further
'misunderstandings' about political links occur.

FT  30 MAR 93 / EC defies itself and edges away from tele-scrutiny: Danes
frustrated at blocks on EC debates on TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's much-heralded decision at December's Edinburgh
summit to open up decision-making to greater public scrutiny is being
blocked by several states, to the consternation of the Danish presidency.
After the initial fanfare that greeted the televising of parts of three
council of ministers meetings in February, Danish plans to broadcast debates
in three EC ministerial meetings this month were vetoed.
Denmark has put down three more debates for TV access next Monday and
Tuesday. The member states' ambassadors to the EC will decide, probably
tomorrow, whether to agree to their request, in what is being seen as a test
of whether the 'openness' policy is substance or sham.
Denmark is anxious to demonstrate to its own people that there has been a
change in the EC's secretive decision-making, before Danes get their second
chance to ratify the Maastricht treaty on May 18. Part of the reason they
voted it down last June, Danish officials say, was fear that more and more
decisions affecting them were being taken behind closed doors in Brussels.
February's TV debut covered foreign ministers delivering set-piece speeches
on the year ahead, and EC finance ministers did much the same at a later
council. At the end of February, agriculture ministers submitted gracelessly
to having their posturing on this year's farm price package partially
televised, but felt bounced into accepting the cameras by Danish pressure.
'It was felt this was not the way to prepare people for more of this; they
felt set up,' said one EC diplomat.
Belgium, Portugal and Luxembourg - the member states most sceptical of the
exercise - blocked Danish suggestions for televising debates this month on
the development of EC transport policy, the EC strategy on global warming,
and policing of the common fisheries policy. They were supported passively
by what one EC diplomat called 'semi-silent voices' on the openness issue.
The Danish presidency has got agreement that the opening of Norway's EC
accession negotiations will be televised at next Monday's foreign ministers'
meeting in Luxembourg.
But the Danes also want TV access for a ministerial debate on the same day
on how to make the EC internal market work, and, on the following day, for a
discussion on 'employment and social dialogue' - which means the involvement
of employers and trade unions in EC decision-making.
'Edinburgh' - where it was decided unanimously that important policy debates
and new legislative proposals should be televised - 'should be implemented,'
a senior Danish official says.
But diplomats from member states which are middle-of-the-road on
'transparency' say little headway has been made on Denmark's latest demands.
The UK, in particular, is reticent about the employment debate.
From the Danish standpoint, the worst outcome might be agreement on
broadcasting the internal market debate, but not the employment debate. This
might confirm to Danish voters that the EC cares little about the issues to
which they give priority, such as social policy and the environment.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Call for tougher sanctions on Serbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA SILBER and MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL mediator Lord Owen said yesterday the world had to show
Bosnia's Serbs that it was determined to ensure a peace plan was implemented
in Bosnia.
He was speaking as UN relief workers used the second day of the ceasefire in
Bosnia to evacuate about 2,140 sick and wounded women, children and elderly
people from Srebrenica, the Moslem enclave in the eastern part of the
republic. Several died on the journey.
The evacuees, jammed into 19 lorries for the eight-hour triop, crossed Serb
lines into Tuzla. At least 45 people in the convoy were critically ill.
In Geneva, yesterday Lord Owen said he hoped the United Nations Security
Council would couple support for the peace plan with proposals for tougher
sanctions against the rump of Yugoslavia, made up of Serbia and Montenegro.
'There is no doubt that if Yugoslavia were to turn off the tap of strategic
supplies. . . the Bosnian Serbs would not be able to sustain the war for too
long,' he said.
Mr Warren Christopher, US secretary of state, said the US would intensify
diplomatic pressure on Bosnian Serbs to accept the peace plan and revive its
effort to enforce a Bosnia no-fly zone.
In New York, a deadline of midnight tomorrow for renewing the mandate of the
13,000-strong UN force in the former Yugoslavia added urgency to a new round
of Security Council deliberations.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN secretary general, recommending an extension,
said withdrawing the troops now would probably result in renewed
hostilities.
Nato is planning to send at least 50,000 troops to Bosnia to enforce the
peace plan, but only when all parties have signed. Mr Johan Joergen Holst,
the Norwegian defence minister, said yesterday the figure would probably be
more like 75,000, but that no country had so far committed forces.
Mr William Perry, US deputy defence secretary, told a meeting of defence
ministers from Nato, eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union in Brussels
that Washington might commit ground forces to help make up the total.
Russia, however, indicated it would not be sending significant forces since
it was 'over-extended' with peacekeeping operations in the former Soviet
Union. Nato officials, expressing surprise, said Mr Pavel Grachev, Russian
defence minister, had indicated his country would contribute up to 13,000
men.
Meanwhile, a second convoy, carrying food, plastic sheeting and tents, was
waiting to set out for Srebrenica yesterday, but was delayed.
Srebrenica has been under Serb siege for the past 11 months. Its population
of 9,000 has swelled to nearly 60,000 with refugees from the fighting. Many
have died from starvation or shellfire. Suffering chronic shortages of food
and medicine, aid workers in Srebrenica said the population was desperate to
escape.
Diplomats, who believe Srebrenica is the most vulnerable of the few
remaining enclaves in eastern Bosnia, say that despite US air drops the
situation there is still 'very grave'.
Even so, the Bosnian Serb government yesterday protested for 'deep-rooted
historical reasons' to the UNHCR about the use of German military aircraft
to drop relief supplies over eastern Bosnia. Germany sent its first cargo
aircraft to join the US-led mission on Sunday night.
In Zagreb, the Croatian government resigned, against a background of
increasing economic deprivation. Mr Nikica Valentic, head of Ina, Croatia's
state-owned oil company, was named as prime minister.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE king of Belgium has asked his prime minister to seek a solution to the
budget crisis which threatens to bring down the government.
King Baudouin said yesterday he had still not decided whether to accept the
resignation of the centre-left coalition, submitted a week ago. Instead, he
has given Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, prime minister, a 'mission' to mediate
between the four coalition parties - Flemish-speaking and French-speaking
Socialists and Christian Democrats. No deadline has been set.
The coalition split last week when ministers failed to agree how to raise
BFr110bn (Pounds 2.3bn) needed to bring the ballooning Belgian national debt
into line with Maastricht treaty criteria for European economic and monetary
union.
The king's decision, reached after discussions with senior political figures
and advisers, shows he is reluctant to precipitate a new election, less than
two years after the last one.
Mr Dehaene's spokeswoman said the mission would allow the prime minister to
broaden the search for a solution to include talks with leaders of the four
coalition parties as well as with ministers. But she made clear that Mr
Dehaene would not be discussing solutions with opposition.
Belgium's Liberal opposition parties are calling for a fresh election, in
spite of the fact that almost all traditional parties lost votes in the
November 1991 poll. Belgian citizens registered their discontent by voting
for extremists, Greens and anti-political parties.

<TEXT>
ROMANIA'S ethnic Hungarian minority has accused the government of practising
'ethnic purification' within state institutions, following the appointment
of ethnic Romanian prefects in two Transylvanian counties inhabited
predominantly by ethnic Hungarians.
'Hungarians are still considered inferior citizens not able to fulfil posts
of political responsibility,' said the Democratic Union of Magyars in
Romania (DUMR) which represents the country's 1.7m ethnic Hungarians.
The appointment of the prefects to Harghita and Covasna, where more than 75
per cent of the people are ethnic Hungarians, was only the latest example of
continuing discrimination against the minority and contradicted the
government's declared wish for integration into European structures, the
DUMR said.
The government, a left-wing minority which rules with the support of
nationalist and ex-Communist parties, appointed the two prefects last week,
overturning a compromise reached last summer which installed one ethnic
Romanian and one ethnic Hungarian to govern each county jointly. Previously
ethnic Hungarians had held the two posts.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Slovak prime minister, Mr Vladimir Meciar, has emerged stronger within
his own party but more isolated from former political allies after a two-day
conference of his governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS).
The first post-independence congress at Trnava near Bratislava endorsed the
sacking of his foreign and economics ministers and backed Mr Meciar's
ambiguous promise of 'carefully managed and controlled' market reforms.
Mr Meciar was re-elected party chairman with 183 votes against the 41
received by his main rival, Mr Milan Knazko, the ousted foreign minister. He
said the government had no alternative but to carry out sweeping reforms of
the financial and tax systems, public administration, health, education and
the labour market during the next two years.
He gave no details of actual reform proposals but said 'the transformation
(to a market economy) may be achieved in two years. It is an enormous task,
but it will be accomplished.'
Mr Meciar who has seen his rating in opinion polls decline sharply from 34
per cent in January to 25 per cent this month, remains the most powerful
politician in Slovakia. But he badly needs to bolster the image of an
inexperienced government further depleted by the departure of two senior
ministers last week.
Mr Ludovit Cernak, economy minister, resigned citing a series of
disagreements with Mr Meciar, while Mr Knazko, with whom the prime minister
has had bitter public rows, was sacked.
Mr Cernak's departure is the more serious blow at a time of growing
uncertainty about the future of government economic policy and pressure on
the currency. The leader of the Slovak National party, he was also the only
cabinet member not belonging to Mr Meciar's HZDS, which will now have to
assume sole responsibility for the government's actions.

RUSSIA'S President Boris Yeltsin is expected to pronounce today on what he

people and his intention to rule by decree. He has come out of his bitter
conflict with the Congress of People's Deputies in at best an ambiguous
position. Indeed, he has wounded himself as much as he has been hurt by his
opponents.
In seeking both to confront the parliament and to make a deal with it, Mr
Yeltsin and his advisers have risked losing the support of the country's
radicals - support which may be critical when it comes to campaigning for a
pro-Yeltsin vote in a referendum or in future elections.
Much of the damage occurred on Saturday night and Sunday morning. It was
late in the Saturday session of the parliament when Mr Yeltsin took the
microphone and, in a speech which prompted his opponents to accuse him of
drunkenness and his supporters to explain that he was tired and
grief-stricken after the death of his mother, he appeared to beg for
reconciliation, offering a week of talks between himself, Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the
prime minister.
The next morning, Mr Yeltsin confirmed from his position perched above Mr
Khasbulatov that he would immediately drop his idea for a referendum if the
parliament voted for a compromise resolution to hold presidential and
parliamentary elections in November. This was opposed: but the damage to his
veracity was considerable.
Mr Yeltsin had fulfilled the publicly-stated fears of some of the radical
democrats, led by Mr Yuri Afanasiev, the historian, before the parliament
met. In a statement, Mr Afanasiev and his colleagues said that while they
continued to support the president, they feared he would use his principled
position on a referendum as a 'bargaining chip' in yet another bad
compromise with the parliament.
These fears, after the president's proffered compromise, were picked up and
amplified (to the large rally in his support which gathered beside St
Basil's Cathedral outside the Kremlin walls) by Mrs Elena Bonner, widow of
the late Andrei Sakharov, who was the first to speak.
'The president's speech (the previous evening) made me bitterly
disappointed,' she said. 'I have, do and will support the president, but he
must be our president. I wanted him to say: we must continue the economic
reforms; I wanted him to say: we will go by the voice of the people, we will
have a referendum, and we won't allow any compromises.'
It was for these reasons that Mr Khasbulatov, who himself survived a
challenge to his post, was at least partly right when yesterday he claimed
triumph after four days of an ebb and flow of political fortunes.

RUSSIA'S defence minister, Mr Pavel Grachev, yesterday reaffirmed that the
army would stay out of the power struggle in Moscow, but he faced sharp
criticism from Nato over the decision to stop troop withdrawals from the
Baltic states, Reuter reports from Brussels.
Mr Grachev, attending a meeting of defence ministers from Nato, eastern
Europe and the former Soviet Union, said the army would be the 'guarantor of
stability' in the current crisis. 'My instruction to the army to stay out of
politics reached every soldier,' he told Italian television in an interview.
However, he drew an angry reaction from Nato allies - including the US,
Britain, Canada and Norway - when he told the meeting that a decision to
suspend troop withdrawals from the Baltic states was still in force.
Mr Grachev said there had been no agreement between Russian authorities,
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia on the pace of withdrawal and that it had
proved difficult to find housing for thousands of troops that were stationed
in the republics.
Mr Manfred Worner, Nato secretary-general, said there was understanding for
Russia's problems over what he called a 'temporary suspension' and that some
countries - including the Baltics - had offered help with housing. But he
added: 'There is no doubt that the position of Nato remains firm on the
principle. . . . that you should not station troops on the territory of a
sovereign state without its consent.'

parliament brings fringe benefits no one gives up lightly

<TEXT>
MR VLADIMIR ISAKOV is no average deputy. He is an important political figure
in the Russian parliament, the guiding intelligence behind the Russian Unity
bloc (generally known as 'hardline').
In the details of his election and political development since then and in
the conditions of his work - his pay, benefits and privileges - lie some of
the reasons for the reluctance of many deputies to give up their seats in
parliament.
It explains why, yesterday, deputies voted to include a question on their
re-election ina referendum set for April 25 - but gave no date, hoping to be
able to keep their seats for as long as possible.
Mr Isakov, 43, was elected from the city of Ekaterinburg, which was called
Sverdlovsk when he was elected, and was the home base of Mr Yeltsin when he
was a district Communist party secretary.
Now one of the Russian president's bitterest critics, Mr Isakov was then a
keen, even fervent, member of Democratic Russia, a pro-Yeltsin reform
grouping.
His journey across the political spectrum to Russian Unity has been further
than most have cared to go, but it is far from unique. Mr Yeltsin had a
majority in this parliament: present voting shows his support to be
somewhere between one quarter and one third.
As one of the 245 deputies who serve in the small, permanent Supreme Soviet,
he qualifies for a range of - in Russian terms - impressive benefits.
He receives a monthly salary of Rbs40,000 (around Dollars 60 at the present
exchange rate), more than twice the average wage; he also gets Rbs46,000 a
month to pay for secretarial or other assistance.
He has an office in the 'White House', or Russian parliament; a pleasant
flat in Moscow for free; a dacha in one of the 17 dacha settlements or
sanatoriums owned by the Russian parliament.
He does not pay for any travel within Russia, and he can always get a seat
on Aeroflot aircraft: at nearly all airports except the smallest, there is a
'deputies' hall', usually an oasis of peace in a surrounding of noise and
squalor.
All of this, plus influence, prominence, and offers of foreign trips, make
Mr Isakov's job highly desirable. For his colleagues who are members only of
the larger Congress, the benefits are much less. They receive Rbs6,000 a
month, plus Rbs23,000 for assistance and free travel in Russia: it is
assumed they will keep their regular jobs.
Although many of these deputies have turned into effective local
representatives, Mr Isakov said yesterday, however, that 'they are now tired
of being insulted by their constituents, who think the hard life they're
suffering is all their fault'.
Mr Isakov freely admits that the good life offered to deputies, many of whom
had modest means before, constitutes a 'severe problem for our movement'.
Though it supports extraordinary elections for both the presidency and the
deputies the Russian Unity group has, he says, a number of deputies who 'try
to find any rationalisation, any argument, to cover the fact that they do't
want to lose what they have gained. They must understand this is a moral
position which they must take,' he says.
However, he admits he is luckier than most. A lawyer by profession, and a
lecturer at the Sverdlovsk Law Institute before he was elected in 1990, he
says he has a good job to which to return. But 'I can only feel pity for
those who have to return to find a job in the economy they themselves
destroyed'.
Like nearly all of the deputies, Mr Isakov was selected in 1990 for a
four-year term. He was also elected fairly freely - a fact which, when
ignored by the president's side and by foreign press and governments, makes
him and his colleagues angry.
The March 4, 1990, elections to the Congress of People's Deputies saw 6,700
candidates fight for 1,068 seats in total, an average of six candidates for
each seat.
The justification for calling the parliament 'Communist-dominated' is that
more than 80 per cent of those contesting the seats were members of the
Communist party.
However, they also often represented the emerging political and social
movements of the time - like the anti-Stalinist Memorial society - and many
of the successful candidates, like Mr Yeltsin himself, were liberal
Communists running against party apparatchiks.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Hurd urges western states to stick by Russia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER, Diplomatic Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S Foreign Secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, yesterday made a ringing
declaration of support for President Boris Yeltsin, emphasising that the
whole process of reform in Russia was associated with his name.
Referring to Mr Yeltsin's 'courageous economic and democratic programme' Mr
Hurd said in an address to the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Bonn that the
present crisis in Russia would probably not be the last it would face in its
adaptation to a new economic and political system. However, 'if Russia gets
through this drama, it will have secured one more stage in the process of
renewal'.
In spite of the difficulties that undoubtedly lay ahead, the west must not
give up on Russia, which was 'part of our part of the world', Mr Hurd told
members of the leading German Christian Democratic think-tank. 'We shall
help not out of sentimentality, not out of hero worship. We shall help based
on an assessment of our interests.'
Mr Hurd urged Mr Yeltsin to resist the temptation of putting political
reforms on the back-burner while concentrating on the problems of the
economy. Economic and political liberalisation went hand-in-hand.
'If you teach an individual to think and care about costs, profits and the
free market, you cannot indefinitely prevent him or her from thinking about
elections, changes of government and a free press.'
Calling for a new trading relationship with Russia, Mr Hurd said that open
markets were the best way of helping the country. The European Community
should be be generous and open its markets to Russian goods. The long-term
aim should be to create a free trade area between the Community and Russia.
Mr Hurd also praised Russia's co-operative attitude in the United Nations
and said the western nations should show their support for its new foreign
policy. If a peace agreement was reached on Bosnia, it would owe much to the
Russians. 'Their consistent pressure on the Serbs will help bring about a
settlement.'

FT  30 MAR 93 / Milestone nears along road to political renewal: Italy's
voting system is among the constitutional reforms tackled in next month's
referendums
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS a gentle reminder to the Italian electorate of the complexity of
politics, the ministry of the interior is printing 600m voting slips for the
country's next appointment with the ballot box. On April 18, Italians are
being asked to vote for no fewer than 10 separate referendums.
All these referendums touch on reforms of the existing structure of state;
but by far the most important concerns changes in the existing system of
proportional representation that has been responsible for 51 unstable
post-war coalitions.
The outcome will determine not only the life of the present government of Mr
Giuliano Amato, the prime minister, but also the timing of early elections
and the shape of new political alliances. In short April 18 will be a
milestone in the path Italy is treading to renew its ossified political
system and come to terms with the extraordinary situation created by the
ever increasing series of corruption scandals.
The referendums themselves are a direct reflection of a fractious
parliament's inability to agree on the necessary constitutional reforms. The
initiative has been taken up by a mixture of civic pressure groups and
parliamentarians who have decided to force reform upon the legislature
through a popular vote. Their efforts have overtaken the slow-moving joint
parliamentary commission on constitutional reform which still has not agreed
on concrete proposals.
Most notable among those in the 'Referendum Movement' is Mr Mario Segni, the
son of a former Italian president who last night announced he was breaking
with the Christian Democrat party. In June 1991, he saw his first referendum
initiative overwhelmingly endorsed - the abolition of multi-preference
voting, and the establishment of a single preference vote which limited the
ability of the party bosses to manipulate support for their favoured
candidates in the election a year ago.
Mr Segni is proposing to introduce a first-past-the-post system for 238 of
the 315 seats in the Senate, with the proportional system retained for the
remainder. Although the more important chamber of deputies is excluded, by
implication the reform is likely to cover it. The constitutional reform
commission has accepted in principle the idea of a majority voting system,
and the main debate is whether to adopt a UK-style single round or a French
run-off. In this respect the defeat of the Socialists in France could force
a significant re-think on the idea of a second round - or indeed on having
up to 65 per cent of the lower house elected by a majority system. Mr Segni
remains ambiguous on this.
The two other important referendums are for the abolition of state funding
of political parties - illicit funding is a central issue in the current
corruption scandals - and direct election of mayors. Taken together these
three referendums would create greater political transparency,
accountability and individual voter choice at the expense of corrupt party
machines. Parliament is close to agreeing a law on direct election of mayors
and one on party finance is also under discussion.
Three weeks ago President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro refused to sign the latter in
the form of a decree because the legislation extended an effective amnesty
to those caught up in corruption probes.
One referendum abolishing the ministry of state shareholdings has been
overtaken by events: the ministry no longer exists. Another of the 10
referendums, abolishing special aid to the Mezzogiorno (the south), is set
to be headed off as the issue of regional assistance is being recast. Two
further referendums want to abolish the ministries of agriculture and
tourism, transferring their authority to the regions. Three more -
depenalising use of drugs, removing environmental matters from local health
authorities and ending political appointment of savings banks boards - would
have limited impact. A convincing mandate to implement these reforms means a
vote of more than 60 per cent in favour, although this cannot be taken for
granted.

please three masters

   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Edouard Balladur, who last night was chosen as France's new prime
minister, faces a delicate balancing act.
His first job will be to choose a ministerial team that gives fair division
of spoils between his own Gaullist RPR, the larger member of the ruling
coalition, and the centre-right UDF.
Here he will have to satisfy both party chiefs as well as the Socialist
president, Mr Francois Mitterrand. He interfered closely with the selection
of ministers in the previous right-wing government, and will probably do so
again.
That done, much of Mr Balladur's time will be devoted to keeping discipline
in the RPR, whose internal splits on the European Community and monetary
union are likely to open again now that the election is over.
President Mitterrand chose Mr Balladur, 63, partly for his qualifications as
the man who drew up the policy of delicate cohabitation followed by the
1986-1988 right-wing government, in which he was finance minister. The fact
that recent polls made him the most popular prime ministerial candidate by a
long way, also counts.
For the right, he is a suitable candidate because he has no presidential
ambitions, so leaving that field clear for the RPR's leader Mr Jacques
Chirac and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF. Mr Mitterrand
found him acceptable because of Mr Balladur's natural good manners, because
he does not want to lever Mr Mitterrand out of the Elysee - unlike Mr Chirac
 -and because he is pro-European, a key criterion laid down by Mr
Mitterrand.
Does Mr Balladur have the qualities needed to steer this tricky course? He
is a moderate, pragmatic Gaullist, in line with his mentor, former president
Georges Pompidou, and so will avoid dogmatic battles. Another strong point
is the authority he gains as the mastermind of the last right-wing
government's privatisation programme, one of its few successes. Mr Balladur
promises another round of state sell offs.

<TEXT>
Mr Mario Segni, leader of the 'Referendum Movement', yesterday ended months
of speculation about his position inside the Christian Democrat party when
he announced a clean break. His move is likely to have an important impact
on the future composition of the party and its electoral support, writes
Robert Graham. It could prove the first move in a more general political
realignment. Mr Segni, aged 53, is one of the few politicians still with a
strong rating in the opinion polls and has represented a vital clean image
for the party. His decision has been directly prompted by the weekend news
that senior members of the party, including Mr Giulio Andreotti, the former
prime minister, were under investigation for alleged links with the Mafia.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Italian spotlight on links to Mafia
</HEADLINE>

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CORRUPTION scandals in Italy have reached a new and potentially far more
explosive phase as magistrates focus on the inner workings of the Christian
Democrat party and its control over the levers of power.
Until now magistrates investigating corruption have attacked the outer core
of the political system. Over the past year they have revealed a system of
bribes and favours in which politicians received funds for themselves and
their parties in return for awarding contracts and cartels to businessmen.
In revealing this system, which got out of hand in the 1980s, the Christian
Democrats and Socialists have been damaged and patronage politics has been
discredited.
But in the magistrates' warning to Mr Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime
minister, that he is being investigated for allegedly consorting with the
Sicilian Mafia, and in conducting the same investigative process against the
Christian Democrats' top two bosses in Naples, matters have changed
radically. Mr Andreotti has insisted on his innocence as have Mr Paolo
Cirino Pomicino and Mr Antonio Gava, the Naples Christian Democrat leaders.
But the process will be hard to stop.
This involves a challenge to the Christian Democrats' near-exclusive hold
over the apparatus of state since 1946. The party has undoubtedly been
supported by a popular vote and been backed by the Church. But it has also
sustained itself in power through control over the security services (the
Interior Ministry has never left Christian Democrat hands), manipulation of
the courts and unchallenged use of state funds. Italy has had a long list of
mysterious events which have never been clarified for the simple reason that
the truth would discredit or even bring down the Christian Democrat
hierarchy.
The events include the 'execution' of Mr Aldo Moro, the Christian Democrat
prime minister, at the hands of the Red Brigades; the murder of police chief
Carlo Alberto della Chiesa; the collapse of the Sindona financial empire;
the death of banker Roberto Calvi; the role of the secret masonic lodge P2;
the abortive coup of Valerio Borghese and a series of bombings including a
disaster at Bologna railway station.
The common link in all is either the suspected presence of the Mafia or the
secret services - or both.
Mr Andreotti, who has held every office of state save the presidency, has
been in power throughout these events. In defending himself now, he may well
be obliged to shed some light on them.
Equally, politicians may well have to explain how it is that the Mafia in
Sicily and its counterparts in Calabria and Naples have expanded in recent
years.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: Chirac gambles on
leading from behind - RPR leader's latest move in a strategy for winning the
presidency in 1995
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE smile says it all. Try as he might to adopt the insouciant air of a
potential president, Mr Jacques Chirac yesterday failed dismally to disguise
his glee at the conservatives' success in Sunday's elections.
Mr Chirac, 60, has every reason to be gleeful. Not only has the conservative
coalition won the biggest majority of any French government since the early
19th century, but his own RPR party emerged as the largest parliamentary
faction with 247 seats, against 213 for the UDF, its coalition partner. This
means that the RPR should not only have a strong claim over key cabinet
posts, but should also be able to exert considerable influence on the
policies of France's new cohabitation government.
The RPR has been here before. It was also the largest party in the last
cohabitation government from 1986 to 1988 making Mr Chirac, as its leader,
the natural choice for prime minister. Mr Chirac then spent two gruelling
years being upstaged by President Francois Mitterrand and, convinced that
this cost him the 1988 presidential election, he has refused to stand as
cohabitation prime minister again.
Mr Chirac is gambling that his chances of winning the 1995 presidential poll
will be better if he spends the next two years as mayor of Paris, rather
than fencing with Mr Mitterrand. He may be wrong. His humiliations at the
hands of Mr Mitterrand undoubtedly did contribute to his 1988 defeat, but Mr
Chirac was also dogged by the electorate's lingering doubts.
He is seen as too ambitious for his own good, a problem which may be
aggravated by his tactics. In the meantime, RPR leader faces the challenge
of striking a balance between adopting a low profile, thereby avoiding the
blame for any mistakes made by the new government, and having such a low
profile that he jeopardises his present success in the presidential opinion
polls.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: French majority is
opposition too
</HEADLINE>

   By DAVID BUCHAN

<TEXT>
SO LARGE is France's conservative majority that it threatens to provide the
country with both its government and its effective opposition.
That is the private fear behind the public calls for unity-in-victory by Mr
Jacques Chirac and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, respectively the leaders of
the RPR Gaullists and centre-right UDF.
Mathematically, the conservative majority can withstand some centrifugal
tendences without endangering the new government's life. The RPR now has 247
seats, the UDF 213 and there are 24 independent right-wingers in the
National Assembly. Some of the latter will join one or other group. The
National Front's loss of its one deputy removes the only potential thorn in
the government's right flank from outside.
In all, the centre-right will have 484 deputies nominally in its camp when
the new parliament opens on Friday, nearly 200 more than it needs for an
absolute majority.
That is precisely the problem. There is no prospect of a parliamentary
defeat to keep the majority in line, while there is no shortage of issues on
which it can divide - uncomfortably high interest rates, unpalatable
spending cuts, policy on Europe, and even the position of President Francois
Mitterrand himself.
The factiousness is greatest inside the UDF, which for convenience is
usually described as a single party when it is in fact a federation of five
parties. Sunday's vote was a sweet and sour experience for Mr Giscard
d'Estaing. Sweet, because never before had the UDF gone over the 200-seat
mark in its 15-year history. Sour, because the RPR did even better, thereby
dashing Mr Giscard d'Estaing's openly-expressed hope that the UDF would
match the RPR and so shake the latter's image as the senior partner in
French conservative politics.
If the UDF had beaten the RPR in seats and provided the new prime minister
from within its ranks, the perquisites of power would have probably been
enough to weld it into a single parliamentary party.
As it is, Mr Giscard d'Estaing yesterday reluctantly had to endorse Mr
Edouard Balladur, the RPR dauphin, as the natural candidate for prime
minister. Today the UDF leader faces the difficult task of trying to
persuade the disparate factions which make up the federation's 213 new
deputies to function as one group in the Palais Bourbon, the classical
structure which houses the national assembly.
In the last parliament, the CDS centrists had their own whip and operated as
a separate group. Now that they have gained an extra 10 seats, pushing their
strength up to 60, it will be hard to dissuade the CDS to abandon its
relative autonomy. If the CDS stays separate, the UDF's largest member, the
Republican party - which has seen its strength nearly double from 58 to 106
deputies - may also break away.
But on key economic and foreign issues, the RPR has deeper policy fissures
than the UDF, even though administratively it functions as a single machine.
The mischievous Mr Philippe Seguin, one of the leading Gaullist campaigners
against Maastricht, underlined this yesterday, saying he planned to
'contribute as much as possible to the diversity' of the new government
majority. So, the new majority may prove a more effective opposition to its
own government than the much-depleted Socialists.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Rome cools expectations of state group changes
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Italian government yesterday damped expectations of imminent boardroom
changes at the country's biggest state-owned companies, despite the weekend
appointment of a new board at the Eni energy and chemicals concern.
Mr Piero Barucci, the Treasury minister, said further appointments would
only come ahead of shareholders' meetings at Iri, the biggest state holding
company, the Ina insurance concern and Enel, the electricity generating
authority. However, he gave no indication of when these meetings would take
place. Businessmen have been keenly awaiting details of the new boards.
Their size and composition will be important indicators of the determination
of the government to prepare for privatisation and reduce political
influence on the state sector.
The boards were slimmed down to three members last year when all four state
groups were transformed by the Amato government into joint stock companies
as the first step towards privatisation. However, the mini-boards,
comprising a managing director and senior civil servants, were seen as
temporary pending the appointment of bigger boards including senior company
executives and outside specialists.
It is widely expected that Mr Franco Nobili, Iri's chairman, who has been
told by magistrates he is under investigation in the country's political
corruption scandal, will be replaced. Less clear are the positions of Mr
Lorenzo Pallesi, Ina's chairman, and Mr Franco Viezzoli, the chairman of
Enel.
On Saturday, the government named Mr Luigi Meanti, a former managing
director of Eni's Snam natural gas subsidiary, as its new chairman. Mr
Franco Bernabe remains as managing director, while the four others nominated
included a senior academic and the chairman of IBM's Italian subsidiary.
However, last night the latter, Mr Renato Riverso, said he was unable to
accept because of current commitments.
The changes at Eni followed this month's arrest of Mr Gabriele Cagliari, its
former chairman, and the chairmen of four leading subsidiaries. Though some
of those arrested have since been released, Mr Cagliari is still being held
in Milan's San Vittore prison on allegations of illegal political funding.
The new appointments at Eni, to be confirmed by a shareholders' meeting this
week, will be mirrored by similar changes at its subsidiaries, which include
the EniChem chemicals concern, the Agip petroleum group and Snam.
Their sizeable boards, sometimes comprising a chairman, deputy and up to
three managing directors, are likely to be replaced by six-member bodies.
The number of managing directors is likely to be reduced to one, or at most
two, individuals, while political appointees will be excluded.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Assemblee Nationale, Elections '93: Delors is victor in
Socialist defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors has always claimed that his main advantage over his rivals
in French politics is that, as president of the European Commission in
Brussels, he has the bonus of distance from the domestic fray.
This theory was certainly borne out by the results of the French
parliamentary elections in which the Socialist party suffered devastating
defeat and Mr Delors benefited from a sudden surge in the opinion polls as
the favourite Socialist candidate for the 1995 presidential poll.
The Socialist party, dogged by a barrage of gloomy economic news and string
of scandals, had long been resigned to losing the election. However, the
result was not only worse than they had expected, but dealt serious damage
to their hopes of relaunching the French left in a 'big bang' alliance of
the Socialist party and ecologists mooted by Mr Michel Rocard, former prime
minister and one of Mr Delors' chief competitors for the presidential
ticket.
When Mr Rocard floated his 'big bang' proposals in February, the Socialist
party and ecologists commanded enough support to stand a reasonable chance
of ousting the right. The ecologists have since lost ground and did not win
a single seat in Sunday's vote.
The Socialists emerged with just 54 seats, against 252 in the last
parliament. This means that, if it was not for the support of the motley
assortment of allies who won 16 seats, the Socialist camp would not even
have the minimum 58 seats needed to table motions of censure against the
conservative government.
Moreover, Mr Rocard lost his seat at Conflans-Sainte-Honorine outside Paris,
thereby imperilling his hopes, not only of implementing the 'big bang' but
also of running for president.
Mr Laurent Fabius, the other presidential hopeful, is handicapped by his
role as first secretary of the Socialist party and by his closeness to the
increasingly isolated President Francois Mitterrand.
This leaves Mr Delors to watch from the sidelines in Brussels, more
appreciative than ever of his 'bonus'.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Britain and France seek end to fishing rights row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN and France yesterday moved to prevent a diplomatic row from
developing over weekend incidents involving French fishermen and Royal Navy
patrol vessels.
The moves came as further confrontation between fishermen appeared to have
been defused when 40 French boats left the Guernsey capital, St Peter Port.
After discussions with the Guernsey Sea Fisheries Committee and Guernsey
fishermen, French skippers agreed to a four-week cooling off period in which
to try to resolve problems over disputed fishing grounds off the Channel
island.
Earlier, officials in both countries had called for calm. Mr David Curry, UK
fisheries minister, played down earlier statements suggesting Britain might
use force. The government would be 'hysterically over-reacting' if it
changed its fisheries protection policy which precludes the use of firepower
against unarmed fishermen, he said.
'I believe the French fishermen have been trying to take advantage of the
transition between governments. They are trying it on. It is important not
to confuse this with a more generalised EC dispute over fisheries,' Mr Curry
said, following talks with Mr Archie Hamilton, UK defence minister.
Mr Bernard Dorin, French ambassador in London, said a meeting with foreign
office minister, Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, was 'very cordial and friendly'.
In a prepared statement, which had the apparent blessing of British
officials, Mr Dorin said: 'The French government has condemned the
fishermen's unacceptable behaviour in this matter . . . the French
authorities will do everything necessary to ensure that such incidents are
not repeated.'
Meanwhile, Mr John Gummer, minister for agriculture and fisheries, repeated
a warning that the UK would consider arming its naval boarding parties if
French actions escalated.
However, British officials stressed last night that they were dissuaded from
altering the rules by the risk that this might exacerbate the relatively
minor incidents when animosity between fishermen on both sides was high.
On Sunday, three Royal Navy fisheries protection officers were abducted
after boarding a French trawler off the Channel Islands.
The events have come at a sensitive time for France, which is changing
government following the electoral success of the conservative coalition.
The outgoing Socialist government was supportive of French fishermen, who
have been protesting against cheap fish imports, while at the same time
condemning attacks by French fishing vessels.
The RPR Gaullists, the largest conservative party, have been more
chauvinistic than the outgoing Socialists at defending French interests,
although UK officials are confident that they are unlikely to risk
Anglo-French relations.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Balladur named French PM after Socialist election rout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Francois Mitterrand last night named Mr Edouard Balladur as
France's new prime minister after the centre-right swept the Socialists out
of power by winning 484 of the 577 seats in the new parliament.
Mr Balladur said he planned to form a small, tightly-knit cabinet dedicated
to 'setting our country to rights' and restoring confidence. 'Our country is
in crisis,' he said. 'All our efforts must be mobilised to overcome it.'
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister under the defeated Socialists, handed in
his resignation earlier in the day.
Mr Mitterrand said he had chosen Mr Balladur, a former Gaullist finance
minister, 'not only because he is the most suitable to bring together the
different components of the new (government) majority, but also because of
his competence.'
Mr Mitterrand started a brief television address by telling his countrymen
that: 'By your vote, you have clearly marked your desire for a new policy,'
adding: 'I will scrupulously respect this.'
However, the 76-year-old president - whose term runs until 1995 if his
health permits - signalled that he intended to exercise his constitutional
right to influence foreign and defence policy. He underlined the importance
to France of European integration, the implementation of the Maastricht
treaty and the linking of the franc to the D-Mark as a step to European
monetary union.
The president has a free hand in selecting a prime minister. But after the
landslide victory for RPR Gaullists and centre-right UDF parties, he seemed
to have little choice but to fall in with their preference for Mr Balladur.
The odds on Mr Balladur getting the top government job had shortened further
yesterday when he won endorsement from the UDF.
Its leader, Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, said that, after the RPR had
outdistanced his party by winning 247 seats against 213 for the UDF, it was
natural the premiership should go to someone from the RPR.
In return, Mr Giscard d'Estaing said the RPR should leave the UDF to provide
the president of the new National Assembly, which opens on Friday. The job
of finance minister is also considered likely to go to a UDF member. Among
names being mentioned as possible candidates are Mr Pierre Mehaignerie and
Mr Edmond Alphandery.
Both Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader, and Mr Giscard d'Estaing had
indicated before last night's announcement that they would stay out of the
government. Each has an interest in keepinghis hands free to run for the
presidency to succeed Mr Mitterrand.
Most French apparently believe Mr Mitterrand should ignore calls by RPR
leaders, including Mr Chirac, for him to resign early in spite of the margin
of the conservative parties' election triumph.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Three-week deadline set for US-EC trade pact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday withdrew the immediate threat of trade sanctions against
the European Community in its row over EC public purchasing policies. The
decision followed a three-hour meeting in Brussels between senior trade
negotiators.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, said after the talks that the
two sides would aim to settle differences by the time he next meets Mr
Mickey Kantor, his US counterpart, in Washington on April 19. If agreement
is not reached by then, both sides will be 'free to act as we wish'.
The Community has outlined a package of new proposals on public procurement,
which Sir Leon said met EC concerns about the US market and vice versa. The
two said they had agreed not to reveal details of the package.
At the end of what appeared to have been difficult talks, Mr Kantor insisted
he was 'neither an optimist, nor a pessimist, but a realist' over the
prospect of averting the clash on EC procurement rules. 'On first reading,
there is not complete agreement. Some of it may not be in our interest. We
have work to do.'
He said he 'was pleased that a constructive proposal was put on the table',
but added: 'We may not be able to reach an agreement.'
An EC official expressed satisfaction that the immediate prospect of
conflict had been averted, noting that this would have complicated
negotiations both on procurement and on wider international negotiations on
trade reform under the Uruguay Round. He nevertheless conceded that the
April 19-20 deadline for agreement would create intense pressure on
negotiators.
Mr Kantor said later: 'If we cannot get this done in the next three weeks,
then of course . . . the US will be forced to invoke sanctions.'
At the heart of the dispute is US anger at a new EC Utilities Directive,
which opens up the EC procurement market to foreign bidders, but allows EC
authorities to favour EC bidders so long as they are no more than 3 per cent
more expensive than foreign competitors.
Sir Leon said yesterday he had agreed to make preparations to dismantle the
offending article giving preference to EC bidders, so that it could be
removed rapidly in the event of agreement on April 19. He said the EC
proposals were 'recognised by the US as being promising, but require a
considerable degree of further exploration and discussion'.
EC negotiators remain adamant that the US must remove discrimination in the
way US state and municipal governments award procurement contracts if the
EC's 3 per cent preference is to be discarded. Mr Kantor said that amendment
of the offending article would not be acceptable.
As a measure of the gulf still to be bridged by negotiators, Mr Kantor later
insisted the Buy America Act 'has had no effect on European suppliers'.
On wider bilateral trade negotiations, he said tariff cuts had been
discussed that would be 'much larger than has been discussed in the past,
both in terms of the sectors and in terms of the reductions of tariffs
involved'.

FT  30 MAR 93 / Government wins backing on pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN, MICHAEL SMITH and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government comfortably headed off a threatened backbench rebellion over
its coal white paper last night, leaving it free to implement proposals to
reprieve 12 of the 31 threatened pits.
The 319 votes to 297 victory - a government majority of 22 - removed any
question mark over the political career of Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade
and industry secretary.
A Labour amendment calling for domestic coal production to be maintained at
present volumes was earlier defeated by 320 votes to 295.
In both cases, the government's majority was bolstered by the support or
abstentions of the nine Ulster Unionist MPs who last week won at least
Pounds 10m extra help from the Northern Ireland Office for industrial
electricity users in the province.
Four Conservatives - Mr Bill Cash (Stafford), Mr Richard Alexander (Newark),
Mrs Elizabeth Peacock (Batley and Spen) and Mr Nicholas Winterton
(Macclesfield) - voted against the government motion. Another 16 did not
vote, of whom three - Mr Steven Day (Cheadle), Mr Patrick Cormack
(Staffordshire South), and Mr Winston Churchill (Davyhulme) - were believed
deliberately to have abstained.
These figures compared with six votes against and five abstentions when MPs
debated the government's original pit closure programme last October.
In a sometimes stormy debate, Mr Heseltine used the promise of 'hundreds of
millions of pounds' in subsidies to the coal industry to keep the backbench
revolt below danger levels.
There was 'a significant new market to go for', he told a sceptical Commons.
'We have made it clear that the best hope for British Coal is to take
advantage of the opportunity we have provided.'
But a series of interventions by possible rebels indicated that he had not
completely calmed fears that the 12 reprieved pits might not survive for
more than a year.
These fears were played on by Mr Robin Cook, shadow trade and industry
secretary, in a spirited plea to Tory MPs to join Labour in voting down the
white paper.
Today was the day for Tories who had voiced displeasure at the original pit
closure announcement last October to make good the promises they had made
five months ago to Britain's mining communities, Mr Cook argued.
The debate came as the coal and electricity industries completed signing
contracts for the sale of 160m tonnes of coal over five years, leaving the
way clear for talks on extra sales aimed at saving the 12 reprieved pits.
British Coal yesterday joined Mr Heseltine in admitting it could not
forecast how big the extra market would be above the core contract. 'The
generators and rest of electricity industry will effectively decide the
future for our pits,' the company said.

<TEXT>
MORE than 2,000 miners and their supporters, including nuclear power
workers, rallied in central London yesterday to protest at the Coal White
Paper, followed by a lobby of parliament, writes Lisa Wood.
Mr Simon Hughes, the Liberal Democrat MP, joined forces with Mr Arthur
Scargill, the NUM leader, to call on workers throughout the country to take
industrial action to halt the pit closures.
Mr Frank Dobson, Labour's employment spokesman and Mr Norman Willis, general
secretary of the TUC, were both booed by sections of the crowd - who called
upon the Labour party and the TUC to play a more prominent leadership role
in the dispute.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The New Statesman and Society magazine paid libel damages to Lord Tebbit
yesterday, for repeating an allegation that he had once said 'nobody with a
conscience votes Conservative'. Lord Tebbit had always vigorously denied
making the statement and had received 'substantial' damages over the
original libel.
The magazine apologised in open court for the annoyance and embarrassment
caused to Lord Tebbit, agreed to pay damages and legal costs and undertook
never to repeat the allegation.

FT  29 MAR 93 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the motor and business services group, is expected to report
substantially increased pre-tax profits, from Pounds 185m to about Pounds
248m, when its 1992 results are published today. Interest will focus on how
the group has integrated Tozer Kemsley Millbourn, the motors and retailing
concern bought for Pounds 383m at the end of 1991, and which is thought to
have enhanced earnings.
Analysts will also want to hear how Toyota and Mazda vehicles are faring,
now the car market is at last showing signs of recovery.
Interims, also today, from Lucas Industries, one of the largest UK
engineering groups, will provide few surprises.
The group has already made clear its 1992-93 first half will be little
better than the previous year when it made pre-tax profits of Pounds
200,000. But it is expecting to earn enough over the full year to pay a
maintained covered dividend of 7p, pointing to total pre-tax profits of
around Pounds 75m.
Pearson, the diversified group which includes the Financial Times in its
range of interests, is forecast to show a fall in 1992 profits when it
announces today.
Analysts are looking for around Pounds 140m-Pounds 146m, compared to Pounds
173.8m the year before. However, a maintained dividend is expected. Low
activity in the US oil industry will have hit Camco, while recession will
have taken its toll at Royal Doulton and the entertainments divisions.
Construction company Taylor Woodrow is expected to reveal pre-tax losses for
last year of Pounds 65m to Pounds 70m when it announces results tomorrow.
Analysts are expecting more than Pounds 60m of write downs to bring the
company's land bank and properties into line with current market levels.
After cutting its dividend at the interim stage, the final is also likely to
be cut, possibly to 0.5p compared to 7.64p last year.
Analysts following Burmah Castrol believe the lubricants, chemicals and
fuels group will on Thursday report annual profits ranging from Pounds
82m-Pounds 86m, compared with Pounds 79m in 1991.
The uncertainty arises because concern over the group's exposure to the
faltering German economy, increased by its acquisition of the Foseco
metallurgical business, is balanced by prospects for synthetic oil products
in the US.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Risk and Reward: Questions over growth of banks' off-balance
sheet exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE over-the-counter derivatives markets may continue to expand but the
off-balance sheet credit exposure of banks involved in them has ceased to
grow.
If anything, off-balance sheet risks shrank last year. That is the
conclusion to be drawn from the recent accounts of three of the largest US
commercial banks.
Citibank, Bankers Trust and JP Morgan are among the half-dozen or so of the
biggest US banks in the over-the-counter markets, alongside Chemical,
BankAmerica and Chase Manhattan. Notes to their 1992 accounts show the pace
at which their derivative portfolios are growing, but in a way that is not
adding to their real exposures - at least, according to the banks' own
measurement of those risks.
Between them, the three banks were involved in interest-rate related
derivatives with a notional value of over Dollars 2,000bn at the end of
1992, up from under Dollars 1,500 a year before. However, the implicit
credit risk in these instruments actually fell, from Dollars 26.1bn to
Dollars 22.9bn.
The reason? The amount at risk is not directly related to the scale of the
contracts, but to the extent to which each contract is showing a gain. In
other words, if a counterparty stopped paying, say, the fixed-rate leg of an
interest swap agreement, the scale of the loss would depend on how
profitable the swap has become to the bank.
If the payments were at 6 per cent, compared with a market interest rate of
5 per cent, then the bank would face a cost from the lost income stream.
That lost income, discounted back to present value, is the replacement cost
of the contract. The static or falling credit exposure of the banks last
year suggests that the income they are receiving on the average interest
rate contract is closer to market levels than a year before. In volatile
markets, these credit figures could rise or fall sharply as the gain on
particular contracts rises or falls.
According to a recent joint report from the US Federal Reserve, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation and Office of Comptroller of the Currency,
most of these risks are concentrated in a small number of large financial
institutions which have sophisticated ways of measuring and controlling
their derivatives exposures. Their report - Derivative Product Activities of
Commercial Banks - raises none of the concerns over the growth of the
derivative markets seen in some official quarters.
A similar picture - of rising trading volumes but static credit risk -
emerges from foreign exchange-related derivatives. The three banks added
about Dollars 400bn of exchange-related derivatives in terms of notional
value, taking the total to Dollars 1,800bn at the end of 1992. The credit
risks associated with these contracts edged down to Dollars 40bn.
Taking the banks as a group, the growth in volume, by about a third, was
consistent across most of the different exchange and interest rate products
 -swaps, options, futures and forwards. However, there were sharp
differences between the banks in terms of which instruments each had been
most active in:
The notional value of JP Morgan's interest rate swap portfolio jumped to
Dollars 368bn at the end of 1992 from Dollars 250bn a year before.
Options were the fastest-growing interest rate product, with the outstanding
amounts jumping to Dollars 570bn from Dollars 330bn. Also, Bankers Trust's
involvement in interest rate futures and forward contracts soared to Dollars
246bn from Dollars 75bn.
In keeping with its strong position in foreign exchange, Citibank's
outstanding forward contracts and futures in the exchange markets leapt by
Dollars 200bn to nearly Dollars 800bn.
The growth of equity and commodity derivatives was confirmed by JP Morgan's
disclosure that outstanding notional amounts in these markets had risen to
Dollars 38.8bn from Dollars 18.3bn. Bankers Trust, though, reported that the
notional value of 'other contracts' (mainly equity and equity index options)
had fallen to Dollars 29bn from Dollars 58bn.
At least some of these amounts will start to appear on US bank balance
sheets from next year, following a Financial Accounting Standards Board
ruling. According to Bankers Trust, had the ruling been in force now, it
would have swollen the balance sheet by Dollars 14bn, hitting its ratio of
equity to total assets.

FT  29 MAR 93 / LDP godfather faces more tax evasion charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE prosecutors have filed further tax evasion charges against Mr Shin
Kanemaru, the fallen 'godfather' of the ruling Liberal Democratic party, and
are continuing investigations into allegedly illegal political donations by
leading construction companies.
Having already been charged with evading Y119m (Dollars 983,400) in tax for
1987, Mr Kanemaru was charged at the weekend with having evaded Y920m in
taxes for 1988 and 1989. His former secretary, Mr Masahisa Haibara, was
charged with evading taxes totalling Y280m from 1988 to 1991.
Mr Kanemaru has been in custody since March 6, in contrast to his previously
lenient treatment from prosecutors.
It remains unclear how tough the prosecutors will be in pursuing Japanese
construction companies, but 18 leading contractors have been raided in the
search for information about political donations. Mr Kanemaru is also not
the only Japanese politician allegedly to have received generous funding
from the construction industry, raising the prospect that other leading LDP
officials will be spotlighted.
However, the prosecutors, who have leaked many of their findings to Japanese
newspapers, may see the publicity as warning enough to the industry and to
politicians.
Prosecutors are said to be investigating whether charges of bribery can be
sustained against a list of politicians who allegedly received funds from
contractors. Construction industry representatives deny they have been a
party to bribery, but have conceded that the system of political donations
should be made more transparent.
The Fair Trade Commission, the anti-monopoly body, is also under public
pressure to ensure there is no bid-rigging for public works projects.
Tokyo's District Court is due to rule today on a petition for Mr Kanemaru's
release from custody. If found guilty in a case which may take many years to
settle, he will liable to pay Y2.14bn in penalties and back taxes.

FT  29 MAR 93 / 'Crucial' talks today in Tyneside shipyard dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGEMENT and unions at a Tyneside ship repair company where 350 workers
have been given redundancy notices after rejecting a cost-cutting pay deal
meet today in an attempt to find common ground.
The talks, described by management as 'crucial' and by the unions as 'make
or break', are being held as the workers enter the sixth week of their
12-week notice period.
They have been told that if they want to work for A &amp; P Appledore Tyne
beyond mid-May they must accept new terms of employment. The workers, who
earlier this month staged a one-day unofficial strike, have since voted in a
ballot by four to one for industrial action.
The company, part of A &amp; P Appledore Holdings, says it must cut costs at its
Tyneside repair yards in North Shields and Wallsend because of the world
recession and increasing competition. It says the yards made a loss last
year. 'The very existence of the company is on the line,' it said.
The package rejected by the hourly paid employees includes a pay freeze and
reductions in other payments. The unions are especially opposed to proposals
that temporary workers should be paid lower rates than permanent employees,
and that entitlement to idle-time payments when lack of work results in
layoffs should be reduced from the present maximum of 60 days a year.
Mr David Blincow, managing director of A &amp; P Appledore Tyne, said: 'We have
to get about 10 per cent of costs out of the business.'

<TEXT>
JOB TRAINING in Scotland lags behind the rest of the UK, according to the
Labour party. The Department of Employment's figures show that in Scotland
only 9.3 per cent of employed people aged from 16 to 64 are in training
compared with 11.4 per cent in the UK as a whole.
Shadow Scottish affairs spokesman Mr Henry McLeish said Scottish Office
ministers had shown 'sneering complacency' by their failure to meet their
own youth training guarantee to more than 8,000 young Scots.

FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Tide that turned in favour of Noir
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the few to have withstood the tide of mainstream conservatism last
night was Mr Michel Noir, mayor of Lyons and former member of the RPR
Gaullist party.
Key to Mr Noir's 58 per cent vote in the run-off was the fact that his
opponent, Mr Alain Merieux, the official RPR candidate, gained the unwelcome
personal endorsement of the National Front candidate eliminated in the first
round a week ago. Mr Merieux thus seemed to have gained fewer votes from the
NF than he lost from left-wing electors who came out to back the mayor in
what they saw as a proxy fight against the NF.
Mr Merieux had come out of the first round on March 18 narrowly ahead of Mr
Noir. He seemed well placed to capitalise after a campaign funding scandal
at the centre of which was the mayor's son-in-law, Mr Pierre Botton. Mr
Botton, a Lyons businessman, is now in jail.
What turned the tide in his favour, Mr Noir claimed last night, was the
sense of independence of the Lyonnais who did not want to see their city's
politics dictated by RPR party HQ in Paris, and Mr Merieux's 'alliance' with
the NF.
Mr Noir was once an RPR minister of trade, but left the party several years
ago to try to form his own local movement.
That failed because 'Noirist' candidates did not win any seats in Lyons. He
said last night he saw himself as a member of the parliament's 'new
majority', but added it was not clear in which group he would sit.

FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Left's leaders paint gloomy picture of
problems they face
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLITICIANS are often prone to melodramatics, but last night the leaders of
France's defeated Socialist party seemed to be locked in masochistic contest
to find the most scathing ways of describing their appalling performance in
the parliamentary elections.
Mr Laurent Fabius, insouciant first secretary of the Socialists, spoke of 'a
very severe defeat'. Mr Pierre Beregovoy, who will this morning tender his
resignation as prime minister, painted a gloomy picture of 'the many
problems' awaiting the French left. Even Mr Jack Lang, the usually ebullient
arts minister, was reduced to adjuring the Socialists 'not to lose hope'.
The critical question for the Socialists as the results filtered through
last night was whether they would win the minimum 58 parliamentary seats
necessary to table motions of censure against the government and thereby
cling to their status as a mainstream party, rather than be relegated to the
ranks of the minorities alongside the Communists and the National Front.
With all but eight of the 577 seats counted last night the Socialists had
only 53. Whatever the final tally, the French left must tackle the painful
question of its future. Should it abandon the Socialist party that President
Francois Mitterrand revived in 1971 and which has been the fulcrum of French
centre-left politics ever since? If so, what should replace it?
Only a few weeks ago the answer seemed obvious. The Socialists had appeared
doomed to defeat ever since the start of the campaign.
Weary after nearly a decade in government and scarred by scandals, they had
been tumbling in the opinion polls ever since President Mitterrand's
disastrous decision two years ago to replace Mr Michel Rocard as prime
minister with the unpopular Mrs Edith Cresson.
But on February 17 Mr Rocard made a stirring speech at a rally in
Montlouis-sur-Loire near the city of Tours, scene of the original Socialist
party's dissolution in 1920. He called on the French left to jettison
socialism in favour of a 'big bang' alliance with ecologists, progressive
communists, human rights activists and even conservative centrists.
The 'big bang' met with a rapturous reception from senior socialists and
other influential figures, including Mr Bernard Kouchner, the charismatic
health minister, and Mr Brice Lalonde, founder of the Generation Ecologie
environmental movement. Even the electorate responded positively. The
Socialists rose in the opinion polls for the first time in the campaign.
Mr Rocard's proposals did, after all, seem to make sense. The ecologists,
who first emerged as a political force in last spring's regional elections
when they won 14 per cent of the votes, had done so well earlier in the
parliamentary campaign that, at one stage, they threatened to steal second
place from the Socialists. A coalition of Socialists and ecologists ought in
theory to have stood a good chance of ousting the conservatives.
But the outcome of the parliamentary elections has raised serious questions
about the validity of Mr Rocard's proposals. The ecologists are no longer
such attractive partners for the Socialists. They polled 7.6 per cent of the
first round votes last Sunday and failed to win a single seat in yesterday's
second round. Mr Lalonde's Generation Ecologie, always more receptive to Mr
Rocard's overtures than the radical pressure groups within the Greens, did
particularly badly with just 3.6 per cent of the first round.
The Socialists themselves did much worse than expected. Mr Fabius, Mr
Beregovoy and Mr Lang all managed to keep their seats, as did Mr Bernard
Tapie, minister of towns. But the conservatives now command the largest
majority of any French parliament since the early 19th century. A number of
senior Socialists lost their places in parliament, notably Mr Roland Dumas,
foreign minister, Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, Mr Michel
Sapin, finance minister, Mr Lionel Jospin, former education minister, and
even Mr Rocard himself.
Moreover Mr Rocard's premise that the left was moving smoothly towards the
centre has been stymied by the unexpectedly strong performance of the
Communists. In the first round of voting last Sunday the Communists polled a
respectable 9.8 per cent, against 17.6 per cent for the Socialists, and last
night were on course to retain most of their seats in the National Assembly.
Even Mr Georges Marchais, the veteran Communist leader, managed to defy the
polls by clinging on to his Paris constituency.
The Communists' performance admittedly owes more to the idiosyncracies of
the French electoral system than to a genuine groundswell of support for the
extreme left. But their relative success has undoubtedly added yet another
obstacle to the 'big bang' initiative. Mr Kouchner, one of Mr Rocard's
staunchest supporters, said on television last night that the French 'do not
seem to look at the future in terms of the left'.
Even Mr Rocard seemed stumped yesterday. He confirmed on French television
that, despite his defeat in his Yvelins constituency on the outskirts of
Paris, he still plans to run as Socialist candidate in the 1995 presidential
elections. But he added wearily: 'This is neither the time nor the place' to
discuss it.'

SOCIALIST supporters appeared to have ignored an appeal to mobilise and
reduce the scale of their party's defeat in the second round of the National
Assembly elections yesterday, agencies report from Paris.
The Interior Ministry said total turn-out was 53.78 per cent by 5pm compared
with 56.11 per cent at the same time in last Sunday's first round.
The Socialists had appealed to people who skipped voting last week to
contain the expected rout by the opposition conservatives.
The abstention rate last week was 31 per cent. Analysts said significantly
lower abstention this week could help the Socialists slightly.
In the first round, the opposition Union pour la France (UPF) alliance
scored 39.5 per cent of the vote and won 80 seats outright. It is forecast
to win as many as 500 of the 577 seats in the National Assembly. The
Socialists crashed to 17.6 per cent of the vote last week and are expected
to win as few as 40 seats in parliament.
The Socialists had called for the backing from the left and the 31 per cent
of voters who sat out the first round to prevent a right-wing takeover
turning France into a 'banana republic'.
Surrounded by photographers and journalists, President Francois Mitterrand
cast his ballot in the central village of Chateau-Chinon. He was to fly back
to Paris by helicopter in time to watch the results come in. Voting went
largely without incident under clear skies around the country. A false bomb
alert interrupted balloting for about 20 minutes at the village of
Ille-sur-Tet in the Pyrenees mountains.

run-off

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S centre-right coalition last night swept to victory, leaving the
outgoing Socialists and other leftwing parties with fewer than 100 seats in
the 577-seat National Assembly.
With 569 seats counted, the RPR Gaullists and the centre-right UDF parties
had won 458 seats and the Socialists had only 53. Several ministers of the
outgoing Socialist government lost their seats.
Within the victorious coalition, the Gaullist RPR party had a clear lead in
seats over its UDF partner, making it highly likely that President Francois
Mitterrand will choose the new prime minister from within the RPR's ranks.
The president will today receive the resignation of Socialist prime minister
Pierre Beregovoy, who at least saved his own parliamentary seat. Mr
Mitterrand is in theory free to pick the prime minister of his choice. In
practice, he is likely to have to choose a premier from the party that has
gained most seats.
Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR leader whose main ambition is to succeed Mr
Mitterrand in the presidency in 1995, indicated that he did not expect to be
the new premier. The new government would have 'all my support', he said. Mr
Chirac's preferred candidate for the premiership is Mr Edouard Balladur, the
RPR finance minister in the conservatives' first cohabitation government
under President Mitterrand.
After the Gaullist lead was confirmed, former president Valery Giscard
d'Estaing, the UDF leader, said: 'I do not see under what circumstances I
would have a role in this (new) government.'
The Socialists were likely to end with fewer than 60 seats, compared with
the 266 which they and their minor allies had held in the last parliament.
The Socialist rout was dramatically underscored by the defeat of Mr Michel
Rocard, who hopes to be the party's standard-bearer in the 1995 presidential
contest, although an opinion poll showed most voters believed he should give
up the race.
Another Socialist heavyweight to fall last night was Mr Roland Dumas, the
foreign minister, who failed to keep his Dordogne seat. He is considered
likely to go to the Elysee Palace as a presidential adviser on foreign
policy, expected to be a contested area in Mr Mitterrand's cohabitation with
the conservatives.
Two of President Mitterrand's Socialist favourites, Mr Bernard Tapie and Mr
Jack Lang, respectively the ministers for cities and for education, kept
their seats.
The turn-out appeared to be no higher than the 68.9 per cent in last week's
first round of voting. The outgoing Socialist government thus failed in its
call on leftwing voters and abstentionists to rally behind it to limit the
size of the centre-right landslide, which in the first round saw 80 seats
going to the conservatives and none to the left.
Under the French parliamentary system, in which 58 votes are needed to
launch censure motions against the government, the Socialists have barely
done well enough to perform as an effective opposition. But they will get
support from the Communists who were assured of retaining at least 23 of
their 25 seats, thanks largely to the heavy geographical concentration of
their supporters. Mr Georges Marchais, the Communist leader, was re-elected.
The extreme rightwing National Front, led by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen who has
failed to enter parliament, lost its only seat.

Three Royal Navy officers were returned to their ship yesterday after being
abducted by French fishermen. The officers, from the fishery protection ship
HMS Brocklesby, suspected the French trawler of illegal fishing and boarded
it off Alderney. La Calypso ignored orders to make for Guernsey and headed
for Cherbourg with the officers on board. It was the second time in three
days that a French fishing boat had been challenged inside the Channel
Islands' six mile limit. Later French fishermen seized the Royal Navy patrol
boat HMS Blazer in Cherbourg harbour, where it was on a goodwill visit. They
held the vessel for three hours and burnt its white ensign flag.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Lend to private sector, bank told: The IADB meeting in
Hamburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH-LEVEL group established to advise the InterAmerican Development Bank
on how to strengthen the private sector in Latin America has recommended
that the bank lend money directly to private concerns.
There are growing worries that without a shift in bank policy it might be
impossible to obtain finance for infrastructure projects, which many Latin
governments - after a wave of privatisation - are now relying on the private
sector to build. The World Bank and the IADB are both forbidden from lending
without government guarantee.
The group's report, put before the IADB board of governors at the weekend,
recommended 5-10 per cent of the bank's lending could be directed to helping
finance private infrastructure, without government guarantees. Limited sums
might also be lent to private-sector intermediaries financing small
businesses.
The Bush administration in the US last year said the bank should consider
lending to the private sector, and the idea is favoured by Chile, Argentina
and now Mexico, which previously opposed it. However, European government
shareholders were lukewarm.
The group's report also recommended radical restructuring of the
InterAmerican Investment Corporation, the offshoot of the bank which lends
to and makes equity investment in private projects. The corporation has been
given 'a mission impossible' and its current structure was 'no longer
viable'. However, it should continue as a separate entity, the report said.
The Bush administration suggested the IIC should be merged with the bank.
Ecuador's finance minister, Mr Mario Ribadeneira, met the country's main
bank creditors, led by Lloyds of Britain, in negotiations over a debt relief
package. Negotiations are expected today over Brazil's debt restructuring
and tomorrow over Poland's.

OIL exporters are considering practical measures to counter US and European
moves to impose energy taxes, including the possibility of an oil export
tax, Gulf sources said yesterday, Reuter reports from Dubai.
Foreign ministers of the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) will consider the
western taxes in a meeting on April 4. The taxes will also be high on the
agenda of an April 13 meeting in Oman between Opec and non-Opec oil
ministers, the sources said.
Analysts believe a co-ordinated response would be difficult to achieve and
the GCC, composed of pro-western countries, does not want to trigger a trade
war. 'They are not in a position to take strong counter-measures that could
escalate a trade war or confrontation with their major trading partners,'
said a Gulf Arab official source.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Interest rate rise may be threat to Latin America: The IADB
meeting in Hamburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE to higher interest rates in industrialised countries could have
destabilising effects on Latin American economies, the InterAmerican
Development Bank says today.
The risk arises because of the region's significant reliance on capital
inflows drawn by higher interest rates.
'The possibility for a reduction of external capital inflows in the near and
medium term, brought on by the possibility of higher interest rates in
industrialised countries, could have a destabilising effect on the economies
of the region,' the bank says in its annual report.
The prospects for further growth in the region are otherwise encouraging.
Nonetheless, economic growth in Latin America slowed from 3.2 per cent in
1991 to 2.6 per cent in 1992, with the 1 per cent fall in Brazilian gross
domestic product last year accounting for much of the slowdown.
However, deteriorating trade pushed up the region's current account deficit
to Dollars 26.5bn (Pounds 18.6bn) last year from Dollars 17bn in 1991.
'While a current account deficit of this magnitude is probably not
sustainable over the long term, it is mainly the product of the region's
economic recovery and increased capital inflows.'
Foreign exchange reserves rose to cover six months of imports, with net
transfers of funds into the region, which were negative from 1982 to 1990,
rising from a positive Dollars 8bn in 1991 to Dollars 27bn last year.
The report emphasised the need for social reforms: 'Economic and social
reforms are mutually reinforcing, ensuring each other's sustainability.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Argentina to sell state gas wells: The IADB meeting in
Hamburg
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Argentine government has decided to auction more gas wells belonging to
the state-owned oil company YPF, before the company's privatisation this
year.
Argentine officials said the sale was in response to concerns that the
company, which holds up to 80 per cent of the country's gas reserves, would
be able to exploit its virtual monopoly position in gas once it was
privatised. The aim would be to reduce its share of gas reserves to 40 per
cent.
YPF is the oldest state oil company in the world and its valuation after a
radical restructuring - now almost complete - has been put by the government
at Dollars 8bn (Pounds 5.6bn). Gas pipeline and distribution companies were
privatised late last year.
The government has also set a schedule for the sale of the rest of YPF as a
single entity. An initial public offering to international and domestic
investors is scheduled for the third quarter of this year.
The officials said the government was also studying mechanisms to make sure
control of the company was in private-sector hands after the offering, even
though the government would remain the largest - though possibly a minority
 -shareholder. Possible options included converting the government's
remaining shares into non-voting stock, and limiting its representation on
the board.
Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch are likely to be given the
mandate to handle the offering.

FT  29 MAR 93 / World machine tool production down 19% as recession bites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLDWIDE production of machine tools fell 19 per cent last year to Dollars
34.6bn (Pounds 24bn), underlining the severity of the recession in virtually
all the main markets for the metalworking machines on which manufacturing
industry depends.
Consumption fell 20 per cent from Dollars 39.4bn to Dollars 31.4bn in the 34
countries covered by American Machinist in its annual survey of the
industry. The declines are the worst in the 30 years since the US magazine
started its surveys.
The declines are led by a staggering fall of 31.8 per cent in Japanese
consumption (36 per cent if measured in yen), while production has fallen
from Dollars 11.6bn to Dollars 8.7bn.
Domestic demand has fallen because of excess capacity in the car and other
customer industries.
Japan retains its position as top producer and user of machine tools, but
Germany has closed the gap in second place. Even so, German consumption fell
16.8 per cent in dollar terms and is still falling this year.
The fallout from reunification, combined with high interest rates caused by
heavy capital transfers to Germany's eastern states, is discouraging
investment in machine tools in western Germany.
In the US, the world's third largest producing and consuming market,
consumption fell 10.7 per cent but production was down only marginally from
Dollars 3.27bn to Dollars 3.19bn.
Several machine tool builders have said recently that the US market is
picking up steam, and domestic orders rose 2 per cent last year.
The few bright spots in the survey come from Asia.
China reported an increase of 20 per cent in production - from Dollars
1.44bn to Dollars 1.74bn - which took it from 10th to fifth place, while
consumption rose 27 per cent to Dollars 2.31bn.
The rises, says the magazine, seem to be the result of growth of a market
economy in the southern provinces close to Hong Kong. However, it notes
Chinese production figures are reported in renminbi, the internal currency
and therefore may be inflated in dollar terms.
In Taiwan, domestic consumption rose 17.6 per cent to Dollars 759.8m. But
total production fell for the first time in living memory, albeit very
marginally, from Dollars 992.2m to Dollars 983.7m.
In contrast, both production and domestic consumption fell sharply last year
in South Korea, where the machine tool market is in recession and producers'
stocks have been rising.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Pollution rights go to auction: A new move to curb SO2
emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURIE MORSE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Environmental Protection Agency today announces the results of its
first public auction of pollution rights, a benchmark in its novel
market-based strategy to reduce acid rain.
The agency has doled out emissions permits to 110 of the largest sulphur
dioxide (SO) polluters, most of them coal-burning electric utilities, and
will allow the companies to trade any permits, or 'allowances', they hold in
excess of their own requirements to meet pollution standards.
A utility that has, for example, reduced its harmful emissions by installing
smokestack 'scrubbers', or has switched to low-sulphur coal or natural gas,
might recover costs by selling excess SO allowances.
The 1990 Clean Air Act requires US electric utilities to halve their
emissions of sulphur dioxide, the harmful element in acid rain, by the year
2000. The EPA plans to phase in its tougher standards, and the pollution
allowance programme, in two phases. The first phase will involve an annual
issue of permits from 1995 to 1999.
The second phase, starting in 2000, will require all SO polluters, not just
the dirtiest utilities, to meet compliance standards, and SO allowances will
be limited to 8.9m tons annually, well below the 20m tons currently
generated each year in the US.
The programme has been endorsed by both political parties and by
environmental groups such as the Environmental Defence Fund, because it
provides a cost-effective alternative to 'command and control' regulation.
Its proponents, including Vice-President Al Gore, believe the SO experiment
will lead to other market-based ways to control environmental disruption.
Only a small percentage of allocated emissions allowances will be priced and
traded at this month's auction, which is being conducted by the Chicago
Board of Trade. The CBoT won the right to administer the auction in a
three-way bidding war with the New York Mercantile Exchange and the New
York-based financial broker-dealer Cantor Fitzgerald.
All three hope to develop lucrative markets in environmental rights, though
regulatory hurdles have so far limited trading in the SO allowances. Cantor
Fitzgerald has set up a special division, Environmental Brokerage Services,
to create screen-traded forward markets for pollution rights. The SO
allowances will be its first product.
'We see a great opportunity here,' says Mr Carlton Bartels, director of the
division. 'There are two important trends emerging in this country. First,
people are demanding a cleaner environment, and second, the government
doesn't have any money to waste. There is great potential in market-based
allocation systems.'
The CBoT hopes to develop an electronic spot market in pollution allowances,
and later, a futures market. The Nymex, which expects to launch electricity
futures some time next year, believes its energy-market constituency will
give it a way into the pollution market.
Despite the enthusiasm, utilities are wary of the market and trading has
been spotty. Most are nervous about how their main overseers, state public
utility commissions, will treat a pollution trade. The state agencies so far
have not formulated policies on how SO allowances will be accounted for, and
if cost savings or profits would pass to shareholders or utility customers.
The utilities are also sensitive to environmental activists. When Long
Island Lighting (Lilco), a New York utility whose emissions generally blow
out to sea, sold its SO allowances to Amax Energy, a coal producer which
intends to market the permits with its high-sulphur coal to midwestern
utilities, New York State and an Adirondack mountains environmental group
cried foul.
They fear acid rain in New York will worsen under the programme, because it
could allow tall midwestern smokestacks upwind to increase SO emissions.
Their objections are not expected to block the programme. However, the case
generated unwelcome publicity for Lilco.
Utilities participating in EPA's auction this week can sidestep that problem
by remaining anonymous and using CBoT clearing firms to execute their bids.
EPA has set aside 50,000 phase one permits, and 100,000 phase two permits to
sell at the auction. These will be sold to the highest bidder until all are
allocated. Each permit represents one ton of sulphur dioxide emissions.
In addition, the CBoT has been commissioned by utility companies to sell
95,000 phase one and 30,000 phase two permits. Those permits will be subject
to minimum prices.
The results will provide the first public price discovery for the programme.
'Cash trades in allowances have been extremely rare because of the
difficulting in establishing a market price for them,' says Mr Kenneth
Rosenzweig, a partner in the Chicago law firm of Schiff, Hardin and Waite
who is advising clients on the emerging market.
Presumably, the permits will be priced below the cost of installing
scrubbers, and well below the Dollars 2,000-a-ton fine the EPA plans to levy
on polluters who do not comply with the programme's emissions standards.

FT  29 MAR 93 / G7's reluctant convert to Russia's cause: Japanese
misgivings about aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN a mainstream Japanese magazine recently shouted 'Yeltsin, Starve to
Death]', the harsh headline reflected a frustration distilled during a
century of unease between the two countries and made more potent by
international demands that Tokyo assist the 'unreliable Russians'.
Through gritted teeth, Japan has invited Mr Yeltsin to the Tokyo summit of
the Group of Seven nations, but there is a deep anguish that the country
must be pleasant to Russia without the prospect of much in return. Also,
there is annoyance that most G7 members are blind to the Japanese vision of
history.
Other G7 countries may have haunting visions of the collapse of Russian
democracy or of bloody civil war, but Japan dwells more on the past than the
future. The preoccupation with settling old debts will colour the country's
response in the coming months as the host-nation of the G7 summit in July,
and play a sometimes difficult-to-perceive role in the international debate
on Russia.
Given an uncompromised choice, Japan would not rush to provide assistance to
Russia. But, wanting to avoid an embarrassing diplomatic isolation, the
government has promised funds, and Mr Michio Watanabe, the blunt but
revealing foreign minister, retreated from his assessment that 'it is wrong
to give top priority to economic assistance'.
Japan has promised Dollars 2.8bn (Pounds 1.97bn), more than half of which is
trade insurance; so far a third of the total has been disbursed. History
aside, Japan has genuine misgivings about pouring funds into Russia when
there is no guarantee that they will be used profitably. The government has
also agreed to host a meeting of G7 foreign and finance ministers in
mid-April, an event that will itself increase the pressure on Tokyo to give
generously.
Having once described the Russian leader as 'dishonest', Mr Watanabe is a
good case study of the conflicting emotions working away inside Japanese
officials. Policy on Russia is handled almost solely by the Foreign
Ministry, in contrast to, say, China policy, which is influenced by vested
economic interests and the personal interests of powerful politicians.
While officials in Tokyo admit that China suffered terribly at the hands of
the invading Japanese army, they are adamant that Russia was an unprincipled
aggressor at the end of the Pacific war. The obvious symbol of this
continuing 'injustice' is the disputed Kurile Islands group, known here as
the Northern Territories, and occupied by Soviet troops at the end of the
war.
Mr Michio Royama, professor of international politics at Sophia University,
explained that 'historically, we don't have a friendly feeling towards
Russia,' and that there is a 'strong anti-Russian faction in the Foreign
Ministry' which is distorting the Japanese reaction to the changes in that
country.
'In the case of most countries, there are, you might say, 'pro' factions and
'anti' factions, as in the case of the US. This is not so with Russia,'
Professor Royama said. 'There were a lot of frictions before World War Two,
but people have forgotten what we did to Russia. Also, Russia has lost its
power. It is not of value for Japan.'
The rapid collapse of Russian power has exposed a long-hidden contempt in
Tokyo, once intimidated by the Kremlin's claimed 'moral authority' of
communism and in awe of Soviet military prowess. Communism has lost that
power to intimidate as an ideology, and Russia was revealed to be a decaying
society.
Japan would prefer that other countries shared their suspicions. Professor
Tadae Takubo of Kyorin University suggested that what Europeans see as a
disaster, the dumping of Yeltsin, would serve Japan's interests: 'The most
desirable outcome in Russia for Japan is that Yeltsin is defeated before the
summit; Europeans would then lose a reason for supporting Russia'.

THEY all showed up yesterday: the destitute pensioners, the flashy
entrepreneurs, the impoverished intellectuals and professionals, and
rough-skinned workers, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
Just as he was offering to give up the referendum he had called for April
25, President Boris Yeltsin's supporters turned out in their biggest numbers
since the August 1991 coup to urge him to stop compromising with his
conservative opponents.
'Enough Compromises with Communist Criminals,' said one of the banners
attacking the Congress of People's Deputies. Equally numerous were attacks
on its speaker, Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, who was likened to Stalin and urged
to return to Chechnya, the rebellious southern region which has declared
independence from Russia and recalled him as its deputy.
'We may eat only bread, but we must be free of these Communists who choked
Russia for 70 years,' said Klava, a retired metal worker and one of the
millions of pensioners whose living standards have been ravaged by the
reforms. 'We won't die, we will survive.'
With pop music, snack stalls, and portable lavatories provided by the Moscow
mayor's office, the lightly-policed event was in stark contrast to a rival
demonstration at the other end of Red Square. There, some 300 baton-wielding
police, including dozens on horseback, hemmed in a demonstration of a few
thousand Communists and extreme nationalists who find so much in common in
modern-day Russia.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Yeltsin rides the Congress peaks and troughs
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Russian Congress of People's Deputies usually refuses to run to a simple
script. It is an inchoate body, made up of shifting factions and allegiances
with many deputies lacking representative experience. But the key to the
ebbs and flows of resolutions, decisions and stalemates of this past weekend
was in the stubborn fact that the deputies lacked the necessary votes to
impeach the president, Mr Boris Yeltsin.
This was despite the fact that after an appearance before the microphones
which frightened his supporters and delighted his opponents because of its
incoherence, he lost that sliver of support which had deprived his foes of
the majority they needed to put the issue on the agenda. To the end, he
seemed able to disappoint them of the two-thirds needed to impeach him.
The congress has registered great waves and troughs in the apparent strength
of the opposing side. On Friday, the president kept firm to his insistence
he hold a referendum of April 25 on trust. He felt strong enough to taunt
the deputies to put the question of trust in themselves on the ballot paper.
The voices from the floor were looking for compromise, following the
defection from the impeachment camp of Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the
parliamentary speaker.
Saturday morning marked the beginning of efforts to find a compromise. A
resolution was put forward by the drafting committee, allowing the
referendum but adding three more questions to the president's original one.
These were: approval for election of president, for election of the deputies
and - the sting in the tail - approval of the results of economic reform,
which the president has consistently supported and which is assumed to be
deeply unpopular. The president's side let if be known this was
unacceptable.
Though they had gathered in the expectation of discussing impeachment, the
issue had not got on the agenda: a vote on Saturday confirmed that the
necessary simple majority to discuss it still did not exist. Nor was the
resolution on a four-question referendum allowed. Later, a harder line
resolution appeared, proposing to suspend those of the president's aides who
had persuaded him to appeal to the people on March 20, cancel his special
powers, and dismiss his appointed provincial governors.
Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, prime minister, took the stage in the morning
session to give a speech of heavily-qualified support for his president, in
which he was careful to say that 'without the president we will not be able
to carry the heavy burden (of reforms)'. But it was also a speech which
inserted the views that all sides were equally guilty for the crisis which
had brought Russia 'to the brink of catastrophe'.
It made the point that a decree issued by Mr Yeltsin early last week
dismissing the chief administrators of Novosibirsk and Irkutsk had had to be
revoked (Mr Chernomyrdin, rather pointedly, had made fulsome apologies to
them for his president's mistake); and that early elections, which Mr
Yeltsin has not favoured, were inevitable. In the general debate, the most
cheered speaker was Mr Aman Tuleev, head of the Kemerovo region, who branded
Mr Yeltsin's much-abused aides as a 'collective Rasputin'. But pro-Yeltsin
deputies took the floor to defend economic reform and charge the Congress
with unconstitutional behaviour.
Mr Yeltsin's appearance before the microphones most harmed him. His face
puffy, his hair flopping, he came to the microphone and with slurred diction
and long pauses, said there should be a week of talks between himself, Mr
Khasbulatov and Mr Chernomyrdin to try to find consensus.
A number of his opponents said he was drunk; his supporters said he was
over-strained; his staff that he was suffering from the effects of his
mother's death last week, an explanation he later proffered himself in
remarks to reporters.
Yesterday morning, another consensus rabbit appeared from the
behind-the-scenes hat. Said to have the support of the president, the
speaker, the prime minister, the leaders of regions and republics and
'several factions', this resolution scrapped the referendum in favour of
November elections to a two-tier parliament (which meant the scrapping of
the present Congress).
Mr Yeltsin, looking a little better, said that were it to be supported, he
would cancel his decree calling for a popular vote on April 25. There
followed some dozen speakers, each of whom denounced the draft agreement: if
any faction really had put their name to it overnight, none admitted it in
the hall. It went down with a mere 134 votes in favour.
A feature of the rhetoric on this issue was an increase in the calls for the
resignation of the Speaker, a move brewing since the beginning of the
Congress, but which now took off. The nimbleness of Mr Khasbulatov's
footwork was now turned against him: he was represented as a man of no
principle.
The proposal to vote on the impeachment of the president was finally put on
the agenda, with 594 deputies voting for its inclusion. At the same time,
slightly more deputies (614) voted to ballot on a no-confidence motion on Mr
Khasbulatov. Mr Yeltsin's vote required two-thirds of the total number, that
is, 689 out of 1,033: Mr Khasbulatov's majority was a mere 517.

FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Defence of franc to dictate policy - The
desire for a new relationship with Bonn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE key element in the new French conservative government's foreign, as well
as domestic, policy will be maintaining the franc's parity with the D-Mark,
as the only achievement which still holds the door open to eventual European
monetary and political union. But that does not mean France's external
policy will be unchanged.
Indeed, it is precisely to maintain the departing Socialist government's
strong currency stance - at a time of wide recession in Europe and record
real interest rates at home - that France's new centre-right governors want
a new relationship with Germany.
All that is mentioned in the joint RPR and UDF manifesto is the need for a
'new initiative' with Germany in the monetary field.
But this is just one - though the most important - element of a package
deal, including a more aggressive European commercial stance and recognition
of Germany's greater geo-political status, which the new government seems to
want to present to Germany.
If the government can get Germany to agree, it believes that President
Francois Mitterrand will have no cause to try to exercise his prerogative in
foreign policy. If the Germans balk, and if an EC crisis erupts, then
France's new government may well face trouble from its president and from
abroad.
The new initiative towards Germany, says an adviser to Mr Edouard Balladur,
the preferred RPR candidate for prime minister, 'will not be the caricature'
often presented by conservative politicians or by the French employers'
federation; France's new prime minister will not dash across the Rhine to
deliver an ultimatum that Bonn and Frankfurt must somehow find a way to
reduce German interest rates by a set percentage by a set date.
Rather, this adviser says, the new government will take 'France's first
opportunity since the fall of the Berlin Wall to discuss a new relationship
with Germany calmly' in an atmosphere unencumbered by the long Maastricht
treaty negotiations. This would involve getting the Germans to acknowledge
that with their goal of integrating the eastern Lander into the federal
republic taking priority over all else, they no longer provide the model of
'balanced growth' for Europe to aim at; that France is now a better
approximation of this model; and that, at the very least, Germany must share
its anchor position in the European monetary system with France.
What does this 'sharing' mean? The answers here are a bit vague. It does not
seem to mean the German government making any precise promise on interest
rate cuts, which only the Bundesbank can deliver on. RPR advisers believe
France has a margin of manoeuvre to lower its interest rates in the coming
months, because its short-term rates are a couple of points above German
ones, because French inflation is half the German rate of price increases,
and because German short-term rates will probably come down another 1-2
percentage points in the next six months.
What the new government absolutely does not want to do is to have to respond
to some short-term speculative crisis by raising French rates. RPR advisers
see the run-up to Denmark's second Maastricht referendum on May 18 as one
such danger point, even if, as expected, the Danes ratify the treaty. If
Denmark votes the treaty down, making subsequent UK ratification improbable
or irrelevant, then the scenario changes to one in which Germany would join
France and some other countries, like the Benelux, in announcing a new
monetary union plan.
So, within its first two months, the new government would like some public
show of monetary co-operation from Germany. Narrowing the franc/D-Mark
fluctuation bands in the EMS is mentioned in Paris, but the Bundesbank might
object that such a move would make its intervention in support of the franc
more predictable, and therefore harder to wrong-foot speculators.
But it seems likely that Paris will expect some early gesture from Germany
to reciprocate its promise to create an identikit Bundesbank by giving the
Banque de France autonomy in monetary policy-setting.
The new government's persuasive powers may be taxed even harder on trade.
But France's conservatives have campaigned themselves to victory on
complaints that the European Commission, passively aided and abetted by the
outgoing French Socialist government, has been dangerously derelict in its
duty to protect not only agriculture but also industry from unfair
international competition.
Europe is being asked to open up too fast on too many fronts, goes the
conservatives' argument in Paris. If Germany wants freer trade with eastern
Europe, then it must join France in ensuring the EC takes a tougher line in
Gatt negotiations.
In return for changing tack on monetary and commercial policy, the new
French government will support Germany's case for a permanent seat on the UN
Security Council. Mr Alain Juppe, the RPR secretary-general who wants to be
the new foreign minister, has been quite explicit about playing this
political card.
Will Germany buy such a deal? Mr Klaus Kinkel, German foreign minister, has
suggested in French minds that it would. The minister has been as keen in
public to welcome an eventual Security Council seat for his country as he
has been overtly impatient about French obstructionism in Gatt. But another
senior German minister has privately retorted recently that there could be
'no deal' on this basis, and that most Germans are not interested in
Security Council prestige to compromise on their basic economic interests.
France's Gaullist politicians may therefore be deluding themselves into
reading into German minds their own reactions to Security Council status.
If the new government can plausibly show some success in its 'new
initiative' towards Germany, then it may find it easier to soft-pedal on
agricultural policy. France will continue to oppose the draft EC-US deal on
farm trade; the incoming conservatives are just angry that the outgoing
Socialists have left it to them to possibly wield France's veto. But Mr
Jean-Pierre Soisson, the departing farm minister, has shown them it is
possible to use guerrilla tactics in Brussels to adapt last year's reform of
EC farm policy more to French interests, instead of trying to rip the reform
up.
In defence policy, the new government will probably continue to edge France
nearer to operational co-operation with Nato. Mr Jacques Chirac, the RPR
leader, is clearly persuaded that with a less US-dominated alliance, there
can be a place for France.
But the Socialists have left one political trap for the new government, by
suspending nuclear weapons tests. Resuming such tests - if the US and Russia
continue their own test bans - could prove explosive, in more than one
sense.

FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: End of road for Dumas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the first casualties of the Socialists' defeat last night was Mr
Roland Dumas, the foreign minister, who lost his seat at Sarlat in the
Dordogne to Mr Jean-Jacques de Peretti, the local Gaullist mayor.
The loss of his constituency brings Mr Dumas, 70, to the end of a long
political career in which he has been as influential in his personal role as
a confidant of President Francois Mitterrand as in his professional
ministerial posts.
Mr Dumas spent his early career in journalism but went into politics in the
late 1950s. He served as minister of European affairs during the first
Mitterrand government from 1981 to 1983, moving on to external relations
until 1986 and becoming foreign minister when the Socialists returned to
power in 1988.
The Foreign Ministry has been something of a poisoned chalice in French
politics, given that the president is active in foreign affairs. Mr
Mitterrand has been no exception. But Mr Dumas managed to carve out a role
for himself, thanks partly to his close relationship with the president but
also to his own expertise, particularly in oriental studies.
The raffish side of his nature became a distinct disadvantage in the
parliamentary campaign. His bid for re-election has been dogged by a blaze
of publicity over his friendship with Ms Nahed Ojjeh, daughter of Mr
Mustapha Tlass, the Syrian defence minister, and by the revelation that her
family paid for a new Pounds 1m scanner at a Sarlat hospital.
Mr Dumas does at least have the consolation that his links with Mr
Mitterrand seem to be intact. When the president last week came under
pressure from the Gaullists to resign, he turned to two trusty Socialists to
communicate his views. One was Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, the
other was Mr Dumas.

<TEXT>
ONCE the final tally of votes in yesterday's parliamentary election is
proclaimed this morning, France will move on to the other issues which will
determine its political fortunes for the next two years - the choice of the
prime minister and the cabinet.
The conservatives' victory has been regarded as a foregone conclusion for so
long that President Francois Mitterrand has had plenty of time to mull over
the various contenders for the premiership. In theory he has a free choice,
but in practice he must choose a candidate who can command a majority in
parliament.
The first step towards announcement of the new French premier will be the
resignation of Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the present incumbent. He will go this
morning to the Elysee Palace to tender his resignation personally to the
president.
Mr Mitterrand has traditionally tended to disclose the name of the new prime
minister later on the same day; he did so in 1986 at the start of the last
cohabitation government, when he announced in the evening his choice of Mr
Jacques Chirac, head of the Gaullist RPR party.
The president has an empty agenda today. But he may wish to delay announcing
any decision either because he is genuinely undecided or because,
characteristically, he wants to keep the conservatives on tenterhooks. The
only constraint is that he must appoint a premier in time for the first
session of the National Assembly on Friday, which means he has to make his
choice by Wednesday evening at the latest.
The next step will be the selection of the new cabinet, which must also be
approved by Mr Mitterrand. The president objected in 1986 to Mr Chirac's
suggested candidates for foreign affairs and defence.
The president is almost certain to object to at least one of the new prime
minister's suggestions this time, if only because he will consider it
critical that he exerts his influence as quickly as possible over the new
cohabitation government.
He will also be anxious to use his power over the choice of cabinet members
to exploit any potential rifts between the conservative parties.
The next important date is Friday, when the new National Assembly will meet
for the first time and appoint its next president to replace the Socialist
Mr Henri Emmanuelli. The constitution stipulates that new parliaments must
begin either on October 2 or April 2, to avoid the ignominy of a new French
government starting on April Fool's Day, or jour de poisson as it is called
in France.

FT  29 MAR 93 / French Elections: Chirac's party in strong position to set
out terms

<TEXT>
MR Jacques Chirac's Gaullist RPR party has become the largest single force
in the new French parliament, writes Alice Rawsthorn in Paris. With 569 of
the 577 constituencies counted in yesterday's second round of voting for the
National Assembly, the RPR had 245 seats compared with 213 seats for the
UDF, its main partner in the conservative coalition.
Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, leader of the UDF, said his main ambition had
been for his party to get more than 200 seats. However, during the campaign
he said he had wanted parity with the RPR.
The RPR is now in an extremely strong bargaining position when it comes to
the choice of prime minister, who is selected by the French president but
who traditionally comes from the largest party in the National Assembly, and
also in the allocation of ministerial posts.
Mr Chirac, who was prime minister in the last cohabitation government from
1986 to 1988, has made it clear that he does not want the job again, saying
that the thought 'sends shivers down my spine'.
The RPR leader, who is now favourite to win the 1995 presidential elections,
does not want to risk a repetition of the embarrassing, humiliating clashes
with Socialist President Francois Mitterrand, which he believes cost him the
1988 presidential campaign.
However, Mr Chirac is keen for an RPR candidate to be chosen as prime
minister, preferably Mr Edouard Balladur, a mild-mannered man who served as
finance minister in the last conservative government. Last week Mr
Mitterrand threatened to choose a premier from outside the RPR if Mr Chirac
persisted in his calls for the president's resignation.
Mr Mitterrand is in principle still free to look outside the RPR for his
prime minister, but the scale of the Gaullists' lead over the UDF makes it
considerably less likely that he will do so.
The RPR's ascendancy should also help Mr Chirac in his bargaining with the
UDF over cabinet posts, thereby having important implications for the future
of French policy.
There are significant splits between the two conservative parties on
important areas of policy, notably in foreign affairs, where the Gaullists
are less enthusiastic than the UDF about continuing France's close monetary
links with Germany and much more aggressive about sabotaging last summer's
European community agricultural reforms.
However, the RPR's room for manoeuvre will be restricted by the influence of
President Mitterrand who has the right to veto cabinet appointments and who
will be particularly anxious to establish his own authority, as head of
state, over foreign affairs.
But there is little that the president, or even Mr Chirac, can do to muffle
the rogue voices in the Gaullist camp, notably those of Mr Charles Pasqua
and Mr Philippe Seguin, who led the anti-Maastricht campaign in last
autumn's referendum and have since argued forcefully for the devaluation of
the franc.
Their party's success may make the RPR rogues even more confident about
raising their voices in future.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
JOCKEYING FOR POWER IN A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
RPR: Rassemblement pour la Republique. The Gaullist party; more
     nationalist than its UDF partner (see below). Both RPR and UDF
     campaigned in support of privatisation, budget cuts and autonomy
     for the Banque de France. Large majority of RPR leaders favour
     keeping the franc strong. The RPR for which most farmers vote, is
     very hostile to EC and Gatt agriculture reforms.
UDF: Union pour la Democratie Francaise. Federation of five centre-right
     parties. Fought on common platform with RPR. However, UDF more
     free-market and pro-EC and more favourable to decentralisation than
     RPR.
CDS: Centre des Democrates Sociaux. Small party affiliated to UDF.
     French version of Christian Democrats.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Jacques Chirac
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Age 61. Leader of the RPR. Prime Minister twice, once (1974-6) under
  Giscard d'Estaing and once (1986-88) under Mitterand, and does not
  want the job again. Is already effectively running for the presidency
  to succeed Mitterand in 1995, and wants to place government in hands
  of his trusty lieutenant, Edouard Balladur.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Valery Giscard d'Estaing
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 67. Leader of the UDF. As an ex-president (1974-81) does not
  hanker after the prime ministership. But will bargain hard for
  maximum UDF influence in new government. Is more enigmatic than
  Chirac about running for the presidency but will do so if he thinks
  he has a chance. Has a reciprocated dislike of Chirac.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Edouard Balladur
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 63. Former finance minister in the second Chirac government and
  the RPR's frontrunner for prime minister. His political moderation,
  economic orthodoxy and pro-EC stance would make him the most
  acceptable RPR premier to the UDF. Has stated publicly he does not
  want to be president, so allaying fears of potential rivals that he
  might use premiership as a stepping stone.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Alain Juppe
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 47. RPR secretary-general. Very close to Chirac and one of his
  deputies as mayor of Paris. Would now like to get out from Chirac's
  shadow. Has been budget minister (1986-88) and could do another
  economics job. But fancies a higher profile this time as foreign
  minister at the Quai d'Orsay.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Charles Pasqua
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 65. RPR leader in the Senate. This former drinks salesman
  incarnates populist, hardline Gaullism and was a leader of the
  anti-Maastricht campaign in last year's referendum. Was interior
  minister (1986-88) and would like to be defence minister. Advocates
  creation of a reserve national guard if France moves away from
  conscription to a more professional army.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Edmond Alphandery
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 49. An economics professor turned UDF politician. Keen supporter
  of European monetary union and a strong franc as the best way to get
  there. Turned down Mitterand's offer in December of one of France's
  two European commissionerships, partly to be available for the
  Finance Ministry. But may have too many of his own ideas about
  finance to suit Balladur.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Pierre Mehaignerie
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 53. Leader of the small CDS. Has been minister of agriculture
  (1977-81) and would like to be finance minister. Fact that he is
  less well qualified than Alphandery would not be a handicap to
  Balladur, who wants to exert close influence on finance. Big role
  for CDS would help neutralise temptation for centrists to flirt with
  Socialist contenders - like Michel Rocard or Jacques Delors - in the
  1995 presidential race.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
Alain Madelin
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Aged 47. Senior UDF leader who negotiated, on his party's behalf,
  common programme with the RPR. But failed to persuade his party or the
  RPR leadership that the franc should be floated as the only way to
  control influence on France of Germany's high interest rates. A
  genuine free-market liberal (a rarity in French politics). Was
  industry minister (1986-88) but now seems resigned to a second-ranking
  ministry, perhaps labour or transport

FT  29 MAR 93 / Software institute plans to exploit Europe's expertise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GROUP of leading computer companies and their customers are seeking to
improve Europe's competitiveness by developing, through a new research
institute, better ways to write computer software.
Establishment of the institute in Bilbao, Spain, will be announced today. It
will focus on software processes and the rules and procedures for writing
effective software.
The aim, according to Mr George Grunberg of France's Groupe Bull, acting
chairman of the new institute's board, is to exploit Europe's software
expertise: 'Modern industrial society relies more and more on the
availability and quality of software systems of ever-increasing size and
complexity,' he said.
Difficulties in specifying and writing large software programmes are
recognised as a barrier to the greater use of computerisation in business
and industry. While a number of blueprints or methodologies for software
construction have been created, no universal method of guaranteeing
effective software development has yet been found.
The members of the group include Bilbao Bizkaia Kutxa of Spain, British
Aerospace, Sema Group, Logica and Lloyds Register of the UK, Groupe Bull and
Cap Gemini Sogeti of France, Olivetti and Finsiel of Italy, and Siemens
Nixdorf of Germany.
Each has subscribed Ecu100,000 (Pounds 82,600) to launch the project.
Membership is open to any company with European operations interested in
software development. New members would pay significantly less a year than
the founders, Mr Grunberg said, but would have access to all the research
and results.
A managing director is being sought for the institute, which is expected to
begin work in the summer.
The institute, which will operate on a non-profit basis, has the blessing of
the European Commission although it is wholly an industry-led initiative. It
is expected to employ up to 50 software experts when fully staffed.
Bilbao was chosen after a number of European cities had expressed interest
in hosting the institute. It has a well developed high-technology
infrastructure and close links with US academic research in software
development.

The next step will be the selection of the new cabinet.
Mr Edouard Balladur, still the favourite for prime minister, is said to have

senior figures in the RPR and UDF before finalising his choice.
Moreover, the new cabinet must also be approved by Mr Mitterrand. The
president objected in 1986 to Mr Chirac's suggested candidates for foreign
affairs and defence, both of which are not only important portfolios but
also areas where the president traditionally wields great influence.
The president is almost certain to object to at least one of the new prime
minister's suggestions this time, if only because he will consider it
critical that he exerts his influence as quickly as possible over the new
cohabitation government.
He will also be anxious to use his power over the choice of cabinet members

issues such as foreign policy, where the RPR is more chauvinistic than the
UDF.

Mr Henri Emmanuelli. The constitution stipulates that new parliaments must

FT  29 MAR 93 / EC given food for thought over allocating plum jobs:
National quotas or merit? David Gardner looks at how posts in Brussels are
filled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Court has just blown the gaff on the common practice at the
European Commission of recruiting into its top echelons by national quotas,
rather than on merit, as EC rules formally require.
The landmark ruling has been widely interpreted as a political blow to the
Commission, but it has got some senior Brussels officials rubbing their
hands with glee.
Far from damaging the Commission, the judgment has provided it with a weapon
to resist member states that insist on slotting candidates they choose into
plum Brussels jobs whether or not they are suitable.
The Luxembourg court has overruled appointment of an Italian and a Spaniard
to senior posts in the fisheries directorate of the Commission, finding that
they had been named to nail down slots previously held by compatriots. Two
applicants with better credentials brought the complaint, and the Court
found the appointments were made before the selection process had concluded.
The only shock in this was the sloppiness of the senior Spaniards and
Italians in the Commission, and of Madrid and Rome, who had left lots of
fingerprints of their premature decision-making.
Lobbying for senior Commission posts is the norm. There is no formal
national quota system as in other international organisations such as the
UN. Indeed, the EC rules state that 'no posts shall be reserved for
nationals of any specific member state'.
But the rules also require all EC institutions to recruit 'on the broadest
possible geographical basis' to maintain a more or less even share-out
between the 12.
These rules are 'mutually contradictory,' says a senior official who deals
with personnel policy. 'We do our best to navigate between them,' welcoming
the Court's decision as 'a useful judgment' to help the Commission do so.
But another official who has served in several top political jobs in the
Commission is more caustic. 'We appoint the wrong people, to the wrong jobs,
for the wrong reasons.'
Political appointments are accepted and above board in the cabinets of the
Commissioners, and at the two highest levels of the A-grade policy-making
staff of the Commission. It is also acknowledged practice, though not licit
under the rules, that control of the 23 Brussels directorates-general is
partly shared out on an informal 'national flag' basis.
France has had a lockhold on the agriculture directorate since the Common
Agricultural Policy was set up 30 years ago; financial services and
transport have been British stamping grounds; and Germany has had a long
succession of director generals for competition policy.
In apportioning the rest of the DGs, a lot of log-rolling goes on to give
member states roughly the right number and influence, in proportion to their
size. Thus it was known in February 1991 that a Spaniard would take over the
social policy directorate in October 1992 because Spain was one down on its
quota, having made way for the UK at the transport DG. Belgium, by contrast,
was temporarily one up on its quota; the key to the reshuffle was that there
was a Belgian director general at social affairs who was due to retire.
But this sort of musical chairs has spread further down Commission ranks,
spreading demoralisation along the way. One reason, made plain in a
Commission working document on recruitment of last November, is that
'geographical imbalances among applicants are persisting or getting worse'.
The Commission chooses from a far smaller pool than national bureaucracies,
and in the past five years there has been a sharp rise in applicants from
Belgium and Italy and a steep fall in British and German candidates.
Among the large member states, the UK has always been under-represented:
whereas France, Italy and Germany all have more than 600 A-grade
functionaries, Britain has fewer than 500.
As a latecomer this is partly understandable, and it is also to be expected
that a certain amount of manoeuvring goes on to try to redress this and
other imbalances - particularly given what one official calls the
'clientilist' practices of such member states as Greece and Italy.
The underlying problem is a hopeless imbalance in supply. Of the 93,691
applicants for the 3,459 A-grade posts advertised by competition in 1986-91,
the Commission report shows, the UK fielded only 4,983, Denmark only 1,574,
against 24,734 from host country Belgium, 18,529 from Italy and 10,333 from
France.
The semi-detached Danes and British, though least interested in applying,
have the best pass rates (5.8 and 3.7 per cent respectively, against, say,
2.8 and 1.6 per cent of successful applicants from Belgium and Italy).
Nevertheless, by sheer weight of numbers, Belgium and Italy get between
three and six times more people into the top of the Commission than Britain
and Denmark.
Part of the reason is that Brussels goes after too many specialists, who
face exams that a French-style elite school provides better preparation for
than more generalist training common in such countries as the UK.
Officials say a more rounded approach is now being discussed: to recruit
more generalists; give them a broader grounding by passing them through
several departments before allocating fixed jobs; and relying more on
temporary secondment from national administrations.
This last is partly to circumvent tight restrictions on hiring. The
Commission is kept small, in relative terms, numbering 14,533 officials at
the end of last year, or about the size of the UK agriculture ministry. The
EC countries average 322 civil servants per 10,000 inhabitants, against only
0.8 per 10,000 for all EC institutions together.
Widening the recruitment pool, plus the precedent set by the Court, should
help the Commission to resist nationalist lobbying, but officials warn that
pressures for a carve-up will remain. 'Yes, it will help to resist these
pressures,' says one senior official. 'But to go from there to saying we're
going to be recruiting entirely on merit is unrealistic.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Move to impeach Yeltsin defeated in Congress: Moscow rally
of 60,000 supports president - Deputies fail to unseat Khasbulatov
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, faces a further struggle with
conservative deputies even though they failed to muster enough votes in
parliament yesterday to impeach him.
Mr Ruslan Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, heralded more conflict
between the two rival power centres in Moscow after he, too, survived a
confidence vote by deputies.
In another day of turmoil and demonstrations, the Congress of People's
Deputies cast 617 votes in favour of impeaching Mr Yeltsin, short of the
689, or two-thirds, needed to oust him from office.
After some deputies rounded on Mr Khasbulatov, 339 deputies voted to dismiss
him as speaker but this was well below the 517, or simple majority, needed.
With the political tussle between president and deputies left unresolved, Mr
Khasbulatov signalled more manoeuvring when he pointed out that Congress had
balked at impeaching Mr Yeltsin by a small margin.
The Congress is likely to continue its work today and further efforts may be
made to limit Mr Yeltsin's powers or even to strip him of the presidency by
other means. The surprise attempt to remove both men yesterday was a furious
reaction to an overnight compromise agreement by the two arch-rivals. Under
their pact, Mr Yeltsin would have dropped his plebiscite set for April 25,
the Congress would have been abolished, and early elections would have been
called for president and a smaller legislature.
The vote against Mr Yeltsin's impeachment appears to mean he retains the
special powers he declared for himself last week. Under these powers, his
decrees and instructions can be challenged only by the Constitutional Court
and not by parliament.
Mr Yeltsin drew strength from a rally of about 60,000 supporters, who
gathered behind St Basil's Cathedral, just outside the walls of the Kremlin.
Before the vote, he told the crowd he would not 'submit' to any decision of
Congress to impeach him. After winning the vote, he said: 'A communist coup
has failed. The people have won.'
The rally, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, Mr Genady
Burbulis, the former presidential aide and others, heard Mr Gavril Popov,
leader of the Movement for Democratic Reform, say that: 'We're living badly
because we're conducting the reforms badly. They're trying to turn out the
president because he wants to deepen the reforms - but the people won't let
them.'
A rival gathering of some 10,000 nationalists and communists rallied on the
Manezh Square to hear a succession of calls for Mr Yeltsin's impeachment. In
contrast to the pro-Yeltsin rally, this was heavily policed, with mounted
militia, armoured cars and water cannons ringing the group.
It is the first Congress for more than a year from which Mr Yeltsin has
emerged strengthened. But on Saturday he had used his proposed plebiscite -
about trust in the president - as a bargaining chip: he offered to cancel it
in exchange for an election in November for president and a new two-tier
parliament.
However, deputies rejected this compromise before proceeding to vote
themselves the right to ballot on the future of both Mr Yeltsin and Mr
Khasbulatov. The speaker, who had made several dramatic turnabouts in the
past few days, aroused the ire of many deputies who, according to one, had
'grown plain sick of him'.
Several dangerous elements remain:
President and parliament are now more bitterly opposed than ever. Deprived
of the opportunity to impeach him by parliamentary means, hardline opponents
will be tempted increasingly to turn to extra-parliamentary protest.
The Congress passed a resolution to take control of TV and radio, demanding
the right to appoint supervising committees over all stations with the right
of appointment of chairmen and of interference in programmes. Mr Yeltsin's
main argument for his actions, underscored on Saturday by Mr Viktor
Chernomyrdin, the prime minister, is the 'catastrophic' state of the economy
and the need for rapid action. But this action will weaken his
still-impressive popularity and give extra support to his opponents.
The president will be tempted, in the period to the April 25 plebiscite, to
pass measures that will increase support in him by paying out extra
benefits.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Waterloo terminal may be obsolete in six years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 130m international rail terminal being built at London's Waterloo
station - Britain's biggest station project since the Victorian era - could
become redundant six years after it opens if the Channel tunnel rail link is
built as planned.
Union Railways, the British Rail subsidiary in charge of the Channel tunnel
rail link project, has acknowledged that its plans assume most or all
international train services will switch to a new terminal at St Pancras or
King's Cross when the line opens around the end of the decade.
A small number of trains may continue to run into Waterloo to see if any
demand for them remains, but most passengers are expected to prefer the St
Pancras or King's Cross terminal because it will offer significantly faster
journey times and much better connections with BR and London Underground
services.
Waterloo International station, now nearing completion, has been acclaimed
for its architectural design. Its five platforms, each a quarter of a mile
long, are covered with a canopy incorporating 2 1/2 acres of glass, 2 acres
of stainless steel cladding and 1,000 tonnes of steelwork.
For the first years of Channel tunnel operations, while continental trains
run along Network SouthEast tracks between London and the coast, the station
will be the sole London terminus for international expresses.
At the time the station was planned, it was expected that the new high-speed
link connecting London with the tunnel would approach London from the south
and make equal use of Waterloo and a second terminal to be built at King's
Cross. But those plans have been overtaken by the drastically revised route
published last week by the government, which approaches London from
the east. Under the new plans, trains using the high-speed link will only be
able to reach Waterloo by turning off the line near Gravesend in Kent and
reverting to congested Network SouthEast tracks for the last 22 miles of the
journey. This means the journey to Waterloo will take 17 minutes longer than
the journey to St Pancras or King's Cross, even if the trains have a clear
path.
Mr John Prideaux, Union Railways' chairman, said it was inevitable that
Waterloo would be the loser once the eastern approach to the capital had
been chosen. The benefits would go to north and north-east Kent. 'If you
take the trains into Waterloo, the savings over the old journey times will
be negligible,' Mr Prideaux said. 'We would not say that we will not take
any trains there, but there will be a preference for the majority to go to
King's Cross or St Pancras because it will be quicker.'
A limited service could provide only a temporary reprieve from closure for
Waterloo's international terminal because traffic levels would be too low to
justify continued operation of the airport-style building with arrival and
immigration halls, customs facilities and departure lounges.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Yeltsin survives vote in congress to impeach him: Russian
president strengthens his position - Deputies fail to unseat Khasbulatov
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD, LEYLA BOULTON and JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, yesterday survived a vote by the
Congress of Peoples' Deputies to impeach him. His rival, Mr Ruslan
Khasbulatov, the parliamentary speaker, survived a simultaneous vote of no
confidence.
In a secret ballot, deputies cast 617 votes in favour of impeaching Yeltsin,
short of the 689 required to remove him from office.
It said about 400 members voted to oust Mr Khasbulatov, below the 517 needed
for his dismissal.
The attempt to remove both men was a furious reaction by the Russian
parliament to an overnight compromise agreement by the two arch-rivals which
would have called early elections and abolished the legislature.
The vote against Mr Yeltsin's impeachment appears to mean that he retains
the special powers he declared for himself last week. Under these powers,
his decrees and instructions can be challenged only by the Constitutional
Court and not by parliament.
Mr Yeltsin drew strength yesterday from a rally of about 60,000 supporters,
which gathered behind St Basil's Cathedral, just outside the walls of the
Kremlin. He addressed them soon after a compromise offer had failed. He said
he would 'not submit to any decision of the Congress to impeach me'.
The rally, led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the former prime minister, Mr Genady
Burbulis, the former presidential aide and others, heard Mr Gavril Popov,
leader of the Movement for Democratic Reform, say that: 'We're living badly
because we're conducting the reforms badly. They're trying to turn out the
president because he wants to deepen the reforms - but the people won't let
them.'
A rival gathering of some 10,000 nationalists and communists rallied on the
Manezh Square to hear a succession of calls for the impeachment of the
president. In contrast to the pro-Yeltsin rally, this was heavily policed,
with mounted militia, armoured cars and water cannons ringing the relatively
small group.
It is the first Congress for over a year from which Mr Yeltsin has emerged
strengthened, with no muddled compromise constraining his actions. However,
on Saturday he had used his promised plebiscite on trust in the president on
April 25, which he had represented as a critical opportunity to listen to
the voices of the people, as a bargaining chip: he offered to cancel the
plebiscitein exchange for an election in November for the president and a
new two-tier parliament.
However, deputies rejected this compromise - agreed between Mr Yeltsin, Mr
Khasbulatov and Mr Victor Chernomyrdin, the prime minister - and then
proceeded to vote themselves the right to ballot on the future of both Mr
Yeltsin and Mr Khasbulatov.
The speaker, who had made several dramatic turnabouts over the past few
days, finally aroused the ire of the deputies who - according to one - had
'grown plain sick of him'.
Several dangerous elements remain: The president and the parliament are now
more bitterly opposed than ever. Deprived of the opportunity to impeach him
by parliamentray means, hard line opponents will be tempted increasingly to
turn to extra-parliamentary protest.
The Congress passed a resolution taking control of TV and radio into its
hands, by demanding the right to appoint supervising committees over all the
stations with the right of appointment of the chairmen and of interference
in programmes. Mr Yeltsin's main argument for his actions, underscored on
Saturday by Mr Chernomyrdin, is the 'catastrophic' state of the economy and
the need for rapid action. However, these actions will weaken his still
impressive popularity and give extra support to his opponents.
The president will be tempted, in the period to the April 25 plebiscite, to
pass measures which will increase support in him by paying out extra
beneftis.
Jurek Martin, US Editor, adds from Washington: Mr Warren Christopher, the US
secretary of state, yesterday said the US would be 'very steady' in its
support of reform in Russia, of which 'by far the best exponent is Boris
Yeltsin'.
Interviewed on TV as the Russian parliament voted on the impeachment motion,
he said Mr Yeltsin was right to have called a plebiscite.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Socialists face rout in French National Assembly election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE sweeping victory of France's conservative parties was last night
confirmed in early exit polls, which predicted they had won all but 100 of
the 577 National Assembly seats in yesterday's run-off election.
Though the turn-out appeared to be slightly higher than in the first round
last week, the outgoing Socialist government failed in its appeal to
leftwing voters and abstentionists to rally behind it to limit the size of
the centre-right landslide. In the first round 80 seats went to the
conservatives and none to the left.
The BVA polling institute gave the Socialists 68 seats, compared with the
277 which they and their minor allies had held in the last parliament. This
is only just above the threshold needed to be an effective opposition,
because a party requires 58 votes to be able to launch censure motions
against the government.
Within the centre-right coalition, the RPR Gaullists had clearly
consolidated their first round edge over their UDF partners, with the
pollsters giving the former a range of between 253 and 261 seats and the UDF
an estimated 214 to 215 seats.
President Francois Mitterrand, who will today receive the resignation of Mr
Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, is in theory free to pick the premier
of his choice. In practice, he is likely to choose from the party which has
gained most seats.
The preferred RPR candidate is Mr Edouard Balladur, its finance minister in
the last cohabitation government.
The rout of the Socialists was underlined by the defeat of Mr Roland Dumas,
who failed to keep his Dordogne seat. He is considered likely to go to the
Elysee as an adviser on foreign policy. This is expected to be one of the
contested areas of policy between the Socialist president and the victorious
conservative government.
Mr Michel Rocard, who hopes to be the Socialists' presidential candidate in
1995, had called on leftwing voters not to be demoralised by the first round
results, and to come to the ballot box to prevent the election of a
'one-legged parliament', entirely dominated by the right.
After the first round in which the combined vote of all leftwing parties was
more than 50 per cent in only 29 constituencies, leftwing voters evidently
accepted the inevitability of the conservative landslide.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Heseltine fails to calm Tory fears on pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREAT of a Tory revolt today over pit closures was re-emerging last
night as Mr Michael Heseltine failed to calm the fears of some Conservatives
that the 12 reprieved pits may not survive more than a year.
The trade and industry secretary shrugged off concern among a growing number
of Tory MPs that British Coal might scupper the hopes raised by his coal
rescue package. He said 'dramatic opportunities' had been given to the
industry via government subsidies worth Pounds 300m to Pounds 400m.
A hint from British Coal executives that further pit closures were
inevitable around April next year was, 'one hypothetical doom-laden
scenario', Mr Heseltine said on BBC television yesterday. But he admitted he
could not 'sign up in blood' to a guarantee that pits would stay open, and
indicated government subsidies would last only two years, until
privatisation.
There was comfort for Mr Heseltine, however, when it emerged the electricity
and coal industries had finally reached agreement on contracts through which
the UK's power companies would buy 160m tonnes of coal from British Coal in
the next five years. Signings are expected to be completed today.
This will secure a future for the 19 pits which British Coal considers its
best and will clear the way for talks on additional contracts aimed at
providing a lifeline for another 19 which last week were told they would
either be reprieved, mothballed or developed without being mined.
The contracts, which they have started signing after months of wrangling
within the coal and electricity industries, are worth Pounds 5.5bn to
British Coal.
In parliament, government business managers are braced for a possible
anti-government vote by at least two Conservative MPs. Another six or more
might abstain. A trade union lobby of parliament will increase the pressure
on wavering Tories but the government was last night confident of winning
the vote.
Defeat would require 11 Tories to vote against the government, if all the
other political parties were opposed to the package. The Ulster Unionists
could decide to abstain, however, making defeat still less likely.
In a move timed to help the vote, Mr Peter Lilley, social security
secretary, will today announce extra help for former miners suffering from
chronic bronchitis and emphysema, implementing recommendations last November
by the Industrial Injuries Advisory Committee.
Industry disablement benefit will be available to those suffers who have
worked more than 20 years underground.
Potential Tory rebels meet this morning to discuss tactics. The most
vociferous yesterday, Mr Winston Churchill, said he was 'looking for very
specific assurances by the chairman of British Coal' about the future of the
12 reprieved pits. Without them, 'the government would need to be very
worried about its majority', he said.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Management: When it comes to the crunch - Moves to reduce
road accidents in Brazil
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anyone who has experienced Brazilian roads and survived can appreciate why
the country holds the world record for traffic accidents. Driving licences
are more often bought than earned. The results are predictably gruesome -
55,000 deaths per year - as many as if a Boeing 737 dropped out of the sky
every day.
This daily carnage is also a costly headache for Brazilian industrialists
who rely heavily on road freight to cover the country's continental
proportions and few of whom have insurance because of its extortionate cost.
Omar Carneiro Cunha, president of Shell Brasil, says: 'We have 3,300 trucks
and cars driving millions of miles on some of the most hazardous roads in
the world, so the risks are enormous.'
As many Brazilian executives are discovering, road accidents form a large
component of business costs.
Yearly losses through traffic accidents are estimated at Dollars 1.5bn
(Pounds 1bn) and rising. Moreover, although the state of Brazilian roads is
appalling after a decade of no investment, government statistics show 85 per
cent of traffic accidents are through driver fault and thus avoidable.
An increasing number of companies is consequently including as an essential
part of restructuring, 'defensive driving programmes' for truck drivers,
(both in-house and contracted), salesforce and personnel in general with
spectacular results.
'The pay-offs are tremendous,' says Cunha, pointing out that Shell has
halved the number of avoidable fatalities per 100m km driven since launching
a road Safety programme in 1987.
The strategy is simple and costs little. At Shell, a safety department was
set up and consultants brought in to develop a short training course.
Tarcisio Mosci, who runs the programme, explains: 'However good your
hardware, there is a number of accidents caused by software so rather than
focusing on the lorries we focused on people.' A specially produced video
shows drivers the normal daily chaos on a Brazilian highway in graphic
detail, enabling them to recognise all the errors they themselves make.
'Monitor drivers' were appointed, each responsible for 30 motorists. A list
of 30 points was compiled to be checked before setting off, and all drivers
underwent eye-tests. Quality groups were created for drivers and Shell
representatives to exchange ideas, involving senior executives to
demonstrate the importance of the scheme. More than half the trucking
companies contracted by Shell were sacked because they did not come up to
scratch.
Some 800 drivers per year pass through the course, which has cut the number
of avoidable fatalities from 15.6 per 100m km driven in 1987 to 7.8 by 1991.
To improve on this, Mosci is setting up a programme focusing on speed
control and based at regional centres, aiming to reduce the figure by a
further 50 per cent by the end of next year.
The reduction in costs is considerable, given that Mosci estimates that even
under the improved figures, Shell and its contracted companies spent Dollars
10m on accident costs last year. Moreover, he adds: When you can control
risk in a situation as adverse as Brazil's traffic climate, then you have
good management in general.'
A similar programme has been under way since 1990 at Hering Textile,
Brazil's leading textiles manufacturer, reducing losses through accidents by
more than half to Dollars 50,126 a year.
Osvaldo Lopes, risk manager for Herco, the Hering Group's in-house insurers,
which developed an eight-hour programme that more than 2,000 employees have
attended, explains: 'The problem in Brazil, aside from the dreadful roads,
is that most drivers have not been taught.'
But both Lopes and Mosci admit there is a limit to how much they can achieve
in reducing accident costs without a national campaign on road safety
awareness among Brazil's 15m motorists.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Management: It takes a lot to be a superstar - Martin
Dickson considers the ambitious wish-list drawn up by IBM in its hunt for a
chief executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Call it the International Business Machines superstar wish-list.
When directors of the troubled computer company began looking for a new
chief executive last January, they spent a great deal of time discussing the
most desirable characteristics of the leader to replace Mr John Akers, who
is retiring early because of the group's poor performance.
They finally fixed on a list of 11 qualities, says Mr James Burke, the
non-executive director in charge of what turned into the most closely
watched executive hunt in American business history.
Last Friday he disclosed the contents of the list, partly to help justify
IBM's announcement that it had given the job to a man without a high
technology background - Mr Lou Gerstner, the chairman and chief executive of
food and tobacco group R J R Nabisco.
In an interview with the FT, Mr Burke pointed out that only one item on the
list referred to technology, and then with a qualification: 'Information and
high technology industry experience highly desirable, says the note, but not
averse to considering extraordinary business leaders.'
Mr Burke added that in his view IBM's problem is that 'it is not run as much
like a business as it needs to be'. In these circumstances, 'I think I would
take a highly successful, tough-minded, strategic thinking businessman ahead
of a technologist any day.
'There's all the technology . . . that they need in this company. A lot of
it gets insulated and isolated from the customers' needs, and finding a way
to bring those together is going to be a major challenge and opportunity.'
However, in spite of his remarks, industry rumours persist that several of
the other candidates on IBM's short-list, who did come from a computer
industry background, may have turned the company down before it began
serious negotiations with Mr Gerstner.
Whatever the case, controversy seems certain to rumble on for months between
those in the computer industry who think IBM's problems can be fixed by a
well-qualified general manager like Mr Gerstner, and those who believe it is
extremely hard for someone without a computer background to make the hard
choices facing IBM on technology strategy.
The computer industry is changing at phenomenal speed, with shortening
product cycles.
The technology issue apart, the other 10 items on the IBM wish-list are also
interesting for the light they shed on the company's perception of its own
weaknesses and the qualities desirable in a leader of a global business in
the 1990s.
Customer orientation is prominent on the list, which is hardly surprising,
since focusing relentlessly on customer satisfaction lies at the heart of
most modern management theories.
But it is much easier to religiously intone this piece of jargon that it is
to execute it. IBM itself has for years now been expressing a determination
to get closer to the customer, but without much success.
'This company,' says Mr Burke, 'used to be the best there was at . . .
satisfying customer needs. Its still pretty good in a lot of areas, but it's
got to be a lot better.' Mr Gerstner, as a former IBM customer himself, may
bring a new perspective to the problem.
IBM's failure to anticipate market trends sufficiently quickly prompted Mr
Akers to reorganise the business last year into more autonomous units, which
might react more nimbly to customer needs. Mr Gerstner, who has a history of
decentralisation, seems likely to accelerate the trend.
International experience. This is clearly a vital quality for the leader of
any large, multinational business such as IBM, particularly as global
markets become more and more inter-connected.
Mr Gerstner has not lived abroad in senior management positions, but he has
had plenty of international experience. As president of American Express he
ran a business which is about as omnipresent around the world as IBM.
Decisive analytical ability, creative visionary, effective and strategic
thinker. These three qualities may seem basic to success in any business but
they seem to have been in short supply at IBM as it has watched a relentless
decline in the mainframe market on which it built its computer fortunes. IBM
has been unable to articulate a clear new technological vision for itself
and execute a strategy built around this.
Mr Gerstner comes to the company with a strong reputation for analysis and
strategic thinking, but he may find it hard to articulate a creative vision
in a high tech industry which is new to him.
Unusual leader with immmediate credibility and record of business success as
a chief executive. These two qualities suggest a need to appoint an
individual with the record to reassure both the financial markets and IBM's
staff that the group is now is strong management hands.
Mr Gerstner is generally well regarded on Wall Street. While his record at R
J R is far from perfect - good on financial engineering, mixed at market
share and profits growth - American Express enjoyed good growth under his
presidency.
He is, however, virtually unknown in the computer industry and to most of
IBM's employees, whose trust he acknowledges he will have to earn.
Inspires and motivates executive teams. This is an obvious quality for a
business leader, but it may have been in short supply at IBM, with its
layers of encrusted bureaucracy. Mr Gerstner has a good reputation for
motivating his executives - both by exhortation and financial rewards. His
success at IBM will depend in no small measure on the team he selects to
advise him.
Mr Gerstner also talks to people at all levels of a company. IBM employees
often complain about the remoteness of 'the Armonk clique' of senior
management at the company's New York state headquarters. The board's
wish-list seems to lay no particular emphasis on one of the more popular
ideas in management thinking - that of 'empowering' the workforce, devolving
responsibility to workers right down the line and tapping them for their
ideas on how a business should be run. One of the most forceful exponents of
the theory is General Electric, which is often held up against lumbering IBM
as an example of how a huge, diverse and technologically complex global
business can stay quick on its feet.
Making change happen; skilled at managing change; strong preference for
experience and proven effectiveness in major turnaround or restructuring
situations requiring a cultural change.
This group of characteristics reflects the increasingly popular idea that
the best way to shake-up the entrenched culture of a business may often be
to bring in a radical 'change agent' from outside.
A prime example is General Motors, the US car group which has been brought
low by many of the same problems as IBM - in particular, bureaucracy and
complacency bred by too much past success.
Probably the most powerful single agent of cultural change at GM North
America over the past year has been Mr J Ignacio Lopez de Arriortua, an
idiosyncratic, Spanish parts purchasing manager brought to Detroit from GM's
European operations.
He infuriated the supply industry by demanding big price cuts and lecturing
companies (including GM subsidiaries) on ways to improve their manufacturing
methods. Volkswagen, the west German car company, has just hired Mr Lopez to
create a similar upheaval there.
The hard-driving Mr Gerstner has plenty of experience as a change agent, but
his record is not without flaws. His task at flabby RJR, when he took over
the helm four years ago, was to financially restructure the heavily-indebted
business, slash its fat and grow the business. He achieved the first two,
but R J R still has a host of problems, with its foods business growing
slowly and a loss of market share in tobacco.
Still, only a handful of chief executives around the world would stand a
chance of qualifying for the IBM wish-list. And if the phrase 'infallibility
essential' was added to the list, the number would immediately drop to zero.
Eleven qualities for an IBM chief executive
High tech experience
Customer orientation
International experience
Analytical ability
Creative visionary
Strategic thinker
Unusual leader with immediate credibility
Record of success as a chief executive
Inspires and motivates executive teams
Makes change happen

FT  29 MAR 93 / Economics: Markets face surfeit of news from France, Germany
and the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS week promises to be unusually busy for the time of the month.
Financial markets will be keenly anticipating clarification of the new
French government's policies as well as its membership following yesterday's
second round of the National Assembly elections.
In the US, a raft of statistics, culminating in Friday's non-farm payroll
data for March, will give new insights into the strength of the US economic
recovery and whether President Bill Clinton's deficit reduction plan has
damaged consumer confidence.
The German Bundesbank's decision-making central council holds a regular
fortnightly meeting on Thursday. Its decision late last week to cut the
interest rate on its three-day Treasury bill sharply to 7.5 per cent has
revived hopes that it may trim its official rates further in response to
signs of accelerating economic slowdown in Germany.
Behind the scenes, senior officials in the foreign and finance ministries of
the Group of Seven countries will be continuing urgent work on a support
programme for the Russian economy. The possibility of new assistance for
Russia will be raised in talks between Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin in
Vancouver next weekend.
Meanwhile, rumbling trade disputes between the US and its European Community
partners will be given a new airing in talks between Mr Mickey Kantor, the
US trade representative, and senior EC Commission officials in Brussels
today and tomorrow.
In Britain, Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton,
the Bank of England governor, will be testifying on this month's Budget to
the House of Commons Treasury and Civil Service Committee on Wednesday.
This week will see the release of important economic statistics from Japan,
Germany and, in particular, the US.
Tomorrow's March consumer confidence index in the US will be closely watched
for signs of further deterioration following the decline to 68.5 in February
from 78.1 in December. February's US factory orders on Wednesday and the
National Association of Purchasing Managers' index on Thursday will give an
insight into the state of US manufacturing.
But most attention will focus on the March employment data. Non-farm
payrolls increased by an unexpectedly strong by 365,000 in February, the
largest such rise since January 1989. Many analysts expect employment gains
will have been much slower this month. Another unexpectedly strong rise
would suggest that the economy continues to grow well and casts doubt on the
need for the expansionary elements in President Clinton's economic policy.
The main statistical releases and events are as follows. The figures in
brackets are averages of what financial markets expect, according to MMS
International, an economics consultancy.
Today: US, February new home sales (597,000), personal income (up 0.5 per
cent), personal consumption expenditure (up 0.4 per cent). Canada, January
employment earnings (up 3.2 per cent on year). Germany, InterAmerican
Development Bank meets in Hamburg.
Tomorrow: US, March consumer confidence (67.4) . Japan, February
unemployment rate. France, February unemployment rate (10.6 per cent).
Australia, January current account (ADollars 900m surplus). Canada, January
real GDP at factor cost (up 0.3 per cent on month).
Wednesday: US, February leading indicator, factory goods orders, March
Chicago NAPM. Japan, February construction orders, construction starts,
housing starts.
Thursday: Germany, Bundesbank central council meeting. US, February
construction spending (up 0.7 per cent), March NAPM index (55.0), initial
claims week ending March 27 (347,000), money supply week ending March 22 (M2
up Dollars 1bn).
Friday: US, March non-farm payrolls (up 100,000), manufacturing payrolls (up
10,000), hourly earnings (up 0.2 per cent), unemployment rate (7 per cent).
UK, March official reserves (unchanged), February housing starts. France,
National Assembly resumes.
Saturday: Canada, Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin meet in Vancouver.
During the week: Germany, February industrial production (down 1 per cent on
month), manufacturing output (down 1.3 per cent on month). Italy, February
official reserves, balance of payments.

FT  29 MAR 93 / People: McClean: 'I just love newspapers'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Richard McClean, who is due to become chief executive of the International
Herald Tribune in July, had been planning to leave the newspaper industry
this summer.
The deputy chief executive of the Financial Times, who has worked at the
paper for 38 years, had decided to retire from the business, accept a number
of non-executive directorships and take on something entirely new.
But when he was approached by the co-chairmen of the international newspaper
 -Katherine Graham of the Washington Post and Arthur Ochs Sulzberger of the
New York Times - the temptation was too great.
'I just love newspapers. That's the problem,' says McClean, 55, who joined
the FT straight from school, selling advertising from the paper's Birmingham
office. Apart from two years in the Welsh Guards, he has worked on the paper
ever since.
He will succeed Lee Huebner, who has been publisher of the IHT since June
1979, and announced his intention to leave last September.
McClean was involved in the decision to turn the FT into an international
newspaper with overseas printing sites. He believes that the process should
continue; the IHT, he points out, is probably the most widely available
international newspaper. The owners of the IHT, the New York Times and the
Washington Post, he says, are 'outstanding publishers with extensive
financial resources and a strong commitment to high-quality publications'.
And as the deputy chief executive of the FT, newspapers at the top end of
the business are something he understands.

FT  29 MAR 93 / People: Oil men move to top of Lloyd's Register
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The traditional hold of shipowners in the running of Lloyd's Register, the
world's oldest ship classification society, has been broken after more than
200 years.
Patrick O'Ferrall (right), 58, the new chairman, and Tim Jones, 48, the
deputy chairman, both hail from the oil industry. O'Ferrall joined the
register in January 1991 after 32 years in the oil industry and has been
acting chairman since the death of Sir Roderick MacLeod, a former managing
director of Ben Line, in January. Jones, who has spent 23 years with BP,
joined in February.
Although O'Ferrall says that it will be 'business as usual', the appointment
of two oil industry men with substantial international expertise suggests
that Lloyd's Register, like the rest of the maritime industry, is being
forced to adapt to increasingly competitive conditions.
The decline in the profitability of the shipping industry and competition
from rival ship classification societies has made life difficult for
Lloyd's, which is committed to maintaining high technical standards of
design. 'The days when a ship's captain saluted the Lloyd's surveyor at the
top of the gang-plank are long since gone,' one master mariner said
yesterday. Cost-conscious shipping companies are much more likely to
question the surveyor's judgment or threaten to shift their fleet to another
classification society.
Lloyd's, a non-profit making organisation with 3,700 staff and more than 250
offices worldwide, is still the biggest in the world - classifying more than
8,500 vessels, or around 90m gross tonnage. However, its percentage of the
world fleet has been slipping and it has been diversifying into other areas.
O'Ferrall started with Iraq Petroleum in 1958 and joined Total CFP in 1974;
he was responsible for co-ordinating the Pounds 1.5bn Alwyn North project.
Tim Jones, a former director of BP Oil Europe, has also had considerable
experience of large-scale project management.
Although Lloyd's normal retirement age is 62, O'Ferrall says that he will
serve a five-year term until June 1988.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WIMPEY CONSTRUCTION's northern region has been awarded a Pounds l3m contract
to design and build an office development for the Foss Development
Corporation in York.
Known as The King's Pool, the project is situated on a three acre site close
to the city centre, fronting the inner ring road and the River Foss.
When complete in autumn next year, The King's Pool will house 600
administration staff from the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries and Food
(MAFF). The civil servants will provide support services to MAFF's central
science laboratory in Sand Hutton which is currently under construction.
The department is creating 300 local jobs and relocating 300 other staff
from its offices in the south east of England to York.
Wimpey's work involves the construction of 140,000 sq ft of office
accommodation in three buildings and a three-storey car park. Wimpey will
also fit out the offices for MAFF.
Project manager for the scheme is Bishopthorpe Estates.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Peolple: Fine balance at NHS Trust
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The allocation of top jobs at Guy's and St Thomas' hospitals, which are
combining to form the biggest National Health Service trust in London, shows
a fine balance between the two ancient institutions. This follows the
appointment earlier this month of Tim Matthews, St Thomas' chief executive,
to head the new organisation.
Michael Maisey, consultant in nuclear medicine at Guy's, and Tony Young,
consultant surgeon and director of surgery at St Thomas', will jointly hold
the post of medical director on the new board.
John Pelly, finance director of St Thomas', will be the new finance
director. He worked at 3i and Rank Xerox before joining the public sector.
The post of project director goes to Karen Caines, currently general manager
of Guy's. Before taking up the Guy's job in 1991, she headed the Department
of Health implementation unit responsible for introducing the NHS reforms.
Before that Caines was deputy head of the 10 Downing Street efficiency unit
where she was co-author of proposals leading to the establishment on Next
Steps agencies, delivering services at arms-length from government.
Gabriel Scally, director of public health in Belfast, has been appointed to
a similar position with South East Thames regional health authority, one of
the four regions covering London and the home counties.

<TEXT>
The integration of the Midland and Hongkong Bank investment banking
businesses looks likely to be accelerated following the news of a new
chairman for Samuel Montagu. Bernard Asher has been appointed to the board
and will take over as chairman on April 9, succeeding Sir Michael Palliser,
the 70-year-old former permanent secretary at the Foreign Office who has
chaired Montagu since 1984.
Asher, who started out running Hongkong Bank's Wardley investment banking
business, has already pushed through mergers between some parts of Wardley
with James Capel, the UK-based broker which he has also chaired for the past
two years.
Samuel Montagu remains, legally, a subsidiary of Midland, but in management
terms now falls squarely within the HSBC group's investment banking
operation. Sir Michael is to remain on the board as vice chairman.

Environmental and engineering management consultant WALLACE EVANS has been
awarded two contracts in Sierra Leone and China with a total construction
value of Pounds 23m.
The Government of Sierra Leone has appointed Wallace Evans for the Pounds
16m improvement of a 120 km section of the Freetown to Conakry highway - the
principal link between Guinea and Sierra Leone and gateway to the
economically vital port of Freetown.
The road is part of the strategically important Trans West African Highway
that runs from Morocco in the north to Nigeria in the south.
The project includes the design for the rehabilitation of the 30km section
between Massiaka and Rogbere and the design of a new road between Pamelap on
the Guinea/Sierra Leone border and Farmoreah in Guinea.
Tender documentation for 74 km of new road between Rogbere and Pamelap, the
design of which was completed in December 1992 by Wallace Evans under an
earlier commission, is also included in the EC-funded study.
The superstructure for a Pounds 6.5m cable making factory in China is to be
designed by the Wallace Evans firm.
Construction work is due to start shortly on the 200,000 sq ft building,
located 10 miles from Bejing. The project is a joint venture between the
Chinese government and a South Korean cable and wire manufacturing company.
Wallace Evans has designed the single-storey steel superstructure to
withstand earthquakes. Staff undertook a detailed study of Chinese
regulations, which took account of the climatic regional variations,
followed by complex computer calculations to assess the stress the building
would need to withstand.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Power deals offer lifeline: Contracts worth Pounds 5.5bn to
British Coal pave way to talks on pits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ELECTRICITY and coal industries yesterday cleared the way for
negotiations aimed at saving threatened pits when they started signing
contracts worth Pounds 5.5bn over five years to British Coal.
The deals, concluded after nearly a year of intense negotiations just three
days before existing three-year contracts expire, will secure a long-term
future for the 19 pits which British Coal regards as its best.
However, the future of a further 19 which will either stay open or be
mothballed following last week's white paper will be determined by talks
likely to begin within the next few weeks between British Coal and the
generators.
The 'core contracts' commit the generators to buying 160m tonnes of coal
over five years, and the regional companies to buying the electricity
generated from that.
The signings started yesterday afternoon and were expected to be concluded
either late last night or this morning. Announcements were expected to be
made to the Stock Exchange this morning.
Only one of the 12 regional companies did not participate yesterday -
Eastern Electric signed deals with the generators for coal-fired electricity
earlier this year.
Yesterday's signings were concluded in a flurry of activity with the
executives of some companies being driven around London to perform their
roles in locations including offices, hotels and solicitors' offices.
Legal advisers had been up until 5am on Sunday sorting out the fine print.
'It was like the final stages of buying a house,' said one regional
electricity company executive.
An executive of one of the generators said that although most of the
contracts included confidentiality clauses, most regional companies had been
comparing notes and this had resulted in last-minute requests for changes.
The contracts have been expected on numerous occasions since last autumn,
but new problems constantly arose whenever deals looked close.
The government last week blamed the delays for the failure of the generators
and British Coal to agree contracts for additional tonnages which will save
the 12 reprieved pits.
The negotiations on the additional tonnages are likely to be similarly
fraught.
Outstanding issues include the level of subsidy the government pays to
enable British Coal to offer its output at world prices.
The duration of the subsidies will also be crucial. Although the generators
had previously indicated that they will be able to take up to 40m tonnes
over five years, that was based on the assumption that subsidies would last
five years and not the two to three years the government now intends before
privatisation of British Coal goes ahead.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Troubled Scots pit restarts production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONKTONHALL, the Edinburgh colliery leased from British Coal by a miners'
consortium, was due to resume production last night after losing two days'
output after the death of a miner on Saturday.
The accident at the coalface was a further setback to the pit which is in
serious financial difficulties. On Friday the 160 miners received their
first week's pay for after working without pay for eight weeks.
The miner, Mr William Gorman, 35, was killed when part of the roof collapsed
at the colliery's only coalface. He had joined the Monktonhall Mineworkers
consortium nine weeks ago by subscribing Pounds 10,000 to buy his stake in
the company.
An inspector from the mines inspectorate of the government's Health and
Safety Executive is investigating the accident, the first since the mine was
reopened last summer.
The consortium has debts of more than Pounds 1.6m and Bank of Scotland has
refused to advance more cash.
At the end of last month the consortium appealed for a partner to inject new
capital to keep going but later turned down an offer from Caledonian Mining,
an English company which wanted to take a controlling stake.
Although Monktonhall has orders from British Coal and ScottishPower, it
incurred debts because of a three-month delay in resuming production at the
pit at the end of 1992.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Good-humoured accountant in charge of sell-off numbers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR RAY Proctor occasionally has to field a joke among his executive
colleagues at British Coal over the book he wrote about finance.
Called Finance for the Perplexed Executive, it is 'an attempt to interest
people in accountancy with a modicum of humour', he says.
Mr Proctor will need to use all the good humour he has at his disposal as he
grapples over the next few years with the intricacies, financial and
otherwise, of British Coal's privatisation.
The government is expected to announce within the next few weeks that it has
chosen him to fill the role it announced in last week's white paper for a
British Coal board member with special responsibility for privatisation.
He is also likely to take over as finance director from Mr Michael Butler,
who is to step down from the job at the end of this month.
Mr Proctor yesterday had no comment on what he called speculation over his
appointment, although ministers have already indicated that the job is his.
As board director with responsibility for privatisation, Mr Proctor would
deal with the list of more than 20 private-sector companies that have
expressed interest in mining under licence or buying the 19 pits which
British Coal said last week it would close or mothball.
He would then be expected to advise the government on its legislation to
sell the whole company to the private sector and the price that should be
asked.
Such an influential role would be an early reward for a man who has only
been on the British Coal executive, a body next down the line from the
board, for a year.
Appointed to the executive because the board felt it needed a stronger
presence from the opencast operation which he headed, Mr Proctor was - after
the death of Dr Kenneth Moses, deputy director - asked to head the
privatisation operation in a less senior role than the government now
envisages for him.
He was also influential in British Coal's response to the government's and
parliament's coal inquiries, co-ordinating for example the corporation's
submission to the trade and industry committee.
Like most of the executive and board members at British Coal, Mr Proctor,
47, has spent virtually all his adult working life at the corporation.
He joined as a management trainee after attending Hertford College, Oxford,
and qualified as an accountant shortly afterwards.
Mr Proctor, who speaks with a slow Yorkshire accent, is shares a keenness
for privatisation with most of the other British Coal executives. But he is
not a man who verbalises his enthusiasm.
'The government has decided it is going to happen,' he said recently, 'and
it is our job to make sure it happens in the most effective way.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / TUC issues alternative to the government's White Paper
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Trades Union Congress yesterday issued an alternative to the
government's white paper on coal as it prepared for a march and lobby of
parliament to coincide with today's debate on the government's coal
strategy.
It dismissed the white paper as a 'contemptuous political fix' which failed
to tackle the main problem which it said was the rigging of the power
generation market against coal.
The alternative white paper, No Prospects For Coal, predicts that on top of
the 18 pits which will close or be mothballed immediately, a further four
will close after a year with 5,000 job losses and a further eight in two
years, with 8,000 job losses. Selling off the pits no longer wanted by
British Coal would not tackle the issue, the TUC said.
'Without any market prospects they will have to close by the end of the
year.'
The Coalfield Communities Campaign pressure group also criticised the white
paper, saying that the government was proposing a framework that 'even in
the short run would allow a maximum of only seven of the threatened pits to
survive'.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Coal mountain may bury hopes: Improved productivity has only
added to the problems of saving mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL CLARKE, British Coal chairman, may already be roughing out in his
mind the statement he is likely to issue in six to 12 months' time to close
some of the pits reprieved last week.
The form of words could be along the lines of: 'It is with deep sadness and
regret that I have to announce that the market-testing exercise we have
carried out since March has failed to find the 15m additional tonnes we
need. It has not been possible to secure a market for x of them and we have
no alternative but to close them.'
The x is likely to be less than the 12 pits reprieved on Thursday. But
unless the energy market changes beyond all expectations, further closure
announcements are inevitable within a year. More will follow.
In addition Mr Clarke may soon sound the death knell for some of the six
pits which British Coal said this week would be mothballed. The ostensible
reason for holding back on closing them last week was to see the outcome of
the market-testing.
But with British Coal executives already admitting they will struggle to
find a market even for the reprieved mines, the corporation will eventually
have to give up on some of the mothballed pits. The financial incentive for
doing so sooner rather than later is that it will cost between Pounds 2m and
Pounds 4m a year for each mothballed pit.
British Coal's problems in keeping open the 12 reprieved pits, and providing
a realistic lifeline to the six which are mothballed, stem from a
combination of a rapidly declining market at a time of impressive
improvements in productivity.
The fact is that the 19 pits which British Coal considers its best - those
it intended to keep open even under the original plans announced in October
to close 31 other pits - can produce more than enough coal to fulfil the
corporation's contractual obligations to supply 40m tonnes to the
electricity generators in the year from April 1 as well as supply other
industrial and household markets.
But the 12 reprieved pits alone will have produced nearly 13m tonnes of coal
in this financial year. Given productivity improvements of around 20 per
cent a year, that could rise to more than 15m tonnes next year. Finding a
market for all of that would be a tall order in itself - but in 1994-95 the
problems worsen significantly.
That is because the long-term contracts with the electricity generators
envisage a 25 per cent reduction in tonnages, from 40m tonnes in 1993-94 to
30m tones in 1994-95. Put simply, British Coal will have to sell 25m tonnes
above what it is already contracted for in 1994-95, nearly as much again as
it has contracts for with electricity companies.
This will come at a time when some of the gas-fired power stations, being
built by partnerships involving regional electricity companies, and the
Sizewell B nuclear station come on stream and crowd the market further.
The generators are expressing their willingness to talk to British Coal
about additional sales but few in either the electricity or the coal
industries believe the contracts they are likely to sign will fill all of
the gap between supply from 31 pits and demand.
Most feel that British Coal will struggle to sell much more than 10m tonnes
a year. Nor will the deals come easily. 'We are talking months of talks
rather then weeks,' said one electricity company executive.
British Coal executives are talking optimistically about using the subsidies
to tap into niche industrial markets where they have previously been denied
access because of the buyers' preferences for cheaper imports. The
corporation may even to try to supply British Steel with some of the 8m
tonnes of specialist coking coal it requires a year, virtually all of which
is now imported.
In the meantime, the delays in closing and mothballing pits will add to
British Coal's already overburdened stockpiles. Last December the High Court
ruled it had acted illegally when it announced plans in October to close 10
pits immediately because it had failed to consult widely enough.
That places an onus on the corporation to act less hastily this time, and it
will be several weeks before production stops at the two doomed mines and
six which are to be mothballed. These together mine 250,000 tonnes a week,
and a similar amount will come from the 12 reprieved pits, for which there
is not yet a market.
All of this additional coal - up to 2m tonnes a month worth Pounds 72m -
will go straight on to stockpiles, which at 11m tonnes are already far
higher than the corporation wants. Unless it is prepared to keep stocks
artificially high for years to come, this will add to the pressure for
closures.
The government is stressing that collieries which are not viable under
British Coal may thrive in the private sector which will also be offered
subsidies. However, coal industry analysts believe there is room in the
market for little more than half a dozen private-sector pits, and potential
buyers will take their pick from the 12 closing almost immediately.
Not surprisingly the mood among British Coal employees was sombre this
weekend. Referring to prospects for the saving all reprieved 12 pits, one
executive said yesterday: 'It's like trying to push a bus up Crystal Palace
Hill.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Gas engineers fear loss of 30,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GAS ENGINEERING companies could see the loss of 30,000 jobs by the end of
the year because of the uncertainty hanging over the industry, the president
of the Society of British Gas Industries warned yesterday.
More than 200 engineering and service companies which supply British Gas
with pipes, valves, meters and other infrastructure have shed more than
10,000 jobs between them since the start of the year as British Gas has cut
back on investment, Mr John Cull, society president and managing director of
Amec Utilities, told the Financial Times.
The society represents about 90 per cent of the engineering and service
companies supplying British Gas.
Mr Cull said that British Gas has cut its Pounds 300m investment programme
by 20 per cent this year because of uncertainty over the outcome of the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry into its business.
The inquiry should set a rate of return for British Gas's pipelines business
as well as determine whether it should be sold off, Mr Cull said. Ofgas, the
industry regulator, has proposed that British Gas should earn a return of
between 2 per cent and 4.5 per cent on its pipelines. But the company says
this is far too low to encourage ongoing investment in infrastructure.
Mr Cull said that manufacturing throughput among the society's members has
declined by 60 per cent compared with the same time last year. He believes
that British Gas is running down its stocks of pipes and not ordering new
ones.
Service companies working under contract to British Gas, for example laying
pipes, were seeing a fall of between 30 per cent and 50 per cent in turnover
from the same period last year, Mr Cull said.
'This is forcing our members to contract - several companies have closed
additional sites and pulled business back to one location. Several have
merged and some are facing receivership,' he added.
'These companies are well-managed, but they're suffering because of the
battle between British Gas and Ofgas. In this battle we're the only
sol-diers getting killed.'
Mr Cull has met Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, to express his worries
about the industry. But Mr Eggar said the matter remains in the hands of the
commission.
The commission's report is due out by the end of April, but Mr Cull fears
that the government will not take decisive action on it until close to the
end of the year.
By that time, he believes, service companies which rely on British Gas as
their main customer will be facing severe difficulties.
Once the commission's report has been published, Mr Cull believes it will
take another year before levels of investment are restored.
'By this time, there will be very little left of what was once a healthy and
technically advanced industry with a very strong skills base,' he said.
Mr Cull met Sir James McKinnon, director-general of Ofgas, earlier this year
to warn him of the problems in the gas supply industry.
Mr Cull warned: 'The government is just watching while this industry tumbles
apart.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / MMC urged to open household supply market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DEBORAH HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MONOPOLIES and Mergers Commission is considering a call from British
Gas's competitors for the liberalisation of the household gas supply market
in its review of the industry. But this is countered by consumer groups and
some North Sea oil producers who urge caution in changing the present
structure.
In a Financial Times survey of evidence to the commission which is due to
present its report to Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, on
April 30, all of British Gas's main competitors say they want to enter
household sales.
Many of the regional electricity companies - most of which have set up gas
supply arms - are eager to enter the market, but other competitors want a
phased introduction of competition.
Mr Alan Marshall, managing director of Agas, suggests a system under which
the supply contracts for British Gas's 92 districts are franchised to
companies.
Most of the gas marketing companies believe it is not necessary to break up
British Gas as Sir James McKinnon, the regulator, proposes. But 13 of the 25
main competitors have told the commission that the company's pipelines
should be sold. British Gas has suggested hiving off pipelines to a separate
subsidiary under its ownership, but this does not go far enough for many
competitors. 'We will never be sure that we are paying the same tariffs for
transporting our gas along British Gas's pipelines until they are under
separate ownership,' said the head of gas sales at one of the regional
electricity companies.
But other companies such as United Gas, which has supply deals with six
regional electricity companies, is urging the commission to decide whether
to remove British Gas's mono-poly over domestic sales before it addresses
structural changes in the market.
Consumer groups such as the Gas Consumers' Council remain sceptical of the
benefits from breaking up British Gas and from introducing competition to
household sales. The council has told the commission that, while it supports
the principle of consumer choice, its view is that 'the domestic gas
consumer is well-served by a privatised public gas monopoly in a regulatory
system'.
Similarly, the Major Energy Users' Council, which represents large
industrial consumers, said: 'The market is too large, too complex, too
important to all of us to have academic solutions thrust down our throats.'
This is a view supported by some North Sea oil and gas producers such as
Shell who value the strong purchasing power British Gas has wielded in North
Sea gas fields.
Other competitors urge caution. 'The domestic market must open up, but we've
got to talk through the issues raised about supply obligations and safety,'
said Mr Norman Ellis, managing director of Kinetica.
British Gas has argued strongly against opening up the household supply
market, claiming that prices would rise rather than fall.
It is for the commission to weigh up the arguments for and against
liberalising the household supply market and then the government will decide
whether to follow its advice. But if it decides against opening up the
market, many suppliers will be disappointed.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Managers' pay rises slow but beat inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS' basic pay comfortably outstripped inflation in the 12 months to
February but the trend of the settlements fell in the course of the year, a
survey of more than 1,000 companies has found.
The survey by pay research group Reward found that basic pay rose by 4.4 per
cent in the year, compared with a 1.8 per cent rise in the retail prices
index, but that six months ago pay was rising at an annual rate of more than
5.5 per cent.
Mr Steve Flather, Reward managing director, said that pay rises were
responding to the drop in inflation. 'But these results also suggest that
those organisations which are surviving the tough times of the recession are
giving above-inflation increases to ensure that they retain their key
staff,' he said.
Few managers have swapped their company cars for cash, Reward found. Among
senior managers, 81.6 per cent now receive cars, compared with 82.3 per cent
in March 1992. The figure for middle managers has risen from 37.9 per cent
in 1992 to 39.6 per cent. Among junior managers, 20.2 per cent have cars,
compared with 19.8 per cent last year.
Last year's graduate recruits earn a little more than the current batch of
entrants to the jobs market, according to Reward. The average graduate
starting salary is Pounds 12,750, with a range of Pounds 11,720 to Pounds
14,000. Last year's graduates have an average salary of Pounds 12,800, with
a range of Pounds 11,750 to Pounds 14,000.

FT  29 MAR 93 / County elections battle starts early
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPENING shots in this year's local elections will be fired today when
Labour launches its campaign with a fresh assault on the impact of the
government's economic policies and approach to local spending. Mrs Margaret
Beckett, the party's deputy leader, and Mr Jack Straw, the shadow
environment secretary, will lead the attack.
For the Conservatives, the campaign will begin on Wednesday with the first
of a series of London press conferences led by Sir Norman Fowler, the party
chairman, and Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary.
Only the Liberal Democrats are holding their fire until the middle of next
month.
The early start and extended campaigns planned by both main parties for the
county council elections on May 6 shows how seriously they are being taken.
This contrasts with the approach to last year's local elections, when the
parties recognised that electors were suffering 'voter fatigue' after the
general election, and to the last county elections in 1989, when the
politicians were looking ahead to the European parliament elections.
This time much higher profile campaigns are planned for what will be the
first large-scale test of political opinion since April last year. Millions
of voters will be electing some 3,500 councillors for the 47 counties in
England and Wales.
The main themes of Labour's campaign will be the economic impact of
government policy in particular areas, for example the numbers of jobs lost
or homes repossessed, and the effect of the tight control on public spending
on local services. In spite of the relatively easy introduction so far of
the council tax, party strategists have concluded that it is still worth
focusing on how the replacement for the poll tax might be improved.
The thrust of the Conservatives' campaign will be the value for money
provided by Tory councils. County councils spend most of the Pounds
50bn-plus spent by local authorities in England and Wales, and the Tories
will be developing the line that, apart from people's mortgages, the biggest
'purchasing decision' most families will take this year will be who they
want to run the county council.
Even though the government has faced strong criticism for centralising
powers in some policy areas previously the preserve of councils, such as
education, the party organisation is confident that these will still be
valuable campaigning issues.
The same is true of the police reforms announced this month by Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the home secretary. Although they will reduce the responsibility of
local councillors for the police service, tacticians at party headquarters
believe they received a good enough reception to enable the Tories to
highlight law and order.
In general, the Liberal Democrats will focus on education and the
environment. In the south-west, especially Cornwall, where much of their
effort will be directed they will also concentrate on unemployment.
All three parties are cautious about their prospects. The talk is more of
'consolidation' than of sweeping gains. After the 1989 elections there were
19 counties controlled by Conservatives, 12 by Labour, one by Liberal
Democrats, three by independents and 12 were under no overall control.
Labour will be targeting Leicestershire and Northamptonshire, where it is
the second largest party, and Cheshire where it is the largest single party.
It is also looking to improve its hold in Lancashire where it has a small
overall majority. Lancashire is one of the four counties where it took
control in 1989.
Apart from the south-west, the Liberal Democrats will concentrate on the
Home Counties, especially Berkshire, combining the county campaign with that
for the Newbury parliamentary by-election, which could be on the same day.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Compromise plan for BR pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A COMPROMISE plan that would head off Conservative MPs' concerns over
British Rail pensioners when the industry is privatised is being given
serious consideration by Mr John MacGregor, the transport secretary.
Mr Stephen Milligan, the Conservative MP for Eastleigh, Hampshire, who has
2,000 BR pensioners in his constituency, said the scheme proposed by British
Rail pension trustees was emerging as a 'front-runner'.
BR's board of directors has expressed fierce opposition to the government's
plans. Problems have arisen over the two options originally envisaged by the
government - either transferring the portion of the BR Pounds 8.5bn pension
fund corresponding to existing pensioners to the Treasury, or transferring
the portion to a new pension fund.
Several Conservatives were worried that the pensioners would get only
minimal increases in pensions from the Treasury, while an independent fund
without any contributors would have to take an exceptionally cautious
investment stance - again meaning that rises in pensions would be limited.
Under the compromise scheme, backed by Mr Milligan, a new pension fund would
be set up to include existing British Rail pensioners, 'deferred' pensioners
who have left the company, and those who continue working for BR Residual -
the part of BR that will remain in the private sector. That would guarantee
an income flow to the pension fund for at least five to 10 years.
Mr MacGregor has ordered a consultation period on the proposals which will
last until May, but colleagues have confirmed that the compromise plan is
receiving detailed attention at the department.
The results of the consultations are expected to coincide with the Commons'
report stage on BR privatisation.

Kern, chief economist at National Westminster Bank, predicts.
He expects the jobless total to rise by a further 300,000 to 3.275m in March
next year.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S attitude to electoral reform will be the single most important
litmus test of its views on modernising Britain, Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal
Democrat leader, said yesterday.
His comments came ahead of the publication, expected this week, of Labour's
report on electoral reform, which is believed to favour a form of
proportional representation.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NIGEL Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesman, has asked the
Office of Fair Trading for an investigation into what he claims is
supermarket 'profiteering'.
In a letter to Sir Bryan Carsberg, the director-general of fair trading, Mr
Griffiths produces statistics showing that supermarket profits have risen by
422 per cent over 10 years while farm-gate prices have risen by only 18 per
cent.
He contrasts the UK supermarkets' profit increases with those in France.
Carrefour, the largest French supermarket group, increased its profits by
only 76 per cent over the previous 10 years, he points out. According to Mr
Griffiths, gross margins for French supermarkets are around 18 per cent,
compared with 23 per cent for UK market leaders.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Waste contractors gain ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATE CONTRACTORS are winning an increasing share of council contracts for
refuse collection and street cleaning, a survey published today of
contracting out in waste management services shows.
The Institute of Public Finance, a research arm of the Chartered Institute
of Public Finance and Accountancy, says the survey found that private
companies have won more than two thirds of the refuse-collection contracts
put out to tender by councils since January last year, against competition
from council workforces. Private contractors now operate contracts worth
almost Pounds 150m a year in total - 24 per cent of the market.
The shift towards using private contractors looks set to continue, the
survey found. Contracts for refuse collection worth Pounds 170m will be
going out to tender over the next 18 months as the contracts in the first
generation of tendering come up for renewal.
Conservative councils are much more likely to award contracts to the private
sector than Labour-controlled councils. More than half the waste-management
work of private contractors comes from Conservative-controlled councils,
with only 7 per cent from Labour authorities.
The survey covers 97 per cent of the refuse collection and street-cleaning
work which must be put out to tender. It is the first of a series analysing
compulsory competitive tendering sector by sector.
Of the 457 refuse-collection contracts in the survey, 117 went to private
companies, including six to local authority management buyouts.
The survey shows that the proportion of new contracts won by the private
sector has been steadily rising, from less than a quarter in the earliest
days of compulsory tendering to 68 per cent for contracts since January last
year.
The private sector has been less successful in winning street-cleaning
contracts, which 288 local authorities put out to tender separately from
refuse collection. Less than a fifth have gone to private contractors, and
these are worth just 15 per cent of the Pounds 210m-a-year market.
Since January last year, the private sector has won a 28 per cent share of
street-cleaning contracts put out to tender. Another Pounds 85m of contracts
is due to be retendered over the next 18 months.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Ethnic groups' disparity widens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN increasing disparity is emerging between the circumstances of ethnic
minority groups, the Policy Studies Institute says today.
Its research, based on a study of the Department of Employment's labour
force survey, says a complex pattern now exists which 'can no longer be
adequately summarised by a simple contrast between relatively well-off
'whites' and poorly-off 'blacks'.'
The report says that members of the African-Asian and Indian communities
have higher proportions of well-qualified people, have attained comparable
job status with whites, and have unemployment rates closest to those of the
majority population. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Pakistanis and
Bangladeshis have the largest proportions of people without formal
qualifications and consistently suffer the highest jobless rates.
Afro-Caribbean people tended to be in a more complex position between these
two extremes. But, concludes the report, it was clear that general
circumstances had changed little for people of Afro-Caribbean, Pakistani and
Bangladeshi origin over the past 10 years. They remained concentrated in
lower-level jobs, and were subject to much higher rates of unemployment than
other ethnic groups.
Research suggested that levels of racial discrimination in the mid 1980s
were similar to those of the mid 1970s, it says.

FT  29 MAR 93 / 'Few' councils to be capped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Howard, environment secretary, yesterday said he would cap the
spending of 'very few' local authorities in the first year of the new
council tax, which starts this week.
Only three councils have breached spending criteria set by his department,
Mr Howard confirmed.
An announcement on capping is expected next month.
Speaking on BBC television, Mr Howard admitted that the new council tax,
based on property values, would disadvantage those with higher-valued
houses.
'There is no way in which you can introduce a system of paying for local
services that is all advantage and no disadvantage,' he said.
But he said the new tax - unlike its predecessor, the poll tax - was
becoming accepted.
The government had an election mandate to control all public spending - and
therefore it was right for him to have capping powers, Mr Howard said.
He added: 'We will actually have to cap very few local authorities indeed. .
. This year, all but three local authorities have virtually kept within
limits that we have set out.'
The equivalent of seven out of 10 adults in London have been summonsed for
non-ayment of the poll tax in the past three years, the Labour-dominated
Association of London Authorities says today.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Sex-case tribunals may curb publicity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIAL TRIBUNALS are to be given the power to restrict press reporting
of sexual harassment cases, following a late government amendment to the
employment bill, which is going through the House of Lords.
The amendment, due to be tabled today, is certain to be accepted. It will
prevent either alleged victims or alleged harassers from being identified
while a case is being heard. The measure could also be extended to
protecting witnesses.
The Equal Opportunities Commission has been arguing for some time that many
women are put off from bringing harassment cases because of what is seen as
sensationalised reporting by the tabloid press of the evidence. It knows of
cases where women have received hate mail and have even been attacked after
their addresses have been published.
Any reporting restrictions imposed will last only until a tribunal reaches
its final judgment, unless the case involves allegations of indecent assault
or rape, when protection for the alleged victim would last for life.
Judge Timothy Lawrence, president of the industrial tribunals in England and
Wales, wrote to the government last year to express his concern about the
lack of protection for sexual harassment cases. Other bodies, including
community law centres, have also put forward evidence of distress and
embarrassment caused by the reporting of tribunals.
Hammersmith and Fulham Community Law Centre in London wrote to the
Department of Employment: 'It is our experience that many clients simply do
not make applications to the industrial tribunal because of their anxiety
about the hearing.
'In many of the cases that we deal with, the woman has never spoken about
her experiences before, and even discussing the harassment in private
presents difficulties . . . It is our view that any steps which could be
taken to increase the privacy of the hearing would encourage applicants to
proceed with their claims.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / French fishermen warned after seizing boat
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID CURRY, fisheries minister, last night warned French fishermen that
they face a strong reaction from the Royal Navy if their 'provocation' over
British fish exports continues.
His warning followed an incident in Cherbourg harbour when French fishermen
seized HMS Blazer, a Royal Navy patrol boat, for three hours and another
incident in which officers from a British vessel were abducted at sea aboard
a French trawler.
Mr Curry said on BBC radio: 'The first thing I will be doing is to review
the operating instructions we give to the Navy and consider whether or not
we should give them instructions to use a higher degree of force if
necessary.'
He added: 'The next time the French are going to meet with something just a
little bit more severe than they did this time.'
HMS Blazer was on a goodwill visit to Cherbourg when French fishing vessels
hemmed it in against a jetty and it was boarded by fishermen who burnt her
white ensign. On board were a crew of six, plus a Royal Naval Reserve
training officer and nine students from Southampton University. The Foreign
Office said the French authorities had brought the incident to an end last
night and the fishermen had left the ship.
Mr Henry Feral, Cherbourg's vice-prefect, called the protest 'inadmissible'
and said the incident had been 'particularly serious' to Anglo-French
relations.
In an earlier incident, fisheries protection officers from HMS Brocklesby
boarded La Calypso, a French trawler, off Alderney in the Channel Islands
after it was suspected of illegal fishing under EC rules. The French vessel
ignored orders to head for Guernsey and made for Cherbourg with three of the
boarding party still aboard.
The men were not given the chance to leave, although they were not
threatened with any violence, the UK fisheries ministry said. HMS Brocklesby
chased the trawler as far as French waters. The MoD said: 'It was decided
not to use force to stop the boat because obviously we didn't wish to
endanger life and limb.'
La Calypso took the three officers to Cherbourg where a French pilot boat
took them back to HMS Brocklesby.
British diplomats in Paris will raise both incidents with the French
Ministry of Sea tomorrow.
French and British vessels fished in Channel Islands waters until last
September when the EC recognised a British six-mile limit around the
islands. EC fishing regulations give fisheries officials the right to order
foreign vessels suspected of fishing in British waters to put into a British
port.
The incidents come at a time of renewed tension between French and British
fishermen. French fishermen have attacked British exports of fish and
shellfish or denied them access to French ports. They are angry because the
fall in the pound means British fish undercuts French prices.
Earlier in the weekend French fishermen warned their English counterparts to
stay away from French ports. British fishermen landing catches would do so
'at their own peril', Mr Jean le Boucher, leader of the French fishermen in
lower Normandy, said.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Ministers look at ways to cut invalidity cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOCIAL SECURITY ministers are looking at ways of cutting the more than
Pounds 5bn a year spent on invalidity benefit as part of this year's
White-hall spending negotiations - making it a likely first casualty of the
government's fundamental review of public spending.
Invalidity benefit claimants have more than doubled since 1979 to 1.38m, and
the Department of Social Security suspects that the actual number of people
unable to work through illness has not risen in proportion.
Options include taxing the benefit, ending or restricting its availability
to people above the retirement age, or tightening further the qualification
procedures. Taxation of invalidity benefit has already been hinted at by the
government.
Mr Michael Portillo, the chief secretary to the Treasury, is keeping
pressure on spending ministers and has said that the first results of the
public expenditure review will be available this summer, in time to have an
impact on spending from April 1994.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, has called a 'brain-storming'
weekend summit of his ministerial team next month for a strategic review of
his department's work.
He plans a series of briefing papers on the benefit system, including the
impact of demographic changes on their costs, in order to prepare the ground
for possible policy changes after the next general election.
The spending review could see a further substantial shift towards
individuals 'opting out' of the state benefit system and making private
provision.
The Treasury yesterday did not rule out the possibility of its Pounds 254bn
'control total' for spending in 1994-95 being lowered during this year's
negotiations.
Meanwhile, Labour also appears to be moving towards backing radical changes
to the welfare state.
Mr Donald Dewar, Labour's social security spokesman, warned a weekend
conference in London that the problem of pensioner poverty could not be
tackled by raising the basic state retirement pension.
He pointed out that almost 70 per cent of people now retiring had an
occupational pension worth, on average, the same as the state retirement
pension. And an increasing number retired with a state earnings-related
pension.
If the state retirement pension remained pegged to prices, it would continue
to fall as a percentage of average earnings, he said. Even to hold it at its
present level in relation to average earnings would be very costly.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Managers' pay rises slow but beat inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS and JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS' basic pay comfortably outstripped inflation in the 12 months to
February but the trend of the settlements fell in the course of the year, a
survey of more than 1,000 companies has found.
The survey by pay research group Reward found that basic pay rose by 4.4 per
cent in the year, compared with a 1.8 per cent rise in the retail prices
index, but that six months ago pay was rising at an annual rate of more than
5.5 per cent.
Another survey published today also shows that average pay increases are
falling but are still more than double the rate of inflation.
Increases averaged 4.2 per cent in the quarter to the start of January, the
latest Hay Compensation report says.
However, the quarterly study of pay awards among 573 large and medium-sized
UK organisations covering 188,000 jobs in the management and clerical
sectors says deals averaged 6 per cent in the same period of the previous
year. The downward trend is further reflected in the annual figures, which
averaged 5.6 per cent over the 12 months to the beginning of January
compared with 9 per cent in 1991.
Mr Steve Flather, Reward managing director, said that pay rises were
responding to the drop in inflation. 'But these results also suggest that
those organisations which are surviving the tough times of the recession are
giving above-inflation increases to ensure that they retain their key
staff,' he said.
Few managers have swapped their company cars for cash, Reward found. Indeed,
with the exception of senior managers, the percentage of managers with cars
has risen slightly. Among senior managers, 81.6 per cent now receive cars,
compared with 82.3 per cent in March 1992. The figure for middle managers
has risen from 37.9 per cent in 1992 to 39.6 per cent. Among junior
managers, 20.2 per cent have cars, compared with 19.8 per cent last year.
Last year's graduate recruits earn a little more than the current batch of
entrants to the jobs market, according to Reward. The average graduate
starting salary is Pounds 12,750, with a range of Pounds 11,720 to Pounds
14,000. Last year's graduates have an average salary of Pounds 12,800, with
a range of Pounds 11,750 to Pounds 14,000.
The Hay study found that average pay increases in the latest quarter were
highest for top management at 5.6 per cent (5.9 per cent for the year) and
lowest for middle management at 3.6 per cent (5.7 per cent for the year).
Clerical staff averaged 4.2 per cent for the quarter but recorded the lowest
annual average increase at 5.4 per cent.
The Hay study expects average salary increases to remain at about 4 per cent
over the next 12 months, although top management is expected to receive
average increases of 4.7 per cent.

THE Palestinians will delay a decision on whether to attend the next round
of Middle East peace talks until April 8, Mr Yassir Arafat, chairman of the
Palestine Liberation Organisation, announced yesterday.
Mr Arafat told the Middle East News Agency in Cairo that he would be asking
President Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian leader, to explain the Palestinian
position when he meets President Bill Clinton in Washington on April 6.
Mr Mubarak will visit Germany and Britain this week before heading off to
the US. On Saturday he held talks in Cairo with President Hafez al-Assad of
Syria in an effort to reach a joint Arab response to the American invitation
to resume peace negotiations in Washington on April 20.
The foreign ministers of Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt and the PLO also met
in Damascus yesterday to consider the US invitation. But Mr Arafat said the
PLO executive committee wanted an opportunity to assess the result of
current talks in Washington between members of the Palestinian peace talks
delegation and US officials before reaching a final decision.
The Palestinians have so far declined to accept the US invitation without an
assurance from Israel that it will stop mass deportation of people from the
occupied territories. The demand stemmed from Israel's deportation of 415
Palestinians on December 17.
The Israeli army said it would bar the 750,000 Palestinians living in
occupied Gaza from entering Israel for an indefinite period in response to a
recent upsurge in Israeli-Arab violence, Reuter reports from Jerusalem.
Earlier, military officials said two Palestinians had stabbed to death a Jew
and Israeli troops shot dead an Arab in Gaza.
It is the second time Gaza has been closed since the deportations in
December.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Jiang ascends the triple throne: Beijing is again engaged in
delicate transition from one generation of leaders to the next
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLING west from the vast Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing along
Chang An ('Heavenly Peace') boulevard, you pass on your right huge, studded
vermilion gates flanked by a pair of heavy, stone imperial lions.
The masses do not dawdle outside these gates, since they would be waved away
by smartly attired honour guards of the People's Liberation Army, who snap
to attention as black limousines, their windows heavily tinted to hide the
identities of the occupants, slide back and forth into the traffic, guided
by police outriders.
This is the entrance to the ZhongNan Hai (Middle and South Lakes) compound
of the Chinese leadership from where the destiny of one-fifth of mankind is
guided and where momentous decisions have been taken that have literally
rocked the world, including the order in June 1989 to the army to put down
pro-democracy protests in Tiananmen square just a few hundred metres to the
east.
These days, as winter turns to spring in the Chinese capital, things appear
relatively calm, although beneath the surface, unease persists; not so much,
one suspects, because of lingering animus about the events of June 4, but
because China is once again engaged in a delicate transition from one
generation of leaders to the next.
For the moment, hopes of a smooth transition have been vested in a
leadership group that includes Mr Li Peng, the Premier, and Mr Jiang Zemin,
the apparently affable Communist Party boss, Chairman of the Central
Military Commission and now President, or head of state.
Not since Mao Zedong dominated state and party institutions in the 1950s has
one man, apart from the briefly-anointed Hua Guofeng (there was no position
of president when he served as premier and party boss in the 1970s and early
1980s) had the three roles of head of party, state and military.
Thus, the 67-year-old Mr Jiang at the weekend attained a trio of leadership
positions that will nominally place him at the very pinnacle of authority in
the world's most populous country. As he contemplates his bounty from the
high-walled seclusion of the ZhongNan Hai compound, Mr Jiang probably cannot
quite believe his good fortune.
Nor, it must be said, can many Chinese and foreign observers who are not
persuaded that he is of the 'right stuff' to guide his country further into
uncharted waters: from a centrally-planned state under rigid communist party
diktat to a modernising market-oriented economy under looser central
control.
Indeed, the fact that he needs to accumulate, or have thrust upon him,
responsibilities for the party, state and army is seen not as a sign of
strength, but of weakness. Mr Deng Xiaoping, China's supreme leader who has
probably exercised more power in post-revolution China than anyone except
Mao himself, has never been premier, president or party boss: he has not
needed titles to assert his authority.
Mr Jiang, who is being referred to in China's official propaganda as the
'core' of the leadership, was not even a member of the Standing Committee of
the Politburo, the normal springboard for even higher office, when he was
hastily moved from Shanghai, where he was mayor, to Beijing in mid-1989,
just weeks after the Tiananmen massacre. Among his qualifications for the
job, apparently, was his lack of direct involvement in the decision to crack
down on the protesters.
His official profile reveals that he was born in August, 1926 in Yanzhou
City, Jiangsu Province in eastern China not far from Shanghai. The son of
intellectuals (his communist father Jiang Shangqing is said to have died at
the hands of the Kuomintang), Mr Jiang graduated as an engineer from
Shanghai's Jiaotong University in 1947, a year after joining the communist
party.
After the 1949 revolution, there followed a series of fairly humdrum jobs,
including boss of a foodstuffs factory. One highlight was his posting to the
Soviet Union in 1955 to work in the Stalin Automobile Factory in Moscow
where he learned a smattering of Russian.
Chinese propaganda makes much of Mr Jiang's linguistic skills (he is also
said to be able to speak English and Romanian) and his musical abilities.
Thus Xinhua, China's news agency, in a recent profile, painted a picture of
a cultured leader 'capable of appreciating literature, arts, music and
painting'.
China's new president is married to his childhood sweetheart, Wang Yeping,
the former head of a Shanghai engineering research institute. The couple
have two sons. There is at least one grandchild.
While seeking to present Mr Jiang as an avuncular figure worthy of the love
and respect of the masses, the Xinhua biography pointedly mentioned, as
might be expected of the putative father of the nation, that he is 'strict
with his children'.
Little is known of what fate might have befallen him during that defining
moment for many of China's leaders, the Cultural Revolution of 1966-1976;
but it seems that he weathered those storms fairly adequately. Mr Jiang, one
suspects, has invariably managed to be politically correct, whatever winds
might have been blowing at the time.

FT  29 MAR 93 / China's leaders send a message to the world

<TEXT>
CHINA'S parliament appointed new state functionaries at the weekend to
smooth the transition from old-guard revolutionaries to a younger, more
technocratic leadership, Tony Walker writes from Beijing.
The appointment of Mr Jiang Zemin, 67, the general secretary of the
Communist party and chairman of the Central Military Commission, to the
additional post of state president is aimed at strengthening collective
leadership in the post-Deng Xiaoping era. Likewise, the reappointment of Mr
Li Peng, 65, to a second five-year term is intended to solidify the
leadership group in this transition phase.
Mr Deng, China's supreme leader, is 88 and has aged noticeably in the past
year or so. He has urged Chinese officials to speed economic reform, and has
been engaged recently in promoting a younger generation of reformists to
preserve his legacy, although doubts persist over the cautious Mr Li's
commitment to change.
The leadership was clearly intent on sending a strong signal to the
international community of its intent to continue opening its economy with
the appointment as vice-president of Mr Rong Yiren, the millionaire head of
China International Trust and Investment Corporation.
Among other significant appointments was that of Mr Qiao Shi, a member of
the Standing Committee of the Politburo, to the post of chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament.
Mr Qiao, 69, who is in charge of security matters, is likely to emerge as a
key figure in the post-Deng era. His security responsibilities have tended
to keep him in the shadows until now.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Kenya denies rift with donors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Kenyan government has dismissed claims of a rift with donors and denied
allegations of malpractice in the country's banking sector.
'The government is continuing the dialogue with the IMF and World Bank and
other donors, but on the basis of more rational and sustainable measures,'
Mr Musalia Mudavadi, the minister of finance, said in a statement at the
weekend.
Donors and bankers had expressed deep concern over the government's decision
last Monday to suspend or reverse key elements of its economic reform
programme. President Daniel arap Moi had earlier accused the IMF and the
Bank of forcing 'dictatorial and suicidal' measures on the government.
Last week's decision was 'intended to save the economy from collapse, it was
not intended to result in a break with the Fund or the Bank,' said the
minister.
The minister denied allegations of fraud in connection with an export
compensation scheme.
He also rejected reports that certain banks said to have political
connections received favoured treatment.
'It is true that a few banks have run overdrafts with the central bank due
to liquidity problems resulting from financial liberalisation, adverse
publicity and other underlying problems,' said the minister.
But he stressed that the banks were not insolvent, and had 'substantial
fixed assets which are in the process of being liquidated to generate
liquidity'. To deny them overdrafts would have caused 'upheavals' in the
financial system and 'untold suffering to innocent depositors', he
explained.
'The running of overdrafts was considered the lesser evil,' he added,
'especially considering that the banks involved were being restructured to
eliminate the need for overdrafts.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Russia takes a tumble from ranks of leading 25 traders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE countries of central and eastern Europe, excluding the former Soviet
Union, expanded trade with the west last year for the first time since
beginning their transition to market economies, Gatt said.
While ground-breaking market access agreements signed with the European
Community in March last year were credited with part of the turn-around,
Gatt noted that western European countries boosted their sales to the east
even more strongly.
Meanwhile, Russia's trade continued to tumble. Exports to the west in 1992
amounted to just Dollars 27.6bn (Pounds 19.4bn) - down 25 per cent from
Dollars 36.8bn in 1991. Imports fell similarly, from Dollars 25.6bn to
Dollars 20.2bn.
This trade disruption pulled Russia out of the world's top 25 traders,
despite its dominant position in the trade of the USSR which ranked in the
top 20 exporters in 1991. 'To put this in perspective, Russia exported less
than Norway, and imported less than Portugal,' Gatt said.
The value of exports from the region as a whole fell 10 per cent to Dollars
85bn (after a 25 per cent fall in 1991). But this was entirely due to a 25
per cent fall in exports from the Commonwealth of Independent States to
Dollars 35bn. In contrast, exports from the central and eastern European
states of Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania and the Czech and Slovak
Republics, when taken alone, rose by 10 per cent to Dollars 48bn. This was a
rebound from a 14 per cent fall between 1990 and 1991 which swept exports
down to Dollars 43.6bn.
Western Europe's trade grew strongly with the region. Purchases from central
and eastern Europe rose by 20 per cent between 1991 and 1992. Exports from
the Czech and Slovak republics leapt 63 per cent from Dollars 6bn to Dollars
9.8bn, while exports from Romania jumped 43 per cent to Dollars 2.8bn.
Main gains came in food products, steel and clothing, all products which are
quota limited by last year's 'Europe agreements'.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Kantor may drop dumping inquiry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative, may withdraw a request by his
Republican predecessor that the US International Trade Commission perform an
in-depth study on the impact of US dumping and subsidy rulings.
Republican members of the House ways and means committee, meanwhile, have
prepared for the possibility that the request will be withdrawn, by pushing
for congressional action which would allow the non-partisan ITC to proceed
with the study. They have asked for a preliminary report by January 1994.
In a letter to Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the ways and means
sub-committee, Congressmen Bill Archer and Phil Crane say the study is
needed to evaluate proposed changes in US trade laws resulting from an end
to the Uruguay Round. Generally, the requests of the minority are honoured
as a congressional courtesy.
The Washington trade community has been stirred up since it became public
that Mrs Carla Hills, former US trade representative, had proposed the
dumping study five days before her departure from office. Only the US trade
representative, the Senate finance committee and the House ways and means
committee can request ITC studies.
The 'fair trade' regime is controversial; many Washington lawyers who defend
foreign companies are convinced its procedures are intrinsically biased
towards American companies and sometimes, politicised. Those who generally
defend domestic companies see the laws as the only legitimate weapon against
predatory imports. Mr Kantor sees the fair trade laws as a necessity.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Single-market EC heads export league
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE completion of Europe's single market in January this year has had a
radical impact on world trade, at least from a statistical point of view.
Not only does the European Community become the world's leading exporter -
far outstripping the US - with exports of Dollars 565bn (Pounds 397.8bn),
but world trade falls from Dollars 3,700bn to Dollars 2,800bn, as sales
between EC member states become domestic trade.
The disappearance of EC exporters such as Germany and France from the
rankings of top traders also brings five Asian countries into the top 10 for
the first time: Hong Kong is fifth, followed by China, Taiwan and Korea.
Singapore is at number 10.

FT  29 MAR 93 / US defence decisions hinge on spending review
</HEADLINE>

THE Clinton administration has postponed all big decisions on military force
structure and defence equipment programmes until it has completed a
'bottom-up review of defence needs and programmes'.
Although the Dollars 263.4bn (Pounds 185bn) defence budget for the 1994
fiscal year, presented at the weekend, cuts two Army divisions, two Navy
aircraft carriers and the equivalent of nearly three Air Force fighter
wings, Mr Les Aspin, US defence secretary, said he had only been able to
make amendments to the budget bequeathed him by the outgoing Bush
administration.
'We are dealing with a 1994 budget, the bulk of which has been written by
the previous administration. We are essentially able to add and subtract
from that defence budget but not really shape it from the ground up,' he
said.
The budget projects defence spending dropping steadily to Dollars 246bn in
1997, before rising again to Dollars 253.9bn in 1998.
The budget resolves none of the outstanding questions over costly and
controversial equipment programmes such as the C-17 transport aircraft, the
V-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft, or the Seawolf submarine.
Procurement costs will be cut by 17 per cent in real terms to Dollars
45.5bn, but this is largely because no new B-2 bombers will be bought, and
only three DD5-51 destroyers, decisions already made under the Bush
administration.
Congressional critics have complained that the Pentagon will not be able to
afford all its major programmes within the framework of President Bill
Clinton's promise to cut deeply into defence spending, but funding is
essentially preserved for all large procurement programmes, pending the
outcome of the review.
Indeed, Mr Aspin has written back into the budget 24 new F-16 fighters that
the Air Force said it did not want, in order to keep the production line
open until decisions have been made on future tactical aircraft for the Navy
and the Air Force.
'This is a cautious budget on the weapons side. We are maintaining a lot of
options,' Mr Aspin said.
One weapons area where decisions have been made is the Strategic Defence
Initiative, often known as Star Wars. While the new budget funds missile
defence development at the same level of Dollars 3.8bn as last year, money
is shifted to short-range tactical defence systems such as the Patriot, and
away from defences against ballistic missiles.
The new administration has, nevertheless, made sharp cuts in personnel and
force structure to meet its targets for spending cuts. Active forces will be
cut by 108,000 to 1.62m, with reserves dropping 60,000 to 1.02m and the
Pentagon's civilian workforce falling by 45,000 to 919,000.
Combined with a government-wide pay freeze, this will cut military personnel
costs by 9 per cent in inflation-adjusted terms to Dollars 70.1bn in 1994.
Mr Aspin claimed that his predecessors, when faced with making budget
savings, tended to make horizontal cuts, keeping the same number of
divisions, carrier battle groups or tactical air wings, but reducing the
number of men in each unit, with the aim of filling them out when war came.
'I am not sure it was the right strategy in those days, in retrospect, but
it is certainly not the right strategy now when the force structure is
really more than we need for the kinds of threats that we are facing now,'
Mr Aspin said.
Pending the outcome of his review, Mr Aspin's interim force structure will
cut the Army from 14 to 12 active divisions. The Navy will fall from 443
ships to 413, dropping to 12 aircraft carriers with the decommissioning of
the Saratoga and the Forrestal. The Air Force will drop from 16.1 active
fighter wing equivalents to 13.3, with one-and-a-half wings eliminated in
Europe and one in the US, as well as an additional wing from the air
reserves.
At the same time, Mr Aspin promised to preserve budgets for training and
operations to ensure that US forces remained at a high degree of readiness.
One new initiative is a specific Dollars 300m allocation for peacekeeping
exercises, which the US has previously paid for out of its regular
operations accounts.
Mr Aspin acknowledged, however, that the allocation was likely to be too
small, noting that the US deployment in Somalia was expected to cost Dollars
700m.

FT  29 MAR 93 / US lectures on economic co-operation ring hollow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US President Bill Clinton, nearly two thirds of the way through the first
hundred days of his administration, has good reason to feel pleased. The
budget package is making good progress through Congress, relations with the
Federal Reserve appear cordial, long-term interest rates have fallen and the
US economy is conveniently accelerating. In short, the domestic economic
agenda looks under control.
His only disappointment is the tardy pace at which the rest of the world is
falling into line. Russian president Boris Yeltsin can hardly be blamed for
his current plight, and the US, like the rest of the world, has little
option but to mouth support and wait with crossed fingers. But other
countries that do control their domestic policy agendas, notably Germany and
Japan, appear less willing to follow the world leader's example.
Undeterred, the Clinton administration has quickly adopted the standard US
presidential practice of lecturing other countries on how to manage their
affairs, with the US Treasury taking the lead on the lecture circuit.
Germany, the G7 finance ministers were told, should cut its interest rates
more rapidly in order to kick-start European demand (for US exports). Japan,
senior Treasury officials publicly imply, should be using fiscal policy in a
more aggressively expansionary way to stimulate Japanese demand (for US
exports). Would-be recipients of aid and debt relief should liberalise their
economies and open their markets (to US exports).
Yet, while it is easy to see why the world's only superpower speaks its
mind, it is less obvious that it has the moral right to do so. While
lecturing other countries about their responsibilities, the world's richest
nation continues to benefit from a huge net resource flow from the developed
and developing world alike. At its peak in 1987, the net resource transfer
to the US was Dollars 151.4bn (Pounds 106.6bn), of which over Dollars 70bn
came from developing countries, equivalent to 2 per cent of developing
country GDP. The cumulative flow since 1980 is a little over Dollars 980bn.
The US might bridle at these statistics. The net resource flow (equivalent
to the US current account deficit minus net interest, profits and dividends)
is, after all, the product of millions of individual, private and voluntary
decisions. Yet the US, by virtue of its size and economic power, can alter
the incentives that private individuals face. Hence, the rise of the US
fiscal deficit in the 1980s was, in part, responsible for the rise in world
interest rates and the flood of capital into the US.
This sharp rise in real interest rates encouraged US commercial banks to
liquidate their third world lending to take advantage of the higher domestic
returns, thus bringing on the debt crisis. Not that the US can take all the
blame. While profligate US fiscal policy sucked resources in, mistaken
domestic policies in many developing countries also drove resources towards
the US. This was particularly true of Latin America and Africa for whom the
stock of flight capital is estimated at a third to two thirds of annual GDP.
For all its good intentions, the Clinton administration will continue to
suck scarce resources towards the world's richest country. Its budget plans
envisage a budget deficit of over 3 per cent of GDP by 1998 while the
combination of a nascent recovery and persistently low US national savings
will expand the current account deficit over the next year.
It is the regional profile of America's capital donors, not the demand
placed on them, that appears to be altering. Budget deficit-burdened Europe
is now importing capital from the US, while eastern Europe is drawing on US
savings. Meanwhile, economic reform and debt relief in Latin America has
made the region a magnet for portfolio investment, capturing almost all of
the 135 per cent (Dollars 4.7bn) increase in annual equity flows to
developing counties over the past three years. This leaves an extraordinary
alliance of Japan, east Asia and debt-burdened Africa to finance the world's
largest, and least progressive, economic assistance programme.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Growth in world trade speeds up after 3 years: A look at
Gatt's annual world trade report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD trade growth accelerated in 1992 after three years of slowdown,
according to figures published today by the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade. The main stimulus came from North America and Asia.
Gatt forecasts in its annual world trade report that trade growth in 1993
will 'at least equal' 1992, but warns that 'much of the risk is on the
downside'. Noting that trade grew more slowly during the second half of 1992
as western Europe and Japan fell into recession, it said the acceleration
needed to better 1992 'may be difficult to achieve'.
The value of world trade grew by 5.5 per cent to Dollars 3,700bn (Pounds
2,605bn), compared with growth of 1.5 per cent in 1991. The volume rose by
4.5 per cent, reversing a period of steady slowing since 1988, when growth
fell from more than 8 per cent to 3.5 per cent in 1991.
The US maintained its position as the world's leading exporter, lifting
sales by 6 per cent to Dollars 447bn. Behind it, Germany boosted exports by
6.5 per cent to Dollars 425bn. Strongest gains came from China and Hong
Kong, where exports rose by 18.2 per cent and 20 per cent respectively.
Taken together, they would overtake the UK to be the fifth biggest exporter.
The US remained by far the leading importer, with a rise of 8.6 per cent to
Dollars 552bn; Germany was a distant second with Dollars 408bn. A 1.8 per
cent fall by Japan to Dollars 233bn resulted in France overtaking it as the
third largest importer. It bought merchandise worth Dollars 240bn, up 3.4
per cent from Dollars 232bn in 1991.
The greatest jump in imports came in Latin America, up 18.5 per cent to
Dollars 170bn. Mexico became the 17th biggest importer, with a rise of 23.5
per cent from Dollars 66bn to Dollars 82bn. Argentina, Chile and Venezuela
also saw strong surges.
At a time when 'trade has been a source of relative strength in an otherwise
mostly weak economic environment', Gatt calls for markets to be kept open,
and for fresh efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round of talks on trade
liberalisation.
The report shows trade in services growing from Dollars 890bn to Dollars
960bn last year, a rise of 8 per cent.
At the same time, the economies of central and eastern Europe began to show
the first signs of export recovery since their painful transitions to market
economies. While exports slipped by 10 per cent to Dollars 85bn - an
improvement from a 25 per cent slump in 1991 - sales to western Europe
jumped by 20 per cent.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Top trading nations suffer current account imbalances
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CURRENT account imbalances of four of the world's five leading trading
powers widened in 1992, Gatt said.
When trade in both goods and services is taken into account, France was
alone among the top five traders in moving into virtual balance on its
current account.
Japan's current account surplus widened from Dollars 73bn to a record
Dollars 118bn (Pounds 79.1bn) as recession cut imports.
In contrast, the US current account deficit leaped from a negligible Dollars
4bn in 1991 to Dollars 62bn as economic recovery sucked in imports.
Germany's current account deficit rose from Dollars 20bn to Dollars 25bn in
spite of slowing import growth, as recession began to bite in the second
half of 1992. This was because of a higher deficit in trade in commercial
services, and a falling surplus on investment income.
In the UK, beginnings of economic recovery saw a strong import surge
boosting the current account deficit from Dollars 11.4bn in 1991 to Dollars
21bn last year.
Criticising the 'popular press', and implicitly the US administration, for
focusing political attention on widening merchandise trade gaps, Gatt said
'this is clearly inappropriate because trade in services is an important and
growing part of countries' trade.'
Despite the numerical widening of imbalances, Gatt noted that growth in
these economies through the 1980s had meant that the current account
deficits were smaller relative to GDP 'than in most other years since the
early 1980s'.
Even in Japan, the surplus was lower last year in relation to the size of
its economy than between 1985 and 1987.
Germany and the UK show the most worrisome trends, the UK slipping from a
position in 1982 where it had the highest current account surplus of all
five traders in terms of GDP to a position last year where it had the
highest deficit, at 2 per cent of GDP.

FT  29 MAR 93 / International Company News: Inchcape motoring to strong
performance - A look at the progress of the group since the acquisition of
TKM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCHCAPE, the international motor and business services group, is today
expected to report sharply increased profits and earnings, thereby
maintaining its strong performance in spite of recession.
Reporting good results will also be a significant landmark for Mr Charles
Mackay, who took over at the end of 1991 from Sir George Turnbull, the
group's forceful chairman and chief executive.
Mr Mackay had already been chosen to work as chief executive alongside Sir
George, but the chairman's sudden illness meant the succession had to be
brought forward at very short notice. Sir George, who died in December,
helped transform the former colonial trading house into a premium-rated
FTSE-100 stock, which currently has a market value of more than Pounds 3bn.
When Sir George became ill, Mr Mackay, who had led the Far Eastern
operation, was in London negotiating the Pounds 382m acquisition of Tozer
Kemsley Millbourn, the motors and retailing concern. The purchase, from
Brierley Investments of New Zealand, was funded by a 1-for-3 rights issue,
Inchcape's first since it was floated in 1958.
Mr Mackay said there was no time for any handover: 'We were right in the
middle of the TKM deal, so one could hardly have asked for a more
inauspicious start. It worked very well because the TKM deal galvanised the
whole company, pulling everyone together - it was very exciting. The rights
was well received in the City and it gave all of us a sense of pride.
'The more fundamental thing was George's legacy - it didn't all collapse
when George himself suddenly disappeared. Inchcape under George was
remarkably free of company politics. That team spirit he fostered just rode
on; the momentum was unstoppable. People also closed ranks and did it as a
sort of tribute for George.'
Sir David Orr, who was chairman of the group between 1983-86, stepped in to
fill that role again until September, when Sir David Plastow arrived. Sir
David, 60, is another motors veteran, having just retired as chairman from
Vickers, the engineering group that includes Rolls-Royce Motors.
The group has appointed three executive directors to the board and two
non-executives in the last year. Mr Mackay said: 'The people who had been
brought in by George in their mid-forties woke up one day and found they
were in their fifties. It crept up on us and it was felt necessary that we
get the right age profile for our board.'
Mr Mackay talks enthusiastically about the TKM acquisition as a 'quantum
leap' for Inchcape. 'It broadened the range of people we were involved with
and heightened our already very strong image with motor manufacturers. We've
taken on eight motor franchises in the last year - more than we did in the
past 10.'
A joint venture with Peugeot, to import the French maker's cars into Japan,
had caused a lot of excitement. 'We have had approaches from other
manufacturers, to see what we could do for them - to which our response is
'hang on guys, we've just started this one - let's not run before we've
learned to walk.'
In spite of Inchcape's recent success, some observers expressed unease that
the TKM deal increased the exposure to motors, lifting the proportion of
sales and profits from 50 to 60 per cent.
Mr Mackay said: 'One reason people are concerned is that there is a general
perception that motors is a cyclical business. If you look at Inchcape and
our track record, you will find that is not actually the case. We're not a
Ford, and we're not a Tom Cowie (the UK motor distributor). We're a
relatively unique, as an import/distribution specialist.
'When a downturn comes, our spread of business across 26 countries means
that we've managed to keep going through all recessions. The UK may be going
through a tough time, but Hong Kong has just had a boom year - and so has
Greece. There's not another motors group of which that is true.
'The big mistake people make is in assuming that size of market determines
profitability - whereas almost the reverse is true.'
The chief executive also expressed satisfaction with the progress of 'global
streaming,' that is dividing the group's activities by business - motors,
marketing and services such as shipping and insurance - rather than by
location.
Mr Mackay said this process had undoubtedly started to produce benefits,
although more remained to be done. 'One thing we have not yet got to grips
with is the transfer of best practice. It's amazing how much resistance
there is - just sheer inertia.'
In spite of the success of the TKM deal, Mr Mackay sounds a cautionary note:
'Acquisitions hit the headlines - and there's a danger there, both
internally and externally, that everyone starts thinking that is what it's
all about.
'To put it in perspective: if you go back to 1982, our motors business made
operating profits of about Pounds 10-12m. By 1991 (pre-TKM acquisition) we'd
got it up to about Pounds 120m. Nearly all of that came from organic growth,
doing better, selling more cars, getting more efficient.'
He believes 75 per cent of growth in the motors business should come from
organic growth - defined as including bolt-on acquisitions, and only about
25 per cent from larger acquisitions. 'We have made it absolutely clear that
does not mean we have to get that quarter - if we find the right
acquisitions, we will - if we don't, we won't'

FT  29 MAR 93 / UK Company News: EFM Dragon success in battle for Drayton
Asia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EFM DRAGON Trust has won control of Drayton Asia Trust, removing yet another
investment vehicle from the the stable managed by Invesco MIM.
Edinburgh Fund Managers said it had received acceptances for its bids from
51.26 per cent of Drayton Asia's capital and 42.04 per cent of its warrants.
Mr Ratan Engineer, chairman of Drayton Asia, which strongly contested the
bid, admitted that EFM Dragon was 'home and dry', but continued to claim
that the deal was unsatisfactory for its shareholders, as there was no offer
of a cash alternative.
Last week Drayton dropped alternative proposals, which would have offered
shareholders the choice between a unit trust and a new split capital
investment trust, blaming opposition from CIN, the manager of the British
Coal Pension Funds.
CIN has a 20.1 per cent stake in Drayton Asia, and a controlling interest in
Edinburgh Fund Managers, which manages EFM Dragon.
EFM Dragon must now calculate Drayton Asia's formula asset value as at March
26 before Drayton shareholders can be issued with Dragon shares under the
terms of the bid. This will be done 'as soon as possible'.
The offer has been extended.
Sir Hugh Byatt, chairman of EFM Dragon, said: 'The way is now clear for
shareholders and warrant holders to accept the offers in order to merge
Drayton Asia with Dragon and create the largest pure Asian investment trust
in the UK.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / UK Company News: C&amp;J Clark debate heats up
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MEMBERS of the 500-strong Clark family will meet early this week to consider
alternatives to a sale of C&amp;J Clark, the private shoe manufacturer which is
the focus of an offer from foods and property company, Berisford.
The debate will be fuelled by the publication of the company's annual
results and an accompanying letter calling an extraordinary general meeting
to consider Berisford's offer. The results are likely to be announced within
the next week.
Meanwhile, it is believed that one of the four dissident directors has been
rebuffed in attempts to get other bids considered. The majority of the board
backs the bid from Berisford, which was invited by Clark's advisers,
Schroders, to participate in the tender process.

FT  29 MAR 93 / UK Company News: Buckingham holders told to sell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDEPENDENT directors of Buckingham International will today advise
investors in the struggling hotels and nursing homes group to sell their
shares, as its cash difficulties appear greater than previously thought.
Their statement marks a change of opinion on a Pounds 12.4m offer for
Buckingham's common and loan stock from Purlieus, a Jersey company
controlled by Jemma Trust and Naaz Holdings. Together they own 38.7 per cent
of Buckingham and the Takeover Panel ordered them to bid for the rest.
The directors will tell shareholders they should either accept the offer or
sell their ordinary shares in the market for a higher price. They should
retain, though, their loan stock. Purlieus is offering 2.75p per ordinary
share and 27.5p per Pounds 1 nominal of loan stock.
Earlier this month the directors advised shareholders to reject the bid and
retain an ongoing interest. The shares closed down  1/4 p on Friday at 5p.
The group's survival, however, is now in doubt if it cannot find funding -
either through project finance or asset sales - before the middle of 1993.
Pounds 100m.

FT  29 MAR 93 / News Corp seeks Dollars 3bn and The Post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch's News Corporation is seeking a Dollars 3bn (Pounds
2.10bn) revolving loan from a group of 30 to 40 international banks to help
refinance outstanding debts at lower interest rates.
Although terms of the deal, believed to have a maturity of more than five
years, were not available, it is understood that Citibank of the US and
Midland of the UK are among the lead banks involved.
The Dollars 3bn refinancing is the latest step in the restructuring of News
Corp's debt. In late 1990, News Corp was facing severe financial problems
with debts of more than Dollars 7.6bn. News Corp was forced into lengthy
negotiations with nearly 150 lending banks and after months of talks, it was
agreed that about Dollars 7.6bn of debt would be restructured over three
years.
Separately, Mr Murdoch announced last night that he had signed an agreement
with Mr Abe Hirschfeld, a New York car parks magnate, to transfer control of
The New York Post, the bankrupt tabloid newspaper, to News Corp.
The accord will depend upon the outcome of a joint application to be made
this morning by the two before a New York bankruptcy judge. The deal was
signed yesterday by Mr Murdoch, who lost an estimated Dollars 150m when he
last owned the newspaper in 1988, following a meeting on Friday evening with
Mr Hirschfeld, who has controlled The Post since March 12.
The offer will involve Mr Murdoch providing operating capital and taking
control of the paper for the next 60 days, pending the approval from the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of a request to waive rules that
normally prevent cross-ownership of both a newspaper and a television
station in one city.
If today's hearing goes well Mr Murdoch could obtain operating control of
the newspaper from as early as tonight. . He already has the support of Mr
Mario Cuomo, the New York governor, as well as the paper's editorial staff,
creditors and managers - many of whom have been horrified at the behaviour
of Mr Hirschfeld.
Mr Murdoch's costs over the next 60 days may reach Dollars 8m and he would
then have to provide a plan to bring The Post out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection.
'Although we are hopeful that we can successfully conclude these
arrangements there remain very serious obstacles,' Mr Murdoch said last
night.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Co-operating to survive in a global market: Paul Betts
explains why a group of smaller airlines is talking about partnership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Jan Carlzon, the chief executive of Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS),
describes the current flurry of mergers and partnerships in the airline
business as the ketchup bottle effect: 'You shake and shake the bottle and
nothing seems to happen until it all comes pouring out at once.'
For the past eight years, the SAS boss has been one of the most consistent
and ardent proponents of transnational co-operation to enable smaller and
medium-sized airlines like SAS to compete against the larger European,
American and Asian carriers in an increasingly deregulated and global
industry.
He is now in the throes of complex partnership discussions with three other
medium-sized European carriers - Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Austrian Airlines - to try to establish a 'fourth force' in the European
airline market to compete against the big three - British Airways, Air
France and Lufthansa of Germany.
If successful, the current talks could ultimately lead to a merger of the
four carriers which combined would be larger than BA, Air France or
Lufthansa. It would have a fleet of around 270 aircraft, employ more than
80,000 people, and carry around 30m passengers a year.
The four carriers have already established 16 working parties to study how
they could work more closely together by creating a multi-hub traffic system
based around Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Geneva and Vienna; integrating their
fleets and future aircraft purchasing policies; combining frequent flier
programmes; rationalising their structures and cutting costs by setting up,
for example, one head office instead of four.
One working paper leaked last week goes as far as proposing a full merger
with a joint company controlling four separate operating arms with aircraft
flying under the same logo and common colours.
The four airlines insist that nothing has yet been decided and that a wide
range of proposals are still under consideration. The conclusions of the
different studies are to be submitted to the heads of the four airlines next
month. By the end of June, they are expected to take a decision.
'What is clear is that the four airlines want to move quickly', said one
party to the talks.
The convoluted ownership structure of the airlines, especially SAS in which
the Swedish, Danish and Norwegian governments all own stakes, is likely to
complicate merger plans. The unions and some vocal sections of government
are also expected to resist radical merger proposals to protect employment
and defend national pride.
But there are compelling reasons for the four airlines to gang together. All
four share common problems as well as similar strategies. Their domestic
markets are too small to support a strong international airline. For this
reason, they have all long branched out to forge links with carriers around
the globe to operate viable traffic networks.
SAS has developed links with Continental in the US, Lan Chile in South
America, Thai in south east Asia, ANA in Japan. In the UK it owns 25 per
cent of Airlines of Britain which operates the regional carrier British
Midland. Swissair has cross-equity partnerships with Singapore Airlines and
Delta in the US. KLM holds a stake in Northwest Airlines of the US, has a
long standing relationship with Garuda of Indonesia and a stake in the
British regional carrier Air UK. Swissair and ANA both have minority stakes
in Austrian, the smallest and weakest of the four.
As an initial response to growing competition in Europe and the emergence of
so-called 'mega carriers' in the US and Asia, SAS, Swissair and Austrian
formed four years ago what they termed the European Quality Alliance.
Originally, the three airlines envisaged swapping stakes, but this proved
too difficult because of the complex SAS ownership structure. However, the
partnership has slowly started to bear fruits.
The three carriers co-ordinated last year the launch of new services to
eastern Europe. Swissair and Austrian have combined marketing forces in
their domestic markets. SAS has been marketing its African and South
American traffic through Swissair. Some co-ordination in the use of
equipment has already taken place.
Early on, SAS also sought to attract KLM to the table. But the talks were
interrupted two years ago when the Dutch carrier decided to enter into
merger negotiations with BA. The dialogue was renewed after the BA-KLM talks
collapsed largely on the issue of control.
It has since gathered pace with the advent this year of the new single
European aviation market and the industry's financial troubles due to
recession. These combined pressures have, in turn, intensified the trend
towards greater consolidation.
In Britain, BA bought stakes in USAir, Qantas in Australia and in two small
regional carriers in Europe. Meanwhile, Air France has taken control of Air
Inter, the French domestic carrier, and UTA, the independent French
long-haul airline, as well as buying stakes in Sabena of Belgium and CSA of
Czechoslovakia. Lufthansa is also scouting for partnership opportunities
while it aggressively restructures itself.
Time is running out for Europe's medium-sized carriers.
However, a merger could take some time. After all, it took five years to
find the proper corporate structure for SAS before the airline was created
from the separate Swedish, Norwegian and Danish international airline
operations in 1951.
But as one executive close to the current talks said: 'That does not mean we
cannot agree quickly to have the benefits of a merger without actually
having a merger.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Glaxo to withdraw claims for Zantac
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAXO Holdings, Europe's largest pharmaceutials company, has agreed to
demands by the US Food and Drug Administration that it withdraws some
promotional claims about its ulcer treatment drug Zantac.
In January this year, the FDA said Glaxo 'frequently suggests unapproved
uses for Zantac and consistently makes comparative efficacy and safety
claims that are not supported by adequate data'.
Glaxo stopped publishing the contested claims in advertising and promotional
literature earlier this month, but objected to the FDA's claims and said it
was unlikely to write to US doctors as the FDA had demanded.
The company said it has agreed with the FDA on a letter to be sent to US
doctors, correcting its standard literature. Discussions continue on how
Glaxo's retractions should be published.
Zantac is the world's best-selling medicine with annual sales of about
Pounds 2bn, representing 45 per cent of Glaxo's turnover. Annual US sales
are estimated by analysts at Dollars 1.4bn (Pounds 980m).
The company stressed yesterday its right to distribute the drug in the US
had never been questioned.
An analyst said: 'This makes it harder for Glaxo to differentiate Zantac
from Tagamet. When there is a cheaper generic version of Tagamet on the
market in the US next year it may be harder for Zantac to maintain market
share.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Rivals emphasise doubts at IBM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUSIE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM's competitors moved swiftly over the weekend to capitalise on
uncertainty created inside and outside the world's largest computer maker by
the appointment as chief executive of Mr Louis Gerstner, a man with no
computer industry experience.
Choosing Mr Gerstner, who joins IBM on Thursday from RJR Nabisco, the food
and tobacco group, was a bold but risky way for IBM's board to try to
revitalise the company, many computer executives and analysts said.
Questions about IBM's technology and product strategies will pile up while
Mr Gerstner gets to grips with the company, they added.
'The customer is saying, holy mackerel, why should I buy any more from IBM
until this guy figures out what he is doing?' said Mr Scott McNealy, chief
executive of Sun Microsystems, the leading computer workstation
manufacturer.
Computer buyers realise that Mr Gerstner is likely to eliminate some
products as he streamlines IBM, but they don't know which ones, he explains.
The fear of buying IBM products that will soon be obsolete 'gives Sun's
sales people a really nice run at the IBM customer base'.
If IBM's customers are worried, its employees are living in fear and dread
of the 'axe man', a reputation Mr Gerstner brings with him from RJR Nabisco,
where he lopped the workforce and sold off assets.
Wall Street analysts expect Mr Gerstner to accelerate the 'downsizing' of
IBM by cutting up to 100,000 people from the company's 300,000 payroll.
Among computer experts, another source of concern is Mr Gerstner's lack of
prior experience in the computer industry.
Others see Mr Gerstner's lack of computer industry experience as a positive
advantage because he will be forced to rely upon the advice of others,
pushing responsibility down the ranks.
But that raises questions about who Mr Gerstner will choose as his top
advisers.
'The management team he builds is much more important than what he knows
about mips and flops,' said Mr Regis McKenna, an industry consultant.
'Making IBM faster on its feet is going to be the key challenge.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Economics Notebook: Back on track with a policy to fight
inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It has taken six months. But Britain now has a comprehensive monetary policy
to replace sterling's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism.
The final touches were provided by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, in his
Budget. The logic behind the policy was fleshed out by Mr Mervyn King, the
Bank of England's chief economist, at a seminar in London last week.
The chancellor devoted only six paragraphs of his 1 hour 51 minute Budget
speech to monetary policy. The two innovations contained in the paragraphs
disappointed monetarists and appeared to mark a dilution of the government's
previous stance.
M0, the narrow measure of money supply, which had been targeted by the
government since 1984, is now subject to a 'monitoring range'. If growth of
M0, which consists mainly of notes and coins in circulation, strays outside
the 0 to 4 per cent range during the period of the government's medium-term
financial strategy to 1997-98, it will be 'likely to be a cause for
concern'.
The existing monitoring range for annual growth of M4, the broad measure of
money supply which also embraces bank and building society deposits, was
modifed to 3 to 9 per cent from the 4 to 8 per cent set last November for
the period to the end of March. The M4 monitoring range will also apply for
the full life of the MTFS and movements of broad money outside its bands
should sound a warning to the government.
The purpose of monetary policy is to achieve low inflation. Shortly after
leaving the ERM, the government announced an explicit inflation target of
keeping underlying inflation, measured by the retail prices index minus
mortgage interest payments, in a 1 to 4 per cent range over the life of this
parliament.
This inflation target is now at the centre of the government's
anti-inflation strategy. According to the Treasury 'Red Book' published on
Budget day, the interest-rate decisions needed to keep inflation in the
target range will be based on a continuing assessment of monetary
conditions, measured mainly by the growth of M0 and M4, as well as movement
of the exchange rate and asset prices. While there are no targets or
monitoring ranges for sterling or asset values, sharp movements in these
indicators would also trigger official concern.
These four indicators are therefore the main determinants of interest rates
in the UK. Although the framework for policy decisions falls short of the
simple triggers beloved by financial markets, UK monetary policy should be
more predictable than previously. Interest-rate decisions will still be
based on judgment but not driven wholly by the seat of the pants.
But what are we to make of the Budget innovations of the new monitoring
range for M0 and the broader monitoring range for M4?
M0's annual growth rate has been higher than 4 per cent since February,
while M4 growth, at just over 3 per cent in recent months, has been below
the lower limit of the old monitoring range. A cynic might suppose that the
ranges were modified in the Budget to accommodate these two wayward
indicators.
The Treasury's feeble explanation that it had widened its monitoring range
to 6 from 4 percentage points 'because it now applies to a longer period'
might excite such suspicions in the case of M4.
But there is a sound intellectual reason for abandoning the M0 target. So
long as underlying inflation is targeted, it is illogical and impractical to
have an intermediate target as well.
Moreover, the Treasury believes that M0 may be subject to special factors
that might justify a more relaxed attitude to its recent rapid growth. The
Treasury's monthly monetary report in February said that low interest rates
could be encouraging higher cash holdings, so fuelling the growth of M0.
A more esoteric explanation was provided in the Red Book. It says the growth
of velocity of circulation of M0 has slowed in recent years and was close to
zero in 1992-93. If this trend persists, M0 could grow at a higher rate than
the 4 per cent upper limit of its monitoring range without indicating any
resurgence of inflationary pressures in the economy.
So much for the policy framework. But the best designed monetary policy is
of little use if it lacks credibility.
It is here that the UK authorities have a problem. In February, the Bank of
England noted that expectations of inflation had not yet adjusted to levels
compatible with the 1 to 4 per cent target range for inflation.
The message was hammered home last week by Mr King. He pointed out that
long-term interest rates in Britain, at 7.8 per cent, were higher than
Germany's 6.6 per cent and France's 7.4 per cent. Although British inflation
is currently below German levels, the difference in long-term rates suggests
that monetary policy in Germany enjoys more credibility than in the UK.
The new monetary policy has some institutional trappings for boosting
credibility in which the Bank sets much store. One is its quarterly
inflation report, which according to Mr King, will be a 'visible
demonstration' of the Bank's 'resolve to signal when remedial policy action'
such as higher interest rates is required.
Another is the specific mandate given to Mr Eddie George when he was
appointed the next governor of the Bank. Mr George, who takes over on July
1, has been told that 'his central responsibility should be to support the
government in its determination to bring about a lasting reduction in the
rate of inflation'.
But ultimately, it will be the actions of the UK authorities and their
ability to keep inflation within the prescribed target band that will
determine whether the new monetary policy gains the credibility it currently
lacks.
This will take time. At the very least, Mr Lamont will have to avoid
changing interest rates for purely political reasons, as was the case last
October when interest rates fell in response to the pit closure crisis, or
in conditions of muddle, as happened on January 26 when base rates were
reduced to their present 6 per cent level.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Naples political chiefs face probe: Former Italian PM
Andreotti investigated for alleged Mafia links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE political bosses in Naples were warned yesterday that they were under
investigation for alleged association with the city's organised crime
families, the Camorra.
This follows the move by Palermo magistrates over the weekend advising Mr
Giulio Andreotti, the veteran Christian Democrat politician who has served
seven times as prime minister, that he is under investigation for allegedly
consorting with the Sicilian Mafia.
These latest moves confirmed that the shadowy links between the Mafia and
political establishment have become a central issue in Italy's corruption
scandals.
Mr Andreotti, 74, and now a life senator, is the most senior political
figure to have received such a warning. In a cool manner, he released the
news and proceeded to defend himself vigorously.
Parliament has been sent a dossier concerning Mr Andreotti running to more
than 200 pages, and this will form the basis of whether his parliamentary
immunity will be waived.
As Italy's postwar political establishment has been incapacitated by over a
year's investigations into corruption in the north of the country, the
politicians' long-suspected links with organised crime in the south have
scarcely been touched.
Naples magistrates have begun to act after years of inactivity or
investigations which were deliberately buried. Within the past 48 hours, 18
members of parliament and Euro-MPs have been warned they are under
investigation for alleged corruption and half the city council has been
arrested. All the Naples political bosses have been caught in the net and
the magistrates are now following even more potentially explosive leads of
their alleged links with the local Mafia.
Those served notice yesterday are already involved in investigations for
corruption. The most notable are two former Christian Democrat ministers -
Mr Antonio Gava and Mr Paolo Cirino Pomicino. Last night Mr Gava, a former
interior minister, resigned as leader of the Christian Democrat group in the
senate and his seat on the joint parliamentary commission for constitutional
reform. He and Mr Pomicino, a former finance minister, denied Mafia
involvement.
According to Palermo magistrates, they wish to question Mr Andreotti over
his connections with Mr Salvatore Lima, the Christian Democrat Euro-MP
assassinated by the Mafia last March. Mr Lima, the most powerful politician
in Sicily, was a close friend of Mr Andreotti and considered to have acted
as an intermediary with Rome.
Investigations into Mr Lima's death and the subsequent assassination of the
two leading anti-Mafia magistrates, Mr Giovanni Falcone and Mr Paolo
Borsellino, lie behind the magistrates' move against Mr Andreotti.
His alleged mediation with the Mafia has been referred to by at least three
and perhaps six former members of Sicilian clans which are co-operating
under special plea bargaining programmes. Mr Andreotti claimed these
confessions were part of a vendetta for having initiated a drive against
organised crime.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Trade talks seek to avert US sanctions and lift Gatt round
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR US and European Community trade officials hold critical talks in
Brussels today aimed at averting US sanctions over EC government purchasing
policies, and at restoring momentum to stalled negotiations on global trade
liberalisation.
The most urgent task facing Sir Leon Brittan, EC trade commissioner, and the
US trade representative Mr Mickey Kantor will be to find a compromise in a
dispute over government contracts.
At the centre of the disagreement is an EC rule that Washington believes
gives unfair preference to Community companies in winning public contracts.
A US threat of sanctions affecting about Dollars 45m to Dollars 50m of EC
goods was put on hold following talks in Washington last week between
President Bill Clinton and Mr Jacques Delors, EC president.
US officials have warned that sanctions will go ahead later this week if Sir
Leon and Mr Kantor fail to reach a compromise. The row could rapidly
escalate, as the EC says it is ready to retaliate.
The talks coincide with figures published today by the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade showing that world trade grew by 5.5 per cent to Dollars
3,700bn (Pounds 2,600bn) last year, reversing four years of slowing growth.
Gatt officials are urging fresh efforts to conclude the Uruguay Round of
talks on world trade liberalisation, saying: 'Trade has been a source of
relative strength in an otherwise mostly weak economic environment.'
Both the EC and the US say they are keen to use the meeting between Sir Leon
and Mr Kantor to revive the Uruguay Round. Today's talks are expected to be
confined to charting a route towards a market access package under which the
EC would lower tariffs on electronics products, non-ferrous metals and paper
and wood products.
Mr Kantor, meanwhile, signalled to EC negotiators in an interview with the
FT that, while trade politics fascinate him, trade theology does not.
'I'm not going to be caught in a theological debate that does not lead to
practical and pragmatic results,' he said.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Bosnian aid arrives as truce takes hold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BELGRADE, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A CEASEFIRE from noon yesterday agreed by Bosnia's three warring parties
appeared to be holding last night, as a long-delayed United Nations relief
convoy reached a besieged town in eastern Bosnia.
On Saturday the convoy, destined for Srebrenica where 60,000 people are
desperate for food and medical aid, was stopped from crossing into Bosnia by
local Serbs. This was in spite of an undertaking by General Ratko Mladic,
the Bosnian Serb army commander.
Hopes rose yesterday that it would at last get through when it was given
clearance by the Bosnian Serbs at the border town of Mali Zvornik, and its
arrival at Srebrenica was reported by the UN last night.
The uncertain situation on the ground was matched by the equally fragile
state of the peace negotiations in New York, following the signature last
week of important elements of the internationally brokered peace plan by Mr
Alija Izetbegovic, the Bosnian president.
Mr Izetbegovic said at the weekend that the Bosnian Serbs - the only ones
not to have signed the plan put forward by the international mediators, Mr
Cyrus Vance and Lord Owen - had between 10 and 15 days to endorse it. If
they did not accept it by that deadline, he would consider his own signature
invalid.
However, Lord Owen said in a US television interview yesterday that a 10 to
15-day deadline was 'too early' to secure the Bosnian Serbs' signature. Mr
Izetbegovic had not mentioned such an ultimatum to him when he signed the
agreement in New York last week.
It is nevertheless possible that the Bosnian Serbs will give their verdict
within a short time. Mr Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, said the
parliament of his self-styled republic would vote on the Vance-Owen plan
within the next 10 days.
Meanwhile, France has become the first country to join the US operation to
parachute relief supplies to besieged towns in eastern Bosnia, which land
convoys have been unable to reach. A French C-160 cargo aircraft accompanied
four US cargo aircraft on Saturday night to drop 30 tonnes of food and 600
kg of medical supplies to the mainly Moslem inhabitants of Gorazde.
But Germany, which had intended to join the US relief flights several days
ago, has remained on the sidelines, following a threat by the Bosnian Serbs
to shoot down aircraft of any flights in which Germans participated.
The Bosnian Serbs are still bitter about Germany's occupation of Yugoslavia
during the second world war, and also blame Bonn for what they consider the
European Community's premature recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, thus
precipitating the break-up of Yugoslavia.

FT  29 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: Index-linked gilts
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In theory, index-linked gilts should have been a beneficiary of the Budget.
The lower tax credit on dividends which has reduced the yield on equities
does not affect gilts. The yield on index-linked gilts, which are perhaps
best viewed as a surrogate equity rather than a bond, has thus become more
attractive relative to shares. Over time this could lead institutions to
devote more of their cash-flow to the index-linked market. But there is
unlikely to be a rush.
One problem is that running yields on index-linked gilts are still too low
to attract yield-conscious investors in equities. Another is that even those
who believe that devaluation and the government's economic problems will
eventually rekindle inflation also have to worry about real yields in the
short run. On this matter index-linked gilts take their lead from the
conventional market. And this market is again worried about supply.
Then there is the structural problem of liquidity. Extra sales have
increased the size of the index-linked market by more than Pounds 5bn in the
current financial year. That amounts to an expansion of some 40 per cent,
but there is still no real trading liquidity. So buyers of index-linked may
face punitive dealing costs if they want to sell. The worry is that the
market may never become liquid whatever its size. The high cost of carry
makes index-linked unattractive to market makers.

FT  29 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: ECGD
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The increased export credit cover and lower premiums promised in the Budget
brought qualified approval from industry. Although the Export Credits
Guarantee Department's average premiums have been cut, affordable cover will
not necessarily be available for markets of particular interest to exporters
such as China. But it does look as if the regime has become more relaxed.
The broader fear is that this may ultimately lead to a rerun of the large
losses that plagued ECGD in the 1980s and from which it is only just
recovering.
ECGD's obligation to provide medium-term project cover forces it to take on
large single risks for which no reinsurance cover exists. Like other
national export credit agencies it suffers from a concentration of risks. By
contrast, commercial companies automatically reinsure.
There is an opportunity here for the EC. It could establish a European
export credit reinsurance market which would help put national agencies on a
sounder footing. The stock objection - that one country's taxpayers would
simply end up covering losses incurred by another's exporters - is
short-sighted. Assuming a degree of critical mass, such a market would set a
benchmark for premiums which would make it hard for national agencies to
undercut each other. The unfair competition which British exporters claim to
have faced from low-premium countries like France would disappear. Decisions
to extend cover might become more disciplined.
Unfortunately the chances of such a radical approach look slim. The UK
government's reluctance to extend its own top-up reinsurance facility for
the privatised part of ECGD suggests it has little appreciation of the
reinsurance issue. As long as that remains true, exporters should expect the
export credit tap to be turned off again once the losses start to mount.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The perversity of stock markets is a wonderful thing. With the economic news
from France worsening by the day, the CAC-40 index last week surged through
the 2,000 barrier, adding the gloss to an 8 per cent rise since the start of
the year. Yesterday's elections were the proximate cause; the anticipation
of interest rate cuts the broader justification.
The tide of euphoria surrounding the incoming market-friendly government
looks likely to last a while. The CAC's all-time high of 2,129 may yet be
breached this year with the conservatives keen to show they can make a
better fist of the economy than the Socialists. The government's
privatisation programme could raise more than FFr20bn (Pounds 2.5bn) this
year to fund a spot of reflation. The commitment to the franc fort should
remain solid. Nevertheless, France's fine inflation record could permit
interest rates to fall from 11 per cent to 6 per cent by the year-end.
Much depends, though, on the speed with which German interest rates drop. If
the Bundesbank moves too slowly, high interest rates will inflict real
damage on the French economy. Economic growth is stalling. The recent dismal
stream of corporate news suggests earnings and dividends will come under
severe pressure. The strong franc has thrown grit into France's export
machine. The equity market is gambling that, if the Bundesbank proves too
grudging, the franc fort policy will face the guillotine.

FT  29 MAR 93 / The Lex Column: High street demolition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kingfisher's results last week showed clearly how the new accounting
standards will cut retailers' profits. Until now companies could revalue
properties in their balance sheets, and also count the full difference
between the original purchase price and the disposal price as a profit.
Companies conveniently did well both ways. Property revaluations
strengthened the balance sheet while disposal gains flattered the profit and
loss account.
Now profits - or losses - are measured on the difference between carrying
cost in the balance sheet and sale price. For Kingfisher the change turned a
profit of Pounds 20.6m on property in 1991-92 into a loss of Pounds 11.4m.
The problem particularly affects groups with large long-standing property
holdings. Woolworth's high street stores and Sears' shoe shops are good
examples. Indeed, Sears is the retailer most affected by the change. It
realised property gains of Pounds 92m in 1991 and 1992 - some 40 per cent of
reported profits. Those profits will be substantially lower when restated on
the new basis. Sears' decision to cut its dividend last year thus looks to
have been all the more inevitable given that the payment was not even
covered before the change.
Large investors have in the main stripped out such profits from their
calculations. Smaller investors may be more shocked by the change - however
much companies try to pretend that it is merely technical. Other sectors may
also be in for a surprise. The brewing and leisure sectors have similar
property portfolios, yet the full significance of the change does not yet
appear to have sunk in.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's Washington trip by Helmut Kohl has complicated matters for his
staff in Germany. Some of them have wagered that their chancellor will be 14
kilos lighter on returning from his annual visit to an Austrian spa, due to
begin on Wednesday.
But now he has been to the US, the decisive question is not how much he will
weigh after the spa holiday, but the weight at which he'll start it.
Suspicions that he increased his bulk while in Washington are strengthened
by onlookers' impressions that he was there not so much to meet the new US
president as to renew his own acquaintance with a favourite restaurant:
Filomena's in Georgetown. Certainly, hobnobbing before a White House meeting
on Friday, he could talk of little else.
As a result Bill Clinton, who has proved himself more than a McDonalds man
with recent appearances in several of Washington's trendier restaurants,
added Filomena's to his list.
He might have done better to note the address of the spa.

Meanwhile the environment secretary Michael Howard has just received an
invitation which presents him with a dilemma. Sent by Robin Smith - general
manager of Copeland borough council in that remote corner of England, West
Cumbria - it requests him to visit the town of Whitehaven.
If Howard turns up, he is sure to be lobbied for extra state aid for the
area, not least because its road, rail and air links are inadequate. Yet if
he cries off as he did when last invited, sending junior colleague Tony
Baldry instead, he'll not only leave local citizens in no doubt that the
government is snubbing them, but help to prove the point they're seeking to
make.
Scheduled ministerial visits have also been called off by housing minister
Sir George Young and board of trade president Michael Heseltine as well as
Howard's other junior colleague Robin Squire.
'It underlines that we're the most remote travel-to-work area in England
from Whitehall,' says Smith. 'Not only does that make it difficult for
government ministers to get to us; it makes it difficult for businessmen
too.'

Whatever Britain may be short of, it is evidently not people with 'an
impressive track-record in senior management, knowledge of the property
market and extensive experience in land regeneration or a related field'.
Almost 200 such paragons - in their own view, at any rate - have applied to
become the first chief executive of the government's new Urban Regeneration
Agency. Among so many, there may even be one be deemed worth more than the
advertised salary of Pounds 90,000.
Charged with 'unleashing the potential' of 150,000 acres of derelict and
vacant land in England's towns and cities, the body will take over the work
of English Estates, the government's industrial and commercial property
developer, besides some of the grant programmes run by the environment
department.
Since England's 11 Urban Development Corporations are mostly scheduled for
scrapping before long, it seems likely that some of their chief executives
are among the 200 contenders. Alas, those questioned on the point proved
uncharacteristically shy.
Not so, however, the man already doing what is largely the job newly
offered: Tony Pender, chief executive of English Estates for the past 14
years. 'I'm naturally going to have a go at it,' he said. As for having such
hordes seeking to trample over him, 'it's uncomfortable, but the discomfort
was expected.'

Perhaps it should be called 'The Beautiful and the Dammed'. According to
vibes emanating from Los Angeles, narcissistic pop-star Michael Jackson is
to join disgraced junk bond financier Michael Milken in a new cable TV
network which will seemingly focus on 'education and entertainment'.
Don't rush to tune in, though. True, Milken has completed a two-year jail
sentence after pleading guilty to six counts of securities fraud. But he has
yet to perform 1,800 hours of community service in each of the next three

Debts of honour don't seem to be much recognised these days, let alone
remembered after nigh half a century. All credit, then, to a group of
British wrinklies preparing to return to northern Somalia, where they
soldiered in the years just after the second world war.
The aim of the party, led by Anglo-Somali Society chairman Brigadier Malcolm
Page, is at least partly to redeem what they see as the UK government's
neglect of its obligations to former allies in the old British Somaliland
Protectorate, now the self-proclaimed but unrecognised Somaliland Republic.
The debt is not just to the 1,000 or so Somali ex-servicemen and war widows
remaining from 1939-45, says group member Cameron Morpeth, a retired
stockbroker who served as a subaltern in the protectorate. The ties go back
to the survivors' grandfathers who fought alongside British troops in
Dervish campaigns at the turn of the century.
'We shouldn't leave this strongly British-oriented people to the vagaries of
UN action. They haven't had a fair share of the aid given to southern
Somalia,' he adds.
So far Rimfire, a British company running mine-clearing operations, has
offered to help him on arrival. Millride golf club raised Pounds 1,500, and
the British Commonwealth Ex-Services League has promised small grants. 'That
will help some of the hardest hit, including war widows in a country
devasted as a direct result of cold war rivalries,' says Morpeth. 'But we
should do more.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / ECB very much on drawing board
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite the clouds over the Maastricht treaty and European Monetary Union,
preparations for establishing the new European Central Bank in Stage Three
are going ahead. The treaty itself goes into detail about the constitution
and responsibilities of the bank, but says little about how it will operate.
Forward thinking on these matters has, however, been taking place under the
aegis of the EC Committee of Central Bank Governors, which has already set
up a small staff of its own; the committee itself is likely to be taken over
by the European Monetary Institute when the latter is established in January
1994 under Stage Two of Emu.
Further light on how the ECB might operate is shed by two members of the
central bankers' staff, Carlo Monticelli and Jose Vinals in a paper entitled
European Monetary Policy in Stage Three, soon to be published by the Centre
for Economic Policy Research.
Monetary policy, we are usefully reminded, centres round the supply of
'central bank money', which in UK parlance corresponds to bankers' balances
at the Bank of England. This should be targeted according to the authors,
not on any final objective, like a price index or Nominal GDP, but on some
intermediate target, in practice, a measure of the money supply.
Discussion of the paper at a recent conference in Barcelona made clear that
the only measures of money supply likely to be used were fairly broad ones
covering a wide range of bank deposits, as well as cash, such as Britain's
M4 or the German M3. A subsequent paper by the Bank of England's economic
director, Mervyn King, has a chart hinting that the relation between the
British M4 and inflation, which broke down in the early 1980s, might be
about to re-establish itself.
One argument is that money supply targeting would provide some continuity
with national central banks, several of which already target the money
supply. Furthermore, money supply targets respond more quickly to policy
than inflation itself and are easier to monitor, which would help to
establish the credibility of the ECB in its vital early years. The
successful pursuit of monetary targets might also exert a favourable
influence on private sector expectations and behaviour, while the setting of
ranges rather than joint targets should allow some flexibility for the new
institution.
A more interesting argument, emphasised even more by Professor Ronald
McKinnon of Stanford university, is that the relation of the European money
supply to incomes and prices could well be more stable than that for
existing national currencies, as substitution between them would cancel out.
The EC paper also suggests that there are limits to how far the
implementation of monetary policies can be delegated to the component
central banks. For instance reserve requirements (virtually non-existent in
the UK) would have to be harmonised. On the other hand, each national centre
could maintain its own standing facilities with national banks.
However, conditions for the recognition of banks would have to be well
harmonised to prevent the authorities in each national capital from trying
to promote its own financial centre at the expense of others.
My own worry is how we get from here to there. It does not seem to me
conceivable that up to, say, December 31 1998, the Bundesbank will decide
its policies with sole reference to securing low inflation in Germany; and
then on January 1 1999, the European Central Bank will take over with the
different objective of stabilising European Community prices.
There must surely be an intermediate stage when the still-independent
central banks work together with an eye to the European price level, and
perhaps experiment with some measure of the European money supply.
Prof McKinnon has advocated a 'common monetary standard' under which the
core ERM countries would co-ordinate monetary policies to achieve zero
inflation for a common producer price index. His aim is to rehabilitate the
European exchange rate mechanism; but it would be equally appropriate as a
prelude to full Emu, or as a way of maintaining exchange rate stability
while keeping options open.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Trade apostle with his eye on the ball: Mickey Kantor talks
to Jurek Martin and Nancy Dunne about his daunting agenda in pursuit of open
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pride may come before a fall, but there is no denying that there is a
certain cockiness to the Clinton administration these days. Congress has
been tamed, the press charmed, Yeltsin is still there and visiting foreign
dignitaries impressed - all if only for the moment.
More than that, a certain style has been established. It combines collegial,
activist, legalistic, inquiring and practical elements. It takes its lead,
indisputably, from President Bill Clinton himself but it is equally evident
in other key members of his administration.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC trade commissioner, will get a heightened sense of
it this morning when he sits down with Mickey Kantor, the US trade
repesentative, to work on a daunting agenda, of which EC procurement policy
and temporarily suspended US sanctions against it is merely the most
pressing. He will find on the opposite side of the table a man more assured
and more comfortable with his brief than when they first met last month.
Mr Kantor, 53, born in Tennessee, where his family fought racial
discrimination, but enamoured of his adopted California ('the closest we've
got to a meritocracy'), a poverty and corporate lawyer who ran Mr Clinton's
professional campaign last year, gets up early, wears braces, and has a
subtle sense of humour.
Though it may come as no help to Sir Leon, Mr Kantor is, like most sensible
Americans, a baseball freak. Last week's breakfast bagel was forgotten in
discussing the revived fortunes of Fernando Valenzuela, the pitcher who
relies on guile not force, but the trade analogies are not.
'Velocity in pitching, like philosophy in trade,' Mickey Kantor declares,
'is vastly overrated. It's all about location and staying ahead of the
batters, that's how you'll be successful. Its not complicated, just like
trade is not complicated. There are simple principles to adhere to.' (On his
desk was a clipping from a Japanese newspaper showing Mr Yoshiro Mori, the
trade minister whom Mr Kantor was to meet later, playing baseball.)
Yet when pressed if he cares more about ends than means, the lawyer demurs.
'Once you sign an agreement it seems to me almost counter-intuitive, even
dysfunctional not to live up to it.' Nations have anti-dumping laws which,
far from being necessarily skewed in favour of the plaintiff, exist 'because
there is a lot of dumping around'.
However, laws, even in trade, are not, he goes on, set in concrete. 'Change
is the immutable law of politics and life. Change can be your friend.' In
perhaps a veiled invitation to the EC to come back to the table for a
multilateral steel agreement, 'if your trading partner comes to you and says
he can't live up to the terms of an agreement, you can talk'. Intensified
negotiation, he argues, is what should have been done last year, possibly
avoiding the US finding that European steel imports had been dumped in the
US. 'I'm always looking for the dog that doesn't bark.'
If the rules of the game fascinate him, trade theology does not. 'I'm not
going to be caught in a theological debate that does not lead to practical
and pragmatic results. It does not matter what you are called or how you are
labelled, it matters what we get done. The idea is not to engage in endless
debate about whether someone is a free trader, a protectionist, a managed
trader or results oriented.'
He makes just one dogmatic exception. The US 'is the largest open market in
the world, and it is not going to change and everyone knows that. The
rhetoric thrown around is only for effect, lets be mature and grown up about
that.'
He is inclined, naturally, to be more tolerant of US rhetoric for domestic
consumption ('the political factor'), such as his own president has used
when discoursing about European Airbus subsidies or the presumed iniquity of
low US tariffs on Japanese mini-vans.
He contrasts that, perhaps ingenuously, certainly defensively, with 'when
the EC talks about protectionism and unilateralism, whatever the heck that
means, that is somehow supposed to embarrass us and persuade us to take
action that is in the interest of the EC or the Japanese or whoever is
making the charges'.
But, he goes on, it would be 'audacious' to try to make a country like Japan
be just like the US, which was arguably a motive in the Structural
Impediments Initiative approach to market-opening practised by the Bush
administration. 'It is not my business to tell them how to organise society.
You take the keiretsu (the Japanese system of interlocking corporate
networks) as a given and try to make it effective. It is my business to
ensure that markets become more open.'
Those caveats aside, Mr Kantor can be critical of Japan. For starters:
'Japan can no longer stand aside and not engage in discussion on the Uruguay
Round; this is not 45 years ago.' For main course: 'They don't need any
protection from us or anybody else.' For semiconductor dessert: 'I think
their lack of comfort (with the US insistence on quantitative targets) could
be more concerned with other criteria, including politics.' For good reason,
he is concerned that the 20 per cent market-opening 'goal' of the
semiconductor agreement will not be met this year.
The EC gets a generally similar ride, with lots of compliments for its
historic leadership. But 'I don't understand why market access should be
such a difficut problem. They should jump at the opportunities. The Germans,
the English, the Dutch have been traders for centuries.'
'Barriers,' he goes on, 'are not in anybody's interests. Agricultural
variable levies, internal supports, the CAP, are not in anybody's interest.
I'm not telling them how to handle it - that's not my business - but I do
have the right and obligation to tell them what is in the interest of the
US.' On the discrimination of EC procurement policies, he says, more
colloquially, 'if I'm punching you, punching less does not matter'.
Critics of the emerging US trade policy contend that too many officials
punch too often and in inconsistent flurries, unlike the good old days when
it was neatly compartmentalised between a handful of administration
'experts' who believed, whatever they actually did, that trade should be
free, and a Democratic-controlled Congress which played the protectionist
foil.
Mr Kantor is an apostle of the horizontal approach to policy-making.
Corporations and governments have found, he says, that it improves
co-ordination. 'Now, Treasury, State, Commerce, the National Economic
Council, the National Security Council, USTR are constantly talking. There's
a Tuesday morning meeting every week, horizontal discussions all the time.
It takes a lot of discipline . . . but we talk so that we are all singing
from the same hymn book.' (This is a phrase in vogue in Washington: even
Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, was caught mouthing it here
last week.)
It works, he contends, because the president himself is 'completely
engaged,' reading memoranda all the time and knowing his brief as well as
any of his officials. His respect for his boss, whom he first met in 1979
through Mrs Hillary Rodham Clinton, knows no bounds.
But if he takes his lead from Mr Clinton, he can argue his own way. 'What
appears from my studies and intuition is that the sum is greater than the
parts. Exponential growth takes place from interaction between economies.'
But the benefits, in improved standards of living, must be widely spread at
home and abroad.
He talks of extending the North American Free Trade Area southwards and then
into co-operation with the Pacific basin, all with a view to creating
'middle classes in the world'. In this respect, his early career as a
poverty lawyer, representing the lowest of the low, migrant farm labour in
Florida and then California, was influential.
Referring to Cesar Chavez, the charismatic leader of farm labour in the
1960s and 1970s: 'He profoundly affected my view of what needed to be done,
how important it was to throw yourself into public issues and, now, how
important Nafta is in harmonising upwards workers' standards'.
But he has his own ideal of where those standards are most perfectly found.
A modest traveller ('I didn't make much as a legal services lawyer') he has
been to Europe 'a few times' and to Israel. In his present job: 'I'd love to
hold every meeting in Florence.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Spoils of the North Sea
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY TAX reform as sweeping as the chancellor's new fiscal regime for North
Sea oil inevitably creates winners and losers. The more important question
is whether it creates the right incentives to ensure that maximum economic
benefit is extracted from the dwindling energy resources that remain. Since
the present arrangements are excessively complex, incorporate inadequate
incentives for companies to control costs, and are ill-designed for a period
in which many North Sea oil fields are reaching maturity, the reforms
probably have more to commend them than the complaints of the smaller oil
producers might suggest. But if form is any guide, they will not produce
quite as stable a long-term regime as the chancellor predicts.
Under the old regime, only a small number of fields paid PRT at all and most
of these were older fields. This was because exploration and appraisal costs
could be off-set against the income from existing fields, thereby reducing
or eliminating the charge to petroleum revenue tax (PRT) and corporation
tax. The effect was to cut the cost of exploration and appraisal to less
than 17p in the pound, which provided a powerful incentive for drilling
activity. But the tax take from existing fields, which suffered from a
combined rate of royalty and tax charges of just over 85 per cent, provided
a countervailing disincentive to further development. As a result there was
a risk that substantial energy resources would be left untapped. This has
led to suggestions from some larger companies, which are responsible for
about 80 per cent of the development of existing fields, that the
exploration tail has been allowed to wag the development dog. It has also
led to a great deal of lobbying.
Underlying logic
In his budget package, the chancellor appears to have bought the big
companies' argument. A reduction in the rate of PRT from 75 per cent to 50
per cent means that the combined tax rate for those existing fields that pay
royalty and corporation tax as well as PRT will fall from 85 per cent to
nearer 70 per cent. And it is hard to quarrel with the underlying logic,
given that the current rate of PRT was set when the oil price was three
times higher in real terms and costs were significantly lower. The more
difficult question is whether the accompanying abolition of PRT relief on
exploration and appraisal costs, together with the switch to corporation tax
on new fields, will lead to an undesirable reduction in the amount of
exploration activity.
Unhappy timing
North Sea exploration has already been falling for predictable reasons: the
odds on drilling successfully, according to British Petroleum, have gone
from one in four to one in seven over the past five years. Exploration is
understandably gravitating to more attractive prospects elsewhere. Judging
by the initial reaction of many independent oil companies, this trend will
accelerate. But the fact that the PRT regime has actually been costing the
exchequer money poses a question about whether the government may now be
subsidising sub-optimal investment in the North Sea. Certainly the reforms
mean that future exploration will be more cost conscious; but because the
prize to be had from developing new fields will be greater under corporation
tax rules than before, the Treasury's calculation must be that drilling will
continue where the prospects of significant finds are best. From negative
PRT revenues of Pounds 200m in 1991-92, the Treasury expects an inflow of
Pounds 300m in 1994-5 and Pounds 400m thereafter.
It is nonetheless worrying that the hard-pressed independent sector, which
has performed a useful role in the North Sea, is being so obviously
disadvantaged relative to the giants of the industry - and hardly surprising
that independent companies are distrustful of the Treasury's motives. The
timing of the chancellor's move also looks unhappy, given the adverse job
consequences at a time of rising unemployment. That said, the broad thrust
of the tax reforms is right for a North Sea that is reaching maturity. But
if the suspicion that the Treasury's revenue calculations are based on
over-optimistic assumptions about the future level of exploration proves
right, the new corporation tax regime will no doubt grow complications just
as readily the old PRT did.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Leading Article: Mixed message for French right
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEEPING election victory of the French conservatives has delivered two
contradictory messages, which could lead them to adopt two opposite
strategies of government. The simple message is that the electorate has
handed down a categoric rejection of the discredited Socialist party, and
given the conservatives a licence to charge ahead with a populist right-wing
programme, even if this involves getting into fights with the US over trade,
with the Community over farm policy, and with President Mitterrand over his
constitutional position. But there is a deeper message, less exhilarating
for the right, which should prompt them to adopt a cautious and even a
conciliatory posture.
The case for caution is three-fold: the conservatives do not really have a
popular mandate for a hard-line right-wing programme; they have not offered
any rapid solutions for the country's economic problems, starting with the
apparently inexorable rise in unemployment; and the electorate will not
thank them if they gratuitously rush into a dead-end political crisis with
France's trading partners, or an unnecessary constitutional crisis at home.
The conservatives' popular base is more modest than their parliamentary
majority would suggest. The collapse of the Socialist vote is almost wholly
accounted for by the rise in the protest parties outside the governing
mainstream, such as the extreme right-wing National Front and the
ecologists. The conservatives' share of the ballot in the first round of
this election - less than 40 per cent - was slightly smaller than in 1981,
which must make it imprudent, therefore, for them to interpret a massive
parliamentary majority as a massive popular mandate.
Popular alienation
This election thus confirms the existence of a strong under-current of
popular alienation from the traditional parties of government, which first
emerged in last year's regional elections. One factor is no doubt the
Socialists' failure to stem the tide of unemployment; another is the
tainting of the Socialist party by systematic involvement in corrupt
financing practices. But the Socialists' fatal offence was to have succumbed
to the arrogance of power.
Like the Gaullists before them, the Socialists have systematically
monopolised the patronage of the state, supping deep from the privilege of
presidential power, and becoming increasingly remote from ordinary people.
This is a direct consequence of a system where the authority of the
president has progressively overshadowed that of government and parliament.
There is a clear need for a rebalancing of the system in favour of
parliament, and the modest constitutional reforms proposed by President
Mitterrand could be a useful move in that direction.
The conservatives' most acute dilemma is in economic policy. They subscribe
to the same anti-inflationary objectives, and the same hard franc policy, as
the Socialists. But there is an irreconcilable conflict in the short term
between their need to bring down unemployment, and the deflationary effect
of high German interest rates. They have promised a new initiative to
accelerate Franco-German monetary co-operation. But if this fails to bring
lower interest rates and the promise of faster growth, they will probably
need to re-open the European debate on economic and monetary union.
Guiding principles
There is a danger that this dilemma will play into the hands of the
populists and the anti-Europeans in the conservative coalition. In fact, the
only sound general strategy for France is one centrally based on the
European Community, on the liberal market economy, and on the key
relationship with Germany.
The best guarantee that these will continue to be the guiding principles of
French policy will be the appointment of a prime minister who is prudent,
pragmatic and reasonable. Speculation has suggested that Mr Mitterrand will
choose Mr Edouard Balladur, the former finance minister, who said last week
that the new government should be 'as open, as tolerant, and as respectful
of others as possible'. Mr Balladur is not the only plausible candidate; but
that is exactly the style of government which France needs at this delicate,
and potentially unstable, point in its political history.

<TEXT>
Sir, Here we go again. Not long ago, the west was backing one side in its
desire to establish a system which it preferred.
Then it was Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, now it is Boris Yeltsin
in Russia. When is the west going to stop trying to impose its own system in
other lands?
The Russians must be fed up - continuous promises of assistance and nothing
forthcoming. Nothing, that is, except meddling in their internal affairs.
Capitalism and democracy will only ever become ingrained if the Russian
people themselves are committed and become accustomed to these ways of life
voluntarily.
If they look at how capitalism and democracy are functioning in other parts
of the world they may not consider worthwhile the hardship which they have
to undergo to get theirs.
The west should lead by example not by intervention. Until it does, when the
time comes for people to look for bright torches to follow, they will
by-pass the western fool's gold and prospect elsewhere.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Letter: Tax proposals will hit small oil exploration
companies while benefiting large producers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr MICHAEL F RIDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Since the chancellor's budget statement your pages have carried the
reactions of two of the biggest North Sea oil companies to the proposed
changes in the Petroleum Revenue Tax arrangements ('North Sea group may
halve exploration after oil tax change', March 24). At the other end of the
spectrum is a company like my own, arguably the smallest North Sea oil
company and yet one which would be strongly affected if the chancellor's
proposals were to be implemented.
Over several rounds of North Sea licensing Croft has built up a portfolio of
exploration acreage, committing to the government to carry out certain
seismic surveys and drilling. Our plans and commitments had been based on a
fiscal regime in which our exploration and appraisal costs could be relieved
against our PRT liability from the one producing field we have, Claymore.
Under the chancellor's proposals the work we shall have to carry out under
those commitments to government will effectively quadruple in cost. And,
similarly, any discretionary exploration or appraisal work we might wish to
carry out in the UK will be made that much more costly. Expressed another
way, from 1996 when the PRT changes would begin to bite, our North Sea
production revenue (and hence the money available for exploration) will
halve.
That is how a company largely devoted to exploration and appraisal will be
affected. But certain other North Sea oil companies have such large
producing interests and pay such large PRT bills that their effective
increase in exploration and appraisal costs under the chancellor's proposals
will be outweighed by the chancellor's other proposal, to reduce the PRT
rate on existing fields from 75 to 50 per cent. Such companies, although few
in number, are naturally rejoicing as your March 25 headline points out: 'BP
defends oil tax from attacks.'
Mr John Browne of BP is reported as saying that for too long the taxpayer
has subsidised exploration. The reason he is now rejoicing is because the
chancellor is proposing that in future the taxpayer will instead foot the
bill for BP's increase in North Sea revenue, estimated at up to Pounds 140m
a year.
Mr Browne is one of the few North Sea oil company executives to consider
exploration levels will not be seriously affected by the proposed changes,
reportedly saying that instead it will give exploration a stronger focus and
make it more cost-effective. If drilling success rates have declined from 1
in 5 to 1 in 7, as he says, it is not because of inefficient exploration but
because with advancing maturity the North Sea is yielding smaller
discoveries of which more are falling beneath the threshold of commercial
viability. 'Stronger focus' is simply a euphemism for cutting the number of
wells drilled, and fewer wells will mean fewer commercially viable
discoveries.
The government estimates that up to 25bn barrels of oil and 44 trillion
cubic feet of gas may remain to be discovered in the UK. Finding those
reserves will require sustained high levels of exploration. On the whole,
over the past 30 years the fiscal regime has been conducive to such
exploration - that could now change. Michael F Ridd,

FT  29 MAR 93 / Letter: Clear duties and penalties the route to auditor
independence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DEREK RIDYARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Prem Sikka, Anthony Puxty and Hugh Willmott (Accountancy Column, March
25) add their voices to the popular argument that separation of audit from
consultancy work for the same client would ensure auditor independence.
Judging by the research carried out by NERA into this subject, I would
suggest that their proposals are unworkable. What is more, this policy
prescription is not at all the most direct solution to the root of the
problem.
When we collected data on audit-consultancy links among the Big Six
accounting firms in 1990, we found that the various regulatory obstacles to
such links throughout the EC were mostly ignored, avoided or evaded. In
Germany (the example cited by Sikka et al as having an effective ban on
audit-consultancy links) we found that more than 20 per cent of Big Six
non-audit income came from audit clients. The corresponding figure was 35
per cent for the UK.
Even supposing audit-consultancy links could be eradicated, the problem of
the auditors owing greater financial allegiance to the managers than to the
shareholders of the audit client would remain. The audit is a major piece of
business in its own right, so audit partners would still have a clear
financial incentive to compromise independence if lent on by unscrupulous
company managers.
The way to tackle this problem head on is to clarify the duties of the
auditor to the shareholders. Clearer duties, and clearer penalties if these
duties were not discharged, would provide an effective financial antidote to
the incentive to compromise independence. Certain knowledge that poor audit
checks will result in exposure to proper penalties would concentrate the
auditor's mind wonderfully.
Shareholders' representatives, and the accounting firms themselves, should
take more rapid steps towards this goal if they are to avoid the imposition
of costly and ineffectual interference with their freedom to carry on
consultancy work.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Personal View: The unwritten code of lasting business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN KAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Why is it that, when data transmission has become instantaneous and cheap,
world financial centres are still concentrated in tiny areas of Manhattan
and central London? Why is entertainment such a central element in Japanese
business culture? Why is it that the way to revive the British motor
industry is to shut down most of its traditional plants and re-start on
greenfield sites? Why are the most successful parts of Italian industry
based on local networks of small, co-operating companies? And how did banks
manage to lose quite so much money in the past two decades?
The answers to all these questions are to be found in the different styles
of business contracts and relationships that companies employ, and in the
ways these depend on history and social environment. Long-term contracts are
needed when parties need to make a substantive commitment to the
relationship. A company needs to fit out an office to its specific needs; a
sub-contractor needs to tool up for a particular component; an effective
professional adviser needs to invest in knowing his client. No one will make
these commitments on the basis of spot contacts alone.
One possibility is to make a classical contract - a binding agreement which
specifies what will happen in every foreseeable contingency. That is how we
rent property. But is has disadvantages. Not all contingencies are
foreseeable. And there are aspects of a commercial relationship which the
courts cannot, or will not, enforce. No contract can effectively prescribe
for the full exchange of information or for flexibility in response.
There is a difference between the degree of co-operation which can be
enforced by rules and the wholeheartedly concerted action of two individuals
or two companies. It is the difference between a relationship with the local
telephone company and the relationship with a marriage partner. We make a
classical contract with the former, we have a relational contract with the
other. The relational contract will have a legal form (as the marriage
contract does), but (as with the marriage contract) it does not incorporate
the essential elements of the relationship. These elements are implicit, and
are enforced, not by any legal process, but by the need of the parties to go
on doing business together.
Relational contracts are important in business too. They are necessary in
areas where information exchange is important and where quick and flexible
responses are necessary. That is why they matter in the financial services
industry, in fashion businesses and in industries which assemble the
products of a wide range of independent companies. They are the key to the
competitive advantages of such companies as JP Morgan and Cazenove, Benetton
and Christian Dior, Toyota and Marks and Spencer.
Relational contracts involve risks as well as rewards. Each party is exposed
to the risk of opportunistic behaviour by the other and the only protection
they have is the reputation of the other and the shared need for a
continuing relationship. The ability to make relational contracts
effectively depends on the environment in which the company is placed. It is
easier to make relational contracts when the relational style is the norm,
safer to do it with someone who has made many other relational contracts.
The Japanese business culture is naturally supportive of relational
contracting and the familiar pillars of Japanese management systems, with
their emphasis on seniority, their practices of lifetime employment and
their networks of sub-contractors, are all part of that. The American
environment, in which the penalties for opportunistic behaviour are very low
and everyone has an attorney at his shoulder, is naturally hostile to it.
Italy is at one European end of this spectrum and Britain at the other.
Geographical concentration and linking of social activities with commercial
ones is important. Opportunistic behaviour is more costly if it damages your
social as well as commercial reputation.
Relational contracting is not all good. The features of Japanese and Italian
life which make these types of business behaviour possible are also
reflected in nepotism and political corruption. Life run by unwritten rules
can be constraining on talent and inhibiting on innovation.
The US - an individualistic society founded on immigrants who had discarded
many traditional values - provides the most innovative technical and
commercial environment in the world. It is also the most litigious society,
and competitive advantages based on design and style, or on the sustained
co-operation of a disciplined labour force, are mostly found elsewhere.
There are business areas where relational contracting is appropriate, and
others where classical contracting performs better; we need to know which is
which.
Yet we may not have a choice. It is easier to move away from relational
contracts than towards them. UK banks were ready to discard such contracts
with their customers and employees in the pursuit of a more commercial,
performance-oriented transactional style of business. They paid a high
price, but they cannot now put these relationships together again. Nor could
Longbridge and Cowley substitute the co-operative history of Toyota's plants
for their own.
For many people relational contracts seem an old-fashioned way of doing
business. In reality it is a style of commercial relationship which we
discard at our peril.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Too many bodies spoil the broth: A look at the duplication
of effort in promoting London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is London's government being privatised? This morning a private-sector
organisation - with the blessing of the environment secretary, Mr Michael
Howard - will publish plans to promote London as a location for business and
an international tourist centre.
The proposals will be launched by London Forum, a private-sector initiative
to provide the UK's capital with a shop window in which the city's wares can
be set out to the world.
The forum is a sister organisation to another private-sector body, London
First, which aspires to provide the strategic thinking needed to maintain
and enhance the reputation of London as a world-class city.
The organisations share a chairman, Grand Metropolitan's Sir Allen Sheppard,
and a chief executive, Mr Stephen O'Brien, vice-president of Business in the
Community. Both are attempts to fill the vacuum left by the absence of an
elected city-wide or regional body to represent London and to develop the
strategic planning essential for a large city. A string of reports, from
organisations such as the now-defunct National Economic Development
Organisation, have repeatedly identified the absence of such a body as an
impediment to improving London's competitive position as a world city.
The absence of strategic planning is potently symbolised by the state of the
capital's transport infrastructure. Indisputably, transport is one of the
most important ingredients in making a city an efficient and agreeable place
in which to live and work. Yet in London, public transport is perceived as
overcrowded, unreliable, underfunded and overpriced; on the roads, only
recession has stopped congestion from bringing traffic to the brink of
paralysis.
Inevitably, Londoners look to neighbouring capitals for comparisons. When
they do, they find London scoring badly. Paris, for example, may suffer even
worse traffic jams than London, but Londoners can only stand in awe of
Paris's commitment to public transport.
Not only is the Metro more frequent and reliable than the Underground, but
three cross-city lines have been built since 1987, a fourth is under
construction, a fifth is planned, and FFr71bn (Pounds 8.9bn) is due to be
spent as part of an expansion plan spanning the next 20 years.
By comparison, investment in new transport capacity in central London has
virtually halted. Road building has long been ruled out as a solution to the
capital's transport problems, but little has happened to take its place. The
bus fleet is ageing, the Underground system is decaying faster than it is
being renewed, and apart from a short stretch of the Jubilee Line, only one
new Underground line (the Victoria line) has been built since the first
world war.
Central Londoners can only look with envy at examples of what the government
can do when it tries. In the Docklands area on the capital's eastern flank,
some Pounds 3.5bn is being spent on a co-ordinated effort to stimulate
regeneration through big improvements in transport infrastructure.
And further east, the government is now talking of developing a linear city
down the east Thames corridor stretching from Docklands into north Kent.
This means further vast sums will need to be spent on roads and railways
outside the central area. To many, this looks perverse: a sort of transport
equivalent of adding a luxurious new extension to a house whose roof is
caving in.
Last year the government sought to counter accusations that it had no
policies for transport in the centre of the capital by appointing Mr Steven
Norris as minister for transport in London.
Mr Norris reels off a list of projects that he says will transform London's
public transport: CrossRail, the Jubilee Line extension, Thameslink 2000,
the East London Line extension, the Channel tunnel rail link, the Heathrow
Express, the Chelsea-Hackney line. And he rejects suggestions that Paris
does things better: 'This idea that everything is better across the Channel
is simply untrue.'
The capital itself, however, seems far from convinced. A report published by
the Corporation of London, the local authority for the City of London,
earlier this month pointed out how the decision-making process on new
transport projects was split between a 'staggering' number of government
departments, quangos, borough joint committees, representative organisations
and the London boroughs themselves. Once agreed, the report said, these
projects then became subject to the vagaries of the national public
expenditure control process.
'There is little evidence that new central government arrangements have yet
succeeded where earlier planning and governance systems failed,' it
concluded.
The creation of private sector bodies such as the London Forum and London
First is seen as the way forward by the government. To back its efforts, a
cabinet subcommittee on London, chaired by the environment secretary, was
created last year to co-ordinate policy.
However, the creation of more bodies to promote the capital looks set to
perpetuate the division of effort between disparate, sometimes overlapping
and occasionally competing organisations, none of which can claim
leadership.
Already there has been some discontent at the City Corporation over the
duplication of effort created by the plethora of bodies.
One of London First's projects, for example, is a study of London's economic
competitiveness, under a group chaired by Mr Stuart Hampson, chairman of the
John Lewis Partnership, the retailer. The corporation is almost half-way
through a Pounds 1.5m study on the same subject by the London Business
School, which is producing a steady stream of papers such as the transport
one already published.
Similarly, the corporation cannot be a formal member of the London Forum,
since Mr Howard excluded local authorities from membership. Yet the
corporation is one of the few bodies in London which can provide substantial
funds, staff and other resources for the Forum's work.
Mr Michael Cassidy, chairman of the corporation's policy and resources
committee, says that there is a danger that Londoners will be disappointed
if the new body cannot launch its plans with an element of punchiness
because it has no resources. They will be bringing 'little new to the
party', he says, except for added profile.
However, such arguments over turf beg the bigger question as to whether it
is appropriate for such important strategic planning to be left to private
sector organisations without adequate resources.
London First, for example, is backed by some 40 companies, each of which has
chipped in Pounds 5,000 apiece to fund its work. These sums are paltry in
relation the amounts which would be needed to address London's underlying
problems.
This privatisation of London's governance will only work if it opens the
Treasury's purse strings. It has yet to be proved that it can.

The working day is over; you settle down on the old green sofa with a large
glass of Graham's '75 and prepare for . . . what? Judging from the
schedules, what the people in the television journalism departments assume
is that you want your heartstrings tugged to breaking point and your withers
thoroughly wrung. At World In Action, now more than ever on the tabloid
ratings trail, they are going to 'speak to the victims of violent abduction'
and 'expose the secret world of the child snatchers'. Won't that be nice
(8.30 ITV). Channel 4 offers an hour on being Down And Out In Paris And
London, (9.00) retracing the steps of George Orwell as he collected the
material for his famous book 60 years ago. For many homeless people, it is
said, nothing has changed since Orwell's (or, for that matter, Chaucer's)
day. Sounds cheery. Then at Panorama, where nowadays the motto all too often
seems to be: 'If it's boring it must be good', they promise to uncover
'explosive new evidence of crime, drug abuse and family breakdown in
Britain's once tightly-knit Muslim community' (9.30 BBC1). How super.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Arts: A spirit of eastern promise - The new European Bank in
London has a building to live up to
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Look East seems to be the motto of the moment. The inauguration last week of
the headquarters of the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, in
one of the recently completed office buildings of Broadgate, confirmed the
success of that development which has so effectively extended the City of
London to the east of Liverpool Street. Can it be a simple coincidence that
the approach to the entrance of the bank on Exchange Square from the station
is an elegant route called Great Eastern Walk? The role of the bank is to
foster development and democracy in the newly liberated countries of eastern
and central Europe, and as Mr Jaques Attali, the inspiring president of the
Bank, said at the inauguration, 'Europe is awakening to the east.' In the
same week Michael Howard, secretary of state for the environment, announced
proposals for the development of an East Thames Corridor along the marshy
and polluted banks of the Thames from Beckton to Sheerness. The question of
how best to awaken London to the east is almost as difficult a question as
how to achieve the rejuvenation of eastern Europe.
The importance of the European Bank and the wonder of it being in the City
of London was underlined in a very positive speech by HRH The Prince of
Wales when he inaugurated the new headquarters. He praised the decision of
the bank to establish a new European Cultural Fund and took the opportunity
to announce his own joint initiative with President Havel of the Czech
Republic to create a Prague Heritage Fund for the restoration of some of the
buildings, monuments and gardens of that remarkable city.
All this noble rhetoric seemed well grounded because it was issuing forth in
the fine new halls of what Mr Attali called, 'the first pan-European
institution of the post cold war era'. If the actual architecture of the
interiors of the new bank is anything to go by, the new Europe promises to
be both culturally stimulating and incredibly chic.
The architects for the interior of the building are an Anglo-French design
team, a partnership of Berthet et Pochy and Sidell Gibson. They have
achieved the remarkable feat of fitting out in record time a building
designed by the American architects Skidmore Owings and Merrill for
developer Mr Stuart Lipton (in his Rosehaugh Stanhope days). Broadgate
development. What struck me as particularly exciting was the way they have
completely transformed the whole idea of a banking environment. Their brief
from the president was to give a visual rendering of the diverse nature of
this international institution while making it possible for the open
teamwork of the operation to function efficiently.
The result is no cold and clinical routine set of offices but an open and
sparkling world with inventive spatial planning and an atmosphere that is
visually stimulating. The tone is set by the entrance hall - a great
mirrored space linking the Bishopsgate and Exchange Square entrances. The
ceiling is mirrored to reflect the marble floor and the hewn slabs of
Carrara marble that have been placed between the lifts. There are plans for
a video wall and a piece of the Berlin Wall to be at the Exchange Square
entrance. The cafe at the entrance level with an exhibition area will be
open to the public. (Its first big exhibition will be a display of religious
masterpieces from the State Museum of Sacred Art in St Petersburg, opening
in April.)
A large auditorium will house conferences and lectures and will also be the
setting for a series of cultural events sponsored by the bank. A line of
flags of member countries leads to the dramatic false perspective on the way
to the staff restaurant.
The 12 floors of offices have been planned to relate to one another both
horizontally and vertically. New internal staircases have been installed to
encourage easy communication between the departments that work together to
avoid dependence upon the well used lifts. The smaller top three floors
house the president's office, the boardroom and the executive dining and
meeting rooms. Many of these have remarkable views over Spitalfields and
east London. Looking down on the immediate neighbourhood of the former
Spitalfields market, which is dominated by the magnificent tower and spire
of Hawksmoor's Christ Church, it is hard to resist the idea that this should
become the newest residential area of the City instead of another sea of
offices. Residential developers - look east.
The main office floors have a rather spectacular sense of space - and
beautiful light sycamore furniture from the British firm of Gordon Russell.
Meeting rooms are circular with red doors all named after the rivers of
Europe. Tea and coffee areas are screened by glass panels etched with
entertaining designs. There are some enjoyable jokes in the bizarre conical
and pyramid signposts and the signs in the lobby areas which are engraved in
reverse and look Cyrillic until you read them the right way round in the
mirrored ceiling. When columns appear in large open spaces they have been
dramatically clad in very tactile rough metal casings.
The top floors have a restful and simple quality - the emphasis here is on
the quality of the materials and the display of some of the bank's art
collection. The dining rooms bear the names of European composers and some
will display memorabilia associated with the composers. Semi-precious stones
from the Urals, artefacts from eastern Europe, paintings and sculptures
combine to give the new offices something of an international intellectual
content. The Italian government have given a series of Piranesi engravings,
the developers have given the brilliant lion sculpture by Jane Ackroyd. A
giant fresco by a Russian, Polish and French group of artists will shortly
be unveiled, and a sculpture by Cesar has already been lent by the artist.
The high quality and the originality of the commissioned art works have
already given this new building a unique and distinguished character.
The European Bank is indeed welcome in London as a crucial and inventive
catalyst for the new Europe. If the creative atmosphere of culture and
commerce, which is so evident in the new headquarters, is indicative of its
approach to the rejuvenation of formerly communist Europe then the future in
the east will indeed be bright.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Arts: Russian piano duo - Recital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Wigmore Hall advertised a recital of Russian two-piano music by
Dmitri Alexeev and Nikolai Demidenko for last Saturday, some of their fans
may have felt anticipatory thrills. But cynical old hands like me had their
doubts. Part of what makes a successful virtuoso is a single-minded
determination to catch the ear; such performers usually collaborate more
easily with other instruments than with their own kind. Besides, Alexeev and
Demidenko would seem less than a natural match. Where intense feeling and
spontaneity characterise the one, the other cultivates perfection with
forethought. Yet in the event, their differences were all but submerged in a
shared passion for their native repertoire.
Though the occasion for the concert was the 50th anniversary of
Rakhmaninov's death, there is not quite enough two-piano music by that
composer, fortunately, to fill a programme. That made a good excuse for
jettisoning his Suite no. 1 and adding some unfamiliar Medtner, and a chain
of Schubert waltzes as arranged by Prokofiev. But Rakhmaninov carried the
evening after all; and a tingling account of the brilliant Second Suite was
certainly the crown of it.
His early Russian Rhapsody (1891) was at least interesting for its debt to
Balakirev and Borodin, St Petersburg nationalists whose echoes were more
often suppressed in Muscovite products such as Rakhmaninov's or Skryabin's.
In the two-piano version of the Symphonic Dances (1940, very late), some
quirks in the harmony sounded less plausible than in their opulent
orchestral disguise. Still, with playing of such devoted expertise one could
only sit back and enjoy.
Here and there, when Demidenko had an 'accompanying' role his awesome
authority made him rather too prominent, and in some prestissimo digital
passages Alexeev audibly scrambled. No other quibbles but to remark that
biological piano duos - the Kontarskys, the Contiguglia twins, the sisters
Labeque and Pekinel - have set a standard of eerie unanimity that few other
pairs can reach. Here, at phrase-ends and paragraph closes, Alexeev and
Demidenko were regularly a fraction of a second apart: they just are
different musical animals.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Arts: Stravinsky and Janacek - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Stravinsky's Symphony of Psalms and Janacek's Glagolitic Mass compare and
contrast wonderfully in a choral programme. It is not just the juxtaposition
of a great composer with a lesser light, nor the devout expression of faith
of a gnostic against the instinctive humanism of a confirmed atheist. These
two pieces written just four years apart (the Janacek first in 1926) provide
vertiginous differences of approach - the symphony's chaste discipline, the
Glagolitic's freely associating explosions of emotion - it is often hard to
believe they are such close contemporaries.
On Saturday the latest instalment of 'Towards the Millennium' brought the
two works to the Festival Hall with the City of Birmingham Symphony
Orchestra and its Chorus, conducted by Simon Rattle. Both were intense,
vivid performances - representing the very best of Rattle one is tempted to
say - with the Chorus, singing the mass from memory, wonderfully prepared
and ready to respond crisply to every nuance. If anything it was the
Stravinsky that emerged the more freshly minted; Rattle sifted and graded
the textures of the first movement with pinpoint accuracy, untangled the
fugal knots of the second, and gave an Apollonian elegance to the
repetitions of the third.
The exuberance of the Janacek was captured in a very different way, with
saturated orchestral splendour - bold, abrasive brass, high tensile strings,
explosive organ solos from Thomas Trotter - and a willingness to play for
high expressive stakes. Moments of over-exuberance sometimes threatened to
overwhelm the soloists, but Faye Robinson's soprano, a-quiver with fervour,
and John Mitchinson's stentorian tenor usually survived, while the textures
generally gave the mezzo (Ameral Gunson) and bass (Stephen Richardson) an
easier ride.
The orchestra had begun with Schoenberg's Variations for Orchestra Op. 31.
Rattle steered a lucid course through its structural intricacies, making
perfect, elegant sense of the variations themselves and bringing a real
sense of mounting drama to the finale, as one development section collapses
in on the next. Every particle of the instrumental playing was alive, sharp
etched; it was just the gripping prelude, though, to an evening that was
outstanding in every respect.
Royal Festival Hall; final London concerts tomorrow and Thursday

FT  29 MAR 93 / Arts: Blood Wedding - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Blood Wedding (1933) is the earliest of the 'Spanish Earth' trilogy by
Frederico Garcia Lorca (1898-1936), preceding Yerma (1934) and The House of
Bernarda Alba (1935). Its violence is wedded to a surrealism that connects
Lorca and his other work to the wider influences of 1920s Madrid and the
specific influences of his friends Salvador Dali and Luis Bunuel.
The Lyric Hammersmith (with Odyssey Theatre) has now staged a fine, powerful
and unsettling production of the play by balancing its tragedy and
surrealism.
Lorca wrote Blood Wedding from a 1928 newspaper report of a Granadan bride
who eloped with her lover on the wedding night. Her family pursued them; the
groom and the lover killed each other. Behind the violence lie old family
vendettas, and above it surreal preternatural forces: blood, death, time.
Garcia Marquez used the same resonant themes in Chronicle of a Death
Foretold, set in a small Colombian pueblo.
The strength of the Odyssey Theatre's Blood Wedding comes from its
collaboration with Cumbre Flamenca. The music and dance fill out the
concentrated action on the large stage at the Lyric. The flamenco brings
mystery and intensity as well as authentic 'cante jondo' (deep song),
sadness and joy in a poised hand or a turned head. Ian Davies' fine guitar
accompaniment creates the atmosphere, conjuring a hot July in Granada from a
cold March in Hammersmith.
The play's surreal second part, where Death and the Moon preside over the
bride and her lover, is beautifully handled by Helen Turner's design and
Peter Mumford's lighting. The naturalistic hacienda interior of the opening
gives way to a vertiginous effect with columns of light and falling sand, as
if the stage itself was dropping away from gravity and reality towards the
strange benediction and coda.
Nigel Jamieson's direction lets each of Lorca's tense, unfinished scenes
engender the next, so the play develops rhythm and pace. The balance of a
Lorca scene can change quickly, so pared down is the writing. He wrote
strong parts for women, and the actors here respond well. Frances Tomelty
(substituting at short notice for Sofia Kalinska) as the groom's mother is a
stern, terse woman in a hard world, the crack in the strong voice with 'My
tears will come when I am alone.' Opposite her, Rosario Serrano as the
Mother-in-Law moves easily and expertly between song, dance and speech; and
Rosalind Bennett is a prim bride in black, a sexy lover, and a desperate
fugitive.
However, the patchy translation misses Lorca's visceral expression. 'Aren't
you happy with so many riches heaped upon you?' looks mannered alongside the
bleak picture of marriage elsewhere: 'A man, some children and a wall two
feet thick. Nothing more.'
Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith until April 17

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (11): A legacy and a challenge - Premier
Goh Chok Tong must work harder to assert his authority
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE end of last year, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, put
his political neck on the block.
Mr Goh resigned from parliament and stood in a by-election in his own
constituency.
There was no doubting that Mr Goh and his governing Peoples Action Party
(PAP) would win. The crucial factor was the margin of victory. In the event
Mr Goh and the PAP gained 72 per cent of the vote.
Such is the nature of Singapore politics. If Mr Goh and the PAP had not
achieved a resounding victory in the by-election the prime minister's future
could have been in doubt.
Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's prime minister for nearly 30 years till he
handed over power to Mr Goh in 1990, told voters that the future of
Singapore would be in jeopardy if Mr Goh and the PAP did not win by a big
margin.
'There is a danger that a significant percentage of voters may believe they
can score points against the government by reducing the PM's votes and leave
their neighbours to vote for the PAP,' said Mr Lee.
'I ask them to pause and to consider the effect on their own future ..If the
by-election result is poor, you will cast a shadow on the PM's authority and
put Singapore and your own future in doubt ..If you deny the prime minister
a strong endorsement by a much lower percentage of votes, then you would
have shot yourselves in the foot.'
The need for such overwhelming victories at the polls is partly to do with
the problems Mr Goh has faced coming to office after such a dominant leader
as Mr Lee. It is also a reflection of the PAP's political culture.
Mr Goh has not had an easy time asserting his political authority. Mr Lee
towered over Singapore's politics and virtually every facet of the country's
life for more than 30 years. Mr Lee resigned from office to make way for a
second generation of leaders in Singapore, among them Mr Goh.
But Mr Lee did not leave the political stage. Far from it. He became senior
minister in Mr Goh's cabinet. Mr Lee did not hesitate to criticise if he
felt the running of the country was not being carried out properly.
In an effort to establish his own political mandate, Mr Goh called a general
election in mid 1991. The PAP won 77 of the 81 seats in parliament and 61
per cent of the popular vote.
The result, though highly respectable by the standards of most governing
parties elsewhere, was considered a serious setback by the PAP and by Mr
Goh. More opposition MPs than before had been allowed into parliament. The
PAP had seen its vote slip to its lowest level since the late 1960s.
Mr Goh did not feel his political legitimacy had been established. That
finally came with the by-election last December.
But in the interim, various factors had strengthened Mr Goh's position.
There is a widely held belief in Singapore that Mr Goh was not Mr Lee's
preferred choice as prime minister. Mr Lee had carefully groomed his own son
for the job.
Lee Hsien Loong, a reserve brigadier-general known as 'BG' Lee, is cut very
much in the same no-nonsense mould as his father. Mr Goh was seen only as an
interim prime minister - in the job until BG Lee, 40, was thought ready to
assume office.
BG Lee had distinguished himself as Minister for Trade and Industry and as
one of Singapore's two deputy prime ministers. But last November it was
announced that both BG Lee and Ong Teng Cheong, another deputy prime
minister, had cancer.
BG Lee has been away from the political scene for several months. Mr Goh
says that the younger Lee has responded well to treatment and it is likely
he will take up his duties again soon.
Mr Goh has taken over the important post of PAP secretary general from the
elder Mr Lee and put his own people in key positions, including placing a
former aide as head of the powerful internal security service.
Mr Goh appears confident and denies any suggestion that he is an interim
prime minister, or of any conflict with Mr Lee. 'The important thing is the
relationship between myself, the senior minister, BG Lee and my colleagues.
We know the nature of our relationships. I know what role I'll be playing in
Singapore ..I was hoping, frankly speaking, that I could contemplate my
retirement in the year 2000 ..I see myself in this job for quite some time
to come, even had there been nothing wrong with D-PM Lee.'
But Mr Goh and the PAP do have problems. If the PAP vote continues its
downward trend in general elections it is not inconceivable that within a
few years there could be up to 20 opposition MPs. There are those who see
this as an inevitable development in a maturing political and economic
environment.
The governing party is a highly disciplined, secretive organisation that
carefully selects its members. After more than 30 years in power the PAP and
government have become synonymous. The party still very much reflects Mr
Lee's image.
Mr Raj Vasil, a writer on Singapore politics, says the elder Lee is the
party in the eyes of Singaporeans: 'The PAP does not have much of an
identity independent of the (then) prime minister and the government headed
by him. Its image, identity and appeal are almost entirely derived from the
personality of the prime minister ..'
So far, there is little sign that the PAP is willing to countenance more
opposition or wishes to change its image.
A sizeable section of the Singapore population seems to feel that its
economic needs are being largely ignored by a government and party which is
seen to have grown elitist, too focused on the increasingly affluent,
English educated middle class.
This group feels life is becoming increasingly expensive. It feels it is
missing out on the fruits of Singapore's economic success. Many of these
people - Chinese dialect speakers living in housing estates - were once the
bedrock of PAP support.
Opposition parties are still small and tend to lack coherent alternative
policies. In the past government has used various methods to undermine the
opposition. Many talented Singaporeans have been reluctant to oppose
government.
But the PAP itself is also short of talent - a fact acknowledged by Mr Goh
late last year when he said his cabinet was ageing and needed to be
revitalised with new political talent.
'My job is to make sure that the drop in the PAP vote doesn't come about. So
when there is a one per cent drop, I get worried ..if the PAP can succeed in
recruiting very able people, honest, dedicated, committed, to join the
party, we think the PAP is going to be in government for a long, long time.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (12): Widening the island's mental
horizons - Profile: Role of the SIF
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE thing Singapore cannot be faulted for is planning. Long before the
government announced its policy to develop a fully fledged external economy
and encourage Singaporeans to invest overseas, the ground was being
prepared.
The Singapore International Foundation (SIF) was founded in 1991 with the
specific goal of encouraging Singaporeans to think internationally.
Dr Chan Heng Chee, former university lecturer and most recently Singapore
ambassador to the UN, is SIF's director. Though government played a role in
bringing the SIF into being, Dr Chan stresses that the SIF is an
independent, non political organisation.
'We aim to help Singapore in its efforts to go global. This should benefit
others and benefit Singapore as well.
'We have organised voluntary service schemes and now have Singaporean
professionals helping in various countries. At the same time we try to stay
in contact with Singaporeans overseas, to tell them about developments
here.'
Dr Chan feels much has changed in Singapore - not just the physical
landscape.
'Singapore has opened up. If you read the newspapers today compared with a
few years ago they are very different. There is more willingness to
criticise.
'The arts and theatre scene has changed. It might have a certain innocence
and perhaps it lacks sophistication. But I tell people there are tremendous
opportunities in Singapore, especially for the young.'
The SIF estimates that up to 100,000 Singaporeans are now living abroad, a
sizeable proportion of Singapore's 2.8m population. Dr Chan says that there
is concern about a brain drain and one of the aims of the SIF is to keep in
touch with Singapore's overseas talent. She denies any suggestion that her
organisation is out to keep tabs on its citizens.
'I don't have lists of names or dossiers - there is no Big Brother motive.'
Dr Chan feels Singapore has a lot to offer the world. 'Singapore is a good
brand name. We work hard, we are efficient, we get jobs.'
The SIF seeks to help Singaporeans to internationalise, while maintaining
what's considered to be a distinct Singaporean identity.
According to Dr Chan that identity is made up of various elements.
Insecurity is one of them. 'Insecurity is part of the psyche of Singapore.
Our history has taught us that we are vulnerable. We are a paradox. We
always have to balance the needs of creativity with the requirements of
building a state, a nation.'
But as more and more Singaporeans seek opportunities overseas, they will
have to loosen up. 'That will be a challenge to our identity.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (11): Lines are blurring -
A look at the markets in Latin debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATURE of the Latin American debt market is changing rapidly, as an
increasingly broad range of investors enters the market.
As this process advances, there has been a blurring of the strict
delineation between Latin American country loans traded in the secondary
market and new issues launched in the Eurobond market by both sovereign and
corporate Latin American borrowers.
In the wake of the debt crisis, when many Latin American countries defaulted
on their bank loans, the secondary market in their debt grew up as a result
of trading by banks, largely creditor banks trying to lay off or manage
their risk.
When Latin American sovereign and corporate borrowers returned to the
Eurobond market a few years ago, these high-yielding bonds were initially
bought largely by retail investors in Europe or by Latin American nationals
(in the form of so-called flight capital).
But the region's recent record of strong growth and economic reforms has
attracted new investors and a growing number of specialist funds. In fact,
the market in secondary bank loans has now been virtually replaced by a
market in Brady bonds, the restructured bank debt created under the Brady
debt reduction plan.
Venezuela and Mexico have already implemented their Brady plans, and
Argentina is poised to issue its Brady bonds.
Meanwhile, trading in Brazilian debt has stopped, ahead of the
implementation of the Brady package there, which was agreed with Brazil's
bank advisory committee last July, but has been disappointingly slow to come
to fruition.
The conclusion of the package has been delayed by the need to get an
International Monetary Fund agreement in place prior to the Brady plan. The
IMF agreement in turn requires a new package of measures by the government
which have, in turn, been delayed by political problems.
Meanwhile, trading in Brazilian bank debt has come to a standstill, because
banks have already tendered for bonds under the Brady plan. Instead, trading
is concentrated in IDU bonds (issued last year in lieu of interest payments)
and in when-and-if-issued (WIFI) Brady bonds. Among other Brady bonds,
Mexican par bonds have performed well, holding their spread relative to the
US Treasury market until recently, despite the strong US market rally.
However, the market in Venezuelan par and conversion bonds has been much
more difficult - 'there is a permanent political crisis: as a result, the
fiscal deficit and current account deficits are mounting,' says Mr Paul
Luke, head of developing country research at Morgan Grenfell.
The price of the par bonds slumped a point to 56 3/4 in a week, despite the
strong rally in the US market.
Meanwhile, the spread of investors in Latin American Eurobonds continues to
increase, with even mainstream institutional investors beginning to dip
their toes into the market, by buying Latin American securities as a small
part of large and diversified portfolios.
AN appetite for extra yield, at a time when low interest rates are squeezing
returns, has encouraged more investors to look at Latin American bonds.
Although the market has been volatile, there has been, overall, a steady
tightening of yield spreads relative to the US Treasury market in recent
years, as the creditworthiness of Latin American borrowers has improved.
But the market suffered a setback at the end of last year, when oversupply
caused yield margins to widen substantially. However, those wider margins,
reviewed at the start of the year, started to attract investors back to the
market.
As well as the broader range of investors, smaller Latin American countries
are now returning to the market. Also, the market is now open to more Latin
American companies, though investors remain nervous of weaker credits.
Colombia, which has never rescheduled its debt, will make its debut in early
April, via Bankers Trust, with a Dollars 100m issue of five or seven-year
Eurobonds, which is expected to attract strong demand.
Meanwhile, Uruguay, which completed its first Eurobond last year, is to
return to the market with a five-year deal, arranged by Chase Investment
Bank. Some bankers believe that Peru - or a government-owned company - may
also tap the market this year, after having implemented a number of economic
reforms last year. Ecuador is also cited as a potential new borrower.
However, bankers have become increasingly frustrated in their efforts to
bring Chilean borrowers to the market. The government has clamped down on
foreign borrowing, barring banks from tapping the market and restricting all
but a few companies.
'Every time you get a mandate, the Chilean authorities change the rules - in
effect, blocking the market,' complains one banker.
Chile has an active domestic market, where funding of up to 20 years is
available, but the amounts are small. In addition, banks are keen to raise
dollars in the international market to on-lend to companies for their export
business.
Borrowers are also beginning to tap markets other than the dollar market.
Venezuela is said to be planning a DM350-400m issue of five-year bonds via
Commerzbank (having just issued three-year dollar bonds in the domestic
Colombian market), and Pemex, the Mexican oil company, recently tapped the
Swiss franc bond market, for example.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (12): Tough testing ground
for reform - Richard Lapper shows how pension funds can help promote local
capital markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE IMMINENT prospect of a far-reaching reform of Argentine pensions law is
making life easier for Mr James Riley and Mr John Williams, who both work
with UK-based merchant bank, Kleinwort Benson.
The two men have spent the last six months advising the Argentine government
on the privatisation of the state-owned bank and insurance company, the Caja
Nacional de Ahorro y Seguro.
The pension fund reform will lead to the rapid development of the private
pensions and life insurance market, boosting both local and overseas
interest in the Caja, which will expect to have a sizeable slice of the
action.
That should improve the price the Argentine government should get for the
sale - estimated by Mr Williams at between Dollars 60m and Dollars 100m -
and provide a useful boost to the Latin American activities of Kleinwort and
Coopers and Lybrand, the accountancy and management firm that is also
involved.
'One of the key selling points of the Caja is its ability take advantage of
the reform. It should help all round,' says Mr Williams, who expects the
privatisation to go ahead in the Spring.
But much broader interests hinges on the successful approval and
implementation of a private funded pensions system in Argentina. At a time
when virtually every Latin American government is considering the
replacement of increasingly unwieldy 'save-as-you-go' pensions schemes - in
which pensions are paid out of current taxation and social security revenues
 -success in Argentina would be a huge fillip for the continent's pensions
embryonic industry.
Local and foreign investors have been encouraged by the progress in Chile,
where the pension system was privatised in 1981.
The more complex economic, social and political context offered by Argentina
is likely to be a tougher testing ground for the idea that the development
of private pension funds can contribute towards the successful modernisation
and liberalisation of the continent's economies.
The success of Chile's pension fund reform has been hugely influential among
the continent's politicians and businessmen. Chile replaced its
pay-as-you-go system in 1981, with a law that obliged workers to contribute
10 per cent of their wages to private funds. Already over a dozen pension
fund administration companies or administradores de fondos de pensiones
(AFPs) have built up Dollars 12.5bn in funds.
These developments have been among a number designed to strengthen the local
private sector.
The Santiago stock market, boosted by new issues stemming from an ambitious
privatisation programme, has been given stability by the AFPs, who can
invest up to 30 per cent of their assets in stocks, and have begun to
function as institutional investors, owning about 10 per cent of the
market's Dollars 30bn capitalisation.
The AFPs are also at the centre of the development of the only long-term
debt market in Latin America. In 1989, Chile developed strong enough credit
ratings to be able to sell bonds to the AFPs. Since then they have sold more
than Dollars 5bn in bonds with maturities up to 27 years.
Last year Chile's AFPs enjoyed a 48 per cent return on their assets,
tempting three European groups Banco Santander of Spain, Union des
Assurances de Paris and Les Mutuelles du Mans Assurance of France to invest
in the sector alongside US groups such as Bankers Trust, Aetna and American
Insurance Group.
Talk of the Chilean experience dominated a recent conference on pension fund
reform in San Diego, California. Mr Rudolf van der Bijl, an official with
the International Finance Corporation, a World Bank subsidiary which
promotes private sector development, told the conference: 'The demand for
marketable securities generated by the accumulation of long-term savings in
the hands of funded pension plans can provide a strong boost to emerging
markets.'
Mexico, Peru and Argentina are presently drafting legislation to replace or
complement their state systems with private retirement schemes other
countries may soon follow suit.
Mexico has set up a new system that will co-exist with its existing social
security system. The Argentine system will differ in some respects - banks
and insurance companies will be allowed to own pension fund companies for
example - and the government-owned Banco de la Nacion will compete with
privately owned pension fund managers with its own facility.
But, in other respects, Argentina's model mirrors developments on the other
side of the Andes. Argentine workers are likely to be forced to contribute
11 per cent of their salaries to pension funds of their choice. The stakes
are high. If successful, Argentine pension fund managers could be managing
Dollars 3.5bn within a year and up to Dollars 40bn within a decade,
providing a valuable source of capital for the local stock market.
However, the transition could well be painful, partially because Argentina's
social security is both more developed and under much more strain than those
of its neighbours. The number of pensioners has roughly doubled compared to
the number of workers making contributions. Employers contributions have
been increased in response - 40 per cent of payroll is paid in social
security taxes.
Even so, heavy arrears amounting to some Dollars 10bn have been accumulated
and benefits have declined in real terms, leaving thousands of pensioners on
incomes well below the official poverty level. Local newspapers have
reported public suicides by distressed pensioners.
Advisers believe that the establishment of a fully funded scheme is the only
way the problem can be tackled - 'it is an absolutely crucial step to make,'
says Mr Riley. But the transition period will not be easy: he expects the
move towards a new system will worsen problems in the short term, as new
contributions are funnelled into investment funds rather than towards
existing pensioners.
'In Chile, the system was introduced by an autocratic regime. The trick is
to see whether it can be done in a democracy. It will be a real test in
Argentina.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (10): Dynamic engine with a military
rhythm - Singapore Technologies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE heart of Singapore's intensely competitive, market-orientated economy
is a group of state companies, accounting for an estimated 25 per cent of
gdp. They, along with the multinational corporations, have formed the engine
of Singapore's economic growth over the years.
Singapore Technologies Industrial Corp. (STIC) is part of the Singapore
Technologies conglomerate, the largest industrial and high technology group
in the country with a total workforce of more than 12,000 and annual sales
of Dollars 1bn.
The Singapore Technologies group started life in the mid 1960s as the
industrial arm of Singapore's armed forces. One company in the group,
Chartered Industries, has developed considerable expertise in a wide range
of armaments and, according to a Singapore newspaper report last year, is
now one of the world's top 10 military small-arms companies.
The group has diversified into many other areas. Following a company
reorganisation in the late 1980s, STIC was formed to oversee the group's
commercial activities in the electronics, precision engineering and
industrial services sectors. Last year STIC had a turnover of SDollars 730m.
'Start with the idea that Singapore is like a company - that's the way it
works,' says Mr K. S. Wong, STIC's president.
Mr Wong says STIC is not like public companies in other countries. 'We have
no subsidies. We have to borrow from the market. We have to take part in
tender processes and compete with private sector companies.'
STIC's activities are very varied. It owns the largest computer software
house in southeast Asia and provides computer recovery services to a number
of companies, including Singapore Airlines.
It provides communications links on Singapore's mass rapid transport system
(MRT), runs car parks, builds flight simulators, supplies the Singapore army
with cooked food, runs a vehicle leasing company, owns one of the country's
biggest travel companies and two retail stores. It also operates Singapore's
mint and mints coins for Burma and Brunei.
Now the emphasis is on expanding activities overseas. Industrial park
development has been the main focus of attention. STIC helped in the
formation of the first industrial park in Thailand a few years ago.
In partnership with another state company - Jurong Environmental Engineering
 -and the Indonesian Salim Group, STIC is building and operating a 500
hectare industrial park on the Indonesian island of Batam, about 20km south
of Singapore.
Batam will eventually employ 20,000 workers, mainly in the electronics
industry. Already several multinational companies have set up operations on
the island.
'We provide everything for the (multinationals) from beginning to end,' says
Mr Wong.
'We organise work permits, build their factories, lay on water and
electricity, build sewerage systems, provide their housing. All they have to
do is get on with their business.'
The Batam concept is now being transferred to China on a much larger scale.
With the same partners STIC is building a 5,000 hectare industrial park in
Fujian province. A similar project is being investigated in southern India.
Other international opportunities are being explored. STIC now has offices
in Munich, New York and Tokyo. As well as industrial parks STIC is involved
in specialised electronics and precision engineering projects overseas. STIC
has recently entered into an agreement to supply stitcher/binder modules for
Xerox photocopiers.
Mr Wong says there are many other possibilities for STIC overseas,
particularly if partnerships are formed with multinationals.
'If you are a multinational in Europe or elsewhere, involved in technology
and want to come to Asia then we suggest you look at us as a possible
partner. STIC has an established network in the regional market. We also
have all important guanxi (connections) in China. Perhaps most importantly
we are willing to put our money up front. Forming such partnerships is part
of our philosophy and the way to grow internationally in the future.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (9): Challenge of the eastern horizons -
Asia's industrial expansion is a magnet for Singapore investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE last year Mr Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore's senior minister, made a lengthy
visit to China. The trip acted as the catalyst for what is being billed as
one of the main policy shifts in Singapore in recent years.
Mr Lee returned to berate Singaporeans for not participating in China's
economic progress. Singapore had been made too comfortable said Mr Lee. The
country was in danger of missing out because its people were not willing to
take risks and invest overseas.
'That's our problem . . . no one wants to go abroad . . . we have got to
shake Singaporeans up, make them adventurous, or we will be losers.'
All the considerable armoury of the government has since been mobilised to
promote a new more outward looking policy. Ministers constantly talk of the
need for Singapore to develop an external economy, a 'second pillar' or
wing.
They say Singapore must be more willing to take advantage of economic
developments in the region. Singaporeans themselves must become more
entrepreneurial, more willing to take risks, less afraid of failure. 'Who
Dares, Wins' should in future be Singapore's motto, says Mr Lee.
The basic idea behind the new policy is that Singapore, having outgrown its
small domestic base, cannot continue to expand its economy without the boost
of external investments.
Entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Taiwan and conglomerates from South Korea
have all made huge investments overseas which will provide added growth at
home in the years to come.
Singapore, says the government, has lagged seriously behind and now has to
become more outward looking. The alternative, says Mr Lee, is an unpleasant
one. 'We will be a failed story - one that nearly made it but stalled half
way.'
The Singapore Inc appoach, used so successfully at home, is being duplicated
overseas, with government departments and bureaucracy coordinating with big
business to mount a foreign campaign.
Dr Richard Hu, the Finance Minister, announced a number of incentives to
promote outward investments in his recent budget. The main thrust of a new
tax package, which involved cuts in both personal and corporate tax rates,
was to encourage investments abroad.
Tax exemptions are to be given to various overseas ventures, while the
government will provide cash incentives to operations setting up abroad.
'Individuals will be encouraged to take part in risky but highly profitable
ventures, knowing that if they dare and succeed, government will not cream
off a large share of their rewards,' said Dr Hu.
Singapore trade offices abroad are helping investors identify opportunities.
The government's Economic Development Board (EDB), which has attracted
hundreds of companies to invest in Singapore, is now helping fund
Singaporean businesses which want to open shop overseas.
A number of Singapore schools are planned overseas to encourage families to
live abroad. The government has even set up a special committee to ponder
the difficult question of how to make Singaporeans more entrepreneurial.
Some are sceptical about the new policy. They point out that the government
itself, and Mr Lee in particular, have been in many ways responsible for
fostering attitudes now being criticised.
They argue that by building up an over-regulated, carefully controlled
society with an economy dominated by state companies, the entrepreneur has
been squeezed out of people.
Others say the real aim of the new policy is to tweak the ears of
Singaporeans and prevent complacency. 'The government is once again using
scare tactics, telling us that unless we try harder we are in serious
trouble,' says one critic. 'It's a very familiar refrain.'
In fact, Singapore already has considerable investments overseas. A recently
completed Department of Statistics report said 2,290 Singapore-based
companies had set up subsidiaries abroad up to the end of 1990, with direct
investments totalling SDollars 7.49bn. Malaysia and Hong Kong were the two
top locations both in terms of company numbers and amounts invested.
The report concluded that Singapore's direct investments overseas are
'expected to grow dramatically in the 1990s' as new markets open up and
Singaporean businesspeople gain more experience of working abroad.
That prediction has already been borne out by developments in China and
Vietnam. China says that Singapore investments in China in the first six
months of 1992 totalled USDollars 494m against a total of USDollars 896m for
the entire 1979-91 period.
Hardly a day passes without the announcement of another big China project,
usually involving one or other of Singapore's public companies in
combination with private sector partners (see article below on Singapore
Technologies).
In particular, Singapore is selling its expertise in infrastructural
development and management - covering everything from airports and airlines
to banking and fiscal systems - in the China market.
The same is the case in Vietnam. Singapore is now not only Vietnam's biggest
trading partner, it is also among the leading investors in the country.
For several years Singapore-based companies have been investing in hotels
and real estate, most visibly in Australia but also more recently in England
and elsewhere. Several Singapore hoteliers are now investing in new projects
in China and Vietnam.
Singapore is sitting on a mountain of savings. Its foreign exchange reserves
are officially put at Dollars 40bn though they are generally considered to
be considerably higher.
The government's Singapore Investment Corp (GSIC) which acts as government
fund manager, has substantial funds invested in stocks overseas. The GSIC is
reported to have navigated recent ups and downs on the Tokyo and Wall Street
stock markets exceptionally well. 'They are the smartest guys in town,' said
one merchant banker.
But some government investments have not gone well. A 1991 purchase for
SDollars 821m of a 30 per cent stake in Mount Charlotte Investments, a
British-based hotel chain, has not so far provided any returns. Other
investments in high tech companies in California's Silicon valley have also
proved less than attractive.
The government's answer to its critics is that such investments are made
long term and that once risks are taken, then some degree of failure is
likely.
The government now feels it is vital that such attitudes are passed on to
the private sector. Entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and Taiwan are not worried
about the prospect of failure. As Mr Lee notes, every Hongkonger believes
that he can become a millionaire.
'There is that spirit of adventure, that willingness to take risks, to lose
everything and to try again, that makes them so different and so successful.
On the other hand, Singaporeans prefer secure careers and are home-bound.
They are not willing to give up the security of Singapore for more gain
abroad when they think the risks are too high or where it entails much
discomfort.'
Inculcating a more cavalier, swashbuckling approach in Singapore
businesspeople has its dangers. Singapore prides itself on its above board
business style. Entrepreneurs, to be successful overseas, might have to
learn to be more tricky.
Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, was recently asked if he felt
there was a danger that Singaporeans might import less savoury business
habits from overseas.
'I think when they go outside, they have to learn how to succeed and our
rules will be very clear.
'In Singapore we do things in our usual way . . . Outside I think they'll
have to be entrepreneurial. Inside they will have to be correct.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (10): A positive but highly
uncertain outlook - In conclusion . . .
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN AMERICA'S new capital inflows have undoubtedly to be seen in part in
the context of important changes in capital movements at a global level -
the growing integration of capital markets across borders, institutions and
financial market sectors. Traditional markets have matured. Businesses have
become international in perspective, looking beyond their national borders
for new products, customers and inputs. Improved transport and
communications have facilitated this as has technological change and
innovation.
Such changes suggest that, provided an open world trading system remains in
place, long-term external structural reasons exist for continued flows of
capital to Latin America.
Much still depends on a continuation of the developments in the region in
the last five years: in particular, the better economic management and
greater political stability. This will in turn hang on the results of the
coming round of presidential elections in Latin America.
In some countries, these elections will be taking place in a transitional
period: the initial glow from renewed capital inflows will have worn off,
the shrinking of industry brought about by economic and trade reform will
start to bite and the longer-term benefits of investment will have yet to
become apparent.
Indeed, economic forecasts suggest slower growth for 1993. Widening trade
deficits seem set to act as a drag on economies, as will interest rates set
higher either to support a weak currency or to tackle high wage demands.
There will thus be the temptation to abandon the fight against inflation in
a bid to restart growth. The World Bank points out that in a global
marketplace there is a sharply-reduced tolerance for poor policies; yet this
does not mean that governments will not try them.
In part, longer-term prospects will be determined by how investors fare in
Latin America in these transitional years. They also depend on investor
behaviour in a US economic recovery and as US interest rates start to rise.
According to the International Monetary Fund, in a study published this
month: 'Swings in private capital outflows from the United States play a key
role as external impulses that affect the size of capital inflows into Latin
America.' Furthermore, despite the Brady settlements, some governments
remain vulnerable to interest rate increases on their foreign debt.
Foreign capital has been likened to an umbrella that opens in the sunshine
and closes in the storm: it flows abundantly only when least needed. This
underlines the importance of efforts under way to enhance domestic savings
to reduce the reliance on foreign capital. For example, the pension fund
reforms proposed in Argentina might add 2-3 percentage points to the
domestic savings rate. However, increasing domestic savings is not something
that can be achieved overnight and dependence on external savings seems
likely to continue in most countries for some time. And even though there
are many reasons why substantial capital inflows should continue through the
1990s, that is not to say that these will occur. There may well be
significant year-to-year volatility in capital flows, and therein lies the
rub.
If there is confidence in economic policy, then inflows may well be
sustained. But if for whatever reason - perhaps something external to the
economy - inflows slow dramatically, then confidence in economic policy
could ebb, inducing further capital outflows. The chances of a collapse in
confidence are greater when the exchange rate is seen as overvalued, a risk
now being run both in Mexico and Argentina.
Latin American governments can play their part in reducing volatility by
making sure their economic policy 'fundamentals' are strong. But they are
not masters of their own destinies, by any means.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (6): Island of integrity - The financial
centre has an enviable reputation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR foreign bankers, brokers or fund managers, life in Singapore can be
frustrating.
They see the local economy continuing to grow at a cracking pace, and
grumble about the relative lack of opportunities to invest in it.
They covet the huge pool of official reserves and other funds under the
government's control, knowing that there is little chance for outsiders to
profit from helping to manage them, and envy Singapore's own cash-rich but
highly conservative banks. And they chafe under the rule of the country's
monetary authority, whose regulatory regime must outrank in severity that in
any other of the world's money centres.
Some gaze wistfully towards Hong Kong, and moan at Singapore's apparent
failure to make the most of opportunities in its own hinterland.
Their gripes are understandable but exaggerated. Finanzplatz Singapore may
be a lot less exciting than its free-wheeling rival to the north. But with
characteristic deliberation and single-mindedness it has carved for itself
an important niche in handling the exploding flows of money around the
region. Moreover, its reputation for boring integrity as opposed to
speculative excess means it is in no danger of losing that niche, and may be
well-placed to build on it - the more so if Hong Kong takes fright with the
approach of the handback to China in 1997.
As far as the banking sector is concerned, the numbers speak for themselves.
Singapore is currently home or host to 135 banks, all but 13 of them
foreign. Most are highly profitable: according to the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS), total profits for foreign banks in the country remained
buoyant last year after a 36 per cent rise in 1990 and 41 per cent growth,
to SDollars 1.84 bn, in 1991. Local banks' profits were also continuing to
grow at a steady clip of 12-plus per cent. At a time when financial
institutions in many parts of the world are struggling simply to stay in the
black, Singapore must be doing something right.
The activity increasingly at the heart of international banks' operations in
the city state is foreign exchange trading. Figures from the Bank for
International Settlements show that Singapore is now the world's fourth
biggest forex trading centre, with an average daily trading volume of
USDollars 74bn last year - still a long way behind London, New York and
Tokyo but for the first time ahead of Zurich.
Signs are that this growth will continue. More and more banks are making
Singapore, with its world-class infrastructure and telecommunications, the
centre for their Asian currency and interest rate business, trading a
widening range of financial instruments: the biggest local forex operator,
Union Bank of Switzerland, has expanded into a full-scale treasury operation
and others are following.
The authorities hope that the presence of so many integrated trading rooms
in Singapore will act as an additional lure for multinational companies
pondering whether to use the island as their Asia headquarters. They are
also discreetly wooing other regional central banks. Brunei already manages
its sizeable official reserves through Singapore, and the Bank of China is
said to be on the point of establishing a branch there.
The particular advantage of Singapore as a forex centre, say MAS officials,
is its international character. Unlike Tokyo, which is dominated by
dollar-yen trading, business in Singapore is spread more evenly between
dollar-yen, dollar-D-mark and other trades, and smaller regional currencies
are also playing a growing role. 'We have a much more diversified market
with more depth and breadth than Tokyo,' said one official. 'Banks find it
convenient to come here because you can trade a whole range of currencies.'
Another increasingly important string to Singapore's trading bow is Simex,
the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, which after years spent on
the margins of the financial futures business now claims to be the fastest
growing futures market in the world. Total turnover roughly doubled last
year to 12m lots as Simex grabbed an increasing share of trading in
contracts based on Tokyo's Nikkei stock index and Euroyen interest rates.
The exchange plans to build on this success with the imminent launch of a
Hong Kong stock index contract, and by expanding links with growing centres
such as Taipei, with a view to becoming Asia's financial futures capital.
Singapore-based banks are benefiting in part from the difficulties being
experienced in many other financial centres around the world. Although the
interbank Asian dollar market is scarcely growing at present, and has
actually shrunk from its peak in 1990, it has become significantly more
profitable. Competition from Japanese banks, in particular, has become less
intense as they struggle to comply with BIS capital ratios; as a result,
interest margins have improved.
Similarly healthy profits are being recorded in the domestic credit market:
domestic loans and advances rose by 8 per cent in 1992 as banks cashed in on
the local construction boomlet and the general pickup in economic growth
towards the end of the year. Singapore-based banks are grabbing an
increasing slice of lucrative regional loan syndication business, too, and
are major issuers of Asian dollar bonds.
It is when you consider the broader picture, however, that Singapore's
current limitations as a financial centre begin to become clear. Active
currency and futures businesses are useful tools for a country seeking to
maintain and enhance its entrepot status. But they do not quite constitute a
capital market with real depth and diversity; nor, given the vast resources
at its disposal, do they measure up to Singapore's true potential as a
financial power.
Indeed, there are a number of specific domains in which foreign bankers and
brokers argue that Singapore risks being overshadowed by regional rivals in
the next few years. The stock market is one. The Singapore Stock Exchange,
once the leading market in South-east Asia, has long been dwarfed by its
counterparts in Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur - now in competition with Singapore
although some Malaysian stocks are still listed there.
Buying shares in an economy growing at 6 per cent or more a year should be
an enticing prospect, and did entice seven foreign brokers to take seats on
the exchange two years ago. But the buying opportunities are sparse. With
much of the economy under the control of the government or of multinational
investors, only a narrow range of Singaporean companies is listed.
In all but a tiny number of stocks, trading is thin and illiquid, overall
volume is not rising, and price/earnings ratios compare unfavourably with
those on offer elsewhere in the region - albeit in markets where the risks
are much higher. Brokers complain of onerous tax arrangements, and of
cumbersome and intrusive market regulation. As a result, Singapore has had
fewer new companies seeking listings than some of its peers, and the market
has been slow to develop.
'Five years ago as a foreign investor you had a choice of Tokyo, Hong Kong
and Singapore/Malaysia,' said one broker. 'Now there's a lot of choices.
Thailand is a much bigger market. You don't have to be here if you don't
want to be.'
Some relief may be at hand, however, in the form of long-awaited
privatisations. Later this year, the government plans to float a stake -
probably 25 per cent, with a tranche offered to foreign investors - in
Singapore Telecom, its highly profitable telephone monopoly. The
multi-billion dollar issue, which is expected to be heavily subscribed, will
immediately add volume and breadth to the market. It is also being seen as
the harbinger of further partial privatisations - notably involving the port
authority and other utilities. The authorities are also anxious to develop
stock options and other derivatives on the exchange, which may further
enliven proceedings in due course.
Singapore's banks, too, face a daunting regional challenge. By tradition
they are staid, unadventurous institutions, preferring to focus their
attention on the domestic market rather than expanding aggressively into the
riskier world outside. Their rewards have been strong and reliable profits
and a capital base that most international banks can only dream of (most
have capital ratios well in excess of the ultra-conservative 12 per cent
standard set by the MAS).
The authorities - proud of a record untainted by bank failures or scandals -
have long encouraged the banks in their caution, both through their 'safety
first' approach to regulation and through their restrictions on the
international use of the Singapore dollar. Now, however, they are exhorting
the banks, like other Singaporean companies, to work harder on building a
regional presence, which means building overseas branch networks and deposit
bases.
It is far from clear that the bosses of the big four banks are equipped, by
temperament or experience, for the task - although some local bankers and
financiers are already dipping a toe in the water by establishing venture
capital funds for investment in other Asian countries. Mr Lee Kuan Yew,
Singapore's senior minister, has endorsed this trend, saying: 'Overseas
development funds are an important segment of our capital market which we
must develop.'
There is one other big impediment to the rapid development of Singapore as a
diversified regional capital market and fund management centre: the
government's restrictive approach to information, underlined last year by a
crackdown on journalists and brokers after the leaking to the Business Times
of an official estimate for growth.
The foreign financial community remains bewildered about this affair. But
perhaps the authorities - mindful of the dangers of loosening control - are
happy with the financial industry just as it is.

and plastics

THE modern image of Singapore is of an economy dominated by electronics and
other high tech products. But petroleum, one of Singapore's most established
industries, still forms a key element in the economy.
Those who once referred to petroleum in Singapore as a sunset industry have
been proved wrong. Last year more than SDollars 400m was spent on upgrading
and refurbishing existing refineries.
Singapore is the world's third biggest refining centre after Rotterdam and
Houston. The oil majors and the locally and foreign held Singapore Refining
Company have invested heavily in a range of sophisticated plant and
equipment.
The total capacity of Singapore's refineries is now slightly over 1m barrels
a day, supplying almost 40 per cent of Asia's refined product imports.
Singapore has also become - along with London and New York - one of the
world's main oil trading centres.
The petroleum sector accounts for more than 10 per cent of Singapore's total
manufacturing output and refined goods continue to be one of the largest
items in the country's trade account.
Low refining prices world-wide have squeezed local profit margins in recent
years. But Singapore's future as a refining centre would seem to be assured
by a number of factors:
Singapore's geographical position, at the centre of the supply chain from
the Middle East to Asia's main markets in Japan and South Korea, is becoming
ever more important as most economies in the Asia region rapidly expand.
Oil demand in the Asia region is now rising by nearly four per cent a year
compared with a world average of 0.5 per cent. Total petroleum demand in the
Asia Pacific region is projected to rise from the present 14.5m b/d to
nearly 20m b/d by the turn of the century.
To meet this fast expanding regional demand, increasing amounts of oil will
have to be shipped from the Middle East - through Singapore. Though
exploration activities are being stepped up in Asia, only about 44 per cent
of the region's oil needs are locally produced. By the turn of the century
it is estimated that nearly 80 per cent of Asia's oil will be imported.
Though several countries in the region have announced plans to build
refineries, there is concern about the increasing costs involved. Singapore
is fortunate to have an established refining industry: it is far cheaper to
expand and upgrade existing plants than build new ones.
As a consequence of upgrading programmes Singapore is now acknowledged as
one of the most efficient refining centres, capable of processing a wide
range of product. Particular emphasis has been put on investments in
equipment to produce low sulphur fuels, the so called 'green' products
increasingly in demand in the region.
A considerable petrochemical industry has grown up alongside the petroleum
sector. Overall nearly 300 foreign and local companies are involved in
refining, petrochemicals, industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals and advanced
materials.
As in the refining sector the petrochemical industry's margins have been
squeezed in recent years by generally low world prices, plus a rapid rise in
regional production, mainly caused by several plants coming on stream in
South Korea.
But Singapore's planners see a big growth in regional demand for
petrochemical products in the years ahead and have successfully attracted
some of the biggest names in the business to invest in new plants. As in all
areas of investment activity, Singapore is providing key infrastructural
support.
A landfill project is planned which will unite five islands off the main
island of Singapore into a SDollars 4bn petrochemical complex. Du Pont,
Mobil, GE Plastics and others are investing more than SDollars 2bn in a
variety of projects.
One of Du Pont's plants will produce key ingredients for polyurethane used,
among other things, for liners in the ever expanding running shoe industry.
Companies such as Nike moved their manufacturing operations to Asia some
years ago: of the 90m pairs of shoes Nike produces each year, less than two
per cent are made outside Asia.
In future Du Pont will be able to feed Nike plants in Indonesia and
elsewhere from its Singapore plant, rather than from the US.
'We've been selling our products in this region for many years,' says Mr
Thomas Springer, managing director of Du Pont's Singapore operations. 'Now
having a presence here makes sense both from a production and from a sales
point of view. Over the next few years we see our market in the Asia Pacific
growing at twice the rate of anywhere else.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (7): Every 4 minutes a ship comes in -
The world's largest port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANYONE sceptical about Singapore's confidence in long-range planning, and in
its ability to circumvent its own environmental and demographic limitations,
should visit the port, writes ANDREW GOWERS.
Occupying a pivotal site at the southern end of the Strait of Malacca, one
of the world's busiest shipping channels, it is now larger than any other in
terms of on-shore surface area and of the gross registered tonnage of ships
that call there.
With volume still growing at an annual rate of 15-17 per cent, it is
surpassed only by perennial rival Hong Kong in volume of container traffic,
and that only in the last year as the latter's China trade has soared. Work
on a new SDollars 1.4bn terminal in an island in mid-harbour to expand
capacity nearly 50 per cent by 1995 from the current level of around 9m TEUs
(twenty equivalent units - the standard container measure) is well advanced.
Sounds like enough to be going on with? Not for Singapore. The Port of
Singapore Authority (PSA) is already working on a plan to build almost three
times as much capacity again in four phases by the year 2030: a new 36m-TEU
container mega-terminal to be constructed mainly on reclaimed land next to
the existing port complex. It would be foolish to question its determination
to proceed on schedule, with the first few berths ready just as Hong Kong
reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
In any other part of the world, this might sound like tinpot gigantomania.
After all, many of Singapore's neighbours are engaged in their own elaborate
and expensive port building or upgrading schemes. Surely there cannot be
room for all of them and for another three Singapores?
PSA and government officials beg to differ. Experience has shown, says Mr
Lee Chee Yeng, the authority's director of operations, that Singapore stands
to benefit from increasing business elsewhere in the region, that it can
maintain and improve its service as a hub which other ports will feed with
cargo. 'It's not a zero sum game,' he adds.
This is already a well-established pattern for Singapore, destination for
huge numbers of feeder services from Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and as
far afield as Sri Lanka and southern India. As international container ships
have grown ever vaster - from perhaps 1,000 TEUs two decades ago to 6,000
TEUs today - the need for efficient hub ports that can swiftly transfer
containers from one vessel to another has grown.
'Ships are getting very big now and very expensive,' says Mr Lee. 'They want
to go to a few big ports and get out quickly. Big ports offer a wider choice
of lines and prices are more competitive.'
The volumes of traffic are staggering. A ship arrives in Singapore on
average every four minutes - about 80,000 a year. On any given day, around
60,000 20-foot or 40-foot containers are parked on the concrete waterfront
while lines of vessels wait their turn in the haze beyond. Officials reckon
that the port can turn around a ship carrying 1,000 boxes in 11 to 12 hours,
which they claim is the fastest turnaround time in the world.
In this the PSA - a profit-making body owned by the government but due for
partial privatisation, perhaps next year - is helped by Singapore's
fanatical approach to its own limitations, and its high technology.
The two things which ports use particularly intensively are the two things
in shortest supply on the island: land and labour. The PSA has thus had to
find inventive methods of processing, storing, shifting and loading
containers.
It is experimenting with driver-less trucks to move boxes around and a
computerised operating system which will plot precisely where they should
go; it is plugged into a fully computerised document processing system which
eliminates burdensome paperwork and completes customs procedures while the
cargo is still at sea; it is using expert computer systems to determine the
precise placing of containers within a cargo hold.
The only big snag, it seems, in this world of just-in-time planning, control
and automation is the ocean itself. Mr Lee confesses he has yet to come up
with a technological answer to the typhoons that regularly sweep the
south-east Asian seas.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (8): Voices of dissent
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMISTS, however, do not make foreign investment decisions. Producers do.
And some producers are sceptical that the course now adopted in the region -
the economic strategy praised so widely - will necessary yield the expected
investment.
The Latin American head of one multinational holds a view of economic
policies in Brazil and Argentina - two countries in which it has had
long-standing operations - which is diametrically opposed to the
conventional economic wisdoms.
He sees policy in Argentina, where his company is losing money, as
disastrously damaging the country's economic structure: low tariffs and a
high exchange rate have made imports cheap and forced him to cut prices.
Meanwhile, because domestic inflation is slow to come down, his domestic
costs structure is rising and his company is caught in a vice.
He describes Argentina as a wonderful place to export products to, but as an
awful place in which to establish a factory. On the other hand, he is
enthusiastic about Brazil, where his company is making significant profits
but which economists view almost as an economic disaster zone.
Another large multinational, this time from the US, is cited as planning to
invest heavily in Latin America - in one country: Brazil. This is because
Brazil is the biggest home market and can be used as a base for the rest of
Latin America. If the factories were to be established outside Brazil, the
company believes it would find it almost impossible to sell into the largest
domestic market.
Economists would argue that, while it is not unusual for producers to seek
to extract benefits from import substitution, the policies that producers
tend to favour tend to prop up inefficient industry. These policies have
harmed Latin America in the past.
Furthermore, the whole point of opening the economy is to create more
efficient industries where the country has a comparative advantage, and to
close down uncompetitive plant. Thus, under the North American Free Trade
Agreement between Canada, the US and Mexico, capital-intensive production
could be expected to concentrate in the US; and labour-intensive production
in Mexico, where it is cheaper.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (9): Influences on foreign
direct investors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EXTENT of future development of regional free trade areas will have a
significant impact on longer-term direct investment trends. Ratification of
Nafta - due this year to go before the legislatures of the three countries -
would provide an important pointer.
The huge direct investment into Europe in the 1980s ahead of the creation of
the single market strongly suggests that companies are driven to invest not
only by fears of future trade barriers but also by expectations of improved
growth opportunities.
According to the International Finance Corporation, the private sector arm
of the World Bank, market size is one of the most important considerations
in making investment location decisions, while prospects for market growth
are also particularly important. Larger 'home' markets mean bigger local
sales, which are usually more profitable than exports. Larger markets offer
more diverse resources to make local sourcing more feasible.
According to the IFC, relative costs continue to play an important role in
influencing decisions on the location of foreign direct investment. But some
factors are now less important, in part because direct labour costs in many
industries now account for only 10-15 per cent of manufacturing costs.
To encourage direct investment, many Latin American governments may be
tempted to offer subsidies. A more sensible response would be further
reforms, for example of the labour market. Social security and other systems
act in many countries as a payroll tax and sharply raise the costs of
employing labour while often providing marginal benefits to employees.
With the rising cost of white-collar workers, there is an important
attraction if countries offer a pool of well-educated labour. Many Latin
American economies are well-equipped to offer such labour, although there is
often insufficient skilled labour. There is thus a gap between the highly
educated and the unskilled workers, which can be filled only by improvements
in education systems that have deteriorated over the last decade.
A country's legal system is also critically important. For foreign investors
 -as well as for ordinary citizens - the legal systems of the region leave
much to be desired. Investors are conscious that while Latin America's
judicial processes may be more developed than those of east Europe, they are
still often arbitrary and prone to corruption. The dictum of the Mexican
president Benito Juarez still often applies: 'To my enemies the law; to my
friends everything.'
Perceived country risk also continues to be important to investors, but it
is obviously less so in some industries where, for example, returns are high
or where operations can be terminated rapidly without undue cost, such as
garment assembly. The advertised fast payback period is presumably why some
investors are willing to consider tourist developments in Cuba, where the
risk of political upheaval is hardly remote.
Potential investors also look at the level of existing foreign investment
for assurance and at the possibility of synergies developing as foreign
firms become one another's suppliers. Such a development is already in
evidence in the Mexican car industry.
The quality of infrastructure is an important determinant of the attraction
of foreign direct investment. This underlines again - as in education - the
importance of an appropriate public investment policy as an essential
element in the encouragement of private investment.
FDI prospects depend also on what is happening in a company's traditional
markets. Just as portfolio investors started looking at emerging markets
when returns at home dropped, so corporate investors have stretched out to
developing countries in an attempt to raise their returns on capital.
Some companies facing mature markets at home where they have to battle
expensively with competitors for fractions of a percentage point in market
share are increasingly looking for a foothold in fast-growing developing
country markets. One illustration of this mature market phenomenon suggests
it costs 10 times more to attract one new visitor to Disneyland than it did
a decade or so ago.
Typical of these companies are those in what are now called fast-moving
consumer goods. One such company is Nestle, which first entered Latin
America in 1876, selling to Brazil. It established its first sales office in
Rio de Janeiro in 1914, with a factory in 1921. Today it has 70 plants and
30,000 people in Latin America, providing 11 per cent of Nestle turnover.
The region's share of the volume of production is higher than that, however,
because controls have kept prices down.
Partly because of the general lifting of price controls, Nestle is positive
about the region. After a 'lost decade', the company's sales in Argentina
have trebled in a year. It expects profit margins to recover faster than
sales, but investments will also be higher: its plans call for Dollars 2bn
of investment in the region during the 1990s.
Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch household goods group, is looking favourably at
Latin America and the Pacific and their sometimes 'phenomenal' growth rates,
contrasting them with the position in the US and Japan where the challenge
is 'the laborious winning of market share'. In many developing countries, a
small rise in GDP is enough to bring many new people into markets.
Pepsico said this month that it would invest about Dollars 750m over the
next five years on its bottling operations, extending its distribution
network and marketing its products more aggressively in Mexico.
COLGATE-PALMOLIVE is another company that has seen steady growth in its
Latin American operations since 1985. Now the company is considering
acquisitions in several countries, some of which would be sizeable. It is
interested in extending joint ventures, such as that with Clorox in Mexico
to manufacture bleach. It invested Dollars 50m in the region last year; in
1993 the figure could be significantly higher.
If they want to expand in Latin America, companies such as Colgate-Palmolive
are likely to establish production facilities there rather than export: the
reason is that the low value-to-weight ratio of its products makes it
expensive to transport them.
There are other areas where the region appears attractive to foreign
investors, as the interest in the privatisation of Argentine utilities -
including British Gas's investment in the Buenos Aires gas distribution
company - shows.
Service industries - hotels and financial services, for example - have also
attracted foreign investment. Services have grown considerably in importance
in worldwide FDI: they represented a quarter of FDI stock at the end of the
1970s, but by the end of the 1980s, they represented half of the FDI stock
and 55-60 per cent of all new flows.
Yet, from the Latin American perspective, both service industries and
utilities are areas where competition from foreign tradeable goods is
limited - because there is no significant competition with imports.
Moreover, privatisation encourages capital inflows, but it is a one-off
phenomenon.
There is thus a need to look at the attraction of FDI in Latin America
industry by industry. Chocolate, toothpaste, water, hotels and banking are
important sectors, but it is still hard to see how direct investment in
these areas is going to yield increased exports. And on this, the success of
the model in large part depends.
But there is one area where foreign direct investors regularly mention Latin
America's comparative advantage: its wealth of natural resources. From the
FDI perspective, the freedom that the Chilean government has given to
foreign investors in exploiting its natural resources has been an important
element of Chile's success in attracting investment. Yet many countries -
including the region's two largest economies, Mexico and Brazil - have laws
which substantially forbid foreign investment in the mining and oil sectors.
Foreign raw material exploitation will not provide the answer to the
region's problems of development. But allowing it could well increase
capital flows to the region during a potentially difficult transitional
period when much domestic industrial capacity that depended on import
substitution for survival is closed down.
In fact, the main benefit of FDI over time will lie more in the transfer of
technology than in medium-term balance of payments financing. It fosters
industrial development and the creation of human capital, and provides
access to scarce technology, marketing links and management know-how.
Over a period of time, successful FDI entails a stream of service payments
which will reduce the transfers of resources. US Commerce Department
statistics show that in 1991 income from US direct investment in Mexico was
Dollars 2.3bn, which exceeded new direct investment from the US in that
year.
From 1965 to 1986, net transfers on FDI (that is new investment minus
remitted profits) to all developing countries were either negative or only
marginally positive. The current popularity of FDI in the region may
therefore wane as remittances start adversely to affect the balance of
payments.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (7): Impact is significant
 -Foreign direct investment
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE portfolio flows to all developing countries stagnated somewhat last
year, the importance of foreign direct investment continued to grow.
According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development,
international direct investment accounted for less than 20 per cent of total
private capital flows to developing countries at the beginning of the 1980s.
By 1987-89, this had risen to 60 per cent, in part because bank lending had
dried up.
In Latin America, FDI is already having a significant impact on the region's
balance of payments. While in 1988 it was equal to less than a third of the
region's net transfers abroad on debt, estimates for 1992 show FDI almost
equal to net transfers. Direct investment accounted for 65 per cent of
Chile's capital inflows in 1991, and 35 per cent of Mexico's.
There is no doubt that contributory factors behind this increasing inflow
have stemmed from within the region: the improved macroeconomic performance,
more welcoming regulatory regimes, the decline in Latin America's economic
nationalism and its privatisation programmes.
The development has also come against the background of an extraordinary
boom in cross-border investment that continued throughout the 1980s, but
which appears to have slowed down in the early 1990s as, one by one, the
main industrial economies have sunk into recession.
In the 1980s, according to the OECD, the total stock of FDI boomed globally
from about Dollars 500bn in 1980 to Dollars 1,500bn today. Worldwide flow of
FDI grew in the 1980s at an unprecedented average rate of about 29 per cent,
reaching close to Dollars 200bn in 1990.
This growth rate was five times that of world exports and 10 times world
output.
Such rapid growth meant that the percentage of FDI going to developing
countries fell markedly in the 1980s, even as in absolute terms the amount
rose.
The proportion going to developing countries declined from 20 per cent in
1980-84 to just over 10 per cent in 1985-89; Latin America's share of the
total dropped from 7.4 to 3 per cent of global inflows and that of Africa
from 2.5 to 0.6 per cent.
In the years 1985-90, when overall cross-border direct investment in
industrialised countries was growing at around 30 per cent a year, FDI into
Latin America was expanding at a more modest rate of 11 per cent.
ACCORDING to the figures, global FDI peaked in 1989 and fell in 1990 - a
development in part related to the end of the debt-financed cross-border
mergers and acquisitions boom in industrialised economies in the late 1980s.
The OECD figures unfortunately stop in 1990 and therefore it is difficult to
be more exact about developments since then.
However, there can be little doubt that overall cross-border FDI fell
sharply in 1991 and 1992. Meanwhile, figures from the World Bank suggest
continuing growth in FDI to all developing countries and into Latin America
in 1991 and 1992. Indeed, 1989 appears to have marked a low point for the
relative share that Latin America took in total FDI and in FDI to developing
countries.
Thus it seems that the growth of foreign direct investment in the region is
more than a function of the FDI boom of the 1980s. In some senses, this
continued growth in developing countries may in part be a reaction to that
boom: most acquisitions within the industrialised world during the 1980s are
already considered to have been overpriced failures.
In part, aggressive privatisation - which can happen only once - has swollen
the figures. Balancing this though,debt-for-equity swap programmes with
subsidies for non-privatisation investments have been largely abandoned or
have become irrelevant (as the secondary market prices of its debt rose
close to face value) in the case of Chile.
According to Ms DeAnne Julius, chief economist of the Royal Dutch/Shell
Group Latin America, the increased FDI flows to developing countries may be
more than a short-term phenomenon. She calculates that FDI to developing
countries could grow from Dollars 30bn in 1990 to Dollars 80bn (in 1990
dollars) in 2000, representing 30 per cent of world flows against 17 per
cent in 1990. Latin America, she notes, overtook east Asia as an FDI
destination in 1990.
The continued rise of FDI into Latin America is important too because it
demonstrates that Latin America may have less to fear from eastern Europe
than most of its governments thought perhaps two or three years ago.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (4): Sprinter at the front of the pack -
Behind the vibrant economic successes, frayed nerves are sometimes apparent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST August, Singapore's Business Times newspaper received an unwelcome
visit from officers of the government's Internal Security Department.
They questioned journalists, took away notebooks and computer files, and
subsequently the paper's editor, Mr Patrick Daniel, was among four people
charged under Singapore's official secrets act. His 'crime': publishing a
leaked preliminary estimate of the country's second quarter gross domestic
product which showed annual growth to be lower than expected at 4.6 to 4.8
per cent.
With the trial of those accused still continuing, the precise explanation
for this uniquely Singaporean story remains obscure. But the affair has
taken its place in the public consciousness as a vivid reminder of the
concern in the island state last summer over the economy.
Growth was falling after the blow to confidence delivered by the Gulf war in
1990-91, the US economy which is the principal market for Singapore's
exports was anaemic, the world consumer electronics industry on which a
large chunk of Singaporean manufacturing depends was in a serious recession,
and Singapore's attractiveness as a manufacturing location looked threatened
by a sharp rise in unit labour costs.
To the government it all had an ominous ring: the last time there had been
such a combination was in 1985, when Singapore experienced a serious
recession - its only one since independence and an event seared into the
minds of all Singaporeans.
As it turns out, the fears were massively overdone. Growth has continued at
a rate that the industrial countries can only envy, manufacturing output has
recovered after a drop in the first quarter, exports are surging, the
financial services sector has bounced back, the rise in labour and business
costs has moderated, and foreign investment is still pouring in.
The government now reckons that the economy bottomed out in the third
quarter of last year, and grew by 5.8 per cent for the year as a whole -
admittedly a slower rate than Singapore has been used to over the past two
decades but healthy even by comparison with the other newly industrialising
economies such as Hong Kong (5 per cent) and South Korea (4.9 per cent). And
the pace is accelerating: the government has just revised upwards its
estimate for this year's gdp to show expansion of 6 to 7 per cent. In all
seriousness, government ministers call it Singapore's 'soft landing'.
The country's success in steering through the threat of a sharp slowdown and
putting itself back on the path of more rapid expansion results from a
mixture of luck and judgment.
In the first place, the contraction in 1991 and the first half of 1992 would
have been much worse but for deft deployment of government funds to fuel a
domestic construction boom. The construction sector grew by 18 per cent last
year, aided by a burst of public spending on infrastructure such as roads,
the port, hospitals, schools and housing. Singapore remains in the fortunate
position of enjoying a substantial budget surplus, which enables the
government to turn the spending taps on or off at will.
Externally, strong growth in the south-east Asian neighbourhood also helped
carry the Singaporean economy through the first half of 1992, enabling it to
capitalise on its traditional role as a transport and communications hub.
But the main motors for its subsequent acceleration were twofold:
The unexpectedly strong recovery in America: non-oil exports to the US
increased by an impressive 12 per cent in the second half. Although
ministers do not expect performance to be sustained at quite that level in
1993, the US economy should be strong enough to offset weakness in
Singapore's European and Japanese markets.
Electronics exports. As maker of around half the world's computer disk
drives and of components for a wide range of consumer electronics products,
Singapore is uniquely exposed to the international fortunes of these
industries. Slowdown in the markets of the industrialised world and the
apparent saturation of demand for certain consumer electronics goods spread
gloom in the first few months of 1992.
Today, whereas computer manufacturers everywhere are bleeding from a savage
price war in personal computers, Singapore is benefiting from a resulting
surge in demand for disk drives, integrated circuits and computer
peripherals. And with new consumer electronics products beginning to pour
back on to the market, it is poised to win a healthy slice of that action
too.
Nevertheless, the worries being expressed last year have not vanished. The
government frets constantly about maintaining Singapore's position in the
contest for foreign investment, about the dangers of overheating in the
labour and property markets, and about achieving a sustainable, as opposed
to helter-skelter, rate of growth. It still has some reasons for concern.
The most obvious is the unit cost of labour. Just a year ago, it looked as
if a damaging gap was opening up between rapidly rising wages and much
slower improvements in productivity: nominal wages rose by 9.2 per cent in
1991, productivity by a miserable 1.5 per cent. In the first quarter of last
year, productivity actually fell by 0.9 per cent.
The picture has improved considerably since then: last year, wages grew by
7.5 per cent and productivity by an average of 3.1 per cent as manufacturing
output recovered.
Nevertheless, with unemployment below 3 per cent of the workforce, there is
precious little slack in the economy. Moreover, with the service sector
playing an increasingly important role, it is becoming more difficult all
the time to keep productivity rising in line with wages.
As Dr Richard Hu, finance minister, put it in his budget speech last month:
'Efforts to improve productivity and restructure the domestic economy to
squeeze more out of each unit of resource will face diminishing returns, as
we are already starting from a relatively high base.'
The government is working hard to keep business costs under control. In the
budget, for example, Dr Hu announced a cut in corporate tax next year from
30 to 27 per cent, to be offset by the introduction of a 3 per cent goods
and services tax (GST), and proclaimed the government's intention to get
corporate taxes down to 25 per cent in due course.
But ministers are well aware that Singapore's constraints of space, manpower
and resources will for the foreseeable future impose a natural limit on the
rate at which they an afford to let the economy grow. 'Our population is not
growing, but if we can sustain productivity growth of 3-4 per cent we should
be able to sustain 5-6 per cent economic growth,' says Mr Suppiah
Dhanabalan, trade and industry minister. 'Anything more would lead to
overheating.'
The real answer to such problems in the long term - enunciated every time a
minister opens his mouth in public these days - lies not in further boosting
the domestic economy but in capitalising on opportunities in the wider
region. The challenge Singapore faces is to equip itself for a major
investment drive into the rapidly growing economies around it in Asia, and
in this task it has only just begun.

<TEXT>
an apolitical politician.
Though an MP since 1984, Dr Hu is first and foremost a technocrat, groomed
in the private sector and eventually parachuted into high office. That was
10 years ago. 'One thing with politics is the loss of personal freedom . . .
I've been so long out of the private sector I can hardly remember what it
was like.'
Dr Hu, 66, gained his Ph. D. in chemical engineering from Birmingham
University and went on to lecture in England before returning to Singapore
in 1960. For more than 20 years he was with Shell, rising to become chief
executive of their operations first in Malaysia and then in Singapore.
Dr Hu's position would be envied by many of his colleagues round the world.
Since the mid 1980s Singapore has been running budget surpluses. With
foreign exchange reserves officially put at USDollars 40bn Singapore's
fiscal position does not cause the finance minister too many sleepless
nights.
Furthermore the nature of Singapore government - with its emphasis on a
unified, corporate approach - allows Dr Hu to manage his ministry in very
much the same way as he would the finances of a giant corporation. 'The
political part of this job is much less intense than it would be in the UK
or elsewhere,' says Dr Hu.
Nonetheless Dr Hu shares the views of Singapore's top leadership when it
comes to key policy issues. New tax structures were recently introduced,
with corporate and personal taxes lowered. The central aim of the changes is
to keep Singapore competitive.
'The competition for investment is going to be even greater in future.
Hitherto closed economies are opening up . . . protectionism is raising its
head everywhere, there's a great shortage of capital. Making our investment
climate more attractive is crucial.'
Dr Hu is keenly aware of the changes taking place in the region, with
Singapore's neighbours already nibbling away at the island republic's export
markets. 'We now consider Malaysia as one of our major competitors. It's
extraordinary how Malaysia has grown its industrial sector so fast.'
Dr Hu went to China in 1985 and returned again recently. 'The change is
amazing. The money is trickling down and consumer demand is shooting up. The
same thing will happen in Vietnam.'
Dr Hu feels there is a good chance of an economic upturn in the US - still
Singapore's main export market. He feels Japan has a great capacity for
recovery - if it can solve its political problems. But monetary developments
in Europe are viewed with dismay.
'One of the unfortunate by products of liberalising financial systems is
that the door is opened to speculators. As we've seen, they can knock
central banks down. Modern communications aids the process. It's so easy to
do now. That's one of the reasons we are reluctant to free the Singapore
dollar.'
Singapore has one of the highest per capita savings rates. Dr Hu defends
what is criticised as an over-cautious fiscal regime but liberalisation of
savings is now being investigated.
'As long as you preserve financial independence half your problems are
solved . . . if you borrow too much you lose sovereignty.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (6): One step up the ladder
 -Portfolio flows
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PORTFOLIO flows
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
investment in stocks and bonds - are widely considered to be one step up the
ladder of desirability.
Much of this investment goes into the stock market and into bidding up the
price of existing assets, but there is an element of new investment, to the
extent that these higher market levels allow for new issues of equity and
debt.
All developing countries have seen a dramatic increase in portfolio
investment flows, which trebled to Dollars 21bn in 1991 over the level of
1989, and were projected at around Dollars 27bn for 1992. Total volume of
portfolio flows now exceeds net flows of official finance to developing
countries, reflecting what is clearly the growing dominance of the private
sector in international finance. According to the World Bank, portfolio
flows to Latin America multiplied fourfold from 1990 to 1992.
Portfolio investors are not a homogeneous bunch - and neither can all
portfolio investment be viewed as equal. Apart from rich Latin Americans,
the universe of portfolio investors also includes aggressive speculative
investors such as the so-called hedge funds, which helped to cause havoc in
the European Monetary System last year, and conservative investment
institutions dipping a toe into more exotic markets in an attempt to improve
returns.
Some of this investment is therefore quite transitory; some more permanent.
The fact that sometimes relatively modest outflows from a stock market can
precipitate steep price declines may limit the mobility of this capital.
This is because some investors are unwilling to take large losses and prefer
to hold on to await a future price rally.
Some traders in the bond and equity markets argue that, over time, the
profile of the portfolio investors in Latin America has changed.
The first wave of buying was by investors who believed the price of assets
in the region had simply fallen too far: this was speculative capital
centred on trading desks, and to some extent hedge funds and wealthy
individuals. It was encouraged by the settlement in Mexico of a debt
reduction agreement which, along with low US interest rates, has taken the
debt question off the list of prime investor concerns.
Since then, into the bond market have moved buyers attracted by high
absolute yields - preferably in double digits - seeking an improvement in
credit. This group are important buyers of Eurobonds. Many do not look very
carefully at bond prospectuses - and they include individuals and mutual
funds focusing on emerging markets.
This group of investors - looking only at absolute yields and not worried
about the more subtle aspects of credit quality - had a role in temporarily
and unsustainably compressing yield spreads towards the middle of last year,
between borrowers of very different calibre.
THE other culprit was over-aggressive bidding by bond underwriters for bond
mandates: this left huge amounts of Latin American paper on the books of
underwriters late last year, and effectively closed the new-issue market for
several months. The backlog was only cleared this year by the rally in US
interest rates, which lifted the prices of all dollar-denominated bonds.
With US interest rates at current levels, it is unlikely that underwriters
will be able to rely on interest rate falls to bail them out a second time.
Nonetheless, some bond market traders say Latin bonds are moving into
another stage of evolution: sophisticated but often conservative
institutional investors are said to be moving in. If indeed this is
happening - and it should be facilitated by changes in the last couple of
years in US securities regulation, which have helped to reduce some of the
more onerous disclosure and prospectus requirements for issuers selling
securities to institutional investors - then the market in Latin American
bonds will be moving towards a more important maturity.
These institutions are careful asset allocators, which use modern portfolio
theory, buying bonds and equities essentially to diversify risk. They are
interested in good credit quality and liquidity, and focus on the spreads or
margins over US Treasury bill rates. They will seek diversification
benefits: examining, for example, correlations between, say, US and Mexican
government bonds.
The justification for portfolio diversification by investment institutions
is stronger in the case of equities than it is for bonds. Dollar bonds,
issued by whomever, tend to track the US bonds market; while, for non-dollar
bonds, the perceived exchange rate risk against the dollar is to some extent
built into the yield differentials between that market and the dollar bond
market.
For equity investors, this is not the case, and there has been a gradually
expanding interest in the region's stock markets from institutions. For the
most part, Latin American stock markets are followed by the emerging-markets
group within investment institutions, which controls a small but generally
growing percentage of the overall portfolio.
In the UK, there has perhaps been a longer tradition of investment than in
the US in what we now call emerging markets. But the traditional emerging
markets for UK investors have been in the countries of the Commonwealth, and
only recently has interest arisen in Latin America. Far more important for
Latin America is the attitude of US institutions, some of which already
treat certain Mexican stocks as part of their North American, rather than
their emerging markets, portfolio.
The potential supply of capital flows from this source to the region is
immense, even if only a tiny percentage of the institutions' portfolios are
devoted to the region. In the US alone, institutional investors hold more
than Dollars 6,000bn of investable funds. Indeed, if these investors decide
to follow their portfolio theory, the optimal level of Latin American
investment in a portfolio is considerably above their actual levels, leaving
much scope for growth.
There are many ways in which countries can improve the friendliness of their
markets to such investors: improving and enforcing regulation, improving the
quality of corporate disclosure, improving market liquidity and the like.
Governments can issue bonds in the international markets across the maturity
spectrum to provide benchmarks for other issuers from that country, a tactic
followed by Mexico.
They can also act to reduce the likelihood of disorderly borrowing abroad -
of which there were several examples in 1992. Although it may go against the
grain of liberalisation of financial markets, some bankers and academics
believe governments should impose a queueing system on fund raisings in the
international bond and equity markets, such as that operated until recently
by the Bank of England.
This is because a mispriced or badly-timed issue by one fundraiser - there
were several examples of these last year - can all too easily affect market
psychology and prevent others from having access to the markets. It is also
argued that some kind of quality control is worth considering on would-be
issuers. This is important in the international bond market, where no Latin
bond issue has defaulted in recent years - a record which, sooner or later,
probably will fall, with potentially disruptive affects for other borrowers.
In the shorter term, there is concern about the relatively poor performance
and volatility of both Latin bond and stock markets in 1992. Salomon
Brothers' index of Brady bonds showed a total return of 4.6 per cent for
1992. Stock market investors also had a much more difficult year in 1992
then they did in 1991. Double-digit gains were observed only in Peru, Mexico
and Colombia, and in both Mexican and Peruvian markets there was
extraordinary volatility. This was after a year in which there were gains
above 100 per cent in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. Chile
rose by 90 per cent, while Venezuela was a 'disappointing' 34 per cent.
Although not usually classed as portfolio capital, there is another
potential source of private capital that has been largely forgotten in
recent years: the commercial banks.
If international banks are to become a more important source of finance for
the region during the 1990s, the growth will be gradual. Not only will the
experience of the 1970s make them cautious for some time to come; but, more
important, it will also take time for banking regulators throughout the
world to reduce the mandated provisions that banks have to make against
loans to developing countries.
There is, however, scope for project investment - particularly where loans
can be repaid through receivables arising from cross-border commerce - and
support for companies planning direct investment: at the moment, most
favoured source of foreign capital.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (5): A scale of
desirability for capital flows
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAPITAL is flowing back into Latin America, but not all capital flows are
created equal.
'Some types of flows seem more desirable than others,' says Stephany
Griffiths-Jones, of Sussex University's Institute of Development Studies.
Bottom of this scale of desirability, from the recipient economy point of
view, is speculative short-term capital. Of this, perhaps the most risky
inflows are those resulting from foreign currency borrowing by domestic
companies to lodge money in money markets at home. At the top of the scale,
it is generally agreed, is foreign direct investment aimed at enlarging
productive capacity.
For comfort's sake, too high a proportion of the inflows into Latin America
over the past few years is 'hot money' - money attempting to capture profit
from interest differentials or foreign exchange market inefficiencies, and
which is likely to be withdrawn as soon as the perceived risk associated
with the investment increases.
JP Morgan, the New York bank, estimated late last year that Treasury bills,
local currency deposits and other short-term funding account for between
one-third and one-half of Mexico's capital inflows.
Arbitrage borrowings by Latin American companies in dollars may also be
storing up problems for the future: the British investment bank Morgan
Grenfell estimates that 60 per cent of Argentine corporate debt is in US
dollars; much of that is clearly invested in the Argentine money markets.
The reason why the dependence on short-term capital is such a critical issue
for Mexico and Argentina hangs on their exchange rate policies. Both are
using exchange rate policy as a tool in the battle against inflation,
leading to an appreciation in the real value of their currencies against the
dollar.
Argentina fixed its currency to the dollar in April 1991. Mexico, which
until October was pursuing a daily slide of the peso amounting to a 2.3 per
cent nominal devaluation a year, is now allowing the currency to float
within a target band that would permit a maximum depreciation of twice that.
The problem is that so much of the short-term inflows depend on an elusive
commodity: confidence. If the view grows that a big devaluation is in the
offing, then short-term capital will not hang around to wait and see. The
impact on international financial market confidence could be such that no
politically sustainable level of interest rates will be enough to tempt it
back.
This possibility can be cushioned by the now significant reserves, and in
the early part of this year short-term capital inflows appeared to be
holding up relatively well - albeit, in Mexico, at the cost of higher
interest rates. Nonetheless the risk remains of over-dependence on this type
of capital.
Indeed, a slowing down of inflows may occur because of events completely
external to the region. Some short-term inflows have certainly been
encouraged by recent unusually low US interest rates and the low returns on
investments generally in the US and other industrialised countries.
IN Mexico's case, much depends on the passage of the North American Free
Trade Agreement through the legislatures of Mexico, Canada and the US. The
biggest question here is the attitude of the US Congress to the accord - and
signs, one way or the other, about the attitudes of US legislators - are
already having a significant impact on capital flows. Sensitive to these
concerns are domestic residents bringing home flight capital, salted away in
the 1970s and 1980s. This group, until a couple of years ago, accounted for,
according to some estimates, half of the region's private capital inflows.
The InterAmerican Development Bank has estimated that more recently almost a
quarter of the funds flowing into Mexico have been controlled by Mexican
investors.
The trigger for the return of much of this money was the simple lifting of
capital controls across the region, which gave residents comfort that they
could take their money out of the country. Some flight capital is also
obviously linked with drugs trafficking, although this is more important in
some countries than in others. Drugs money responds to the concerns of all
investors - for example, low returns in established markets - as well as to
special concerns such as the clampdown on money-laundering in the US and
other banking centres following the BCCI scandal.
All told, however, the influence of returning flight capital on overall
flows has probably fallen in the past two years as more foreigners have
begun to invest. Latin Americans are not, of course, simply parking money on
deposit in banks or short-term government paper. They have also repatriated
capital as portfolio investors in the region's stock markets and as
important buyers of Eurobonds from Latin American issuers.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (3): On the crest of a wave -
Electronics profile: SGS-Thomson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE is continually worried about losing its competitive edge. Nowhere
is this more keenly felt than in electronics, which accounts for almost 40
per cent of total manufacturing output and more than 40 per cent of domestic
exports.
Concern focuses on rising wage levels and insufficient growth in
productivity. But Mr Milivoj von Somogy, head of Asia Pacific operations for
the European electronics giant SGS-Thomson, disagrees.
'In Singapore we can work 365 days per year. That's not possible in Europe.
It's not only costs - it's the quality of labour we have here as well. And
despite rising wages our total labour costs here are between Dollars 4 and
Dollars 6 per hour - that's not so bad for the type of high tech work we are
doing.'
SGS-Thomson started low cost assembly operations in Singapore in 1969. In
1982 it built its first wafer fabrication plant and now produces about 100m
pieces per month of various computer chips from its Singapore operations.
Though core technology development is still carried out in Europe,
SGS-Thomson's Singapore operations now employ 1,500 to produce increasingly
sophisticated so called 'front end' products. Another 3,200 are employed in
'back end' operations in nearby Malaysia.
'Initially low labour costs brought us to this part of the world,' says Mr
Somogy. 'Now we can source the bulk of our materials here, there is the
expertise available and most importantly sales in this region are growing so
fast it's a problem to meet demand.'
Other electronics businesses tell a similar story. Companies that in the
1960s were assembling black and white TV sets have evolved to design and
manufacture a comprehensive range of final products, sub-assemblies,
components and parts for both industrial and consumer electronics
industries.
More than 250 electronics companies in Singapore produced an estimated
SDollars 31bn worth of goods last year, a 6 per cent rise over the 1991
figure. Products cover almost the entire electronics sector, from consumer
goods to disk drives, semiconductors and printed circuit boards.
Singapore now accounts for about 50 per cent of total world output of
computer disk drives, with about 18m unit drives valued at SDollars 8bn
produced last year. This represents an increase of 28 per cent in volume
terms over the 1991 figure.
After an industry shakeout in 1991 and a dip in trade in the first half of
1992 overall industry growth surged by 13.9 per cent in the third quarter of
the year, a trend which was continued through the end of 1992.
Strong growth is expected to continue through 1993, with an expected upturn
in the US, Singapore's biggest export market, absorbing more than 40 per
cent of total industry exports.
As the electronics industry has become more regionalised, Singapore has
developed into the main electronics re-export centre in south-east Asia.
Re-exports now account for about 25 per cent of Singapore's total
electronics exports.
The electronics industry faces various challenges. Neighbouring countries -
particularly Malaysia and Thailand - have successfully developed their own
electronics industries and threaten Singapore's export competitiveness,
particularly in consumer electronics. Singapore has continuously sought to
upgrade its activities.
New electronics centres such as Penang in Malaysia are already tempting some
companies to move certain operations out of Singapore. Some employers
complain of an increasing incidence of 'job hopping' among electronics
workers. There is also concern about government restrictions on importing
labour and the costs incurred by a special foreign workers levy imposed by
the authorities.
Electronics is still a sector overwhelmingly dominated by the
multinationals. But more efforts are being made to integrate local concerns
into the production process. The government recently set up an Institute of
Microelectronics to assist the local electronics industry in spearheading
research and development and to train skilled R &amp; D personnel.
Despite some problems investor confidence in Singapore's electronics
industry continues to be maintained. Investment commitments in the industry
in 1992 reached SDollars 1.4bn - more than 40 per cent of total investment
committed.
Companies such as SGS-Thomson realise that more investments and an ever
stronger presence in the region are vital to take advantage of opportunities
in the Asia-Pacific, the world's fastest growing market. 'In terms of sales
of our semiconductor market in the Asia Pacific has caught up with Europe,'
says Mr Somogy. 'In the Singapore/Malaysia area our sales now exceed those
of either France or Britain and are the same as those of Germany. China is
opening up and presents a tremendous market. I don't see much change in the
growth trend in this region for the next 10 to 15 years.
'We had 33 per cent growth in the Asia Pacific last year and expect a
minimum of the same growth again. It's no longer a question of orders.
Instead it's a question of whether we can supply fast enough.'

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Singapore (2): Investors' paradise - The business
ethic that sucks in the cash
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW GOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS RECENTLY as 1980, there was no such thing as a Singaporean computer
components industry. Today the island republic is the world's largest
manufacturer of computer disk drives, accounting for more than half of world
production, and a big supplier of a wide range of other computer
peripherals, semiconductors and electronics equipment.
In the early 1970s, the textile industry accounted for some 17 per cent of
manufacturing employment in Singapore. Now the figure is well below 10 per
cent, and declining.
These are two examples of the extraordinary swirl of change that continues
to invigorate the Singaporean economy. They help to illustrate how a country
with no natural resources, a miniscule land area and a static indigenous
workforce has managed to carve out its position as a leading competitive
player in a number of international industries, from consumer electronics to
oil refining and petrochemicals.
The Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter would have recognised what is
happening. Writing in the first half of this century, he called it 'creative
destruction' - the process of unremitting innovation and renewal in an
economy affected by the free play of market forces. In Singapore's case, the
market is the world, and it has exposed itself to - and benefitted from -
the full force of international competition by maintaining a stance towards
foreign investment as open and unrestrictive as you will find anywhere. Some
3,000 multinationals have operations of some kind on the island, more than
750 of them in manufacturing.
Foreign investors are as much as ever the motor of Singapore's development.
Initially attracted by its low-wage workforce and by heavy public investment
in an ultramodern infrastructure - for two decades investment has
represented 35 to 40 per cent of annual gross domestic product, higher than
in any other industrialised or industrialising country including Japan -
they are constantly encouraged by government to spend on upgrading their
plants with the latest technologies. The aim is to create a virtuous circle
in which higher labour productivity earns higher wages, and low-wage,
labour-intensive businesses either die or move offshore.
Singapore is uniquely unsentimental about preserving industries which have
lost their competitive edge: the timber business, for example, once a local
mainstay, is now virtually extinct, while textile manufacturing on the
island has moved inexorably to the high-value end of the market while
spinning off low-cost operations to Malaysia and other neighbouring
countries. Their place has been taken by productive, technology-driven
industries such as consumer electronics, telecommunications equipment and
precision engineering.
The last 20 years provide countless examples of this shift - as always,
under the guiding hand of government bodies such as the Economic Development
Board. Having established itself as an oil refining and bunkering centre,
Singapore moved into bulk petrochemicals and is now assiduously developing
higher-value products such as speciality chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
The trick consists not just in attracting new investors: more importantly,
it involves encouraging heavy investment by those already installed, so that
technology companies such as Texas Instruments that came to Singapore in the
early days have repeatedly upgraded their locally-manufactured product mix.
And the search goes on: Singapore has remained especially alert to global
changes in the consumer electronics industry. It is now positioning itself
as an important production base for digital compact cassette players and
notebook computers.
Mr Philip Yeo, the hyperactive EDB chairman and Singapore's industrial czar,
reckons that of every fresh investment dollar that comes to the island, two
thirds represents spending by companies already in place. The increasing
quality of those investments is evident from the pattern last year.
Manufacturing investment commitments reached a record SDollars 3.5 bn, 21
per cent up on 1991, and the prospective yield on those projects, in terms
of gross value-added per worker, rose to SDollars 240,175 - more than three
times the existing average in the manufacturing sector.
This constant drive for higher value-added makes sense given Singapore's
severe physical and demographic constraints. It is also getting more urgent
all the time in view of the intensifying competition for investment among
low-wage Asian economies, which are themselves gradually following Singapore
'up the value chain'.
To understand why, compare labour and land costs in Singapore with those
elsewhere in the region. The starting wage for a production worker in
Singapore is SDollars 630 a month; in Penang, Malaysia, it is SDollars 264;
and in Vietnam it is SDollars 80. In Singapore, a square metre of industrial
land costs 10 times what it does in Penang and 30 times what it does in
Vietnam.
Unable to compete on wages, land or on the size of its domestic market,
Singapore has quite deliberately priced itself out of the business of
low-cost manufacturing; partly for political reasons, the government will
not prop up labour-intensive industries by allowing companies to import more
foreign workers. Instead, it has been forced to develop alternative
attractions to retain the loyalty of its multinational partners.
As Mr Goh Chok Tong, the prime minister, put it last year in terms that
might be a corporate mission statement: 'We must be competitive in combining
the whole range of factors and produce a package that is better than what
our competitors can offer. This requires hardworking and highly skilled
workers, good management and government, a politically secure environment,
good physical and social infrastructure.
'It also requires us to be alert to changes in technology, investment and
market trends. It means constant restructuring of our economy to have a mix
of industries in which we are competitive.'
What this means in practice was mapped out in a strategic plan produced by a
committee of business and labour leaders, government officials and academics
in October 1991. It recommended a series of measures aimed at improving the
skills of the workforce, at encouraging companies to automate and shift
labour-intensive activities offshore, and at getting multinationals to think
of Singapore as a managerial and service hub for South-east Asia rather than
just a production base.
Specific moves in train include:
Research and development. In co-operation with the multinationals, Singapore
is now engaged in a big effort to boost R &amp; D activities on the island. It
has established a National Science and Technology Board to oversee a
proliferation of research institutes in a wide variety of disciplines from
microelectronics to biotechnology and, by providing financial incentives, to
double R &amp; D spending to 2 per cent of gdp by 1995. In the same period, it
wants to raise the proportion of scientists and engineers in the workforce
to 40 per 10,000 workers from the present 28. That compares with R &amp; D
spending of 3 per cent of gdp in Japan and 1.8 per cent in South Korea.
Recruitment and training. The EDB is mounting a targeted recruitment drive
overseas with a view to bringing engineers, computer scientists and other
skilled manpower to Singapore from Europe, North America, Russia and other
Asian countries including India. The aim is twofold: to pre-empt a looming
skills shortage in the region as a whole, and to compensate for the fact
that the government finds it difficult to lure Singaporeans into factory
jobs as opposed to what they perceive as the more glamorous services sector.
'We have to make a more concerted effort to recruit people now because the
other countries in the region are growing,' says Mr Suppiah Dhanabalan,
trade and industry minister.
In addition, Singapore is pitching to become a regional training centre for
multinationals in Asia. The US communications giant Motorola, for example,
recently sent a team to train on the island from the plant it has
established in China. The commercial spinoff for Singapore is obvious. 'That
way, I can sell more components,' says Mr Yeo.
Regional investment. Singapore's attempt to push multinationals' low-cost,
lower-skill operations offshore is now accelerating. Its main focus is the
so-called 'Growth Triangle', an unusual initiative to foster economic
integration between Singapore, the southern Malaysian state of Johor and
Indonesia's nearby Riau islands.
The EDB actively encourages investment in Johor, and Singapore is
collaborating with Indonesia's Salim group to build industrial parks on
Batam and Bintan, two islands in the Riau group. Attracted by the prospect
of working with Singaporean expertise and efficiency and Indonesian wages,
more than 30 companies have taken space on Batam, and exports from the
plants already operational are growing fast.
Here, too, the gains for Singapore far outweigh any concern about lost
investment, for companies establishing operations in Johor or Batam
generally do so in order to perform more sophisticated tasks in Singapore.
There cannot be many examples of an industrialising country actively
encouraging foreign investors to go elsewhere. The fact that Singapore does
is a measure of its confidence both in the increasing sophistication of its
economy and in the enticing prospects for growth in the wider region.

FT  29 MAR 93 / Survey of Latin American Finance (4): A rerun of the debt
crisis?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sudden rush of capital into Latin America has inevitably raised
questions about what happens if it stops. As the combined current account
deficit of the region widens sharply, as it did last year, the parallels are
already being drawn with the years that led up to the debt crisis of the
1980s.
There are significant differences, however, between what is happening now
and the experience of the late 1970s and early 1980s which should reduce the
risks:
Then, budget deficits and inflation were on the rise, while now inflation is
declining and budgets are balanced.
Then, the borrowing was mostly done by the public sector and this time it
has been private. This does not comfort everybody: the worrying exception
last time was Chile, where the government was eventually forced to assume
private foreign debt, mostly owed by Chilean banks. 'Private debt in Latin
America has a way of becoming public debt,' notes one US economist.
Then, the inflows were largely bank-financed and with interest rates
floating along with US rates. This time the mix of inflows is significantly
more varied - including equity, more borrowing at fixed interest rates, and
an important component of direct investment. Equity investment does not
create debt and dividends, in contrast to interest payments, are only paid
in the event of investment success. Although in some countries debt
servicing would still constitute a problem if US interest rates rose
sharply, the new capital flows do not increase the vulnerability of the
region to US interest increases in the way that the debt inflows of the
1970s did.
Then, the capital inflows represented a much larger percentage of regional
domestic product than in the 1990s. In 1978-82, capital inflows into the
region as a whole represented 7 per cent of domestic product, in 1990-91,
about 4 per cent and last year 4.8 per cent. However, the averages deceive:
Mexico's inflows represented last year over 8.4 per cent of gross domestic
product.
There is another crucial difference. Unlike in 1978-82, official reserves
have been rising as authorities have actively intervened in the foreign
exchange market. Many governments thus have a substantial cushion of foreign
exchange reserves in case of troubles ahead.
The current account deficit has been very much the counterpart to the
capital inflows. Figures from the Economic Commission for Latin America and
the Caribbean show a doubling of the region's current account deficit,
excluding Brazil's large surplus, to Dollars 39bn last year from Dollars
18bn in 1991. This of itself is not necessarily bad: it in part reflects the
recovery from the 1980s recession which released demand for both investment
and consumer goods from abroad.
Nonetheless, Mexico's current account deficit of around 6 per cent of its
GDP in 1992 accounted for half of the region's combined current account
deficit, excluding Brazil. Many forecasts suggest the deficit will now rise
to Dollars 27bn this year, 8 per cent of GDP.
EVEN though this is mainly the result of private sector activity, this does
not mean it is of no concern to the government - 'in practice, large private
sector current account deficits can have important and, frequently, adverse
implications for the public sector,' says Mr Paul Luke of the British
investment bank, Morgan Grenfell. According to the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development, which published a generally optimistic report
on Mexico last year: 'It could once again become difficult to finance a
current account deficit, which as a percentage of GDP is close to GDP
growth.' Continued current account deficits at current levels implied rises
in the ratio of foreign liabilities to GDP 'in excess of anything observed
historically.'
More accurately, the question is not whether the deficit can be financed -
because after the fact a country's current account deficit will always equal
inflows of capital adjusted for changes in reserves. The question is at what
level of interest rates and therefore of economic growth will the
equilibrium between capital inflows and current account deficit be reached.
The big current account deficits highlight another issue: exports are not
rising quick enough for some people's liking. 'The model is one of
export-led growth; the problem is that in most countries exports have yet to
take off,' says Victor Bulmer-Thomas, head of the Institute for Latin
American Studies at the University of London.
This underlines that Latin America's return to growth has so far mostly
arisen directly from the lifting of the constraint on access to foreign
exchange. This first stage of growth arises because capital inflows allow an
economy to spend more than it produces. The importance of this should not be
minimised - it has a valuable role in boosting confidence and kick-starting
the economy. 'The value of this initial positive effect should not be
underestimated, especially in a region emerging from a 'lost decade' in
terms of growth and development,' says Stephany Griffith-Jones of Sussex
University's Institute of Development Studies in a recent book. It is
however a temporary phenomenon.
The second - more long-standing - beneficial effect on growth of capital
inflows depends on the extent to which they finance growth in productive
capacity. In the 1970s debt splurge, we now know that capital inflows
generated insufficient new productive capacity to provide the future income
that was necessary to finance the loans. Now the crucial second stage of
growth depends on to what extent the inflows are directed to investment and
how productive it is.
If enough efficient investment takes place and output rises sufficiently, it
is more likely that future debt servicing will be financeable without
problems. In Mexico, some capital inflows are financing new factories and
machinery for foreign and domestic investors. But the Mexican statistics -
with their broad definition of intermediate goods - do not really permit a
judgement of the extent to which the flows are financing consumption or
investment. Moreover, some inflows which might be unequivocally defined as
investment are going into construction and real estate projects, which may
only obliquely, if at all, help to provide foreign currency income streams
to service the financings. Mexico, for example, has been borrowing in
dollars to finance toll-road construction.
